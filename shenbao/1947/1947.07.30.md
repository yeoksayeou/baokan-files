### Wei Envoy Meets with Political Leaders, Adopting Opinions on the Current Situation from All Sides; Mo Teh-hui and Others Discuss the Importance of the Northeast

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] The American Embassy announced: Besides continuing his routine consultations with his advisors on the 29th, Wei De-mai also received a number of Chinese figures. He spent most of the morning in discussions with political figures. Around 10 o'clock, Zhang Dongsun, Luo Longji, Huang Yanpei, and Zhang Bojun, all four from the Democratic League, were the first group to visit, talking for about an hour. After they left, social dignitaries like Government Commissioner Mo Dehui and Youth Party leaders Zeng Qi and Executive Committee member Zhou Qianchong successively visited. Purifoy also met with Wei Envoy in the morning and had a high-level discussion. In the afternoon, he successively received Li Zhenfan, former member of the Military Affairs Commission, and Tang Zong, Director of the Police Headquarters. Wei De-mai had lunch and dinner with Ambassador Stuart on the 29th. Even amid his busy work until 6 p.m., he took time to go with his advisors to Xiaguan in the rain, taking a small boat to cruise on the Yangtze River for a short rest, using the river breeze and clear currents to eliminate the fatigue of the week. The following is a summary of the talks between various people and Wei Envoy: Leaders of the Democratic League, such as Zhang Dongsun, expressed their hope that the goal of American aid to China would be to assist China in moving towards peaceful unification, and they did not want American aid to China to prolong the civil war. Wei said, "I am very willing to help the Chinese people, and at the same time I hope that the Chinese people can help themselves." He then talked about his mission to China this time, which was to collect various factual materials for reference in providing aid to China. Mo Dehui and Zeng Qi visited Wei De-mai separately at 11 a.m. and 12 p.m. today. During the hour-long conversation, they explained the relationship between the Northeast and the world situation in a serious manner, and asked the United States to pay attention to the Soviet Union's ambitions in the Northeast and actively assist our government so that world peace would not become a mirage. The reporter visited Mr. Mo Dehui on the evening of the 29th. He said that his meeting with Wei Envoy was arranged by Ambassador Stuart. "They exchanged views on general issues in China, and particularly emphasized that they would never give up the Northeast. People in the Northeast also have no intention of splitting." Wei Envoy attached great importance to the two points raised by Mo. In his conversation with Wei Envoy, Zeng Qi, in addition to analyzing the progress of domestic affairs, especially pointed out that the Northeast is related to the future destiny of the entire world. He also used an article published in the American "Time Magazine" on July 21, "What Price for Peace," as the conclusion to his conversation with Wei. The main points of the article stated: "If Moscow has four hundred million Chinese or Indians and their resources working for Russia for thirty years, then the prestige of the communists will certainly increase even more than the United States," then the United States will not be allowed thirty years to prepare to deal with this disaster. Russia plus Europe may be stronger than the United States, and at that time it will not be possible to prevent the "communists from including Asia, and the security of the United States cannot be bought at any price."

Zeng Qi Provides Two Documents, Expressing Don't Let History Repeat Itself

It is also learned that: In front of Ambassador Stuart's residence, in order to strengthen Envoy's impression of the Northeast issue, he especially presented to him before leaving two copies of the telegrams sent by Zhang Kegong, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Youth Party, to British Prime Minister MacDonald on July 11, 1932, and to French Prime Minister Herriot on July 12 of the same year, asking Wei to pay attention to the modern value of these two historical telegrams. The original telegrams are as follows: Zeng Qi's telegram to British Prime Minister MacDonald: "I sincerely hope that Your Excellency and European politicians, in addition to paying attention to European peace, will also pay attention to Asian peace. It must be known that the seriousness of the Sino-Japanese issue is no less than that of the German-French issue; if you only solve the European issue and put the Asian issue on hold, I am afraid that the flames of the Second World War will eventually start in the East and spread to the West. This is what I most want to awaken the attention of Your Excellency and European politicians." Telegram to French Prime Minister Herriot: "I sincerely hope that Your Excellency and European politicians, in addition to paying attention to Western issues, do not forget the seriousness of Eastern issues, especially the issue of the three northeastern provinces, and make fair, swift, and effective claims, so that the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Pact of Paris, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, which Mr. Briand and world politicians have worked hard to create, will not become waste paper, eventually leading to the Second World War, spreading from Asia to Europe."

### There Has Been Significant Progress in China's Political Structure; Zeng Qi Lists Facts to Prove This When Meeting with Wei Envoy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Chinese Youth Party, and Zhou Qianchong, a member of the Standing Committee of the party, visited Wei De-mai on the morning of the 29th. He first thanked Wei for his achievements in helping China win the victory during the war, and called Wei a friend of China in times of trouble. He then described the party's participation in the National Assembly and the reorganization of the government, saying that there had been significant progress in China's political structure, such as: (1) the government has changed from a one-party government to a three-party government. (2) the amendment of the Organizational Law of the National Government. (3) replacing the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction with a Common Program for Governance. (4) abolishing the rituals of the one-party system (such as reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, etc.). (5) the Kuomintang's party fees are no longer paid by the national treasury. (6) Regular general elections will be held to begin constitutional governance. The political parties that participated in the drafting of the constitution are now jointly negotiating the election process, and an unprecedentedly heated election is about to begin. China's political structure is undergoing major changes. The biggest changes in China's politics after constitutional governance are: (1) changing from top-down politics to bottom-up politics. (2) changing from the Eastern examination system to the Western election system. (3) changing from a government without a standing public opinion organ to supervise it to a government with a standing public opinion organ to supervise it (4) changing from a one-party system to a multi-party system. Wei expressed doubts about whether universal suffrage could be implemented, since there are too many illiterate people in China? Zeng said that the initial experiment would indeed be difficult, but its effects would be: (1) it could establish the principle of "sovereignty resides in the people," making the people regard themselves as masters. (2) it could implement "political education" so that the people's level would increase due to the election. Wei also agreed, and they parted happily after talking for about fifty minutes.

### News Advisor Denies Rumors

Special Attention Paid to the Democratic League is Nonsense

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] Watson, the news advisor to Wei De-mai, denied to reporters on the 29th that a certain news agency reported that the US government had instructed the mission to pay special attention to the Democratic League and collect more relevant materials. He said that the report was pure nonsense. The mission's tasks had already been thoroughly instructed by Truman and Marshall, and after arriving in Nanjing, they had not received any orders from Washington to treat a certain group of people differently. Their task was a general "investigation of facts" and had nothing to do with personnel. Watson also said that the four advisors who came with Wei visited the heads of various relevant agencies and key personnel on the 29th to discuss and collect information. It is reported that political advisor Sprouse went to Meiyuan New Village alone to talk with them after Zhang Dongsun of the Democratic League returned.

### Whether to Open Trade with Japan is Awaiting a Decision by the State Council; The Executive Yuan Discusses It Enthusiastically

— A Comment

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] After the All-Economic Conference discussed and decided to postpone the opening of trade with Japan on the 28th, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan. The case was the most important issue on the agenda of the political affairs meeting on the 29th, and it was discussed for more than two hours. Each member present spoke several times, extensively expressing opinions on foreign affairs, economy, finance, industry, and commerce. Some believe that opening trade with Japan is beneficial to us. There are two main opinions: one is based on what Chairman Chiang said in his broadcast to Japan after the victory, that the attitude towards Japan should be generous and forgiving; the other is that all countries have adopted an open policy, and we should not give up this right. Others believe that it should be postponed, and their opinions are based on the current economic crisis facing China and the situation of industrial and commercial depression. They believe that it should be postponed. Without Zhang Qun's conclusion, it was decided to collect and organize the opinions of both sides and submit them to the State Council for a final decision.

[One Nanjing Dispatch of the 29th] In the regular meeting of the political affairs meeting on the 29th, before discussing the proposals, Bai Chongxi, Wang Shijie, Xue Dubi, and Huo Baoshu gave very detailed reports on the recent military, foreign affairs, water conservancy, and relief situations.

[United Press, Manila, 29th] Philippine representative to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, Alberto, said on his way to Shanghai that trade relations between the Philippines and Shanghai should be strengthened. At present, trade between the Philippines and Shanghai is almost at a standstill due to the instability of China's currency and the difficulty of import and export licenses. However, he believes that once the above situation improves, trade between the Philippines and Shanghai will increase sharply.

### America Gradually Recognizes the Difficult Situation in China

[This newspaper reported] San Francisco, 29th broadcast: New York "World Telegram" wrote an editorial saying: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's call for the American press to give China's problems more sympathetic consideration is worthy of our deep thought. China's social system is different from that of other countries. If its essence is not understood and it is measured by Western standards, it is easy to cause distorted impressions of this vast and complex country. When Japan launched the war in 1937, the so-called Republic of China existed only in name. Warlords and communists divided and occupied the area. From 1937 to 1941, China resisted the invaders independently. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the national army in repeated battles and finally retreated to Chongqing. At that time, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in a difficult situation and could not start to reform the domestic situation. However, in 1944, the American newspapers demanded a change in the Chinese political system, saying that the United States also had a stake in Chairman Chiang's war against the Communists. Not long ago, the US State Department insisted that Chairman Chiang should invite the Communist Party to join his government. Today, Americans are gradually recognizing the difficult situation in China.

### Amidst Discussions on Trade with Japan, Visiting Industrial and Commercial Circles in Shanghai; General Advocacy for Strengthening Import Controls

[This Newspaper Reported] At a time when the issue of opening private trade with Japan is being hotly debated in the capital, our reporter has specifically visited people in industrial and commercial circles in this city to ask for a calm view of the matter. The general opinion is that the crisis and anxiety in China's industrial circles are indeed justified, because although there are import controls at present, it has been rumored that among the Japanese goods easily imported by the China Trust Bureau, there are as many as 30,000 yards of wool fabric, which is a prohibited import. Therefore, it is doubtful whether import controls can protect China's industry. However, the United States is currently very eager to restore trade with Japan. If other countries have restored trade with Japan, and China alone holds a different view, it is actually impossible. Therefore, there are only two ways to remedy the situation: one is to strengthen import controls. Any goods that threaten China's national industries should absolutely not be allowed to be imported. On the contrary, those that help China's production are not subject to this restriction. For example, if factories in Taiwan need Japanese machine parts, they can be replenished from this source. In addition, China should increase tariff rates and raise the cost of imported Japanese goods, making them unable to compete with domestic products. This is also an effective method. A certain business leader pointed out that resisting the dumping of Japanese goods can only be done through the import management system. It is currently effective for British and American goods, and it should also be effective when used for Japanese goods in the future. What should be noted is that American capital has participated in Japan's industry, and China is eager for American economic assistance, so restricting the import of Japanese goods is not a simple matter. As for the fear of smuggling Japanese goods, it is not necessary, because due to shipping routes, the areas where Japanese goods were heavily smuggled in the past were the Northeast and North China, which are currently under the control of the CCP. Even if the United States wants to sell Japanese goods, it is beyond its power. Smuggling in Hong Kong is not a concern due to shipping routes and the relationship with the United Kingdom.

### Overseas Chinese in South Korea Have No Intention of Immediate Evacuation

### Fuzhong, Yangtze, and Other Companies Violated Import and Export Regulations; Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs Investigated and Reported

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] According to today's Central Daily News: Fuzhong, Yangtze, and other companies have been found to have violated import and export control regulations in recent years. The highest authorities have ordered the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs to conduct a thorough investigation. The entire investigation has now been completed, and the two ministries have jointly submitted a report. The report lists the following: (1) the date of implementation of the ban on luxury goods imports and restrictions on foreign exchange settlements; (2) the foreign exchange settlement situation of the Central Bank; (3) the actual import situation of Fuzhong and other companies. Details are as follows:

(1) Date of Implementation of the Ban on Luxury Goods Imports and Restrictions on Foreign Exchange Settlements: According to the government's repeatedly promulgated regulations, foreign exchange settlements were not allowed and imports were prohibited for cars with a capacity of seven passengers or less and a factory price exceeding US$1,200, starting from March 1, 1946. Imports of trucks were prohibited from April 29, 1946, and imports of wireless radios and refrigerators were prohibited from November 25, 1946; no foreign exchange settlements were allowed.

(2) Foreign Exchange Settlement Situation of the Central Bank: 1. The amount of foreign exchange sold to general industrial and commercial enterprises and private individuals for legitimate needs, according to the Central Bank's Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Management and the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade, from March 4, 1946, to November 17, 1946, totaled US$381,552,461.13. Subsequently, the revised Measures for Import and Export Trade were promulgated, imposing stricter restrictions on imports. By February 1, 1947, a total of US$2,012,040.80 had been sold. It can be seen that the sales volume decreased significantly after the promulgation of the revised Measures for Import and Export Trade. 2. The amount of foreign exchange sold to Fuzhong, Yangtze, and other companies: A. Fuzhong Company settled a total of US$153,778,723 in foreign exchange. Excluding the company's own and sold foreign exchange, the net purchase was US$111,330,731 (as it appears in the original Central Daily News). The purchased goods were mainly jeeps and station wagons, accounting for 50% of the total, and wireless radios and accessories accounted for 20%. The rest were permitted imports. B. Yangtze Company settled a total of US$180,691,069 in foreign exchange. Excluding the company's own and sold foreign exchange, the net purchase was US$1,074,200. The purchased goods were mainly cotton products. C. China Construction Bank Company settled a total of US$87,762 in foreign exchange.

(3) Actual Import Situation of Fuzhong and Other Companies: (1) Fuzhong Company purchased two "Cadillac" cars with factory prices exceeding the regulations. It also purchased 101 station wagons, but all had permits allowing import. As for 780 jeeps, 738 have already been imported. If classified as light trucks according to the rules, imports should be suspended. According to customs reports, 189 jeeps were shipped before the ban, and the purchase price for 549 jeeps was paid before the ban. According to the government's orders, they should be allowed to be imported. However, a review of the company's foreign exchange settlement accounts shows that, except for 200 vehicles ordered before the ban, the purchase price for the rest was paid after the ban, which is inconsistent with the customs reports. In addition, the company purchased 108 boxes of wireless radio equipment, including 40 radios, which were imported with permits after the issuance of the restriction order. 2. Yangtze Company purchased 50 Austin cars with factory prices not exceeding the regulations. However, three wireless radios purchased were imported with permits after the issuance of the restriction order. In addition, 128 boxes of cosmetics purchased were returned after customs inspection. 3. China Construction Bank Company purchased 56 cars, but none exceeded the regulations. As for the rumors that Song Zi'an, the general manager of Fuzhong Company, and Shen Chou'nian, the assistant manager, used diplomatic passports to conduct business in the United States in 1941 and 1942, it is currently impossible to investigate.

### Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Suffered Atrocities; Our Government Issued a Solemn Statement; Urging Both Combatant Parties to Pay Attention to the Responsibility for Harmful Actions; The Executive Yuan Allocated Huge Sums to Relieve Overseas Chinese

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Ye Gongchao, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, issued the following statement on the situation in the Dutch East Indies on the 29th:

Since the Dutch government took military action in some areas of the Dutch East Indies, resulting in renewed armed conflict between the Dutch military and Indonesians, the Chinese residents in the area have become victims of the Indonesians' scorched-earth policy, suffering significant losses of life and property. Indonesian troops have repeatedly carried out acts of arson and atrocities against innocent overseas Chinese, violating international law and humanitarianism. The Chinese government considers this extremely serious. We can still recall that before the Linggadjati Agreement was signed, Chinese residents in the Dutch East Indies had already suffered incalculable losses of life and property due to armed conflict between the two sides. Although the Chinese residents in the Dutch East Indies have had close ties to the local development and prosperity for more than 300 years, and although they have strictly maintained neutrality in accordance with the instructions of the Chinese government during the conflict, such incidents still occurred. Now that the war has broken out again, the Chinese residents in Indonesia are suffering even greater harm. I must urge the Indonesian authorities to consider the serious consequences of the unlawful acts of their troops and strictly order them not to take such actions against defenseless neutral Chinese residents again. At the same time, we must also urge the Dutch government to fulfill its moral and legal responsibility to protect the lives and property of Chinese residents throughout the Dutch East Indies.

[Another Dispatch] According to diplomatic sources: In Kuala Town, western Maimang, a conflict area in the Dutch East Indies, overseas Chinese were previously besieged and in a critical situation. Currently, 700 refugees in the area have been rescued by Dutch troops. The Chinese Consulate in Medan is making every effort to provide relief and raise funds to prevent them from becoming displaced.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Amid the conflict in the Dutch East Indies, many of our overseas Chinese compatriots have been persecuted, killed, and displaced due to the war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially requested the Executive Yuan to allocate special funds for the relief of overseas Chinese. This case was approved at the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the morning of the 29th, and 1 million Dutch guilders will be allocated directly to Chiang Chia-tung, our Consul General in Batavia, for distribution in various regions.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Batavia, 29th] After investigating the situation in Salatiga, south of Semarang, where our overseas Chinese residents were abducted by Indonesian troops, our delegation has returned from the area. A small number of overseas Chinese managed to escape, and their residences have all been burned and looted.

[Another Dispatch] The Indonesian government recently issued a statement requesting overseas Chinese residents residing in the territory of the Republic of Indonesia who have suffered war damage to report the amount and type of losses to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### National Army in Linqu Achieved a Great Victory; After a Fierce Battle of Six Days and Nights, 40,000 Bandits Were Annihilated; The Chairman Issued an Order Commending and Allocating Funds for慰劳

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jinan, 29th] The battle for Linqu City has lasted for six days and nights. Led by General Li, the National Army defending the city, with a very small number of troops, resisted fifteen times the number of Communist bandits. The ferocity of the battle was truly earth-shattering and tear-jerking. On the 28th and 29th, the front line was under great pressure, but the loyal and brave air force still reinforced the tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians in the city despite the harsh weather. Although the war has become increasingly urgent since the 28th, the soldiers and civilians defending the city still stood firm in their positions and resisted strongly. On the night of the 28th, the Communist bandits mobilized the main force of seven columns, about 150,000 men, and launched a general offensive on the city and Qushan to the east of the city. After a fierce battle all night, the bandits who broke in through the east and south gates and the bandits who attacked Qushan were all repelled. However, the north and south passes were still under fierce contention.

[Another Dispatch] In the battle of Linqu, Regiment Commander Shi Jianzhong continued fighting despite sustaining three injuries. Battalion Commander Hou Xijin and Battalion Commander Zhou Yukuan also continued fighting despite being injured, firmly defending their positions. Chairman Chiang specially issued an order to commend them. In addition to submitting the meritorious deeds of the brave soldiers such as Regiment Commander Shi to the Ministry of National Defense for commendation, he also issued 300 million national currency in advance to the wounded and killed officers and soldiers defending the city, to be distributed by General Li Mi. The funds have been remitted to Wang Wu.

[Urgent Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Qingdao, 29th] The Li Mi Division of Xia Chuzhong's troops, which has been firmly defending Linqu City, has been attacked by Communist bandits from all sides for six days and nights. Most of the Communist bandits who broke into the city have been annihilated. Currently, there are only over a thousand bandit troops outside the north gate, who are being surrounded and annihilated. Over the past four days, more than 40,000 Communist bandits have been annihilated by the National Army.

### Affected by the Closure of Restaurants by the Japanese, 20,000 Overseas Chinese Changed Professions; The Mission in Japan is Doing Its Best to Provide Assistance

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our mission in Japan is currently doing its best to assist the approximately 20,000 overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs due to the Japanese order to close restaurants, so that they can change to other professions. With the assistance of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our mission, the Overseas Chinese Restaurant Industry Association has established a significant organization to provide guidance on the issue of changing professions. According to Lin Dingping, the director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our mission, the progress of the large-scale change of professions for overseas Chinese who were originally engaged in the restaurant industry but are now unemployed is satisfactory. After the Japanese government announced the order to close restaurants, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of our mission did its best to consult with the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese government, arguing that the restaurants run by overseas Chinese mostly sell refined foods, rather than what the Japanese regularly need, so they should still be allowed to operate. However, the Allied Headquarters believed that there should be no exceptions to this law to avoid the adverse consequences of creating a black market for food, so they ultimately did not agree with the opinion of our Overseas Chinese Affairs Office.

### Various Newspapers in Hengyang Demand Paper Allocation; Sending Representatives to Petition in the Capital

[Hengyang Aviation News] The Hengyang Newspaper Association believes that Hengyang has suffered severely from war, followed by famine, economic depression, and difficult recovery. The Hengyang press has overcome difficulties, and as many as twelve newspapers have been published after the restoration. Later, due to soaring exchange rates and a lack of newsprint, a small number of newspapers have been forced to close. Currently, there are only four remaining daily newspapers, namely, the Zhonghua Shibao, Li Bao, Shimin Bao, and Datong Bao, and three evening newspapers, namely, the Jian Bao, Jingcheng Bao, and Dahua Bao. Recently, customs adjusted the tax rate on newsprint, which is almost equivalent to restricting the import of goods from Hong Kong. It has been found that all newspapers in the southwest region have paper allocations, but Hengyang does not. In order to ensure their own survival, a commemorative meeting was held last week to elect Li Yunpeng, president of the Zhonghua Shibao, as the representative to petition in the capital. He will appeal to the relevant authorities in Beijing and Shanghai to make reasonable efforts to provide news to the cities commemorating the War of Resistance.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Taipei, 29th] The Taiwan Provincial War Criminal Military Tribunal today sentenced five people, including Shih Chen-fu of Taiwan, who were accused of jointly plotting internal rebellion.

Hsu Ping and Lin Hsiung-hsiang are each sentenced to one year and ten months of imprisonment for jointly plotting to seize territory. Chien Chi-shan and Hsu Kun-chuan are acquitted." (Note: After Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced the unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945, Staff Officer Major Nakamiya Goro of the Japanese Army Command in Taiwan was unwilling to surrender and conspired to seize the territory under the false name of autonomy. After our national military and political personnel took over Taiwan, the Japanese ringleader Nakamiya and others fled without a trace. The defendants Koo Chen-fu and the other four were charged with the crime of jointly plotting internal rebellion.)

### Editorial: Reforming the Monetary System and Stabilizing Currency Values

The issue of reforming the monetary system has recently garnered considerable attention from all quarters, with the key focus being on the timing: Should reform commence immediately, or should it wait until a more opportune moment? In other words, there is no question about the major premise of the need for reform; the only question is what is the most appropriate time to do so.

Originally, our country's inflation has evolved to its current state. Compared to the German mark after World War I and the Hungarian pengő after World War II, the degree is still considered much better. However, today's wholesale index is more than 40,000 times higher than before the war, and the trend of continued growth is still present. This has led to a sharp decline in savings, rampant speculation, shrinking production, and commercial stagnation, plunging both public and private economies into extremely difficult straits. To turn a blind eye and let it drag on indefinitely would be tantamount to doing nothing and awaiting total economic collapse, which is certainly not what most people want to see.

As for the timing of the reform, although it is worth careful consideration, we believe that the goal of implementing the reform must be firmly grasped as a standard for determining when to reform. What is this goal? It is to stabilize currency values. It should be understood that the reason everyone advocates reform now is not because they harbor any deep hatred for the current legal tender itself. It is simply that they feel that its value is too fluid and too low, and that its function has been lost too much.

If the value of the legal tender can be immediately stabilized and its original function as currency restored, then whether it is rectified, reformed, or a new currency is issued, or even if the current legal tender is continued, it is still negotiable. In other words, if, after rectification or reform, the currency value remains unstable, and prices, livelihoods, finance, economics, and so on remain unstable, then the future new currency will still be no different from the current legal tender. After a change, it will only increase public disturbance and losses. If that is the case, it will not only be useless, but also harmful.

Therefore, we believe that the most pressing issue at present is not the future currency itself: Should we manage the currency? Or should we adopt hard currency? The gold standard? Or the silver standard? The real question need not be considered solely in terms of time. Instead, we should carefully consider what methods and conditions are needed to stabilize currency values. We must know that rectifying or reforming the monetary system is an important means of stabilizing currency values, but rectification and reform do not necessarily stabilize currency values. If done improperly, or if the conditions are not met, the opposite effect may occur.

So, what conditions are necessary to stabilize currency values? As we all know, all currencies have both internal and external values. When foreign exchange funds are lacking, causing an imbalance in international payments, its external value—foreign exchange—will be shaken, or even stagnated. Because of financial reasons, when the amount of currency issued is too large, and there is actually no need for it, its internal value—prices—will also be shaken, affecting prices, interest rates, wages, savings, and the overall public and private life. Therefore, to stabilize its external value, we must first replenish its foreign exchange and eliminate its imbalance. To stabilize its internal value, we must first consolidate our finances and stop the continued expansion of the currency. These are the basic conditions for stabilizing currency values, which cannot be circumvented or manipulated.

If the above premise is correct, then we can research the timing issue. That is, how can foreign exchange funds be replenished? To solve this problem, there are only two ways: to address the root cause and to treat the symptoms. Measures such as increasing production, developing exports, and absorbing overseas remittances are all ways to address the root cause. However, these all require accumulating achievements over time and gradually increasing, which cannot be achieved overnight in a short period. That is to say, no one can accurately predict when this period will arrive in our country's current situation.

The second is to treat the symptoms, that is, to borrow from abroad. If this foreign debt can be fully utilized and someone is willing to lend it, then the time when the foreign debt is established is the time when the external value of the currency can be stabilized. Some estimate that the total amount of currency currently issued, converted to pre-war value, is only over 300 million US dollars. Therefore, if a loan of 500 million US dollars can be successfully negotiated, and the other party is willing to allocate it to foreign exchange funds first, regardless of production equipment, transportation equipment, and other construction purposes, then the so-called rectification or reform of the monetary system should not be difficult to start at that time. But is this possible in reality? And when can it be realized? No one can accurately predict.

As for making up for the deficit in public finances, the government has proposed various measures, such as streamlining tax collection, eliminating embezzlement, selling off enemy and puppet surplus assets, selling state-owned enterprises, selling Japanese reparations, and reducing unnecessary projects, and eliminating redundant agencies. If implemented decisively and effectively, it will be of some benefit to the country's finances. But when can it be done comprehensively? And is the income enough to make up for the needs of total mobilization, demobilization, and various constructions? There is still no concrete explanation. In that case, the timing of the cessation of currency inflation and the stabilization of the internal value of legal tender are still questionable.

Therefore, discussing the timing of rectifying or reforming the monetary system today seems premature. The government has repeatedly stated that currency reform will have to wait until an appropriate time. This is likely due to the complexity of the issues and the fact that all the various conditions are not easily met at one time. We demand currency stability, and even economic stability, but the only way to achieve this is to suppress internal turmoil, balance income and expenditure, and, on the one hand, step up production and strengthen national strength. This is probably the only way to do our best at present.

### Outer Mongolia and the United Nations

The United Nations Security Council Membership Review Committee held a meeting at Lake Success the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations. Our country's representative, Dr. Xu Shuxi, stated on the spot that China firmly opposes the application of a neighboring country that has invaded our Xinjiang Province by force to join the United Nations and will exercise its veto power in the Security Council. This solemn statement will be unanimously supported by our country's government and the public.

The United Nations organization was born in the suffering period of the war, created a beautiful vision for mankind, and expressed a kind of awareness of mankind, that is, everyone believes that mankind can only achieve progress if they maintain world peace in international cooperation. The United Nations organization is an international organization that promotes international cooperation, understanding, peace, progress, and prosperity. But since its establishment, it has been more than two years, and people mostly feel that the achievements of the United Nations organization are slim. In these two years, many disputes have occurred internationally, and they have been submitted to the United Nations for handling, but none have been effectively resolved. Therefore, whether the United Nations organization can avoid repeating the mistakes of the old League of Nations is still a question to be examined.

If Outer Mongolia asks to join the United Nations because it cherishes lofty ideals, hopes for international cooperation, and promotes the realization of world peace, it should be welcomed by any country, especially China. However, Outer Mongolia has not only failed to express its sincere love of peace, but has instead invaded our Xinjiang Province with force, disrupting peace. The addition of this kind of country to the United Nations will not only fail to increase the status of the United Nations, but will also be enough to satirize the existence of the United Nations. Therefore, China's opposition to Outer Mongolia joining the United Nations is not entirely out of selfish motives, but for the sake of the future of the United Nations.

If we hope that the United Nations organization can become a truly effective international organization for maintaining world peace, then we must strictly limit the countries applying to join the United Nations and must not allow aggressive countries to mix among them. Although the Soviet representative argued for Outer Mongolia, the Baitashan incident cannot be denied. The Soviet representative cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the world with one hand!

### Fake Money Ring Cracked in Zhaihai Ning County, Zhejiang Province, 2.4 Billion Fake Bills Seized

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 29th Dispatch] The Zhejiang Security Command cracked a large-scale counterfeit money-making organization at the Xu residence, Wangdian Portnan, Jiajia Du, Er Gonglu, Changhang Ninghai County at 10:00 AM on the 26th, and seized 2.4 billion fake five thousand yuan banknotes, a printing press, three fast and slow machines, and seven male criminals including Zhang Baorong (Cao Hongshou is the local Bao Chief) and one female criminal, Wang Jia's family, and the main culprit is at large. According to the Zhejiang Security Spokesperson: According to the confession, they started printing 2,500 yuan fake banknotes of the Central Bank of Sa's printed by the South China Printing Company in August last year. They used white and beige Daolin paper. The portrait of the National Father on the front, the seal, and the signature on the back are all relatively blurred, but they can be confused with the real thing. The total number has reached tens of billions. The sales locations are as far as the Northwest. Dozens of boxes of fake banknotes are shipped to Shanghai by ship every month and resold to various places. Those who buy and sell in cash exchange 4 million for 10 million fake banknotes. If there is a wealthy teacher or guarantor, they can hang on credit and exchange 3 million for 10 million. It is heard that this organization was secretly established before the war. The one cracked in a hotel in Shanghai earlier was only the sales office of this organization. Many local residents are also related to this organization. The security team disguised themselves as watermelon merchants and investigated several times before they were arrested. The main culprit has not been found yet and is currently under interrogation.

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco 29th Broadcast: Indonesian radio announced that the Indonesian Air Force made its first sortie today, bombing two cities occupied by Dutch troops in Java. Indonesian troops shot down two Dutch fighter planes east of Mentokop, Java. A Dutch submarine shelled Labuhan City, located on the coast of Java.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success 28th Dispatch] As of this morning, the Indonesian delegation has not received instructions to bring the Indonesian issue to the United Nations Security Council.

[Agence France-Presse, London 28th Dispatch] Those in charge here recently stated that Britain will set up to dissuade the United Nations Security Council from interfering in the Indonesian conflict. Experts on Far Eastern issues have held meetings to draft the instructions that Foreign Minister Bevin should give to General Sir Cadogan, the British representative to the Security Council. It is heard that Sir Cadogan will try to give the representatives of the Security Council the impression that the Indonesian issue is a Dutch internal affair. The reason why Britain has adopted this attitude is probably because it hopes that the Netherlands and Indonesia will accept the mediation proposals of Britain and the United States. In addition, British officials were quite surprised to hear the news that India had decided to submit the Indonesian issue to the United Nations. This was especially true because the British Party hoped that Indonesia and the Netherlands would eventually accept the mediation of Britain and the United States, so they were even more surprised.

[United Press, Yogyakarta 29th Dispatch] The Indonesian military issued a special communique at midnight stating that the Indonesian Air Force bombed three Dutch offensive starting points, Sampo and Latika in the morning, about 60 air miles north of Yogyakarta. (According to a previous estimate by authoritative sources, the strength of the Indonesian Air Force is about 40 aircraft. According to the Dutch side, ten of them have been destroyed.)

[Reuters, Yogyakarta 28th Dispatch] An Indonesian communiqué stated that fighting is taking place in the alleys of Bandung, and the Republican army has recovered Jibalaraj, twelve miles southeast of Bandung. The Republic announced that 763 Dutch soldiers in western Java had surrendered to Indonesia with their machines. A Dutch communiqué announced that it had occupied the Bandi Asen coal mine in southern Sumatra and the railway works of Laga. The coal mine is the largest mine in the Dutch East Indies, and the factory is used by the Republic to manufacture rifles and light machine guns. The Dutch headquarters estimates that the losses suffered by British and Dutch plantation companies in western Java due to Indonesia's scorched earth policy reached 2 million pounds.

[Taiwan Public News Agency, Batavia 29th Dispatch] At Buntup, 100 miles from Liria Port in Sumatra, four oil pools of the Mobil Oil Company caught fire. The Indonesian communiqué stated that the responsibility for the fire lies not with Indonesia, but with the Netherlands.

### Indonesian-Dutch Relations Turn Delicate, Dutch Side Expresses Welcome to Shari to Visit the Netherlands

[Reuters, London 29th Dispatch] The Dutch News Agency said that the Dutch military operations in Java are expected to end within a week, and said that the Dutch Ambassador to India, Lamping, departed from The Hague for New Delhi on Friday, and may contact former Indonesian Prime Minister Shari, who is now there (see picture). According to a spokesperson for the Dutch Overseas Colonies Department, if Shari is willing to come to the Netherlands, the Netherlands will express its welcome.

[Reuters, The Hague 29th Dispatch] An official Dutch spokesperson denied rumors that Java and Sumatra would be divided into seven parts, saying that the Dutch government would not draft any plans until it had completed its police operations in Indonesia. The Dutch spokesperson denied that the Dutch government intended to change the Linditti Agreement. He expressed his belief that the police operation would hopefully end soon, and after it ended, he would seek to resume contact with Indonesia. At the same time, some socialists have requested the Socialist Executive Committee to convene a special meeting to have former Indonesian Prime Minister Shari attend and express Indonesia's views.

Shari's Talk

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, the eighth] Shari met with reporters from the Central News Agency at Nehru's residence this morning. He said that the current conflict between the Dutch and Indonesia is no longer a domestic affair, but a conflict between independent governments. China, Britain, India, Australia, the United States, and other countries, and even the Netherlands, have in fact recognized the Republic of Indonesia. The Netherlands is now withdrawing its promise to recognize the Republic of Indonesia, but other countries that have recognized the Republic of Indonesia will certainly not be as fickle as the Netherlands. Shari also said that there are more than one million overseas Chinese in Indonesia, and they are the middle class in Indonesia. If a prolonged war occurs in Indonesia, the overseas Chinese will suffer the greatest losses. The reporter then asked, "After being turned down by both sides, what steps should China take to bring peace to Indonesia?" Without hesitation, Shari immediately replied, "The United Nations Security Council should intervene immediately." He also believes that if China, India, Australia, Britain, and the United States, which are directly related to Indonesia, take direct intervention actions, it will be faster and more effective than the Security Council's intervention. If the above-mentioned countries can take concerted action, the results will be even better. Shari said: "If circumstances permit, I would very much like to go to South Zong."

### US Newspapers Sympathize with Indonesian Resistance

British Newspapers Uniquely Support Dutch Position

[Associated Press, New York 29th Dispatch] The New York Herald Tribune said that Americans cannot accept the reasons given by the Netherlands for provoking war in Indonesia. The American people deeply sympathize with the ideal of self-determination of the Asian people. However, sympathy cannot help the facts. The Netherlands will soon regain strong control over Indonesia. The development after this will be a touchstone for the Netherlands. If the Netherlands can put down its machine guns and abide by the Linditti Agreement after achieving its so-called goals, it will surely win the praise of the world. However, Europeans often claim to have pure and lofty goals when dealing with colonies. As for their actions, they are often the opposite. The New York Times commented that India's first call to the United Nations for the Indonesian-Dutch war was a shame for the United States and other Western democracies. This move will cause white people to lose their prestige in Asia and deepen the divide between Europe and Asia. The resentful response of Nehru and other Asian leaders to the Indonesian war actually represents Asian cooperation. The era of military control has passed, or at least is about to end.

[Agence France-Presse, London 28th Dispatch] The British Yorkshire Post published an editorial today expressing sympathy for the policies adopted by the Netherlands in Indonesia. The text reads: Since March 24 this year, the Netherlands has taken a conciliatory attitude in every way, but Indonesia has refused to implement the compromise plan established by both parties, resulting in the recurrence of disputes. The extremists in Yogyakarta even forced former Prime Minister Shari to resign, and the new government denied the promises he made to the Netherlands in Batavia.

### Riots Break Out in Northern Myanmar, Large Numbers of Soldiers and Police Rush to Various Areas to Suppress Them

[Reuters, Yangon 28th Dispatch] Riots have broken out in the Tailla Wadi and Hansada districts of northern Myanmar, and army camps have rushed to suppress them. The area was originally a base for opponents of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. This riot may have been instigated by the National Party led by former Prime Minister U Sa, who was arrested. The police recently arrested many people in the area and seized many weapons. At the same time, when the new cabinet of Myanmar held a meeting in Yangon today, a 10-foot-high barrier was set up outside, and the guards were closely guarded. Myanmar's first ambassador to the United States will go to the United States next month to take office.

[Associated Press, Washington 29th Dispatch] The US government recently notified the Myanmar government that the United States accepts U So Nyun as the first ambassador of Myanmar to the United States. U will go to the United States around August to take office.

### Indian Army Begins Distribution

[Reuters, New Delhi 29th Dispatch] A communique from the headquarters of the Indian Army announced that the Indian Army units assigned to the two autonomous states of Pakistan and India, including infantry, armored units, artillery, and engineering teams, have begun to move into new barracks. The first phase of transportation will require more than 150 special trains.

### Indian Independence Day, People Should Fast and Reflect

Saint Gandhi said after prayer

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi 28th Dispatch] Indian Mahatma Gandhi said after praying today that when the Indian people declare independence on August 15, the people of the whole country should fast, pray, and reflect on the freedom we have obtained, which is not freedom but destruction.

### British Foreign Office Issues Invitation to Convene Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference, Soviet Union First to Respond and Accept Invitation

It is reported that this foreign ministers' conference will allow representatives from Germany and Austria to attend in accordance with the decision of the last foreign ministers' conference.

### The British Economic Crisis Is Increasingly Serious; Attlee's Situation Is Difficult; Both Houses of Parliament Will Soon Hold Debates

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Qualified observers here say that since Prime Minister Attlee lost the support of trade union members in Parliament, the crisis formed by the national economic situation has now taken effect in British politics. Two facts are noteworthy: 1. Last Friday, the General Council of Trade Unions refused to express its approval without discussing the government's economic policy; 2. Labour MPs in Parliament are scheduled to meet on Wednesday, and Prime Minister Attlee has been invited to attend. Currently, the dual opposition facing Prime Minister Attlee is the Labour Party "traitors" and trade union members. It is said that Prime Minister Attlee is currently planning to rely on the mediation of Lord President of the Council Morrison and Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton to bring trade union members back into the government's fold. If this effort fails, then the Labour Party "traitors" and trade union members may actually merge to form an opposition group.

At the same time, the dollar crisis is worsening day by day. The possible measures the government will take to ease the current economic situation are as follows: 1. Reduce food imports; 2. Reduce raw material imports; 3. Save on the economy in the occupied territories. However, many people believe that the first measure will never be supported by the people. Observers continued: Currently, only by demonstrating the "Dunkirk spirit," led by a national coalition government or a universally recognized leader, can the Labour cabinet be put into practice. In this regard, Foreign Secretary Bevin is the most popular. Labour figures also believe that he is the most suitable person. However, if one wants to immediately replace the Prime Minister through a vote of no confidence, neither the British Parliament nor the Labour Party has such a custom.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Prime Minister Attlee convened some cabinet members tonight, most of whom were economic experts, to hold a meeting. According to well-informed sources, the purpose of this meeting was to draft the speech that the Prime Minister will deliver to the Labour Party Congress on the 30th. Therefore, Minister Greenwood, Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, Lord President of the Council Morrison, and President of the Board of Trade Cripps all attended the meeting and discussed the following four issues: 1. The shortage of dollars; 2. The problem of increasing coal production; 3. Foreign trade issues; 4. The problem of labor shortage.

[British News Agency, London, 29th] Before the summer recess of Parliament, both Houses of Parliament will debate the most important issues regarding the economic situation and the future of Britain. The debate in the House of Lords will be initiated by the Liberal Party, and the debate in the House of Commons will be presided over by the Conservative Party with the consent of the Liberal Party. These debates may begin on August 4. Members of all parties are quite anxious, saying that before the parliamentary recess, the government's various economic difficulties should be clearly explained, and the government's own views on the implementation methods should be clarified.

### President Truman Flew Back to Washington Yesterday

Mrs. Truman's Funeral Was Extremely Simple

[United Press, Grandview, 28th] On the afternoon of July 28th, under the scorching sun, Mrs. Truman's remains were buried at the Forest Hill Cemetery in a simple ceremony. The ceremony lasted only 20 minutes, with no eulogies or elegies. Immediately after the ceremony, it was announced that President Truman would fly back to Washington on the 29th.

### Three Jewish Terrorists Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Strict Martial Law in the Holy Land

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 29th] Three Jews, Haim Haviv Weis, and Nakara, who attacked Acre Prison on May 4th and were sentenced to death by a military court on June 16th, were hanged in Acre Prison at dawn today. Their bodies have been transported to Safed in northern Palestine and buried in the same place as the four Jewish terrorists, Groner, etc., who were hanged on April 16th. The authorities notified the families of the three convicts last night, instructing them to go to Safed to wait for the arrival of the bodies. At the same time, it is expected that the entire territory of Palestine will be placed under stricter martial law, because the commander-in-chief of the Jewish terrorist Irgun Party, Begin, has already announced that he will hang two British sergeants detained by him at the same time as the three were hanged, in retaliation.

### Jewish Refugees Arrive in France; Refuse to Disembark

[Associated Press, Paris, 29th] Four thousand five hundred Jewish refugees, escorted by three British transport ships, arrived here this morning. They refused to disembark because they could not enter Palestine, expressing their protest.

### Outer Mongolia Applies to Join the United Nations; Our Country Declares Withdrawal of Support; Invasion of Our Territory Clearly Shows It Is Not a Peace-Loving Country

[United Press, Lake Success, 28th] When Soviet representative Krasilnikov supported Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations in the Credentials Committee of the Security Council today, he believed that China's claim that Outer Mongolian troops invaded the Peita Mountain area of China was "fabricated" and its purpose was to divert attention from the situation in China. Krasilnikov said that this was based on Outer Mongolia's official gazette in response to China's statement. Krasilnikov continued that Outer Mongolian air force only appeared when a regiment of the Chinese army refused to withdraw from the border area and then only to escort them out. Chinese representative Xu Shuxi said that Outer Mongolian and Soviet troops attempted to occupy Peita Mountain in Xinjiang Province two months ago, engaging in "armed aggression," which was not the behavior of a peace-loving country. Therefore, China cannot approve Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations. Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States on the committee are now expressing doubts about Outer Mongolia's sovereignty. American representative Renault said that Outer Mongolia is currently only recognized by China and the Soviet Union, and only has diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Renault said that he would like to hear the Chinese representative's response to Krasilnikov's remarks before making a decision. The committee has now postponed a final decision until the Chinese representative responds to this matter on the 30th.

Full Text of Our Representative's Speech

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 28th] Chinese representative Xu Shuxi delivered a speech at the Credentials Committee of the Security Council this morning. The full text is as follows: "Gentlemen who were members of this committee last year should recall that when this committee discussed the application of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the United Nations last year, the Chinese delegation suggested proceeding with caution. However, when the matter was discussed in the Security Council later, it voted in favor of its admission. As of last summer, the applicant country had been established for a year, but only maintained active relations with one country, and only promised to exchange envoys with one country. As a result, the world does not know whether it is peace-loving or willing to implement the various obligations stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations. Even the country to which it belonged for thousands of years and which celebrated its independence did not know the details. China still maintains that membership in the United Nations should be universal and has even approved the application for obvious independence. At the same time, in general, it expresses sympathy for all nations striving for freedom and independence. Due to the above-mentioned broader reasons, China changed its original intention in the final review stage and cancelled its opposition. However, the applicant country is so mysterious that some delegations have not been prepared to take risks with China. As a result, the Security Council did not recommend allowing Outer Mongolia to be a member of the United Nations.

Time flies, a year has passed. China, along with many other countries, unanimously hopes that the doubts held by our delegation are not true, and that the United Nations can safely vote to allow the applicant country to join the United Nations. However, what is the result of China's expectations? The armed forces of the applicant country invaded Xinjiang Province, attempting to seize the Peita Mountain area. This invasion occurred in recent months and has not yet ended. The excuse is that Peita Mountain is the territory of the applicant country and not the territory of China. However, according to the facts, the area is located within Xinjiang Province as recorded in the boundary record of both parties, which is very clear and reliable. This boundary was demarcated more than 30 years ago when the autonomous region of Outer Mongolia was established. Until the day of Outer Mongolia's invasion, no one disputed it, even when Outer Mongolia became the Mongolian People's Republic. The area has been governed by China for many years and defended by Chinese troops, which, although not sufficient to repel the full-scale invasion with all modern weapons, as we have seen and are still seeing, including aircraft operations, can maintain law and order. In theory, even if the applicant country has ownership of the Peita Mountain area, it should not take methods akin to war to achieve its goals.

The applicant country has never tried to negotiate with China, nor has it taken mediation and reconciliation, suggested investigation, or resorted to arbitration and legal solutions. The first action it took was aggression, and it sent the "beautiful ultimatum" of a 48-hour deadline to the local authorities. The Chinese government protested and demanded that military operations be stopped and the invaded area be withdrawn pending investigation. The applicant country replied that the area belonged to it. Mr. Chairman, the Mongolian People's Republic has taken actions contrary to the obligations stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations that it promised to accept when it applied to join the United Nations. Once this delegation joins the United Nations, it will not be able or willing to fulfill these obligations. This country has failed to demonstrate that it is a peace-loving country. The Chinese delegation only suspected the qualifications of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the United Nations in the past, but today it believes that it is not qualified to join the United Nations. Therefore, China cannot give it the support it gave it here in the past.

### The Breakdown of British-Soviet Trade Negotiations; British Minister of Commerce Submits Report; Failure to Resolve Financial Issues is the Main Reason for Failure

[Reuters, London, 28th] Minister of Commerce Sir Cripps reported in the House of Commons that the breakdown of British-Soviet trade negotiations was due to the failure to reach an agreement on the terms of the Soviet Union's repayment of the loan it borrowed from Britain in 1941. Difficulties arising from the high price of wheat had been resolved by the end of the negotiations. All issues related to the trade part, including quantity, price, and transportation, had been agreed upon before the financial issues concerning the repayment of the loan reached an impasse. A contract for the purchase of timber had been signed, and a contract for the purchase of quantities of grain was also ready to be signed. The quantity of various mechanical equipment ordered by the Soviet Union from Britain had been agreed upon, and the procedures for the Soviet procurement delegation to come to Britain to sign contracts had also been discussed. The Soviet Union was indeed willing to supply Britain with large quantities of grain in the next four years, first supplying Britain with one million tons of newly harvested grain in 1947.

Since agreements had been reached on trade matters, unfortunately, the financial issues reached an impasse. Britain had agreed to reduce the interest rate on the 1941 loan by five thousandths, give up the requirement to pay 40 percent of the purchase price in cash, and had made concessions to approach the Soviet Union's request to extend the repayment of all loans. However, Britain could not accept all of the Soviet Union's requirements as conditions for entering into a trade agreement. In fact, except for the two points concerning interest rates and cash payments, all of the Soviet Union's requirements had been accepted. On the point of extending the repayment period, Britain had also accepted 60 percent of the Soviet Union's requirements. The steps taken by Britain would cause it to suffer significant losses in the next four years. Due to its own financial difficulties, Britain was unable to accept what the Soviet Union claimed to be the minimum requirements. However, the British government still hopes that this is only a temporary disappointment and deeply hopes that British-Soviet trade will be greatly expanded. The Soviet government also gave this assurance when the British Minister of Foreign Trade negotiated in Moscow.

### Internal Strife in the Greek Government

Minister of Public Order Slams Table and Resigns

[Associated Press, Athens, 28th] Greek Minister of Public Order Tsioufas angrily left the cabinet meeting on the 28th after a cabinet discussion on whether to criticize the government's combat methods against guerrilla forces. Tsioufas's action is tantamount to resignation. He slammed the table and left. As things stand, he has no place in the government. Tsioufas had a conflict of opinion with the General Staff regarding the guerrilla forces' invasion of Greek territory from Albania. He recently publicly criticized the tactics of the government forces, which made the situation even more incompatible.

### Norwegian Ship Loaded with Nitrates Explodes; Major Fire in the Port of Brest, France; 20 Dead and Over a Thousand Injured

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] The Norwegian ship "Ocean Liberty," loaded with nitrates, caught fire and exploded at the port of Brest, France, at 2:00 PM today. Twenty people were killed and 250 injured. The commercial district of Brest is on fire. The "Ocean Liberty" came from New York, carrying 2,500 tons of ammonium nitrate.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] After the explosion of a Norwegian ship in the port of Brest, the city is ablaze tonight. It has been confirmed that 20 people have died and 1,100 have been injured, including 100 seriously injured. It is widely believed to be the biggest tragedy in France during peacetime. By late tonight, the fire in the commercial district of Brest had been brought under control and was about to be extinguished. However, many residents, fearing further explosions, flocked out of the city. The estimated loss is 100 million francs. According to the crew of the Norwegian ship, at 12:30 PM, thick smoke billowed from the ship's third cargo hold. Workers and crew members cooperated to put out the fire, but it was not easy to extinguish for a while due to the thick smoke. Then the first explosion was heard, and the warehouse of the Chamber of Commerce on the pier was set on fire. When they left the ship, they saw a French gunboat firing at the ship. Although seawater poured in through the gun holes, the fire did not abate slightly and had already spread to the entire ship. At about 5:30 PM, a second explosion occurred, which was louder than the first. Many doors, windows, and furniture in the houses near the port were destroyed by the shock. The fire quickly spread to the commercial district, and a nearby gas station was also burned. It is reported that the captain of the Norwegian ship has died. The gasoline depot and gas plant on the dock were still burning at midnight. Most of the injured were severely injured by glass shards, etc.

### The Soviet Representative on the Allied Council for Japan Quietly Returns Home; It is rumored to be discussing the issue of a peace treaty with Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] Lieutenant General Derevyanko, the Soviet representative on the Allied Council for Japan, quietly left Tokyo for Moscow on the 29th, for an unknown mission. According to the Soviet Embassy here, it is unknown when Derevyanko will return to Japan. Derevyanko's spokesperson also refused to disclose the nature of the trip. It is believed that Derevyanko was summoned back to discuss the proposed peace treaty with Japan. Derevyanko's secretary said that Derevyanko took a Soviet plane back to the country at Haneda Airport, accompanied by one staff member. The Soviet Embassy said that during Derevyanko's absence, the Soviet side's duties on the committee would be represented by Major General Kislenko, whose position is second only to Derevyanko. At the same time, American representative Acheson, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, will also return to Washington in early August for consultations.

### The Japanese Government Denies that a Temporary Exchange Rate Will Be Set

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The Japanese Board of Trade firmly denied this afternoon the news carried by Jiji Press that "well-informed sources in the trade community" believe that a "temporary rate" may be set between the Japanese yen and the US dollar. A senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters that senior government officials have not even considered the so-called temporary exchange rate.

### British Labour MP Questions the Reason for the Delay in the Trial of Tojo, etc.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] At the meeting of the British House of Commons today, Labour MP Reid raised the question: Why has the Tokyo International Military Tribunal adjourned the trial of Tojo and other accused Japanese leaders? Why does the Soviet government refuse to allow the International Military Tribunal to try some Japanese generals? Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Hector McNeil replied that the Tokyo International Military Tribunal has suspended its session from August 23 to August 4 in order to allow the defendants to prepare and shorten their cases. Although the Japanese prisoners of war detained by the Soviet authorities have not yet been handed over after the International Military Tribunal requested their trial, as far as I know, the Soviet Union has not really refused.

### A British Parliamentary Delegation is Scheduled to Visit Japan in Mid-September

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Hector McNeil replied to a question from a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons today, saying that a British parliamentary delegation will visit Japan in September and is expected to stay for about ten days. The number of representatives will be four or five.

### South Korea Establishes the Korean Gold Bank

And Stipulates the Types of Imports and Exports

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 29th] The Minister of Commerce told reporters today that the resumption of foreign trade was originally scheduled to begin last August, but the resumption date was delayed due to the lack of a foreign exchange bank. The Korean Gold Bank has now been established to prepare to implement the financing of foreign trade. There is a proposal to trade with national countries, but this affects the general economy, so it still needs to be considered closely. Also, in June of this year, the Provisional Government stipulated that foreign trade would officially begin on July 25. Trade with Macau began in April this year, importing essential goods to Korea and exporting red ginseng. At the same time, red ginseng is also exported to Hong Kong. Trade with China also began in mid-June.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 29th] The Export Goods Price Review Committee will stipulate the prices of export goods based on the principle of not harming the Korean economy. The main materials for import and export are divided into two categories: encouraged and prohibited, as follows: Encouraged imports: rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, hides and their products, oils and fats, medicinal materials, tin, electric lights, fertilizers. Prohibited imports: seafood, rapeseed, coral, sea cucumbers, cosmetics. Encouraged exports: seafood, fur, ginseng, raw silk, pottery. Prohibited exports: domestic livestock, game animals, sesame oil, dyes.

### International Trade Conference

### The Head of the Allied General's Foreign Trade Group Says Japan Will Receive a New Cotton Loan from the United States; The Terms of the Loan are More Favorable Than Before

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] According to McDermott, if Japan obtains a new cotton loan from the United States, the terms will be more favorable than the last loan. McDermott is the head of the Allied General Headquarters Foreign Trade Group. Since the arrival of eight people from the US cotton trade in Japan on July 20, he has been in constant contact with them. He hopes to be able to confirm and announce the establishment of the new cotton loan within this week. For six months, the Allied General Headquarters has been carefully considering the hope of revitalizing the Japanese textile industry, and the textile industry accounts for 70 percent of Japan's total export plan.

### Japan Plans to Revise Its Export Policies and Re-determine Its Import and Export Trade Plans

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The Japanese government has been studying countermeasures to promote exports and will formally decide on them soon. However, since export industries must adopt the re-processing of imported raw materials, the biggest problem in the countermeasures to promote exports is to establish a processing trade pattern. The specific countermeasures are based on the processing factory system and adopt the following price and financial countermeasures: Establishment of a processing factory system: In order to ensure the production of export products regarding fiber products and other major sectors, designate processing factories and prioritize the allocation of imported raw materials; also, the import plan for raw materials for export products should be planned separately from general materials to prevent the raw materials for export products from flowing into other industries. Price Countermeasures: Although the purchase price of export products is in principle based on the controlled price, this cannot be expected to improve the quality of trade. Therefore, the Price and Trade Bureau should organize an Export Products Price Review Committee to determine the price. Financial Countermeasures: In order to provide funds to trade-related businesses, create a promissory note system to provide transportation funds.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] According to officials of the Board of Trade, the Japanese government plans to import 61,190,361,000 yen in 1948 (from July this year to June next year). This plan must be approved by the Allied Forces Headquarters before it can take effect. Among the imports, the main ones are food and raw materials. Among them, textile raw materials such as raw cotton and wool require 15,120,135,000 yen. Oil imports require 16,709,188,000 yen. The third most important import is food, which is expected to cost 850 million yen. The remaining funds will be used to purchase rubber, coal, and fertilizer. Japan's exports are mainly metal products and the number of parts and components imported is 8.7 billion yen more than the number of exports. The original plan of Japanese trade was to make exports greater than imports, but due to insufficient export capacity, a new plan was re-determined.

[Reuters, London, 28th] Under-Secretary of State Hector McNeil told Members of Parliament that since the end of March this year, more than 10,000 British troops stationed in Greece have withdrawn, and there are still about 5,000 troops in Greece, in addition to the personnel of the military mission.

### Preliminary Investigation Report Completed; Related to the Chief Executive Meeting Review; Continued Investigation of the First Shot Issue; Witnesses to be Summoned Today; Military Judge from the Ministry of National Defense Can Arrive Today

[Reported by This Newspaper] The central government sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the bloody case of the police-military conflict. The two who arrived in Shanghai yesterday were Major General Li Chengren, Senior Staff Officer of the Military Police Headquarters, and Major General Wang Zhe, Supervisor of the Police Headquarters. Military Police Commander Zhang Zhen called Commander Xuan long-distance, asking him to handle the matter fully. However, Commander Xuan believed that he had not yet handed over his duties at the police bureau and that it would be unfair to do so. Yesterday, he telegraphed Chairman Jiang for instructions again. It is said that Chairman Jiang has decided to order the Ministry of National Defense to send a military judge to Shanghai, who may arrive today.

According to a report from Nanjing on the 29th of this newspaper, after receiving Commander Yi's report on the incident, the Ministry of National Defense Inspection Bureau ordered the resident Shanghai inspectors to investigate the incident at the Jindu Theater in Shanghai.

After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Military Police Headquarters Senior Staff Officer Li Chengren and Police Headquarters Supervisor Wang Zhe listened to reports from the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police and the Police Bureau, respectively, and went to the scene of the incident to investigate. At 4:00 PM, they went to the Garrison Headquarters and met with Tao Yishan, Director of the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters, Wu Guangyun, Commander of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, Zhang Shi, Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, Xu Shigao, Section Chief of the Military Law Department, and others, a total of six people, to hold a meeting in Commander Xuan's office. The meeting ended at 6:00 PM.

After the meeting, Director Tao met with reporters and said that the preliminary report of the investigation committee had been completed. Today's meeting was to review the reports from the police bureau, the military police regiment, and the investigation team. The issue of responsibility cannot be determined for the time being, and the results of the review have not yet been released. The mystery of who fired the first shot, which is the point of contention between the two sides, will continue to be investigated separately by the investigation team. Tomorrow (referring to today), the Military Law Department will summon relevant witnesses for questioning, and personnel sent by the Ministry of National Defense will be awaited to preside over the investigation.

### Tasks of the Military Police and Police Officials

After arriving in Shanghai, Military Police Headquarters Staff Officer Li Chengren and Police Headquarters Supervisor Wang Zhe gave separate speeches to reporters.

Last August, under the pretext of insufficient educational funding, an educational subsidy of 480 yuan per mu and a construction subsidy of 350 yuan per mu were levied from each district, totaling several tens of millions of yuan; (3) Embezzlement of military rice. More than 2,000 shi of rice were collected, but only more than 1,000 shi were delivered to the provincial government. In addition, the police and security rice for September, October, November, and December of last year were embezzled, and the four days' rice allowance for the entire county's police and security forces has not been settled to date. The District Procuratorate is carefully investigating whether the above accusations are factual.

### The Executive Yuan Has a Unified Interpretation Regarding National Bank Directors Concurrently Serving as Representatives of Public Opinion

Regarding the question of whether directors of national banks should be allowed to concurrently serve as representatives of public opinion, the Ministry of Interior submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. The Judicial Yuan's research concluded that "the so-called national banks, if they are government-business joint ventures organized based on the Company Law, then their directors are merely organs of a private law company and cannot be considered civil servants. However, government-appointed directors who receive salaries are personnel serving in public enterprises as referred to in Article 24 of the Civil Service Law. According to Article 14 of the same law, they may not concurrently serve as senators of provinces, counties, or cities." After receiving the Executive Yuan's instruction, the Ministry of Interior has distributed it to local public opinion organs for compliance.

### The City Council Held a Tea Party Yesterday to Discuss the Military Police Conflict Incident, and Also Reported on the Resumption of Publication of the Xinmin Evening News

[Report from Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu held a tea party yesterday afternoon, hosting all city councilors and city government officials. More than a hundred councilors attended, and Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and heads of various bureaus and departments also attended together. Speaker Pan first reported that the next general meeting was originally scheduled to open on September 9th, but as it coincides with the central government convening the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, it may need to be postponed to late September.

The Xinmin Evening News and other newspapers in the city were previously ordered to suspend publication by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters based on martial law. At that time, the third general meeting of this council resolved to support this decision and requested the government to prohibit the resumption of publication of the newspaper. On July 7th of this year, a letter was received from Commander Xuan, stating that the Xinmin News Corporation admitted that the opinions published in the Shanghai Xinmin Evening News had been inappropriate in the past, and decided to adjust the staff of the editorial and interviewing departments, and applied for resumption of publication. He solicited opinions by letter for reference. On July 15th, we replied, asking the Garrison Headquarters to consider the situation and handle it accordingly. Later, the Xinmin News Corporation again appealed to the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan, which forwarded it to the Executive Yuan for approval of resumption of publication. The Executive Yuan then ordered the Ministry of National Defense, which in turn ordered the Garrison Headquarters to approve the resumption of publication. Therefore, on the 26th, Commander Xuan sent another letter, clarifying that the resumption of publication of the newspaper had been approved. As the Xinmin Evening News admitted that its previous opinions and news handling were improper and was willing to be responsible for rectification in the future, striving to cooperate with national policies and promote government orders, the resumption of publication of the Xinmin Evening News is not inconsistent with the spirit of our previous resolution. Taking this tea party as an opportunity, I would like to make a report to all councilors. After Speaker Pan finished his speech, he invited Mayor Wu to speak. Mayor Wu mentioned the military police conflict incident at the Jindu Theater the other day, saying: The most important thing at the moment is to simplify the complicated situation. As for the issue of responsibility, the central government has sent senior officials to Shanghai to investigate the situation together with the three parties, determine the right and wrong, and then handle it according to military law. The police strike has gradually improved after persuasion and guidance. As of this afternoon (29th), it has fully returned to normal, which is gratifying to everyone. Now, we must clearly define the responsibilities of the military and police to prevent the same incident from happening again.

Commander Xuan's Report

The Xinmin Evening News was suspended from publication at the same time as the Wenhui Daily and the United Evening News in May. Now, the newspaper has repented and improved, and the Executive Yuan has approved its resumption of publication. As for the military police conflict, it is a regrettable incident. The cause of this matter was very small, but the conflict resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and one civilian, and injuries to six police officers and three civilians. Based on this, the calamity was caused by a lack of knowledge of their own powers by some military and police personnel. The police officers were emotionally agitated after the incident. The situation was serious at one point yesterday morning (28th), but it improved in the afternoon, and the situation is not expected to escalate. A three-person team has been organized to investigate the issue of responsibility. The military police and police are originally under the jurisdiction of the Garrison Headquarters, but since I have not yet relinquished the title of police chief, I have telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to send personnel to investigate the truth and make a ruling according to law. The biggest problem in this case is the unclear division of powers between the military police and police. After this incident, it is hoped that the system can be improved.

Councilors Raised Questions One After Another

Subsequently, Councilor Zhang Shizuo, representing the Police Affairs Committee of the City Council, reported on the investigation of the military police conflict. Afterwards, councilors stood up one after another to express their opinions, and some councilors' attitudes towards the military police conflict were particularly激昂. Speaker Shen expressed: (1) Before the responsible investigation agency publishes the truth of this unfortunate incident, it is hoped that fewer opinions will be expressed temporarily, so as not to show partiality; (2) The City Council is an organ representing the public opinion of this city, and it is hoped that the citizens can live and work in peace. The main reason for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident is that the powers of the military and police have not been clearly defined. It is hoped that this incident will prompt the central government to pay attention to improvement; (4) Citizens should respect the spirit of abiding by the law. Watching a play should require purchasing a ticket. This time, three audience members only had two tickets and wanted to enter the venue, which was already undermining the spirit of abiding by the law, and eventually created the fuse for this unfortunate incident. It is heard that one of the audience members is a section chief of the Public Works Bureau. If this is true, the Public Works Bureau should be asked to investigate and deal with it severely. Furthermore, the recent hit-and-run death of Mr. Li Haoran, the former editor-in-chief of the News Daily, was caused by a driver without a legal license. Such disregard for human life should also be paid close attention to by the relevant authorities. Afterwards, councilors Wu Zhengzhuo, Pang Jingzhou, Zhu Zongde, Tong Xiang, Zhang Zhihan, and others spoke successively, expressing their indignation at the illegal destruction of the Jindu Theater, and hoped that the responsible authorities would investigate the truth and handle it impartially. Councilor Wang Xianqing also put forward three points of opinion: (1) The innocent citizens who died should be given preferential treatment; (2) The loss of the Jindu Theater should be compensated by the government; (3) After investigating the truth of the conflict incident, the culprits should be severely punished. Mayor Wu then stood up to reply as follows: (1) The rumor that the military police conflict was caused by a certain section chief of the Fourth District of the Public Works Bureau watching a play without a ticket, or that three people bought a ticket, or that they bought tickets completely, this matter has not yet been clarified, and it is difficult to clarify its responsibility for the time being. If there is evidence, it will be dealt with according to the law; (2) The loss of the Jindu Theater should be compensated by the responsible party after the truth of the matter is clarified; (3) There is no problem in principle with the matter of condolences, but the detailed methods need to be discussed and decided. The tea party ended at 7:30.

### Many Middle School and Elementary School Students in Northeast China Are Not Familiar with National History and Geography; Some Propose Making and Showing History and Geography Films

[Report from Our Newspaper in Changchun, 29th] Many middle school and elementary school students in Northeast China are not familiar with their national history and geography, which is quite distressing. Therefore, their level in national history, geography, and national characters is poor, and they all need to start from scratch. Those who are getting older feel especially anxious. During the puppet Manchukuo era, the Japanese strictly controlled thought and did not allow people to say "Chinese." They were only allowed to say "Manchurian," otherwise they would be slapped. The so-called textbooks emphasized Japanese. Even now, many middle school students find it easier to write notes in Japanese than in Chinese. Some people suggest that the Ministry of Education's electrified education should be promoted to the Northeast first, and the rigid textbook content of national history and geography should be compiled into films and screened in elementary and middle schools in the Northeast to make it easier for students to remember, recognize, and understand, and avoid being trapped in a state of distress for a long time.

### Kang Province Temple Education Plans to Formulate Implementation Guidelines

[Report from Our Newspaper in Ya'an, 29th] The residents of the Kang area in Xikang Province live by both farming and animal husbandry. Herdsmen live by moving with water and grass, and farmers rarely live in collective villages. School education is quite difficult to promote. The provincial government is now specifically formulating implementation guidelines for temple education in response to this special situation. The main points are as follows: (1) Implementing agencies: The counties in the border areas will all organize border education work groups; (2) Scope of implementation: Large and small Lama temples and the farmers and herdsmen attached to the temples in the county jurisdiction; (3) Implementation time: Around the assembly period of each Lama temple, each period is three to five weeks, and one period will be temporarily held each year; (4) Implementation work: Pictures, character cards, popular lectures, interpretation of laws and regulations, knowledge of animal husbandry conservation, picture interpretations, exhibitions of local products and handicrafts, classics, Buddhist instruments, etc., lectures on common sense of family hygiene, equestrian sports, local folk song and dance teams, etc.

### Peking University Professors Suggest: Professors in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin Should Not Be Treated Differently

[Central News Agency Beiping, 29th] Peking University professors Zhao Naibo, Yang Renchan, Zheng Huachi, Fan _, and Zhang Jingyue recently jointly wrote to President Hu Shi, asking him to request the government to improve their treatment. Suggestions include: (1) Distribute rice and flour in kind according to the examples of Beijing and Shanghai, or issue subsidies monthly according to the grain prices in Pingjin; (2) Considering the special needs of Pingjin, distribute coal for winter use, and the methods for distributing valuable items in Beijing and Shanghai should be extended to other regions, and Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin should not be treated differently.

### National Textbooks Still Contain Many Materials from the Anti-Japanese War

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fang Zhimou, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education, praised the national textbooks extensively, saying that their new and perfect content after revision is their characteristic. I recently asked an educator about this matter. According to him, the national textbooks are publications from the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War. Even if they have been revised by the Ministry of Education, it is difficult to expect them to be new and perfect. For example, the 1946 version of the Seventh Series does not have the words "atomic bomb." The 1947 version included a section on "atomic bombs," but it always feels incomplete. There are still many textbooks that stimulate the emotions of the Anti-Japanese War that have not been deleted, such as "Resist! Resist!..." "Charge, charge, charge, charge to the Yalu River and kill all the enemies!" and other motivational textbooks still exist. A new China, which is named as one of the five major powers and advocates world peace, is still using this old wartime textbook. Whether it is appropriate should be given serious attention by the wise Minister Zhu.

### Selection of New President of Jiaotong University: It Is Said That the Authorities Will Choose from Three People, and It Is Said That the Minister of Transportation Will Concurrently Manage It

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to news from Jiaotong University, the authorities are considering choosing the new president of the university from Mao Yisheng, Gu Yuxiu, and Ye Gongchao. Another rumor is that the current Minister of Transportation will temporarily manage it concurrently. Although the Ministry of Education has organized a reorganization committee for the university, it has not taken any new measures for the university so far.

[Another News] A member of the Jiaotong University School Affairs Reorganization Committee told reporters yesterday that the school affairs reorganization will take a month.

### The Importance of Kindergarten

— By Daniel Stone

During this war, the British Ministry of Health, in order to encourage married women to go out to work, created a kind of day nursery. As long as a small fee is paid, mothers can entrust their children to the nursery to take care of them, and they can work with peace of mind. Most of the children in the nursery have become strong, healthy, and independent little guys. However, the purpose of the nursery at that time was only to take care of children, and no kindergarten education was given.

These day nurseries have been transferred from the Ministry of Health to the local education committee, and now they must decide whether to close these nurseries, continue to operate them as they are, or turn them into kindergartens.

Kindergarten education is designed for children from four to five years old. Many experts believe that this period of education should actually be from two to seven years old and should not be interrupted at the age of five.

I have visited a well-run kindergarten. I had a very pleasant experience. I found that boys especially like to make snacks, and girls, when they are not bathing dolls, especially like to do manual work.

A four-year-old child, sitting at the head of the dining table, seems to have a sense of responsibility for commanding everything.

I think kindergartens are beneficial to all children for the following reasons: First, it does not eliminate the influence of mothers and families on children, but instead gives a child with a harmonious family life a sense of security and believes that they have the ability to get along with others in harmony; Second, most families cannot provide children with everything they need, such as dolls, household appliances, building blocks, tools, painting materials, chalk, lime, dough, small plantations, sand and water, and safe open-air playgrounds, etc., but schools have everything. In addition, kindergarten houses are well-ventilated and sunny. The school also strives to focus on educating individuals on cleanliness. Everyone has their own towels, soap, toothbrushes, and combs, and most of the games are held outdoors.

At the same time, the school also has nurses and doctors who pay attention to the initial symptoms of any disease in each child at all times. Most schools also offer diphtheria and pertussis vaccinations.

Most importantly, with kindergartens, mothers can go out to work. In short, this kindergarten has many benefits and no drawbacks. (British Embassy)

Jiguang's Liu Zhaoli, Ling Jidi, Xu Zhengyi, and others served like cannonballs, making it difficult for the opponents to return the ball.

In the first set, Municipal No. 1 almost made a comeback, but the Friendship Team narrowly won 21-19. In the second set, the score was 21-14.

### Qunsheng's Second Battle in Hong Kong: Decisive Victory Over Hong Kong Allied Forces

[Our Reporter in Hong Kong] The Philippine Qunsheng Basketball Team, in their second battle in Hong Kong, played against the Hong Kong Allied Forces at the China Youth Gymnasium on the 24th. Riding on their victory over Nanhua, Qunsheng also decisively defeated the Hong Kong Allied Forces with a score of 54 to 30.

This match was originally scheduled to take place at the Jialishan Nanhua Court, but "Heaven" did not cooperate, forcing the change to the smaller China Youth Court. In the first quarter, Qunsheng was unable to fully display their strengths and was initially defeated by the Hong Kong Allied Forces with a score of 8-6.

Hong Kong Allied Forces Take the Lead

At the start of the game, Qunsheng fielded Li Shiqiao, Cai Wenhua, Cai Wenzhang, Chen Jinde, and Yang Renhui, while the Hong Kong Allied Forces countered with Zhan Shejiang, Lu Zhenxuan, Zhang Shutang, Lu Dezhang, and Shi Zhenda. After the initial contact, Zhang Shutang twice sneaked under the basket, giving the Hong Kong Allied Forces a 4-0 lead. After Wenzhang scored to make it 4-2, Zhenxuan, Renhui, Zhenda, and Wenzhang each scored one basket, and the Hong Kong Allied Forces won the first quarter with a score of 8-6.

Qunsheng Turns the Tables

Second quarter: Qunsheng substituted Jin Dian for Shiqiao, and Renhui tied the score at eight. After Lu Zhenxuan failed to steal a basket, the Hong Kong Allied Forces faced a reversal. By halftime, Qunsheng had turned defeat into victory, taking the lead with a score of 18-12.

Keep Up the Momentum

In the third quarter, Gao Jiahe replaced Zhan Shejiang for the Hong Kong Allied Forces, while Jinde and Renhui were substituted out for Shiqiao and Lian Ke for the visiting team. The visiting team showcased a variety of fancy plays. After Wenhua made a layup and Shiqiao scored on a breakaway, the score increased rapidly. The Hong Kong Allied Forces only managed to regain seven points (Zhang Shutang accounting for six points), ending the quarter with a score of 31-20.

Hong Kong Allied Forces Suffers a Crushing Defeat

In the final quarter, the Hong Kong Allied Forces were able to maintain the situation with long-range shots for the first four minutes. After that, they were at the mercy of Qunsheng and unable to resist, ending the game with a score of 54-30.

The Qunsheng team is scheduled to leave Hong Kong and return to China on the 26th. As most of the team members need to continue their studies and cannot take long leaves of absence, and also due to travel expenses, the trip to Shanghai is unlikely to materialize.

On the 25th, there is still one match against Nanhua at Jialishan. However, the Qunsheng team has stated that they will not play at the China Youth Court. If it rains, the match will be canceled.

### Swimming Across the Irish Sea: A British Swimmer's Feat

The First Person in History

[United Press, Patrick, Scotland, 28th] British long-distance swimming star, 33-year-old Mr. Blue, set off from Northern Ireland on the evening of the 27th to swim across the 25-mile-long Irish Sea. Through dense fog, schools of jellyfish, and strong currents, he bravely advanced for 16 hours and 15 minutes, reaching here at 2:09 PM (British Standard Time) on the 28th, becoming the first person in history to swim across this strait. Mr. Blue is still full of energy and plans to swim back to Northern Ireland.

Chen Jimao, Li Longbiao, and Shen Baihong served as referees. Shanghai Stars were the champions of the previous season. In this season, due to the lack of spirit among a few players and their lax performance, they lost to Post Grade A. The outcome of this match was particularly important. Encouraged by their team leader Qu Yaokang, who had just returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, Shanghai Stars went all out with the determination to win and regain their reputation. Lianxing were originally defeated by Shanghai Stars in the past. However, the young players were full of vigor, winning all five matches in the finals, showing great potential. This reunion with their former rivals was a battle for revenge, so both sides fought fiercely, with rapid back-and-forth play that was breathtaking. Yu Cheng of Shanghai Stars defeated Fan Liangji of Lianxing, tying the score at three each. The final match was even more intense. Li Zongpei of Shanghai Stars played despite being ill, facing the young player Jiang Baiquan of Lianxing. Many worried about Li. However, Zongpei was particularly determined, combining defense and attack with ingenuity. Baiquan was too focused on defense and was ineffective. In the end, Li Zongpei overcame the odds, defeating Jiang Baiquan 3-2. The entire team defeated Lianxing 4-3, turning the tide for Shanghai Stars and maintaining a glimmer of hope for winning the championship. His contribution was truly great. The match results are recorded below:

(Shanghai Stars) (Lianxing) (Score)

Fu Qifang Chen Xingquan 3-1

Huang Zhijun Hu Yiping 1-3

Xue Xuchu Wu Zuochang 3-1

### Chenglie Physical Education College Plans to Reopen

Chenglie Physical Education College in Suzhou was founded for twenty years. Its graduates have served in various regions and enjoyed a high reputation. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by war in the autumn of 1937. The school's president, Chen Dangshi, led the faculty and students to Sichuan. After the victory, alumni in Suzhou, Shanghai, and other regions, considering the school's long history and its founding to commemorate revolutionary martyrs, strongly urged an early restoration. They repeatedly sent telegrams to Mr. Chen, asking him to return east and plan. It is now heard that Mr. Chen arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will soon plan the reopening of the school. A temporary liaison office has been set up at Zhang Jufei's office at the Municipal Gezhi Middle School on Guangxi Road to connect with all sectors of society.

Central, the champion of the Banking Group, played against Zhejiang Xing, the runner-up of the Finance Group. The referee was Jiang Xiaoshi.

However, the five generals of Zhejiang Xing were exceptionally brave and fiercely resisted, causing Central to struggle and ultimately be defeated. Xu Chuanming of Central scored five points alone and was truly an outstanding talent. However, the captain Yu Shouren performed poorly, losing all five matches, which was a fatal blow to Central. Xie Pancai, Chen Honggao, and Wei Kejun of Zhejiang Xing performed the best. In the end, Zhejiang Xing defeated Central 13-11. An unexpected upset occurred in the first Banking and Finance Cup Table Tennis Tournament. The match results are recorded below:

### Representatives of the Review Committee Visit Director Shen to Discuss the Allocation of Industrial Quotas

Serious Consequences May Result if Industry and Commerce Cannot Reach an Agreement

[Our Special Report] Representatives Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, Wu Jichun, and others from the Review Committee for the Allocation of Quota Industrial Raw Materials visited Director Shen Zouting of the Quota Allocation Office of the Import and Export Association yesterday. Previously, the Review Committee had convened various trade associations to discuss the allocation of items such as zinc and various metals and had submitted a report for record. The Allocation Office initially expressed difficulty because the entire agreement on metals was not included. However, after the representatives strongly argued, they agreed to give importance to the percentages stipulated in the agreement. Regarding the allocation of other industrial raw materials, both parties exchanged views. The Review Committee expressed concern about the lack of smooth cooperation among commercial associations and the additional obstacles created by importers. They informed Director Shen that the Review Committee was seeking agreements while the Allocation Office was simultaneously accepting application forms, making it difficult to achieve satisfactory results. They requested that Director Shen establish effective measures to correct the bias. However, Director Shen, considering the vital interests of industry and commerce, urged them to do their best. After the representatives left, they issued a notice scheduling meetings for the Review Committee and representatives of industrial associations on the following two days to report on the progress and discuss the way forward. According to one representative, the Allocation Office stated that seven-tenths of the first quarter's quotas have already been allocated, and the industry wants to know the truth about the allocation. The Allocation Office revealed that representatives from the Paint Commercial Association visited Director Shen Zouting the day before yesterday, hoping to allocate quotas based on their import performance over the years. Director Shen did not express an opinion and only told them to negotiate with the industry. He solemnly stated that serious consequences may result if industry and commerce ultimately cannot reach an agreement.

### The Bullish Side Replenishes on Low Prices, Chinese Stocks Turn from Weak to Firm

Yesterday, speculative forces in Chinese stocks were still limited to Yongsha, followed by Meyer. The process was buoyed by the bullish side replenishing their positions, turning from weak to good. Yonglu's trading was active. Northern traders and various active groups in the securities market became excited about the various speculations on exchange rates and the currency system, and buying interest suddenly increased, gradually advancing after hitting lows. Guangbang No. 218 repeatedly sold aggressively, in large quantities. There was no shortage of buyers after the high prices, resulting in a constant tug-of-war. Small stocks such as New Light, Jingfu, and Huafeng also followed Shuisha in their advances and retreats, gradually stabilizing. All stocks, whether hot or cold, ended the day with more gains than losses. Although the future looks promising, there may still be much fluctuation.

At the start, the report that the reopening of trade with Japan had been postponed had a bullish effect. However, the exchange rate difference with the National Bank before the holiday was significant, and the news that banks and financial institutions would stop using same-day checks from next month made the industry feel pressured. Except for Dishuisha, which was highly speculative and opened low at 228 yuan, other stocks were relatively stable. After Dishuisha opened, Nos. 31, 152, 35, 95, 156, and 224 all sold, falling to 223 yuan. At 9:20 AM, Nos. 223, 117, 112, 127, 203, 173, 32, and 180 all entered, rising back to 234 yuan. Nos. 1511, 185, and 231 were still selling at 234 yuan, falling again to 223 yuan. At this time, Xinyi broke through the 3,000 yuan mark, and Meyer fell to 420 yuan. The various small stocks, such as New Light, Jingfu, and Huafeng, all fell to low prices, appearing very weak. Nos. 104 and 223 took advantage of the low prices to enter at 230 yuan.

At 10:30 AM, due to the small amount of supply from Nos. 129 and 95, the stock was still struggling around 225 yuan. When Meyer showed signs of bullishness, major players such as Nos. 157, 186, 14, and 61 became very aggressive buyers. Di Meyer gradually recovered, soon rising by more than 30 yuan, which slightly boosted confidence. Nos. 54, 4, 173, 112, and 180 became stronger buyers, and Di Yongsha rose back to 236 yuan. After 11:00 AM, Nos. 89 and 223 took profits at high prices, retreating to around 230 yuan. No. 224 covered their short positions, and both spot and forward contracts were being absorbed. Nos. 160, 112, 24, and 224, as well as the Northern gang No. 94, bought aggressively, and Di Yongsha rose to 244 yuan. Small stocks such as New Light and Huafeng also began to recover, while Jingfu had less elasticity. Guangbang Nos. 128 and 154 aggressively sold at high prices, retreating to 238 yuan. Nos. 142, 219, 224, 223, and 157 aggressively bought, and No. 224 also bought spot Yongsha aggressively, with more bullish rumors, finally pushing the price up to 247 yuan. Guangbang Nos. 218, 162, 172, and 3 jointly sold aggressively, and No. 186 also sold. After 12:00 PM, the price once fell back to 238 yuan. Nos. 223, 2244, 152, and 69 still had strong buying interest, and the Jiemian gang also raised prices, rising to 246 yuan. Guangbang No. 218 and the banking gang No. 8 continued to sell, and both spot and forward Yongsha ended at a price of 241 yuan.

The closing bid was stable. As a result, Yongsha, Xinyi, and Yonggongzhong were up about half a percent from the previous close, Meyer and Huafeng were slightly up, and New Light and Xinhua were flat. Jingfu and Qinxing were slightly down, while Commerce, China Silk, Datong, Match, Underwear, and National Goods were all flat. China Textile, Cement, Tongyi, and Jinglun were slightly up, Lilian was slightly down, and Wuhe was down half a percent. Di Jiaogugu accounted for small increases in Huafeng, Meyer, and Xinyi, New Light was still flat, Jingfu was slightly down, Yongsha and Yonggong each rose less than half a percent, and most of the old stocks outside the market rose slightly.

### The Stock Exchange Holds a Standing Committee Meeting; Trading Hours Are Changed

[Our Report] The 22nd regular meeting of the Standing Committee of the Stock Exchange was held yesterday afternoon, starting at 4:00 PM in the Stock Exchange conference room. All members of the Standing Committee attended, except for Mr. Wang Zhixin, who was absent due to a trip to Taiwan. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Du __ and adjourned at 5:30 PM.

At yesterday's meeting, in addition to the routine business report, two proposals were discussed: (1) Due to the hot weather, the market trading hours will be changed starting this Thursday to be from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. (2) Nine members of the Scholarship Management Committee were appointed. In addition to the seven members of the Standing Committee as ex officio members, Yang Yinyu and Gu Shanchang were added as members. The detailed rules for the scholarship will be drafted by Yang Yinxun and then announced.

### Unified Bonds Fall, Foreign Stocks Rise Slightly

Government bonds saw weakness during the middle of yesterday, but were picked up by the Chaozhou gang and Room 360. Although Room 5511 supplied, it was still easy to pull the prices up after they fell. Unified C opened at 8,800 yuan, with a low of 8,200 yuan, and finally hovered around the initial price in the morning, with a turnover of about 3 million yuan. As a result, Unified A, B, C, and E were down 100 yuan from the previous close, and Unified D was down 200 yuan.

Foreign stocks also showed signs of rebounding from lows yesterday. Ewo Silk opened at 77,500 yuan, with a high of 84,800 yuan, before falling back slightly at the close. Securities firms and foreign firms were buyers, while Qing gang and textile firms sold. As a result, Paper, Ewo Silk, and Telephone were up about half a percent from the previous close, while Ewo, Jardine, Arts & Crafts, and Shipping were slightly up. Rongguang and British Allied were both

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Remain Weak

Cotton yarn and cloth prices have been hovering without strength recently. Prices in each market are tight on the surface but loose underneath. While the decline is outwardly attributed to the wait-and-see attitude of buyers and sluggish sales in rural areas, the real reason is that speculators have run out of tricks and hoarders have changed their business, resulting in no large-scale clearing. It is understood that the stock of cotton yarn and cloth stored in this city is considerable and sufficient for long-term needs. The market conditions for yesterday are recorded separately below:

Cotton cloth trading was flat, and the market situation remained stagnant. The reason is that rural buyers are minimal during the busy farming season, and commercial buyers are also mostly cautious and purchase very little. In addition, the authorities have strengthened controls, which dampened confidence, so weavers are turning to other activities. Price fluctuations were limited. Longtou Fine Cloth saw a slight increase compared to the previous day, while other gray cloth and other fabrics showed little change. Native cloth also presented a stable situation. Fangjian opened for sale as usual yesterday (29th). The listed price for Wufu Fine Cloth was 390,000 yuan, and Jinlian Miaowu jacquard was sold at 493,000 yuan.

The demand for cotton yarn was scattered, and most transactions were small. The market rose after being firm, with a fluctuation between ten and twenty thousand yuan. 20-count spun yarn from Shuangma opened at 3 million yuan. Then, the price fell all the way, closing at 1.09 million yuan, down 200,000 yuan from the previous day. 42-count Water Moon was down 200,000 yuan, Blue Phoenix was down 100,000 yuan, and the rest were down from 50,000 to 200,000 yuan.

### Japan's Cocoon Surplus: 1 Million Pounds to be Sold to China at Reduced Prices, Requiring Approximately US$1.8 Million

According to the information received by the Third District Silk Reeling Association, the Silk Guidance Association recently received a telegram from the Allied Headquarters stating that 1 million pounds of Japanese cocoons will be sold to China at a price of US$1.80 per pound, which is more than one-third lower than the price of US$2.80 per pound last year. According to this calculation, a total of US$1.8 million is required, which can produce 2,250 dan of raw silk. If raw silk is sold at US$4 per pound, it can generate US$1.33 million. If foreign exchange is used to buy American silk, at a price of US$0.90 per pound, more than 1.47 million pounds of American silk can be purchased. Currently, the import quota for American silk in the country's silk weaving industry is originally set at US$565,000 per quarter, which is far from enough to meet the huge demand. If this batch of raw silk is exchanged for American silk, it can reach more than 1.47 million pounds. Based on the domestic selling price of 20 million yuan per box (200 pounds) of American silk, 140 billion yuan in legal tender can be obtained. Recovering 140 billion yuan of currency with US$1.8 million in foreign exchange is still a complete calculation. The association is currently calculating and requesting the authorities to jointly operate this silk reeling business with the government and businesses.

### 14,000 Cases of Keemun Tea: Negotiated Purchase by Chinese and Foreign Tea Merchants; Temporary Suspension of Frozen Egg Exports

The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee passed two cases on the morning of the 29th after exchanging views, presided over by Vice Chairman Chen: (1) The China Trust Bureau will be responsible for purchasing part of the expired Keemun tea mortgaged by tea merchants from Chinese and foreign tea merchants. (2) Due to various factors, the purchase of frozen eggs is temporarily suspended. Regarding the first item, the tea in question is the unsold tea from last year that was assisted by the Four Banks Joint Office to mortgage to the China Farmers Bank, which expired this month. Although the principle of purchasing all 14,000 cases of Keemun tea by the British firm Jardine Matheson is acceptable, the committee believes that it is inappropriate for foreign merchants to purchase the entire lot, and the price of only one shilling and two and a half pence per pound seems too low. To adopt a compromise solution, the committee authorized the China Trust Bureau to convene both Chinese and foreign tea merchants to negotiate the purchase. Regarding the second item, the Committee had previously entrusted China to

### Stagnant Rice Digestion Persists; Market Prices Show Slight Increase

Yesterday, the total rice arrival in both the northern and southern markets amounted to over 5,400 shi (石). Retail sales at stores showed some movement. In the southern market, early and late indica rice continued to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while white rice increased by another 10,000 yuan. The northern market saw an increase of 10,000 yuan as well, but consumption remained weak. It is reported that Hunan has already begun operations. As Hunan is the most abundant rice-producing region, a large quantity is bound to flow eastward. At this time of transition between old and new crops, the rice situation is undergoing many changes and is difficult to predict.

Wheat flour sales to the inland north market have strengthened, with improved consumption. Shanghai followed suit to maintain prices, increasing by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Wheat bran also followed the rise of other commodities, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean cakes remained unchanged in Shantou, with subdued acceptance from rural villages. The situation is clearly fixed with slow progress. Soybeans saw slight movement among foreign merchants, with oil mills showing acceptable consumption. Local retail sales continued, with favorable market conditions and another increase of 10,000 yuan. Soybeans from Northeast China and the Yangtze River region have arrived. New soybeans from Sichuan have arrived in Shanghai, and the trend looks weak. Red beans saw decent consumption due to the need for making popsicles in the hot weather, resulting in an increase of 10,000 yuan. Broad bean digestion saw slight movement, with local merchants selectively purchasing higher quality goods. Zhejiang buyers were buying at low prices, resulting in a weak but firm market. Sesame seeds showed stability amidst weakness, while corn softened. Foreign merchants continued to handle raw peanuts, resulting in a surge of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

The oil market experienced mixed ups and downs. Crude oil from Ningbo merchants was initially flat but then tightened, resulting in a rise of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil rose by 10,000 yuan, but sesame oil saw an influx of goods from Bengbu, falling by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The postal savings bureau placed an order with the China Frozen Egg Industry Association for 5,000 tons of frozen eggs for overseas sales, totaling 5,000 tons. Shipments have been ongoing, with the eighth shipment reaching 3,250 tons. The initial price was 9,000,000 yuan, but it has now risen to over 22,000,000 yuan, a significant difference from the previous price. Due to weather and other reasons, both parties agreed to cancel the above agreement, and the matter of frozen egg exports has been temporarily suspended.

### Tea Sales Remain Strong

Various domestic teas, amidst the intense summer heat, saw continued sales from local stores and foreign merchants. This resulted in steady business throughout the day, similar to the previous day. The foreign tea market remains quiet, mainly because exporters are busy fulfilling a recent agreement between Jebsen & Jessen and Morocco for 900 tons of Chun Mee green tea. As a result, demand for all types of tea has decreased, and transactions are declining. However, sellers remain optimistic, and the market remains stable.

### Sugar Prices Retreat

Yesterday, sugar prices retreated by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan because sugar allocation was suspended this week, and holders were reluctant to hold inventory. The association set prices for No. 20 medium white sugar at 557,000 to 560,000 yuan, Taiwanese red sugar at 540,000 yuan, No. 4.5 white sugar at 637,000 yuan, and local sugar also softened slightly, with few transactions. Shantou Jieyang syrup was 410,000 yuan, cotton red sugar was 450,000 yuan, Xinghua white sugar was 565,000 to 570,000 yuan, Xinghua red sugar was 440,000 yuan (second grade at 410,000 yuan), and Hainan red sugar was 430,000 yuan.

### Rayon Initially Weak but Later Firm; Factory Yarn Stable with No Change

Yesterday, the rayon market was initially weak but later firmed. No. 120 Gao Shan (高山) and Asahi (旭字) glossy yarns opened at 24,000,000 yuan. As the allocation price was unclear, holders tried to push up prices, leading to a closing bid up 400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the market remained firm with transactions and continued to rise, eventually closing at 24,700,000 yuan, up 500,000 yuan from the previous day. Tianqiao (天橋) new goods and Toyo (東洋) yarns also rose accordingly.

Yesterday, the factory yarn market was quiet, with stable prices and no changes. High-uniformity grades were quoted at the original price, but there were no transactions. Only a few bundles of medium-grade yarns were traded at 22,800,000 yuan with a five-day premium. Dry spun yarn quotations remained unchanged with very few transactions. No. 28 yarn was quoted between 17,500,000 yuan per bundle.

Yesterday, the silk market declined again. Huaqiang (華強) quilt covers traded at 10,040,000 yuan at the opening. After various attempts to raise prices, they rose from 420,000 yuan to 450,000 yuan, with a selling price of 470,000 to 500,000 yuan, only fluctuating by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Dacheng (大誠) quilt covers were bid at 500,000 yuan, with a selling price of 550,000 yuan. Dacheng check pattern fabrics were ignored, once falling below 4,000 yuan. Intermediate grade traded at 4,040 yuan, with a spot price of 4,400 yuan quoted at the close. Sheng goods were extremely weak. Chongdian (沖電) power-loom cloth was available at 280,000 yuan, and standard grade was also within 300,000 yuan. Hua Gui (華歸) rayon high-end goods traded at 21,500,000 yuan.

### Implementation Plan for Textile Adjustment; Private Mills Hope for No Rigid Regulations

[Our Reporter] Leading members of the Six District Cotton Textile Association continued to discuss the revised Textile Adjustment Implementation Plan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday. It is reported that the private yarn mills felt that some of the amendments by the Ministry of Finance and Economics were still not entirely satisfactory and needed further revision. They also hoped that these amendments would not be rigidly enforced, as they might contradict reality.

According to a leader of a private yarn mill, the government currently controls 75% of the country's yarn production through cotton quota and cotton managed by the Executive Yuan. They hoped that the government would not purchase the yarn spun by each mill from cotton purchased independently, as they heard that the government would collect half of the yarn spun by each mill from domestically purchased cotton. Regarding the future distribution and pricing of cotton yarn, they believed that both should take into account the actual situation and adopt a flexible system. When market demand is high, the supply should be released as much as possible, and a flexible pricing system should be adopted according to the market. In this way, the market will naturally tend to stabilize. The current negotiated price seems to have lost its flexibility, which should be improved.

[Further News] The Textile Adjustment Committee is scheduled to hold a routine meeting at 4 PM this Friday to discuss the revised Textile Adjustment Implementation Plan provided by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and cotton [illegible]. According to a spokesperson for the committee, the first phase of the Textile Adjustment Committee's pilot program for joint cotton yarn distribution involved 20,000 bales, with only about 2,000 bales remaining. Once the distribution is completed, the Textile Adjustment Committee will use the cotton yarn purchased by the Executive Yuan to continue the distribution. It is reported that factories have already submitted more than 20,000 bales, so the distribution of cotton yarn will definitely not be interrupted.

### Discount and Loan Committee Meeting; 26 Loan Applications Approved

Over ten committee members attended, including Qin Runqing, Wu Kexiang, and Pan [illegible] Heng. A total of 26 loan applications were approved, amounting to 5.9 billion yuan.

### Central Trust of China to Launch Group Profit-Sharing Savings Deposits Next Month

### Raw Silk Export Design Meeting

First Meeting Held Yesterday

[Our Reporter] The Design Committee of the Silk Production and Marketing Coordination Committee was formally established yesterday afternoon at 4 PM and held its first meeting at the Central Bank. Many people attended, including Liu Gongyun, Chu Fucheng, Tang Xixiang, Xue Zukang, and Wang Zishuang, with Chairman Liu Gongyun presiding. Liu delivered an opening speech, followed by Tan Xihong explaining the significance of the Design Committee's establishment. Finally, Chu Fucheng gave a speech as a guest, hoping that the establishment of the Design Committee would assist in the export of raw silk. The meeting then discussed the following proposals: (1) Passed the nine articles of the Design Committee's organizational charter. (2) Regarding the raw silk export plan, it was resolved to invite Chang Maiwanjing, Cai Xintao, Wu Shengbo, Ma Ke, and Xue Zukang to draft the plan. The five standing committee members are scheduled to meet at 3 PM today to discuss the plan. (3) The Silk Production and Marketing Coordination Committee submitted four proposals, including the request from silk reeling factories to be issued 20% of the raw silk, and the issue of silk reeling workers.

The Standing Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at 4:30 PM this Friday. However, if converted to legal tender at the official exchange rate, the loss will be more than double. Fortunately, the government can use the foreign exchange earned to import other necessary goods, thereby offsetting the losses. It is said that among the various goods recently sold by the company in the south, cotton cloth accounts for the majority, reaching hundreds of thousands of bolts in July.

### Weak Raw Cotton

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was flat, with sluggish transactions. Yarn mills, expecting the new cotton crop to arrive soon, were eager to clear their inventories, so demand was weak. As yarn prices have gradually risen, cotton clothing sales have slowed down, making it difficult to raise prices. Customers were eager to sell at high prices, but the weak trend made transactions difficult. Bids for factory delivery were 2.2 million for Lingbao, 2.09 million for Shashi, 2.09 million for Chong Shashi, and 1.725 million for Huo Ji. The transaction price was 2.2 million for Lingbao, 2.1 million for Shandong Tuolisi, and 335,000 for Zhoupu seed cotton.

### Greening Qinghai

— Special Correspondent Xu Tang

Qinghai, 21st Air Dispatch

Plant willows across three thousand li,
Bringing the spring breeze through the Yumen Pass. — Zuo Wenxiang

Qinghai is located on the northwest plateau, with a purely continental climate, dry air, and little rainfall. As a result, there are nine harvests out of ten years, and the people suffer from poverty. However, during the summer and autumn, heavy rains sometimes occur, irrigating the mountains. Not only can the water not be contained, but it often turns into mountain floods, destroying crops and drowning people and animals. The losses are immeasurable. In addition, hailstorms occur from time to time, and epidemics are rampant, causing even greater losses to the people. At this time, if afforestation can be promoted early, it will prevent floods on one hand, and the roots of trees entering the soil will also store water, making the ground moist. Even strong winds will not be able to stir up dust. The ground, because of the trees forming forests and the branches supporting each other, can also regulate the climate. As for building embankments along rivers and sandy beaches, it is necessary to have the roots of trees to maintain them, so that the embankments can be strong and not be washed away or sink. Qinghai's construction projects have been advancing rapidly in recent years. The population in various places is increasing day by day. All repairs to highways, bridges, sleepers, and buildings require a large amount of wood to supply needs. Therefore, when the northwest [illegible] defense construction begins, afforestation has become an urgent task for Qinghai's national economy and people's livelihood.

Bringing the Spring Breeze Beyond the Border

Qinghai's afforestation work began at the beginning of the establishment of the province, and was promoted in the 27th year. After the reorganization of the provincial government, the Tao Yin Gongshu (道尹公署, provincial magistrate's office) opened a nursery at the Dajiao Chang (大教場, large parade ground) in Xining City in the 16th year of the Republic of China, pioneering the government's afforestation efforts. In the 18th year, when the province was first established, everything was waiting to be done. In that year, the trees planted were only in four counties: Guide, Ledu, Xunhua, and Huangyuan, with a total of 40,765 trees planted. At that time, the trees planted in the northern ancient city of the provincial capital had already grown into timber, which was continuously cut down for public construction needs. The trees cut down were replanted in the open space as needed, and they have all grown into forests to this day. In the 19th year, the provincial government formulated measures for rewarding and punishing tree planting, and ordered all counties to plant trees diligently in order to promote afforestation. Personnel were also dispatched to various counties to inspect and supervise. In that year, a total of 29,211 poplar and elm trees were planted. The number increased year by year. In the 20th and 21st years of the Republic of China, 73,000 poplar and willow trees were planted successively. Among them, Gonghe and Dulan counties planted more than 10,000 white poplars each. This was the beginning of Qinghai's afforestation work penetrating into the Mongolian and Tibetan areas. The spring breeze beyond the border has been widely introduced. The number of trees planted increased by one fold each year, reaching 200,000 trees within three years. By the 26th year, due to the army and civilians' efforts to suppress bandits, afforestation work temporarily declined. However, Xining, Hualong, and other counties also planted more than 110,000 trees. According to statistics, Qinghai planted approximately 450,000 poplar and willow trees within ten years from the 16th year to the 26th year of the Republic of China.

Greening as a Central Task

In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the provincial government was reorganized. Provincial Chairman Ma Bufang believed that afforestation was the foundation of the economy and construction, so he listed afforestation as one of the six central tasks and resolved to realize the ideal of greening Qinghai. Thus, the great movement to expand afforestation began. First, the number of seedlings that could be collected and the manpower that could be hired in each county were carefully calculated, and then the areas were divided and ordered for all county residents to participate. The results were remarkable. In that year, more than 340,000 trees were planted, almost equal to the number planted in the previous ten years. The following year, along the Huangshui River and near Xingcheng, 400,000 trees were planted, again equal to the number planted in the entire province last year. The total number of trees planted in the 28th year increased to 660,000. In the 29th year, more than 400,000 trees were planted. In the 30th year, another 450,000 trees were planted, with Guide County planting the most. In the 31st year, another 1 million willow trees were planted. In the 32nd year, the provincial government promoted expanded afforestation, and with the construction of the Datong Xiangshan Park, the number of trees planted in one year reached more than 3.1 million. In the following year, Huangyuan and other six counties, due to the large-scale construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Gansu-Qinghai Highway, needed a large amount of manpower, so they did not plant more trees. However, the number of trees planted by public and private schools in that year reached more than 520,000. In the 34th year, in addition to planting white poplar and willow trees, pine, cypress, plum, and apricot trees were added, totaling approximately 5.52 million trees. The forest area near Xining City was assisted and protected by the 82nd Division of the National Army.

Achievements of More Than 40 Million Trees

In March of the 35th spring, the National Government commended Qinghai for its outstanding achievements in afforestation over the years. The entire province was grateful and motivated, and the afforestation work this year was further expanded. School afforestation was also launched, and the results were ten times greater than in previous years. Starting this year, the provincial government specially announced three afforestation methods: first, continue to expand the planting of poplar and willow trees to complete the afforestation work; second, plant elm trees to cultivate hardwood; and third, cultivate peach, apricot, and plum trees to increase people's nutrition and increase hardwood materials. It was also stipulated that: 1. All central national schools in Xining City and various counties should build a school forest in a suitable public location nearby, selected by local elders and gentlemen in consultation with the principal, for easy protection; 2. Each student should plant at least 15 trees and at most 100 trees, with the trees collected from the student's baojia (保甲, administrative unit); 3. Students who are too young to plant trees should have their parents plant them on their behalf; 4. Walls should be built or trenches dug around the forests to prevent trampling by cattle and sheep. As a result of these regulations, school afforestation made great progress this year. A total of 960,142 trees were planted by schools at all levels in the twelve counties.

During this period, the tree planting work of civil servants, soldiers, and civilians in various counties and cities also progressed simultaneously. Among them, from the Mo Zhongquan Bay (莫衆泉灣) and Houzi River (后子河) in the Beichuan (北川) of Huangzhong, passing through the Changningbao (長寗堡) and Zhao Jia [illegible] (趙家[illegible]) in Huzhu County, to the [illegible] Mountain ([illegible]山) in Datong, in this meadow spanning three counties, all officers and soldiers of the 8th Cavalry Brigade and students of the training corps jointly planted trees for more than a month. The number of trees planted was considerable, making it the most outstanding area in Qinghai's afforestation achievements over the years. A total of 13,400,613 large and small white poplar trees and seedlings were planted. This forest area was designated as a special zone, named the "Victory Forest Area" (勝利林區) to commemorate the glory of the rear military construction after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and as a memorial to the Anti-Japanese War [illegible] victory for the province's afforestation cause. [Illegible] Huangzhong County planted a total of 110,635 willow trees. Caojiabao Beach in Huzhu County planted a total of 256,832 white poplar trees. Huangyuan County planted a total of 203,585 white poplar trees. Tongren County planted a total of 13,657 white poplar trees. In Yushu County, 1,488 white poplar trees were planted in Batang Canal and Changgu Temple, making it the year with the most planting achievements in Yushu. In that year, a total of 16,378,791 poplar and willow trees were planted in Qinghai Province, creating a new record for afforestation achievements. From the 27th to the 35th year, the total number of seedlings planted in the nine years reached 33,279,320, an average increase of more than 80 times compared to the afforestation work before the 26th year. In the past 20 years, most of the trees planted in Qinghai were poplar and willow, followed by pine and cypress. Tree planting and seedling planting were used, and the cutting planting method was used. The trees planted along the roads were mostly transplanted. The forests were planted at a distance of about one meter apart, forming rows and columns, which was very beautiful. Ditches were built in the forest area for irrigation. Therefore, the trees planted in the forest areas over the years have been sufficiently moisturized and nourished, and the growth of the trees has become more and more prosperous, forming forests. However, the losses due to water damage and breakage are also not small. This situation has gradually decreased. To date, in addition to those used for public and private [illegible] businesses, 80% to 90% of the trees planted remain. In decades, they will all become pillars for the construction of the northwest.

Since the beginning of spring this year, people, public officials, teachers, and students in various counties have resumed large-scale afforestation. More than 1.28 million seedlings have been collected from the people, and 4,600 laborers have been hired. In addition, the trees are also felled from public forests. In one month, no less than 10 million trees have been planted. At the same time, measures have been formulated to reward private tree planting, and the government will commend those who plant more than 1,000 trees privately. Therefore, there has been a lot of progress in tree planting this year. To date, the total number of trees planted, combined with those planted in the past, has exceeded 40 million.

Tree Planting Has Reached Its Peak

The years of the 35th and 36th in Qinghai can be said to have reached the peak of tree planting. Comparing the achievements of the past 20 years, they have exceeded dozens of times. Therefore, the great achievement of greening Qinghai will be fully realized today. However, when we recall the difficulties of afforestation in the past, it is truly unforgettable. Taking Yushu County as an example, because the area is located in a border area, the customs are undeveloped, the climate is harsh, and the people have no habit of planting trees and do not have enough seedlings. As a result, they had to purchase them from the border of Xikang. This kind of difficulty cannot be compared to any other fact. Therefore, the provincial government specially invented the cultivation of poplar and willow nurseries in order to cultivate trees. The results were very considerable. In addition, they also spent a lot of money and manpower to transplant pine and cypress trees from hundreds of miles away. The cultivation of apricot, elm, peach, and plum trees was also very painstaking. The reason is that these plants were previously only found in areas east of Xining. The people west of Xining were mostly afraid of reform, confined to old habits, and unwilling to plant them. In addition, because they were not familiar with the methods, they could not achieve results, so they went through the motions and planted very little. In order to make the peach, plum, apricot, and elm [illegible] [illegible], the province exchanged wealth and food for seeds and fruit samples, and then distributed them, forcing planting. As a result, the number of elm seeds alone reached 3,934,012 liters. To date, the above trees have all been propagated and grown, and are unusually lush. In decades, in addition to the shade of poplars and willows, Qinghai will be able to see peaches and apricots everywhere, and a colorful and fragrant scene. The use of its hardwood will be a new [illegible] [illegible] for Qinghai's military needs.

The reason why Qinghai's afforestation work has been so rapid is that, in addition to the efforts of the entire province and the annual afforestation, it is also committed to daily forest protection. [Illegible] Currently, each county has forest protection teams in public forests, and their equipment, expenses, and food are [illegible] provided by each government. Therefore, the results of tree planting are easy to show. This is something that can be used as a reference for tree planters across the country.

The slogan of "greening" has now been chanted loudly. In the northwest corner, Qinghai, the trees are already lush green and endless. Now they are persevering in hard work, so the province that will be greened first in the future will probably be Qinghai.

### Public Opinion, Public Hearing: The Third General Assembly of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly

— Our Correspondent Yang Yu

Taipei, 20th (Airmail)

The Taiwan Provincial Assembly - after the February 28th Incident, many people suspected that it had changed its nature. In the past, those who stood in front of the people and shouted loudly became the leading assemblymen who guided the rebellion during the incident. The Third General Assembly of the Provincial Assembly was held again one month and five days after the establishment of the new Provincial Government. Having learned a bloody lesson and welcoming new hope, its significance has become even greater. I dare say that everyone is watching and listening, giving it a new expectation. This expectation is also a test of whether it can truly represent public opinion in the future.

Not Afraid to Say Too Much, Only Afraid Not to Say

Supervisory Committee Member Qiu Niantai was announced by the Provincial Government as the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, but he firmly declined the position. In the opening ceremony of the conference, he was the first to give a speech as a guest. He compared the three meetings and believed that the enthusiasm of the speeches was getting weaker each time. Now that the Provincial Government has been established and Chairman Wei is an enlightened person, he hopes that the assemblymen will regain their spirit. The assemblymen themselves are not afraid to ask Chairman Wei: At present, public morale is low, and there is a difficulty in expressing their opinions freely. Chairman Wei's reply was that the assemblymen are the bridge between the people and the government. Why is public morale low? We should find a reason to seek countermeasures. As for himself, he is not afraid of the assemblymen saying too much, only afraid of not saying anything.

The seats of the assemblymen were initially arranged according to the names of the Second General Assembly, resulting in sparse arrangements, which immediately gave people a sense of steadfastness in adversity. The February 28th Incident was an excessive riot, but also a ruthless melting pot.

Huang Chunbei, who used to be known as the "Hundred-Question Assemblyman," was silent this time and only proposed four motions. On the day of the opening ceremony, he represented the assemblymen in delivering a thank-you speech to Chairman Wei and the heads of agencies and guests. After the pleasantries, he launched into a lengthy discussion, from rice prices to bean cakes, and then from summer cakes to pork. He said, "Farmers cannot afford bean cakes because the price of one bean cake is equal to one catty of rice. Feeding pigs with bean cakes can make one catty of pork sell for 250 yuan." Can one bean cake originally produce one catty of rice? Can one bean cake grow one catty of pork? Many people were dumbfounded by this "thank-you speech."

Two Hundred and Twenty Thousand Children Out of School

Chairman Wei's policy report focused on the economic aspects. He offered three policy measures: regulating materials, stabilizing prices, and providing relief to the unemployed. He requested that prosperity should start with stability, and stability depends on the consolidation of the economic foundation. Regarding the problem of children out of school, he also provided a statistical figure: there are 1,045,000 children of school age in the province, but only 820,000 are in school, accounting for 78.68% of the total. There are 225,000 children out of school, accounting for 21.32% of the total. The education of the next generation has also been devastated by the economic recession.

Chief Executive Chen Yi promised the Taiwanese people that the election of county and city mayors would be implemented from July 1st, as transferred to the Central Government. Minister Bai also issued Bulletin No. 1, stating that Taiwan Province could prepare a proposal for early implementation of popular elections and submit it to the Ministry of the Interior for approval and implementation. The assemblymen asked Chairman Wei to fulfill this promise. Chairman Wei said that he agreed in principle, but had no authority to promise. It was not a matter of willingness but a matter of legislation. He also interpreted the qualification requirement, stating that the appointment of county and city mayors required having served as a Recommended Rank official for more than two years or passing the civil service examination. There were almost no local people who had this qualification. Chairman Wei said very rationally: Now the Provincial Assembly can only make a preparation, which is to study the standard for selecting candidates in the long term and submit the decision to the Central Government for reference.

Currency Reform Date Undetermined

Yan Jiagan, the Director of Finance of the Provincial Government, became the target of criticism from the assemblymen at the Second General Assembly for the 150,000 tons of sugar. Guo Guorui, who earned the title of "Atomic Bomb Assemblyman" for his fiery speech, was in the limelight at that time. This time, perhaps because he had opened a prison, the scene seemed "calm" during the financial report and inquiry. However, what people hoped for was a cold and deliberate suggestion, not a violent and ill-intentioned attack.

The amount of Taiwan currency issued and its possible changes in the future were of concern to the entire assembly. Chief Accountant Pan reported a lengthy number: From July 1937 to May 28th of this year, a total of 8,884,211,093 yuan was issued, of which 3,611,118,331 yuan was collected for old banknotes, and 5,073,112,762 yuan was newly issued. Judging from the fluctuations in commodity prices in this province and the guidance of production loans for economic construction in this province, this number is not too excessive. The adjustment of the exchange rate with the legal tender will depend on the development of commodity prices in Shanghai and this province, seeking flexible changes and applications that can be increased at any time. Although Director Yan did not specify the exact date and amount of the increase, the recent news of a possible exchange rate of one to sixty has been speculated by people. How long will the Taiwan currency be maintained? In the economic reform plan of Executive Yuan President Zhang, it was also mentioned together with the currency systems of Xinjiang and Northeast China, but the timing is unknown.

Public Funding Treatment Is the Best in the Country

The reorganization of the administrative divisions of counties and cities in this province was proposed by Commissioner Lin Xiantang at the Provincial Government meeting. This time, the assemblymen also raised it during the civil affairs inquiry. This overall change involving local conditions, customs, population, transportation, economy, and culture cannot but be carefully considered. Director Zhu also told reporters not long ago that he would base the decision on various data and comparisons.

The call for the employment of talents from the provincial people reflects the distress of the large unemployed group and young people in Taiwan Province. However, Director Zhu stated that a specific plan will be drafted immediately.

Before the opening of the Provincial Assembly, Director of Education Xu inspected the schools at all levels in central and southern Taiwan, so his report contained more practical opinions, such as guidance for the in-service training of national school teachers, summer workshops on teaching agriculture will be held to help teachers learn agricultural knowledge, and national education guidance groups will be organized. Although the number of secondary schools is large, the quality of teachers and school facilities need to be improved urgently. Regarding public funding, students studying in the mainland now receive public funding of 229,500 yuan in legal tender per month, which is the highest in the country. Even within the province, in addition to the Normal College, public-funded and half-public-funded students account for 30% of Taiwan University, the Agricultural College, and the Engineering College. Full public-funded students receive 1,500 Taiwan dollars per month, as well as 70% of the allocated price of white rice.

The police inquiry focused on the issue of police treatment. One assemblyman casually suggested that the police should use gas guns "to avoid shooting at every turn." Director Wang smiled bitterly: "There are no tear gas guns like that in Shanghai now."

Taichung Port Construction Will Be Dealt With Carefully

Yang Jieshou, the Director of Construction, announced three principles for dealing with the issue of opening factories to private management, which is of concern to the people of the province: continuing to start work, openly absorbing idle capital, and relaxing the scope of priority industries. At present, the state-owned shares of match factories, chemical product factories, printing paper industries, and four coal mining companies have been opened to private management. The second step of measures is awaiting research and decision.

The Datian Creek Hydropower Project is of great importance to the revitalization of industry in this province. The entire plan can generate more than 100,000 kilowatts, which is the largest power source in this province. Among them, the Tianleng site can generate 18,000 kilowatts. 70% of the land project has been completed, and the power company has borrowed 200 million yuan from the Bank of Taiwan to prepare for resumption of work. The machinery has been negotiated for purchase in Japan and Canada.

The Japanese completed 60% of Taichung Port after five years of construction. Director of Transportation Chen explained the reasons for stopping construction: the budget is 5 billion Taiwan dollars, and the provincial government does not have this financial capacity; the Japanese built it hastily, and there are irreparable major errors in the plan; this province already has the three major ports of Keelung, Hualien, and Kaohsiung, which are sufficient for throughput, so it will stop.

Progressive Purchase of Surplus Grain from Large Households

After a debate at the Provincial Government meeting, the price of food purchased with taxes and the purchase of surplus grain from large households were sent to the Provincial Assembly for research. This was the highlight of the conference, the finale! Enthusiastic speeches and fierce debates were held because this was a matter of vital interest to six million people. For the purchase of rice with taxes, 12 kilograms of dry rice husks are purchased for each yuan of the regular rice field tax (land rent); large households refer to those who pay more than 1,000 kilograms of rice husks for the annual field tax at one time. Surplus grain refers to the grain collected by large households, excluding the field tax, public grain, and rice purchased with taxes, as well as the household's own consumption for the current period (limited to ten people, with a monthly consumption of 21 kilograms per person). A progressive method is adopted to purchase 40% of the grain from 1,000 to 5,000 kilograms and 60% of the grain from more than 30,000 kilograms. The Grain Association Bureau set the price at 16.5 yuan per Taiwan catty (27.5 yuan per kilogram), which was met with opposition at the meeting. It was believed that the price was too low. The Grain Bureau presented figures stating that the increase in the circulation speed of the currency issuance was insufficient; the treatment of civil servants and teachers could not keep up with commodity prices, which was also insufficient as a basis; although the commodity price index was quite reliable, it was based on the cost of production to encourage production, and each thousand Taiwan catties should be 16,466.20 yuan.

"Low grain prices hurt farmers, high grain prices hurt the people," "Without actually farming, the investigation will not be accurate."... The debate lasted a whole day on the 27th. As a result, someone shouted: "Large landlords should show conscience!" followed by applause.

The price was newly passed! The price is still 16.5 yuan per Taiwan catty, with two sentences attached below: "The government should prevent the reduction of the amount of food and actively encourage increased production due to the implementation of this plan."

Chief of Staff Chen Cheng arrived at Kuanchengzi Airport in Changchun on a special "Chasing Cloud" plane. Chen shook hands with the welcomers with a smile. One of the welcomers was General Pan Yukun, the commander of the New First Army. (Our correspondent Zhao Qingshu from Changchun)

### Escaping the Summer Heat in Hangzhou

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

July 26th

This summer, the Meteorological Observatory reported: "The tropical air current covering the entire country and the nine eastern provinces and the Pacific air mass in Japan, Ryukyu, and Taiwan are in contact in the Sea of Korea." No wonder the climate across the country is much hotter than in 1946. Hangzhou's West Lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides and a bustling city on one side. In summer, the sun shines down fiercely, absorbed by the trees and grass on the mountains and accepted by the water in the lake. After absorption and acceptance, it evaporates, so the heat waves are constantly surging. Some people say: "Hangzhou is very close to the ocean. If there is a sea breeze in summer, there would even be a unique coastal climate like Qingdao." But Hangzhou does not have these favorable conditions.

West Lake Is Like a Pot of Water

Some people say that West Lake is like a pot of water. She is surrounded by mountains, and the sun is like fire, constantly boiling it. This pot of boiling water cannot release steam, only the people of Hangzhou are suffering. Really, in the recent days of heat waves, the summer nights of West Lake are only cool after eleven o'clock in the early morning. At other times, the temperature is above 90 degrees. Otherwise, if you row a boat in the lake, it is like rolling in boiling water.

In Hangzhou, although it is also one of the cities that accepts civilization and enjoys it most quickly, it is not as much as Shanghai. The large hotels, restaurants, and theaters in Shanghai have air-conditioning equipment, and even many wealthy and well-off people have air-conditioning in their homes to regulate the temperature. No matter how much it costs to cool down in a day, there are still many people enjoying it. But Hangzhou does not have this blessing.

The Movie Theater Is Hotter Than a Furnace

One movie theater has more than twenty electric fans, which is actually advertised, but the electric fans in various entertainment venues cannot be turned on frequently, so they can only be turned on and off from time to time. Like the movie theater, the fans are only turned on after the movie starts. Therefore, entering the movie theater is like entering a furnace. Men take off their clothes, and women unbutton their cheongsams. There is also a famous Hangzhou restaurant, Tianxianglou, which is promoted as having air conditioning, but when you enter this restaurant, there are only a few electric fans. In the past, Hangzhou had electric fans for rent, but now they are gone. An ordinary oscillating electric fan sells for more than two million yuan. I asked a hardware store, and the owner said: "There are not enough electric fans to sell, who still rents them? The factories that produce electric fans have stopped working this year, so the price of electric fans is so high."

Various Ways to Cool Down

Hangzhou's ways to escape the summer heat cannot be compared with Shanghai in terms of enjoyment. Therefore, this year, wealthy people in Hangzhou have gone to Shanghai to escape the summer heat. It is said that Mogan Mountain is also extremely hot, and several foreign friends have run down from the mountain. A Hangzhou friend in his sixties said to me: "This kind of weather is really unbearable. Not to mention outsiders, even the people of Hangzhou cannot stand it." However, as a local Hangzhou person, he still has ways to escape the summer heat, such as going to the tree-lined buildings in Lingyin Temple, the top of Yuhuang Mountain, or the Yanhua Cave and Ziyun Cave to cool down. Some go to Chenghuang Mountain to enjoy the breeze, or drink tea at Pinghu Qiuyue. These days, the tea seats on Chenghuang Mountain are crowded. One side faces the Qiantang River, and the other side leans against West Lake. The cool breeze is a very good place. Pinghu Qiuyue relies entirely on the wind blowing from the lake. People in the bustling city regard the quiet places around Hubin and Lihu as summer resorts. In fact, in my opinion, Hangzhou must have cool places, but they have not been arranged into an environment where one can escape the summer heat. For example, at Chenghuang Mountain, Lingyin, and Yanhua Cave, a few houses can be built to live in, and naturally one will forget the torment of the summer heat. However, most of the people are still immersed in the heat wave and cannot get rid of this heat attack, which is naturally in vain.

From the First Fu to the Third Fu

The weather in the hot sixth month of the lunar calendar is divided into the first fu, second fu, and third fu, according to Chinese custom. After the three fu days are over, it means that autumn is coming. The people of Hangzhou, of course, only wear extremely thin clothes to deal with these "three fu" days. Ordinary families have silk trousers and silk shirts. If the residence is too stuffy, it can be moved to the street to sleep. Special attention is also paid to eating. Wealthy families often have "ham in the first fu, chicken in the second fu, and gold and silver hooves in the third fu." Ordinary and poor families have "amaranth in the first fu, eggplant in the second fu, and winter melon with the skin on in the third fu." Researching why they eat like this, some say that wealthy families have something to eat, and poor families have nothing to eat. Wealthy families think of ways to eat, so poor families also think of ways to eat to counter them. In fact, in this hot summer, ham, chicken, and gold and silver hooves are not very greasy and are very refreshing. Amaranth, eggplant, and winter melon with the skin on can all relieve the summer heat.

When the people of Hangzhou feel uncomfortable in the summer heat, the first step is usually to scrape sha, that is, to scrape the neck and arms with their fingers until they turn red. The second step is to drink ten drops of water, and then send them to the hospital. However, some wealthy families buy a lot of honeysuckle dew and other things from Hu Qing Yu Tang in the summer to relieve the summer heat. Recently, watermelons have been on the market, and 600 yuan can buy a catty, but real Haining watermelons are not easy to find.

Lingyin Sutra Lecture

The Lingyin Temple specially launched a sutra lecture, inviting Abbot Chishong of Jing'an Temple in Shanghai to be the main speaker. On the day of the lecture, I made a special trip to listen. He lectured on the Prajna Paramita Sutra on Benevolent Kings Protecting the Country. He began by saying: "In such hot weather, everyone has 'troublesome heat', but the hot weather is easy to pass, and the troublesome heat in the heart is not easy to disappear for a while." Then he talked about the principles of benevolent kings protecting the country, hoping that everyone can protect the country with a benevolent heart, so that disasters can be eliminated and troubles can be thrown away. There were many people who went to listen at that time, and Mr. Ma Yifu, the president of Fuxing Academy, also went. In such a hot summer, lecturing on the sutras to calm the mind is very good, but it is a pity that most people who are busy all day long cannot comprehend this learning of calming the mind and cultivating the nature.

Since the beginning of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, the sky in Hangzhou has not seen the slightest sign of rain. We cannot help but be moved by the diligent spirit of the farmers plowing and watering in the fields. How do they get rid of this long summer heat? Only after work, drink three small glasses of white wine and eat four cloves of garlic as the only good remedy for relieving the summer heat.

Refusal to Vacate After Expiration: A Dispute Over Rice Mill Lease

Dear Editor, my ancestors left a rice mill, but no one operated it after the war. Then, it was rented to Mr. Zhang for operation, with a contract of two years, which has now expired. Mr. Zhang insisted on renewing the lease, but repeated negotiations were ineffective. Now, I plan to resort to the law, but civil lawsuits require the payment of the subject matter of the claim. I am now working in a professional institution. My three meals are still insufficient, how can I pay this huge amount of the subject matter of the claim. I have always admired your lawyer's service to the people. Now, I have the following points, please give instructions. I am very grateful. (1) The lease was signed on April 1, 1945, for a term of two years. At that time, it was stipulated that the lease could not be subleased during the lease term, but the factory added business registration in April 1946. I believe that there were obvious abuses, and I intended to terminate the contract, but I was dissuaded by the mediator. Now, the factory has added business registration again, and the lease contract expired on March 30 of this year. Can I stop its business and limit the time for it to move out? (2) If I am unable to pay the subject matter of the civil lawsuit, can I request the court to postpone or waive the payment? Xu Zhenzhi

[Answer by Lawyer Zhu Yabu:] (1) Since the lease contract stipulates that subletting is not allowed, and the lessee does not comply with the terms of the lease contract and subleases the house in question, a lawsuit can be filed to request vacating. (2) You can request litigation assistance. As for the litigation fees, they are slightly collected at the rate of thirteen thousandths of the value of the subject matter.

### Tagore's "Patriotic Song"

— Xiao Dai

I once read an article about Tagore, saying that Tagore's works were introduced to China as early as the 8th or 9th year of the Republic of China. Before that, the literary world had never heard of Tagore's name. But another said that Tagore's works had already been introduced to Chinese readers as early as the 5th year of the Republic of China. At that time, because I had not seen it myself, I naturally did not dare to add to it. Recently, when I went to Santiniketan to collect some "antiques," I unexpectedly found a broken and incomplete copy of the February issue of the 5th year of the Republic of China, "The Great China Magazine," edited by Liang Rengong.

Opening it up, I found an article "Introducing Taia'er" written by Ouyang Zhongtao. I think this "Taia'er" is Tagore. In addition to introducing Tagore's life and his theory, the article also contains several of Tagore's poems. This is probably the work that first appeared in Chinese literature mentioned above.

Here, I transcribe the translated "Patriotic Song" and the two poems with the original name "Iron."

Patriotic Song:

Oh, motherland, the place where my soul leads, built by my ancestors!

Loyalty is the end of life, I should dedicate my body to it.

I rejoice and sing, singing the beauty of the country;

Sometimes I turn my back and weep, weeping for the grievances of the motherland.

Although my arms are weak, I support the motherland, and my strength is stronger.

Who are you who are hurting the country? I will decide! I hear the Taia sword, I hold it bluntly!

Oh, motherland, the place where my soul leads, built by my ancestors!

Maxim:

You, provincial teacher bee, fly and swim in the sky, hungry for thousands of flowers, brewing good guests, so you cannot hide deeply in the cave.

Do not imprison yourself, narrow and filthy, and live in a day of expansion and governance, but also a new prison, feeling free to cross the garden walls.

The translation style is very classical, quite like Yan Fu and Lin Shu, respecting tradition and emphasizing the style of rules. But it is concise and readable, and it is still not a bad translation. However, at that time, whether anyone noticed that this "Taia'er" was the Tagore who later became famous in China, it is not known.

### The Abandoned

— Lu Yu

Last autumn, a certain XX army unit was stationed in the village.

The captain, surnamed Qiu, was a small man of medium height with a fair, square face, neither fat nor thin. He was very handsome, even though he was over thirty.

In less than a week, a rumor spread through the village: it was said that Amaotou’s mother had promised Amaotou to Captain Qiu.

"Really?"

"Is there anything false about it? Last night, someone personally saw Captain Qiu and her walking arm in arm from town; behind them was a soldier carrying a package of clothing material under his arm..."

Since this rumor was revealed, those who liked to gossip began to use it as big data for conversation in taverns and teahouses.

Amaotou’s family only had an elderly mother. The two relied on the dozen or so acres of land left by her father after his death to make a living. Although she only had a sixth-grade elementary school education, she was the only literate girl in the village.

She usually liked to wear foreign cloth; her hair was already cut short like a female student. She often applied snow cream to her face, and she liked to learn fashion from the girls in town. However, the surroundings of this village were still very feudal, so the people in the village had long held her in contempt.

A month later, for some reason, the troop stationed in the village suddenly received an order from above and busily prepared to move elsewhere. So, the night before, Captain Qiu specially came to her house to say goodbye.

"What, you're going too? How can that be?" her mother said when she knew she was going.

"Mom! Didn't you already promise me to him? Why are you objecting now?" she suddenly replied to her mother.

"It's not that Mom is objecting, but I'm saying you haven't even gotten married yet. What does it look like if you go with him now?"

"He wants me to go back with him. He said the people in the troop move around and don’t have a fixed place, so they can't be scattered in the future."

"………………"

Her mother was silent for a long time, feeling very regretful in her heart.

"Mom! Don't be sad. Now it's the new way. Marriage can wait until later," she finally said to her mother with a reassuring tone.

That very night—a dark night without a moon—Amaotou finally left the village with Captain Qiu's troop.

After Amaotou left, the people in the village criticized her behind her back, saying:

"Amaotou is getting worse and worse. I can't believe her mother let her go..."

Later, according to what her mother said to others, "I only blame her father for letting her study for a few years. The little girl changed. Last time my sister-in-law came to arrange a marriage for her, the little girl not only didn't agree, but also said that marrying a farmer would never allow her to get ahead in life. I didn't expect that Captain Qiu came and they were messing around together after only a few days. I could see that they already had a relationship, so for the sake of the Zhu family's reputation, I just went along with it. I only have this one daughter. As long as she is willing, that's all that matters! It's very difficult being a parent now..."

Days passed like flying. This summer, Amaotou suddenly returned from Shanghai on a steamship to her hometown, which she had left for fourteen full months. When she passed by the neighbors in the village, she quickly slipped past, feeling a burst of indescribable shame in her heart. However, when she stepped into the village, someone had already spotted her in the fields.

"Amaotou is back!"

"Amaotou is wearing a white coat and white leather shoes..."

"Look! Amaotou has turned into Guanyin Bodhisattva..." especially the children shouted madly.

Amaotou quickened her pace and ran home. When she saw her mother's face, she couldn't help but cry. Anger and resentment surged into her chest.

"Ah, Amaotou! You're back. Mom missed you so much! You haven't sent a single letter in over a year," her mother said as the first sentence. However, Amaotou walked into the room and collapsed on the bed, covering her face with her hands, silent for a long time.

"Amaotou! Are you seasick? Are you tired from the journey?" her mother went over and took one of her hands, saying: "Eh! What's wrong... tears are coming out?"

"………" She still didn't answer, but started to cry out loud.

"Tell me, what exactly is going on?" her mother asked anxiously.

After a long time, she finally said in a low voice, weeping:

"He has completely changed..."

### Ascending Ziling Fishing Terrace

— Luo Junti

In the sixth month, one still wears light clothes, and strange events ultimately shock customs. Once in the imperial capital, one travels a thousand miles to visit a lofty recluse.

The fishing terrace retrieves silk cords, while carriages gallop through Kyoto and Luo. How can they compare to wearing rough clothes and fishing in the spring river?

### Lamenting at Xie Gaoyu’s Tomb While Ascending Ziling Fishing Terrace

— Luo Junti

Song Jun had Wen Tianxiang, and Tianxiang had Xie, the military advisor. The relationship between the lord and the advisor was like fish and water, and the relationship between the province and the subject was like dragons and clouds. If it weren't for the rebel Zhang Hongfan, Jingnan and Zhao Prefecture might not have sunk and fallen. The advisor also lived in the fields, but the enemy forces descended on Linan and were unstoppable. He diligently raised troops and scattered his family wealth, starting an uprising in the desert alone. Alas, success or failure depends on heaven, and war or peace depends on oneself. It is better to die in battle than to surrender, and one's lonely army can only depend on its strength. When he heard that the young lord had died at Yishan and that the chancellor had died in Yanjing, the advisor's grief and righteous indignation were difficult to contain. He did not become a leftover subject or a fugitive, wearing hemp clothing and a rope belt, running through the mountains and marshes. The clouds and mist are like those of yesteryear, feeling sad at the thought of old friends. I secretly ascend Ziling Fishing Terrace, at a time when the weather is cool and the wind is stronger. I set up sacrifices and pour wine to summon the soul, singing sorrowfully and weeping, lifting bamboo and stones. The bamboo and stones shatter, and the liver and intestines split. The shame of the fallen province, when will it be avenged? The hatred of the subject, when will it be extinguished? The clouds are gloomy and the heavens and earth are sad, the water splashes and the ghosts and gods weep. Ziling Fei is proud of his loftiness and takes no responsibility for the rise and fall of the world. How can passers-by only know the name of Ziling Fishing Terrace, and not know that Gao Yu's tomb is on the side of Ziling Fishing Terrace?

Pausing, she continued, sobbing, "After I left, in less than a month, he took me to Shanghai, and I found out that he was a married man. At the time, I thought the deed was done, so I endured it all along. I didn't expect that recently, he picked up a vixen from who-knows-where… He has completely changed…" She didn't finish speaking, and lifted her left leg for her mother to see; she told her mother that the blue marks were from him kicking her with his leather boots...

This was like a bolt from the blue, and her mother was stunned.

### Tilanqiao and Flower Street

— Li Weichu

Tilanqiao, this is a beautiful name. When I saw it for the first time, it made me think of the story of the water flooding the Blue Bridge that I often heard in my hometown as a child—this story is almost as famous as Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, although "籃" (basket) is not "藍" (blue). Later, after passing through the tall walls of the Shanghai Prison, there were often many young women in blue clothes and plain skirts with sorrowful faces, and a few lightly made-up young girls carrying goods with tear-reddened eyes, standing there waiting expectantly. A friend said: This is truly "A Waterloo Bridge of the Soul"! So I told her that every time I passed by here, I would always think of that famous movie; "Waterloo Bridge," the clear, beautiful, and expressive Vivien Leigh, the large and moving eyes, and the tune that made people's hearts intoxicated, like the murmuring of flowing water, these were deeply imprinted in my memory.

So, with many beautiful feelings in my imagination, I walked along the way, which was a very beautiful and famous little street here. Therefore, wouldn't you walk to the left? Then, I hope you walk to the left. The first facade is a small flower shop with a transparent glass room. In front of it, on the left, there were four or five flower stands with white, blue, and pink chrysanthemums, pale yellow large-petaled daffodils, bright purple roses, and bright red camellias. In addition, there were peach-red oleanders and pale yellow wild roses, all bright and beautiful, always attracting attention. Walking slowly past, not far away, there was another one, which was a larger branch store diagonally across from this one. The flowers and plants displayed here were more diverse and more expensive.

When I first walked into this street, it was a cool morning. It was my first time going to the office, and my heart was full of freshness. Just as I faintly smelled a faint and quiet fragrance in my nose, it quickly made me feel as if I was walking in the atmosphere of the ancient capital; there was a momentary trance of intoxication. This faint and quiet fragrance, transmitted to the bottom of my heart, gave me a quiet and distant meaning, and aroused memories and reflections of a distant dream. In Shanghai, a bustling, restless, and licentious Shanghai, is there such a mood? Yes, and this is in Peiping! So I recalled the cool and illusory taste of the ancient shore under the shade of the North Sea, the bright moon, and the crystal coolness of Wangdai Bridge, and I wanted to cry, but I felt comforted in my heart—until I woke up from this and looked around, I realized that all I saw was a patch of white. In front of the flower window, there was a whole patch of drooping night-blooming jasmine!... So I loved this street. I liked this little street just like I liked a quiet friend to talk with. Every day, at dusk or dawn, stealing a few minutes of leisure, I would rather walk a little farther to go there and see, lingering at the flower stalls, gazing at the flower shops, and paying attention to the flower varieties. I secretly called this little street Flower Street in my heart, or said: Flower Street in my soul.

And you, don't say: Am I intoxicated? Dreaming? Escaping? Or say leisurely sentiment, or say indulging in pleasures?

But, dear, in this extremely painful reality of life, in these helpless days, this is just a consolation, not an addiction.

(7/3, 3:00 AM, Shanghai.)

### Pine and Cypress of Nanshan (Painting for the Longevity Hall)

— Wang Shengyuan

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 362

— Ye Jingfeng

We all have a lot to talk about, and there are many opinions that must be exchanged. Yaogun definitely wants to know the situation of the headquarters these few days, and also wants to hear about Tsurumi's and Pingzi's work in Shanghai, as well as the current situation and location of the two people (she doesn't know that Tsurumi was called back to Tokyo for training). As for Zhan, he certainly wants to know that Yaogun and Little Tiger returned to Shenyang and Tianjin, how the two of them got separated in Tianjin, and how they got to Changping, all the experiences, etc.; how big is the strength she recruited, and why was someone arrested in Changping? What steps has she planned for Liu Ruming's actions, and so on. As for Dingyuan, I think his current environment and work are absolutely not suitable for him; if this continues, in less than two or three weeks, I'm afraid he will encounter a life-threatening danger. It seems that we should have a thorough review.

As soon as Little Tiger left, Yaogun indeed asked about the Beijing headquarters and Tsurumi. I told her that the Beijing headquarters was not as active as before on the surface. Besides looking for intelligence, it was only temporarily lurking. Kawashima Yoshiko and other dogs of the Matsu Group have not bothered us. Now we are contacting Song's troops in Zhuozhou and planning a counterattack; the counterattack will likely happen soon.

Secondly, I explained in detail what happened to me on the fifth day in Tianjin. Just as I was about to talk about Tsurumi, Little Tiger had hurried back, holding a note to Yaogun. After reading the note, Yaogun pondered slightly, then carefully folded it up and put it in her upper pocket; only then did she concentrate on listening to me tell the story of Tsurumi and Pingzi to Shanghai.

I told this story in considerable detail, because Yaogun was very concerned and had taught Little Tiger and Dingyuan a little bit about the people on both sides, and their spirit and preparations for the war of resistance. Little Tiger often listened with great interest; when I talked about the naughty Miss Zishan of Baininzhuang going to test Tsurumi's situation, he wanted to open his mouth to ask questions, but Yaogun stopped him. When Yaogun heard that the four young ladies had suddenly broken into the tiger's den and rescued Pingzi with a light touch, she also nodded and danced with joy, admiring them very much.

Only Dingyuan, who was not healthy, had lost his health after his illness. As for food and accommodation, I have already seen with my own eyes that the housing is these two broken thatched cottages; the food is definitely not good, just some gruel, how can it provide him with the nutrition he needs? Probably he didn't sleep well last night after coming back from me, so he felt tired while listening, just barely supporting himself, sitting for a while, then getting up and walking around. After walking a few steps, he couldn't walk anymore and ran to lie on the pile of grass in the corner. I know his temper. But I felt unspeakably uncomfortable in my heart. Since the July 7th Incident, the Japanese invaders have been rampant, and among the relatives and friends I knew, his experience was the most...

Just as I got to the point where Tsurumi returned to Beiping because I urged him, Da Dazi carried a package, gently put it down, and stood straight in the corner, staring at me with big eyes, waiting for a chance to speak.

"Is everything better?" I cut off Tsurumi's story and asked Da Dazi… (562)

### Thought · Landscape · Character

— Fang Yu

If "friendship" can also be measured by "gold bars", I would rather be "lonely".

When a person who is honest, upright, and full of a sense of justice is driven by "greed", he has also chosen "funds".

I once lived in a damp, sunless underground hole, with no air, water flowing under my feet, and a foul odor permeating my nose. This is a "territory in paradise" in the "Eastern Paris" that ordinary people yearn for.

But just one floor above me, the landlady increased the price to eight gold bars, which is 160 million yuan at the current market price.

You calculate, how many lifetimes would it take for a working class or a civil servant to accumulate this terrible number.

But, you know, those 1947 streamlined cars, don't each of them cost more than a dozen gold bars?

Many people have no houses to live in, but many people, like incinerators, occupy many houses. They become nouveau riche out of nowhere, and become big customers in the coin-operated market!

A friend from Hong Kong tried his best to say how safe life in Hong Kong is, and how cheap things are.

It is said that when our call to reclaim Hong Kong was high, the new Governor of Hong Kong once declared: "Hong Kong should not be returned to China, it can be voted by Hong Kong residents"!

This is such a conceited and sharp diplomatic term, but it also contains a summary of many problems.

As a Chinese, you can listen to the talk of British gentlemen.

### Equal Sacrifice

— Wang Pingling

In love and friendship, those who are willing to suffer losses are mostly poor. Rich people also seem to have times when they suffer losses; but this is a speculative investment, and they hope to gain more rewards. Poor people generally have a generous and tolerant spirit, but unfortunately, the living resources of poor people are very limited. They also have to find ways to survive and do not have extra benefits to supply their exploitation. In fact, due to the helplessness of not being able to help, there may be times when promises to friends cannot be fulfilled. In this way, friends not only forget your past feelings, but often harbor permanent resentment due to temporary disappointment. In the end, the friends you think are the best all become strangers who have nothing to do with you; therefore, a person who loves friends the most has the fewest friends.

The fertilizer of friendship is mutual tolerance and concession. In case the other party is absolutely selfish, then absolute "altruism" is also a factor in maintaining friendship; because your friend often wants you to do things that meet his needs, giving up your rightful rights. After giving up, you must never complain publicly. The painful tears can only flow into your stomach, and when facing your friend, you must also endure the pain and pretend to be a clown-like smile, so that your friend thinks of his own success in your smile; and that is not the reward for what you have given up. In such a situation, it is the Chinese streamlined "way of making friends". What is friendship? "It is a kind of irredeemable loss that you constantly sacrifice for people you usually treat as friends."

When an unknown person suddenly becomes prominent, telegrams, eulogies, letters... will fly from all corners of the world. Although you don't know their names, they are all intimate, addressing you as brothers and friends, precisely because this person has extra benefits to meet everyone's needs; when he leaves the position of issuing orders and has nothing to meet everyone's demands, his door will be deserted. But sometimes, when the extent of your sacrifice for a friend exceeds the friend's ability to repay, the beneficiary often feels embarrassed and gradually becomes estranged from you, even deliberately avoiding you, not seeing you, for fear of causing shame and guilt; so those who are too fussy about friends, and whose sacrifices exceed the limit, fearing that friends will not be satisfied, are also people who have no friends.

Is there pure friendship in the world? Yes, the disciples of the sages say: It is a friendship of morality and justice. However, this explanation makes me even more confused. I think that pure friendship should be a kind of equal sacrifice between friends, that is, roughly the same amount of wading and loss. The interaction between countries is the same. As for the entanglement formed between men and women due to sexual demands, it is usually called love. The two parties who practice love call each other lovers, but in reality, it is also a kind of equal sacrifice that occurs between men and women.

With equal sacrifice, one party shows the fact of sacrifice, and the receiving party feels indescribable gratitude deep in their heart and wants to find an opportunity to repay it.

A feeling of gratitude is a burden on the conscience. When one is unable to repay it, one feels guilty. Friends forgive their mistakes with an overly generous attitude, or solve their difficulties with unexpected kindness. The feeling of gratitude arises spontaneously; however, those who are willing to sacrifice never want to accept the sacrifices of their friends. When it is absolutely necessary, they can only accept it. This is not a right, but an obligation, and they ultimately hope to have the opportunity to serve him and resolve this wish, although the friend who is prepared to sacrifice does not care about your repayment. Such behavior is the equal sacrifice shown between friends. Equal sacrifice can not only support friendship but also improve mutual trust and increase the element of purity.

Similarly, if there is such a thing in the world as a happy marriage that "declares the continuation of our pure love", I think it is nothing more than a helpless repayment in which one of the two parties receives endless grace, is moved to tears, and has nothing to repay. When a man and a woman recognize each other, feel satisfied, and begin to build a friendship, one of them will inevitably show the highest demand, anticipating a major defect that must be revealed in the other party's heart that is eager to make up for it, pressing him to use various techniques to create many gifts that are enough to make the other party feel grateful, and never hoping for any repayment, until the other party feels that only by contributing the last bit can he repay the burden on his soul, then the so-called pure love union is manifested in behavior in the form of an equal sacrifice between men and women.

Equal sacrifice is the proper way to make friends, and it can also be said to be the virtue of mankind; but this kind of "communication" is no longer common. At this moment, only one party sacrifices, and the other party is only absolute exploitation. Everyone is trying to absolutely exploit people and absolutely not be exploited by others. Therefore, the people who are seeking needs in the society are all in a state of danger, chasing and killing each other in the beauty of people, seeking profit, and capturing their prey. What is friendship? It is the diplomatic rhetoric of hiding a knife in a smile, the disguise of a robber, the crocodile tears of kindness, the meaningless prayer hummed by the professional priest when a criminal is executed!

### Qiu Weng Is Writing His Wartime Memoirs

— Xie Zhangtao

To be Published in Full Starting Next Year

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill is the only one who has been involved in the highest decision-making of World War II from beginning to end. During the war, he enthusiastically searched for and preserved various historical materials - letters, memos, meeting records, and other precious private diaries. Now, in the guise of being out of office, he is starting to write his historical magnum opus - his wartime memoirs. It will be published serially in "Life Magazine" and "The New York Times" starting next year.

Churchill became famous around the world after the last war with his two books, "The World Crisis" and "Marlborough's Journey". As for his role as the helmsman of the "Great Britain" during this war, leading this giant ship through terrifying storms and safely passing difficult sea voyages, it is even more valuable information for historians to describe with flourish; he deserves to be an outstanding reporter and a great statesman. Some people praise him as the only statesman and historian since Caesar, which is not an exaggeration. With his status as the decision-maker of the highest policy during the war, his rich historical materials, and his unique and famous Churchillian writing style, he will reveal the secrets of history, anecdotes, and history in his memoirs to the world. We sincerely hope to see Qiu Weng's great work.

### American Miscellany

— Xu Shuyuan

Idle Chat About the Link Trainer

The aviation association has ordered the next twenty Lincoln trainers, which we refer to as Link trainers using the abbreviation "Linker." The applied instruments of this type of aircraft are exactly the same as those of a real aircraft, except that the Link trainer flies on the ground, not in the air. Its appearance resembles a child's toy car, the kind most common in American amusement parks, which can withstand countless bumps without breaking. After a person learning on the Link trainer sits inside and closes the canopy, they are sealed inside, as if flying blindly, unable to see any outside scenery. The instructor gives flight instructions by telephone. This kind of training is the most economical and safe. Before the invention of the Link trainer, instructors would fly with students several times before letting them go solo (single flight), which was very dangerous, sacrificing countless lives, and the consumption of fuel and aircraft maintenance was also considerable. Since the introduction of the Link trainer, each unit costs only one thousand U.S. dollars, and any middle-class family can buy one to play with. To make it even more popular, amusement parks can also install them for the general public to practice with. When I was at the Air Force Gunnery School, there was Jim Hanrly practice in the curriculum, which was a game of shooting at airplanes on a screen with machine guns. It was quite ingeniously made. During practice, airplanes appeared on the screen, and you aimed and fired. If you hit, there was the sound of a bullet hitting; if you missed, there was no sound. To guide your aiming, the teacher would add a film showing a red circle moving in front of the airplane on the screen, and shooting at the red circle would hit the airplane. There was also equipment to count the hit rate, recording how many shots were fired and how many hits were made. In reality, no bullets were consumed, and the effect of practice was achieved. This kind of equipment used in amusement parks for children's shooting training is economical and safe. However, anything becomes a gambling tool when it comes to China. Do you see the shooting stalls on the roadside? If you hit the target, you get cigarettes, wine and candy. The purpose of the people shooting is to get cigarettes and candy, not to practice aiming.

Scientific Essays

### The Wonderful Life of Cockroaches (Part 2)

— Tianhong

Considering that humans and almost all other animals unanimously want to eliminate it, it is indeed a wonder that the cockroach still exists! Birds and cats all detest it; wasps, frogs, hedgehogs, birds, cats, and dogs all eat it when hungry, and kill it for entertainment when bored. Humans are constantly using the most advanced and effective insecticides to deal with it, yet the cockroach still exists.

The cockroach has a strong and sturdy body to resist its persecutors. Although it is pot-bellied, it is a very capable athlete. When it unleashes its six legs to run, even the most famous runners cannot catch up with it. In case of emergencies, it can fully open its "engine" and fly away to escape danger. It can also shrink its body and hide in narrow cracks or crevices.

Speaking of eyes! The cockroach's vision has the greatest advantages of "red light" and "radar" and has existed for hundreds of millions of years. Its compound eyes, composed of more than 1,800 facets, can see clearly without any difficulty. It can see a small piece of food even in a very narrow crack.

You can submerge it underwater for twenty minutes without harming it at all!

It also has the amazing ability to regenerate limbs. If it sticks its nose where it shouldn't and gets it cut off, it will grow a bigger—perhaps better—nose in a few days. Many records can prove that if a cockroach's leg is cut off, it will grow back.

The cockroach's intelligence is no less astonishing than its physical strength. Compared to crickets, it can simply be called a genius. Crickets chirp incessantly, letting enemies know their location and endangering their own lives. Cockroaches, however, do not make a sound—so they are much safer.

When dealing with problems, cockroaches' solutions are also more clever than those of other insects. For example, an ant encounters two pieces of food—one is delicious but too big to drag, and the other is light but not tasty—it will drag the delicious one away, groaning under the heavy burden. If it were a cricket, it would spend a lot of time eating both pieces. But what about the cockroach? It will eat the heavy piece on the spot and take the small piece back.

This kind of ingenuity can explain why cockroaches have multiplied beyond all other animals, large and small, from prehistoric times, and why "paleontologists" sometimes call the "Carboniferous Period," more than 200 million years ago, the "Age of Cockroaches."

Cockroaches are extremely capable navigators, so their traces can be found all over the world. When the Greeks sailed overseas for expeditions, cockroaches hid in the cabins and conquered new lands with them. In the "New World," they were also among the earliest immigrants.

Russian farmers firmly believe that "Prussian" cockroaches, mixed with wine, can cure edema. Many epicures have claimed that "raw cockroaches" taste good, and that powdered cockroaches can be made into delicious sauces. Not long ago, the American health authorities discovered that a certain brand of leaf extract sold in "Philadelphia," a very cultured city, contained cockroach ingredients.

Although I have praised the merits of cockroaches so much, I also know that they can spread dangerous diseases, so we must strive to eliminate them!
