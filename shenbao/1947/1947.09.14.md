[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] President Chiang delivered a speech lasting approximately one hour at the third session of the Fourth Plenary Session at 5 PM on the 13th. Everyone present was moved by his earnest and passionate address. After his speech, the entire venue responded with enthusiastic applause, which lasted for a long time. The gist of the President's address was as follows: The unified organization of the Party and the Youth League is a major action in the Party's revolutionary history. The harmonious atmosphere, sense of responsibility, understanding of the overall situation, and clear understanding of the great principles, disregarding personal status and rights, and sacrificing preconceptions at this meeting, truly moved me. Even the revolutionary martyrs would surely be comforted. This is truly a great achievement of our Party. However, after the unified organization of the Party and the Youth League, the Party's responsibility is great, and the responsibility of the Central Committee members is particularly significant. Therefore, I especially hope that everyone will concentrate their efforts, strengthen unity, to complete the following important tasks: (1) Complete the task of suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion, implement the general mobilization order, and all Party members should be models for the national people. (2) Party members should fulfill their minimum obligations to the Party, must pay Party dues, and Party departments at all levels must handle this conscientiously. (3) Comrades should earnestly research laws and regulations based on the political program and policies, respect laws and regulations, and implement laws and regulations. (4) We should complete the work of building a new China with a spirit of self-reliance. Party departments and members at all levels should pay special attention to the politics, economy, education, and construction of the recovered areas, making them experimental zones of the Principle of People's Livelihood.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The closing ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session was held in an extremely harmonious atmosphere at 6 PM on the 13th. The President, radiant and beaming, fully displayed his satisfaction and joy at the successful conclusion of the meeting. In his short closing remarks, the President, in addition to praising the achievements of the meeting, emphasized the importance of self-reliance in stabilizing social order and establishing an economic foundation. Regarding the transformation of the Party, the President instructed: A. The spiritual transformation should be pragmatic, self-disciplined, frugal, loving, respectful, knowing shame, trustworthy, and harmonious. B. The transformation of action requires the establishment of cadre education, the establishment of cadre policies, and the mobilization of young people to engage in social movements. We should not be afraid of the Communists. The Communists are destroyers of history and society. Their communism is nothing but deceiving themselves. Finally, the President declared again: The urgent tasks at present are: (1) To conduct a general registration of party members; (2) Party fees should be borne by party members themselves, and a party fee fundraising committee should be established. At the same time, to rescue and provide preferential treatment to the families of deceased martyrs, a public fundraising committee should be prepared; (4) Student movement guidance committees should be organized in large cities where schools are located; (4) Party members should go to the front lines to serve, and the party's organizational changes are significant and should be transferred.

### Full Text of Declaration

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and the Joint Conference of the Central Party and Youth League is as follows:

Since the founding of the Kuomintang by the President to lead the National Revolution, what we have inherited is the historical mission of China. Whenever the nation and the people entrust the party with a major historical mission, the Party will have a new review, a new unity, to form a new formation to undertake this new mission.

Before the founding of the Republic of China, the President reorganized the Revive China Society into the Revolutionary Alliance. As a result, the Republic of China was born. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang was reorganized into the Chinese Revolutionary Party. As a result, Yuan Shikai's monarchy was overthrown and peace was rebuilt. In the thirteenth year, the Chinese Kuomintang was reorganized. As a result, warlords were eliminated and the great cause of the Northern Expedition's unification was completed. In the twenty-seventh year, the various major decisions of the Party's Provisional National Congress and the establishment of the Three Principles of the People Youth League gloriously achieved the victory of more than eight years of arduous resistance against Japan. Now, history has entrusted the Party with the great responsibility of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation after World War II. Therefore, the Party has decided to unify the Party and Youth League organization. This measure follows the President's past experience in improving revolutionary organizations, uniting comrades, concentrating forces, unifying command, rebuilding the foundation of the revolution, strengthening the Party's ideological leadership, and promoting the Party's revolutionary spirit, in order to jointly accomplish this extraordinary and arduous task and achieve the tasks of the later revolution.

The history of the past fifty years shows us that the Party has overthrown autocracy, established the Republic of China, eliminated warlords, abolished unequal treaties, and completed the major historical events such as the victory of the War of Resistance. For the principles of nationalism and democracy, these are obviously major achievements. Over the years, the establishment of people's representative organs at all levels, and the recent promulgation of the Constitution and the end of political tutelage, are sufficient to show the Party's consistent efforts and continuous progress in order to complete democratic politics with determination and sincerity. Suppressing the rebellion and general mobilization is to maintain the unity and integrity of the country's territorial sovereignty, which is a key to national survival and world peace. As for the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, it was originally the main purpose of the Party's revolution. Relieving the suffering of the people's lives is an urgent need at present. In the past, there were originally fewer achievements in the construction of people's livelihood. The eight years of war and the post-war devastation and destruction have made it even more incomplete. Therefore, the economic construction of the Principle of People's Livelihood should be restarted and cannot be delayed. All construction undertakings should first of all do their best. The Party is willing to take this as the goal of its current efforts and struggle.

We recognize the difficulties of the current revolutionary environment, but we must also recognize that our revolutionary power is stronger than any previous revolutionary stage. In the past, our weak revolutionary forces were still able to overcome the difficulties of each stage. From now on, as long as we are self-respecting but not arrogant, self-reflecting but not discouraged, self-confident but not complacent, we will definitely be able to protect ourselves through historical precedent and achieve our expected goals.

We must understand that those who cannot be self-reliant and strive for improvement are not revolutionary political parties, and those who cannot withstand slander and cannot endure suffering are not revolutionary party members. We are willing to promote the Party's rebirth with the Party's unity and struggle, to create the driving force of the revolution with the Party's rebirth, and to achieve a comprehensive reform of politics and economy with the driving force of the revolution.

We appreciate the ancient Chinese saying two thousand years ago that "governing is not about talking a lot, but about how well you carry it out." From now on, we are willing to answer expectations with facts and prove our determination with action.

We must not hesitate to sacrifice to protect the survival of the nation, strive for the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, and work hard to improve the people's lives.

The country has moved towards the era of constitutionalism, but the responsibility of protecting the Republic of China and safeguarding the Chinese nation is the Party and its comrades' inescapable duty. We are willing to encourage ourselves with this and encourage each other, and we are more willing for our compatriots across the country to share our common national concept and national consciousness, to join hands with us, and to jointly build our new China of the Three Principles of the People.

To all officers and soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army: After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Communists took advantage of the post-war devastation to disrupt peace and launch a full-scale rebellion. The government, in order to save the lives of the people and protect their survival, issued a clear order to mobilize to suppress the rebellion. Our officers and soldiers, after eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, continue to serve on the frontiers, risking their lives, bravely killing the enemy. We deeply appreciate your hard work and extend our sincere appreciation.

### Xie Shou Kang Travels from France to the United States, Expected to Return Home in November

[Our Newspaper, Paris, 30th Airmail] Pope Pius XII recently personally inscribed a large photograph with upper and lower inscriptions to Mrs. Yuan Tigan, the mother-in-law of Dr. Xie Shou Kang, the former Chinese envoy to the Vatican, in appreciation of Xie's past efforts to promote relations between China and the Vatican.

### Bao Sui Department Major General Senior Staff Officer Yuan Chonggu Embezzles Enemy Property, Military-Official Inspection Group Breaks Case Based on Tip-Off

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 13th] The Military-Official Inspection Group has broken another major case. Yuan Chonggu, a senior staff officer of the Bao Sui Department, and Zhao Yingda, the leader of the third group of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, have been arrested. Yuan Chonggu came to Beiping after the victory and held this position. He had previously embezzled three enemy-owned houses in the names of He Wanghui, valued at over 50 gold bars. Recently, the inspection group secretly investigated and found that these three houses were all properties of the Japanese Toyo Textile Company. One of the houses was purchased in the name of He Wanghui through forgery. Yuan claimed that He Wanghui was his wife and purchased the property during the occupation period (Year 28 of the Republic of China). It was later forcibly occupied by the Japanese, and he requested the Handling Bureau to return it. The Handling Bureau returned it as requested. After the inspection group learned of the inside story based on a tip-off, it sent police and military police today to arrest Yuan. Yuan resisted arrest, claiming that He Wanghui was his first wife and had returned to his hometown of Binjiang in Northeast China, and that his current wife was "Anti-Japanese wife" Zhuang Youqing, thus determining that the so-called He Wanghui was not a real person. The inspection group believes that the Handling Bureau's "return" of enemy property in this way is highly suspected of corruption and dereliction of duty, so it sent Yuan to the military law office of the Xingyuan for prosecution and simultaneously sent Zhao Yingda to the court.

### Two Demons Arrested in the Nanjing Massacre Case

Will Be Handed Over by Japan to Nanjing and Shenyang for Interrogation

[Central News Agency, Our City] When the Japanese army invaded the capital in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese commander Tani Hisao allowed his subordinates to massacre our innocent people, which was extremely tragic. At that time, some Japanese soldiers used the massacre as a competition, and two lieutenants set the highest record for killing people, one killing 106 people and the other killing 105 people, truly demons among humans. The Japanese army was proud of this, and the Japanese newspapers greatly publicized it and published their photos. After the efforts of our military delegation stationed in Japan, the two demons, Noda Tsuyoshi and Mukai Toshiaki, were finally arrested in Tokyo and will be sent to Nanjing for public trial.

### Authoritative Sources Discuss the Peace Treaty with Japan: Attention Should Be Paid to Voting Methods; "Four Power Consent" is the Most Appropriate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] On the 13th, a certain authoritative source, in a casual conversation with a reporter regarding the Japanese peace treaty, stated that regarding the voting rights at the peace conference, we should firmly insist on maintaining the original proposal of the United Nations Charter, namely the consent of the four major powers, or the so-called right of veto by one nation. It is claimed that: the peace treaty with Japan concerns our country's recent development and future survival to a greater extent than any other nation. If there is even one clause or item in the treaty that hinders our country's development or endangers our country's survival, we cannot agree. Without our country's consent, the peace treaty cannot be established. The two-thirds voting system proposed by the United States and endorsed by the British Canberra Conference violates the United Nations Charter. Secondly, our country is weak and isolated, unlike the many countries of the British and American blocs. We must guard against the possibility that the nations participating in the peace conference, due to differing interests and a lack of concern, will vote in a manner detrimental to our country. In order to uphold the Charter and protect our interests, we should not shy away from seeming to align with the Soviet Union and firmly advocate for the consent of the four major powers, that is, the right of veto by one nation. As for the rumored proposal by our country to amend the American suggestion to "a two-thirds voting system but with the consent of the three major powers," that is also too risky. In the event that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, due to aligned interests, were to sacrifice our country, wouldn't we be hoist by our own petard? To cite a real-world example, we advocate setting Japan's industrial level at the standard of 1928 to 1930, while the Soviet Union advocates for the standard of 1930 to 1934, which aligns with the American position. Therefore, we must not make such a risky suggestion. Furthermore, the source also advocated that we should firmly advocate for the abolition of the Japanese Emperor system and that, regarding Japanese territory, we should insist on delineating its mainland territory according to the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement. As for the islands near the mainland, the maximum extent should be the islands over which the MacArthur Headquarters stipulated Japan's exercise of administrative power in its order of January 29, 1946. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, the source believes that the Pauley reparations plan should be the minimum.

The Communist bandits' countermeasure is to use one column in coordination with four newly formed divisions and five or six independent regiments to gradually ambush the National Army. At the same time, they are thoroughly destroying roads and burying many mines in an attempt to impede the army's advance. Therefore, the National Army is advancing steadily and cautiously, gradually advancing according to the pre-determined plan.

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 13th] In Southwestern Shandong, the battles in the areas of Yuncheng, Juye, Liangshan, Hongchuankou, and Wanglaohu are intensifying. Chen Yi's remaining main force, after a month and a half of reorganization, has once again gathered as many as six columns here. In order to protect the safety of Liu Bocheng's troops after their southward retreat and to contain the National Army's offensive in Jiaodong, the Communist bandits have been coordinating with two regiments of local forces originally lurking and scattered south of Jiaxiang and two regiments north and south of Cao County to launch a fairly extensive disruptive offensive against the National Army in recent days. After three days of reinforcement and interception by the National Army, the total losses of the bandits have reached 15,000. As of the morning of the 13th, the National Army is taking advantage of the victory to press towards the bandits.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] A fierce annihilation battle is currently underway in the Yuncheng, Juye, and Heze triangle area.

The National Army is currently searching for and annihilating them. Several thousand bandits who attacked Jiangchang are fleeing one after another. The situation in Wuwu is unclear. After Tongcheng was lost, Qianshan is in a state of emergency.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 13th] The National Army advancing eastward on the Henan-Anhui border encountered the 17th and 18th regiments of the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Column of bandits at Zhanglaopu (southeast of Gushi) on the 12th and completely annihilated them.

### Full Text of Minister Bai's Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session (Continued 2)

(5) Improvement of Conscription Facilities: Conscription is normally a matter of domestic affairs in other countries, but in our country it is still a major military and political priority, as well as a matter of close relations between this Ministry and the people. This Ministry has paid special attention to it. The improvements regarding conscription work and the "Improvement of Conscription Facilities During the Period of Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion" are outlined below: (1) Revision of Conscription Laws and Regulations: 233 types of laws and regulations have been revised and consolidated into 24 types to form a systematic and complete set of conscription laws and regulations. (2) Adjustment of Conscription Agencies: In April of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), all old division garrison districts were abolished in preparation for the establishment of several new division garrison districts and regiment garrison districts. As of the end of August this year, 57 division garrison districts and 181 regiment garrison districts have been established, excluding bandit areas. The original 17 military garrison districts have been increased by two, the Jiangsu-Shandong Military Garrison Districts, for a total of 19. (3) Improvement of Garrison District Personnel: A conscription research class has been established at the Central Training Corps, which has held three sessions, graduating a total of 626 general- and colonel-level students who have been assigned to garrison districts to take on senior work. (4) Conscription Situation: The average allocation ratio is 1.5 per thousand of the population. (5) Implementation of Normal Conscription: The standard is to conscript those who have reached the age of twenty. If this is not enough, the age range will be extended, but not exceeding twenty-five. Except for special areas and special forces, unauthorized recruitment is strictly prohibited. (6) Due to the large number of exemptions and deferments in major cities, volunteers are conscripted first, and then conscription is carried out if this is not enough. (7) Conscription fees have been increased to 30,000 yuan per person, and settlement allowance is 50,000 yuan per person, and local fundraising for preferential treatment funds and grain has been launched. (8) Barracks are either repaired or built by various garrison districts and local governments, or ancestral halls and temples are used, and sleeping in the open and forcibly occupying civilian houses is prohibited. (9) New recruits are distributed clothing according to quotas, and competitions for officer-soldier care and denunciation of abuse are implemented. As a result, this year's conscription has been smooth, with 99% of the quota being conscripted, and the proportion of deserters and illnesses en route is less than 2%.

(6) Establishment of Second-Line Army Corps: In accordance with the General Mobilization Order, in addition to strengthening the first-line army corps, it is still necessary to actively establish second-line army corps. Measures have been drafted and are being implemented separately.

(7) Strengthening of Local Self-Defense Weapons: This Ministry has always attached great importance to cultivating local armed forces. As of June this year, weapons have been allocated to local teams and police in various provinces across the country, including rifles, light and heavy machine guns, and other handheld machine guns, pistols, grenade launchers, mortars, etc., in large numbers. The principle of allocation is to make full use of civilian firearms by the people's self-defense forces in various regions as much as possible, and to allocate ammunition and captured weapons according to their actual needs. The weapons for the security teams in each province are allocated to the extent that they meet the authorized strength. In fact, weapons have already been fully allocated in important provinces, and more than 60% have been filled in secondary provinces. A review has been conducted and a replenishment plan has been formulated, which is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.

(8) Distribution of Japanese Warships: Since the surrender of Japan, all Japanese warships have been disarmed by the Allied forces. Among them, battleships, aircraft carriers, and submarines have been sunk by the United States. Those below destroyers were divided equally among China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and the allocation was determined by drawing lots. China received eight ships each in the first, second, and third batches, for a total of 24 ships. However, the Japanese warships received this time were mostly produced during the war, and their structures were relatively simple. All weapons and telecommunications equipment were completely destroyed when Japan surrendered. Some have been repaired and completed, and some are still under renovation. As soon as they are completed, they will be formed into squadrons and put into service. C. Promotion of Institutions

Institutions are the foundation of army building, a major plan for centuries. Although the focus is currently on suppressing bandits, we have not neglected the future, so we are still paying attention to establishing institutions and intensifying their promotion to lay a permanent foundation for the national army. The following are a few important points:

(1) Personnel System: The reform of the personnel system is aimed at coordinating with the reorganization of the army to suppress rebellion, eliminating old habits, in order to improve the quality of national army cadres and increase the combat power of the national army. The following is recorded: 1. Layered Responsibility: In the past, all official performance evaluations, awards, and punishments in the national army were handled centrally by the Military Affairs Commission. Although the control was strict, the assessment was difficult. After the establishment of this Ministry, in order to be realistic and strengthen the responsibilities and powers of each level, a layered responsibility system was adopted. The Measures for the Division of Responsibilities for the Personnel Work of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were formulated. This Ministry only controls the allocation of personnel and positions, as well as the appointment, dismissal, assessment, and rewards of generals. The transfer and assessment of personnel below the rank of colonel are authorized to the commanders-in-chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as the directors of the Headquarters and the pacification commissioners, to be handled and reported for record. In addition, the retirement system is the most effective way to maintain the vigor of the army. It not only allows the cadres at all levels of the active military to constantly metabolize and improve their quality and morale, but also reserves a large number of reserve officers, making it easier to replenish them in wartime. Therefore, after the establishment of this Ministry, it overcame all difficulties and strived to implement this good system. (End of incomplete)

Weekly Forum

### "Today" and "China"

— Xu Weinan

Mr. Hu Pu'an often advocated a slogan in his later years: "Stand on the point of today to read ancient Chinese books; stand on the point of China to read foreign books!"

He often mentioned this slogan in conversations and also wrote it in his articles. This was a result of his seventy years of research and contemplation.

My association with Elder Pu was relatively long, and we got along very well. Ultimately, this was only because of our shared thoughts. And the core of our thinking, it can be said, is the slogan he advocated above.

This slogan of his is about how to read. The meaning of reading is originally very broad. If we put it more abstractly, we can say: "Stand at the forefront of the times to study inherent academic thoughts and cultural systems; stand on the nation's standpoint to study world trends and the cultural systems of various countries." If we say it this way, it can be generally applied and become a proposition. This is Mr. Hu's proposition, and also our proposition.

Currently, when scholars in general express their views on the relationship between the times and the nation, they often fail to make balanced arguments and lean towards one extreme: those who emphasize the times kick aside the nation, and those who emphasize the nation discard the times. In reality, the relationship between the times and the nation is like a cross, and we live at the intersection of this cross: we can neither abandon the nation nor cast aside the times.

(II)

Mr. Hu said in his "Pu'anism" article: "Stand on the point of the present to read ancient books, and constantly and in everything reflect on oneself and put it into practice. The Doctrine of the Mean in the Book of Rites says, 'Above, Zhongni (Confucius) revered Yao and Shun, and modeled themselves on King Wen and King Wu; above, they followed the seasons of Heaven; below, they conformed to the waters and lands.' To revere Yao and Shun is to uphold the morality of sages; to model themselves on King Wen and King Wu is to follow the laws of the nation; to follow the seasons of Heaven is to know the existence of time; to conform to the waters and lands is to know the existence of space. To uphold morality while following the laws prevents one from becoming a pedant; to follow the laws while upholding morality prevents one from becoming a harsh legalist. To exist in space while knowing the existence of time prevents one from becoming an ancient person in modern China; to remember space while existing in time prevents one from becoming a foreigner in modern China."

The last two sentences are the most insightful and hit the nail on the head. Now, let's first focus on the point of time and explain it further.

Time is like an unbreakable line that stretches infinitely. The present is contained within the past, and the past is left behind in the present. However, human life evolves step by step with the progress of the times. Initially, it was the Stone Age, then the Bronze Age, then the Iron Age, and now we are applying atoms. In the Stone Age, stone tools were originally the best sharp weapons. Reading about the stone tools of the Stone Age is perfectly fine; but if we feel that the stone tools of the Stone Age are already perfect and don't want bronze tools, iron tools, or even atoms, then that is a big mistake. Because we have already progressed to the stage of atoms today, stone tools can only become antiques in museums and can no longer be used as sharp weapons. All academic systems, thoughts, and arts, although different from tools, also progress with the times. No matter how wonderful the academic systems, thoughts, and arts of the past are, because of the evolution of the times, there will always be aspects that are not suitable for the times. Anything that is no longer suitable for the times should be discarded and need not be retained. Unfortunately, most people who read ancient books accept the contents of ancient books unconditionally and want to apply everything in ancient books to the present, which is a big mistake. Mr. Pu'an, in his article on Confucian self-cultivation methods, taught people the method of reading: "When learning from books, start with doubt. There are two doubts: first, doubt the book; second, doubt the principle. To doubt the book is to doubt errors in the editions or errors in the records. To doubt the principle is to doubt misunderstandings in interpretations and changes in the times."

His advocacy of standing on the point of the present to read ancient books is to tell people who read ancient books not to forget what era it is now and to accept everything in ancient books without any criticism or selection. Ancient books should be read, they must be read. Without reading ancient books, one would not know the traces of our country and society, or the path of development of thought and scholarship. However, one must wear the glasses of the times when reading ancient books, and stand in the present to criticize the strengths and weaknesses of ancient cultural systems, etc., in order to make choices and adopt them for today's use. Moreover, in the past, China was closed off, and the country's academic thoughts could still reliably control the country through the power of tradition; now that communication is developed and the world is a family, the academic thoughts, cultural systems, etc. of various countries in the world are pouring in, and it is impossible to resist them. Therefore, to read ancient Chinese books from the point of today, to put it in more detail, is to compare the academic thoughts of various countries in the world today with Chinese academic thoughts: see which kinds of Chinese academic thoughts are no longer suitable for today, and put them aside; which kinds are still superior to others and are extremely applicable to today, then make great efforts to promote and develop them. In short: time is urging China to modernize, and readers must also modernize, and by no means become people in books and turn into ancient people in modern China.

(III)

Time is urging China to modernize, which is undoubtedly true. However, "modernization" is not equal to "foreignization" — neither "Sovietization" nor "Americanization" nor "Britishization." On the contrary, it is to select and absorb all the modern cultural systems, etc. of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and other countries in the world to suit the environment and history of the Chinese nation. In other words, it is to absorb modern cultural systems, academic thoughts that are suitable for China for one's own use, and transform them into "Chinese" cultural systems and academic thoughts. However, those who talk about modernization today often forget this principle. Seeing the success of the United States, they want to move everything from the United States to China for implementation, regardless of whether it is good or bad. It is only a pity that the Chinese moon can never become the American moon. Seeing the success of the Soviet Union, they want to move everything from the Soviet Union to small countries for implementation, drinking vodka, carrying the signboard of Gorky, and wearing embroidered shirts, they still feel that they are not Sovietized enough, and they only want Nanjing to become Insk and Shanghai weather to be as cold as Leningrad. As a result, in schools and on the streets, we only see Chinese people whose souls have entered the Soviet or American nationality, and not a single real Chinese person. As a result, because the democracy of the Soviet Union is different from the democracy of Britain and the United States, our compatriots with Soviet nationality are waging war on the battlefield, and in the rear, in publications and at meetings, they are also desperately engaging in "theoretical struggles," pre-determining a set of theories to forcibly install future facts. The fierceness of the battle is beyond description, but these "foreigners in modern China" die without realizing it, even die without regret!

If today's China, everyone can exist in space while knowing the existence of time, not becoming ancient people in modern China; remember space while existing in time, not becoming foreigners in modern China, everyone becomes a modern Chinese person, a modern person in China; then the internal chaos in today's China can certainly be calmed down immediately, all modern construction in China can certainly be carried out immediately, and the realm of peace and happiness will certainly begin to enter China immediately!

### Amidst Calls for Preliminary Peace Talks with Japan, the Japanese Prime Minister Clarifies His Position, Requests the Current Cabinet to Attend the Peace Conference, and Hopes that All Eleven Allied Nations Will Participate in the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty

[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama declared on the 13th that his Socialist cabinet is prepared to attend the peace conference as a true representative of the Japanese people, and requests that all countries show trust in Japan's efforts toward democratization. Katayama, who assumed the position of Prime Minister on June 1st, held his first press conference today. He stated, "We will do our best to make Japan a democratic country. What we are concerned about is the future of Japan, not the mistakes of Japan's past, but we will prohibit all actions that could easily cause misunderstanding by other countries." He stated that the government will strive to select a delegation of representatives who understand new democratic methods, have the trust of labor, and are deeply aware of the social and cultural problems of Japan, to participate in the peace conference. The current situation has not yet reached the time to select this delegation. However, at the end of the press conference, Cabinet Secretary-General Nishio, who holds an important position in the Socialist Party, was designated by Prime Minister Katayama as the natural candidate to represent Japan at the peace conference. Nishio stated that the delegation should provide assurances "not to cause any more disputes and not to provoke war again." He also said that the Socialist Party does not oppose including opposition party candidates in the delegation, but insists that the Katayama cabinet itself is the most reasonable choice. Katayama smiled and said that Nishio's nomination of him was quite unexpected, but he would reserve comment on the matter for the time being. Katayama acknowledged hearing rumors of the formation of a new conservative party, the purpose of which is to deal with the peace conference, but he believed it was not necessary. Although he did not name names, he was clearly referring to former Prime Minister Yoshida. Katayama stated that he would not attend the peace conference if China did not participate, and he did not want to comment on the news of separate peace treaties. He only stated, "China and Japan are neighboring countries with historical interrelationships, and China will naturally have a deep understanding of Japan."

He stated that he and his government have not yet made recommendations to the Allied nations regarding the minimum conditions required for Japan's peaceful era. He is not prepared to discuss what form of control Japan will need after the peace treaty is signed. As for the treaty, Japan is not qualified to make suggestions, but is willing to abide by the actions of the Allied nations. He stated that the Japanese cabinet fervently hopes that the peace treaty can be signed by all eleven relevant countries.

At the same time, he released the following points regarding domestic affairs: (1) To achieve its black market control policy within three and a half months. He estimates that the number of black market operators has been reduced by one-third of the previous number. The government's emergency economic recovery plan has been effective, and prices are already showing a downward trend. (2) Thanks to Allied relief, the food situation has significantly improved. The government is formulating a new grain collection and main food distribution plan, to be implemented in November. (3) Regarding the final revision of the cabinet's economic concentration exclusion plan, it is scheduled to be passed by the cabinet on September 16th and submitted to parliament.

### Hitoshi Ashida Again Criticizes the Economic Policies of the Katayama Cabinet

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] The Japanese Democratic Party convened a policy research committee on the 12th, and also held a standing directors meeting. President Ashida, in view of the recent political trends unfavorable to Katayama, again used his speculative methods to re-express his attitude on various important issues: (1) On the issue of coal mine nationalization, which had already been passed in the cabinet meeting on the 5th, he now raises a major amendment on whether the nature of the council should be a decision-making body. (2) On the issue of long-term economic policy, he believes that according to Nishio's remarks, it is completely a socialist policy, which is contrary to the four-party policy agreement, and expresses absolute opposition.

### The U.S. Delegation Convenes a Meeting of the UN General Assembly, Marshall Directs Strategy, and Limiting the Veto Power of Major Powers Will Inevitably Be Opposed by the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, New York, 13th] Because the United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open next Tuesday, Secretary of State Marshall convened a series of meetings with his ten-member delegation today to decide on the policies that the United States should adopt on the issues of the Balkans, Palestine, and the veto power, and will formally appoint representatives to attend the various committees of the General Assembly. According to a U.S. spokesman, Marshall, with so many important issues, did not want to bear the burden alone in the political committee of 55 participating countries, and will appoint other representatives to participate in the discussion of various special issues. Seeing that Marshall has personally instructed the strategy here, it shows that the United States attaches great importance to this session of the UN General Assembly.

[U.S. News Agency, Lake Success, 12th] Marshall is preparing to speak twice next week. The first speech will be on Sunday night, for the National United Nations Celebration Week of the United Nations Association of the United States; the second will be on Wednesday to the regular session of the General Assembly. Marshall is expected to summarize the United States' policy toward the United Nations General Assembly in these two speeches, and the fact that Marshall is personally serving as the head of the U.S. delegation can also be seen as proof that the United States is strengthening its support for the United Nations after criticizing the slow action of the United Nations.

[Reuters, Moscow, 13th] Well-informed sources said that the Soviet Union will oppose any attempt to limit the veto power at this session of the UN General Assembly, and will condemn the United States' policies in Indonesia and Korea. Regarding the Korean part, the Soviet Union will submit a long document, based on Molotov's recent note to Marshall, accusing the U.S. authorities of destroying democratic elements. In addition, the Soviet Union will strongly support India's accusation of South Africa's discrimination against Indians.

### The United States Accuses the Soviet Union of Obstructing the Work of the Security Council

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The State Department released a white paper tonight on the United Nations organization and the Greek issue, accusing the Soviet Union of obstructing the clear will of the vast majority of the Security Council, and accusing Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia of delaying, undermining, and preventing the investigation work of the UN Balkan Committee, and engaging in affirmative encouragement and assistance to the guerrilla bands in Greece. The publication of this document, on the eve of the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Greek issue, is intended to reiterate the warning recently made by U.S. representative Johnson. Johnson had stated that the United States would use all means within the scope of the United Nations Charter to maintain international peace and provide protection to Greece.

### European Customs Union, The European Economic Conference Announces That It Will Begin Research Immediately, and the Soviet Union and Other Countries Will Also Be Invited to Participate

[United Press International, London, 12th] The European Economic Conference announced tonight that it will conduct research to establish a European customs union, in which the countries concerned will give up economic independence for the sake of common welfare. Tariffs should be abolished between the member countries of the union, complete free trade should be maintained, and a common tariff policy should be adopted towards countries outside the union. The Soviet Union and 15 other countries will also be invited to participate in the research work, which is the first attempt in Europe to make up for the East-West divide since the Eastern European bloc rejected the Marshall Plan.

The countries invited, in addition to the Soviet Union, include Belarus, Ukraine, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, and the Free Territory of Trieste. In addition, Sweden, Norway, and Switzerland have all attended the Paris Economic Conference, but have not yet participated in the customs union research group. Those who have already participated are the 13 countries of the European Economic Conference: Britain, France, Italy, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Portugal, Turkey, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Among them, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have already established a customs union, have considerable experience in this type of organization, and are willing to take on the role of initiator of the European Customs Union research body. When the proposal to organize a European Customs Union was first put forward in Paris, Britain did not commit itself. It is said that it is necessary to obtain the consent of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and Pakistan before deciding whether to participate or not.

### Britain Suggests Investigating the Number of Troops in Various Countries

[United Press International, Lake Success, 12th] British representative Cadogan today proposed in a secret meeting of the General Disarmament Committee that the existing military strength of various countries be investigated to establish international confidence. He stated that the British government felt that there were several major obstacles to the prospect of disarmament, but that preliminary measures could be taken.

### The Italian Left Again Raises a Motion of No Confidence in the Government, The Communist Party Seeks to Seize Italy for the Soviet Union

[United Press International, Rome, 12th] Italian left-wing leaders submitted their second motion of no confidence in the Gasperi government on the 12th, but again warned that if the domestic situation in Italy does not change, they will use force to overthrow the government of the Social Democratic Party.

[United Press International, Washington, 12th] Diplomats here declared today that the Italian Communist Party, under the direction of Moscow, has launched the "Battle for Italy." This battle has been waiting for an opportunity for a long time, and the crisis it will cause will make the U.S. aid plan too slow to help. The spread of the million-man labor tide of Italian farmers and workers, the Socialists' request for a vote of no confidence in the Gasperi government, and other recent developments all appear to be part of the Communist movement to overthrow the government and seize Italy for the Soviet Union. There is a very high possibility of civil war in Italy. The harsh conditions of the Italian peace treaty have caused deep unrest in the Italian political situation, and the future withdrawal of U.S. troops will have a great impact on the northeastern region of the country. The people of this region are forced by the provisions of the treaty to leave their hometowns and move into the new demilitarized zone, ceding to neighboring countries the territories they acquired after the First World War. The Communist Party claims to have concentrated its forces in the Po River Valley in northern Italy, making Italians more afraid of Yugoslavia.

### Latin America Opposes Aid to Europe

[Reuters, London, 12th] Unconfirmed reports say that Latin American representatives attending the annual meeting of the International Bank and Monetary Fund have decided to oppose continued loans to European countries, on the grounds that the European sixteen-country conference discussing the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe has extended its session, so none of the sixteen countries can be considered worth risking for. Latin American representatives neither confirmed nor denied the previous statement.

### Belgium and Australia Invite the United States to Participate in Mediating the Dispute between India and the Netherlands

Consular Conference to Be Held in Batavia

[United Press International, Lake Success, 13th] The three-nation committee mediating the dispute between India and the Netherlands has been designated by both India and the Netherlands as Australia and Belgium. The two countries are currently selecting the third country, and the United States is the most promising candidate. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt had a long talk with the Belgian representative on the evening of the 12th, reportedly to discuss inviting the United States to participate in the mediation committee.

[United Press International, Batavia, 13th] British Consul Lambert in Batavia, Australian Consul Eaton, Chinese Consul-General Jiang Jiadong, and Belgian Consul-General Van der Stichelen have all returned to Batavia after inspecting the Dutch military zone.

### Several European and Asian Countries Purchasing Military Equipment from the US

[United Press International, Boston, 12th] Mr. Johnson, General Manager of the Owen Machine Company, the largest automatic weapons factory in the United States, revealed on the 12th that several foreign government agencies are currently in contact with the United States to purchase weapons. He has concluded meetings with agencies from Europe, the Near East, and the Far East. Johnson also stated that the Soviet Union has decided to attempt to control all of Asia and Europe, while the United States and Britain, and perhaps other countries, are convinced that the Soviet Union does not intend to control Asia and Europe. Soviet intrusion can only be prevented by each country strengthening its armed forces and resisting with organized and planned efforts.

[United Press International, Washington, 12th] The State Department is maintaining a rather calm attitude regarding the rumored negotiations between several foreign governments and the United States for the purchase of large quantities of military equipment. According to a spokesperson, the Department's Munitions Control Board has absolute control over all exports of weapons or ammunition from the United States. Each time a munitions dealer wishes to export any war weapons to a foreign government, the exported weapons items must be cleared by the Board. There are no fixed regulations for arms export control; each case is considered individually. The export permits issued by the Board to munitions dealers are valid for one shipment only. Before making such a decision, consultation with the Army and Navy departments is required to seek their views on whether they have any objections to a particular country obtaining the weapons.

### Soviet Troops Demonstrate on Northern Iranian Border, Friction with Britain and the US over Oil Rights

[Reuters, Tehran, 12th] Since the American Ambassador to Iran, Mr. Allen, expressed the United States' determination to support Iran against threats to its natural resources, including oil fields, it is reported that Soviet troops have intensified exercises along the Soviet-Iranian border. Visitors from northern Iran say that the sounds of Soviet tanks and intense machine gun fire can be heard from within Soviet territory at the border. It is now learned that three battalions of Iranian mechanized forces have been dispatched to the northern border area to stand guard. It should be noted that although the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement was signed in April of last year, it still awaits ratification by the Iranian parliament before it can take effect. When the agreement was signed, Soviet troops were still stationed in the Azerbaijan province of northern Iran. It is rumored that Iranian Prime Minister Sultanana intends to amend the agreement before submitting it to parliament for ratification.

[United Press International, London, 12th] Well-informed sources in diplomatic circles here state that Britain is prepared to consider making economic concessions to Iran in order to prevent the Soviet Union from carrying out political or economic encroachment in order to secure Iranian oil.

### A Group of Daughters Head to Serve in the Military, Detained at Xiaguan Station, Fifth Army Recruitment in Shanghai and Hangzhou Reveals Doubts

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Peng Bolun, who claimed to be the secretary of the Fifth Army's Press Office, recruited over twenty female political workers in Shanghai and Hangzhou. At 7:15 AM on the 13th, they arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai and were detained at Xiaguan Station by the police and military police. The military police who carried out the inspection stated, "All military unit recruitment personnel must submit their credentials for approval by the Ministry of National Defense, but Mr. Peng was unable to produce such documentation." The military police detained Mr. Peng, and all the female students were sent to the Dahua Hotel for temporary accommodation. Among them, Wang Yanqing, Luo Yi, Wu Zhi, Shi [blank space], Wang Reina, and the other twenty-two who were Su Lvhua, Wang Peixiong, Zhu Youan, Li [blank space] Zhen, Zhu Fen, Qu Youwang, Chen Yaqing, Zhu Danping, Wang Yaxiong, Luo Jianshen, Zhao Hua, Meng Ying, Wang Ruijun, Wu Jingzhi, Lin Shuqing, Zhou Jingqiu, Zhuang Ying, Yu Hua, Du Xuming, Wang Lizhen, Zhu Jinling, Li Yu, those five who were in Shanghai were all the ones applying in Shanghai while the other twenty-two were the ones applying in Hangzhou. They were all young women around the age of twenty, most of whom were studying in middle school or were unemployed. When the reporter met them at the station, Peng Bolun, the leader, was being questioned by the police and military police. They were also gathered separately, discussing the suspicions they had encountered along the way. The reporter then interviewed several of them individually, asking about their reasons for applying and the process they had undergone. According to them, the biggest factor in their application was curiosity. At the same time, they all felt that it was a rare opportunity to go to work on the front lines, and it was explained during the recruitment that the training period before work would not exceed two months. Even within a month, if they felt that their life and work were not suitable, they could ask for leave to return home midway. If the work was suitable, they could continue working. On the recruitment booklet held by Peng Bolun, it was written that they were recruiting "Fifth Army News and Medical Personnel." They also said that there were many categories when applying, such as rural teaching, drama, music, medical care, etc., and they all applied according to their interests. Some of them expressed dissatisfaction with the suspicious attitudes of people along the way, believing that they were a formal organization, but they were constantly being obstructed and subjected to troublesome inquiries. Others expressed gratitude, as they themselves did not understand the plan for the future. According to the military police escorting them from Shanghai to Nanjing, their families were unwilling to let them leave when they boarded the train, which clearly indicated that there were still questions about the matter.

Recruitment Process in Shanghai and Hangzhou

[Our Newspaper] The Fifth Army Press Office recruited news and medical personnel in Shanghai and Hangzhou last month. It was stipulated that unmarried women aged seventeen to thirty were eligible, and more than one hundred people went to report for the exam at one time. In the end, twenty-seven female students were admitted in Hangzhou and five female students were admitted in Shanghai, all of whom were young women aged about eighteen or nineteen. However, during the recruitment period, because they had not obtained contact with the local government, many of the female students' families opposed it afterward because they did not understand the truth, so many female students withdrew one after another.

Until the night before last, the above-mentioned twenty-seven female students from Hangzhou arrived in Shanghai by night train, and then transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai No. 12 night train to Nanjing. At that time, they were led by a military officer wearing a "Shanxi Security" symbol, who claimed to be Peng Bolun. Because the Railway Police Department and the Military Police Corps did not know about this in advance, they paid close attention along the way. When they arrived in Nanjing yesterday morning, the Military Police Corps inquired and found that the documents were insufficient, so they detained the persons in charge, Peng Bolun, Gu Yuxiang, Huang Zhaohua and the female students.

### Leader Impersonating

After the military and police authorities investigated with the Fifth Army, it was heard that this was indeed the case, but because the person in charge, Peng Bolun, entrusted others to handle the recruitment in Shanghai and Hangzhou, there were many discrepancies in the procedures. The personnel who were entrusted were mostly unfamiliar with the situation of the Fifth Army, and in order to obtain convenience in action after the event, the leaders in Shanghai and Hangzhou impersonated Peng Bolun to carry out activities externally, so that when the military police inquired, there were many inconsistencies between the words and the facts, which caused people to have doubts.

The military officer Peng Bolun who led the female students to Nanjing in Shanghai, as was learned after investigation, was actually impersonated by a person named Gu Wangxiang, because Peng Bolun himself had already taken a train back to Beijing the night before. It is heard that after this incident occurred, the Shanghai side investigated and learned that when recruiting in Shanghai, the Fifth Army had sent an official letter to the Shanghai Branch of the Youth League, entrusting it to assist in the process. However, the military police believe that at this time of national general mobilization to suppress the rebellion, if various agencies have similar enrollment events, it seems necessary to obtain close cooperation with the local government in advance, otherwise, if there is no organization, there is a risk of breeding malpractices.

### Jin Tide Case Upholds Original Verdict, Yang Anren Detained for Execution

[Our Newspaper] In the Jin Tide case, which shocked the country, Yang Anren, the former deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Zhan Liansheng, the chairman of the Gold Industry Association, were previously sentenced by the District Court in accordance with the Regulations for Punishing Corruption. Yang Anren was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, and Zhan Liansheng was sentenced to four years imprisonment. Yang and Zhan refused to accept the verdict and filed a petition with the High Court for a retrial. After deliberation by the joint court of the Criminal Division Chief Xiao Bianfen and Judges Ding Suhong and Han Shuzhi, the original verdict was approved. The defendant Zhan Liansheng had already been detained in the District Court Detention Center. Yang Anren was allowed to be released on bail during the appeal period. Now that the case has been judged by the High Court, the High Court notified the District Court to execute the verdict the day before yesterday afternoon. The Chief of the District Court sent a confidential letter to the District Procuratorate. In the afternoon of the same day, the Chief Clerk of the District Procuratorate led bailiffs to No. 18, Lane 131, Changshu Road, to arrest Yang Anren. After a brief questioning about his age and case details, he was detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center. The original text of the High Court's judgment is very long. The reasons for upholding the original verdict are that Yang and Lu had used their positions to collude for fraud and directly benefit themselves. It said: "It was found that in early February of this year, the price of gold soared. The 8th was the last day for the government to allocate gold to the gold industry. The Tongfengyu Gold Shop purchased 540 gold bars on that day. Among the 2.95335 billion yuan of notes delivered, 2.53335 billion yuan of notes were not exchanged on the same day, or a transfer application was obtained. They were stored in the treasury of the Central Bank by the Treasury Department, which has been admitted without denial. Judging from the circumstances, there was an obvious act of collusion for illicit purposes. The original trial was based on this to convict them, and there were no errors." Regarding Yang and Zhan's defense, it was rejected, saying: "The petitioners have been deliberately evasive, with nothing more than the intention of obtaining exemption from punishment, which is not sufficient to adopt."

### Postal Workers' Treatment Will Not Be Reduced Again

Statements from Persons in Charge of the Postal Workers' Union

Regarding the upcoming implementation of the measure stipulating that the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises should not exceed 30% of the treatment of civil servants, news of this has caused a great reaction among personnel in various state-owned enterprises. According to persons in charge of the National Postal Workers' Union in Shanghai, the measure is only seen in the newspapers, and the nature, system, and employee welfare facilities of various state-owned enterprises are different. Enforcing uniformity in a rigid manner may cause many obstacles. Taking postal workers as an example, they have no welfare facilities such as dormitories or canteens, their salaries are low, and they have been reduced by 20% since July. Their lives are very difficult. If the treatment is reduced again, it will not only be unbearable for postal workers, but it will also be difficult to maintain the good service efficiency of today's postal service. Now the postal service is relying on the efforts of all postal workers to move towards reform. Therefore, it is believed that any measure that reduces the enthusiasm of postal workers and hinders the progress of the postal service will not be implemented in the postal service. If it is implemented, it will inevitably be strongly and effectively opposed by postal workers across the country, and the consequences will be borne by the authorities.

### General Manager of XINSUI Sued for Fraud

(2) Request the government to strictly prevent smuggling and promulgate criminal laws such as regulations for punishing smuggling.

### The Number of National Representatives and Legislative Committee Members for Commercial Groups: Four City Leaders Cable the Legislative Yuan to Suggest an Increase. The Shipping Association Also Submits Three More Reasons to Fight For It.

Although the number of National Assembly representatives from national industrial and commercial groups has been approved by the State Council and increased from 31 to 68, the method of distribution will be determined by the Legislative Yuan. However, compared to the 134 representatives from agricultural groups and 126 from labor groups, it is still considered too few. Moreover, the original number of 15 legislative committee members has not been increased, so industrial and commercial groups still feel unsatisfied. It is now reported that the mayor of this city, Wu Guozhen, the speaker of the Municipal Council, Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Fang Zhi, and the director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, have also jointly sent a letter to President Sun of the Legislative Yuan regarding the issue of the number of representatives, with the following original letter:

"To President Zhesheng: We have repeatedly learned from the newspapers about your discussions, promoting justice, saying what is difficult for others to say, and having the effect of shifting international attention. We admire your dedication and tireless efforts. We, the local officials in Shanghai, are in daily contact with people in industry and commerce and deeply understand the psychology of merchants. Since the beginning of constitutional governance, all citizens have the equal right to participate in politics. This time, the number of representatives allocated to commercial groups is too small, causing dissatisfaction from all parties. Summarizing the opinions from all sides, there are approximately four points:

The Consideration of Feelings and Reason Is Too Small

(1) The Founding Father advocated revolution and aimed at all citizens of the country. Therefore, our revolution is called a revolution of the whole people, and our politics is based on the happiness of the whole people. Government facilities have no class distinctions. This is what the Founding Father's teachings tell us, and this is also the legislative spirit of the Constitution, which needs no further explanation. Therefore, there is no doubt that commercial groups should enjoy equal electoral rights with all other groups in the country. (2) Among the agricultural, industrial, and commercial entities in our country, commercial groups have the most sound organization and the longest history, and the number of members is particularly large. Among all types of national entities, there are very few that can compete with them. According to the principles of elections, those with sound members and a large number of people should be given a relatively larger number of representatives, which is the right way to go. However, in the list of representative allocations passed by the Legislative Yuan, commercial groups only account for 13 National Assembly representatives and 5 legislative committee members, which is too small considering feelings and reason.

Lack of Standards Is Regrettable

(3) Even if we take a step back, the population participating in occupational elections and the number of representatives to be elected according to the Constitution should be distributed equally. Although Guo Zhen and others do not have precise statistics at hand for reference, it is certain that the number of representatives obtained by commercial groups is below the general level compared to the number of their members. To give another example, the number of members in some free professional groups is insufficient for the total number of legal signatures when candidates for National Assembly representatives register. Therefore, the distribution of the number of representatives in this occupational group election is not only particularly unfair but also flawed. (4) Furthermore, when checking the allocation of the number of National Assembly representatives for occupational groups, there were established rules to follow during the first National Assembly. In 1946, the revised and promulgated "National Assembly Representative Election Law" Appendix Three, commercial groups accounted for a total of 104 representatives, about one-third of the total number of industrial, agricultural, and commercial associations. Now, we are abandoning this basis and ignoring it, and making arbitrary and standardless allocations, which is truly regrettable.

Merchants Are Enthusiastic About Participating in Politics

It is a good phenomenon in the constitutional process that merchants are enthusiastic about participating in politics. It is said that the esteemed court is about to negotiate a remedy, showing great impartiality and willingness to accept good advice, which is deeply admired by all Chinese people. It is suggested that the total number of National Assembly representatives for occupational groups was originally 450, and it is proposed to increase the total number to 500. In this way, the commercial groups, including the original 13 representatives, would have a total of 63 representatives. After each of the 35 provinces and 12 municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan receives one representative, the remaining 16 representatives can be allocated two each to the National Federation of Banking Associations and the National Federation of Shipping Associations. The remaining 14 can be used to increase the number of representatives based on the economic status and number of members of commercial groups in each province and city, to adapt to the actual situation.

Moderately Increase the Quota to Slightly Reassure the Public

The total number of legislative committee members for occupational groups was originally 84, and it is proposed to increase the total number to 90. In this way, the commercial groups, including the original 5 representatives, would have a total of 11 representatives. After the National Federation of Banking Associations and the National Federation of Shipping Associations each elect one representative, the remaining 9 representatives cannot be divided into regions due to the large number of units, and can only be jointly elected by national commercial groups. According to the above methods, the increase is limited, so it should not cause too much disruption and affect the entire case, but it is also sufficient to slightly reassure the public, so that the election will not be stalled in parts and hinder the overall situation. Knowing that this matter is subject to the balance of power, Guo Zhen and others are acting within the scope of their duties and should not overstep their authority. However, in view of the public's high expectations, we dare to fulfill our responsibility to express our opinions and feelings at the time of the negotiation and revision. We respectfully submit this letter, hoping that it will be reviewed, adopted, and deeply appreciated. We respectfully wish you well in your administration. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian respectfully."

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shipping Association has been continuously sending telegrams to relevant ministries and departments to fight for three National Assembly representatives and legislative committee members. It is now learned that the association has reiterated three reasons, stating that the shipping industry is not comparable to ordinary commercial groups, and sent a telegram to the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Organization, and other competent authorities, requesting: (1) The number of National Assembly and legislative committee members for commercial groups should be increased in proportion to the National Assembly and the previous National Assembly. (2) Allocate the number of representatives for the shipping industry from the number of representatives for commercial groups, and allow the shipping industry to elect independently.

### Chen Jinliang, Owner of the Huasheng Silk and Satin Factory, Was Kidnapped. Four Monks Are Suspected and Were Interrogated Yesterday. They Vehemently Denied Colluding with Bandits.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of a Putuo Mountain monk being accused of colluding with bandits, kidnapping, and extorting forty gold bars was initially heard yesterday by Judge Shao Renjie of the District Court. The case arose when Chen Jin, the owner of the Huasheng Silk and Satin Printing and Dyeing Factory in this city, and his granddaughter, Chen Ye, went to the Three Saints Hall on Putuo Mountain to perform Buddhist ceremonies. On the night of July 12, more than a dozen armed bandits suddenly came and entered Chen's bedroom by climbing over the window with ladders. In addition to looting all of Chen's luggage and clothes, they kidnapped him to Zhujiajian to hide him. Later, the bandits extorted forty gold bars. The abbot of the temple, Xingkong (also the abbot of the Shanghai Taiping Temple and Chongde Fuyuan Temple), the receptionist Xingxian, and the incense keepers Zhou Xiaoxiang and Jiang Shengquan, accompanied Tang Shanxing, a representative sent by the bandits, to Shanghai with Chen Jinliang's handwriting. They lived in the Taiping Temple and negotiated the ransom procedures with Chen's son, Minshan, resulting in the payment of 100 million yuan in cash and three gold bars. On the 23rd of the same month, Chen was released and returned home. When Xingxian and others were about to leave Shanghai, Chen reported to the Xincheng Police Station, which arrested Xingkong, Xingxian, Zhou Xiaoxiang, and others at the pier. Jiang Shengquan was arrested at the Taiping Temple. After interrogation, it was determined that Xingxian and others were suspected of colluding with the bandits and were directly transferred to the District Court for interrogation in accordance with Article 2, Item 9, and Article 5, Item 3, of the Regulations for Punishing Bandits. At the hearing yesterday, Chen Jinliang did not appear, and his son, Chen Minshan, appeared as his agent. He stated that his father had been friends with Xingkong for many years. This time, Xingkong accompanied him to Putuo and was kidnapped. Afterwards, the incense keeper Zhou Xiaoxiang and his daughter Chen Ye returned to Shanghai to explain the situation. They stated that when the bandits climbed over the window, his father was playing cards with Xingkong and others. The bandits' target was his father. After being kidnapped, he heard that he was being held on a small boat and went to Ningbo to visit friends to rescue him, but the pirates were too rampant and the military police were unable to help. The next day, he received a call from his home in Shanghai, informing him that his mother had returned to Shanghai and that bandits had accompanied the monks to Shanghai to negotiate the ransom. He did not want to meet with a third party. I disguised myself as a worker and negotiated with a bandit who called himself "A Wang" at the Taiping Temple. Seeing that my father's letter stated that they had agreed on 15 gold bars, I first handed over three gold bars and 100 million yuan in cash. There were still nine gold bars that I planned to pay at the Three Saints Hall in Putuo. The bandits agreed to release the person. At that time, the suppression of bandits in Zhenjiang was very tight, and the bandits fled in panic. My father was able to escape and return home. Later, the monk Xingkong confessed that he was the abbot of the Shanghai Taiping Temple, the Putuo Three Saints Hall, and the Chongde Fuyuan Temple. He became a monk at the age of 18. This time, Chen went to Putuo to hold a seven-day water and land ceremony. On the evening of July 12, at 11 o'clock, while he was playing cards with Chen, bandits broke in and kidnapped him. He admitted to the bandits and Chen's son negotiating the ransom at the Taiping Temple, but claimed that he did not collude with the bandits and was only working to help Chen. Xingxian confessed that he was the supervisor of the Chongde Fuyuan Temple and that he and Xingkong were like brothers. This time, he accompanied the bandits to Shanghai entirely to help Xingkong. Xingkong held concurrent positions at three temples and was busy with affairs. To take care of his brotherly relationship, he was willing to go through fire and water. He claimed that he was not present at the kidnapping and denied colluding with the bandits. The court showed him a receipt for the ransom, Xingxian said that this was the payment voucher set by the bandits. The court ordered the two monks to write in court to verify the handwriting. The incense keepers Cheng Shouzhi, Zhou Xiaoxiang, and Jiang Shengquan all vehemently denied colluding with the bandits. The court stated that the victim in this case, Chen Jinliang, had not appeared in court, and his testimony was important. He was ordered to report on time with his wife, Wang, at the next hearing. The two monks and Zhou and Jiang were still detained. It is reported that the bandit leaders in the kidnapping case, Zhou Honggen, Ao Kai, and others, have been captured by the Zhejiang Third District Security Command and executed on the spot. The bandit bases in Huludao and other places have been cleared.

### Woman Drugged in Coffee, Defrauded, and Wakes Up in Great Sorrow

[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Peizhen, a dancer from Jinshan Dance Hall, is 18 years old and from Suzhou. When the hall closed the night before last, she accepted an invitation from a dance patron, Qiu Dezhang (25 years old, from Pudong, residing at No. 8, Lane 501, Dihua Road), to go to a nearby coffee shop. Unexpectedly, Qiu, seeing Huang's rich clothing, had evil intentions and secretly mixed sleeping pills into her coffee. After drinking it, Huang became confused and was eventually taken by Qiu to Room 507 of the Continental Hotel on Xizang Road. Qiu's accomplices, Ye Deyu and Zhang Shoushan, were also in the room. Seeing the situation, they helped Qiu snatch a gold bracelet and a gold watch that Huang was wearing. Afterwards, Qiu stayed there overnight and raped the woman. When she woke up in the middle of the night, the woman realized that she had been defiled and that her gold jewelry had disappeared at the same time. Overcome with shame and anger, she grabbed Qiu and cried for help. The waiter arrived, asked about the situation, and telegraphed the Xincheng Police Station, which dispatched patrol officer Wang Jichuan to take Huang to the station for questioning.

### Songtong Piloting Association Submits Application for Record Registration

However, the Songtong section (i.e., Wusong to Tongsha) is still piloted by foreigners, with only two Chinese participating. Because it is related to sovereignty, it has attracted much attention from the shipping industry. Recently, the Songtong Piloting Association has been organized, with its headquarters at No. 73 Zhongshan East Road, and has drafted rules and regulations to apply to the relevant authorities for registration. Once approved, it will be formally established.

### Li Shiqun's Concubine Attempts to Evade the Reversal of Illicit Assets. Three Monks Come Forward to Resell Them to Cao Huilin for a Price of 136 Million Yuan. The City Defense Department Summons Zhu Yuru and Mingzhen for Questioning.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 13th] There is a delicate Western-style house at No. 11 Shuanglin Lane, Zhongzheng Road, in this city, with about ten rooms. The house was given by the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Bank Director Li Wenbin to Li Shiqun's concubine. After the victory, Li's concubine, in an attempt to evade the reversal of illicit assets, transferred it to three monks, Xuanming, Mingyang, and Yishen, of the Xuanming Lecture Hall on Daxilu Road in Shanghai. Li's concubine had an illicit relationship with Xuanming, and after Xuanming obtained the house, he sent several nuns to live there to avoid attention. He also destroyed the original contract.

Recently, Xuanming heard rumors from the outside world and was heavily criticized. He entrusted Zhu Yuru, who had served as a puppet town chief, and Zhu Jinren and Zhang Zhidao, the owners of Zhu Yonghe on Lindun Road, to sell it to Cao Huilin, a famous Shanghai actress, for 136 million yuan. Afterwards, someone reported it to the City Defense Command. Yesterday, the military law office summoned Zhu Yuru and the nun Mingzhen, who lived there, for questioning. Zhu claimed that he had not handled the sale of the house. Mingzhen said that she did not know the inside story. After the questioning, Zhu and others were released on bail.

### Chaotic Edible Oil Market: China Trust Suspends Distribution Yesterday; New Measures to be Determined, Possibly Resuming on Monday

China Trust Bureau temporarily suspended the distribution of edible oil yesterday. According to Yu Ruxin, manager of the purchasing department of the bureau, the reason for the temporary suspension is that the edible oil market has been too chaotic recently, and it is necessary to review the regulations. Therefore, the distribution has been temporarily suspended, and a thorough method will be formulated. A decision will be made as soon as Mayor Wu and President Zhang return to Shanghai. If time permits, distribution may resume as early as next Monday. The current problem is entirely due to speculative buying. (1) The price of raw materials in the producing area has risen, and the price of oil has also risen accordingly. Those who engage in individual speculation have taken the opportunity to become active. They buy 700,000 in the local area and sell it to the countryside for 900,000. Market competition raises prices. (2) Part of the floating capital is making trouble, taking the opportunity to hoard and seek profit. (3) In addition to the above two situations, there are also those who take risks and engage in smuggling, which has caused severe fluctuations in the market, and the black market price is too far from the distribution price. In terms of the actual supply and demand situation in this city, the city's demand is only over 30,000 dans per month. In addition to the distribution by the bureau, Zhongzhi Factory also distributes 600 to 700 dans per day, accounting for half. The bureau is preparing 30,000 dans this time, of which 5,400 dans are reserved for the distribution of employees, leaving 24,600 dans, which is enough to meet the market demand. Other oil factories also have oil in stock, and the discussion is not a problem. The current situation is actually man-made. Trading of warehouse receipts has now been prohibited. Delivery is limited to two days after the transaction, that is, payment on the second day of the transaction, and delivery on the third day. If it expires, the transaction will be invalid. It is still difficult to determine what the future measures will be, and whether to increase the distribution price is also up to Mayor Wu to decide. The suspension of distribution this time will definitely not affect the market price, because the daily distribution quantity of the bureau has been as high as 30,000 dans, at least over 1,000 dans.

[Central News Agency, this city] Since the Plant Oil Refining Industry Association of the Third District temporarily suspended the sale of edible oil in the market on the 13th, oil prices have fluctuated drastically. However, Zhongzhi Oil Factory continues to maintain its regular distribution work and does not stop it as a result. It is reported that the factory has also decided to distribute oil to Group C, numbers 501 to 600, next Monday. Each retail oil store will receive one barrel of cooked vegetable oil, totaling 350 dans, at a price of 750,000 yuan per dan.

### The Four Joint Offices Approves Cotton Ordering Loans After Accepting Advice

The Four Joint Offices has decided on loans for ordering daily necessities for people's livelihood. No separate measures will be formulated, but rather a case-by-case approval method will be implemented, starting with edible oil and cotton. Two cases were approved at the board meeting on the 11th of this month.

(1) China Trust Bureau ordered 30,000 dans of edible oil from the Plant Oil Refining Industry Association of the Third District, with contracts signed separately by ten factories including Zhongzhi, Dachang, and Xin. Zhongzhi accounts for one-half. Regarding the price, because the market fluctuates from time to time, it cannot be fixed in advance, and it is determined according to the market price on the payment date. After the sales contract is concluded for each batch, payment is made in three installments. Payment is made once every ten days, and delivery is made in Shanghai in three installments, once every fifteen days. Each member factory signs contracts individually and finds its own guarantor separately. However, each member factory must still bear the responsibility of joint and several guarantee. Zhongzhi is responsible for oil quality inspection.

(2) The Huainan Salt Reclamation Company General Administration was approved to release cotton loans of 5 billion yuan, with the loan period limited to five months and a monthly interest rate of 4%. When the loan is due, the principal and interest will be repaid at the price of lint cotton. The price of lint cotton is determined according to the market price at the time of payment, with Nantong as the delivery location for the cotton.

### National Bonds Trend Downward, Foreign Stocks Fall Back

Public bonds were unsupported yesterday and trended downward again, with even fewer transactions, only around 4 million. Although Room 230 was accepting them, Rooms 550, 552, and retail investors were slightly accepting them. National Bond C opened at 12,400 yuan in the morning, then slightly decreased to close below 12,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, National Bond A, B, and E each fell 400 yuan. National Bond C slightly increased by 300 yuan, while National Bond D fell by 700 yuan.

Foreign stocks fluctuated and fell back yesterday. The market was unstable in the middle of the day. Securities brokers were still buying, banks were selling, and foreign and Cantonese brokers sold immediately after entering. Ewo Yarns opened at 10,600 yuan in the morning, first falling to 10,400 yuan, then rising back to 10,7300 yuan, and then falling back to 10,300 yuan, before stabilizing slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yieh Kwong Telephone remained flat, Paper Mill fell slightly by 10%, Ewo Brewery and Steel Industry each fell by 50%, and Ewo Yarns, British American Tobacco, and Wheelock Marden each slightly declined.

### Discount and Loan Committee Approves 14 Cases

[This newspaper] The 23rd regular meeting of the Industrial Loan Review Committee of the Discount and Loan Committee of the Central Bank was held in the committee's conference room at 2:30 PM yesterday. More than ten members were present, chaired by Zhu Tongjiu. As a result of the review, fourteen industrial loan cases were approved, amounting to 4.14 billion yuan, which will be approved at this week's Discount and Loan Committee meeting.

### Qi Hong Tea Transactions Stagnant

The Qimen black tea of this year, which was actively inspected by companies such as Wang Yutai and Huacha a few days ago, was inquired about by various parties in the market yesterday. However, buyers' bids were unusually stingy, only around 1.2 million to 2 million yuan per dan, which formed a stark contrast with the sellers' asking prices, and transactions ultimately lacked activity. The supply and demand for other varieties remained scarce, and the market situation was calm. As for domestic tea, sales by this street and by guest merchants have not stopped. Although various grades of prices are being sold one after another by retail investors, there are also many who frequently consider raising prices, so they have been able to support the market from falling, and as a result, it continues to show a fluctuating trend.

According to industry insiders, the Anhui black tea of this year, which exporters have been longing for for a long time, is difficult to trade due to the tightening of prices. It is also learned that currently, colleagues are specially shipping 50 boxes to Wuxi for domestic sales. It is heard that they are mostly medium-grade goods, priced at 650,000 yuan per dan.

### This City's Rice and Flour: Loans Should Not Be a Problem; Government Temporarily Does Not Dump and Strengthens Rice Distribution

[This newspaper] Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday: The supply of rice and flour in this city should not be a problem. Although white indica and thin japonica have fluctuated, the intermediate grade of indica rice has always maintained a price of over 300,000 yuan, so the recent rise in rice prices has not had a great impact on citizens. The government has a set policy on food, and does not intend to dump it on the market in the near future, but will strive to strengthen distribution. Dumping, although it can suppress market prices, will stimulate the producing areas and prevent goods from coming to Shanghai. Edible oil has been temporarily suspended by the China Trust Bureau because market dumping has been discovered, with corruption in between. Negotiations are underway to change the technical aspects of dumping.

Foreign Rice Still Has Quotas

It is also reported: This city's rice reserves are extremely strong, that is, the foreign rice ordered by the China Trust Bureau, more than 300,000 tons have been shipped this year. According to the person in charge of the bureau, this year's International Food Emergency Conference still has a quota of 200,000 tons, which will be purchased from the United States, Burma, Siam, and other countries before the end of this year. They are being shipped one after another recently. The Burmese rice of 6,000 tons loaded on the Hai Chen wheel will arrive in a few days. The rice transported by the bureau is handed over to the People's Food Regulation Committee for distribution to public educators and factory workers, and 300,000 dans have been allocated since July.

Weak Store Stomach and Cold Spleen: Japonica Rice Falls Back

Yesterday, the source of rice and grain was still abundant, with a total of more than 13,600 piculs arriving in the two cities of the south. The store stomach and cold spleen were weak, and transactions were sluggish. Japonica rice fell back by 120,000 yuan, new japonica rice fell sharply by more than 20,000 yuan, and early thin indica rice and medium grade also fell by 120,000 yuan. New goods of indica rice arrived from all directions, and new Du indica, sheep indica, and Tuan indica also fell by 20,000 yuan. New and old guest indica followed the decline by 3,000 to 11,000 yuan. White yuan and Yin yuan were also tired by 10,000 yuan. New white yuan from Kunshan saw new goods for the first time. The weather was clear and the rice market situation has turned downward.

The distribution price of flour remains unchanged, and distribution continues. The market dynamics are also quite calm, and the price is stable. Bran sales to the countryside are normal and remain stable, but small packages are lively due to the union of Minfang's processing. Soybean cakes vary from each other, and prices are mixed. The guest sales of soybeans are inactive, and the oil factories are also sluggish, cutting 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, entering a fluctuating situation. Mung beans are selling well, and continue to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans have very little retail sales, and the price rises by more than 10,000 yuan. Garden peas continue to be processed in Shantou, and the price rises by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Raw kernels have little trading, and the price is unchanged. Sesame seeds are still thin from foreign sellers, sales are average, and there is still little vitality. Sorghum from Beiyang shows weakness, and the price is lower by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn from Beiyang is also weak, with high-grade goods falling back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and medium-grade goods falling sharply by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Wheat is in short supply, with very few arrivals, and the mainland continues to rise, increasing by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan.

Soybean oil is trending relatively stable, and clear oil also has little fluctuation. Sesame oil has not changed, and raw oil is selling well. Transactions in this street are smooth, and the price rises by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rises sharply by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan.

### Daily Necessities Rise Sharply

Yesterday, in the soap market for daily necessities, the industry's buying appetite remained strong, and the participation of outsiders in hammering and raising prices made the market even more fierce. In the end, Guben soap rose by another 19,000 yuan compared to the previous day, Huang Xiangmao rose by 12,000 yuan, Arrow Knife rose by 15,000 yuan, and Guanghua, Henry, Beef Liver, and others all rose by more than 10,000 yuan.

Due to repeated increases in raw materials and increased costs, the price of Chicken Brand candles rose by 10,000 yuan per box, and other brands also saw price increases.

Matches: Beautiful Brand matches sold particularly well, and the price rose by 50,000 yuan. Phoenix Brand rose by 20,000 yuan, and other new brands also slightly increased.

There is still no news of kerosene distribution. With thin inventory and smooth sales, the price of tall barrel-packaged kerosene rose to 1.55 million to 1.6 million yuan, and Mobil canned oil was 192,000 to 3,000 yuan.

### Rayon Soars, Highest Price Exceeds 30 Million Yuan Mark

Although the 39th batch of rayon was distributed as usual, the market price soared again yesterday. No. 120 Jin San Ma Guang, after opening at 28.1 million yuan, immediately rose. The upward trend was fierce, and the maximum even exceeded the 30 million yuan mark. The closing price at noon was 30 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to no shortage of people selling at high prices, the market was slightly fatigued, and the final selling price was 29.8 million yuan. No. 120 Sinclair was priced at 29 million yuan. The results were all 2 million yuan higher than the previous day.

Factory Warp

Yesterday, the market sentiment was firm, and the asking prices at all levels were 1 million to 1.5 million yuan higher than the previous day. D-grade was asking for 34 million yuan, but because of the shortage of goods, everyone insisted, so very few transactions were made. The transaction price for medium-grade other warp was 2 million to 2.5 million yuan, and the transaction price for high-grade other warp was 3.5 million to 4 million yuan. Dry warp was particularly popular, and 28% of the 5 dans of goods had an opening price of 23.8 million yuan, and the opening price for other warp was also between 21.5 million yuan.

Silk Goods

Affected by the sharp rise in raw materials, and because of fewer production days due to the strike, all parties were searching very hard, and factory prices were also raised. After opening at 13 million yuan for a real silk quilt cover yesterday, the market continued to rise. The closing price was 31.6 million to 31.7 million yuan for the current week, and 300,000 yuan for the week of Monday. Grid crepe was asking for 45,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Huajin crepe high-end goods were 27,500 yuan, and Linji wax feather gauze was 28,500 yuan. Minsheng flower ti was 29,000 yuan. All had transactions, and Sheng Hang and other goods were also rising.

### Wool Prices Firm

The wholesale market for wool was still openly firm and secretly rising yesterday. Tea parties and large wholesalers had considerable openings. Local and guest merchants were healthy in their buying appetite for dark gray wool and serge for autumn and winter needs. Most of the British, American, and Jewish foreign merchants were all switching to selling US dollars. Mai Er and others were all asking for 7.5 yuan a yard, flat thick wool was 12.5 to 15 yuan, and overcoat wool was 8.5 to 12.5 yuan. If goods were priced in legal tender, most were not based on the market price but on the black market standard.

We are specially informing you for verification and instruction, and please carefully review the above documents before selling foreign exchange, in order to be prudent, and please also inform your bank's branches to check accordingly.

### Active Buying from All Parties: Both Yarn and Cloth Rise

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation improved because guest merchants turned smooth in their buying. Many non-industry people in this street were searching for goods, and with the cool autumn weather and active sales, the market rose under the eager need of all parties. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose to 19.5 million yuan, an increase of 800,000 compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse rose by 900,000, and Light Double Horse and 16-count Guangming each rose by 700,000. Other coarse and fine yarns all rose by 500,000 to 1 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market situation rose as soon as it opened, and the price of actual sales of cloth rose particularly sharply. It was also heard that there was a huge amount of floating capital active in North China, and under the shroud of various profitable buying news, the market became even more enthusiastic and the market soared. Unexpectedly, by noon, it was suddenly reported that cross-line checks could not be used on the same day, and there was also talk of the success of the Sino-US loan, and the market atmosphere suddenly became tired. By the end, Longtou fine cloth still rose by more than 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 537,000 yuan. The after-hours price was shouted up to 480,000 yuan, and the final price was 430,000 to 44,000 yuan. Other cloths also rose by 3,000 to 120,000 yuan.

### Selling Pressure Prevailed at the Close: Chinese Stocks Initially Rised, Then Fell

Yesterday, the high price of Chinese stocks was difficult to sustain. The general buying trend in the middle of the day caused small stocks such as Xinhua, Xinya, and Chenan to be shouted up to the limit, and the entire market was full of vitality and very popular. Securities broker Yang, a major player, took the opportunity to come out of the cage outside the market. In addition, foreign stocks returned slightly, and with the thought of selling, selling pressure rose immediately and crashed very quickly. Unfavorable news, such as the inability to use same-day notes and the news of the success of the Sino-US loan, were widely circulated. Hot stocks closed at low prices at the close, and cold stocks that were not commonly traded also stood at high levels. The future trend became uncertain again.

As a result, compared to the previous close, medium-French stock increased by slightly less than 10%, Xinhua rose to the limit and then returned, increasing by 50%. Yongsha was flat, and Xinhuo, Meiya, and Qinxing slightly declined. Yonggong, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Huafeng slightly increased. Jinglun, Matches, Rongfeng, and Zhabei were all flat. The remaining stocks showed slight increases and decreases. In terms of forward-delivery stocks, Huafeng and Xinguang slightly increased, and Yongsha, Xinhuo, Meiya, Jingfu, and Qinxing slightly declined. The increase and decrease of various old stocks outside the market were slight.

Securities Exchange

Yesterday's announcement stated that the transaction units will be slightly changed from September 18th. Yongsha will be changed to 100,000 shares, and Xinguang, Meiya, Jingfu, Huafeng, Medium-French, Rongfeng, and Qinxing will each be 50,000 shares.

### Methods for Treating Memory Loss

Mr. Tang Zhengzhong: Memory loss is the result of overusing the brain or being too weak. If you want to restore it to its normal state, you must quickly find a way to diagnose and treat it. The treatment guidelines are as follows: (1) Rest: Try to reduce work that requires brainpower. (2) Go to bed early: Do not stay up late. If you have insomnia or dream a lot, you must take sedatives. (4) Take more brain-tonifying medicine, such as phosphorus preparations, arsenic preparations, etc. If you can do this, it will definitely be beneficial.

### Second Anniversary of Restoration Commemorative Supplement: Shanghai Telecommunications in the Past Two Years

— Yu Bingjian

Before the war, the Ministry of Transportation's telecommunications organizations in Shanghai included the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and the International Telecommunications Cooperative. After the August 13th all-out resistance against Japan, all Shanghai telecommunications institutions were seized by the Japanese enemy. I, Bingjian, led a small number of telecommunications personnel to remain in Shanghai to undertake secret communications work. In August 1945, when the Japanese surrendered unconditionally, I was ordered to organize the Ministry of Transportation's Jiangnan District Telecommunications Restoration Office in Shanghai, which was later reorganized into the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) District Telecommunications Receiving Committee, to rebuild Shanghai's telecommunications industry. On September 14 of the same year, we officially took over the enemy puppet's Central China Electrical Communications Company. From that day on, we have shouldered the responsibility for electrical communications between Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the country, and various parts of the country. Therefore, this day is the anniversary of the restoration of Shanghai Telecommunications. Time flies like an arrow, and today, it has been two full years.

In order to review the past and plan for the future, we hereby briefly describe the progress of our bureau's work over the past two years:

Restoration Period

Since our bureau took over the enemy puppet's Central China Electrical Communications Company, we had to maintain existing communications and plan for new circuits. At the same time, because of the initial victory, various public and private institutions, factories, and schools in the rear were returning to the Jinghu area. Therefore, in a very short period of time, all parts of the country urgently demanded direct communication with Shanghai. However, at that time, our bureau was extremely short of staff, and after Shanghai fell into enemy hands, the original equipment was destroyed. What we received was also incomplete and damaged. Using such a situation to meet the needs of the time was naturally stretched thin and unable to attend to everything. The only solution was to actively carry out restoration work, that is, to repair machinery and lines, add equipment, and reorganize operations, while at the same time expediting the return of skilled telegraph and telephone operators from the pre-war Shanghai Telegraph and Telephone Bureaus, and to transfer senior staff from various bureaus in the rear to Shanghai to jointly shoulder this arduous task. In addition, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment at that time, we screened the original personnel of Central China, selected the best, and employed them to supplement the shortage of manpower. After several months of planning, by May of last year, each department of our bureau had a dedicated person in charge, and the restoration work came to an end. Regarding the restoration issue, there is one more point that should be mentioned, that is, although our bureau had many former staff members return and employed many Central China employees, we still felt that there were not enough people due to the rapid development of business. Therefore, in February of last year, we restored the Shanghai Telecommunications Personnel Training Institute, recruiting and training technical telegraph operators. In a short period of more than a year, more than 400 students have graduated.

Initial Construction

After our bureau's restoration work came to an end last year, the Shanghai market became increasingly prosperous, and the need for foreign telecommunications became more urgent. Therefore, our bureau's business also rose in a straight line. By the busiest time in April of this year, the number of telegrams sent and received daily reached more than 30,000, and the number of long-distance telephone calls made and received also exceeded 10,000. The degree of busyness was not only unprecedented before the war, but even Chongqing, which was known as extremely busy during the war, had never had such a record. Under these circumstances, our bureau had to double its efforts and launched a constructive comprehensive expansion program. Therefore, since the second half of last year, every part of our bureau, whether it is the General Office, Telegraph Room, Long-Distance Station, Business Office, Transmission Station, Reception Station, Exchange, or even the Materials Storage and Transportation Room, has been working in a tense atmosphere.

After more than a year of efforts, as of today, in terms of equipment, we have 35 various wireless transmitters, approximately 50 receivers, 18 automatic telegraph fast machines, more than 20 long-distance telephone carrier terminal machines, more than 6,000 automatic and manual city telephone numbers, and in the city and remote control lines, there are approximately 1,000 pairs of kilometers of overhead open lines and approximately 30,000 pairs of kilometers of electric core lines. Except for the city telephone, which has not been able to be greatly expanded due to the difficult source of materials, various equipment has increased by approximately three to five times compared to when it was received, and efficiency has also been repeatedly improved.

New Equipment

In addition, many new equipments have been added, such as fax machines, teletypewriters, diversity receivers, ultra-short wave wireless machines, frequency shift signaling equipment, single sideband wireless terminals for international calls, etc., all of which were not seen before the war, and are novel communication tools even abroad.

Currently, the communication circuits between Shanghai and various places include 48 manual and fast telegraph circuits, and 65 direct long-distance telephone circuits. In addition, there are approximately 140 other locations that can be switched for calls. In addition, on July 1 of this year, we restored the Sino-American long-distance wireless telephone.

New Business

In terms of business, the work done in the past two years has been even more burdensome than the engineering department. Especially in the recent half year, our bureau, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Transportation and the Telecommunications Administration, has completed many new measures to improve business. This has a great relationship to the future development of our bureau. The items that have been held are approximately the following:

(1) Regarding facilitating the public, there are: increasing branch business offices and agencies (currently there are 16), widely establishing public telephones (currently there are more than 130), and creating telegraph booths and mobile telegraph bureaus (currently there are 6 telegraph booths and 2 mobile telegraph bureaus).

(2) Regarding improving service, there are: establishing model business offices (currently there are 3), setting up business offices and city telephone service desks, adding long-distance inquiry desks and reporting desks, translating incoming telegrams, compiling service manuals for business personnel, improving handling procedures, and strengthening service spirit.

(3) Regarding the implementation of new businesses, there are: opening Jinghu authentic calligraphy telegrams, opening discounted social telegrams, telephone sending and receiving telegrams, telephone notification of collection of outgoing telegrams, transmitting long-distance telephone calls on behalf, opening discounted night letter telegrams, and opening discounted nighttime telephone calls.

(4) Regarding increasing speed, there are: limited-time delivery of telegrams, limited-time connection of express telephone calls, increasing wireless fast machine circuits (currently there are 15), increasing carrier telephone circuits (currently there are 41), using teletypewriters (currently there are 11), using motorcycles to deliver telegrams by telegraph delivery men (currently there are 6), increasing express telephone circuits (currently there are 7), and increasing express telegram circuits (currently there are 18).

(5) Regarding the improvement of accuracy, there are: spot-checking telegram paper strips, inquiring door-to-door, implementing work competitions, and strictly implementing error penalties.

(6) Regarding publicity, there are: strengthening business inspection and inquiry, sending out test letters, adding speed labels, strengthening advertising and recording, window display, film, slides, and broadcasting.

Other Work

In addition to engineering business, other aspects, such as receiving, storing, transporting and purchasing materials on behalf of the General Administration and various bureaus, verifying and issuing import passports and re-export certificates on behalf of the Ministry of Transportation, reorganizing the city's broadcasting stations, cracking down on private radio stations, managing specially established radio stations, holding examinations for ship radio operators, reorganizing the bureau's own pre-war and received enemy puppet real estate, screening and retaining returning personnel, and cleaning up enemy puppet debts and material accounts, are all particularly heavy tasks for our bureau.

Work Review

In the past two years, although we have continuously increased equipment and improved business, and have received many encouragements and valuable criticisms from all walks of life regarding our bureau's efforts, which have made us even more excited and vigilant, the business has developed too quickly, resulting in the replenishment of equipment and manpower not being able to keep up. Therefore, various business innovations have not been able to match the established plans and be completed quickly. For example, various parties are now asking us to open up direct circuits or extend the time for communication and calls, but because we lack machines and lines and have an insufficient number of people, we cannot do it for the time being. Furthermore, we would very much like to expand the automatic machine keys used for city telephones to meet the needs of all sectors, but because they are difficult to purchase for the time being, we cannot implement them. The reason for all of the above is nothing more than economic and material constraints, which prevent us from doing everything we want to do. Because in the current environment, adding or reforming a very small piece of equipment often requires tens of millions or hundreds of millions of yuan, and the shortage of electricity funds is a well-known fact, it is naturally difficult to bear them all. In addition, the lack of materials is a common phenomenon in the post-war world. China is like this, and so are other countries. For example, cables and automatic telephone machine keys have been difficult to supply in Europe and the United States in the past two years. These are all unexpected difficulties. Furthermore, time is the most important factor in all construction, and it cannot be accomplished overnight. What we have done now is only preliminary construction and preliminary improvement. There are still many things left for us to do. We should naturally take responsibility to complete these many unfinished tasks.

Expansion Plan

Although we are now facing unfavorable times and an adverse environment, we cannot shirk our responsibilities, nor can we fail to find ways to overcome difficulties. Furthermore, in view of the development of our bureau's business over the past two years and the possibility of Shanghai becoming more prosperous in the future, in addition to improving business, enriching equipment, improving mechanical efficiency, and strengthening the service spirit of staff, we should continue to move forward in accordance with the established policy. We believe that to meet future needs, there should also be a long-term construction plan. Although there is a temporary lack of financial and material resources, it can be done in stages, or the things that can be done can be done first. In this way, over the years, there is also hope of success. Based on this principle, in February of this year, we formulated a plan to enrich internal equipment. In this plan, the main ones are: we plan to add five powerful wireless transmitters, build one new receiving and transmitting station each, increase automatic telephones by 4,000, add 20 teletypewriters, 10 typing duplicating machines, increase the equipment of the dreadnought station by more than one time, and plan to build a telecommunications repair shop. It is also estimated that after the implementation of this plan, 30 telegram circuits, 80 long-distance telephone circuits, and 4,000 more city telephones can be added, which will be more than enough to cope with the current needs and the needs in the next two years. As for the required funds, it was estimated in February of this year that approximately 20 billion yuan would be required, which is certainly not something that can be fully borne under the current situation of scarce electricity funds. However, we have already started to proceed with the possible ones with the approval of the General Administration. It is expected that one receiving station can be completed within the year, the central room machinery can be expanded to the required level, and a part of the long-distance station equipment can also be completed. If the main machinery, such as transmitting stations and automatic telephone machine keys, can be purchased in the first half of next year, and other equipment can continue to be enriched, then this plan may be fully realized by the end of next year. By then, all the current shortcomings and difficulties can be overcome, and Shanghai's telecommunications will enter a new stage. This is what we deeply expect.

Final Hope

Finally, we believe that telecommunications is one of the public utilities, and its development depends on the common prosperity, encouragement, and assistance of the society. Therefore, we earnestly hope that all sectors can continue to provide us with valuable suggestions and criticisms at any time, and tell us the paths that should be built and reformed, so that we have a compass to guide us through the maze. In this way, the development of telecommunications will be more rapid and effective, and our ultimate goal, namely the three major conditions of telecommunications, speed, accuracy, and convenience, can also be achieved as soon as possible.

### Cultivation of Telecommunications Talents in Shanghai for 65 Years

— Hua Shijian

Telecommunications is a technical undertaking. It is difficult to expect development without specialized talents to operate and manage it. And this specialized talent cannot be obtained without specialized schools to cultivate it. This is the origin of the establishment of the Shanghai Training Institute for Telecommunications Personnel by the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. The Shanghai Training Institute for Telecommunications Personnel evolved from the Telegraph School, the Telegraph Training Institute, and the Telecommunications School. It was founded in the eighth year of Guangxu in the Former Qing Dynasty and has lasted for 65 years, as long as the history of the establishment of telecommunications in our country. The first school site was located in Hu Jiazhai's Hui Xiang Li (the original site is now the Grand China Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Xizang Road). Mr. Tang Bitian from Xiangshan was hired as a teacher, with a quota of 20 students. The first batch of graduates included Mr. Zeng Qingjian and other 20 people. The school's general manager was Yao Yanhong from Biling. At that time, there was no fixed graduation date. The best were promoted and assigned to telegraph bureaus to report values, and vacancies were successively examined and supplemented. After no work, it moved to the Telegraph Bureau in Zhengjia Wooden Bridge (now the southwest corner of the intersection of East Zhongzheng Road and South Fujian Road). The quota of students gradually increased, so teachers Niu Shangzhou and Zhang Zhaowei were added. Later, a surveying course was set up, and a Dane, Bo Yisheng, was hired to teach electrical measurement, repairing engines, and erecting electric wires. In the eleventh year of Guangxu, a national examination for promotion of telegraph operators was held. Afterwards, it was held once every year of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You. Those who passed the examination were promoted to classes and grades. Those with excellent grades were retained in the institute to make up surveying courses in order to further their studies. At that time, those who taught the technique of telegraphing were called telegraphing tutors. Because the number of telegraph bureaus increased, the need for materials was urgent, so an extra telegraphing tutor was added. When new students entered the school, they first received preliminary training in the extra telegraphing tutor, and then entered the formal telegraphing tutor. Zeng Qingjian, Tang Wengao, Yu Shuxiang, and Rong Yongqing successively served as teachers. In the 24th year of Guangxu, Bo Yisheng returned to China due to illness, and was succeeded by a Dane, Ge Leisheng. After Ge's death, Mr. Tang Bitian succeeded him. Since then, more bureaus have been established and more people have been employed. In the 25th year of Guangxu, another telegraphing tutor was leased in a private house in Ankangli in Ximen (now the corner of Zhaojiabang Road and Zhonghua Road in Old Ximen) to add a telegraphing tutor and a preparatory surveying tutor. In the 26th year of Guangxu, Lin, the first chairman of the National Government, came to Shanghai to participate in the examination for the sixth class promotion with the qualification of a telegraph operator from Taiwan? And stay in the institute to study surveying. In the 27th year of Guangxu, another telegraphing tutor was added next to the General Bureau. In the 28th year of Guangxu, a Telegraph High School was established at No. 59 Xinzha Road (now No. 1446). A Dane, De Liansheng, was hired as the chief instructor, and Mr. Zeng Qingjian and others served as assistant teachers, with a quota of 12 students. They graduated in two years and taught advanced telecommunications technology. In the 32nd year of Guangxu, the national telecommunications was changed to government-run. The Telegraph School in Zhengjia Wooden Bridge moved to the north end of Old Garbage Bridge with the General Bureau, and separate surveying tutors, telegraphing tutors, extra telegraphing tutors, attached reading schools, and banner schools were set up to train intermediate and junior telecommunications cadres. The above-mentioned tutors and schools were all under the jurisdiction of the Telegraph General Bureau, and later renamed the Telecommunications Administration General Bureau, which was managed by the school's general manager in the General Bureau. Yu Shuxiang, Guo Shugang, and Wang Tingshu successively served as managers. In the second year of Xuantong, the various schools were merged into one, called the Telegraph School, and moved to Avenue Edward VII (west of Chengdu Road). The subjects were listed separately, and the fees were increased into each subject, with quotas of 40, 60, and 80 students. The Examination Section Chief of the Telecommunications Administration General Bureau concurrently managed the school. Zeng Qingjian and Lu Chengzhang successively served as them. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was changed to the Telegraph School, and Mr. Zhang Xifan was the principal. In less than half a year, it was changed to the Telegraph Training Institute, and Mr. Zhang still served as the director. In the autumn of the second year, it moved to Zhijie, Wangjia Pier, Nanshi. The institute is divided into elementary class, middle class, high class, Japanese class, bookkeeping class, wireless class, fast machine class, and engineering class. The curriculum and quota are determined by the Ministry of Transportation at any time. New students should pay attention to subjects such as national language, English, mathematics, science, and geography. During their studies, tuition, food, and accommodation are all free, and the training is for one year or two years. Those who enter the middle class must work in the bureau for three years, have merit and no fault, and register with the bureau when the class starts. They can only study after passing the preliminary and re-examination. Those who graduate from the high class must graduate from the middle class and work for three years. They must pass the previous examinations and be selected to enter the school when the class starts. Graduates of the elementary class are assigned to various bureaus to work as machine operators, graduates of the middle class are appointed as business chiefs of simple bureaus, and graduates of the high class are appointed as section chiefs or business chiefs of various busy bureaus. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, a correspondence middle class was added to enable junior telegraph operators in various bureaus to receive further training in telecommunications technology in their spare time. In the 16th year, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, and established the National Telecommunications Administration General Bureau in Shanghai. The practice telegraph operators in various bureaus were transferred to Shanghai in sequence for screening. Those with slightly lower grades were retained in the institute to make up lessons, which is the so-called remedial class. In the 17th year, 40 students were recruited for the middle class. The General Bureau sent Mr. Wang Yuxiang to serve as the Dean of Studies. At the end of the year, it was ordered that the Training Institute be changed to the Telecommunications School, and Wang was appointed as the principal. Mr. Yu Runsheng served as the Dean of Studies. In July of the 18th year, Mr. Yu Bingjian succeeded as the Dean of Studies. In that year, 40 people graduated from the wired middle class and 50 people graduated from the remedial class. In the 19th year, 20 people graduated from the wireless middle class and 20 people graduated from the wired middle class. On January 28th of the 21st year, the Japanese invaders invaded Shanghai, and Nanshi was also affected. People moved away one after another. The 13 people in the wireless middle class and 28 people in the bookkeeping middle class who were studying at the school graduated at that time. The 42 people in the elementary class moved to the Telegraph Bureau on Simalu to continue their classes and complete their studies. The Telecommunications School temporarily ended in April of that year. Afterwards, new students continued to be recruited and trained at the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau. In the 26th year, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and telecommunications personnel retreated with the army. In the autumn of the 34th year, after the victory and restoration, the Telecommunications Administration General Bureau issued an order at the end of the year to continue running the Training Institute for Telecommunications Personnel in Shanghai, and Mr. Yu Bingjian, the former Dean of Studies and current Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, concurrently served as the Director of the Institute. Planning and operation began, using the former enemy puppet's Central China Telecommunications College on Yuyingtang Road in Zhabei as the site. One hundred and twenty male students under the age of 22 who graduated from high school were recruited and divided into three classes: technical, grading, and telephone. Engineer Hua Shijian also served as the Director of Education. Deputy Director Sun Hongjun and Engineer Qiu Rongcai also served as the heads of the technical staff class. Director Li Tong also served as the head of the telegraph class. Engineer Zhu Fuyi also served as the head of the telephone class. Many instructors with excellent academic experience were hired to teach various courses. In the autumn of the 35th year, 30 people graduated from the telephone class and were approved to continue recruiting 100 high school graduates under the age of 20 as fast machine trainee telegraph operators. In March of this year, 15 people in the technician class, 49 people in the third-class telegraph operator class, and 98 people in the trainee telegraph operator class graduated at the same time and were assigned to work in various telegraph bureaus. In the same month, 30 third-class technicians were recruited to maintain teletypewriters, and Engineer Li Guoliang served as the head of the class. These teletypewriters were recently purchased from the United States and are the latest type of machine in electrical communications. In May of this year, 40 people were recruited for the third-class telegraph operator class and 100 people were recruited for the trainee operator class, all of whom are currently studying. There are plans to open a middle class, selecting third-class technical telegraph personnel from various bureaus to come to Shanghai for further study. The telecommunications industry after the war is no longer what it used to be, and semi-proficient generalists are difficult to meet the needs. Since the establishment of this institute, although the name has been changed many times, it has been inherited in the same line and is the main institution for training telecommunications specialists in our country, which has been the same for 65 years. According to statistics, no less than 4,000 students have graduated before and after. During the Anti-Japanese War, the vast majority of cadres at all levels in communications, construction, and management came from this institute. The mission it has assumed is so great, the time it has experienced is so long, and the talents it has produced are so many. From Chairman Lin of the National Government, Waiter Zhu Baokui of the Ministry of Posts and Communications, Minister of Communications Gao Enhong, Liang Jiaoyan, Director of the Telecommunications Administration Ju Wanpeng, Zhou Jiayi, Rong Zaiji, Xu Zhongzhe, Wu Peihuang, Tao Fengshan, and Minister Jiang Fanwu, to cadres in various bureaus across the country, their contributions to the country and society are so great that they should be able to carry forward and become a great school with substantial brilliance. According to the facts, it is not yet fully ideal. The number of school buildings is not enough for application, there are no sports venues after class, and instruments and books are also declining. At this time of national restoration and construction, we should first cultivate a large number of intermediate-level telecommunications cadres, and cultivate their pure conduct, skilled skills, and strong physique to meet modern needs.

### Sketch of Mobile Telegraph Bureau

— Yu Anglu

Although the sparrow is small, it has all the vital organs. If you want to send a telegram, please come here.

After a long period of preparation, experimentation and improvement, the mobile telegraph bureau finally met the citizens on the street for the first time on the morning of August 12. The mobile telegraph bureau is a large blue and white bus equipped with a wireless transceiver. There are three semi-graphic windows for receiving and sending telegrams on the right side of the bus. There is a movable writing board attached to the front end of the bus. It is a mobile telegram business office and also a loyal "street running gentleman" in the telecommunications bureau. Every morning, it departs from the general business office of the telecommunications bureau on Fuzhou Road and works tirelessly on the street. It must be dispatched regardless of wind, frost, rain, snow, severe cold or summer heat. In the morning, the transceivers in the bureau and in the bus must be tested by both parties. After the listening is satisfactory, it is released and started. In this way, the business clerk in the bureau and the business clerk on the bus have contact. Amid the "Ha" sound, Bao slowly marched towards the city street.

There is a little difficulty when driving: because a "fishing rod" type antenna is slanted on the roof of the bus. If it touches the uneven cables above the road, and the antenna has a large amount of current passing through it, it is not a joke if it touches it. Therefore, when driving, you have to use a rope to flatten the "fishing rod", and stand it up again after stopping at the station. When the bus stopped in front of the Great World for the first time, many people thought that the police station's patrol car had arrived, and some people said that this was a car to catch vendors, which scared the vendors to scatter. Later, I saw the words "Mobile Telegraph Bureau" and "Telecommunications" written on the bus, and then I suddenly realized. But there are also people who immediately gathered around to see what happened, and some reached out to buy stamps. After the business clerk on the bus answered and explained very kindly, many people came to "ask for information" on the second day.

Here, time and space seem to be reduced. Throughout the day, the mobile telegraph bureau passes through the bustling city center. Every time it arrives at a designated station, it stays for more than half an hour to allow citizens to send telegrams at their leisure. After receiving the telegram on the bus, it is immediately transmitted to the general business office on Fuzhou Road by wireless. Therefore, sending telegrams at the mobile telegraph bureau is no different from personally sending them to Fuzhou Road, and it can also save a sum of car fare and labor. This kind of mobile telegraph bureau will also be expanded to the suburbs in the future, so that every corner of Shanghai can send telegrams anytime and anywhere.

In this bus, there are two new tricks to introduce to you. The first is that it is equipped with the latest "steel wire recorder", which can be pre-filled with various promotional programs and sent to the bus for broadcasting. The second is to broadcast the bright bell of the Jianghai Customs from the amplifier in the mobile telegraph bureau to all the citizens, so that the clock hands in all of Shanghai move neatly and uniformly.

The mobile telegraph bureau will surely develop and grow with the thriving telecommunications industry. If you have time, I hope you will go and see this epoch-making scientific product! The Telecommunications Bureau's street runner - Mobile Telegraph Bureau

### Common Sense Talk on Telegraphs (3)

— Zhang Jiayu

Express telegrams are a type of telegram guaranteed to arrive within a specific time. For express telegrams traveling along the Beijing-Shanghai line, the delivery time is limited to one and a half hours. For express telegrams traveling to other locations with express telegram service, the delivery time is uniformly limited to two hours. If you receive an express telegram from Nanjing and the time of dispatch printed on the telegram form is, for example, 14:30 (i.e., 2:30 PM), but you receive the telegram after 4:00 PM, then this proves that the telegram has exceeded the time limit for express telegrams. You can then file a complaint with the telegraph office, requesting that the special express delivery fee attached to the express telegram be refunded to the sender.

Fast letters, of course, should be faster than ordinary letters. Therefore, urgent telegrams should also be faster than regular telegrams. If you receive an urgent telegram that is slower than a regular telegram sent from the same location, then you have sufficient reason to file a complaint with the telegraph office, requesting an investigation into the cause of the delay. The Directorate General of Telecommunications, referring to recent reports from various telegraph offices, has stipulated that urgent telegrams should arrive within four hours and regular telegrams within eight hours. The above time limits are calculated from the time the sender submits the telegram to the business office of the sending telegraph office until the receiving telegraph office delivers it to the recipient.

Night letters are a type of telegram with lower fees, charged at half the rate of regular telegrams. However, each telegram is charged for a minimum of twenty-five characters. Night letters are dispatched last, so they are naturally slower than regular telegrams.

Social telegrams are telegrams specifically for congratulatory or condolence messages. You can use pre-written phrases provided by the telegraph office, charged at half the price of regular telegrams for a minimum of twenty characters per telegram, and gift certificates can be attached. After the receiving telegraph office receives a social telegram, it will classify the nature of the telegram and transcribe it using exquisite telegram envelopes and paper in scarlet (for congratulations) or plain colors (for condolences), which is very beautiful.

The third item in the telegram header is the name of the sending telegraph office, used to indicate from where the telegram was sent. The name of the sending telegraph office is usually telegraphed in English. After the receiving telegraph office receives it, it translates the English into the Chinese place name and notes it on the incoming telegram. If the recipient has any questions about the name of the sending telegraph office, they can cross-reference the Chinese and English versions.

The number of characters recorded in the character count field refers to the total number of characters in the telegram, from the fee-paying business identifier below the telegram header to the last character. In telegrams written in foreign languages, sometimes the sender connects characters that should be separated into two or more characters into one. Although the telegraph office can transmit it as is, it must calculate the fee based on the actual number of characters contained. In addition, some combinations of letters or numbers written in the telegram text, because they have exceeded the length stipulated by the telegraph office, must be counted as two or more characters according to the regulations. In such cases, two character counts are often noted in the character count field, separated by a fraction slash. For example, 35/32 means that although the telegram only has thirty-two characters, the telegraph office is charging for thirty-five characters. When you receive a telegram and find that the words and sentences in the telegram text are difficult to interpret, you may want to carefully count the characters below the telegram header to see if it matches the number of characters recorded in the character count field in the telegram header (if there is a fraction slash, the number after the slash should be used as the standard). If they do not match, then it is likely that the telegraph office has omitted one or more characters, and you can contact the telegraph office to investigate and supplement it. (To be continued)

### A Tour of the Shanghai Telegraph Office General Business Office

— Ding Hua

The rapidly advancing telecommunications industry has transformed the entire world.

Going east on Fuzhou Road, near the Bund, at the corner of Sichuan Road, stands a four-story building, the Shanghai Telegraph Office General Business Office. This massive organization, which controls the national telecommunications hub, should have a considerable impression in the minds of the public! Because telecommunications are an indispensable part of transportation, especially in Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the East, which requires it for communication and connection with various places in commerce and economy.

The telegraph flag flies deep in the white clouds - the majestic appearance of the General Business Office

### Overview of the Bureau's Business

— Li Tong

C. Business Department

1.  Telegrams: At the beginning of the Bureau's resumption of operations, the telegram business department had only one location, the General Business Office at No. 70 Fuzhou Road. Occasionally, when market conditions changed, there was a feeling of being overcrowded. To facilitate customers and reduce congestion, twelve branch business offices were established later in the city at No. 25 Changzhi Road, No. 59 Zhongshan South Road, and within the post office branches on Fujian Road, Yuyuan Road, Sinan Road, and Jinling East Road, as well as at the North Railway Station public telephone station, the Nanshi Pudong Wusong Minhang telephone exchanges, and within the Yokohama Bridge Bureau. In addition, the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road and Linsen Middle Road, the Sichuan Travel Service on Jinling East Road, and the Xinxin Company at No. 182 Guizhou Road were entrusted to collect telegrams. Furthermore, four telegraph kiosks were set up on the platform of the North Railway Station, in the Wenmiao Road Park, on the Bund of Nanjing Road, and at the Longhua Airport. In addition to receiving telegrams, they are also equipped with public telephones and long-distance telephones to meet the occasional needs of customers. At present, it is planned to set up telegraph kiosks at the intersection of Hengshan Road and Baoqing Road, the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Taixing Road, the intersection of Xizang Road and Nanjing Road, and the entrance of Zhongshan Park on Changning Road, in order to provide widespread service. Moreover, for the convenience of customers with local telephones, in addition to being able to notify the Bureau by telephone at any time to send staff to collect telegrams, they can also apply for registration with the Bureau's business section to transmit telegrams by telephone. At the same time, the Bureau's mobile telegraph service also provided telegram receiving services on mobile post office buses No. 1, 2 and 3, and one self-designed mobile telegraph service bus has been opened to circle the city. The bus is equipped with the latest ultra-short wave transceivers, which immediately transmit the received telegrams by machine to ensure speed.

In addition to opening up business branch offices and providing customers with as much convenience as possible, the Bureau has also actively renovated the interior, setting up a public service desk in the General Business Office, providing telegram writing services, answering inquiries, and exchanging small bills. At the same time, a line connection status board and a direct wireless circuit status board are installed to be eye-catching. The latest teletypewriters are used in various business branch offices to transmit telegrams. Recently, a large number of business staff have been added and given short-term training. In addition to telecommunications regulations, they have also been carefully instructed on how to deal with people politely, and they are assessed at any time. Now they are able to implement them effectively and give customers a good impression.

2.  Telephone

Telephone services can be divided into the following three categories:

A. Local Telephone: Due to the current shortage of telephone equipment, although applications for installing local telephones are pouring in, the Bureau is still unable to provide them universally. In order to remedy this shortcoming, public telephones have been installed in various key locations and in the four suburbs of the city. As of now, [one hundred and thirty-nine] public telephones have been installed, distributed throughout the city, and others are still being installed. All locations where public telephones are installed have a special public telephone sign made by the Bureau to make them easy to identify. The local call fee for public telephones is 1,000 yuan in national currency per call, except for long-distance call fees, which are subject to separate regulations. Calls that do not connect are free. If there are any instances of excessive call charges at public telephone locations with the Bureau's public telephone sign, please notify the Bureau in writing at any time so that they can be investigated.

B. Domestic Long-Distance Telephone: After the victory, the focus of long-distance telephone work also focused on the three points of "connection," "smoothness," and "speed." Those that are not connected should be connected, those that are connected should be smooth, and after smoothness, speed should be sought. The speed of the domestic long-distance telephone network in our country has been astonishing in the past two years. As of now, there are 187 locations that can communicate with Shanghai, including Taipei, Chongqing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Nanjing. Recently, the Bureau has printed a price list for long-distance telephone calls, which includes the use of long-distance telephones, call locations, prices, and circuit diagrams. If you need it, please ask the Bureau's business section at No. 70 Fuzhou Road or No. 1761 Sichuan North Road for it, free of charge.

C. International Wireless Telephone: The Bureau opened international wireless telephone services before the Anti-Japanese War, which were temporarily suspended during the war. Starting from July 1 this year, Sino-US wireless telephone services were restored first, and other places such as Manila and London are also being tested. If the test results are good, they will be opened one after another.

### Tales of Shanghai Telecommunications History

— Sun Hongjun

Shanghai was known in ancient times as a coastal saline land. It belonged to the states and counties of Yang, Wu, Yue, and Chu successively. In the Song Dynasty, it was first established as a town, and then changed to a county seat, until the Ming and Qing Dynasties. In the 23rd year of Daoguang (1843 AD), after the Opium War ended, it was opened as a port for trade between China and foreign countries, and the British and French concessions were established. At that time, European and American science flourished, and transportation undertakings became increasingly developed. At that time, enlightened people of the Qing government also realized that transportation undertakings had a close relationship with a country's economy and culture. Therefore, the Tianjin-Shanghai Telegraph Bureau was established with the approval of Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Trade for the Northern Ports and Governor-General of Zhili of the Former Qing Dynasty, to lay the foundation for our country's telecommunications industry. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, Shanghai was established as a city. Since then, commerce has flourished, the population has been dense, and the use of telecommunications has become increasingly widespread.

Time flies. It has been more than seventy years since our country started telecommunications. There have been many changes in the meantime, and the expansion, progress, and improvement of the telecommunications industry have been countless. Now, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Bureau's restoration, I will collect the historical traces of Shanghai telecommunications, select the most prominent ones, and briefly list the outlines in chronological order, for the world's telecommunications concerns to understand its origin and end!

### Introduction to Business Inspection

— Jiang Junren

Telecommunications is a kind of public utility, or to put it bluntly, a commercial institution with a relatively large scope. However, stores specialize in selling goods to customers, while the telegraph office does not sell goods, but specializes in providing communication convenience to customers. The business policy of general stores is how to cater to the psychology of customers and make their business thrive. Our telegraph office is no exception, so in order to understand the psychology of the public and improve the business according to the opinions of the public, the authorities have established a business inspection office directly under the business office. The duties of the business inspection office are, on the one hand, to solicit and collect opinions from the public on the Bureau's business, and on the other hand, to inspect and assess the efficiency of the Bureau's staff. Before the war, the work objects of the business inspection office were relatively simple, because the Bureau's business was not as developed as it is today. The business was idle, and the work of business inspection was also simple: as long as we paid attention to the efficiency of the staff and ensured that each telegram arrived within the prescribed time, we could rest easy. Now it is not the case. The number of incoming and outgoing telegrams has increased tenfold, but the Bureau does not have many machines, and there is such a shortage of manpower, and the staff must be specially trained to be competent. It takes half a year to train the new recruits recruited from outside. The manpower graduated from the Bureau's own training institute every year cannot meet this huge demand. Due to the above two difficulties, there are inevitably occasional delays in incoming and outgoing telegrams. For this problem, we have also racked our brains to deal with and improve it in various ways, but it is difficult to have significant progress before we can obtain enough new machines and enough manpower. However, we are not discouraged. On the contrary, we believe that this difficulty can be overcome by human efforts. We can see from the statistical figures of the recent months that the business is improving day by day.

In this monthly increasing number of words, it is even more worth mentioning that the number of complaints from users due to dissatisfaction does not increase because of it. This shows that our efforts are becoming effective. We are even more grateful to the outside world for constantly giving us well-intentioned suggestions and assistance, so that we can gradually improve our business.

In order to deeply understand the opinions of general users on the Bureau, the inspection office sends out an average of more than a thousand inspection letters every month, asking users to directly send their opinions to the office, and then the office will collect the above opinions and notify the relevant departments of the Bureau to improve them. We must also be responsible for supervising their improvement to ensure that they meet the expectations of users. For example, business inspectors must often go to various business offices to assess the work of business staff and inspect the general conditions of various business offices. We saw the crowded situation at the Bureau's General Business Office on Fuzhou Road, and studied the crux of the problem. We found that one reason was that the market prices fluctuated不定, making the busyness of telegrams uncertain; the second reason was that senders failed to make full use of their nearby branch business offices. We hope that readers will use the nearby branch business offices if they want to send telegrams in the future. Its effectiveness is exactly the same as that of the General Business Office, and it can reduce the suffering of congestion for both senders and business staff.

Regarding the telephone part. The inspection office must go out to inspect the charging situation of public telephones in the city. We often find that the firms managing public telephones do not charge according to the prescribed prices. This is very regrettable. We should know that the purpose of the telegraph office setting up public telephones is entirely to facilitate the public, because there is a shortage of equipment after the war and it cannot meet the needs of the public as much as possible. Residential and business telephones are installed, so public telephones are installed everywhere, so that every citizen can enjoy the convenience of telephones. Therefore, we hope that firms managing public telephones will not use public telephones as a tool for their own profit, but should provide more services. This is the common wish of the telegraph office and the public.

In summary, the responsibility of the business inspection office is to seek contact with the outside world, so we very much welcome readers. Please provide as many opinions as possible on the areas of the Bureau's business that need improvement, so that we can get more reference and know what should be promoted and what should be reformed.

Inspection Office Address:

No. 70 Fuzhou Road

The writer took advantage of a coincidence to make a simple tour of the General Business Office of the Telegraph Bureau. What I saw is introduced below:

As soon as you enter the door, the spacious space, the neat layout, and the beautified decoration will first give you a good impression. The wired and wireless circuit obstruction boards are arranged on the central pillars, so you can see at a glance where the telegram is smooth and where it is blocked. Four or five sofas are quietly leaning against the wall, waiting for the sender's little rest. In the corner on the left, there is a public telephone booth, next to the public service desk. A young staff member is busy writing telegrams for people and answering inquiries from senders. There is a telephone on the table, which is probably specially prepared for customers to use at any time!

At this time, a kind Mr. came out from inside. He told me a lot of valuable materials and also pointed out a lot of common sense on telegrams.

"This is a model business office," he said, "so the equipment is relatively complete. The many charts that are revealed are specially for senders to refer to."

"Telegram Price List", "Sender's Notice", "Location Map of Various Business Offices in the City", "Wired and Wireless Reachable Route Map", and "Social Telegram True Telegram Format", etc., he explained to me one by one.

"These are many undeliverable telegrams," he pointed to the announcements plastered in the glass frame, and continued, "These telegrams are posted for collection because the address is unknown or the recipient has moved."

"Excuse me, what steps do you have to go through to send a telegram?" I turned the topic around.

The following is the conversation with that Mr.:

"There are seventeen windows here - regular telegrams are at windows No. 1 to No. 4 on the left hand side, urgent telegrams are at windows No. 12 to No. 15 on the right side, express telegrams are at windows No. 7 to No. 9 in the middle, other military officer telegrams are at No. 10 and No. 11, and true telegrams and social telegrams are at No. 16 and No. 17. To send a telegram, first find the appropriate window, hand the filled-in telegram to the staff inside, and after calculating the number of words and issuing a receipt, you can pay at the nearby window. When the cashier hands you the receipt stamped with the cash register date, the procedure is complete. When there are many people crowded, the senders must line up in order, so that the order can be kept in order. Recently, the crowding situation has been reduced after the establishment of business offices in various places in the city."

"Excuse me, what is the total number of business operations every day at the moment?" I asked.

"The Shanghai Bureau sends an average of 5,000 telegrams every day, with a total business volume of about 170 million. The General Business Office accounts for about 80% of this. The business situation is probably related to the market situation. When prices fluctuate, telecommunications become more frequent, and the peak has been more than 10,000 telegrams!"

"How long does it take for a telegram to arrive?"

"It depends on the road conditions on that day. Under normal circumstances, regular telegrams arrive within 8 hours, urgent telegrams arrive within 4 hours, and the fastest express telegrams arrive within only one and a half hours."

"But sometimes the telegrams you send are wrong. What is the reason for this?" "There are many reasons for this, including errors on the part of the Bureau and errors on the part of the sender. For example, telegrams are prone to errors when there are line obstacles. On the sender's side, sometimes the code is translated incorrectly, or the telegram is written unclearly, which can also cause errors."

"Oh, I saw in the newspaper that your male and female managers here have been trained, right?"

"That's right. The Bureau's business staff must receive at least three months of special training, and they are very familiar with business regulations, service attitude, and telecommunications common sense."

I focused my eyes on the faces of the male and female staff sitting at each window, all of whom were wearing uniforms, dignified and solemn, and working non-stop under tense emotions.

Five minutes later, I said goodbye and came back. I was impressed by the thoughtful service of the telecommunications authorities, and I was even more admiring of the progress of science. Human power has finally overcome the difficulties of the natural environment. People who are separated by the ends of the earth can communicate with each other and pass on messages. The rapidly advancing telecommunications industry has transformed the entire world.

### Anecdotes of Telecommunications Administration

The world's first Chinese telephone user: The San Francisco telephone directory lists the world's first Chinese telephone user. The user's original name was Zhan Guang (transliteration). He has been renting a telephone from the San Francisco Telephone Bureau for 55 years. Mr. Zhan went to the United States to do business at the age of 16. In 1878, the San Francisco Telephone Bureau was opened, and Mr. Zhan was the first to rent a telephone. Later, telephones gradually developed, and the number of Chinese telephone users in San Francisco has increased to thousands. Mr. Zhan himself passed away in 1918, and now his two grandsons are still in the city inheriting the ancestral business.

Corrupt officials in the Qing Dynasty had to kneel and bow to pay their respects to senior officials whenever they saw them. The same was true for the Telegraph Bureau. Students who were sent to schools had to kowtow to the head of the school, and those who were sent to a certain bureau had to kowtow to the head of the bureau. It was ridiculous.

First television test: The first test of transmitting human figures on television was on April 1927. Outdoor tests were conducted in 1928, and color tests were conducted in 1929. However, it was limited to the human figure on one side.

It has been a long time since report personnel were transferred to the Ministry to handle affairs. The earliest ones were Zhang Daohai, who is now working at the Beiping Bureau, followed by Cheng Anheng and Chen Xizhou, both of whom were in the second year of the Republic of China. At that time, Mr. Zhang was transferred to the Foreign Report Section of the old Ministry of Communications to handle affairs, and Cheng Chen Erkan was transferred to the Business Section to handle affairs. Now only Mr. Cheng is still working in the Personnel Section of the Electric Department. Colleagues respect him as a senior, which can be said to be as magnificent as the Lingguang Hall of Lu.

### Television in America

— Ordinary

Television is no longer an industry in its infancy in the United States. In the past seven months, the United States has spent US$17 million on television receivers. According to the estimate of the Victory Wireless Company, since November 1946, various companies have sold 43,000 television receivers. There are now eight companies in the United States manufacturing and selling television receivers. Their prices range from about $300 to $2,500. In the past eight months, six cities in the United States have added television equipment, and the sales in the New York City market are still the most extensive.

Furthermore, according to the prediction of Emerson Radio and Phonograph Corporation, the output of television receivers in the United States this year will be 250,000 units, and in 1948, it will increase to 1.5 million units. Due to the improvement of manufacturing technology and the increase in production volume, the price of television receivers may be greatly reduced within a few months.

Recently, Philco Radio Corporation has produced a television receiver with a very large display screen, and its brightness is four times greater than that of ordinary televisions.

Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei attaches great importance to the postal and telecommunications business in Beijing and Shanghai. He has specially appointed Mr. Zhang Kewen, technical officer of the Ministry of Transportation, Fan Yutang, secretary of the Design and Assessment Committee, Min Yongchuan, engineer of the Postal and Telecommunications Department, Shen Binglu, chief inspector of the Telecommunications Administration, and Hong Sunxiang, inspector of the Postal Administration, to come to Shanghai for inspection.

The inspection team arrived at our bureau at 9:00 am on August 28th, and a symposium was held in the conference room of our bureau. First, Technical Officer Zhang indicated the goal of this inspection, focusing on the implementation of the work in the first half of the year, the improvement of future business, and related personnel and materials, and the status of business revenue and expenditure. Then, Secretary Fan inquired about the implementation of the work in our bureau from February to June, the improvement of business status, and the work plan for the second half of the year. Director Li of the Business Department of our bureau and other department heads gave detailed answers.

On the morning of August 29th, the inspection of the general office of our bureau, Hongkou Exchange, Long Distance Station, Training Institute, etc. began. In the afternoon, the inspection of the Tian Tong Road Branch of our bureau, the International Telegraph Office, the Coastal Radio Station, and the warehouses of our bureau. On August 30th, the inspection of the Fuzhou Road General Business Office, Nanshi Exchange, Pudong Exchange, and various branch business offices of our bureau. On September 1st, the inspection of the Zhenru transmitting station of the International Radio Station and the Nanxiang transmitting station of our bureau. On September 2nd, the inspection of the Liuhang receiving station of the International Radio Station.

The inspection team completed their official duties and left Shanghai on September 5th. (Pei)
