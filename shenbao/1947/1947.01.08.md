### Ma Envoy Summoned to Return Home This Morning; Issues Departure Statement Before Leaving, Saying China Has Laid a Democratic Foundation

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Conner, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy, announced on the morning of the 7th that Special Envoy Marshall had received instructions from President Truman to return home and report on everything. Special Envoy Marshall has decided to depart from Nanjing for the United States on an American military plane at 8:00 AM on the 8th. At noon on the 7th, Envoy Marshall hosted a banquet at his residence, inviting Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, Ambassador Stuart, and his personal advisor Fu Jingbo. It was also decided that Communist Party delegation secretary Zhang Wenjin would meet with him in the evening for discussions. Song Ziwen flew back to Nanjing from Shanghai at 4:00 PM and went to Envoy Marshall's residence at 5:00 PM for lengthy talks, reportedly regarding the $500 million loan. Many Chinese and foreign reporters visited Envoy Marshall today, requesting a farewell speech, but Envoy Marshall remained silent. Subsequently, several reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai jointly submitted a written inquiry with three questions, requesting an interview for answers. At that time, President Song happened to enter, and Marshall dispatched Deputy Adjutant Yin to meet with them, declaring: Envoy Marshall's return home is at the summons of President Truman and there is nothing else to report, therefore he does not intend to grant an interview, and there is no need to answer the three questions raised. President Chiang and his wife specially hosted a banquet at their official residence on the evening of the 7th to bid farewell to Envoy Marshall.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 7th, Broadcast: President Chiang met with General Marshall tonight and informed him of China's democratic reform plan. Prior to this, President Song also visited Marshal Marshall this afternoon, explaining the administrative plans of the Chinese government and declaring that the Kuomintang's one-party rule, monopolizing power, has come to an end with the return of power to the people.

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] For over a year, Envoy Marshall has tirelessly mediated the disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. After departing from Beijing this time, Ambassador Stuart Leighton will solely represent the United States in future negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the weather is favorable, Envoy Marshall, accompanied by Colonel Gose, will depart from Nanjing Airport tomorrow, likely taking a route via Honolulu to return to the United States.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Officials today confirmed that President Truman has telegraphed Special Envoy Marshall to return home to report on his duties. Envoy Marshall is expected to fly from Nanjing to Washington around Tuesday of this week. When a reporter asked President Secretary Ross whether Envoy Marshall would still return to China, Ross replied: "I am not prepared to answer any questions, but Marshal Marshall's return home is an officially announced piece of news." According to the official announcement: "The President has telegraphed Marshal Marshall to return to Washington to personally report on the situation in China. He may depart from Nanjing as early as tomorrow."

[Our Report] San Francisco, 7th, Broadcast: General Marshall's departure statement from China was released by the U.S. side today. The full text of the statement consists of 1,200 words. It is said that the Chinese government is about to reorganize its government in accordance with the new constitution. Marshal Marshall pointed out optimistically: "The foundation of a democratic China has already been laid." Marshal Marshall stated clearly that this peace talk was sabotaged by extremist elements and strongly condemned the malicious propaganda of the Chinese Communist Party, which distorted the facts in an attempt to incite the Chinese people and others to resentment and hostility towards the United States. Marshal Marshall believes that only the establishment of a free and democratic government can save China.

Marshall also said: The agreement reached by the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at the Political Consultative Conference a year ago was indeed a charter for democratic progress, sufficient to lay the foundation for China's peaceful reconstruction. It is a pity that stubborn elements within the Kuomintang still want to preserve their feudal forces and clearly have no sincerity in fulfilling the resolution.

Marshal Marshall pointed out that the biggest obstacle to peace talks is the mutual suspicion between the two sides.

Marshall further stated: "I express my views in extremely frank terms. This is the only way I can enable the American people to partially understand this complex issue. On the one hand, the leaders of the Chinese Kuomintang resolutely oppose a communist government. On the other hand, the Communist Party also frankly admits that they are Marxists. Although they may initially agree to the establishment of an Anglo-American-style democratic government, their aim is still to establish a communist government."

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Zhang Wenjin, the English secretary of the Chinese Communist Party delegation, went to meet Special Envoy Marshall at about 5:00 PM on the 7th at the latter's invitation. Since Zhang had been in contact with Envoy Marshall from time to time during the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks over the past year, he went to meet and talk with him for nearly an hour before his departure. However, Envoy Marshall only made a general statement, saying that all issues would be discussed after returning to the United States. This may refer to the fact that a formal reply from the U.S. government will be determined after a report to Washington.

### Military Mediation Department Personnel Talk; Marshall Will Still Return to China; Policy Towards China Unlikely to Change

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Reactions from the Military Mediation Department regarding Marshall's return home: (1) Zheng Jiemin, a government member of the Military Mediation Department, told reporters: Marshal Marshall's return home is to report on the situation in China to Congress. He believes that the United States will not change its policy towards China, and there is no possibility of changing the mediator, because the United States currently has no more suitable candidate than Marshal Marshall. (2) Cai Wenzhi, Chief of Staff of the Military Mediation Department, told reporters: I had heard before that Marshal Marshall was about to return home, so I am not surprised at all. He predicted that Marshal Marshall would still return to China to continue mediating, and the Military Mediation Department would continue to exist. He denied the rumors that the Military Mediation Department would be cancelled. (3) Ye Jianying, the Communist Party member of the Military Mediation Department, told reporters that there had been rumors for a long time that Marshall would return home, but after receiving Truman's telegram on the 6th, he immediately departed for the United States, and his hurried departure was indeed noteworthy. In his judgment, Marshall's return home was prompted by two situations: First, the recent victories of the Communist army in Shuyang, Taierzhuang, and other places have made the U.S. government feel that the problem cannot be solved by force. Second, the incident of a 19-year-old Chinese girl being raped, which caused a major national disturbance in China, must have made the U.S. government realize that their policy towards China has angered the Chinese people. This time, Truman recalled Marshall, probably to hear a report on the situation in China and re-examine the policy towards China. As a result, there are only two possibilities: either further strengthening the wrong policy towards China, or making some limited changes to the policy towards China. In answering reporters' questions, he believed that the Military Mediation Department no longer made sense. Marshall and Robertson have left, and only we are still supporting it here. In fact, we should have packed our bags and left long ago. He believes that there is no basis for resuming peace talks now.

### After Marshall Returns Home; Rumors Suggest He Will Be Appointed Secretary of State

Policy Towards China May Change

[United Press, New York, 7th] According to Reston, the Washington correspondent for the New York Times, after Marshal Marshall returns home, Washington will inquire about the situation in China and whether he will stay in Washington for a long time. If it is permissible, he will be invited to serve as Assistant Secretary of State, and further replace Byrnes as Secretary of State, as the latter intends to retire.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] Well-informed sources here recently detailed the recall of U.S. Special Envoy to China Marshall. Briefly stated, after Marshal Marshall consults with President Truman, the State Department, and leaders of the new Congress, the United States will draft its new policy towards China.

### Democratic League Continues to Meet

Determines That the League Is Still a Political Group

[Our Report] The Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League held its third meeting yesterday morning. Chairman Zhang Bojun made a detailed review of the work in the meeting. The fourth meeting continued in the afternoon, chaired by Zhang Shenfu. The Review Committee submitted eight proposals and twenty-eight points of opinion regarding the organizational part. Regarding the organization of the Democratic League, there are three important decisions: (1) Regardless of whether they have party affiliation, those participating in the Democratic League do so in their individual capacity. After joining the League, they must abide by the League's political views and resolutions; otherwise, they are requested to withdraw from the League. (2) It is determined that the Democratic League is an unarmed group that realizes democracy. (3) The nature of the Democratic League is still a political group, absorbing democratic elements from all strata, rather than a single political party.

Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Xu Kan, and many other relevant leaders attended. Chairman Wang Chonghui discussed it based on the Resident Committee of the Political Council's general review report on the general budget. A part of it has been accepted, and a part will be reviewed.

### National Assembly Mongolian Representatives Petitioned the Executive Yuan Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Twelve National Assembly Mongolian representatives, including Wu Yunpeng, petitioned the Executive Yuan at 11:00 AM on the 7th, raising four requests: (1) Restore the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee; (2) Implement the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session regarding border ethnic issues; (3) Allocate 10 billion to relieve the three million Mongolian compatriots who have withdrawn from Nenjiang to Xinjiang; (4) Reorganize the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission.

### New Difficulties Added to Peace Talks; Zhang Qun Held Lengthy Talks with Zhang Junmai, Zuo Shunsheng, etc. Yesterday, Exchanging Opinions on the Current Situation from Various Aspects

[Central News Agency, City News] At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhang Qun and Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party, Zuo Shunsheng and Li Huang of the Youth Party, had a lengthy talk at a certain place, exchanging opinions on the current situation from various aspects. The government reorganization issue, which is currently attracting social attention, and the issue of restoring peace talks were all touched upon. The analysis was quite detailed, but no conclusions were reached. Zhang Qun also hopes to continue the talks in the coming days. The rumor that Zhang will return to Beijing in the coming days is completely inaccurate. A reporter visited Zuo Shunsheng, a spokesman for the Chinese Youth Party, at 8:00 PM yesterday and asked various questions. Zuo answered them one by one as follows:

Q: I heard that you have met with Zhang Qun. Can you tell me about the content?

A: The scope of the discussion was very broad, covering the restoration of peace talks, government reorganization, and General Marshall's return home.

Q: What is your opinion on the peace talks?

A: We have always advocated continuing to solve the Chinese Communist Party issue through political methods. Although some new difficulties have been added at present, there is still a way to solve it if all parties can pay attention to reality.

Q: What is your party's opinion on government reorganization?

A: This issue is extremely complex and needs to be seriously considered. We believe that the concrete method of solving the current situation is more important than whether or not to participate in the government. We are conducting a detailed exploration of the key to solving the current situation, and there are no conclusions that can be reported.

Q: What are your feelings about Marshall's return home?

A: We are very impressed with General Marshall's mediation efforts for China over the past year, and we believe that his hard work has not been in vain. China's peaceful reunification and democratic construction are still valued by friendly countries. The U.S. policy may have some technical modifications, but the basic spirit will not change. We hope that because of Marshall's return home, the United States can further enhance its understanding of the Chinese issue.

[Another Report] Important figures from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have been visiting each other for days, exchanging opinions on the current situation and the issue of government reorganization. At noon on the 7th, the Youth Party held a banquet at the International Hotel for all the Standing Committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party, which did not end until 2:00 PM in the afternoon. It is said that it was only "a social gathering."

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Jiang Yuntian, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, returned to Beijing from Anhui on the 6th and is scheduled to go to Shanghai by military plane on the night of the 7th to participate in the organizational committee of the Democratic Socialist Party. Jiang visited Shao Lizi today. A reporter visited Jiang tonight and asked him to express his views on Special Envoy Marshall's return home. According to him, Special Envoy Marshall has made his greatest efforts in our country's peace negotiations over the past year. Although he has not succeeded, he has really done his best. Therefore, I hope that he can come to China again. Also, Yu Chao, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, traveled to Shanghai in the same car as Jiang.

[Our Report] Zhang Bojun gave a general discussion on the overall situation to our reporter, believing that the basic work at present is not how to reorganize the government, but for the government to wholeheartedly study the issues of peace talks, ceasefire, and overall unity and cooperation. In order to avoid the division of China, a new basis for peace talks must be found. This requires people from all walks of life to pool their wisdom and provide opinions, and to strive in the direction of reducing the difficulties of peace talks, and not to move in the direction of increasing difficulties. Regarding Special Envoy Marshall's return to the United States, he said: Marshall returned home because he felt the mediation mission was difficult. He hopes that the overall situation in our country will not worsen after his departure. It is best for the Chinese to solve their own problems independently.

### China National Aviation Corporation Sends Personnel to Qingdao to Handle the Aftermath of the Accident; Dai Anguo Comes to Shanghai to Inspect the Equipment of the Two Companies

[Our Report] Gao Dajing, director of the business group of China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), flew to Qingdao at 11:00 AM on the 7th with American personnel from the company's aviation group to handle the aftermath of the victims of the CNAC's No. 121 aircraft that crashed in Qingdao and the pilots. At present, the company has not received a detailed report on the exact extent of the aircraft's damage. How to bury the corpses, transport the coffins, and other related issues will all be decided after Gao arrives in Qingdao.

According to the company's spokesperson, the details of the plane crash will be reported to the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications for expert study to determine responsibility.

[Our Report] Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Beijing today to inspect the flight equipment of China and Central Aviation Corporation.

Shen Dexie, General Manager of CNAC, and Chen Zhuolin, General Manager of CATC, were ordered by the Ministry of Communications to go to Beijing to report and arrived in Beijing yesterday morning. In addition to reporting the recent plane crash situation, they will also discuss improving various civil aviation issues.

[Central News Agency, City News] The Snow Relief Committee, organized by the relatives of the passengers who died in the plane crash on Christmas Day, held its first meeting of the Standing Committee at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. More than ten people, including Le Junwei, Zhou Zhongdi, and Lu Linping, attended and immediately resolved to request the court in the name of the committee to file a lawsuit and legally investigate and deal with the company authorities. The resolution was also telegraphed to the Ministry of Communications and other relevant agencies for record. Other matters will be discussed at the second meeting to be held on the 11th (Tuesday).

### Ministry of Communications Thoroughly Investigates the Cause; Affixes Responsibility for the Accident

And Discusses Flight Safety Measures

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Chen Zhuolin and Shen Debian, the General Managers of CNAC and CATC, arrived in Beijing together from Shanghai at 10:30 AM on the morning of the 7th. Then at 12:00 PM, they rushed to the Ministry of Communications to meet with Li Jinghuang, Director of the Navigation Affairs Department, and Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, to report on the investigation of the Shanghai air crash case on Christmas and the handling of the previous Qingdao air crash case, and to discuss ways to improve flight safety in the future. Afterwards, Director Dai told reporters. He will take a military plane to Shanghai on the night of the 7th to conduct a final investigation of the Shanghai air crash case. Although the two companies bear huge losses due to the Ministry of Communications' order to suspend passenger flights for one week except for cargo and mail, it is irreversible. It is necessary for the aviation industry to frequently check aircraft and airport equipment to make planned improvements, and it is also a guarantee for the safety of passengers. Dai also stated that the Ministry of Communications attaches great importance to the recent series of plane crashes and is determined to thoroughly investigate the causes and affix responsibilities. However, before the investigation is completed, I hope that all parties will not make too many speculations.

[Our Hankou Office, 7th] After the CNAC plane crashed continuously, public opinion here was critical, believing that the transportation authorities had failed to inspect the equipment in advance, and the temporary order to suspend flights was somewhat abnormal. They also warned the two companies to improve the equipment at Wuchang Airport or relocate as soon as possible.

He said: "After the work of the Civil Aviation Administration is launched, it will definitely reduce the occurrence of such unfortunate tragedies, even to the point of eliminating them."

### U.S. Note to China and the Soviet Union; Urges Opening of Dalian Port and Restoration of Traffic on the China Changchun Railway

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 6th] The U.S. government believes that Dalian Port, which is currently occupied by the Soviet Union, should be reopened to international trade under Chinese management in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Agreement of August 1945, and there is no reason to delay it further. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow delivered this intention in a diplomatic note to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 3, and a similar diplomatic note was delivered to the Chinese government at the same time. The content of the diplomatic note is as follows:

"Regarding the status and management of the seaport of Dalian, the current situation is very unsatisfactory. The U.S. government believes that this matter should be considered by the Chinese and Soviet governments as soon as possible in order to fulfill the section of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of August 14, 1945, concerning Dalian. The U.S. government believes that the port should be reopened to international trade under Chinese management in accordance with the above agreement, and there is no reason to delay it further. The U.S. government is well aware that this is a matter directly negotiated by the Chinese and Soviet governments. However, in terms of the general interests of the United States, it is necessary to raise this issue with the relevant governments of both parties. The U.S. government hopes that the current abnormal state in Dalian can be ended in the short term and that normal conditions can be restored so as to allow U.S. citizens to visit and reside in Dalian and conduct their legitimate work.

Regarding the above points, this government further hopes that China and the Soviet Union can restore traffic on the China Changchun Railway in the short term.

The agreement reached by China and the Soviet Union on the issues of Dalian and the China Eastern Railway, if implemented in the short term, will surely restore normal conditions in the Far East and benefit commercial activities in all aspects. Therefore, this government sincerely hopes that the Chinese and Soviet governments will ensure that the above steps can be taken in the short term."

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The State Department announced that the U.S. government has asked China and the Soviet Union to end Soviet military control in Dalian as soon as possible and reopen it to international trade under Chinese management without further delay. This is the first step taken by the U.S. official after the Soviet authorities refused to allow three U.S. civilians to land in Dalian on December 12 and ordered the U.S. Navy communication ship carrying the three to leave the port within 20 minutes. According to the State Department, the U.S. government simultaneously ordered its ambassadors to Nanjing and Moscow to deliver the note to the foreign ministries of China and the Soviet Union on January 3. The Soviet side ordered the U.S. ship to leave the port within 20 minutes after the ship had been moored for more than the 48-hour stipulated period. State Department officials believe that the Soviet Union's move was within its rights and were unwilling to criticize the nature of the so-called ultimatum and the order to leave the port within a limited time.

### Military Needs No Longer Exist; The Soviet Union Should Return Dalian Immediately; We Welcome the U.S. Note

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] After the U.S. State Department issued a note to China and the Soviet Union on the 3rd, hoping that the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the takeover of Dalian would be completed as soon as possible and the Sino-Soviet Treaty would be implemented so that Dalian would become a free commercial port under Chinese jurisdiction, all sectors of Beijing attached great importance to this. He Fengshan, Director of the Information Department and spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters who were inquiring about the official reaction to the matter in the afternoon of the 7th: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already received this note, but it is not yet known whether Foreign Minister Wang will issue a statement on this matter or wait until the Sino-Soviet negotiations have a result before announcing it together."

[United Press, Beijing, 7th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today confirmed that it had received the U.S. note on the Dalian issue and expressed its welcome, believing that the U.S. move could promote the early return of Dalian to China. Although Foreign Minister Wang Shijie did not directly express his opinion, other officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: It is hoped that the Soviet Union will declare that the jurisdiction of Dalian will be transferred to China in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty. There is no treaty basis for the Soviet army's occupation of Dalian, but it was a temporary expedient measure taken by the military authorities at the time due to the needs of the war against Japan. These military needs no longer exist. The relations between the United States, China, and the Soviet Union on this entire issue are related to the treaty, and there is no dispute. China hopes that the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the Sino-U.S. Treaty can be implemented as soon as possible. China does not intend to take any action regarding the U.S. note for the time being before the Soviet Union expresses its attitude in Moscow. Note: After Japan's surrender, the Soviet government notified the Chinese government on May 23 last year that the Soviet army had completely withdrawn from the three northeastern provinces, which proves that Moscow believes that the war against Japan has ended.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 7th, Broadcast: The U.S. government has taken a tough stance on the Dalian issue, and U.S. newspapers have unanimously praised it. The New York Times said: The State Department's action has reversed its original attitude, restored the U.S. open door policy towards China, and opposed a certain power from seizing privileges from China.

### Lu Nan Communist Army Offensive Stalled; Fierce Attacks on Yixian and Taierzhuang Fail; 5,000 Communist Troops Flee into Hao County, Northern Anhui

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 7th] Since Chen Yi led a force of tens of thousands of Communist troops to launch a large-scale offensive on the northeastern outskirts of Xuzhou starting on the 3rd, they have suffered heavy losses. On the 5th and 6th, they continued to fiercely attack strongholds near Yixian, Taierzhuang, Pixian, and Zaozhuang. The area east of the Taizao Line was the site of fierce, intertwined offensive and defensive battles day and night. By the 6th, due to the strengthening of the National Army's strength, the Communist Army's offensive began to stall.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th] Military News: The Communist armies in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu have recently launched a bandit-style campaign of harassment. The National Army on all fronts has been forced to adopt self-defense tactics, and the fighting is taking place in freezing weather. Details are as follows: (1) The Communist troops advancing along the Taizao Line to spy on Taierzhuang, after capturing Xiangcheng (formerly the ancient state of Xiang), were blocked by a powerful unit of the National Army, and their offensive momentum was slightly reduced. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army near Yishan. The Communist troops on this line have suffered nearly 10,000 casualties in the last three days. Taierzhuang, one of the cities that resisted the war, is now heavily guarded by a large force of the National Army and is safe. The Hezhao Line (Taierzhuang to Zhaozhuang Station on the Longhai Railway) is still under the control of the National Army. (2) The Communist troops who bypassed Zaobing to the northwest and attempted to invade Maziyangzhuang on the west bank of the Grand Canal, after being intercepted and attacked by the National Army's Huang Division and Liang Brigade along the way, are now fleeing back to Qushe and Lujia Dashe. This group of Communist troops is attempting to break up into smaller units and flee to the mountainous areas of the Jiangsu-Anhui border area and Honghu to establish new bases. (3) Gaodunbu has been turned from danger to safety. The National Army stationed in Nanxinan Town is protecting refugees from Shuyang returning to their hometowns and advancing towards Shuyang. The Communist troops in Shuyang are showing signs of wavering. (4) The elite troops of the National Army's Liang Bo Department have arrived at the port. A small group of Communist troops who attempted to sneak attack the port and cut off the Kotai Highway were reported to be harassing the border between Jingtai on the front lines. The National Army on that line has now been ordered to implement the "Qingxiang" (clearing the countryside) policy.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 7th] More than 5,000 troops of the Communist Army's Wei Fenglou Department have fled into Hao County in northern Anhui, posing a threat to the county seat.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 7th] On the 6th, the National Army in Lianshui advanced and stationed in strongholds such as Wugangkou and Daxingji. The Communist troops in Nanxinan Town wavered and retreated to the Dayishan (east of Shuyang) area. The National Army entered Nanxinan Town that evening.

### Signs of Communist Army Moving Inland from Outside the Pass; Four Brigades Flee into Eastern Hebei; Communist Army in Western Shanxi Attacks Puxian and Daning

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th] Sources say: there are signs that the Communist army is transferring a part of its main force from outside the pass to inside the pass. Four new brigades have arrived from outside the pass in the area of Shangwuling and Xinglongshan, forty li north of Ninglu Xingchazitou in northeastern Hebei, and there is a trend of advancing southward. The anti-traitor work in eastern Hebei, which is underway, is therefore being constrained. The Communist army formation on the Songhua River in the northeast has recently shown signs of dispersing. The so-called "winter offensive" seems to be a thing of the past. Small guerrilla units are now active again. The large army that had gathered along the north bank of the Songhua River in areas such as Taolaizhao, Xiushuidianzi, and Shulan has gradually left recently.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 6th] Military News: It is rumored that most of the Communist troops in Taolaizhao have retreated to Shuangcheng. If this is said to be preparation for abandoning Harbin, it is still too early.

[Our Newspaper, Gaiping, 7th] For the past three days, the reporter has been traveling in areas of the Liaodong Peninsula where the Communist army uses dispersed and assembled tactics. The National Army in Dashiqiao, Gaiping, and Xiong Yue is on high alert, so it is still peaceful. Currently, both sides are continuing to have relatively fierce conflicts in the area north of the Fuxian Tongpiziwo Highway in southern Liaoning. The China Changchun Railway was rushed to repair in the howling cold wind towards Pulandian, and the ice and snow were everywhere, making it extremely difficult.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 7th] The Communist army in western Shanxi has now increased to ten brigades, a total of 50,000 to 60,000 people. Together with the coerced militia, there are about 100,000 people, divided into attacks on Puxian and Daning. The National Army stationed in Jinggou Town has encountered a fierce attack. The Communist troops attacking Puxian were repelled on the 3rd. Currently, the war in that direction is becoming increasingly tense, which is obviously a new offensive attempt by the Communist army.

[Our Newspaper, GuiSui, 6th] The Communist army entered Qingshuihe on the afternoon of the 3rd and has been there for three days. The situation in the city is unknown. It is rumored that the defending regiment commander, Chen Zengfu, was killed in action. Only two county government personnel escaped, and the rest were captured. Currently, the Communist army's outpost is at Liu Si Yaozi, and the National Army's reinforcements have rushed to Tuchengzi. In addition, the two Communist army units of Kang Jianmin and Huang Ziqing from Zuoyun, totaling 1,500 people, entered the vicinity of Tiancheng Village in Liangcheng on the evening of the 5th. At night, the Fengliang telephone line was temporarily destroyed, but communication was restored this morning. As of the time of sending the telegram, there were no signs of continuing to flee north.

The XinJiao Branch Line Will Be Open to Traffic in the Middle of the Month

### Passenger and Freight Trains between Hankou and Zhengzhou Resume; Income of the GuHan Road Increases Sharply

The XinJiao Branch Line Will Be Open to Traffic in the Middle of the Month

Mr. Gui met with reporters from this newspaper at the Friendship Association and said: the task of this trip is to inspect the Guangdong naval institutions and affairs, and to handle the naval ships and materials received in the Guangdong area. There are currently many damaged ships that need to be repaired urgently.

Mr. Gui will go to Huangpu for inspection on the 8th and fly to Hainan on the 9th.

### Yellow River Dike in the Communist Area Has Not Been Repaired; It Will Be Extremely Dangerous When Officially Released; The Water Flow in the Old Course Has Reached the Territory of Heze County

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] According to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission's report to the Water Conservancy Committee on the recent situation of the Yellow River blockage and dike restoration project: on the Huayuankou blockage side, after the old line piles of the mouth were connected on December 11, a large amount of stone was thrown. The mouth is now only 200 meters wide and 2 to 3 meters deep. After widespread stone throwing, the water level has gradually increased. Since December 27, a part of the water has flowed into the old course. On January 1, the head of the diversion canal reached the border of Kaifeng, the water level is about 45 cm, the width is 30 meters, and the flow rate is slightly more than one mile per hour. On the dike restoration side, our dike sections have been completed one after another, only near the Communist-controlled area, they are often obstructed, construction is difficult, and it is impossible to complete as scheduled. The restoration of the dike sections within the Communist area is far from the originally planned standard. It is heard that some even flatten the entire dike section, completely losing its flood control effect, and some have not been repaired at all. The dangerous situation when the entire line is officially released in the future is self-evident.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 7th] According to people from the front line in western Shandong: the water flow in the old course of the Yellow River has reached the territory of Heze County, but the water is very small, only a few meters wide. The old course of the Yellow River is desolate, with very few people. The Communists claim that residents who have moved from the old course are asking the central government for huge sums of money, which is actually another attempt. Since the Communist army captured Juye and Jiaxiang, they have been actively operating along the old course of the Yellow River.

The Delay in Responsibility Lies Entirely with the Communist Party

### Disaster Relief Funds for Riverbed Residents; 15 Billion Distributed

The Delay in Responsibility Lies Entirely with the Communist Party

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Regarding the allocation of relief funds for riverbed residents in the Yellow River blockage and dike restoration project, Communist Party representative Dong Biwu publicly accused the government of failing to quickly pay the funds when he received reporters on the 6th. According to the person in charge of the Water Conservancy Committee to the reporter: For the relief of riverbed residents in the Communist-controlled area, the government specially allocated 15 billion yuan. On the 6th, Director Huo Baoshu of the Administrative Relief Executive signed the document with the Communist Party representatives stationed in Shanghai, and the funds will be transported to the area for distribution. The person in charge pointed out that the responsibility for the delay in transporting the funds for relief should be entirely borne by the Communist Party, because after the government approved the allocation of the funds last year, the Administrative Relief Executive specially discussed with the Communist Party to transport the funds directly to the riverbed area and distribute them door-to-door, and the Administrative Relief Executive, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Bureau, and the Communist Party each sent one person to participate in the distribution work. However, the Communist Party representative expressed disagreement and proposed that all the funds be handed over to the Communist Party representative for handling, and planned to purchase materials in Shanghai and transport them. The opinions were different and held until now. After several discussions, they finally followed the government's suggestion and signed the document in Shanghai. Now the funds will be transported and distributed by the Administrative Relief Executive, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Bureau, and representatives of the four parties from the Communist Party.

### The Water Conservancy Association Replied to Dong Biwu, Explaining the Truth about the Blockage Project; It Hopes That the Communist Party Will Value Public Opinion and Help Complete the Whole Effort

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Yellow River blockage and dike restoration project aims to save more than one million victims in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and to restore the cultivated land of the vast majority of people. This project was planned and implemented by the government in response to repeated appeals and requests from the councils and people's organizations of Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces. According to the original plan, the first step is to block the mouth and restore the dikes, and the second step is to reorganize the flooded area. If the Yellow River is not returned to its old course one day, the flooded area will not be reorganized one day, which means that the more than six million victims who are displaced and homeless cannot return to their homeland one day. The Central Government cares about the people, and it is its unshirkable responsibility. If this project is not successful one day, it will not be able to face the people of the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Moreover, the Huai River is invaded by the Yellow River, and the water conveyance efficiency is destroyed. If the Yellow River does not return to its old course one day, the Huai River will not be rectified one day. The severity of the damage is difficult to calculate. However, because a part of the old course of the Yellow River in the territory of Henan is occupied by the Communist Party, before and after planning and construction, the Central Government hoped that the Communist Party could do its best to assist in the smooth progress of the project. Although there were several consultations with the Communist Party, and agreements were reached several times, during the implementation, the Communist Party obstructed it anytime and anywhere, causing the progress of the project to be delayed again and again, and the completed projects were also repeatedly damaged. However, Communist Party representative Dong Biwu sent letters to the Water Conservancy Committee, the Administrative Relief Executive, and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration on the 3rd, and received the press on the 5th to report on the Yellow River blockage and restoration project, which is expected to be successful soon, and attempted to distort the facts and shirk responsibility. The Water Conservancy Committee replied to Mr. Dong on the 6th, hoping that he would value the lives of the people, understand the Central Government's intention to save the people, and help to complete the blockage and restoration project as soon as possible. The letter also pointed out that it has recently been reported that the Communist Party has a plan to build dams across the river to prevent water from flowing downstream, which means that there is a danger of breaches occurring everywhere on both the north and south banks of the Yellow River, and the two provinces of Henan and Hebei will inevitably suffer another disaster. Therefore, the association specially warned that it hopes that this fact will not occur. If this kind of fact occurs after the blockage, the Communist Party should be responsible for the consequences. In addition, the Water Conservancy Committee gave point-by-point answers based on facts to the four opinions put forward by Mr. Dong:

(1) Regarding what Mr. Dong said: "(1) The work of releasing water must be stopped immediately, and the responsibility for releasing water must be investigated. If the blockage and water release are not stopped immediately, the lives and properties of millions of people downstream should be taken care of in accordance with past promises, and all personnel, materials, and equipment assisting the Yellow River blockage project from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration should be withdrawn immediately. (2) Because the government has destroyed the previous agreements on the Yellow River dike restoration project, the middle and lower reaches dike restoration project and the riverbed residents' relief have not been carried out for five months. Therefore, the Huayuankou blockage project must be postponed for five months, so that during this period, the middle and lower reaches dike restoration project and the relocation and relief of residents can be carried out quickly in accordance with the agreement" The association replied: "The record of the talks of the Chinese Communist Party representatives and the representatives of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Relief Executive on May 18 of the year, the blockage project continues." Also, the Shan Communist Party representative put forward reservations, and the piles and stones should be piled up before Dafan, with no more than two meters beyond the bottom of the river. The so-called "continuing" is of course to continue without interruption of work, to the goal of completing the blockage. There is no doubt about it. Except that the limit of not exceeding two meters beyond the bottom of the river should always be maintained before Dafan, this restriction should no longer be imposed after Dafan. At present, the blockage project has continued to a considerable extent, and it should be completed in time. The Yellow River area spans the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, the area of the flooded area is more than 29,000 square kilometers, the number of displaced people is more than 6,100,000, the area of cultivated land submerged or damaged is more than 17,700,000 mu, and the annual loss of crops is more than 1,500,000 tons. The documents and telegrams from the governments at all levels and the people's organs of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu calling for the early blockage are flying in like snowflakes, and the international community is also concerned about this matter and paying close attention to it. In order to save 6,100,000 victims, restore 17,700,000 mu of cultivated land, and 1,500,000 tons of agricultural products per year, the Central Government must seek the early completion of the blockage project and cannot abandon its due responsibilities because someone is deliberately obstructing it. As for the allegation that the number of governments has violated the agreement, not only has the Central Government never abandoned the agreement in handling this matter, but on the contrary, the Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly destroyed important equipment in the Wangkui stone field, and used force to prevent border engineering and employees from entering the Communist-controlled area for work, and plundered and blocked the restoration materials, which is ironclad evidence of deliberate destruction.

(2) Regarding what Mr. Dong said, "The government's work funds must be paid quickly, and the minimum amount of 15 billion for the relief of riverbed residents should be delivered on schedule in accordance with the Shanghai agreement of July last year, and should not be delayed on the grounds of arrears." The association replied: "According to the recommendation of UNRRA consultant Todd for the dike restoration work funds in the Communist-controlled area, payments were made according to the work performance. 6 billion yuan was allocated to the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in June and July of last year for transfer. According to the report of consultant Todd's inspection of the dike restoration situation in the Communist-controlled area on August 1 last year, it is believed that the border government has received sufficient assistance, and the paid food is sufficient to pay for the costs of the completed project. The great letter said, obviously untrue. As for the teaching relief fee for riverbed residents, the Executive Yuan has approved a huge amount of funds, which will be handled by the Executive Relief Executive."

(3) Regarding what Mr. Dong said, "The distribution of the 66 billion yuan for the blockage and restoration project should be allocated fairly and reasonably according to the length of the dike line and the size of the project. The current allocation amounts stipulated by the Blockage and Restoration Bureau are obviously unfair, and we cannot agree." The association replied: "It should be based on how to use the blockage and restoration funds in accordance with the established plan, and the good and bad conditions of the dike are the basis for weighing the urgency of the project. There is no basis for the provision that the Communist-controlled area should account for 60%, and there is no record of this item in the agreement of May 18 last year."

Editorial

### Please Implement the Agreement on Dalian Between China and the Soviet Union

The United States government, on the 3rd, simultaneously instructed its embassies in China and the Soviet Union to inform the Chinese and Soviet governments, requesting that China and the Soviet Union implement the agreement on Dalian in the Sino-Soviet Treaty, so that Dalian can return to normal under the administration of the Chinese government. The wording of this note is very mild and tactful, and solemnly declares: "The United States government recognizes that this issue should be resolved through direct negotiations between China and the Soviet Union, but for the general interests of the United States, the United States must consider itself responsible for raising this issue with the two governments directly concerned." It is obvious that this action by the United States does not constitute interference in the Dalian issue, and will not cause diplomatic problems between China, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Its sole motive is to hope that Dalian will return to normal as soon as possible, which should be welcomed by the people of China and the Soviet Union.

Regarding the issue of receiving Dalian, General Zhao Gongwu, the representative of our country, had already conducted negotiations with the Soviet side. The Associated Press also once reported that three agreements had been reached: (1) After Dalian is taken over by the National Army, it will be opened as a free port, open to trade and shipping of all countries; (2) The Soviet Union will enjoy the privilege of renting wharves and warehouses; (3) The administrative power of Dalian belongs to the Chinese government. However, this widely rumored story has never become a reality. On the contrary, not long after, the incident of the Soviet military authorities in Dalian refusing to allow American reporters to land occurred. Although American public opinion attached great importance to this, the United States State Department, in order to cherish the friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, always adopted a "compromising" attitude, unwilling to expand this incident, and even claimed that the Soviet Union's actions were "legal actions," only expressing a wish: "According to the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 1945, Dalian is a free commercial port and should be under Chinese administration; however, the Chinese and Soviet governments have not yet agreed on the handover method, so Dalian is still under Soviet military control. The United States government hopes that they can agree on the handover method as soon as possible, but still recognizes that this matter should be resolved through direct negotiations between China and the Soviet Union." Therefore, the fact that the Dalian incident did not cause a major international political storm must be attributed to the United States' enlightened and prudent attitude.

Putting aside all theories, let us consider it from a legal point of view. Dalian should have been taken over by China long ago and opened as a free port, open to trade and shipping of all countries. There is really no reason why this matter has not been resolved. According to a report by American journalist Newton, the Soviet Union has another interpretation of Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance regarding the Dalian Agreement: "During the war, Dalian is not included in the scope of the military base regulations stipulated in the Lushun Agreement of August 14, 1945, and is only subject to the military control set by the region during the war against Japan," believing that China and the Soviet Union are still at war with Japan and will not end until the peace treaty with Japan is signed. Therefore, the Soviet Union intends to retain complete control over Dalian and wants to retain troops in Dalian until the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The Soviet Union's view of the treaty is a misunderstanding, and an unwarranted misunderstanding. This is very obvious.

First, there is no treaty basis for the Soviet Union to station troops in Dalian. It was only an agreement reached between the commanders of the Chinese and Soviet armies during the war, allowing the Soviet Union to use Dalian as a base for the war against Japan. Now the war against Japan has ended a long time ago, and it has been almost a year and a half. The Soviet army no longer needs to use Dalian as a base, and there is no need to stay in Dalian.

Second, the agreement on Dalian also stipulates the phrase "during the war against Japan." Although the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been signed, it cannot be considered "during the war against Japan." According to international law, after Japan surrendered, the "period of war against Japan" has passed, which is completely different from "wartime conditions." Moreover, the United States has also announced that the "wartime state" has ended since the beginning of this year!

Third, the Soviet government informed the Chinese government on May 23 last year that all Soviet troops had withdrawn from Northeast China. The Soviet government believes that the war against Japan has ended, which can be clearly proved in this note. What reason does the Soviet Union have to refuse to hand over Dalian to the Chinese government?

In short, China and the Soviet Union are the two major stabilizing forces in the Far East. Whether for the sake of their own interests or for the sake of the future of the Far East and even the entire world, they should maintain friendly relations and cooperate closely. The diplomatic policy adopted by the Chinese government is also based on this unchanging keynote. When the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed the year before last, the Chinese government did not hesitate to use Lushun as a joint military base for China and the Soviet Union as the price for obtaining Soviet friendship. This is the most powerful proof. Since then, for the past year and a half, the Chinese government has恪守不渝 all treaties between China and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it has exhausted all diplomatic means in successive international conferences, always hoping that China can truly become a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, so that they can cooperate and not go their separate ways. It is unwarranted for the Soviet Union to misunderstand China. Therefore, we hope that the Soviet Union can reflect on itself, cherish the traditional friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and earnestly fulfill all treaties between China and the Soviet Union. If this can be done, not only can all outstanding issues between China and the Soviet Union be easily resolved, but also the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union can also improve accordingly. We sincerely hope that the relationship between China, the United States, and the Soviet Union will become clearer and brighter as the Dalian issue is resolved satisfactorily!

### Prospects of the American Political Situation

Since the opening of the 80th Congress of the United States on the 3rd of this month, all parties have been looking forward to President Truman's address, announcing the policies that the United States will adopt in domestic and foreign affairs in the future. This important address was personally delivered to Congress by President Truman on the 6th, and Republican members expressed satisfaction with it. As Republican Senator Vandenberg said, "President Truman's address was worded mildly and tactfully, and was unanimously approved by Republican members. The President's arguments on the relationship between the White House and Congress are also reasonable." Republican Senator Halleck also said: "The Republican Party is also willing to cooperate with President Truman to achieve a fair resolution of American problems, and believes that the Republican and Democratic parties in the House of Representatives will be able to work together harmoniously." It can be seen that President Truman's speech has received a good response in the United States. From this, it can also be expected that President Truman will not have disagreements with Congress before his term expires and cause a major political upheaval. This cannot but be said to be a gratifying phenomenon in the future of American politics.

After the Republican Party won the victory in the re-election of the United States Senate last year, everyone was worried about President Truman. After the opening of the 80th Congress, the White House and Congress would not be able to live in peace, and open and covert struggles would be inevitable. Therefore, the American political situation was likely to fluctuate at any time. Until the eve of the opening of the 80th Congress, there were indeed dangerous signs. The issue of Republican members advocating the expulsion of Democratic Senator Bilbo from the Senate for bribery was a complete mess. At the same time, as a result of the re-election of the speakers of the House of Representatives and the Senate, Vandenberg was elected as the Speaker of the Senate, and Martin was elected as the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Republican Party, which had been in the opposition for fifteen years, finally regained control of Congress. In addition, on the day that the newly appointed Speaker of the House of Representatives, Martin, was sworn in, he straightforwardly stated: "The current American system has made the United States the greatest country in history, and the American government should not tolerate those who favor the communist system." At that time, the cheers of the members were endless, and the House of Representatives was suddenly filled with anti-communism and anti-Roosevelt sentiments. How would President Truman deal with himself in this situation? Of course, this was a serious issue, especially how to word the first presidential address to be presented to the 80th Congress? This was an even more difficult problem!

However, President Truman's address was finally delivered, and it has been well received by all parties. One cannot help but admire President Truman's political wisdom. We summarize the full text and, in summary, the following items relate to foreign affairs: (1) The main interests of the United States and the Soviet Union depend on the rapid creation of world peace, so the United States and the Soviet Union should cooperate closely; (2) If the United States can continue to cooperate with other countries in a spirit of prudence and patience, it will surely create lasting world peace; (3) The United States will continue to provide economic assistance to countries affected by the war; (4) Before the hope of peace is realized, the US military cannot be reduced; (5) The United States recognizes Austria's independence and should clearly tell Germany and Japan their future destiny and boundaries; (6) It is hoped that atomic energy will only be used for peace, so that countries around the world can benefit from it; (7) The United States should maintain strong strength so that it can repel aggressive forces at any time; (8) The purpose of the United States is to seek collective security for all mankind. Regarding domestic affairs, there are also the following points: (1) The White House and Congress should cooperate with each other to pass labor laws to prevent labor unrest; (2) The new US labor law will establish the principles of negotiation and collective contracts; (3) The future of the American economy is very optimistic; (4) The government's financial budget, no matter how large the military expenditure is, must be able to achieve a balance of payments; (5) American youth should receive universal training; (6) Relief for veterans; (7) Fundraising for the Republican and Democratic parties to work together to avoid threats to national security.

Although the points mentioned by President Truman in his address do not have the far-reaching and lofty ideals of the policies adopted by the late President Roosevelt, they are still practical methods in reality. Under the current environment, President Truman can only adopt this policy to obtain the unanimous support of the Democratic and Republican parties. Post-war America is also a country where everything is waiting to be rebuilt. "Stability first" is the most urgent need for America today. It is necessary to find ways to solve all the problems facing America in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. President Truman's address finally brought temporary stability to the American political situation. Therefore, we cannot criticize President Truman's address with tinted glasses, nor can we immediately say that American politics is regressing. President Truman's success or failure depends on whether he can complete his mission under the joint support of the Democratic and Republican parties!

### Shocking Blood Case in Guhu Baimao Port: 16 Lives on the Ship Were Brutally Murdered; After Ten Days of Searching, the Criminals Have All Been Arrested

[Pinghu News from Our Newspaper] Following the major cases of Jiapu car robberies, Jiapu pirates, and Xincang machine crew robberies in our county, another major blood case of the entire crew and passengers of the Shanyang shift Wei Jiafa sailing ship being brutally murdered has occurred. This sailing ship usually operates between Pinghu and Shanyang, carrying passengers and goods, and travels back and forth daily, and has always been safe and sound. Unexpectedly, on December 25th of last year, it carried rice wine and white rice, as well as ten passengers, and after leaving Pinghu, it did not return to Pinghu on the same day, and there was no news on the 26th. People began to suspect and searched everywhere, but to no avail. It was not until the 27th that the Lu Guiyou machine crew, which was traveling between Xincang, discovered the ship in the Baimao Port. When they approached to investigate, there was no one on the ship. They only saw messy clothes and blood stains in the cabin, which aroused suspicion. They wanted to tow it back to Pinghu, but they found three corpses hanging in the river at the end of the rope. They had no choice but to return to Pinghu with the corpses and the ship. The shipowner, Wei Aqi, was shocked and almost fainted when he heard the news. He identified the corpse as a crew member on the ship and immediately reported it to the security authorities, requesting that the case be investigated and solved. Since the occurrence of the case, the county police bureau has dispatched police officers overnight to investigate the scene of the incident and hired net boats to salvage the corpses. On the 28th, four corpses were salvaged, including three crew members and one young passenger. On the 29th, it was discovered that Chen Qichang, the squad leader of the East Lake Town National Guard, had also been killed. As such, the incident shocked the county far and wide. Unexpectedly, on the 30th, a nameless male corpse was found next to the Mopan Beach River, six miles away from the scene of the Shanyang shift incident. This further increased the mystery of the case. All parties speculated that another blood case had occurred, or that the thugs were creating a false alarm. However, after observing the thugs' meticulous planning and calmness, the atmosphere of terror became even more frightening. In total, there were six crew members and ten passengers who were killed in the entire case. Seven bodies have been found, and the remaining nine are believed to have been killed. The cries at the autopsy site shook the sky, and the scene was extremely tragic. The county government convened an emergency security meeting and stepped up the search for the bandits. After successive arrests of seven suspects, the entire case was solved by the county police bureau on the 4th of this month. The main ringleader, Yin Wenkui, was transferred to the bureau overnight and has confessed without denial. These bandits came from the Taihu Lake area. After the incident, they planned to escape in the original direction. After receiving the report, the police bureau rushed to pursue them overnight and intercepted a bandit ship at the junction of Pingjia and Song. There were four bandits from other provinces on board, and they were all captured in one fell swoop. According to the investigation and statement issued by the Five Towns National Guard of the urban area, Gu Wenkui was also involved in the yellow bean robbery near Yinjiazhai two weeks ago and another blood case in addition to the Shanyang blood case.

### Changshu Tax Collection Officials Repeatedly Murdered; Two Killed, One Escaped; Fierce Battle During the Suppression of Pirates at Xiaojin Mountain

[Changshu News from Our Newspaper] Fei Kangkang, the Baoding (local security chief) of the sixth Bao (neighborhood) of Meili Zhenmen Township, who also served as a tax collection official, was suddenly invaded by more than ten bandits holding short guns on the morning of the 4th. Fei was tied up on the spot and brutally shot at the Luxiang Bridge Pier. The body has been collected by his family members and reported to the county government for arrest of the murderers. Also, the home of Xue Xiaofa, a tax collection official in Qiujiaba, Tangqiao Township in this area, was suddenly invaded by more than ten bandits before dawn on the 4th, attempting to kill Xue. Fortunately, Xue was alert and escaped from the back door. When the bandits saw that Xue was not there, they robbed property and left with a roar. Also, police chief Hu Lanteng and police officer Li Xiankui were ordered to accompany the public servants to Jiangxiang Township outside the South Gate to collect rent. They were ordered not to move by six or seven plainclothes people holding guns, and the guns carried by Hu and Li were confiscated and taken away. After investigation by the county government, police officer Li Xiankui has returned to the team with his gun, but 36 rounds of ammunition are missing.

However, Gao was still in the urban area on the evening of the 3rd, so it is feared that this is a false rumor, and no corpse was found near Bridge No. 3 on Yangfu Road. The county authorities have sent people to investigate the situation to clarify the truth.

[Songjiang News from Our Newspaper] Outside Jinshan Zui, a coastal area of this county, pirates often plunder merchant ships, so boatmen traveling there are all vigilant. One day at noon, Li, the squad leader of the Shanyang Security Detachment stationed there, arrested Chen Abao, a man suspected of being involved. After questioning him, it was learned that the pirate ship was near Xiaojin Mountain, and there was a Wenzhou firewood boat that had been looted. There were twelve bandits on the pirate ship, holding a total of eight or nine rifles and Type 38 Mauser pistols, and the ammunition was also quite abundant. The arrested Chen Abao, according to reports from passengers crossing the sea, is said to be the deputy leader of the pirates. The Caojing District Office immediately transferred the East Gate and other security teams and the stationed security detachment, and the police chief and police officers took sea boats to encircle and suppress them. Because the pirates opened fire to resist, the sound of gunfire was tight for a time, as if facing a major enemy. The pirates fled into the misty sea due to the disparity in strength. As a result, a Wenzhou firewood boat that had been hijacked and two crew members were intercepted. More than 200 dan of firewood were loaded on the boat. However, three other crew members on the boat were still taken away by the pirates. The arrested Chen Abao has been transferred to the County Military Law Office for interrogation.

### Suzhou Commercial Loan: More Twists and Turns

[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou on the 7th] All parties are eagerly requesting a commercial loan in Suzhou. There were some signs of it before, and it was expected that the commercial economy could be revived. However, recently, the national banks in this city suddenly stated that this loan had nothing to do with the mandatory rules set by the banking industry and that it would easily create opportunities for merchants to speculate and hoard goods, so they would not approve the loan. After the news was revealed, the Suzhou business community was panic-stricken. They were worried that the Lunar New Year was approaching, and the disappointment of the loan would inevitably lead to a collapse. The county chamber of commerce was deeply concerned about this. So, on the 7th, it urgently telegraphed the Joint Office of Four Banks, requesting relief.

### Discord Arises During the Newlyweds' Homecoming; Gunfire Display Reported as Robbery; Villagers Showing Off, a Bloody and Humorous Drama

[News from Our Newspaper in Wuxing] Shao Shuqing, a resident of Shaojiawan, Huanzhu Township, in this county, hired a matchmaker to marry Gu Yunzhen (19 years old this year), the daughter of Gu Hongsheng, a farmer in Heshangdian, Xinshu Township. On the morning of January 3rd, a sedan was prepared from the groom's home to welcome her. After the wedding on the same day, according to the old custom, the groom and bride went to the bride's home on the same afternoon for the homecoming. On that day, the matchmaker, the wedding assistant, and relatives Wu Zhengxian, Yang Xizhi, Ye Gensen, Yan Shougen, and Shao Rongqing, and five others (each carrying a rifle), rode on a boat to the bride's house as guests. After seeing the bride's parents, they were about to eat the homecoming banquet. However, they were dissatisfied because the dishes were simple and inferior. After eating, the groom and others returned to the groom's home. Just as they were leaving the gate, there was a turtle painted on the wall, with the names of the groom and his two younger brothers written next to it. Wu Zhengxian and others, the escorting people, questioned the bride's father. They disagreed and started scolding each other. They escorted the bride onto the boat and started negotiations with the groom's family. The surrounding villagers gathered more and more. Seeing that the situation was not good, the escorting people got off the boat and left the shore. They took out the pre-hidden rifles and fired several shots to scare the villagers. Suddenly, the order was disrupted. People started beating gongs and shouting that there were thieves. Ye Gensen, one of the escorting people, was unable to board the boat in time and was still on the shore. Knowing that he was alone and weak, and fearing that he would be caught, he pulled out a pistol and fired a warning shot. One bullet hit Zhu Bingfa's hand, and blood gushed out. All the villagers believed that it was rare for the groom to dare to kill someone with a gun during the homecoming, so they were all outraged. They seized Ye Gensen, tied him up along with the pistol, and sent him to the township office for disposal. The boat carrying the groom feared that the villagers would chase them, so they fired shots all the way, firing more than sixty shots in total. The East Gate Water Police Team heard the sound and immediately led the police team to investigate. The villagers told them that robbers had robbed them and that the bandit ship had returned to Shaojiawan. Chen, the police captain, immediately joined the County Security Police Second Detachment to the village to assist in the arrest. They captured Wu Zhengxian and others, the escorting people, and the groom and bride, and ten others at the same time. They also searched the groom's house and found four rifles, one pistol, and eighty rounds of ammunition. They were all taken to the bureau for interrogation. The injured Zhu Bingfa was sent to the Gospel Hospital for treatment by the bureau. Onlookers lined the streets. The bride looked dejected. After questioning by the Water Police Headquarters, the bride was released on bail, and the others were transferred to the Second District Commissioner's Office for legal action.

### Different Wedding Customs: Team Members Recklessly Kill People

In the afternoon, they came by boat to pick up the bride. According to the village customs, the wedding attendees threw mud from the rice fields at the groom's house to play a joke, called "throwing fa." As the boat was about to dock, the audience on the shore gathered and mud continued to fly. Four soldiers from the Yujiahui Self-Defense Force accompanied the wedding party from the groom's house. Since the customs were different, they misunderstood the situation and fired a warning shot. Zhou Chenglong was shot on the spot, and the bullet penetrated the back of his head, killing him instantly. Seeing the disaster, the crowd detained the four soldiers from the Self-Defense Force who caused the trouble and handed them over to the county government for legal action.

Quack Doctor Diagnoses Illness; Two Needles Cause Death

[Report from our Jiaxing Correspondent] Lu Aizhen, a shocking case in Shimen, Chongde, was 15 years old. Due to poverty, she worked as a servant in the home of Xi Jiahui in Yangjiaqiao, South Gate, Jiaxing. Her mother also worked as a servant in the Ma family nearby. On the night of the 4th, Aizhen's nose and mouth bled. On the afternoon of the 5th, her mother accompanied her to Liu Futang's acupuncture and traumatology clinic on Zhongjie, North Gate, for treatment. Liu said that four needles were needed to cure the disease and charged 60,000 yuan. Aizhen's mother reluctantly agreed. Liu first gave an injection in her left arm, and then another injection in her right arm (intravenous injection). After more than ten minutes, the patient's face turned white and she fell down. Liu falsely claimed that this was a normal reaction after the injection and took the opportunity to escape. Liu's daughter-in-law also disappeared. Aizhen soon died. Her mother reported it to the police, who reported it to the local court's procuratorate to send someone for inspection. However, because the deceased still had a slight warmth in her heart at the time, a diagnosis could not be made. A search of Liu's medicine bottles could not determine what medicine caused the patient's death. An autopsy is needed to clarify the cause. Liu's whereabouts are unknown after being pursued by the police (according to Liu, he was originally a quack doctor and also caused a death case for extracting teeth before the Anti-Japanese War). The incident caused a sensation in the city, and the Zhongjie area was crowded with people vying to inquire about the situation.

The New Year's Day celebration ceremony was presided over by Xia Wei, commander of the Eighth Pacification Area. At 12:00 noon, the city government hosted guests. The event was lively and considered a grand occasion. In the evening, the Xiasheng Drama School, which had recently arrived in Bengbu from Xuzhou, performed Peking Opera at the Victoria Theater on Huachang Street as entertainment for guests from all walks of life. After taking office, the new mayor unveiled four policy guidelines for this year: (1) stabilize social order, (2) strengthen municipal construction, (3) lay the foundation for constitutional government, and (4) develop the city's industry and commerce. If he can truly follow these established standards and implement them step by step, it is believed that Bengbu City will definitely have new and considerable achievements.

The slogan of building a new Bengbu has long been overflowing in the ears of citizens. There has been some performance during the preparation for the establishment of the city. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, everyone places great expectations on the newly established municipal government, hoping to establish some achievements with a new style for everyone to see.

Talking About the Past
The City is Messy, Dirty, and Foul

Speaking of the construction of Bengbu during the preparation for the establishment of the municipality, it is nothing more than engineering construction and public utilities, but they have not been fully demonstrated due to the limitations of business funding. Mayor Li told our reporter that Bengbu City was devastated by the enemy and puppets during the eight years of its fall. At the beginning of the recovery, the city was in a state of mess, dirt, stench, and destruction. The roads have been in disrepair for a long time and have no system to speak of, and most of them have not been paved. In particular, the width is not enough, resulting in traffic jams. There are no formal docks built on both sides of the Huai River, and it is inconvenient to transport goods up and down. Citizens arbitrarily build in the streets, and the city appearance is very untidy. There is no water supply system, and general drinking water is taken from shallow wells and rivers. The former tastes bitter, and the latter is turbid, both of which damage the health of citizens. There is also no formal drainage system. The old drainage ditches are not dredged, and there are still a few places where water flows through the streets, with a stench, which is extremely unsanitary. The power plant is insufficient due to the old machines, and only one-fifth of the city can get lights, with most of the city in darkness. Other public facilities such as vegetable markets are missing. From this, it can be seen that the city's engineering construction and public utilities have no foundation at all. Since the establishment of the Engineering Bureau, it has started to repair and rebuild, and formulated a plan based on the actual situation, and earnestly promoted it, hoping to gradually complete the construction of the new Bengbu City.

Repairing Roads
And Dredging Sewers

Mayor Li continued: Most of the existing roads in the city have been destroyed for a long time, or have not been paved. It is difficult to walk in rainy and muddy weather, and transportation is very inconvenient. In the past year, on the one hand, the old roads were selected for renovation and repair, a total of 800 meters of gravel pavement on Damalu, 890 meters of asphalt pavement on Ermalu, 900 meters of cinder pavement on Zhongrong Street, 750 meters of gravel pavement on Gongyuan Road, 240 meters of gravel pavement on Guofu Road, 550 meters of flagstone pavement on Taigu Road were completed, and 4,000 meters of the Banghuai Road in the suburbs, 2,200 meters of Lantian Road, and 800 meters of Banglin Road were repaired, with a total of 12,130 meters of urban roads renovated. On the one hand, new urban roads were opened up, completing 2,010 meters of cinder pavement on Zhongzheng Road (ie Victory Road), filling 2,961 cubic meters of earth, 930 meters of Latitude 4 Road, filling 4,256 cubic meters of earth, 120 meters of Zhongshan Road, filling 9,166 cubic meters of earth, 237 meters of the military station branch line, and 245 meters of Minsheng Road, with a total of 3,542 meters of new urban roads opened up. All streets without ditches, or newly opened roads, must add sewers, so a plan for dredging and building sewers was specifically formulated. It was started in October last year with work relief. By the end of the year, a total of 1,640 meters of old sewers were dredged, 2,000 tons of sludge were transported out, and 780 meters of new sewers were built.

Reinforcing the Huai Dike
Handling Flood Prevention and Drainage

Regarding the reinforcement of the Huai Dike in the city and the handling of flood prevention and drainage, Mayor Li also made a report, generally saying that the Bengbu city along the Huai area originally built a dike, in recent years the yellow water was a disaster, the dike body was mostly washed away, after the recovery, that is, to start reinforcement, the top of the dike is specified to be three meters wide, the outer slope is one to two, the inner slope is one to three, and the bottom of the dike is added one to five, on February 23 last year, work began, completing 5,300 meters of the Dong'an Dike, 4,256 cubic meters of earth, and 9,000 meters of the Huaibei Dike, 3,900 cubic meters of earth.

Last summer, the Yellow Flood Eastward, the Huai River surged, in mid-August, the highest water level reached 20.29 meters, breaking the highest record of previous years, the city was greatly threatened, in order to prevent the worst, a flood prevention brigade was established to rescue the dangerous embankment, lasting for three months, fortunately avoiding the collapse. At the same time, in order to prevent external water from backflowing into the city, gates were built and temporarily blocked at the sewer outlets in Laodajie, Xinchuantang, and Dawangmiao. However, due to the continuous rain, the low-lying areas of the roads in the West City area were deeply flooded. Pumping vehicles were set up and fire equipment was mobilized day and night to drain the water and maintain traffic in the city.

Renovating the Park
Effectively Reorganizing the Power Plant

Mayor Li also mentioned the construction and renovation of Zhongshan Park and the expansion of the power plant. After the victory, the population has increased sharply. In order to supply citizens with tourism, the filth in Zhongshan Park was first cleared, and then the roads in the park were repaired, flowers and trees were planted, the gates, walls, and pavilions were renovated, the fountain pool was repaired, the public sports field was rebuilt, and a public reading room was set up. In order to commemorate the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, a Victory Monument was built in the park, with both the upper and lower sides being carefully considered, with brick railings of 176 meters and flower walls of 182 meters, and a staircase was added. The completion ceremony was held on Double Ten Day last year.

During the enemy-puppet period, most of the original intact machines in the power plant were transported away, leaving only a part of the old machines to barely generate electricity. However, due to the old machines, the coal consumption was very large, so the plant was deeply in debt, and there was often a power outage. After the victory, in order to maintain the power supply, on the one hand, the Bengbu City Power Plant Reorganization Committee was organized, and relevant people in the city were hired as members of the committee, in order to gather the wisdom and efforts of the people and maintain it together, and to repair the internal machines to increase power. On the other hand, a new plant was planned to be built. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was allocated a complete set of 500-kilowatt steam turbine generator and boiler accessories. This new machine was transported to Bengbu from Shanghai in mid-November last year and has been completely installed. It is scheduled to be powered on during the old Lunar New Year Festival. (New Year's Day)

### The Female Traitor is Insatiable; She Remains in Jail After Serving Her Sentence

[Report from our Suzhou, 7th] Cao Huijun, a female traitor from Wuxi, is a well-known socialite in Xiyi. She was initially sentenced to seven years for treason by the Suzhou High Court. Cao appealed and the sentence was changed to one year and three months upon review. Unexpectedly, the traitor still expressed dissatisfaction and appealed to the Supreme Court for review, which is still pending. However, now that the one year and three month sentence has expired, Cao submitted a petition to the Suzhou High Court requesting release. The criminal court brought Cao to the court on the 7th and informed her that the Supreme Court had not yet made a ruling, so although the sentence had expired, she could not be released according to law and was ordered to be returned to custody. Cao deeply regretted not knowing self-sufficiency after hearing the notice and returned to prison in frustration. This is truly a humorous incident in punishing traitors.

### Suppressing Jewish Terrorist Activities: Britain Prepares to Take Stern Measures; Cairo Garrison Transferred to Palestine; British Government to Formulate Plan for Partitioning Palestine into Arab and Jewish Zones

[United Press London, 6th] British High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Alan Cunningham, today conferred with Prime Minister Attlee on stern measures to curb Jewish underground sabotage in the region. Well-informed sources say that once Cunningham returns to Palestine within a week or ten days, these new measures will be implemented.

[Reuters London, 6th] The British Cabinet is scheduled to meet on Thursday to decide on actions to be taken in Palestine. It is reported that the government's plan has two main goals: one is to take strong military measures against Jewish terrorists, and the other is to divide Palestine into two states, Arab and Jewish. Military measures include the implementation of martial law and the arrest of members and suspects of the Irgun and Stern Gang, two illegal terrorist groups.

[United Press London, 6th] British desert troops today departed from Egypt for Palestine, while British troops await cabinet approval to launch an offensive against Jewish extremists. Government officials say that if authorized by the cabinet, this offensive will be the largest in modern Palestinian history, and the Jewish underground forces can be wiped out in one fell swoop. Reinforcements are being sent to Palestine via road and rail, reinforcing the 100,000 British troops already stationed there. The Palestinian plan was formulated at a meeting last week, attended by British High Commissioner for Palestine Cunningham, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Montgomery, Prime Minister Attlee, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and Colonial Secretary Jones. There was unanimous agreement at repeated meetings on the need to restore order in Palestine. If Britain wants to eliminate Jewish extremists before the London Round Table Conference on the 21st of this month, it must act quickly.

### US Republican and Democratic Parties Express Willingness to Cooperate; All Parties Impressed with the President's Message

[Agence France-Presse, 6th] Regarding President Truman's message to the 80th Congress, Senator Vandenberg of the Republican Party commented that the wording of President Truman's message was moderate and gentle, and was unanimously approved by Republican members. His arguments on the relationship between the White House and Congress were also reasonable. However, after Republican members thoroughly studied the President's plan, they had to express disagreement with some of the recommendations on labor and financial issues. In essence, Republicans agree with Truman's request to grant private enterprises great freedom to develop the American economy, and his request that the national budget should be balanced. However, they are very cold to other financial proposals.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Regarding President Truman's speech to the new Congress, Republican House Leader Halleck commented: The Republican Party is also willing to cooperate with President Truman to achieve a fair resolution of American issues. I believe that the Republican and Democratic parties will be able to work together harmoniously in the House. In addition, Democratic Congressman Cox sent a letter to the new Speaker Martin, assuring him that the Democratic Party would cooperate with the Republican Party. The House adjourned at 7:15 PM.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] The section on labor issues in President Truman's message was endorsed by William Green, President of the American Federation of Labor. It is said that the President's proposal to establish an arbitration committee and not to pass strike prohibition laws is commendable. The Executive Committee of the AFL will review this issue at a meeting at the end of the month.

### Republican Party Proposes Limiting Presidential Terms

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Republican Senator Ball introduced the first labor bill of the day to the Senate this afternoon, based on the amended Case Bill. The Case Bill had been passed by the previous Congress but was vetoed by Truman. It is reported that Ball is still drafting other legislation that would make work stoppages that affect entire industries illegal. In the House, several members have proposed legislative amendments to the US Constitution, one of which is a proposal by Judiciary Committee Chairman Weichel to limit the president's term to a maximum of two consecutive terms of four years each. The second, proposed by Republican Congressman Canfield, suggests changing the four-year election system for president and vice president to a six-year election, but without the possibility of reelection after a full term. The third, also proposed by Republican Congressman Lea, suggests extending the term of House members from two to four years. The above amendments must first be passed by the Senate and House of Representatives and then ratified by two-thirds of the forty-eight states before they can be implemented.

### Guam and the Mariana Islands Should Be Incorporated into US Territory

[United Press Washington, 6th] Republican Congressman Grant today introduced a bill proposing that Guam be incorporated into the US mainland and that the formerly Japanese Mariana Islands Trust Territory be managed by the US Development Committee. The bill stipulates that the US President appoint a governor for Guam, and that an island council be established with the power to override the governor's veto. All island residents are granted citizenship. The US Secretary of the Interior shall manage the fisheries of the Mariana Islands and shall not grant fishing privileges to any party.

### Security Council Met Yesterday to Discuss the Trieste Port Issue

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] US Secretary of State Byrnes recently commented on the resignation request of Baruch, representative to the Atomic Energy Commission, and praised his brave and consistent spirit in proposing the control of atomic energy plan.

### Moutet Returns Home Today to Report; The Future of the Vietnamese Situation Remains Chaotic; French-Vietnamese Armistice Negotiations at a Standstill

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 7th] French Overseas Minister Moutet has completed his inspection of Vietnam and is scheduled to fly back to Paris on the 8th to report to the government.

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 6th] French Overseas Colonial Minister Moutet told the press here: "I believe that military action will still have to continue for some time. We certainly hope that the French-Vietnamese conflict can be stopped as soon as possible, but I do not know how much effort we can make in this regard. Although it is necessary for both parties to reach an agreement, I do not know how to reach an agreement or with whom to reach an agreement. I know that the Viet Minh leaders do not want to reach an agreement with the Zaiguo. It is also questionable whether President Ho Chi Minh is free to do so. As for President Ho Chi Minh's broadcast speech inviting me to meet with him, I think this is purely propaganda, because the Viet Minh could have contacted me when I was in Hanoi. I also do not know who we should negotiate with, because we are not necessarily required to negotiate with those who started the conflict." In short, I will report the situation I have personally witnessed to the French government.

### French Forces in Vietnam Use Paratroopers

### British-Indian Relations Not Optimistic; Indian Leaders Denounce Britain

[Reuters New Delhi, 6th] After the All-India Congress Committee passed the British government's statement of December 6, Congress President Kripalani predicted that disputes would continue to occur between Britain and India. The British government's statement explained the provisions on provincial division in its plan for Indian independence. The so-called provincial division system divides the provinces of India into three categories, and each province has the right to choose which category to join. The Congress Committee's acceptance of this statement may give the Muslim League an opportunity to join the Constituent Assembly. Kripalani said that although Britain is a socialist country, it is still a stubborn imperialist, so it will still try every possible means to obstruct India's progress.

Montgomery addressed the welcomers, saying that the Soviet military and people fought bravely during the war and suffered the greatest losses. I want to keep the British and Soviet armies in friendly contact, and I hope that this contact can create an atmosphere of mutual understanding and trust, so as to promote friendly relations between Britain and the Soviet Union. Montgomery is scheduled to visit the Soviet military academy tomorrow.

### Laski Discusses Impressions of His Visit to the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Beijing, 6th] Former British Labour Party Chairman Laski, who returned from a visit to the Soviet Union, gave a speech here today, elaborating on his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union. He said that there is obviously a desire for peace in the Soviet Union. During my time in the Soviet Union, I discovered three different trends in Moscow political circles: one advocates a compromise attitude towards the United States and Western European countries, and Stalin also agrees with this view. The second does not believe that the Soviet Union can compromise with the United States and Western European countries, and Molotov belongs to this faction. The third is led by Vice Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan, who, although he does not believe that the Soviet Union can compromise with the United States and Western Europe, is prepared to cooperate with these countries. The first trend is currently the most dominant.

### Philippines Plans to Send More Diplomatic Representatives

The plan to establish a consulate in Xiamen has already been announced. Currently, the countries with delegations stationed in the Philippines are China, the United States, Britain, France, and Italy. There are ten countries with consulates in Manila, namely the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, Siam, Switzerland, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Panama, and Lebanon.

### Full text of President Truman's address at the joint session of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives

[Washington, DC, American News Service, 5th] President Truman delivered his farewell address to the new Congress today. The speech, which was 6,000 words long, reviewed the current state of the United States. He stated that if the United States wants to fulfill its responsibilities to the world, "We should make the United States sound in all aspects of its economy, society, and politics." He continued, "If we uphold and strengthen our original ideals, if we share the joys and sufferings of the war-torn people of the world, then the beliefs of our people in democracy and freedom will be spread far and wide, and free people everywhere will join us in dedicating ourselves to this ideal."

In the sections discussing foreign affairs, atomic energy, world trade, and military policy, President Truman stated:

Foreign Affairs

Progress in achieving our domestic goals is closely related to our actions in foreign affairs. What I said about maintaining a sound and prosperous economy and improving the welfare of our people has great significance because the United States is in a position of world leadership. What we do and fail to do at home will not only affect ourselves but will also affect the millions of people in the world. If we are to fulfill our responsibilities to our people and to the people of other countries, we should make the United States an economically, socially, and politically sound nation. Only in this way can we help other countries achieve the elements of peace: political stability, economic progress, and social advancement.

Peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Finland, and Hungary have now been drafted. These treaties will be signed in Paris next month and then sent to the Senate for ratification. This government is not completely satisfied with these treaties. Although these treaties are not without flaws, I believe they represent the best agreement we could hope to achieve among the major wartime allies. Further disputes and delays would seriously jeopardize the political security of the countries concerned.

During the long years of discussing these treaties, we have made it clear to all countries that the United States will not agree to seek solutions at the cost of abandoning certain principles that we consider essential for lasting peace. Similarly, we have made it clear that we will not retreat into isolation. We will adopt the same policies in the upcoming Moscow talks on the German and Austrian peace treaties and in future conferences on the Japanese peace treaty.

The reason for the delay in concluding peace treaties is partly due to the difficulty of reaching agreement with the Soviet Union on the terms of the treaties. Regardless of any differences between the United States and the Soviet Union, such differences should not be allowed to obstruct the fact that the primary interests of both countries depend on the early establishment of peace, and only in a peaceful environment can the people of all countries return to the important work of production and reconstruction as free men and women. Our greatest concern should be to promote collective security, not to enhance individual security.

Policy toward the Soviet Union

Our policy toward the Soviet Union is based on the same principles that determine our policy toward all countries. We seek only to uphold the principles of international justice enshrined in the United Nations Charter.

We must now pursue peaceful solutions. The occupying powers should recognize Austria's independence and withdraw their troops. Germans and Japanese must not be left in doubt about their future. They must understand their borders, their resources, and the reparations they must pay. We do not want to manage their internal affairs, but we can ensure that these countries will not rearm.

International Relief

The United States has fulfilled a proud responsibility in caring for the people impoverished by the war and assisting countries in restoring their national economies. Since the end of the war, we have shipped more supplies to the hungry people of the world than all other countries combined.

However, I do not feel that the United States has fulfilled its responsibility regarding the acceptance of refugees. Since May 1946, only about 5,000 refugees have entered this country. In fact, various administrative agencies are now doing their best to provide relief within the limits of the law and quotas. Congress needs to take action with new legislation to contribute to this righteous cause. I strongly urge Congress to pay attention to this global problem and find a way for us to fulfill our responsibility to these many homeless refugees.

International Trade

World economic cooperation is a fundamental element of world political cooperation. We have made a good start on economic cooperation through the International Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Export-Import Bank. We must now take other steps to rebuild world trade, and we should continue our efforts to ensure that the international trade system is not restricted by various obstacles. The United States has led the effort to place atomic energy under effective international control. We do not want a monopoly for ourselves or any group of countries. We seek only to have sufficient guarantees that no country can use this power (atomic energy) for military purposes. If governments do not agree on a method of international control of atomic energy, then the shadow of fear will obscure the bright future of the peaceful uses of atomic energy.

Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the commission established under this law has full jurisdiction over our domestic atomic energy enterprises. The commission's plans will, of course, be carried out in close cooperation with military agencies in accordance with the wishes of Congress, but I sincerely hope that the military importance of atomic energy will gradually diminish. We expect the commission to develop atomic energy for industrial, scientific, and medical research. Our hopes are placed on the effective development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy: this new power can ultimately become the well-being of all countries.

Military Policy

In 1946, the Army and Navy completed the demobilization of their wartime forces. They are now maintaining the forces necessary for our national defense and to fulfill our international obligations.

In the world we live in today, the strength of peace-loving nations remains the greatest deterrent to aggression. When nations with major responsibilities neglect to maintain the means to fulfill their responsibilities, the stability of the world is undermined.

In this era, unpredictable attacks can come with unprecedented speed. We want to maintain strength sufficient to defeat any such attack and thereby prevent it. As we gradually move toward a more rational world order, the need for large armies will also decrease. However, the stabilizing force of American military strength should not be weakened until our hopes are fully realized. When a collective security system under the United Nations has been established, we will be willing to join in collective disarmament. However, unless such a system has been realized, we should never again allow our strength to be weakened, lest we invite attack.

To this end, we must have well-equipped and well-trained armed forces, and we should be able to quickly mobilize our manpower and resources as needed for national defense.

By July 1, 1947, the Army will be reduced to a total of 1.07 million officers and enlisted personnel. Half of them will be tasked with occupation duties, and the majority of the remainder will be stationed at home to support the overseas occupation forces.

The Navy is currently supporting the occupation forces in Europe and the Far East. Its main mission—to support our national interests when necessary—remains unchanged. During the 1948 fiscal year, the Navy (including the Marine Corps) will have 571,000 officers and enlisted personnel.

Even at this reduced level, we face many serious difficulties in maintaining our military. The occupation forces are barely sufficient to fulfill the duties required by our foreign policy. Our domestic forces have been reduced to the point where they cannot be reduced further. We would very much like the Army and Navy to be composed entirely of long-term volunteer soldiers, but although our military has been reduced, it is still difficult for voluntary enlistments to meet the Army's minimum requirements.

The Department of the Army has advised me that it is still difficult to predict whether the strength of an all-volunteer army can be maintained at the current level. This situation will become clear in a few weeks, when the results of the volunteer recruitment campaign will be announced. The Department of the Army will make recommendations regarding the need to extend the Selective Service Act so that Congress can take action before the current regulations expire on March 31. Maintaining the strength needed for our national security is the responsibility of Congress.

Developing a trained citizen reserve force is also essential for our national security. The best way to accomplish this task is through universal training. I have appointed a Universal Training Advisory Committee to study various plans to develop a training program, and I hope that the committee's recommendations will assist Congress and me in making decisions on this issue. The cost of this military construction is substantial. There is now a definite path along which we can reduce our expenses while ensuring our national security, and that is to establish a single Department of Defense. In the near future, I will exchange views with Congress on the issue of establishing a single Department of Defense.

National security includes not only the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Its scope is much broader. National security will depend on a sound economy of prices and wages, on prosperous agriculture, on satisfied and highly productive workers, on competitive private investment, on sustained industrial harmony and production, on the freedoms of the people and the liberties of the person—on everything that shapes the moral and spiritual strength of the people.

However, in addition to achieving national security, we have a higher and more important responsibility. Our goal is the collective security of all mankind. If we can work in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect, we will be able to fulfill this sacred obligation.

The spirit of the American people can determine the course of world history. If we uphold and strengthen the ideals we hold, if we share our blessings with the war-torn people of the world, then our citizens' beliefs in freedom and democracy will spread throughout the globe, and free people everywhere will work with us for these ideals.

Let us work together on this task with will and patience. May God strengthen our faith. May she grant us the wisdom to lead the nations of the world on the path to lasting peace.

Domestic Issues

Today I would also like to report to you on the domestic situation and, in accordance with the words of the Constitution, propose the measures I consider necessary and urgent.

I also come to welcome you into office and discuss with you how we should fulfill our obligations to the American people for the next two years.

The power to shape our country's future lies in your hands and in mine.

If we can find the right way to deal with every problem this year and next, if we have the courage and determination to take that path regardless of all difficulties, then we will achieve unprecedented happiness for our people in history. If we continue to cooperate with the nations of the world with enthusiasm, patience, and intelligence, then, as long as our neighbors also have the will to peace, we will be able to complete a world with lasting peace.

But if we are to achieve these goals, then the Congress and the President must cooperate with each other for the next two years. It is not an unusual thing in our history for the majority party in Congress and the party to which the President belongs to be in opposing positions. I am the twentieth President of the United States in my term, and my party holds a minority in both houses of Congress.

I am well aware that Congress and the President may have honest differences of opinion on some issues. However, such differences did not cause significant disagreements in the conduct of the war, and partisan differences did not cause serious disagreements in international relations during and after the war.

We may have disagreed on some domestic issues. This in itself is not a cause for concern, as it is natural in our system of government. But there are several types of disagreements, and people who disagree can still cooperate sincerely for the common good. If we disregard partisan interests and do not resolve disagreements in this spirit, then we will jeopardize the security of the country and destroy our chances for progress.

Domestic Economy

At the beginning of this year, 1947, our country's economic situation is extremely optimistic. Almost everyone has a job. Our national production of goods and services is 50 percent higher than in any year before the wartime emergency. The national income in 1946 was higher than at any other time. Our food production is greater than ever before. In the past five years, we have expanded production equipment in every area. The standard of living in the United States is now higher than ever before, and when the housing shortage can be overcome, the standard of living will be even higher.

In the past few months, we have rapidly abolished the emergency controls imposed by the federal government during the war. The remaining controls will only be retained to protect the public interest. Private enterprises must have the maximum degree of freedom to continue to expand our economy.

In my proclamation of December 31, 1946, I declared the war to be over. As a result, some temporary legislation and some powers were automatically terminated.

Two sets of temporary laws still exist: the first set consists of laws ordered by Congress to remain in effect during the "emergency" period, and the second set consists of laws that continue until the "end of the war."

I will recommend to Congress that it repeal certain statutes that continue during the "emergency period." At the same time, I will recommend that other statutes in this category be extended until the state of war is ended by treaty or legislative action. Regarding those statutes that continue, I strongly urge Congress to quickly consider each statute individually and, where appropriate, repeal such emergency legislation.

Now that almost all wartime controls have been abolished, the operation of our industrial system depends largely on the decisions of merchants, farmers, and workers. These decisions must be made with a genuine concern for the public welfare. The happiness of merchants, farmers, and workers depends on the economic welfare of the people who buy their goods.

An important source of economic danger at present is the possibility of high prices, which would make it impossible for the consuming public to buy large quantities of the goods and services produced in 1947.

We all know that the recent increase in prices has offset much of the value of the recent wage increases for our workers. Farmers have found that most of the increase in their income has been absorbed by the increase in prices. Some people in our country still have an increase in their income that exceeds the increase in prices, but most people have not received such a large increase. Those who live on fixed incomes, such as retired people who live on pensions and staff whose income is more flexible, such as teachers or other public servants, have been in difficulty.

In an effort to create a sound and balanced price organization, every group among our people has its own responsibilities. Industry must not only restrain price increases, but also reduce prices in favorable circumstances. Labor must avoid demanding unreasonable wage increases so as not to stimulate price increases. The government must do its best to encourage large-scale production, because with large-scale production, there can be good salaries, low prices, and reasonable profits.

In a few days, the President will submit to Congress an economic report and a budget message. These messages will contain many suggestions. Today I will outline five major economic policies that I believe the government should adopt in 1947. The purpose of these policies is to meet our current needs and at the same time provide for the long-term welfare of our free enterprise system:

First, promote harmony between labor and management. Second, restrict monopolies and unfair regulations; assist small businesses, promote free competition in private investment. Third, continue the aggressive program of domestic construction. Fourth, balance the budget for the next fiscal year and achieve a substantial surplus to reduce the public debt. Fifth, in post-war agriculture, ensure that farmers receive fair levels of remuneration. (To be continued tomorrow)

### City Council Lively Proceedings Third Meeting Today

[Reported by this newspaper] The City Council continued its second meeting of the second general assembly at Zhengshi Middle School at 2:20 p.m. yesterday. Councilors questioned the police, health, social welfare, and education bureaus. During the meeting, the case of garbage truck drivers of the Health Bureau using public vehicles for private gain sparked a lively discussion. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m. All written and oral inquiries were submitted in writing to the responsible officials for investigation and response. In addition, due to time constraints, the bureau chiefs of the four bureaus were unable to answer all inquiries orally yesterday, and the unanswered inquiries will be continued at the third meeting this afternoon. During today's general assembly, the council will also question the finance, land administration, public utilities, and engineering bureaus.

In addition, the Xindu Broadcasting Station (call sign XLST, frequency 1160), sponsored by the City Council, will broadcast the entire news of the general assembly daily during the meeting.

### The Highest Point of the General Assembly A Major Disturbance Garbage Trucks Engaging in Private Business Transporting Vegetables and Yellow Croaker The Health Bureau Chief's Unsatisfactory Response Sparks a Wave of Criticism Throughout the Venue

[Reported by this newspaper] Near the end of yesterday's general assembly, a sudden storm arose over the Health Bureau's garbage trucks engaging in private business, instantly making the atmosphere at the venue tense. Some councilors were impatient to speak, and the sound from the loudspeakers was truly earth-shattering.

The reason for the councilors' extensive discussion was that Wang Naixu raised an inquiry with the Health Bureau: "There is so much garbage piled up in the city, and the Health Bureau is not doing its best to clear it away. Instead, every morning, garbage trucks are used to load vegetables between Dapu Bridge and the fish market, transporting vegetables and yellow croaker for vendors to do business. The budget for the purchase of equipment for cleaning garbage and excrement is 120 million yuan. Using the citizens' hard-earned money to do business is truly heartbreaking." There were also photos to prove it.

Based on this, Xu Yongzuo, Jiang Pingfan, and 23 other councilors proposed an emergency motion: "Regarding the case of the Health Bureau's garbage trucks engaging in private business for personal gain, please have the general assembly appoint representatives to form an investigation team to thoroughly investigate." Councilor Jiang added that the Health Bureau's illegal profits could reach more than 30 million yuan per month. At the same time, using such dirty vehicles to transport vegetables is detrimental to hygiene. Please organize an investigation team and ask Director Zhang to report truthfully.

Then everyone discussed the matter, some supported organizing an investigation team, some suggested that Director Zhang investigate and report to the general assembly within two days, and some advocated handing it over to the Health Committee for review. The result was to ask Director Zhang to first give an explanation. Zhang Wei under attack from all sides (Photo by this newspaper)

### Zhang Wei Takes the Stage to Speak Calling it Service in Spare Time

Director Zhang calmly stepped onto the podium and said: "Speaker, gentlemen, we have already investigated a few times about garbage trucks bringing back vegetables and yellow croaker after work, and we have punished some drivers. I do not deny this fact. This kind of thing also existed in the concession era. But the drivers' salaries are meager, only 120,000 yuan per month. Many drivers have resigned or been dismissed. Some have worked for more than ten years, and we always want to treat them kindly. New drivers are not familiar with the work and often overturn when dumping garbage. In order to find a way out for the drivers and turn illegal behavior into legal behavior, we give them two or three hours of 'service in spare time' after they finish their work, lend them the trucks, use their own gasoline, and find some subsidies. But I guarantee that no one in the bureau has colluded with them. I have reported this matter to the mayor at municipal meetings several times. At the same time, I absolutely welcome the City Council to send representatives to investigate, but the drivers are so poor, please find a way to help them solve their difficulties." The mayor also followed up by stating and proving for Director Zhang that he had indeed reported it several times, but he really could not think of a reasonable solution. He had consulted Councilor Zhou Xiangsheng, but because he was too busy with public affairs, there was no result. I can prove that Director Zhang himself has absolutely no collusion, but this trend is indeed not appropriate.

### Garbage Trucks Carrying Vegetables Too Unhygienic

Obviously, the councilors did not find the director's report satisfactory. Shao Yongsheng was also very sympathetic to the drivers' meager salaries, but he did not agree that the City Council should find a way to solve the difficulties. This should be the responsibility of the bureau. On the other hand, since the director has admitted that this happened and explained the situation, it seems unnecessary to organize an investigation team.

Zhang Zhongyuan thought of a practical and serious problem, "Garbage trucks are used to transport vegetables, and we eat them every day, isn't that too unhygienic, too dangerous?" Xu Yongzuo strongly disagreed with the director's attitude of sympathizing with his subordinates, he said: The director seems to be openly allowing his subordinates to be "corrupt," then other civil servants can also be "corrupt" because their salaries are meager. The trend of "corruption" must not be rectified. Because there is no way to solve the problem, and they can be "corrupt," can they still be worthy of being Chinese citizens!

### Since Garbage Trucks Can Do Business in Spare Time Why Doesn't the Municipal Government Turn the Place into a Dance Floor at Night? Jiang Hao Raises Questions Lu Shidao Demands a Thorough Investigation

One wrong word from Director Zhang caused a major disaster, and the councilors attacked him in groups. Lu Shidao said angrily: "Local officials allow their subordinates to be 'corrupt.' Not only is Director Zhang responsible, but the mayor should also be responsible. How is this money from corruption used? Does the director get a share? Does the mayor get a share? This matter must be thoroughly investigated. Jiang Hao also expressed suspicion, he asked: "If public vehicles are used for business, then can the municipal government's houses be lent to the public at night to be used as dance floors or to sell vegetables? The municipal government often says that the concession era also had this, and foreign countries also have this. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they still say this kind of thing. This phenomenon really shouldn't exist. Otherwise, everything is good in foreign countries, why not give away the previous concessions again?"

### Zhang Wei Takes the Stage Again Explaining the Misunderstanding

At this time, Speaker Pan spoke and announced the end of the discussion, asking Director Zhang to provide further explanation. Director Zhang quickly stated, "I didn't explain clearly just now, which caused a misunderstanding. I didn't say that this kind of thing should be done. The drivers who were discovered have been fired. In desperation, I made the behavior in the dark done in broad daylight to make it legal. But this kind of behavior is indeed illegal. I believe that I have been law-abiding throughout my life, but it is difficult to make the three or four thousand cleaners and garbage collectors sound, even though I have not managed them fully. We have organized a 'Cleaning and Sanitation Management Committee' as an advisory body to seek solutions."

Four councilors: Expressions when speaking: Lu Huimin Bottom: Tong Xingbai Right: Tao Baichuan Left: Feng Youzhen

### Final Vote on Submission to Committee Review

Among the senators, some also felt that this matter should not be taken so seriously. Tao Baichuan proposed that it be handed over to the Health Committee for review before further action. The speaker also announced the same result, clarifying that review did not mean the matter would be dropped. However, Wang Naixu insisted on investigating how many such garbage trucks there were, how much income was embezzled, and how the distribution was handled.

Finally, when it became unavoidable to put it to a vote, the result was that 45 out of 118 people seconded the motion to submit it to the Health Committee for review. However, Lu Shidao insisted on forming an investigation team, while only ten votes supported submitting it to the committee for review. In the end, it was decided to submit it to the Health Committee for review, and the original proposer could also attend. The meeting time was repeatedly postponed, and at six o'clock, a heated scene finally came to an end.

### Municipal School Teachers Petition, Requesting Increased Salaries; General Assembly Discusses and Decides to Submit to Education Committee for Review

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Municipal Elementary School Principals' Association and the Municipal School Teachers and Staff Association jointly petitioned the General Assembly yesterday. The Education Committee conveners, Tong Xingbai, Ju Feicheng, and Xu Zerang, received them, and Mr. Tong reported to the General Assembly that the petitioners' main point was that their salaries were too low to maintain a living, and they requested an increase. The main method proposed was to collect a "Respect-the-Teacher Fund" from students, similar to a teacher welfare fund. Due to the significant implications, they did not have the authority to respond and could only await the General Assembly's final decision. After discussion, it was decided to submit it to the Education Committee for review.

### Market Vendors Also Come to Petition

Following the petition to the General Assembly by outdoor vegetable vendors from the 11th District the day before, yesterday, several hundred indoor vegetable vendors from the same district also arrived at the General Assembly to petition, holding red and green paper flags. They claimed that the outdoor vegetable vendors setting up stalls at the entrances and exits were obstructing the business of the indoor vegetable vendors, and they requested the Senate to uphold justice and stop it. Senator Tang Shichang received them and advised both sides to first discuss a proper solution for harmonious coexistence. Regarding the opposition from the cultural and artistic circles, I believe everyone is already aware. Now, friends in the cultural field have asked me to convey that art is also a part of culture. In Shanghai, which claims to be the national cultural center, it is unacceptable to not allow the establishment of even a single art school. Currently, general national schools lack labor and art teachers, and art teachers can provide assistance in this regard. I have several questions for the Education Bureau: (1) How much money was actually saved by abolishing an art normal school? (2) What fraction of the total education budget did the total expenditure for art teachers account for last year? (3) Will the abolition be beneficial or detrimental to national education? This is not a question of censure, but rather a request for a response.

### Next Semester Tuition Fees

Regarding the issue of tuition fees for the next semester, Huang Bingquan asked: (1) The last General Assembly resolved to impose restrictions because private school fees were too high. Now that the cost of living has increased, tuition fees will also increase. Does the Education Bureau already have regulations for tuition fees for the next semester? (2) The semester is coming to an end, and schools are charging students' parents a "retention fee," ranging from 20,000 to 40,000 [currency unit] for elementary schools. What is this money used for? Has the Education Bureau approved or agreed to this beforehand? Female Senator Lu Huiming also questioned whether there were already regulations for tuition fees for municipal and private schools for the next semester. Furthermore, Zhu Wenqi asked: The Ministry of Education ordered private schools to register. What proportion of private schools completed registration during the initial one-quarter period, and how many of the remaining three-quarters have completed the registration procedures to date? Gong Xia stated: (1) There are few schools in suburban areas, and many children are out of school. Although this was included in this year's budget, is it still possible to increase it? (2) What is the performance of adult education's public night schools? If they are not performing well, it would be better to abolish them and establish more national schools. Tao Guangchuan stated: After the salaries of municipal school teachers and staff were adjusted in December, they still felt unable to make ends meet. Today, education is touted as the top priority, and teachers have great responsibilities, but because their lives are unstable, they are switching careers, which has a significant impact. Therefore, it is hoped that salaries will be substantially increased and that teachers' salaries should not be restricted by comparison to civil servants. Wang Wei yin stated: Radio education is a major issue for social education and should be given more attention. The Senate previously resolved that education funding should not be less than 20 percent of the budget. The original budget was 6.2 billion [currency unit], but the Education Bureau's report shows that only 1.8 billion [currency unit] has been used. It is hoped that more will be used to promote education.

### Dissatisfaction with Education, Questions Arise in Succession; Dismissal of Art Normal School Seen as Bordering on Prejudice

There were also quite a few questions about the Education Bureau. Regarding the dismissal of the Municipal Art Normal School, there were two opposing opinions: Shen Ding stated: (1) The last General Assembly passed a resolution requesting the municipal government to order the Education Bureau to adjust its structure and save expenses. Yesterday, when the General Assembly opened, students from the Municipal Art Normal School braved the wind and rain to distribute leaflets in front of the gate to petition. I felt uneasy when I saw this. However, after carefully studying the matter, I felt that the Education Bureau should be held responsible for this. The reasons are as follows: (1) Dismissing the Municipal Art Normal School and merging it into the Xinlu Normal School would still allow art students to study, and there would be no increase in expenses. This is something easy to do, so why did the Education Bureau sit idly by and not do it? (2) In the Education Bureau's budget for the second half of 1946, it stated that the Art Normal School would be maintained until the end of the year. However, in the bureau's budget for this year, the Art Normal School's expenses are still included, which shows a self-contradiction and a lack of sincerity. (3) In the Art Normal School, there are only two art classes, but there are three ordinary junior high school classes. Why add affiliated classes outside of the Art Normal School? This clearly violates the Ministry of Education's regulations. The Education Bureau is clearly acting out of spite and obstructing things. Since the last General Assembly resolved to dismiss it, an advertisement has appeared in the newspaper ridiculing me for not understanding education and praising the Education Bureau. This is truly a miracle in the education sector in recent years. When I raised this case last time, I had no prejudice or intention to deliberately make things difficult.

### Request to Cancel Electricity Restrictions, Decision to First Stop Wire-Cutting Measures

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, senators offered opinions to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, regarding the issue of electricity restrictions. Senator Wang Zhuyi told the director to request the cancellation of electricity restrictions from February 1 and to abolish the wire-cutting method. Senator Zhu Fuzhu hoped that the bureau would temporarily restrict electric heating but not restrict electric lighting, as the New Year was approaching. For city households, the wire-cutting method has been decided to be canceled, and all relevant personnel were notified to stop wire-cutting the day before yesterday.

### Mayor Wu Submits Two More Proposals

[Reported by This Newspaper] Mayor Wu continued to submit two proposals to the Municipal Senate yesterday, as follows:

(1) To restore all city streetlights to their pre-war state to meet the needs of the citizens and to include it in the budget. Request for approval. (2) As the city's traffic congestion situation is becoming increasingly serious and must be resolved, in addition to the engineering department submitting a separate proposal for discussion, the recently proposed measures regarding vehicles and vendors are submitted for public decision.

### Tao Baichuan Reports on Participation in Constitution-Making Process

[Reported by This Newspaper] Municipal Senator and National Assembly Representative Tao Baichuan reported to the General Assembly on his participation in the constitution-making process yesterday before the second meeting began. He briefly stated that the following matters within the constitution were particularly related to the rights of Shanghai citizens: (A) The representation of Shanghai citizens in the new political system: Shanghai can elect eight representatives to participate in the National Assembly. Colleagues and others repeatedly requested amendments to make it proportional to the population, but the results were not passed. For legislators, it is stipulated that eighteen cities and provinces are proportional to the population, with one representative elected for every million people over three million, so this city can elect six committee members. As for the number of seats for supervisory committee members, municipalities directly under the central government produce two or three. Colleagues and others have also repeatedly requested an increase, but it was not accepted by the review committee. (B) The autonomy rights of Shanghai citizens at the local level: The autonomy rights of municipalities directly under the central government have not been guaranteed by the constitution. Mr. Tao will propose to the Municipal Senate to petition the central government to guarantee citizens' autonomy rights on this point.

### Teachers' Respect Fund Procedures Not Cleared

(1) It is said that more than 10 million [currency unit] in procedures for the Teachers' Respect Fund have not yet been cleared. Who is currently in charge of this fund? Which bank is it deposited in? How are the interest proceeds handled? (3) Regarding the issue of food expenses for normal school students, according to my knowledge, there are only over 700 normal school students in this city, but the Education Bureau's budget lists 1,000 people. And the usual food expenses for schools are 30,000 to 40,000 [currency unit] per person per month. Why is the budget as high as 50,000 to 70,000 [currency unit]? Is it also because it includes seat donations? Those in attendance laughed loudly upon hearing this. Zhao Yangxiong continued to speak about the issue of abolishing art teachers, stating: After the case was resolved last time,

### Most of the Previous Resolutions Have Not Been Implemented

Ma Junshuo questioned how various bureaus had implemented the resolutions of the First General Assembly, stating: The majority of the resolutions have not been implemented to date. According to the Secretariat's report, out of 175 cases submitted, 64 have been answered, and 111 have not. And whether those that have been answered have been implemented is still a question, and those that have not been answered are even more baffling. Such a lack of explanation will greatly disappoint the five million citizens.

Mayor Wu immediately responded to the quiet implementation of the resolutions, stating: I feel very fearful. The facts are slightly different from what is written. The 64 cases refer to those that have already reached a conclusion, and the others are about to reach a conclusion or are still in progress. I sincerely express my determination to faithfully implement all resolutions and will never shirk responsibility.

### Do More Positive Work in Social and Industrial/Commercial Administration

There were relatively few questions for the Social Affairs Bureau. Lu Yinchu asked: Under the pressure of high-interest loans, how many public pawnshops have been established to benefit ordinary citizens, and what are the results? Xu Yongzuo stated: It is hoped that more positive guidance, improvement, and management work can be done in the areas of social, industrial, and commercial administration, and less negative work of prohibition. Zhu Wende stated: (1) This year's cotton harvest in the suburbs has been abundant, but because manufacturers are using American cotton, prices have not only not risen but have fallen instead, and farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy. Does the Social Affairs Bureau have any relief measures? (2) According to the Social Affairs Bureau's report, many cooperatives have been established, but their performance is not being managed. It is said that when allocating goods to manufacturers, they often refuse or deliberately make things difficult. (3) Regarding the issue of temple properties at the Jing'an Temple a few days ago, mutual attacks were seen in the newspapers again. Does the Social Affairs Bureau supervise temples? Yu Chuanding stated: The Social Affairs Bureau's registration of businesses is not divided by region, will this lead to duplication?

### Seriously Discuss the Budget, Reschedule the Agenda

[Reported by This Newspaper] Senator Xu Yongzuo and others believe that reviewing the municipal government's budget for 1947 is the most important work of the General Assembly and must be carefully studied and analyzed before a decision can be made. He believes that the last review of the budget was not serious enough, so he proposed a temporary motion to change the agenda, adding two more subcommittee review meetings and one General Assembly review meeting, specifically for discussing the budget. After it was passed, it was submitted to the Secretariat to schedule the agenda.

Mayor Wu also spoke to reporters about the budget issue yesterday, reiterating that the municipal government had to increase personnel for construction and municipal administration, and the budget had been reduced as much as possible. However, he admitted: "In reality, because the market is sluggish, citizens feel that the burden is too heavy; otherwise, they would definitely feel that the budget is not too large."

### Jiangwan Stadium Destroyed by Explosion; Request Compensation for Losses; Request the Municipal Government to Negotiate with the Ministry of National Defense

[Reported by This Newspaper] Twenty-nine senators, including Xu Zerang, stated that the Jiangwan Municipal Stadium was large in scale and magnificent in construction, and was one of the best in the country. It was not damaged during the enemy occupation period, but after the victory, the municipal government did not take it over, and it was occupied by the Ministry of National Defense. This time, it was severely damaged due to a munitions depot explosion. Yesterday, they jointly submitted an emergency motion to the General Assembly, requesting the municipal government to negotiate with the Ministry of National Defense to allocate funds to compensate for the losses, so as to maintain public property and benefit education. The General Assembly passed the motion with a majority of 86 votes and submitted it to the municipal government for handling.

### Raising the Issue of Vendors, Unanimously Blaming the Police Bureau; Arbitrary Confiscation of Goods; For Public Use? For Private Use?

There were many questions about the Police Bureau, involving vendor incidents, with much criticism. Zhang Zhihan stated: In the last General Assembly, I asked how many street vendors there were and how many goods the Police Bureau had confiscated. At that time, Director Guan replied that the goal was not to confiscate. But to this day, police are still seen arbitrarily confiscating goods and driving away with them. This must not be the intention of the police authorities. I personally witnessed a police officer getting out of a jeep at the entrance of a lane on Fourth Road, taking two pieces of leather from a leather craftsman's carrying pole. The leather craftsman asked if he could take one piece less, but the police officer ignored him, got in the car, and drove away. The jeep was full of oranges and American goods, etc. In the end, do they go to public use, or to private use? Nowadays, if some police officers want to eat oranges, they go to a vendor and take them as they please, even taking extras home. Lu Yinchu continued to question the Police Bureau, asking why the fines for violations of regulations should be announced monthly. What was the reason for not announcing them in the past? He also stated that whenever an emergency occurs in this city, Mayor Wu personally goes to the scene to inspect, which is admirable. But Director Xuan cannot be seen, is it because he is busy with public affairs, or with private affairs? Xu Yongzuo stated: When the vendor incident occurred, my office was a stone's throw away from the Huangpu Sub-bureau, and I heard and saw that the authorities were too hasty at the beginning, otherwise, the matter would not have escalated. Although the matter has passed, the police authorities should bear full responsibility. One cannot reduce the livelihood of small vendors for the sake of cleaning up the city's appearance. In connection with this, I think of the issue of banning rickshaws. If they are banned, their livelihood will be lost. If it is said that rickshaws are inhumane, then the sedan chair carriers in the interior and the porters on the docks are even more inhumane, should they also be banned? I hope the municipal authorities will proceed carefully.

Shao Yongsheng stated: Beautifying the city's appearance is not possible at the moment. Urban decoration work can only be done after the people's general life is stable. The Police Bureau's budget for this year has increased by more than 6,000 police officers. I think we can use volunteer police instead to reduce the budget. However, the quality of volunteer police should be improved. Lu Huiming stated: The Police Bureau's handling of the vendor incident was excessive and should be handled carefully in the future. Qu Yue stated: It is a fact that police salaries are low. Leaders should consider whether they are enough to maintain a minimum standard of living and find ways to provide relief or carry out welfare projects, otherwise, there will be many abuses. And the vendor incident caused a great uproar. At the time, why did the Police Bureau detain so many vendors? Was there anything that was not done well enough? Wang Weiyin stated: The last General Assembly resolved to request the municipal government to include 1 billion [currency unit] in the budget for supplementing fire-fighting equipment. And request the municipal government to consult with the Relief Administration to allocate 50 motorized vehicles to assist in fire-fighting. The municipal government's report did not mention it, but in reality, the security police expenditure for the first half of the year has exceeded the budget. Why was it not used when it should have been, and more was used for other things instead? Zhu Wenqi stated: According to the Police Bureau's budget, it plans to take back the fire-fighting associations in Nanshi and Zhabei to be run by the public sector. In fact, private management is not necessarily bad. Ding Shanming and Lu Yinchu stated: The last General Assembly resolved to abolish the mounted patrol unit. This time, the Police Bureau submitted a request for reconsideration. What is the reason? Senator Ding also stated: The Police Bureau once said that the pressure on the mounted patrol unit was great. Recently, there have been robberies in the Beixinjing area every night. Can the mounted patrol unit go to the area to patrol and suppress them? Xie Dahuang stated: (1) The mayor reported that 100 percent of kidnapping cases in the past three months have been solved. Recently, in the suburbs, due to the work of suppressing bandits, families are being robbed everywhere, and people are being openly arrested. (2) Registered and examined opium addicts are all complaining that they are living like prisoners. It is hoped that attention will be paid to improving the situation. Zhang Zhihan stated: Many "water rats" have already been arrested by the police. According to reports, some police officers are also colluding in large-scale theft cases. Chen Kai stated: The organization of self-defense forces is for the purpose of protecting oneself, not for causing trouble. Why is the Police Bureau not allowing them to organize? Yu Chuanding stated: The Police Bureau's household registration survey work cost a total of 1.4 billion [currency unit]. Is there a duplication with the work of the Civil Affairs Bureau? The Police Bureau's museum duplicates the one run by the Education Bureau, and it seems that they can be merged to save expenses. And the Police Hospital's expenses last year totaled over 120 million [currency unit]. There is one hospital for the city's 20,000 police officers, but only eight municipal hospitals for millions of citizens. Therefore, the Police Hospital should be changed to a municipal hospital. Female Senator Tong Daoyuan stated: The police are cracking down on prostitution and plan to establish a women's relief agency with the Social Affairs Bureau, with the aim of establishing it in the shortest possible time.

Material Supply Situation; External Complaints and Criticisms; Decision to Request the Director of the Material Supply Bureau to Attend and Report

[Reported by This Newspaper] Twenty-one senators, including Feng Youzhen, submitted an emergency motion yesterday: "Please send a letter to the Director of the Material Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, requesting him to attend the General Assembly and report on the material supply situation." The reason for this is: The Executive Yuan established the Material Supply Bureau in Shanghai, and the name implies that its main task is to supply materials to relieve people's needs, not to engage in business for profit. This is clear. However, since the bureau was established, there have been external complaints and criticisms about the supply of materials, especially the supply of jeeps and military blankets, and many have been dissatisfied. Some say that the prices charged by the bureau for the supplies are too high, which undermines the true meaning of supply. Others say that the bureau's selection of recipients for the supplies depends entirely on their power, status, and personal connections with people in the bureau. Some even say that they use the supply of materials for black market trading to profit from it. We dare not draw conclusions about the truth, but as this council represents the interests of the city's citizens, we have a sacred mission to rectify discipline and establish a clean government. It is necessary to have a clear understanding of the material supply situation of the Material Supply Bureau, such as: (1) the sources and quantities of various materials and their original selling prices, (2) the standards and methods for allocating materials, (3) the recipients of the allocations and their lists, (4) whether there is black market trading to profit from it, etc. Therefore, we submit an emergency motion to send a letter to the Director of the Material Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan, requesting him to attend this council and report in detail.

### Accompanying Personnel and Carrying Data; Zhang Wei Suffers Siege

Yesterday's agenda was to question the heads of the Police, Social Affairs, Health, and Education Bureaus. Each bureau director brought a large number of accompanying personnel, such as secretaries and section chiefs, and carried a large amount of data to the scene, waiting to be "questioned." The Education Bureau even hung charts on the four walls of the meeting place. Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau suffered a "siege." Because of time constraints, the other three bureaus were able to postpone answering the questions until today. A certain senator said: "It's too cheap for them to have so much preparation." Director Gu Chunfan of the Finance Bureau, Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Director Zhu Ping of the Land Bureau all attended the meeting as observers. Director Zhao held a pipe in his hand, looking very leisurely.

Senator Zhang Zhihan said that if the common people are not good, there is a police management system. Now that the police are not good, there should be a system for managing the police.

Xu Yongzuo opened fire on the military service issue, advocating that Shanghai should temporarily postpone conscription. His words were激烈, and in the middle of his speech, there was continuous hissing from the right front seats.

Xu said that Shanghai soldiers are either young masters or old masters, and they may die during training.

During the break, Mayor Wu left his seat to talk to Xu, saying that Shanghai cannot not talk about conscription, otherwise, people from the countryside will all come to Shanghai.

Fei Shusheng spoke eloquently on the issue of military service, refuting Xu Yongzuo and considering it an insult.

Zhu Wende asked a unique question, raising issues about land value tax. Director Zhu Ping of the Land Bureau was calm on the sidelines because the Land Bureau was not on yesterday's agenda.

The General Assembly was postponed again and again and adjourned at six o'clock. The directors of the various bureaus waiting to answer questions were nervous. They were "liberated" only when the meeting adjourned at six o'clock, waiting to be asked again today.

Four stoves were burning in the meeting place, but there was no heat. It was gloomy, rainy, and cold. Sitting still for four hours, everyone called out that their feet were frozen when the meeting adjourned.

### Many Areas of Health Care Still Need Improvement

Questioning the Health Bureau, in addition to garbage trucks carrying passengers and cargo, Jiang Hao also asked: (1) The Health Bureau is a business organization and should focus on the development of medical services. Recently, it has not been paying for the expenses of municipal hospitals, but instead, it is ordering them to be self-sufficient, and the cost of diagnosis and treatment has increased, which increases the burden on the people and violates the principle of public welfare. (2) It is said that clinics should be distributed in various districts, just like schools. Recently, they have been ordered to be concentrated and merged, which is also inappropriate. (3) The issue of feces has become an open secret. In the past, those who handled it had the nickname "King." After the victory against Japan, the government changed it to be run by the public sector. Recently, I heard that they are going to implement a contract system again, which is wrong. (4) If the Health Bureau reduces its operations, will it also reduce personnel? Wang Lizhan asked: (1) Last year's epidemic prevention work only averaged about 1 percent of the city's population per injection. The spread of the epidemic was not large. One cannot say that the work was successful, but only that it was fortunate. How will this be improved this year? (2) The last General Assembly resolved to establish health clinics and dental clinics everywhere, but only the establishment of health clinics has been reported, and dental clinics have not been reported at all. According to the health expenditure, there is still one year left in the budget. Why can't it be promoted?

### Military Service Issue, Different Opinions; Xu Yongzuo Believes It Should Not Be Enforced, Fei Shusheng Says It Can Be Used to Strengthen Physical Fitness

[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the military service issue, Senators Xu Yongzuo and Fei Shusheng raised it in yesterday's General Assembly, but their opinions were quite different, which made the atmosphere in the arena tense. According to Senator Xu, conscription will begin this year. In the past, I saw the conscription situation in the interior and was terrified. After eight years of resistance against Japan, the people suffered greatly. I hope to give the people a rest. China has a volunteer army system, so there is no need for compulsion. Unlike the United Kingdom and the United States, where life is stable and people are unwilling to be regular soldiers, compulsion is necessary. Currently, the government is reducing the army on one hand and conscripting on the other, is this not contradictory? Some people say that serving in the army is an obligation, which is stipulated in the constitution. However, the constitution has not yet been implemented, and the rights that the people should have have not been obtained, so the obligation should also be fulfilled more slowly. Especially the people of Shanghai, who have lived in the city for too long, have weakened physiques. Recruiting them for military service will result in either young master soldiers or old master soldiers, and they will lose their lives before training is completed. The country's conscription facilities have not yet been established. Is it going to order the people to send their lives? Therefore, I urge the speaker to request a temporary postponement of conscription of citizens in this city.

Senator Fei disagreed with this point. He said: The constitution stipulates military service. Although the constitution has not yet been implemented, serving in the army is a citizen's obligation. Is it possible that the country does not want it because the rights that should be given in the constitution have not been obtained? At the same time, if you say that the rights have not been obtained, who gave us all the rights that the people have now? If you say that the citizens of Shanghai have weak physiques and cannot be regular soldiers, this is really the greatest shame for the people of Shanghai. If the people are not physically strong, are they worthy of being citizens of China? Moreover, conscription does not necessarily mean going to war. This is a good opportunity to strengthen physical fitness. However, I hope that the Civil Affairs Bureau will seriously consider this matter and prevent abuses from arising.

### Families of Victims of Plane Crash Decide to Jointly File a Private Prosecution

[Reported by This Newspaper] The "Committee to Seek Justice for the Passengers Killed in the December 25 Plane Crash" continued to meet at the New Life Club yesterday morning to discuss measures for the aftermath and to seek justice. On the spot, it was decided to take steps to demand the punishment of the perpetrators. The investigation has been stopped, so the families decided to file a private criminal prosecution against China and Central Airlines. They will collect materials and evidence within a few days and convene all family members again to write a petition, sign it, and seal it before submitting it to the court. Yesterday, the committee also publicly agreed to have each family contribute 100,000 [currency unit] as litigation and other expenses and to use the Law Office of Le Junwei as the office. They are determined to negotiate with the company and the authorities to the end.

### Major Thieves Caught: Stealing Military Pants from Yongxing Warehouse, and Sugar and Tobacco from Haikang Ship

[Our Report] On December 22nd of last year, around 4:30 AM, four thieves, Cai Hongsheng, Li Wanyin, Li Wanqing, and Wu Wanyuan, arrived at the Yongxing Warehouse opposite the Huishan Wharf in eastern Shanghai. One acted as a lookout, while the others broke open the warehouse and stole seven large packages of American military pants, each containing fifty pairs. They transported them to No. 24 Taoyuan Lane, Huimin Road, to hide them in Tang Caikang's home. The following morning, around 4:00 AM, they returned to the same location to steal another six large packages, intending to move them again. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by patrolmen stationed at the warehouse just a few steps away, and they abandoned the loot and fled without a trace. The stolen goods were then seized by the Water Police Investigation Department. On New Year's Eve, the Water Police Sub-bureau received a tip and dispatched police officers to investigate and arrest the thieves Cai Hongsheng, Li Wanyin, Li Wanqing, and Wu Wanyuan. However, the receiver of stolen goods, Tang Caikang, escaped. Only his wife, Zhu Sannan, was taken to the bureau for investigation. According to Cai Hongsheng's confession, Tang had Letonghe deliver 20 pairs of American military pants to him on the afternoon of the 29th of the month, and the rest were divided among them.

[Another Report] Water Police Chief Pan Ruiqi and Police Officer Dai Youfu were on duty on the Haikang ship in the Huangpu River around 7:00 AM on the 2nd when they spotted a suspicious small boat with three people on board attempting to steal from the ship. They immediately took the three to the bureau for interrogation. It was revealed that one was Jin Xiaoxiazi (25 years old, from Yangzhou, living on a boat in Longhua Port), one was Guo Shirong (from Chongming, 28 years old, living on Zhangjiabang Road, Pudong), and one was Yuan Chunsai (from Gaoyou, 29 years old, living at No. 20 Yanjiataki, Pudong). According to Yuan Chunbao's confession: "I'm a boat rower. Jin Xiaoxiazi and Guo Shirong, along with someone named Li (who is now at large), hired my boat to steal things from the Haikang ship. The first time, around 2:00 AM, we stole a large wooden crate of Pan cigarettes and a sack of white sugar (weighing about 100 catties) from the ship and took it to Dongjiadu in Pudong. The second time, around 4:00 AM, we were arrested before we could steal anything." According to Jin Xiaoxiazi and Yuan Shirong's confessions, the stolen goods were hidden in a tea house at the Dongjiadu dock. Upon receiving the report, the Water Police Bureau dispatched police officers to retrieve all the stolen goods. It is understood that the stolen goods belong to Chengxin Chang Company at No. 2 Hengye Lane, Jiangxi Road, and were intended to be shipped to Qingdao. The Water Police Bureau has notified them to claim the goods.

### The District Attorney's Office is Busy with Bail Procedures: More Than 100 Suspects in Minor Cases Happily Released From Prison; Procedures Will Be Completed After the Detailed Amnesty Rules Arrive

[Our Report] Since the Central Government has issued an amnesty decree, although the detailed rules of the amnesty have not yet been announced, the prosecutors of the District Attorney's Office, in order to show consideration for the suspects in custody, have selected cases that are relatively minor and clearly fall within the scope of the amnesty. They have allowed them to be released on bail first, and will complete the overall release procedures after the detailed rules for the implementation of the amnesty are received. More than 80 suspects were allowed to be released on bail the day before yesterday, and more than 50 were allowed to be released yesterday, bringing the total to more than 140 in the past two days. The forensic doctors are busy with bail procedures and other matters, and they are working until late at night. It is expected that a large number of defendants will apply for bail in the next two days. However, this is not a formal amnesty release, but a preparatory work by the prosecutors before the amnesty.

Yesterday, a reporter visited a person in charge of the Shanghai Prison, who told us: After the amnesty decree was issued, among the more than 4,000 prisoners detained in the prison, more than 3,000 ordinary criminals met the standards for commutation or exemption from punishment. It will not be possible to determine who can be released and who can have their sentences reduced until the detailed measures are received. The remaining 700-odd traitors have all violated item one of Article B of the amnesty decree and have no hope of commutation. He expressed considerable doubt about the news that the Capital District Court had released more than 30 prisoners, because the detailed measures have not yet been announced and there is no way to follow them. It is likely that those whose crimes have been determined have been allowed to go out on bail first.

[Another Report] Since the National Government issued the amnesty decree, all sectors have been paying close attention and speculating about which defendants will be pardoned and which defendants will have their sentences reduced. A reporter interviewed a legal expert, who said that the amnesty is a special grace of the state, and the scope of this amnesty is very broad. Except for traitors and corrupt officials, all will be pardoned or have their sentences reduced. However, before the detailed rules for the implementation of the amnesty are announced, it is not convenient to make a definite judgment on the fate of the defendants in each case. For example, the famous grain loan case, according to the prosecutor's indictment, involves the regulations on the management of agriculture, industry, and commerce during the extraordinary period, and should indeed be included in the amnesty. However, the case is in the process of trial, and the judge has the right to change the new articles according to law. If the sentence is imposed according to the regulations on punishing corruption, it cannot be pardoned. Recently, it has been rumored that the court will declare "non-acceptance" of the case, which seems impossible. The so-called amnesty is because the person is guilty and needs to be pardoned. Although the original sentence and the crime committed cannot be prosecuted again after the amnesty, it is different from "insufficient evidence" and "the crime cannot be established." If the examination law and the lawyer law stipulate that those who have been subject to criminal punishment are not allowed to participate in the college entrance examination or practice law. This kind of restriction on passive qualifications is very beneficial to the country and society and should not be affected by the amnesty. In other words, even if someone has been sentenced to imprisonment for a criminal case and has been pardoned, they still cannot immediately participate in the college entrance examination or become a lawyer. Because the person still has "traces of crime," their passive qualifications are different from those who have never committed a crime. President Cha of the District Court has repeatedly stated that the trial of each case should proceed as usual, and that even cases that are expected to be pardoned or reduced must be handled through judicial procedures. According to Article 294, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, those who have been granted amnesty should be given a judgment of dismissal. Therefore, it is expected that the court will apply this procedure to all amnesty cases.

### Principal Zhang's Loyalty is a Mystery: Accused of Being a Traitor; Witnesses Say He Helped the Resistance

[Our Report] Zhang Zili, formerly the principal of the Dongchang Private Elementary School in Pudong, later renamed Dongju Elementary School, has been accused of being a traitor. Yesterday afternoon, witnesses Chen Ruxi, Rong Zhenbiao, and Song Shide were summoned. According to them, the defendant joined the Three People's Principles Youth League as a member and was ordered to serve as an intelligence officer in the 5th District of Shanghai, as well as the acting secretary and liaison officer of the 7th District Branch, assisting in underground work. The textbooks used by the school were compiled and printed by the Pudong Fellow Association. They also presented two old textbooks in court. They also said that the puppet Education Bureau wanted to change the school into a municipal school, but the defendant refused, etc. The court ordered a postponement for further interrogation.

### Wang Renshan's Interrogation Ends; Bao Qihuang Returns to Beijing to Report

[Our Report] After Wang Renshan, the director of the Jiangwan Ordnance Depot branch of the First Supply District of the Logistics Command, surrendered himself, the Ministry of National Defense sent Chief Military Justice Bao Qihuang to Shanghai again for trial. After Bao conducted a preliminary investigation with Yan Zizuo, deputy director of the Hudong Investigation Office of the Garrison Command, the day before yesterday afternoon, he convened a collegial panel for a public trial yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM with Zeng Zhaoyi, director of the Military Justice Department of the Garrison Command, and Tao Yishan, director of the Investigation Office, which lasted until around 4:00 PM. It is understood that the results of the joint trial did not reveal any new findings. In addition to negligence, Wang Renshan's crime was that he once fled to avoid punishment. Although he has now surrendered himself, the sentence will still be heavier than that of Chuan Jimin, the director of the general depot. Director Bao is scheduled to return to Beijing today to report the trial and the proposed sentence to Vice Minister Qin Dechun, the presiding judge of the case, for approval by the highest authorities.

### The Case of Stabbing a Rickshaw Puller: Rogers Begins Interrogation

### The End of the Oehler Case: The Defendant Presents Favorable Evidence

[Our Report] The final conclusion of the Oehler espionage case is approaching. Like a lengthy drama, the gongs and drums have reached the final act. Yesterday morning, the defense began to present favorable evidence in the US military court. One piece of evidence was an editorial in the Xin Shen Bao during the enemy-puppet period on the Axis Agreement, discussing that the contracting countries should not make peace alone. The purpose of presenting this evidence was to explain that one of the defendants, Jin Kaimai, the former director of the German News Bureau in China, cooperated with the Japanese in propaganda work out of necessity. Another piece of evidence was a diagram drawn by Pukemai of the location of the German News Bureau at No. 3 Daxilu. Also, Oehler himself intended to present two key letters to prove his testimony regarding the measures taken when Germany surrendered, but the court did not accept them because the prosecution believed that the letters were insufficient as evidence. The case will continue to be heard today, and the prosecution will begin to rebut the evidence presented by the defense.

### Moviegoers, Please Keep Your Ticket Stubs: The Theaters are Requesting a Tax Reduction

[Our Report] The Shanghai Cinema Industry Trade Association has appealed to the Shanghai City Council for assistance in requesting the Municipal Finance Bureau to reduce the entertainment tax rate to 25% of the ticket price in accordance with central government regulations. According to reports, the National Government promulgated and amended the Entertainment Tax Law on December 4th of last year, stipulating that the tax rate should be "limited to 25% of the original price," and "no additional taxes or levies should be added under any other name." However, the municipal government is still collecting the tax at a rate of 40%. The members of the association have decided to automatically collect and pay the highest tax rate of 25% of the amended rate starting from the 6th of this month, and request the City Council to grant assistance, include it in the agenda, and recognize the association's decision to reduce the rate according to law.

The association also asked moviegoers in the city to keep the ticket stubs from the 6th of this month. Once the City Council approves the reduction of the entertainment tax rate in this city to 25%, the 15% overcharge will be returned to the audience upon presentation of the ticket stubs.

### The Student Anti-Riot Association Sent Out Representatives to Various Schools Yesterday

### The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Social Affairs Bureau to Implement the Guiding Principles of the Government and Departments; Requests for Increased Base Salaries for Employees Should Be Rejected on File

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to reject the requests of employees in various industries for increased base salaries, which violate the government's orders. The report states: In September 1935, the Shanghai Municipal Government's policy report stated that the handling of labor disputes had the following content: "In May of this year, in accordance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan, the Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee was established and ordered the committee to implement five measures for handling labor disputes, the first of which is that base salaries should not be increased." Recently, the mayor stated in his speech at the second general meeting of the City Council that the economic crisis, along with high wages and usury, indicated that a short-sighted policy of killing the hen to get the eggs should not be adopted for general wage issues. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs also stated at the meeting of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the 6th District on January 4th of this year that employee treatment should have a considerable limit. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs also made a clear statement to stop increasing base salaries. The competent government departments have already made fair policy announcements, which should be faithfully implemented. Unfortunately, recent trends seem to be contrary to this, and it is necessary for the competent officials to act as a third party to fairly adjudicate and persuade, in order to barely maintain the precarious situation. If the government orders are equal to setting up a false front and the precedents are overturned at any time, then the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors will only collapse completely, which is only a matter of time and not a one-sided speculation. The association is deeply concerned and cautious day and night, and should respectfully submit this report. It is requested that all requests for increased base salaries made by employees in various industries to the employers, under any name, be rejected on file in order to maintain the consistency of the government orders and allow the industrial and commercial sectors to barely survive.

### The Executive Yuan Stipulates Measures for the Execution of Confiscated Traitor Properties: Standards Have Been Set for the Issuance of Living Expenses to Family Members

The Executive Yuan has recently stipulated measures for the execution of the confiscated properties of traitors and the standards for the valuation and collection of enemy-puppet properties, and has issued a notice to the enemy-puppet property management bureaus in various places for compliance. The Enemy-Puppet Property Clearing Office of the Su, Zhe, and Anhui districts of the Central Trust Bureau has also received the order. The original text is listed as follows:

### Execution Precautions

1.  Precautions for the execution of confiscated properties of traitors: (1) After the judgment of the traitor case is finalized, if the quantity and value of the property to be confiscated is small, it shall be executed by the prosecutor of the court in conjunction with the enemy-puppet property management bureau. If the property is not located in the location of the court, the chief prosecutor of the court shall order or entrust the prosecutor of the local court or the county judicial organ where the traitor property is located to handle it, and the personnel in charge of the prosecutor shall execute it in conjunction with the enemy-puppet property management bureau. In places where there is no enemy-puppet property management bureau, it shall be executed in conjunction with the local government. (2) If local people or interested parties object to the orders of the above-mentioned enforcement personnel or their enforcement methods, they shall be handled in accordance with the execution procedures of the Criminal Procedure Law. (3) If a person claiming rights to the confiscated property submits evidence that the prosecutor deems insufficient, he may be ordered to file a lawsuit in the local court, with the original prosecutor as the defendant. (Refer to Yuanzi No. 1886).

The entrusted agencies shall not refuse. (5) In addition to referring to the Compulsory Enforcement Law and other relevant laws, if the value of the traitor's property is estimated to be more than 500 yuan, the auditing agency should be notified to supervise it in accordance with Article 3 of the Measures for Auditing Agencies to Inspect Construction Projects and Purchase and Sale Properties of Various Agencies. However, this does not apply to the location in the auditing agency. (6) The execution of the confiscation of the traitor's real estate, which has not yet been sold or approved for allocation according to law, shall be transferred to the local financial authorities for management in accordance with the Public Land Management Measures.

### Xie Jinyuan's Wife Pleads with Tears in Her Eyes: Appealing for Relief for the Lone Army; They Have No Cotton-Padded Clothes for the Coming Winter; Their Hunger and Cold are Extremely Pitiable

[Our Report] In the winter of 1937, the lone army defended the Sihang Warehouse to the death, protecting Shanghai. The eight hundred warriors, whose actions shocked the international community, have experienced ten years of hardship, wandering and exile. Forty-six of them have returned to Shanghai since the victory. Unfortunately, the lives of these dozens of national heroes are on the verge of hunger and cold and urgently need relief from the authorities and people from all walks of life. Ling Weicheng, the widow of the late Regiment Commander Xie, pleaded for these dozens of national heroes yesterday, and tearfully reported the current situation of the lone army's life to the press in the New Concession at the Lone Army Service Agency on Aosong Road, unable to restrain her grief and indignation. According to Mrs. Xie, these 46 people still have no cotton-padded clothes to wear in this severe winter. They sleep together on the stone floor of the Lone Army Service Agency every night, covering themselves only with burlap bags to keep out the cold. The old, the weak, the disabled, and the sick are on the verge of death. Although Chairman Chiang issued a hand-order to the Enemy-Puppet Property Management Bureau to allocate houses for them to live in, they have not yet been allocated. In order to find work and maintain their livelihood, the lone army has repeatedly petitioned the Municipal Government to allocate a pier, but several months have passed and no effective measures have been taken. The Dada Pier is also not allowing the lone army to work, etc. It is reported that Mrs. Xie originally planned to go to the Nanyang area to raise funds to start a school after the lone army's life was resolved. After the equipment of the Lone Army Factory, which the lone army comrades founded in the Lone Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road, was robbed by the enemy, they have been unable to resume work. In the near future, more than 30 members of the lone army who were released from the Nanyang enemy prisoner-of-war camps will come to Shanghai from Hong Kong. It is hoped that the authorities and people in Shanghai will provide them with relief on the condition of exchanging labor for a living.

### The Joint Transportation and Operation Office is Discussing the Takeover of the UNRRA Water Transport Team

The China Shipping Industry Joint Transportation and Operation Office held its first meeting yesterday after its establishment.

The official takeover will not begin until the following difficult issues are resolved: (1) The retention of the Water Transport Team's crew members, as well as their treatment, guarantees, and insurance after the takeover. (2) Because most of the crew members are foreigners, a large amount of foreign exchange must be obtained before they can be paid, which is subject to approval by the Central Bank.

[Our Report] According to the Joint Operation Office yesterday, the landing craft to be taken over by the Water Transport Team include 20 LSTs, 16 LSMs, 12 FSs, and 5 LTs, as well as dozens of smaller ships. The takeover is expected to begin in early next month.

### Trial of a Murder Case: Paramour Claims Sole Responsibility; Shameless Woman Denies Involvement; Deceased's Mother Seeks Compensation

[Our report] Cheng Cuiyun, a female worker at the Shenxin Textile Factory, and her paramour Xu Meifang, were publicly tried yesterday at the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court for the joint murder of Cheng's husband, Gu Yucai. Cheng Cuiyun is from Chongming, currently 30 years old. She married Gu Yucai, a fellow villager, at the age of 18. A year after the marriage, Cheng came to Shanghai to work at the Shenxin Textile Factory. During the Anti-Japanese War, Cheng left the factory and returned to her hometown. In March of last year, she returned to Shanghai to work at the factory, residing at the home of Xinghua, a fellow factory worker, at 7 Tanjiachiao Road, Zhabei. Through Xinghua's introduction, she became acquainted with Xu Meifang, a neighbor. Xu, from Suzhou, is 35 years old and works as a carpenter. His wife had passed away. After meeting Cheng, he began living with her,

as if husband and wife.

In October of last year, Cheng returned to Chongming. Her husband, Gu Yucai, asked her to find him a job in Shanghai and gave her 800,000 yuan in cash to take to Shanghai, in case he couldn't find a job and needed capital for a small business. Cheng returned to Shanghai first, agreeing that her husband would come to Shanghai around the tenth day of the tenth lunar month. After returning to Shanghai with the money, Cheng Cuiyun secretly plotted with Xu Meifang to murder Gu. On the tenth day, Gu Yucai came to Shanghai, and Cheng Cuiyun

met him at the dock.

She took him to a restaurant for a simple meal and then to the Wing On Department Store and the Tianyun Lou for entertainment. Around 7 PM, she pretended to have arranged a meeting with someone who could introduce him to a job, luring her husband to take a car to the North Railway Station. After getting off the car, they walked together, turning from Qiujiang Road into Zhongxing Road. At the intersection of Yuyaotang Road, the area was desolate and dark. Xu Meifang, who had been secretly following them all day, saw his opportunity. He produced a pre-prepared hemp rope, rushed up from behind, and violently tightened it around Gu's neck. Cheng also assisted in strangling him to death, and they threw the body into a ditch. Cheng and Xu fled home, believing that the matter was

secret and unknown.

Unexpectedly, the police station uncovered the details and arrested Cheng and Xu, transferring them to the District Prosecutor's Office, where the prosecutor filed a public prosecution. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Shaochang presided over the trial. Xu directly admitted to killing Gu, claiming he acted alone. Cheng also denied participating in the murder of her husband. Gu Yucai's 71-year-old mother also came to court yesterday, filing a civil suit seeking 20 million yuan in living expenses and the 800,000 yuan previously handed over. The court hearing was adjourned for another session, and both defendants were returned to custody.

### He Zhuguo Loses Sight, To Seek Long-Term Recovery in Hangzhou

[Our report] General He Zhuguo, who went to the United States last spring to treat his eye disease, returned to the country on the American Great Northern Company's "Wildcat" ship on the 31st of last month, arriving in Shanghai. He is currently staying at a friend's home and plans to go to Hangzhou for a two-year long-term recovery within the shortest possible time. When the reporter visited yesterday, he said: Since participating in an international banquet in September of the year before last, he soon suffered from eye disease and eventually became completely blind. He went to the United States for treatment in February of last year. After being diagnosed by famous doctors at the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, they all said that He's optic nerves were not injured or caused by fatigue. If he can get a long-term suitable recovery, he can expect to regain his sight in two or three years. Because the cost in the United States is high, He decided to return to the country and stay in Hangzhou for recovery. He had a lot of contact with people from all walks of life in the United States, hoping that our country would take this opportunity to build the country, achieve peaceful unification, and engage in the great cause of revitalization.

### Traffic Police Destroy Yue Opera Theater, Reprimanded After Interrogation

Yesterday, the military law office summoned Zhang Chunfan, the manager of the Guotai Theater, and Li Zaiping, the captain of the traffic police brigade. Both parties expressed their willingness to reconcile. The military law office said that the case was a matter of injury and damage, which is a crime that is prosecuted only upon complaint. Since both parties are willing to reconcile, they can refuse to accept it. The more than 20 soldiers involved were reprimanded and released, and Li was ordered to take them back and strictly discipline them.

### Port Affairs Committee Patrols, Cracks Two Smuggling Cases in New Year, Pure Antimony Worth Billions, Goods Moved to YMCA, Owners Released on Bail

[Our report] Zhong Jie, director of the Patrol and Security Team of the Shanghai Port Affairs Reorganization Committee, received a tip on the evening of the 31st of last month that the Shalilai tugboat, moored at the Rihui Port pier, was carrying smuggled goods. Director Zhong dispatched personnel to the scene on the morning of New Year's Day, together with the Rihui Port Water Police Station, and seized the goods and the smugglers. The smuggled goods included 100 cartons of Camel cigarettes, six wool blankets, 46 and a half dozen long silk dance socks, 92 bundles of four-strand wool, two cans of coffee, one raincoat, 14 pieces of pure wool fabric, and three woolen sweaters, one coat fabric, etc., worth more than 30 million yuan. The owner claimed to be Li Abao, manager of the Central Laundry Company, who colluded with the ship's crew members Zhou Sen, Yu Xingming, and others to hide the smuggled goods in the laundry and transport them to the pier. All the smuggled goods were confiscated by the team and handed over to the Jianghai Customs for safekeeping the day before yesterday, and the owners and crew members were released on bail. On January 3, inspector Chen Qi of the team reported that the owner, Dai Shenzhou, had shipped 643 blocks of pure antimony weighing 12,008 kilograms (approximately over 12 tons) worth several hundred million yuan from Hankou on the Chufu ship, which arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and was unloaded at the Swire Pier and hidden in a secret room at 6A Taikang Road. Based on the report, the team went to the address and seized all the antimony blocks. Because it was a national defense metal purchased and sold by the government, the team handed it over to the Foreign Trade Office of the Resources Committee. The owner, Dai Shenzhou, was temporarily allowed to be released on bail. The team has submitted a request for commendation to encourage informants and investigators.

### Diminished Curiosity, Business at American Goods Malls Plummets

[Our report] Last September, due to the municipal government's crackdown on American goods vendors, American goods malls sprang up in response, and their business was better than that of ordinary stores. However, in recent months, due to foreign exchange supply and demand and other factors, orders from various businesses to the United States have greatly decreased, and the general public's curiosity and enthusiasm for American goods have also decreased day by day, resulting in a sharp decline in business at American goods malls. Currently, malls such as Daguan and Small World are also engaged in domestic goods, and Sino-American malls have also combined Chinese and Western elements. According to Sino-American business

### Another Blacklisted Female Star: Yan Yuexian Sadly Imprisoned

[Our report] Film star Yan Yuexian, 29 years old, residing at No. 12, Lane 930, Zhongzheng Middle Road, was arrested for opium addiction. At around 5 PM on December 25th of last year, she went to an opium den in Hengmaoli, Xizang South Road, to indulge when police officers from the Changshu branch suddenly arrived for inspection. Yan and the opium den owner were arrested and taken to the police station. When questioned, Yan denied smoking, claiming that she had already quit and was only visiting friends. Upon instruction, she was sent to the Municipal Hospital for testing, and the results confirmed that Yan had opium addiction. She was brought back to the police station for questioning and was sent to the District Court yesterday. At around 3 PM, her younger sister, Yan Yueleng, and another person went to the court detention center to visit her. The sisters cried non-stop upon meeting. The person in charge of the mall said that when the mall was established last October, the total daily turnover was about 10 million yuan, but in November and December, it had decreased to 2 million yuan. However, compared with domestic goods, American goods still occupy an advantage. The business situation of pure domestic goods malls is even worse.

### Economic Statistics Expert Li Zhennan Discusses Price Trends Over the Past Year: Unless Fundamental Problems Are Solved, Any Economic Measures Will Be Difficult to Be Effective

[Our report] In order to review the economic and financial situation of the city in the past and to anticipate its future development, the reporter specially visited economic statistics expert Dr. Li Zhennan yesterday, who kindly agreed to meet. Dr. Li first showed statistical charts, listing the price changes of rice, flour, cotton yarn, raw silk, gold, US dollars, Chinese stocks, and government bonds. The starting point of these curves was October 1945, until the opening of the foreign exchange market in early March of last year. During this stage, the price curves of various goods were almost consistently rising in a straight line. After the opening of the foreign exchange market until August 19th of last year, when the foreign exchange rate was adjusted, rice prices fluctuated slightly due to uneven supply and demand, while gold and US dollars were almost stable as parallel lines. However, Chinese stocks tended to rise before mid-June. This was driven by frequent news of the opening of the stock exchange and the stable gold and US dollar exchange rates. After the exchange rate adjustment on August 19, the price curves of various goods fluctuated and rose again. However, Chinese stocks fell sharply due to the impact of the economic downturn. In early December of last year, due to tight credit, the price curves of various goods fell slightly. However, by the end of that month, the curves rose sharply again. Therefore, looking at the price curves of various goods over the past year, although there may have been periods of stability in the short term, the long-term trend was still upward. Dr. Li specifically pointed out that in a country where public security is unstable, the currency system is unstable, the budget cannot be balanced, and international trade imports exceed exports, the upward trend of prices is almost unavoidable. If the above-mentioned situations cannot be improved this year, then although the trend of goods may be affected by speculative factors or tight capital in the short term, the long-term trend will still be upward. Moreover, with domestic prices at a high level and imports exceeding exports, it is almost impossible for my country's international payments to be balanced. In the past year, my country's average monthly import value was about six times the export value. Therefore, he firmly believes that the government's subsequent policies will focus on strengthening the control of import trade to make up for the shortcomings of past foreign exchange management policies.

He said: Gold and US dollars are non-productive goods, but people still compete to buy them. This phenomenon can indicate two facts: (1) Faith in the already inflated currency has been lost. (2) There is no outlet for funds. In other words, there is a lack of profitable businesses to pursue. He also pointed out that before the various fundamental problems are resolved, the government's economic policies often cannot be fully implemented and are mostly both beneficial and harmful. Now let's give a few examples to illustrate it. After the implementation of the import permit system, the benefit is that it can maintain foreign exchange resources and promote domestic industry and commerce. The disadvantage is that after foreign goods cannot be imported as much as possible, the high price level in the country is implicitly supported. The central bank's gold policy benefits by contracting the currency, which can slightly curb the rise in prices. The disadvantage is that it can also freeze useful funds from the private sector, turning them into useless things, which is also not a fundamental solution. Issuing production loans benefits by assisting industrial production. The disadvantage is that it simply increases market funds and easily causes speculative storms. Another example is high interest rates, which are generally hated by people. However, high interest rates can have the effect of curbing price increases. Therefore, as summarized above, if domestic security, the currency system, and the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure are not resolved, then any economic policies of the government are only temporary and stopgap measures.

### Gold Prices Initially Hesitant, Then Rise; Foreign Currencies Remain Mediocre

Gold prices were stable yesterday, opening at 3.5 million. There was no special change after the opening. From 3.56 million, it once fell below 3.5 million, seeing a low price of 3.48 million before stabilizing slightly. After 10 AM, the central bank allocated 200 taels at 3.5 million. After that, the supply disappeared, retail purchases were numerous, and the price was firm. After noon, due to strong real demand, it rose to above 3.55 million. In the afternoon, forward purchases were numerous, and the market immediately jumped to 3.64 million. The central bank was forced to respond and re-imposed pressure, immediately reducing it to 3.54 million. It finally strengthened slightly, and the result was an increase of 55,000 from the previous close. Gold ornaments were 376,000. Silver dollars rose slightly. The interbank lending market went from loose to flooded. Interest rates seemed to fall below 1.5%.

Foreign currencies remained mediocre yesterday. The initial black market rate for US dollars in the morning was 6,100 to 6,300. Midway, it was extremely peaceful. At noon, it rose slightly with gold, to 6,300 to 6,500. Although the gold market was firm in the afternoon, the dollar market had a supply of funds but did not see a rise. Buying and selling prices were slightly squeezed together, and asking prices seemed low. The result was a slight increase of 50 yuan from the previous close. Hong Kong dollars were constrained by telegraphic transfers and did not show any strength. The result was a further decline of 20 yuan from the previous close. Transactions were rare, and few people cared about it. The Guangdong community had a small supply and demand.

### Ripples in Well Water, Government Bonds Active Again

Government bonds were still stirring yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Council's call for support for buying was still regarded as the golden rule by major bond market players, who arbitrarily raised the price. Tong Bing opened at 1,900 yuan with demand, and under the leadership of Chen and others, it rose to 3,000 yuan before Room 604 sold on behalf of the Shanghai Silk and Flowers community and returned to 2,500 yuan at the close, an increase of more than 600 yuan from the previous close. A and B rose 500 yuan, and D and E rose 600 yuan.

### Raw Silk Purchases Not Yet Sufficient, China Trust Decides to Continue Purchases

The Central Trust Bureau, which has been acting as an agent for the government to purchase raw silk since October of last year, had purchased a total of 6,345 bales of raw silk by the end of the year. According to the person in charge of the bureau, because this is still far from the original target of 10,000 bales, the bureau will continue to purchase raw silk this year, regardless of the quantity.

The Japanese rayon purchased by the Central Trust Bureau has arrived in Shanghai in two batches of 5,000 boxes each. The third batch has already departed from Tokyo and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, also with a quantity of 5,000 boxes.

### Measures for Purchasing Cotton Yarn, Draft Already Prepared

[Our report] The government's measures for purchasing cotton yarn are currently being drafted separately by the Textile Management Committee and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association. It is reported that the Textile Management Committee has already prepared the entire draft, which will generally entrust the Textile Construction Company to handle the purchase and sale of cotton yarn. The Sixth District Association is also studying the technical issues of its purchase. The association will convene a standing council meeting today, at which a decision is expected to be made. However, the final measures still need to be approved at tomorrow's Textile Management Committee meeting.

### Textile Merchants Offer Low Prices, Cotton Yarn Market Sales Quiet

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was unable to rally. Textile merchants were willing to offer low prices, such as Caikui Xing, which was sold for only 2.023 million yuan. However, sales were quiet, and transactions were scarce. The various yarns above 10 counts fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan again. The 32-count fine yarn was still selling well, and Yinyue still held its original price. Wucai Xing, Bama, Shiquan, and others also fell by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan from the previous day's market. The trend was still fragile.

### China Textile's Allocation of Printed Cotton Cloth, Will Replace New Number Certificates

Customers allocated printed cotton cloth by the China Textile Company must all re-register from the New Year. It is learned that the company is scheduled to open goods with the newly registered number from the 15th of this month. Customers who have not re-registered must re-register before the 15th to receive the new registration number. The old registration number will be completely invalidated from the 15th.

### Yarn, Cloth, and Miscellaneous Grains Transported to Taiwan, American Timber Arrives in Shanghai

[Our report] The China Merchants Bureau's Haiqian ship left Shanghai for Keelung yesterday, loading more than 2,030 bags of beans, more than 7,000 pieces of bean cakes, more than 780 pieces of textiles, 170 pieces of cotton yarn, and 97 pieces of cotton.

Also, the Feier Yeweilan (transliteration), managed by the Fulai Company, arrived in Shanghai from Colombo yesterday afternoon, transporting 5 million feet of raw materials. It berthed at pontoons 14 and 15 for unloading.

### Jianghai Customs Strengthens Anti-Smuggling, Plans Comprehensively for Sea, Land, and Air

Regarding smuggling in this city, according to Jianghai Customs: Although the customs has stationed personnel and anti-smuggling vessels at Wusongkou for strict patrols, it is indeed impossible to inspect the import of warships. The customs has recently paid special attention to these warships. If luggage and articles cannot be inspected on warships, the customs can inspect them after they are unloaded on the wharf. The customs is also paying full attention to aircraft smuggling and is determined to eliminate this smuggling situation. As for the recent abundance of American goods on the market, it is said that they may be goods that were previously stockpiled.

### China Trust's Allocation Postponed, Rayon Rose Sharply Again Yesterday

The market price of rayon was first stable and then high yesterday. No. 120 Takayama Yukari opened at more than 3.1 million yuan. Later, due to the postponement of the 18th allocation of rayon by the Central Trust Bureau due to incomplete audit work, the news spread to the market, and people took the opportunity to raise prices. Asking prices rose sharply. By noon, it was 350,000 yuan, and it rose another 50,000 yuan in the afternoon. The smallest price was about 300,000 yuan higher than the previous night. Other semi-gloss goods had no transactions, but asking prices were also brought up by more than 100,000 yuan. The factory's economic situation was calm, and ordinary five-load open goods were quoted at 4.55 million yuan yesterday. A few loads of dry goods were also traded in retail, with prices at 3.12 million and 170,000 yuan. There was little difference between the silk market and the previous day. Meea quilt fabrics were at 2.65 million yuan. Huajin crepe was 400 yuan in the morning. Because the raw materials increased in the afternoon, the asking price also increased by 100 yuan.

### Overcoat Fabrics Fall Frequently

The trend of overcoat fabrics on the public tea party these days is weaker than that of any other product. Retail sellers are constantly calling out lower prices, while buyers are less interested, and the market is falling more. Because the date of sale is already late, once they are put aside, they must wait for half a year. Both parties' discount rates are related.

### Fancy Woolens Flourish

Various fancy woolens that may be sold in the spring, whether suit materials or ordinary goods, and those made of fine wool, have all been rising in recent days, both from incoming routes and from local factories. Due to the difficulty in placing orders, the prices of wool fabrics have been stable or falling for more than two months. Stores with substantial financial strength have been secretly buying, and factory prices have been raised one after another. Distant customers have also been making inquiries.

### Taiwan Sugar Distributes Early

### Temporary End to Yarn Allocation; Cotton Yarn Returns to Free Trade

The final allocation of cotton yarn for the fourth period, conducted by the six district textile guilds, was completed yesterday, the 6th. It was also decided that yarn allocation work would not continue after this and would be temporarily suspended. As for the issue of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee purchasing half of the cotton yarn production from various yarn factories in the city, and the handling of these purchases, detailed measures are still being drafted. These measures will need to be voted on in meetings, which will take time. During this transitional period, yarn allocation has been suspended, and new measures have not yet been implemented. However, the cotton yarn needed for various industries cannot be stopped. Regarding how to handle this, the six district guilds previously sought instructions from the Cotton Yarn Control Committee. The Committee submitted the issue to the first yarn price review committee meeting of the year, which decided that in the future, various industries could freely purchase the yarn and cloth they needed from textile factories. As for the price, it should be based on the adjusted prices of the last distribution of the fourth period, allowing buyers and sellers to freely negotiate, but the market price should not deviate too far from the adjusted price.

### Oil Cake Business Tax; Ministry of Finance Refuses Exemption

Last year, the Grain and Oil Cake Business Association submitted a document to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that business tax be exempted for oil cakes made from beans, citing previous examples. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce then telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on their behalf. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Finance has replied, stating that the regulations for exempting grain businesses from business tax are limited to rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and flours made from them that can serve as staple foods. Bean oil is only a non-staple food, and the raw materials have already been processed. Bean cake is used for fertilizing farmland and is not food, so it cannot be included in the scope of the grain business. The request for business tax exemption cannot be approved. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already replied to the Grain Business Association.

### Tinplate Stability

After the New Year, steel plate prices rose again from 1.7 million to 2 million. It is said that recent arrivals have stabilized the market. The price of 26-gauge tinplate continues to rise. 24-gauge is extremely scarce. Double and small tinplate prices remain stable. This is because tinplate imports are scarce, while the demand for can manufacturing and yarn factory rollers is great, so the market situation is difficult to stabilize.

### London Reveals News; Optimistic Outlook for Sino-British Trade

[Reuters, London, 6th] Although the opinions brought back by the British trade mission have not yet been revealed, they are believed to be very significant. According to well-informed sources, the word "long-term" can barely express even a fraction of it, because short-term possibilities are limited by the chaos within China and the severe shortage still afflicting Britain. Apart from these current difficulties, the general view is that the future is extremely optimistic. Although Britain is unable to lend China or anyone else $500 million in US dollars (the US Export-Import Bank has allocated that amount to lend to China, implementing President Truman's "unified" policy statement of December 15, 1945), Britain still has enormous capacity to engage in trade with China, and what China hopes for is undoubtedly reciprocal trade.

### New York Silver Prices Fall Again; Rumored to Be Due to Large Exchange

Another message: The leading gold and silver broker Handy & Harman's New York silver listing today was 82 and 1/3 US cents per ounce, down 1 cent from Saturday's price.

### Only Exporters and Importers Hold Seminar

### Temporary Management Committee for Imported Goods; Handles Business Registration; Relaxes Deadline for Import Permits

The temporary management committee for imported goods is handling the registration of businesses dealing with imported goods. As of yesterday, 400 units have been registered. The committee is currently conducting review and investigation work. The first step of this work is to request each bank in the city to report the foreign exchange settlement situation of each business with the bank, and then separately investigate the past trade situation of each business. Currently, 80% of the banks' reports have been sent to the committee. It is expected that the entire review can be completed this month. Businesses that are not approved will not be allowed to operate in the future. The detailed allocation of imported goods to approved businesses will be executed by the industry association entrusted by the committee.

The person in charge of the Import Management Committee told reporters yesterday that the import and export trade regulations stipulate that the second category of imported goods listed in the appendix must be imported with quotas. The quota allocation office of the committee formulates the total annual import volume based on domestic needs, and then approves import permits. Since these goods are mostly industrial raw materials or necessities for people's livelihood, the committee has decided to be flexible before the import quota is formulated, and issue import permits in advance, allowing imports. Once the total import volume is stipulated, it will be deducted from the quota. At the same time, the validity period of the permits issued by the committee in November and December of last year was originally scheduled to end at the end of February of this year. Because overseas orders may not be shipped and imported as scheduled, the deadline has been extended by one month to the end of March. The validity period of the permits issued this month is stipulated to be the end of April.

### Social Affairs Bureau Regularly; Popular Sales of Discounted Coal Balls

Recently, the weather has turned cold, and the Spring Festival is approaching, and the demand for fuel for the general public is even more urgent. The black market price of coal balls has risen from 10,000 yuan per load to 25,000 yuan. In order to eliminate this speculation, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to widely sell discounted coal balls on the 10th of this month (Friday), with the price set at 220,000 yuan per ton, calculated pro rata for retail sales. The current process is for the Fuel Management Committee to transport the allocated white coal scrap to the coal ball factory on the 6th, make it into coal balls, and then distribute it to retailers for widespread sales to suppress the black market for coal balls. It has been decided to convene a meeting of the coal price review committee's coal ball subgroup today (Wednesday) to discuss the general sales methods. Retailer representatives will submit a roster to the joint office. The office currently has 1,100 members. After the Social Affairs Bureau registers and numbers the addresses and distribution quantities of each coal ball store, it will notify the public to purchase nearby. In principle, there will be no limit on purchases for the time being, but it is necessary to queue in order. On the 9th, each retailer will pick up goods from the coal ball factory in their respective districts. The 10th will be the day for the general sale of discounted coal balls. The total amount of coal balls this time is 100,000 tons. Currently, the Fuel Management Committee has allocated 6,000 tons of white coal scrap, so the quantity to be sold continuously from the 10th will be 12,000 tons.

### Fine Silk Machines Cannot Spin Coarse Yarn; Fire Machine Cotton Prospects Dim

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a cotton spinning industry source, the fire machine cotton produced in counties near Shanghai, especially in Taicang, is of relatively pure quality. However, most of it is only suitable for spinning 10-count and 12-count cotton yarn, and only a few can spin 16-count yarn. However, the consumption standard for cotton yarn has progressed from the coarse-count yarn era to the fine-count yarn era. Therefore, most yarn factory products are now 20-count yarn or higher. And the textile machines in various yarn factories are mostly equipped for spinning fine yarn. Therefore, the amount of raw cotton required for coarse-count yarn has decreased. According to statistics, among the 36 yarn factories participating in the joint distribution of cotton yarn in the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, the amount of raw cotton required for spinning coarse yarn each year is about 100,000 dan. Even for the China Textile Construction Company, most of its textile machines are equipped for fine yarn. Therefore, the amount of raw cotton required for spinning coarse yarn each year is only 20,000 dan. If we want each yarn factory to purchase and spin coarse yarn for the sake of the fire machine cotton's outlet, then spinning coarse yarn with fine yarn machines, although not impossible, will result in each spindle not being able to operate at full capacity, and the production results of each yarn factory will suffer even greater losses. Therefore, the source said: The current situation of fire machine cotton is a tragedy produced by the progress of the times. The fundamental solution is to start by improving cotton varieties, which can be effective. However, this cannot be achieved overnight and will require a considerable amount of time to gradually improve the quality of varieties.

[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Because the national schools in various Mongolian leagues and banners and the education department have had little close contact, the subsidy for the restoration funds of the league and banner schools, except for those schools that have already been restored and reported to the Ministry of Education on record, can be directly distributed, while those transferred by the education department take time, and the schools feel very inconvenient.

Nantong's center, Wang Huaiding, was formerly a veteran of Renyu, but yesterday, in the chaotic game, he felt like "a hero with no place to use his talents." The second game was in the women's group, between Jiaotong University and Daxia, refereed by Zhu Mingxing. Jiaotong forfeited the previous game to College of Physical Education. Yesterday, Chen Ling personally led the female players to battle, and they were indeed extraordinary, defeating Daxia soundly. The final game was also in the women's group, between the College of Law and College of Physical Education, refereed by Zhang Jufei. The two sides were evenly matched. In the first half, the College of Law led by a narrow margin of 13-12. However, in the second half, the College of Physical Education's guards tightly marked the College of Law's top scorer, You Decui, and ultimately secured the final victory. The game summaries and results are as follows:

Nantong College Defeats Tongde for the First Time

The first game was in the college group, between Tongde and Nantong. Tongde's Song Huanzhang opened the scoring with a long shot. Nantong's Wang Huaiding was effective on both offense and defense. Lu Tong and Gao Bingming added to the score, and Nantong steadily took the lead, finishing the first quarter with a 12-5 advantage. In the second quarter, Tongde's Chen Youmin suddenly rallied, scoring nine points with three throws and two free throws. At halftime, Tongde trailed by one and a half points, with a score of 14-17. In the third quarter, both sides engaged in a chaotic battle, each making some gains. In the final quarter, Nantong's Wang Huaiding had great luck with his shots, scoring ten points himself, resulting in a 39-27 victory over Tongde.

Jiaotong University Women Defeat Daxia

The second game was in the women's group, between Daxia and Jiaotong University. Daxia's Chen Xiujing scored the first point with a free throw, followed by Cai Guoying who also scored with a free throw. However, at halftime, they were still far behind, with a score of 4-11. In the third quarter, Jiaotong's Lu Zhaoshan was extremely accurate with her shots, scoring on every attempt, resulting in an absolute advantage of 24-7. In the end, Daxia suffered a crushing defeat of 8-31 against Jiaotong University.

College of Physical Education Women's Team Defeats College of Law

The final game was also in the women's group, between College of Physical Education and College of Law. College of Physical Education's Liu Meilin scored the first point with a free throw. College of Law's You Decui scored on a throw and then another shot. College of Physical Education's captain, Mei Zutong, hastily seized the opportunity and scored two goals, giving College of Physical Education a 5-4 lead in the first quarter. In the second quarter, College of Physical Education's Li Huifang and College of Law's You Decui traded scores, earning applause from the audience. At halftime, College of Law took the lead with a score of 13-12. Switching sides to play again, both teams had tight defenses. College of Law's You Decui, being larger in stature, had no way to deal with College of Physical Education's strong guards. Both sides scored very few points, and the score was tied twice at 14 and 19. At the start of the final quarter, College of Physical Education's captain, Mei Zutong, frowned and scored repeatedly, securing the final victory of 29-22, defeating the College of Law.

### Random Talks About the New Peking University: The Beach Has Changed (Part 2)

— Cheng Jingyu

Originally, there were dozens of restaurants from various provinces around Mashen Temple. Back then, many students boarded there. There was braised crucian carp from Jiangsu, and Hunan-style chili chicken, as well as the famous Mr. Zhang's tofu. Now, there are only three or four newly opened simple restaurants with no special flavor.

Mashen Temple Restaurants: Erased the Old Habit of Billing

I remember that the old man in charge of accounting at the Zhongshan Canteen always liked to bring up old accounts. Whenever he couldn't collect debts from students, he would grumble, "It doesn't matter, Chen Gongbo still owes me a lot of money. He is now the Minister of Industry, but I haven't asked him for it." I remember the pair of old copper-framed reading glasses that the old man wore. Now even their shadow is gone. How would he have imagined that Chen Gongbo, who owed him meal money, has accumulated so much debt in recent years that he paid it off with his life, repaying the heavy debt he owed to the Chinese nation?

The restaurants now all take cash, and I've never heard of billing. Before the July 7th Incident, you could deposit five yuan and eat more than ten yuan without settling the account. Even during the summer vacation, if there was no way, the owner would often wait until autumn to settle the account. But now everyone is poor. In the past, there were rich students who could help out, and poor students could owe money for food to get by. But now, the money has changed, the social economy is ruined, and even the owners of the newly opened restaurants have no way to maintain the old traditions.

The Old Gatekeeper of the Red Building: Talking Freely About the Past

The Red Building had been the headquarters of the Japanese Military Police for eight years. No one knows how many men and women were killed in the basement. People in Beiping even said that there was a machine grinder inside, specifically for grinding people. After the university recovered the building, many rooms below are still closed. Everyone says that men and women cry inside at midnight. Old Yang, the gatekeeper of the Red Building, has experienced decades of strange changes. Dynasties have changed several times. Now, all of his teeth have fallen out, and his face has many wrinkles. However, he is still happy to talk about the past in front of people: how Liu Zhe scolded students, how Zhang Baixi (in the winter of 1901, the 27th year of Guangxu, an imperial decree was issued to revive the university, and Zhang Baixi was appointed as the Minister of Management) revived the university, how Principal Cai went to Europe that year, how Jiang Menglin came to be the acting principal, and how young Principal Hu was when he first came as a professor. He can recite all of this like a treasure. Especially for those who became famous after entering Peking University, he naturally watched them grow up, so he would naturally call them by their first names: "Fu Sinian, Gu Jiegang, Tao Xisheng, and Lao Gan of the Central Academy now, didn't they all come from here? The first female teacher was Chen Hengzhe. I haven't seen her for many years. Now there are so many female students and several female teachers, it's not uncommon. I remember the first time there was a female student, Old Master Gu (i.e., Gu Hongming) was so scared that he asked where the 'tangke' (a term for a woman) came from. Chen Duxiu, who was the Dean of the Faculty of Arts here in the early years of the Republic of China, also died a few years ago, I heard. Alas! Time really flies! I'm not going to make it either..." He sighed, and the wrinkles on his forehead became more visible, each line recording the history of Peking University. Then he said, "Zhou Zuoren was reportedly sentenced to fourteen years, but why was Qian Daosun only sentenced to ten years? He took so much, he was always colluding with the Japanese, needless to say..."

The beach has changed, Beiping is also poor, and everyone only has a few worthless pieces of paper money. Now even the students don't buy the hundred-yuan newspapers anymore. The newspaper boys are still standing in front of the Red Building in the afternoon, shouting: "A hundred yuan for two of them! Buy a big newspaper for a hundred yuan! Buy one..." The cold wind, like a sharp blade, cut off their listless calls, losing much of their previous charm. The beach has become ordinary.

### Current State of Sports in Taiwan: Interview with Secretary-General Lin of the Taiwan Provincial Sports Association

[Report from our newspaper] Since Taiwan's recovery, everything has been actively engaged in transformation and construction, and no effort has been spared in the field of sports. However, during the period of occupation, the general youth were influenced by the Japanese spirit of Bushido, which caused sports to have an aggressive character. Mr. Lin Chaoquan, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Sports Association, came to Shanghai a few days ago to observe and to negotiate sports equipment matters. Because the sports venues and other facilities in various parts of Taiwan are very complete, what is most lacking after the recovery is sports equipment, so he hopes that sports equipment companies in Shanghai will provide more assistance.

Sports Activities

Mr. Lin is staying at 178 Lane C3, Hartung Road. Yesterday morning, a reporter visited him and talked about the current state of sports in Taiwan. Mr. Lin said that baseball, swimming, track and field, and rugby are the most popular sports in Taiwan, and they may show their skills in the 7th National Games next year. Football and basketball are relatively weaker, but the youth in the province are physically strong and active, and can easily reach high standards with training.

Sportsmanship

In short, the sports atmosphere in Taiwan is very strong, and the only thing lacking is the spirit. Therefore, he hopes that sports groups in the mainland will visit Taiwan in the role of older brothers and give them some new understanding. He said that he had recently discussed with the person in charge of the Jingwu Athletic Association, hoping that the association's boxing class would go to Taiwan. Because during the occupation, there were boxing matches in Taiwan against Japan and the Philippines, and the level was also quite high, so he very much hopes to learn from each other and make progress. In addition, he also hopes to promote the national martial arts with a national consciousness to replace Japanese Bushido, but there is a great lack of national martial arts teachers in the area, and he sincerely hopes that national martial arts masters in the mainland will go there to promote it.

Sports News

Talking about sports news, there are many newspapers in Taiwan, but there are no sports reports, because the reporters there have very poor Chinese language skills, and reporters from the mainland are not good at this type of reporting. He said that Mr. Lin Zongxian, a member of the Senate and a consultant of the association, will be the editor of the Sino-Foreign Daily, which is scheduled to be published in early February. The content will focus on sports, and he hopes to exchange it with newspapers in the mainland and provide assistance.

### College Sports Teachers Association to be Established Today

The Preparatory Committee of the Sports Teachers Association of Colleges and Universities in this city decided through a meeting to publicly elect Jin Zhaojun, Shen Kunnan, Shi Zhiqian, Wu Zibin, Zhang Jufei, Bao Heqing, and Liu Hesheng to draft the association's charter and actively prepare for it. It is reported that the association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Deda Hotel at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road at 6:00 PM this evening. Wu, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Gu and Li, the Directors of the Education Bureau, Wu, the President of Jiaotong University, Ou, the President of Daxia University, and Shao Kexian, Jiang Xiangqing and others from the sports community will be invited to attend and provide guidance. A preparatory committee meeting will be held at 4:00 PM beforehand, and a grand occasion is expected at that time.

### This Year's Household Administration Supervision Implementation Measures: National Universal Implementation of Household Registration

The Municipal Government has approved the telegram from the Ministry of Interior stating that the year 36 of the Republic is the year for the universal implementation of household registration, which was listed as the central task of the year by the President's handwritten order. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to achieve the schedule without strengthening supervision and assessment. Moreover, the national area is vast, so this method must be adopted. There are a total of 19 articles, which are formulated based on the Ministry of Interior's work plan for the 36th year of the Republic.

The central tasks for supervising household administration in the 36th year of the Republic are as follows: (1) Supervise various recovered areas to complete household registration; (2) Supervise areas with household registration to organize according to law; (3) Supervise areas without household registration to universally implement it; (4) Supervise areas with household registration to produce and issue national identification cards; (5) Supervise areas with household registration to transcribe the roster of able-bodied men and the national soldier roster; (6) Supervise areas with household registration to compile various household statistics tables.

### Brief News from Famous Districts

The People's Representative Assembly of the 17th District (North Sichuan Road) held its second meeting on the 5th at Qingyun Elementary School on Qingyun Road. Luo Zhongxian, the ward chief of the 18th ward of the 26th District (Caojing), and Qin Wenzhun, the ward chief of the 11th ward, resigned from their positions as ward chiefs and were temporarily replaced by Shen Hongxi, the deputy ward chief assigned by the district.

Xu Wenzhao of the first ward, Sun Lanting of the 26th ward, Zhu Zhenting of the 27th ward, and Lu Ping of the 31st ward, who were part-time people's representatives of the second district (Laozha), have successively resigned from their positions as district people's representatives to take up full-time positions as ward chiefs and deputy ward chiefs. The vacancies were filled by alternate representatives Wang Yonghua, Ye Wengao, Sun Xueni, and He Hongde from each of those wards.

Li Peisheng, the ward chief of the 21st ward, and Lin Fankang, the ward chief of the 40th ward, who were part-time people's representatives of the 12th district (Jiangning), have successively resigned from their positions as district people's representatives to take up full-time positions as ward chiefs. The vacancies were filled by alternate representatives Ying Hongnian and Chen Weishan from each of those wards.

### Amidst the Flames of Civil War: Raising a Serious Real-World Issue

— Airmal from December 28th, Our Jinan Correspondent, Li Tian

Unless the Kuomintang and the Communist Party truly reconcile and cooperate, and the military becomes nationalized, the future trajectory of the civil war may see Shandong become a second Jiangxi after the Northern Expedition and before the War of Resistance, due to factors such as its terrain, resources, culture, and history. It will be the Communist army's strongest and also its last base. In the overall civil war situation, the gain or loss of Shandong is of decisive importance.

At the same time, it must be stated: The reporter writes this article not to propagandize or promote "anti-communism," but only to objectively analyze the possible future trends of the civil war, so as to help readers gain a deeper understanding of the domestic war situation.

Three Perspectives

When it comes to the domestic war, based on what this reporter has gleaned from Chinese and foreign generals, the views can be summarized into the following three categories: (1) Under the mediation of Marshall, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will eventually achieve peaceful cooperation, work together wholeheartedly to build a unified, democratic, prosperous, strong, and happy new China; (2) The Communist army will eventually be eliminated or disintegrated by the National army; (3) Although the war may ebb and flow, or the main force of the Communist army may be largely eliminated by the National army, it will not fundamentally and thoroughly annihilate the Communist army. The war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will only continue until a final reckoning after the outbreak of the Third World War.

Regarding the first view, those familiar with internal affairs mostly believe that it is, if not "fantasy," at least a "miracle." Regarding the second view, it depends on whether the government strives for progress in political affairs and whether its strategic application is thorough and appropriate. Regarding the third and final view, most people believe that it is the most likely outcome, but if we are truly forced to go down this road, our 400 million Chinese people will also encounter a fate that is difficult to fathom.

Strategic Importance

In the eyes of military observers, since the first possibility is considered almost a miracle, then whether the future domestic war takes the second or third path, Shandong's position in the domestic war situation deserves full recognition. In terms of military geography, Shandong is not only located in the center of the country, but the Shandong Peninsula extends deep into the sea, forming a strategic corner with the Liaodong Peninsula, with only a short voyage separating them. Therefore, Shandong is not only the lifeline of North China but also the only base for controlling the nine northeastern provinces. There is a reason and basis for the geographic expert Weng Wenhao's singular advocacy of establishing the capital in Jinan.

In addition to geographical factors, in terms of resources, Shandong's soybean production is second only to the Northeast in the country, cotton production is second only to Shaanxi, and wheat, rice, and miscellaneous grains are sufficient for the entire province's population with surplus. Underground resources such as coal and iron also rank third or fourth in the country. In terms of culture, "Yan and Zhao have many generous and tragic heroes." Shandong people have always been known for their hard work, resilience, heroism, integrity, trustworthiness, and righteousness, and they are physically strong and tall. As generals, they are often good generals, and as soldiers, they are good soldiers. Among the 38 million people, at least 5 million of the most outstanding soldiers can be produced. Even shallow and incompetent people like Liu Zhennian and Han Fuqu were able to occupy Shandong for so long, so the inherent advantages of Shandong itself can be imagined!

Furthermore, analyzing the history of the Communist army in Shandong and the advantages and disadvantages of their major bases in the country: Although northern Shaanxi is the heart of the Communist army, with the longest operation and the strongest military force, it is difficult for the Communist army to defend for a long time because of the poor land and people and being surrounded by enemies on all sides. The area north of the Songhua River in the Northeast, although easy to obtain foreign aid due to its remote location, has little effect on the overall domestic situation due to its overly peripheral location. In addition, since the base was only established after the victory of the War of Resistance, the time was short, and the foundation was not solid, it is also easy for the National army to attack and destroy it early. Other areas such as the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, the Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, and the northern Jiangsu Military Region are all strategically located in areas surrounded by enemies on all sides, and it is not difficult to pacify them. Only the Shandong Military Region is located in the heart of China. The Shandong Peninsula extends deep into the sea, and the Yimeng Mountains and Laoshan Mountains are continuous and undulating, with complex terrain. The Communist army claims to have operated for eight years, with deep-rooted foundations. In addition, Yantai and Longkou are only a waterway away from Lushun and Dalian, making it easy to obtain foreign aid. Therefore, Shandong has become the Communist army's most superior and potentially longest-held base, and Shandong's gain or loss has a decisive role in the overall domestic war situation.

Confrontational Situation

Shandong has a total of 107 counties, three ordinary cities, and one special municipality. As of the time this reporter is writing this article, 34 counties and one ordinary city (Jinan) and one special municipality (Qingdao) are completely in the hands of the National army. The remaining 15 counties are divided between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The area controlled by the government, in addition to the 14 counties in southern Shandong, is the 30-kilometer corridor along both sides of the Jiaoji Railway. The corridor area is naturally a vital area of concern for the Communist army. Therefore, in this day when it claims to have operated for eight years, possessing 1.2 million militiamen and 400,000 regular troops, it is still cautious and repeatedly expanding its army. Recently, it has expanded two more divisions. All men aged 16 to 50 and women aged 16 to 40 are being forcibly conscripted, which shows that the attempt to consolidate is not small.

At present, the government army is subject to the ceasefire order, and is in a passive position militarily everywhere, while the Communist army is deploying troops and generals, accumulating grass and storing grain, and carrying out deployments to attack the corridor area along the Jiaoji Line. The war in Shandong is expected to become fierce again with the arrival of the new year!

Where to Go

Regardless of how busy the Communist army is currently making deployments to attack the Jiaoji corridor in Shandong, Liu Bocheng, the highest commander of the Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, has moved to Dezhou, and Chen Yi, the commander of the New Fourth Army and the highest person in charge of the Shandong Military Region, has fled back from northern Jiangsu to Linyi (the highest command tower of the Shandong "Liberated Area"). In short, the Communist army's objective strength and potential are another matter, and its subjective demand is to hope to use Shandong as its strongest base to wait for favorable opportunities and situations to arrive.

Looking at the overall situation, when the remaining Communist army in northern Jiangsu is unable to gain a foothold, its largest rear base is Shandong. In the future, when the Communist army in the Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, the Ji-Cha Border Region, the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Region, the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, and even southern Northeast is unable to exist in their respective bases, they will all flee to Shandong and use Shandong as their last and largest base. At present, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu and the Ji-Lu-Yu area have begun to flow in this direction. In this way, will Shandong not become a second Jiangxi after the success of the Northern Expedition and before the rise of the War of Resistance?

The facts are before us: Shandong must be defended by the Communist army. If the government is forced to solve the domestic problem by force, should it first use its greatest strength to "attack what must be defended" and first solve the Communist army in Shandong? Or should it nurture a hidden danger and allow the Communist army to become strong in Shandong and truly evolve into a situation far more serious than Jiangxi? This question is related to the future of the country, and the burden falls on the shoulders of Chairman Wang Yaowu, a burden far heavier than that borne by General Fu Zuoyi in the past.

### Thousands of Miles Along the Huai and Si Rivers

— Report from January 5th, Zhu Zhensheng

Between the Huai and Si Rivers and the Xuzhou and Haizhou areas, above the ancient Pei, Xiao, and Dang, from afar, like Han Gaozu rising from Feng and Pei, and Xiang Yu's ancestral home being in Suqian, and Han Xin growing up on the banks of the Huai River; closer, like Gu Zhutong and Han Deqin coming from Lianshui and Siyang; and Wang Maogong, Wang Jingjiu, and Wang Zhonglian being born in Xiao and Dang, they were either founding wise emperors and holy rulers, or loyal ministers and good generals who stabilized the country. However, in the Southern Song Dynasty and the late Qing Dynasty, Gao and Bao of the Jianghuai region first suffered the rebellion of Li Quan, a miscellaneous barbarian, and then the rebellion of Hong and Yang in the Su, Song, Chang, and Tai regions, causing the people to suffer and have no means of livelihood. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Jiangsu was the first to be invaded, with livestock being slaughtered and homes destroyed, and pillaging and burning being rampant. For nine years, it has suffered even more from the trampling of enemy and puppet forces. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, it was disturbed by the Communist Party and trapped in war, leaving the common people with no chance to catch their breath, and turning Jiangsu, known as a region of culture and civilization, into a hell on earth for a long time. The author participated in the war for eight years and has not set foot in northern Jiangsu for ten years. Recently, I accompanied Chairman Wang on a trip to the east, traversing eight counties and traveling thousands of miles, inspecting the Huai and Si areas. I will now write down what I have seen and heard:

On the Huaiyang Road

In a dawn when the morning stars were few and the cold dew was congealing into frost, I accompanied Chairman Wang and seven or eight senior officials from the provincial government across the Yangtze River from Zhenjiang. Looking around at Jinjiao and Beigu, they stood tall and majestic, and the waves were surging, as the great river flowed eastward. At about seven o'clock, we arrived at Liuwei and boarded three trucks prepared in advance, heading north. The sparse, decaying willows lined both sides, and the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard. After passing the Fairy Temple, there were four or five large bridges, either due to disrepair or damage by the Communist army. Not long ago, a truck full of men, women, old, and young drove to the middle of a bridge, the bridge broke, and the truck fell, with forty-odd people all being drowned, and buried in the bellies of fish. Therefore, all vehicles now passing by must have all passengers disembark, leaving only the empty vehicle to pass, so as to avoid repeating the unfortunate tragedy. Upon entering Gaoyou County at Shaobo, the town was formerly occupied by the Communist army and was contested several times when the National army conquered it. Gaoyou Lake has tens of thousands of acres of waves, with water connecting the sky and the sky meeting the water. On both sides of the canal, sails dotted the landscape, with huts in clusters of three or five. Every few tens of miles along the lake, there is a market town, and small inland river boats have resumed navigation, loading and unloading goods and passengers along the way, the market is quite lively, and the countryside is gradually becoming prosperous. In the Kuomintang-Communist negotiations, in addition to military and political matters, the restoration of transportation is also one of the disputes. If transportation is not restored, then the restoration and construction of the country will all be equal to empty talk and cannot be started. When the car arrived at Gaoyou County, it was learned that Commander Xue Zhongshu of the 90th Brigade was moving his troops here, but unfortunately, due to the haste of the journey, we did not have time to meet. Crossing the boundary at Jieshou and entering Baoying Lake, the lake surface is smaller than Gaoyou Lake, and the car traveled in a winding path beside it. Looking from afar, it seemed like traveling in a water town. Both lakes produce fish and shellfish and are rich in water resources. The fields on all sides are irrigated. However, there are frequent floods, which are not as advantageous as Dongting and Poyang Lakes. At noon, we arrived at the Baoying County government, and learned that the county had received a district chief of the Communist Party's Luyi District, who had been wounded and captured in the second district of the county. Chairman Wang personally went to comfort him, and gave him 50,000 yuan in national currency, and instructed County Magistrate Shen to take good care of him. In addition, he instructed the county government to purchase medals, certificates, and a small number of practical items with 300,000 yuan in national currency to commend and comfort the families of the self-defense team members who died in the county, so that the living would be comforted and the dead would be at peace. Continuing on in the afternoon, the cars rolled on, and the horses neighed. At that time, the battles in Yancheng and Lianshui were in full swing, and military transport was frequent along the way. At dusk, we passed Huai'an, and entered the city of Huaiyin at dusk.

Huaiyin Urban Area

Huaiyin, also known as Qingjiangpu, is located on the Yin side of the Huai River and east of Hongze Lake, bordering Anhui. It was a key transportation route for grain in the past. In the Qing Dynasty, the Office of the Governor-General of Grain Transport was established, and in the early Republic of China, the Salt Commissioner of Lianghuai was established. Fifty years ago, the tall buildings and mansions along the river on the north gate stretched for ten miles. However, since the opening of sea transport and the construction of the Jinpu Railway, it has declined day by day and no longer has its former glory. Huaiyin and Huai'an. In the Han Dynasty, they were both called Huaiyin. Historical sites include Han Xin City, Limumu Tomb, and Luxia Bridge, which are preserved in both cities for later generations to look back on. In the autumn of the past year, the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the Communist army occupied it as the seat of the Su-Wan Border Region Government. Communist military and political figures, such as Li Yimang, chairman of the border region government, and Chen Yi, commander of the New Fourth Army, were stationed in Huai for a long time. On September 13th last year, Lieutenant General Zhang Lingfu of the 74th Reorganized Division, while attacking Siyang with the 7th Army, personally led the 51st, 57th, and 58th Brigades, dividing them into two columns, braving the rain to forcefully cross the old Yellow River. They studied and defeated the 9th Column's 2nd Division Pi Brigade and the Special Service Regiment Cavalry Regiment Guard Battalion, etc., commanded by the Communist army Chen Qingxian, numbering about 20,000. They then besieged the 5th Column and the 1st Division and 4th Division of the New 6th Army, which were reinforcing Huaiyin. On the 18th, Yang Jin, battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 172nd Regiment of our 58th Brigade, was the first to rush into the South Gate and joined up with the two companies that had broken in earlier. Although the Communist army executed three regimental commanders who had lost the battle during the fighting to encourage morale, they were still unable to reverse the decline. After seven days of bloody fighting and nine attacks, although our battalion commanders Liu Puyou and Zhu Xinglun heroically sacrificed their lives, Huaiyin was finally completely recovered by our National army at 2 p.m. on the 20th. 2,202 Communist soldiers were captured, and more than 10,000 were killed or wounded. 2,886 light and heavy machine guns and 69 large and small artillery pieces were seized. The main force of the Communist army was damaged and its vitality was greatly injured. Now, the Su-Wan Border Region Government has been used by us as the temporary office of the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Huaiyin, and the place where the Communist Party arranged to receive the Huaiyin Executive Group has also been temporarily used as the command post of Xu Zhou Pacification Headquarters Deputy Director Li Jifu - General Yannian. Other places such as the park, Xinhua Daily, and the National Assembly Hall have been rebuilt and transformed, but traces of the Communist Party can still be found. Before the war, the county of Huaiyin had a population of 700,000 to 800,000, and most of them have returned. Under the efforts of County Magistrate Huang Jiaju, county administration has gradually returned to normal. However, due to its strategic location, a curfew is imposed after 8 p.m., and the vigilance is strict, with the image of a tense wartime still present.

What I Saw and Heard in Suqian and Siyang

Once past Huaiyin, trees became sparse, and sandstorms swept across the face, resembling the scenery outside the Great Wall. Stepping into Suqian, the language, diet, habits, and gestures felt like the customs of Qi and Lu. Suqian is the hometown of Xiang Yu. In the past, the Overlord led 8,000 disciples and soldiers, rising in Jiangdong, fighting more than seventy battles, winning every battle and conquering every attack, shaking the four seas with his might. The Consort Yu of the drama "Farewell My Concubine" was from Wuji, Shuyang, his neighboring county. Heroes and beauties, even after thousands of years, are still praised by people. There are many stockades in northern Jiangsu, built with earth and surrounded by deep trenches, resembling earthen cities. Although the city of Suqian is not very majestic, the earthen city is quite strong. And General Wu Weisheng - Qiwei, Deputy Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, is stationed there to supervise the troops and block the Communist army's escape route. The streets are wide, the houses are neat, and the surface is still quite lively. However, it is said that after the Communist army's "struggles", the residents of the city and countryside are left with only the clothes on their backs, and five, six, seven, or eight people share a quilt. Siyang was ravaged by the enemy and puppet forces for nine years and destroyed several times by the Communist Party. The old city is a pile of rubble and has completely disappeared. Now the military and political organs and shops in Siyang have moved to Zhongxing Town. Chairman Wang has shown the administrative guidelines to the commissioners and county magistrates in Yang Zhou, Gao You, and Bao Ying. In Huaiyin, Suqian, and Siyang, he and Commissioner Yu Yuzhi of the 7th District separately convened responsible persons from various organs and local gentry and scholars to listen to reports and review county administration. He instructed officials at all levels that all administration should be based on what the people like and what the people hate, to cooperate with the military, to quickly restore order, and to ensure security. At the same time, he organized agricultural loans and industrial and commercial loans, promoted production, revived the countryside, and created schools to cultivate talents. What is taken from the people must be used for the people. At the same time, he encouraged the people of northern Jiangsu to contribute money if they have money and effort if they have strength, to protect the country and defend their hometowns, to seek long-term peace and stability for the country, and to seek a peaceful and prosperous life for themselves. Land policy should also be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central government, and in particular, extortion and blackmail should be avoided under the pretext of self-renewal and surrender of the Communist Party. He repeatedly exhorted, and his words were earnest and sincere. Chairman Wang is from Jiangsu. Although he is 56 years old, he is still vigorous and works diligently and loves the people, making us young people feel quite ashamed in addition to admiration!

Four Days in Yangtai

Throughout the newly recovered counties in northern Jiangsu, financial difficulties and tight administrative expenses are a common phenomenon. Economy is the mother of all administrations. If revenue and expenditure are insufficient, all matters that should be promoted and reformed cannot be carried out. However, governance lies in people. Counties, districts, townships, and bao are the grassroots of administration, but financial resources and talent are difficult to obtain, just like money. A large number of learned and talented people are concentrated in a small number of cities, while the vast countryside lacks talent and cadres. We must correct this top-heavy political malaise. Talent should be distributed to the countryside, to the fields! Yangtai is a city that has not been invaded by the Communist army. We stopped there briefly. We traveled to famous sites such as the clothes and crown tomb of Shi Kefa, the Ping Shan Tang, and Slender West Lake along with Director Wang Zuohua of the 4th Reorganized Division and Vice Director Rong Youlue. I was moved by the fact that at the end of the Chongzhen period, the rebel bandits Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng invaded the capital, and Wu Sangui brought in the Qing soldiers. Minister Shi was able to defend Yangzhou with his life as a lone minister at the end of the Ming Dynasty. "A few plum blossoms are tears for the fallen country, and the bright moon reflects the heart of a former minister." He could not be subdued by force, could not be corrupted by wealth, and committed suicide with the fall of the country, achieving immortality along with Zhang Suiyang and Wen Tianxiang. As for the so-called Twenty-Four Bridges, the scenery of the setting sun on the rolling grass and the prosperity of the Sui and Tang Dynasties can no longer be found. In the past, when the 83rd Reorganized Division was stationed in Taizhou, it was fiercely besieged by the Communist army, but fortunately, Director Li Tianxia bravely repelled them. Now, Major Generals Liang Bo and Chen Zhen of the 102nd Brigade are responsible for the city defense, and the security of the city is very peaceful. I once went on a trip to Jiangyan, a county rich in grain and rice, with Regiment Commander Chen Hongzhao and others. The canal was full of rice boats, the market was prosperous, and rice was only sold for more than 30,000 yuan per stone, and pork only cost 1,450 yuan per catty. The cost of living was several times lower than that of Shanghai, and it used to be the Communist army's granary in northern Jiangsu. Taixian has a reformatory that has collected nearly a thousand Communist prisoners. When Magistrate Ding accompanied us to visit, these prisoners were well-fed and warmly dressed, and they were doing exercises, living a very stable life. Some of the prisoners were being treated in the health center due to injuries. One prisoner, about 20 years old, said, "I was dragged away by the Communist army to serve as a stretcher bearer, and later I was transferred to be a soldier. The Communist army called the National army reactionaries, and their officials called instructors, and the soldiers called combatants. The soldiers' monthly salary was two catties of pork, and the company commander received an additional one and a half catties of pork. When fighting the National army, they had to flee east and west several times a day. His own parents did not know that he was forced to be a soldier, let alone that his son would be injured and lying on a hospital bed. He hoped that when he recovered from his injuries, he would be able to return to his hometown and see his parents again." Who has no parents? Who has no children? Driving innocent people into the fire of war and celebrating liberation and singing democracy, how can they justify themselves? The country has undergone eight years of war, creating great pain and trauma. We must strive for recovery and education, work hard to revitalize, and bury ourselves in construction. The melons of Huangtai cannot be picked again! How can we allow brothers to fight each other, and the heron and the clam to fight, plunging the country and the nation into an irreparable situation? Even if the Communist Party does not plan for the country and the nation, they should think about their own descendants. Why must they meet on the battlefield? National affairs can be discussed at length, carefully deliberated, and turned swords into silk, and hostility into peace. We must work together with one heart to seek recovery and build China into a prosperous and happy country.

### Xin Gang (New Harbor) Sluice – A Trial Voyage Record

— Tianjin, 25th (Shipping News). Our Tianjin Correspondent, Li Shaolin

Under conditions of extremely difficult transportation in Jin-Gu (Tianjin area), the completion of the Xin Gang Sluice in Tanggu has opened a new chapter. Although the entire Tanggu Xin Gang project is far from complete, especially far from the ideal plan, the opening of the sluice is already a new achievement at Dagukou, and it is sufficient to provide great convenience for Jin-Gu transportation. From the start of the sluice's operation, the silt bar at the Haihe (Hai River) estuary is no longer an obstacle to navigation for incoming and outgoing vessels. Ships of 3,000 tons and even 10,000 tons can now enter the harbor from outside Dagukou via the 13-kilometer-long Xin Gang channel. Ships under 3,000 tons can also navigate directly to Tianjin via the sluice.

Taking Over – Utter Chaos

The original project authority for the Xin Gang construction was the Tanggu Xin Gang Engineering Office of the Ministry of Communications. It was reorganized this autumn into the Xin Gang Engineering Bureau. When the new port was first taken over, the sluice portion of the project was 80% complete. Extending from both sides of the sluice were the north and south breakwaters. The north breakwater was 12,750 meters long, but only 3,800 meters of the project were complete. The south breakwater was 16,800 meters long, with 5,000 meters completed and 4,500 meters half-completed. Between the two breakwaters was the 13-kilometer-long channel. In the Japanese plan, the section near the sluice was to be dredged to 6 meters below the Dagu zero point, and the section extending outward was to be dredged to 8 meters deep. Before the victory, this channel section had been dredged to 6 meters. Upon takeover, the plans had been burned, and some of the materials had been stolen or scattered, creating a scene of utter chaos.

The Engineering Bureau Completes the Sluice

After the establishment of the Xin Gang Engineering Bureau, the leaders focused on the urgent needs of Jin-Gu and devoted all efforts to completing the sluice. Construction began in October and was declared complete on December 13th. On December 15th, the Xin Gang Engineering Bureau held a trial voyage of the sluice. The reporter was invited to observe, and I felt immense joy in personally witnessing this new transformation of the Haihe estuary at Dagukou. Starting today, I am truly gratified. At 9:00 AM, I departed from Tianjin in the Xin Gang Engineering Bureau's shuttle car. It was a rare good day in the depths of winter. Although the Jin-Tang highway was under construction and the road surface was extremely uneven, causing the car to bump violently, this warm, windless morning gave me a sense of relaxation. Along the way, I saw frozen paddy fields, and some people were fishing from holes in the ice. The glistening ice surface reflected sunlight into my eyes. Village children, wearing large cotton shoes, were happily skating on the ice. From an aesthetic point of view, winter is also lovely. While taking in the endless winter scenery along the way, the two-hour journey to Xin Gang passed quickly.

The New Sluice, Man-Made

After arriving at the sluice, the trial voyage immediately began. The sluice is located on the north side of the Haihe estuary. The upper end of the sluice opens into the Haihe, and the lower end is connected to the entirely man-made 13-kilometer-long channel that extends directly into the sea. The sluice itself is 180 meters long, 21 meters wide, and 9.7 meters high. The bottom of the sluice is 5 meters below the Dagu zero point, with a depth of 5 meters at low tide and up to 8 meters at high tide. Each gate at both ends of the sluice weighs 180 tons and is equipped with air-filled floating boxes, which can reduce the weight by buoyancy to 140 tons. Therefore, the mass in the water is only 40 tons. Opening and closing are done entirely by electricity, taking about two minutes each time. All the machinery was originally ordered from Japan during the enemy puppet regime, but it was never delivered after the victory. The current machinery is temporarily pieced together. The control room is equipped with a 75-horsepower electric motor, although only 40 horsepower is actually needed to open and close the gates. The control panel is located on the north bank of the sluice. Because the machinery was assembled from various sources, the person in charge believed that there might be unreliable operation, so they are still searching for the set of machines originally ordered from Japan, preparing to replace them.

Glimpses of the Whole During the Trial Voyage

We stood on the third-floor platform of the control room to observe this trial voyage. From this vantage point, we could roughly see the entirety of Xin Gang. Looking from the top, the south breakwater on the south side of the gate was clearly visible. South of the breakwater was a vast expanse of water. Just outside the Haihe estuary lay the well-known Dagukou silt bar. The north breakwater was too far away to be seen at all, but the large tract of land artificially leveled on the north side of the channel could be seen very clearly. The first wharf, more than 90% complete, faced the Haihe. The river was full of white ice floes, winding like a white python curled up on the ground. The Jin Xing (Golden Star) test ship was moored in the Haihe outside the gate. At 11:20 AM, the upper gate was opened at the wave of a flag. The Jin Xing was then towed by a small tugboat from the Haihe into the gate. The gate was then closed. With the ship now inside the gate, it waited for the water level inside the gate to be adjusted to the level of the Dagu waterway. After 25 minutes, the lower gate opened, and the Jin Xing, still being pulled by the small tugboat, pushed aside the dense ice floes surrounding it and sailed out to sea. The trial voyage was successfully completed. From this point on, the Haihe and the waters of Dagu were united by this [sluice], beginning a new life.

Channel and Wharf Awaiting Processing

After the trial voyage, we were then led to visit the machine factory and the No. 1 wharf. The machine factory was divided into casting, riveting, fitter, and forging sections. The sluice gates were the masterpiece of this factory. The No. 1 wharf is 700 meters long and can simultaneously accommodate five to seven 3,000-ton ships. However, the depth is not yet ideal, currently only three meters deep, which causes many inconveniences for berthing 3,000-ton ships. During our visit, a dredging ship was working there. The ideal depth is six meters. As for the 13-kilometer-long channel, it had originally been dredged to six meters below the Dagu zero point. However, because the south breakwater has not been completed, silt still drifts in, and the banks of the channel have collapsed. According to measurements, it has been silted up by as much as 1.5 meters in the past year and urgently needs dredging. Repairing the wharves and dredging the channel are the main tasks of the Engineering Bureau in the next three years. The goal of this work is to enable Xin Gang to have a throughput of 2 million to 4 million tons per year. To this end, on the north side of the channel, outside the wharf, preparations are underway to dig two deep-water berths to accommodate 30,000-ton giant ships. In addition, the engineering staff has even more ideal long-term plans. However, building Xin Gang into a standard northern mega-port will require years. After the site visit, I was reminded of the original Japanese plan to give Xin Gang a throughput capacity of 27 million tons. It was an ideal, but an ideal of great significance.

### China's Blind Intestine – The Sufferings of the People in Eastern Henan – The Yellow River Flood Area – A Few Tragic Scenes

The Yellow River, China's blind intestine, after the breach in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], benefits the nation but harms the locality. For eight years, the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan has been in deep water and fiery heat. The following scenes can tell readers how people in this area are living. In Xihua, we saw a group of women and children urgently awaiting rescue, expecting everything in the midst of hunger, cold, and piteous cries. (See Picture 1)

The Yellow River floods in Shangshui, and the people cannot live in peace. They have suffered in such deep water and fiery heat for eight years. Can we bear to watch them continue to endure a ninth year of suffering? (See Picture 11)

In every Yellow River flood area, countless old women and children collapse by the roadside in the cold wind! The third picture shows only one example seen in Xihua!

### Chinese Poetry in Europe – Switzerland is Best for Mountain Views; Only Holland is Best for Water Scenery

— Holland, 1st January (Shipping News)

Two Chapters by Counselor Wang Jia Hong – Describing Events

The United Nations' efforts to promote new art and its funding of the great achievement of translating poetry into Western languages are a heaven-sent literary movement that has broken the silence of the ideological world throughout history. It is expected that the beautiful scenery of Europe and America will be sung by Chinese poets in the future, and the joy will be overwhelming. Of all the countries in Europe, Switzerland is the best for mountain views, and Holland is the best for water scenery. In the past, the world did not value culture and education, so Western things could not be celebrated together using the most beautiful Chinese characters, which was regrettable. But now it is different. The natural beauty of Switzerland is known to all in the world.

The poems of my country praising Switzerland that are worth reciting include the two chapters by Counselor Wang Jia Hong of the Swiss Embassy, describing his roaming among the mountains and waters. The first says: "Regardless of what year it is today, I think of Wu Huai and Ge Tian. I walk along the stream, forgetting how far I've gone. Leaning on the railing, I listen to the flute, loving the idle clouds. Mixed flowers bloom and fall after the rain. An old man fishes and sleeps when tired. There are other water-playing female companions, their slender waists competing with the beauty of willow branches." The second says: "Walking to where mountains overlap and rivers wind, I see flowers and willows in colorful profusion. The water is as clear as a bright mirror, and the mountains have strange peaks surpassing Mount Xia. My thoughts drift far away with dreams, and fairy music floats from across the stream. Comparing it to the three parts of the moon tonight, Yangzhou may not even account for two."

Poet Saint Huang Yunzhi – Passing Lake Geneva

Reading the poems of Huang Yunzhi, a talented scholar from the highest institution of learning in Beiping, when he traveled in Switzerland, his wonderful thoughts were inspired by heaven, making him even more of a poetry saint abroad. His five-character律詩 (lüshi) "Autumn Day Passing Lake Geneva (Lac Lemen)" says: "The crowd is not surprised by the falling leaves, the west wind shakes my heart, continuing clouds cut off the layers of green, hooked moon penetrates sparse danger, heaven and man are both quiet, following the dream turns deep, the cold waters of Lake Geneva, the waves are fine, and the birds float steadily." And his "Miscellaneous Verses on a Suburban Trip to Switzerland" says: "The vast clear sky is covered by a thin mist, distant snow reflects silver sand, heaven's heart cannot bear the autumn decline, dyeing the frost forest, tree after tree, flowers." The second says: "Torrential rapids flow from high cliffs, the aura of the depths of the springs is even more beautiful, the bright moon comes out after people have left, the pine waves play a secluded melody year after year." The third says: "Crimson and white flowers vying for the splendor of spring surround the fence, farmers and children cheer, I now believe that there are many beautiful scenes in times of peace, melons ripen in the fields, shining like rosy clouds." The fourth says! "The scenery is different, myriad phenomena open, after the homeland's catastrophe, there is wasteland, cloud trees fill the sky in staggered shadows, it seems as if sorrowful swans are chased by the eyes."

The four poems express concern for the people and love for the country, with extraordinary sentiments. The last two lines of the second poem are filled with other worldly joy and are exceptionally unique, and supremely wonderful.

Invited by Queen of Holland – Visiting Het Loo Palace

The extraordinary and sacred scenery of the Netherlands is perhaps not fully known by we Chinese, so I specially record new and old works to provide guidance. In the autumn of the year Xīn wèi (1931), in the ninth month, invited by the Dutch Queen's petite palace, I met with Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina at Het Loo Palace. On a journey into the forest roads and a suburban tour, I recorded the victory: "The vast new machine surges, the ancient palace is autumnal with wind and clouds, six armies divide the trees along the road, a hundred steps look towards the immortal tower, the beauty of the clear light is faint, the green shadows flow throughout the courtyard, the grand scale is beautiful, the evening smoke is softly sad."

Outside the palace gate, the avenue shows the marks of carriage wheels, bounded by long forests, with six parallel roads. Along the roads are huge houses, with towering buildings facing each other, always separated by gardens about a hundred steps apart, resembling the magnificent scenery of famous American cities. Recalling my youth traveling in the New World, my heart is always saddened, without knowing why. On the evening of the 23rd of June, after the rain at 9 PM, I strolled with Zhao Shi to the Green Waste Road above the former fort, looking south at the prairie, and obtained the lines: "Low-lying tiles cover the overlapping terraces, secluded searches reveal the village of my lodging, all the flowers are exquisite, even trees are lush and dense, the language of the alleys is like pearls and jade, the scenery is warm, the heart is idle, the wilderness is pure, I sit and whistle at the green gate."

Returning south from Zwolle to the River Ferry, incidents while on the military train: "Long forests and deep waters record Langhuan, looking towards the river city, going and returning again, new greenery, slanting sun, the wilderness is vast, white clouds, low grass, cattle and horses idle, swimming and getting wet, why worry about drowning, happily letting the wind pass without closing the gates, a peaceful and leisurely place, discussing the way out "to the people"."

### OK Sugar Invented – Dutch Scientists Bring New Sweetness

— Leiden, 1st January (Shipping News). Our Special Correspondent Wang Ren

Sugar is a special product of tropical regions. During the two World Wars, the people of Europe, who love sweets, suffered from a shortage of sugar. This is a very big flaw in modern material civilization that human power cannot easily fill.

Professor van der Weijden of the Netherlands invented a kind of dark brown sweetness before the Second European War. Recently, Van der Kade, a Dutch scientist studying in the United States, improved it and obtained two kinds of qualities: orange-yellow and red. The orange-yellow quality is commercially named O.K. sugar. (Note: The two words O.K. in American promises originally meant Order of the King, that is, a royal order.) It has four characteristics: (1) It is four thousand times sweeter than cane sugar. (2) There is no sweetness after eating. (3) It does not have the strange taste of substitute sugar (saccharin) (written as 副味 in Western languages). (4) The chemical composition is quite simple, easy to manufacture, and does not require special machines.

At a time when the whole world needs sugar, if a country can attack more "OK sugar", on the one hand, it can meet the urgent needs of its own people, and on the other hand, it can share the surplus, sell it to foreign countries, and exchange it for large amounts of foreign exchange, and then benefit the national economy and people's livelihood, which is a win-win strategy.

### New Year's Hopes and Doubts – The Eightieth US Congress Opens!

— Chu Yukun

This week is the beginning of the year 1947. Looking back and forward, I always feel that 1947 has unlimited hope. Everyone knows that what the people of the world have been eagerly longing for day and night after the war is the realization of "peace" and "democracy." Therefore, our hope for 1947 is to hope that 1947 will become a real "year of peace and democracy."

The "Year of Peace and Democracy" has already passed its first week. In these seven days, we have seen the Chinese National Government promulgate a new constitution, the United States declare the end of the state of war, British Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union, the upcoming resumption of the London Palestine Conference, the imminent election of the French president, and other news. At the same time, we have heard the New Year's messages issued by heads of state and leaders from all walks of life, all of whom expressed considerable optimism about 1947.

Thirteen Questions About the Future

However, on the other hand, international counter-currents are still surging, and it is difficult to be overly optimistic about the hopes for the new year. People in the United States who are concerned about international politics have raised thirteen questions at the beginning of the year. They are indeed worthy of our deep consideration: (1) Will the United States lose peace? Or will it steal peace? (2) Will the Soviet Union faithfully strive for "one world"? Or will it allow the world to be divided into two? (3) In what posture will Germany reappear in the ruins of the Third Reich? (4) Will Japan be a peaceful element in the Pacific? Will Korea be a battlefield for ideological struggle? (5) Will China be unified? Or will it continue the civil war? (6) Colonial conflicts are spreading, is there a solution? (7) Can the Balkan problem be solved? What action will the Soviet Union take on the Turkish Straits? (8) Will the Middle East's oil catch fire and burn? Or can it be used for peace? (9) What will happen in Palestine? (10) Will the United Nations' handling of the Franco problem in Spain succeed? Or will it fail? (11) Will the famous countries of Latin America unite? Will Argentine President Colonel Perón establish a fascist regime? (12) Can the Antarctic competition between countries be limited to scientific competition? (13) Will Admiral Byrd's Antarctic exploration be a prelude to the international competition for tin mines?

US Congress Opens

The Eightieth Congress of the United States opened on the 3rd. The Republican Party, which had been in opposition for fifteen years, regained control of Congress. First, it elected Republican Congressman Martin as Speaker of the House of Representatives, who was immediately sworn in and gave a speech, saying: "The current system in the United States has made the United States the greatest country in history. The United States government has no room for those who are biased towards the communist system." During Speaker Martin's speech, the applause of the members of Congress was endless. The US House of Representatives is full of anti-communism and anti-President Roosevelt sentiments, which can also be seen in general. At the same time, the Senate also elected Republican Senator Vandenberg as President Pro Tempore. Because of the bribery case of Democratic Senator Bilbo, it was closed for two or three days, which really made the Eightieth Congress of the United States riot.

Under these circumstances, President Truman submitted a message to the Eightieth Congress, reporting on the future policy guidelines, and he could only appeal to the Republican and Democratic parties to cooperate.

### Recent Situation in Post-War Germany – Communism Gradually Loses Ground

— Written by Arnold, United Press Correspondent. Translated by An Fu

One year and seven months after Hitler's collapse, Germany remains a political mystery in Europe.

However, the elections in Berlin and the four occupation zones in the past three months have cleared up the chaotic political scene, enabling those who are interested in studying post-war German politics to obtain two broad conclusions as follows:

1. Communism, supported by the Soviet occupying forces, has gradually lost ground.

2. If a free and democratic election were held in the entire Germany tomorrow, then the Christian Democratic Party (called the Christian Socialist Alliance in southern Germany) would probably be expected to win the final victory.

These observers believe that in a direct popular election, the first president of the first government of post-war Germany will be the tall and thin Jacob Kaiser, who is the leader of the so-called "left wing" of the Christian Democratic Alliance, 58 years old, and whose headquarters will be located in Berlin.

Many Allied observers now admit – and many Germans will agree – that the Christian Democrats are so popular partly because they have not yet become a "test balloon" for any of the occupying powers.

Today, to regard Germany as a political unit is like trying to connect the internal politics of the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and Britain.

The three western occupation zones, along with the four major parties (Christian Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party, Communist Party, and Liberal Democratic Party), are in fact still isolated from eastern Germany, which is controlled by the Soviet army. Only three parties (the Communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party) are recognized in eastern Germany.

The entire political structure can be said to be "artificial," because these parties themselves were born under the approval of the Allied countries and are only allowed to grow with the protection of the Allied countries.

The two political stages in Germany today revolve around the four major parties. These four parties are the Communist Party (i.e., the Socialist Unity Party) in the Soviet occupation zone and Berlin, which was formed by the merger of the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party this spring; the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party.

In addition, there are smaller "opposition parties" and "ax-grinding parties," but their suffrage is very limited, so their importance in the entire political landscape is also very small.

Today's Communist Party (or Socialist Unity Party), dating back to the pre-Hitler era, represents the old German Communist Party, with strong Soviet communist traits. The German Communist Party, like the Soviet Communist Party, represents the totalitarian party control and class consciousness.

Their party doctrine focuses on liberating the oppressed, consolidating the unity of the working class, and using a strong central government to unify Germany.

Their leaders are selected from German communists trained in Moscow, such as Wilhelm Pieck, who narrowly escaped death in Hitler's purges, and Walter Ulbricht, who returned to Germany with the Soviet army.

Recently retired were the leaders of the left-wing Socialist Party, Ottl Grotoworl and his agent Max FOchner, who allowed the joint organization of the Socialist Unity Party or "mixed" party with the Communist Party.

The Social Democratic Party also encountered Hitler's purge. Although its leaders are weak, it has laid a great foundation in Berlin with a fierce anti-communist program.

In the western occupation zone, their great German leader is Dr. Kurt Schumacher, a one-armed politician who strives to combine Marxist socialism into a modern economic picture and emphasizes British-style "nationalism."

### Many Strange Things in Washington: Truman's Name Missing from the White House Payroll, the President Receiving Money from a Woman Makes One More Confused the More One Thinks About It

— Translated by Ye Yunlan from the Saturday Evening Post

Many strange things happen in Washington; one of which is that the name of the President of the United States has never appeared on the White House payroll. In fact, the President's name is never on any payroll. Once a month, in official terms, he must "request" the government to disburse one-twelfth of his $75,000 annual salary, approved by Congress. However, not a penny less, President Truman always receives his money promptly on the first of each month.

When high-ranking civil servants in the White House, Treasury Department, and General Accounting Office are asked about this puzzling fact and requested to explain it, they invariably shake their gray heads helplessly.

Like any other salaried American, Mr. Truman must pay income tax to the government. Therefore, $1,147.60 must be deducted from his salary, leaving him with $5,102.40. However, his total tax liability is more than that. It is estimated that the President pays a total of $46,000 in federal taxes each year, plus an additional $1,000 in Missouri state taxes, leaving him with a net income of only $28,000. In addition to his regular salary, the President receives an annual expense allowance of $25,000 for travel and other expenses.

The approval certificate is the beginning of the President's complicated salary payment process. According to official protocol, this certificate must be transferred to Woodson, the chief of the Auditing Section of the Accounting Division of the Treasury Department, for rigorous review and approval. The audited payment order and approval certificate are then sent to the office of the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.

At this point, the document falls into the hands of Mrs. Pallas, a middle-aged woman whose official title is "Special Assistant to the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury." A check for $5,102.40, made out to Harry Truman, requires her signature, "B.R. Pallas," before it can be cashed.

After President Truman endorses the check and the bank pays it, it is returned to the General Accounting Office, where it is filed. The office's archives are a legendary collection of autographs, which, if sold, would be worth millions of dollars. These documents show that Washington never received a salary; instead, he was paid piecemeal, with amounts ranging from $200 to $1,300, totaling only $25,000. The current complicated procedure for the President's monthly salary payments began around the time of Jefferson's re-election. His monthly salary was $2,083.33, and after working a full year, he had to add an extra four cents to receive the full $25,000.

Given today's high cost of living, Washington and Jefferson's salaries were, in effect, much higher than Truman's.

### The American President Takes Money From Her

### Nazi Scientists Continue Research Work in America

— Translated by Xu Shangjun from Life Weekly

Even before the end of the war on the European continent, some of Hitler's most valuable scientific workers quietly disappeared from German soil. These scientists, who had helped their country surpass the Allied nations in guided missiles, supersonics, aerodynamics, and ballistics, were immediately sent to the countries that had been their enemies. The Allied nations sometimes had to cooperate and sometimes compete in a "brain hunt" to acquire these spoils of war. In this competition, the United States was clearly the victor. Last month (December of last year), the Department of the Army announced that many of these scientists were routinely engaged in research and design work in the United States.

The first-line advancing troops of the United States had specially assigned officers to search for and recruit key figures among German scientists and industrialists. They did not find this work difficult. Although scientists were being sought by countries all over the world, most of them were willing to accept, even eager for, an invitation from the United States. Very quickly and secretly, Germany's most outstanding minds and priceless research results were transported across the Atlantic. There, U.S. Army personnel were waiting to greet them at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio and Fort Bliss in Texas; later, some were escorted to the U.S. rocket artillery test site at White Sands, New Mexico. There, these scientists immediately set up workshops to study certain problems that the Army had not been able to solve. To this day, these Germans have fully demonstrated a spirit of cooperation and have not concealed anything in response to countless inquiries from American experts.

The Nazi scientists are nominally "non-military employees of the European Theater of Operations of the U.S. Army, temporarily serving in the United States." In fact, they only have short-term contracts with the Army, which the military can change at any time. They live in Army barracks, eat Army rations, receive a daily living allowance of six U.S. dollars, and a small salary is paid to their families remaining in Europe. They are not considered prisoners of war and are free to leave the barracks outside of working hours. Excellent scientists can look forward to receiving full salaries and even obtaining U.S. citizenship. At that time, their entire families can be brought to the United States to reunite. Very few of these scientists want to return to Germany.

Some Nazi scientists narrowly escaped from Germany. Franz, the research director of the Junkers aircraft factory in Dessau, and his assistants discussed the matter in detail and decided that going to the West would be the best course of action. Shortly before the arrival of the Russian army, they retreated with the Americans. Dr. Wernher von Braun, director of the V-2 weapons research program in Peenemünde, and his main assistants, carrying all the documents they could get their hands on, fled to the American lines. Many scientists gladly followed Hitler's call to move to Neuburg in Bavaria because they knew they would meet the Americans there. Although other countries were also eagerly pursuing the cream of German science and occasionally succeeded, the United States has obtained almost everything it wanted. The reason for this is that the German scientists' love for America was the greatest, and their fear of her was the smallest.

### United Nations Headquarters: Manhattan Merchants Unwilling to Relocate

The small business owners gathered on the east side of Manhattan are unwilling to move, even for the United Nations to establish its headquarters there.

"I've been here for sixteen years," said Anna Guiskineski, leaning against the counter of her small grocery store. "My life is good, and now they want me to move."

"Okay, I'll tell them: Give me compensation, give me good compensation. That Rockefeller is very rich. If they give me adequate compensation, then maybe I'll be willing to move."

This is an area of six buildings that Rockefeller plans to purchase for $8.5 million and then donate to the United Nations. The area is on the East River, between 42nd and 48th Streets, and is almost entirely a commercial and industrial district.

"We don't live here, but we like this place," said McCarthy, a gray-haired manager of a paint company. "We make a living here, after all, and we've been here for twenty years."

McCarthy said he didn't know where to find another place.

He said, "If they were planning to build some houses for veterans, then I wouldn't mind. But I don't understand why we have to move for the United Nations."

Across the street, Harry Gaisin watched his 23-year-old son, Leonard, working on a set of tires.

"He just got out of the army," said Gaisin. "I've been in this building for fourteen years. I raised Leonard and made him my manager. Now, what? If the United Nations takes over this place, we'll have to move. Where to? I don't know. I really don't know what to do."

### The Age of the Earth: 2.99 Billion Years

— Translated by An Fu from Reader's Digest

How old is the Earth we live on? Finally, we have an answer. The famous Scottish geologist Dr. Arthur Holmes has announced the age of our planet. Based on precise facts from atomic physics, Dr. Holmes has realized a long-cherished hope of "measuring the depth of geological time." His outstanding research is very moving because the results show that our world is about twice as old as anyone previously believed. Dr. Holmes has not traced the origin of the Earth—on which science is still uncertain—but only the time of formation of the original rocks. He states that our planet is as much as 2.99 billion years old.

Research Base

But what is the basis of his research? This basis is "pure science" and has no obvious practical value. But those who scoff should remember that when Leeuwenhoek used the first microscope to show that a drop of drinking water contained thousands of microorganisms, he was also ridiculed. For almost two hundred years, practical people did not understand what it meant to study this tiny world (microorganisms)—until Pasteur proved that bacteria took more lives than all the wars in history combined. This lesson asks us to take Dr. Holmes's astonishing figures seriously, because this professor from Edinburgh has accomplished a feat of scientific skill.

As early as 1650, Bishop Ussher concluded from biblical arguments that the Earth was 5,654 years old. Soon after him, early geologists greatly extended the age of the world. At the beginning of our century, the great physicist Kelvin, ignoring geological evidence, insisted that the Earth was no more than 27 million years old. But soon after, the discovery of the "clock" overturned every previous calculation.

But let's first look at when humans appeared on Earth. Archaeological facts firmly prove that Neolithic humans arrived in Western Europe 10,000 years ago. Further examining human bones and tools buried underground, we find that humans appeared 30,000 years ago. And the Hominidae, including us humans and other now-extinct human-like creatures, evolved from non-human ancestors as far back as 3.33 million years ago.

Of course, geologists know that other animals, plants, and rocks have existed for even longer. Consider the ocean. Only twelve parts in 100,000 parts of seawater are chalk. Yet 48 million square miles of the ocean floor are thickly covered with chalky ooze, and this ooze is made up of the corpses of tiny organisms in the ocean. These animals need hundreds of millions of years to cover such a vast seabed with their skeletons.

From fossils and coal seams, volcanoes and canyons, science had compiled a large number of books by 1900, proving conclusively that the Earth was at least 200 million years old.

Geological Revolution

Marie and Pierre Curie completed the geological revolution. Their discovery of radium showed that the Earth was much older than Kelvin had imagined because radioactive elements like radium were constantly supplying heat to our planet in ways that no one had previously suspected. But more importantly, radium and uranium provided geologists with a very accurate "clock" to measure past time.

We must understand how these atomic clocks work. First, accurate laboratory tests show that one ounce of radium will disappear by half in only 1,580 years. One ounce of uranium must pass 4.5 billion years before disappearing by half. The remaining half ounce will disappear by half again after another 4.5 billion years, leaving only a quarter of an ounce, and so on. Physics can detect uranium atoms in extremely small quantities and measure the products of their intermediate and final decay. So, when we find these substances in rocks, we can accurately say how long the rocks have existed. Therefore, Curie's research allowed Professor Rayleigh to say in 1921 that life on Earth probably existed 1 billion years ago.

But there was still a serious gap in our knowledge. What was the situation before the radioactive changes began in the rocks we now know? This seemed to be an unsolvable mystery.

In 1938, Dr. Nier published figures on lead ores in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, which were sent to him from lead mines around the world. Arthur Holmes, a scientist from Edinburgh, saw an opportunity in these statistics to solve the oldest mystery.

Detective Story

But it took him two years to find the assistant he needed. That was a computer. Without this computer, the old professor might have spent a million years solving the various equations! Even with the help of this machine, the work of uncovering every clue was very laborious.

Fortunately, we can temporarily put aside the mathematics involved and still follow this amazing detective story. Here is a "headless case" enough to test your thinking ability in many clues.

The basic facts are very important. At the beginning, there are four chemical witnesses: four different metals, lead. That is "normal" lead (204) and its three isotopes (206, 207, 208). These three isotopes are produced during the decay of radioactive elements. Lead 208 is formed by the decomposition of thorium atoms, while 206 and 207 come from uranium. So these leads were all formed on the surface of our Earth's rocks after the world began.

But lead 204 is not formed from any other element. So Dr. Holmes calls it "primordial lead." It came into being with the Earth becoming solid. Geological facts tell us how the isotopes were formed. Countless generations ago, when primordial lead gradually gathered to form lead ore, it passed through the rocks of the vast crust, rocks containing enough uranium and thorium to produce isotopic lead.

Dr. Holmes spent four years finally solving a kind of algebraic equation. The answer he got was that the time that has passed from the formation of the primordial rock to the present is about 2.99 billion years.

### Gold Island

— Shao Fu

Yesterday's Hong Kong dispatch reported on Hong Kong's recent recovery and prosperity. For example, the cars in front of the Peninsula Hotel are lined up again, and the Hong Kong-Kowloon ferries, even those carrying cars from Yau Ma Tei, are shuttling back and forth. The two large bronze lions in front of HSBC have also been shipped back from Japan and are sitting securely on their original stone bases. Most surprising is that the lottery tickets for the drawing on the 14th of this month sold over 300,000 a week in advance. Wealthy people are flocking in, and floating capital is concentrated, making Hong Kong fat and prosperous.

Those who lived in Hong Kong before the victory can deeply understand the policies and intentions of the Hong Kong government in managing this small island. The situation after the victory today should not have changed. However, at that time, our country was at war, and we had no choice but to use Hong Kong as a liaison station. The situation is completely different today. We have no need to escape to Hong Kong, especially when people are in Shanghai but their money is going to Hong Kong. I really don't know what they are thinking. Ah, the island of gold! Yet the Shenzhen blood case happened, and the incident of kicking a vendor to death happened. And what are the results of these two cases? Doesn't this give me some enlightenment?

### New Fog-Clearing Weapon: FIDO

— Abridged and Translated by Sun Zupei from the English-Language Great American Evening News

Fog has become a major threat to civil aviation worldwide, and the recent series of flight disasters have been mainly due to fog. From the Associated Press report below, we can see how the United States is fighting fog.

At Arcata Airport in California, there was recently a demonstration showing post-war progress in fog dispersal. In the demonstration, we saw for the first time the application of the new fog-clearing weapon "FIDO"—burning a hole 700 feet long, 300 feet wide, and 600 feet high in the thick fog in two minutes. An aircraft carrying reporters and observers made eight successful approaches to the runway, although the visibility outside the clear area was only about 500 feet.

"FIDO" was first used in Britain in 1942 by Anglo-American bombers. At that time, they often had to fly to Germany in thick fog and had to have this equipment. At that time, they burned large amounts of aviation gasoline along the runway to achieve the purpose of fog dispersal.

Releasing Dense Fog

The new "FIDO" uses diesel as fuel, which is cheaper than gasoline and has twice the heat energy of the same amount of gasoline; that is, diesel is twice as efficient as gasoline, but diesel requires high pressure and a carburetor. Under 1,750 pounds of pressure, vaporized diesel fuel spews out fiery, smokeless flames from hundreds of injectors, illuminating the surrounding area as brightly as a forest fire. In this intense heat, the fog evaporates quickly, and the outline of the runway is unusually clear with the help of the roaring flames and other lights.

However, "FIDO" also needs the help of ordinary radio, which keeps the aircraft's flight direction consistent with the runway direction and maintains an appropriate downward angle, allowing the aircraft to approach the runway. Recent experiments have also involved burning the flames into a "light groove" of varying sizes, with the smaller end at the beginning of the runway and the larger end two miles beyond the runway beginning. In this way, the driver only needs to drive the plane down this "light groove" to enter the fog hole burned by "FIDO" and clearly see everything at the airport.

American Research

In order to establish knowledge about fog dispersal and other auxiliary landing equipment so that various military and civilian aircraft can fly on schedule regardless of the weather, almost all aviation-related organizations in the United States are participating in fog dispersal research. The Navy, Army, Department of Civil Aeronautics, Civil Aeronautics Administration, Air Transport Association, and Pilots Association have all signed contracts with Arcata Airport to conduct research.

As to why the research site was chosen in remote Northern California, it is because of the foggy conditions and proximity to oil sources. The supply of oil is a major issue in the application of "FIDO." When all the fog-clearing flames at the entire airport are burning at their most intense, it takes three cars worth of gasoline and diesel per hour. Even the new high-pressure "FIDO" requires two cars' worth of diesel fuel per hour, or 25,000 gallons, costing more than $25 per minute.

In the early days of the war in Britain, it cost $5,000 worth of gasoline for a bomber to land. After several improvements, it has now been reduced to $50. For passenger planes stranded by fog, $1 per minute is still a reasonable price. But for small planes, the cost seems too high.

### What World is This?

— Huang Jiamu

Limbs Cut Off and Legs Broken for a Bowl of Rice

Today, people of all classes in society mostly feel the inconvenience of almsgiving. Moreover, the number of beggars is so large that it is impossible to give to everyone, so people's hearts gradually harden. When beggars come to the door or you encounter begging on the street, they are ignored. It is difficult to find even one person in ten willing to give money. This phenomenon has become a very obvious fact, and the hardships of the beggar's life can be imagined.

But the income of disabled beggars is an exception. People are generally more easily moved by beggars with severed hands and feet and blind eyes, especially benevolent grandmothers and ladies, who are most able to empathize with the suffering of beggars. The disabled class of beggars has become the aristocracy of the begging world, causing the gaze and envy of ordinary beggars.

The reason for the disability of beggars is either congenital heredity, or excessive labor of the mother, or carelessness during childbirth, or lack of care as an infant, or injuries such as falls during childhood, which naturally lead to disability. What is considered an unfortunate encounter by ordinary people is actually regarded as a treasure by people in the poverty-stricken beggar world. Because they can use it to practice their "street yelling" career, in their lifetime, they can beg for more money, earning tens of times more than ordinary non-disabled beggars, which makes other beggars jealous.

Influenced by the above facts, the parents of beggars hope that their children will all be born disabled, but often, things do not go as they wish. In this helplessness, they even heartlessly make their children disabled. In childhood, they harden their hearts and cut off part of their limbs or blind their eyes. The most ruthless and inhumane thing is that in infancy, they use various instruments to restrict part or several parts of their limbs, preventing them from developing at the same time as the whole body. When they grow up, they become disabled. Then they are allowed to join the beggar gang to yell on the streets, so they can earn more money for the family.

In many rural areas, because production has completely stopped, people's minds are closed, and they are extremely poor, so customs gradually become barbaric. People growing up there have absolutely no way to find employment, naturally no skills or ideas for employment, and no opportunity for education. The only way out is to live the beggar's life of "touching the gun and begging for money."

This evil custom of artificially creating disabilities is constantly流行流行的 in extremely poor and desolate areas. Especially on the north bank of the Yangtze River, it is simply commonplace and nothing to be surprised about. If readers observe carefully, they will surely find many disabled beggars in this city and many towns they have been to. I have repeatedly seen beggars with amputated limbs in Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places, rolling in the muddy roads of the鬧市鬧市 downtown area, practicing their touching-the-gun beggar gang's "flipping the tai sui" street-yelling life. What world is this, that such tragic things can happen?

### Current Events Q&A: Ten Questions and Answers for 1947

— Answered by Jia Nan

As we usher in the new year, everyone is filled with anticipation for a year better than the last. However, according to dispatches from the French News Agency, Washington insiders believe that there are thirteen major questions looming on the political horizon this year that remain unresolved. I will now transcribe ten of the more interesting ones and offer speculative answers. Whether these answers are correct remains to be seen.

(1) Will the United States obtain peace, or will it lose peace?

Answer: In all matters, great or small, to achieve a goal, one must combine both soft and hard approaches, both rigidity and flexibility. Currently, the only country that seems capable of hindering the United States' efforts to achieve peace is the Soviet Union. If the United States can truly establish a fair and impartial political program, with no selfish elements mixed in, and simultaneously back it up with sufficient strength, then the United States will certainly win peace.

(2) Will the Soviet Union strive for "One World," or will it allow the world to be divided?

Answer: The Soviet Union has its own unique interpretation of the concept of "One World." From the Soviet Union's perspective, it can truly be said that it is constantly striving for "One World." However, from the perspective of other countries, this might actually be an attempt to divide the world. The theory of relativity seems applicable here as well.

(3) From the ruins of the "Third German Republic," in what form will Germany reappear?

Answer: There are three possibilities for Germany's political future: (A) unification of the four occupied zones and establishment of a central government; (B) continuation of the current fragmented state; (C) establishment of a federal government with weak central power and strong local power. Considering the domestic and international situation in Germany, the third possibility is most likely to become reality.

(4) Will Japan become a peaceful member in the Pacific region? Will Korea become a battleground for ideological struggle?

Answer: Speaking from the perspective of the Chinese people, who have suffered the most from Japanese aggression, we must express extreme reservations about whether Japan can become a peaceful member in the Pacific region and should remain vigilant at all times. As for Korea, it is the only place besides Germany where the United States and the Soviet Union have direct land contact. Armed conflict may not necessarily occur, but ideological struggle is unavoidable.

(5) Colonial conflicts are spreading; is there a solution?

Answer: Colonialism is a relic of the age of imperialism. In a world that currently prides itself on ideological progress, it is a great shame for humanity that colonial conflicts continue to be heard of. Future developments will depend on the balance of power between the selfish ideas of the colonial powers and the independent aspirations of the colonial peoples. In 1947, colonial conflicts will likely continue to spread and cannot be resolved in a year and a half. "Truth will ultimately triumph," let us hope this is true.

(6) Can the Balkan issue be resolved? What action will the Soviet Union take on the Straits issue?

Answer: The Soviet Union will never relax its grip on Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Albania. Similarly, Britain and the United States will never relax their grip on Greece and Turkey. It will be difficult to change the established facts, and the stalemate will likely persist for a considerable time. This can be said to be both resolved and unresolved. As for the Straits issue, the Soviet Union wants to open a sea window and will not concede a single step. Britain and the United States want to maintain their interests in the Mediterranean region and will not allow the Soviet Union to step over the threshold of the Aegean Sea. In this situation, there will only be constant arguments and stalemates. The final outcome will depend on the overall world situation. If the Soviet Union is at a disadvantage compared to external forces, it will turn its attention to domestic development. Otherwise, it will seize the opportunity to act and exploit vulnerabilities.

(7) Will Middle Eastern oil catch fire and burn?

Answer: Due to geographical factors, the Middle Eastern issue and the Balkan issue are closely related. If the gates of the Straits cannot be broken open, the oil in the Middle East will not ignite a prairie fire.

(8) What will happen in Palestine?

Answer: The cause of the conflict in Palestine is the mutual unwillingness of Jews and Arabs to compromise. Jews want to establish a Jewish state, while Arabs advocate for Muslim administration and oppose partition. It is lamentable that the holy land of both Jewish and Muslim religions has become such a mess! In fact, the Jewish-Arab issue is only superficial. The crux of the matter lies in the conflicting interests of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Currently, Britain supports the Arab nations, the United States is more sympathetic to the Jews, and the Soviet Union sits high in the north, observing developments with a cold eye. The failure of Britain and the United States to agree on the Palestine issue further complicates the situation.

(9) Will the United Nations succeed or fail in dealing with the Franco issue?

Answer: The Franco regime, which was established with the support of fascist forces, has been able to survive to this day entirely because of the significant contradictions that still exist within the United Nations. Frankly speaking, no country in the world supports the Franco regime. The question is not whether Franco should be overthrown, but rather, into whose hands will the Franco regime fall after it is overthrown: the pro-British and American parties in Spain, or the pro-Soviet parties? The resolutions of the United Nations are insufficient to determine everything.

(10) Will the hostile state in Antarctica be limited to scientific competition?

Answer: Antarctica is a virgin land. Currently, it is like the new continent of America hundreds of years ago. Any country can go there. However, it will eventually be closed off, especially to countries whose security is concerned, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, which will inevitably attach great importance to it. Recently, Admiral Byrd of the United States Navy has led an expedition that has already set off, and the Soviet Union is not far behind, with whaling fleets also sailing to Antarctica. However, compared to the naval and air strength and geographical proximity of the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States, the Soviet Union is at a disadvantage.

### "Flying Picture": Trial Use

At first glance, this picture resembles a team of dancers gracefully performing. In reality, it is the flame emitted by the high-pressure defogging device (Flying Picture) at the U.S. aircraft landing experiment site, used to dispel thick fog. (Special dispatch from The New York Times to this newspaper)

### We Demand Further Education

— Ding Lifeng

Voice of Working Youth

To the Minister of Education: While the flames of war have not yet been extinguished and the education sector is busy restoring transportation, school buildings, funding, and other issues, it may seem untimely for us to present you with the following demand. However, we have been holding it in for a long time, enduring suffering for quite some time, and it has reached the point where we must speak these words.

We demand an opportunity for part-time study and further education. We demand that schools at all levels—elementary, middle, high school, university, and graduate school—offer formal classes with formal curricula during after-work hours to teach us, the youth, young adults, and seniors who come from institutions, shops, factories, and elsewhere with a desire to learn!

Current part-time tutoring cannot satisfy our desires. We want to study trigonometry, geometry, calculus, but they are not available. Geography, history, philosophy, law, education, biology, chemical engineering, electrical engineering... they are also not available! Moreover, part-time tutoring does not grant the qualifications for further education, employment, or official ranking. All of this gives us a severe psychological blow!

Our demands are very simple and not difficult to fulfill. As long as the Ministry of Education does not restrict school hours and orders schools at all levels to offer various courses in one or two classes after work hours, providing convenience to those who are employed in terms of time, that will already be a great kindness from the Minister to us and a great virtue to the nation. After this dual-system education is implemented, the atmosphere of pleasure-seeking in society will definitely change. Now, there is no place to go to school; in the future, those who do not go to school will be ridiculed. The general level of culture will gradually increase, benefiting far more than just ten thousand people!

Perhaps some worry that this will lead to an overabundance of university graduates in society. Then, we can tell them that China's backwardness is precisely because education is not widespread enough and some useful talents are buried. We should not worry about university graduates becoming laborers but should worry about laborers not wanting to become university graduates. Otherwise, wouldn't the work of all departments be smoother and the efficiency of work increase even more?

We hope that you will accept our almost angry plea and use a letter to tell all those who oppose you doing so that we, this group of ten thousand youth, young adults, and seniors, will be your eternal support!

### Recent Trends in French Literature and Art

— Lecture by Claude Roche, translated by Xu Zhongnian

On Sunday, December 22, 1935, in the afternoon, at the ninth "Literary Tea Party" after the victory, Mr. Claude Roche, a Frenchman who had been in China for less than two months, lectured on "Recent Trends in French Literature and Art," translated orally by the author. Mr. Roche is a Parisian with a Master of Arts degree from the University of Paris. He came to China to head the Alliance Française in Shanghai and the College Français. He has extreme admiration for Chinese culture and expresses great sympathy for the Chinese people. This lecture had no written script, and I am now recalling it entirely from memory as follows:

Gentlemen,

I greatly admire Chinese culture, but unfortunately, I cannot yet speak Chinese, so I do not know the content of Chairman Xu Zhongnian's introductory remarks. However, partly because of the great French writers mentioned by Professor Xu just now, and partly because, although Professor Xu and I are newly acquainted, I have long admired Professor Xu. His works introducing Chinese literature written in French are very valuable. I dare to assert that Professor Xu and all of you have great sympathy for French culture. I feel very honored and excited about this!

Every nation must have its own unique genius, and that genius is completely different from the genius of other nations. For example, the genius of the French is certainly not like the genius of the Anglo-Saxons, nor is it like the genius of the Germans. What is the genius of the French? It is: being active, realistic, intelligent, refined, and loving beauty. If we were to give a few representative writers for each item, then: in terms of positivism, there are Descartes, Comte, and Zola; in terms of intelligence, there are La Bruyère, Alfred de Musset, and G. Courteline; in terms of refinement, there are J. Racine and Marivaux; in terms of love of beauty, there are Corneille, Bossuet, and Mallarme.

With such genius, there must also be one or two intellectual centers, and that is philosophy. Contemporary French philosophy is divided into two major schools: (1) Existentialism; (2) Philosophy of Science. The composition of the universe is due to "I" and "Non-I." Why am "I" born? What is the relationship between "I" and "Non-I"? What is the position of "I" in the "Non-I"? Sartre, the master of existentialism, tells us that our "birth" is "absurd": who is born after careful consideration and selection? Our "existence" is also "absurd": who thinks our way of life is rational? Another master of existentialism, Gabriel Marcel, is willing to find a "reason" in the "absurd": that is his "hope." In short, existentialism is a pessimistic doctrine, and existentialist literature is a literature that expresses "despair." This doctrine itself is divided into two schools: (A) Closed Existentialism (existentialisme ferme), represented by Sartre; (B) Open Existentialism (existentialisme ouvert), represented by Marcel. As for the "concentration" of pessimism, naturally closed existentialism is heavier than open existentialism.

The so-called Philosophy of Science originates from the study of atoms. The French authority on the study of atoms is Prince Louis-Victor de Broglie, an expert in wave mechanics (mecanique ondulatoire). Not long ago, we always thought that atoms were indivisible. Now we know that each atom contains two components, and there are "gaps" between these two components: so it is intermittent. On the other hand, atoms produce "waves," and these "waves" are continuous. So, in the atom itself already contains "contradictions." Since the "material" in the world is composed of atoms, it is equivalent to all "material" having "contradictions." This philosophy overthrows the previous determinism. The current authorities on scientific philosophy are: de Broglie, Langevin, and Bachelard.

Next, let's talk about novels. Current French novels can be divided into three major schools: (1) Resistance Novels; (2) Traditional Analytical Novels; (3) Existentialist Novels. Resistance novels have a wide scope; they not only depict the front lines but also the rear; they not only narrate open warfare but also underground work. The master of this school of novels is of course Vercor; his representative works are "The Silence of the Sea" (Le Silence de la mer, translator's note: this book has already been translated twice in Chongqing, and Mr. Li Qingya of Shanghai will make a third translation recently) and "Starry Night Walk" (La Marche a l'etoile, translator's note: this book has already been translated by Zhongnian and is being published serially in "World Bi-monthly"). French novels have always been good at psychological analysis, with a profound perspective. The object of analysis is the French middle society, which can also be said to be the French cadres; the goal of analysis takes into account both strengths and weaknesses. This tradition has never been interrupted. The leader of the current analytical novelists is Francois Mauriac, the author of novels such as "Kiss to the Leper" (Baiser au leppeux) and "Desert of Love" (Desert de lamour). The existentialist novelists are represented by Camus and Malraux. Camus' novels are divided into two categories: fantastic and existentialist. His existentialist novels specialize in depicting "contradictions" and "absurdity." As for Malraux, he has been to China, and his novel "The Conquerors" (Conquerants) depicts the struggle of the Chinese people around 1930. He wants to find the meaning of existence in action, but until now… he has not found it! Just now we talked about resistance novels, besides Vercor, I must also mention the veteran writer Georges Duhamel: poet, novelist, and also military doctor. He witnessed the cruelty of war, so he is a humanitarian. His "Civilization" (Civilisaton) is a masterpiece (translator's note: this book has already been translated by Zhongnian and will be published in installments by "Wisdom").

In terms of plays, they can also be divided into three schools: (1) Lyrical School, represented by J. Giraudoux; (2) Resistance Plays, represented by Anouilh; (3) Existentialist School, represented by Salacrou. The greatest playwright is of course the martyred Giraudoux. His plays often draw material from Greek literature and folk tales from other foreign literatures; in his plays, he depicts the battle between "reality" and "dream," and the beautiful "dream" often triumphs.

The greatest contemporary poets are four: Paul Claudel, Paul Valery, Aragon, and Eluard. Claudel has been to China and Japan. His poems have an extremely strong mystical meaning. It seems that all things in the universe are playing a great symphony, and each nation is a member of the orchestra. Each person's joys, sorrows, and joys cannot be controlled by themselves and are governed by the conductor, and that conductor is God. Valery's poetic rhythm is the most rigorous, and the rhyme is the most sonorous. He pays attention to form and sings the praises of reason. His poetry is "pure poetry" (poesie pure). As for Aragon and Eluard, they are both patriotic poets; their resistance poems are passionate and moving.

The artistic throne left by Pierre Puvis ce chavannes after his death (1898) has always been inherited by Maurice Denis. He is a skilled muralist, and several famous murals in Paris are by Denis. The painter standing alongside Denis is Desvallieres; the characters he paints more fully express inner unease. Other new-wave painters such as Picasso, Matisse, Untersteller, and Braque, each have their own merits.

Let us end this small lecture with music. Nine years ago, in 1937, Maurice Ravel left us forever. This is an irreparable loss for the contemporary French music scene. His countless and wonderful works, such as "Jeux d`eau" (Jeux d`eau), "Valse" (Valse), "Bolero" (Bolero), "Heure espagnole" (Heure espagnole), "Daphnis et Chloe" (Daphnis et Chloe), are purely French in style. Among the contemporary French composers, there is no doubt that Ravel is second to none. As for the surviving musical stronghold, it is Honegger, who inherits the dual traditions of France and Switzerland. We should also not forget the martyred musicians Jaubert, Allain, and J.C. Touche.

Military and political misfortunes have not diminished French culture; on the contrary, it has given it new stimuli and new exercises. Whether in the present or in the future, I deeply believe that French culture will never disappoint the expectations of friends.

### Autumn in the Borderlands

— Qiao An

Anyone who has lived in the old capital should agree that the most wonderful climate and things there are not in spring but in autumn. Spring's life is too short; the abundant flowers, like snow, are scattered and buried by the wind and sand overnight. As Su Shi wrote in his poem, "Spring colors are divided into three parts, two parts dust, one part flowing water," which is indeed true. This is probably the case for the vast area north of Kaifeng, influenced by the Yellow River! However, in the long autumn season, the clarity of the water, the purity of the air, the high and clear sky, and the flourishing vitality of plants, flowers, and leaves perfectly complement the human environment of the old capital. Although it is not youth, it is mature without being exhausted. The enduring and grand, noble and balanced nature of our national character can also be reflected in the northern autumn light. The inadequacies of spring are compensated for in autumn, and life is always so flavorful.

In the tenth and twenty-third years of the Republic (1921 and 1934), I twice traveled to Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Suiyuan, all of which were recently battle-scarred places, and both times were at the height of late autumn and early winter when the first frosts were arriving. Traveling northwest from Beiping, it wasn't long before I saw white poplars standing tall in the wilderness. The trees were tall with large leaves, rustling incessantly in the strong and stern north wind, but the trunks did not sway, and the leaves did not fall (until deep winter), symbolizing the strength of the north, filling one with awe. This overturned our usual notion of white poplars as bringing melancholy thoughts of autumn. The autumn air is pleasant, with its fierce and invigorating energy, perfect for striving for achievement. Why must it necessarily be sad? The so-called autumn feeling, in the empty courtyard at dusk, inevitably evokes thoughts of fallen leaves. But in the high autumn on the frontier, you can't see fallen leaves at all, so there's no need to plagiarize old sayings and imitate Song Yu's lament for autumn. The facilities of the PingSui Railway have a unique style among the various main lines. Although even first and second class carriages lack luxurious quilts and sumptuous meals, the seats are very empty, making it easy for one person to occupy a compartment alone. Amidst the endless sand and harsh winds and snow, one can leisurely enjoy a cup of hot tea, feeling that there is a different world. This is something that people in modern urban life cannot understand, nor could the people who were buried here hundreds of years ago imagine. The wind is still the same wind, the trees are still the same trees, but the person experiencing them has changed their heart.

Indeed, Zhangjiakou, Datong, and Suiyuan are no longer the desolate borderlands that people imagine. The second time I went to Suiyuan, there were already modern hotels, and the living and dining conditions were sometimes even more comfortable than in some semi-developed cities along the river and coast. Even the first time I went, when the railway had just reached Baotou, the food available already had southern flavors, and it wasn't necessary to eat oat noodles all the time. One could still enjoy electric lights and the urban entertainment that came with them in the evening. Many things in the world are easily misunderstood through imagination. In fact, even hundreds of years ago, these places could not be considered desolate borderlands. Datong, in particular, was an important military stronghold in the Ming Dynasty, where many people lived luxurious and extravagant lives, enjoying fine wine, beautiful dances, and clear songs. Besides what is spread in folk tales, there are still some physical traces to be found. For example, the roofs of houses in Datong still have owl-shaped ornaments on the top of their gate towers, which, according to the local gazetteer, is a custom left over from the residences of Ming Dynasty military officers. But the luxury of one era has passed, and they look at the people of later generations from underground, wondering whether they are progressing or regressing?

Among these cities, the most moving and admirable, in my opinion, is still Suiyuan. Suiyuan has both a new and old city, neither of which was built very long ago. They are vast and majestic, showing the spirit of long-distance control at the time. Therefore, the layout of streets and alleys is expansive and spacious, without the bad habits of other commercial ports. Whenever there is a night with clear stars and moonlight, walking along the streets, with willows swaying in the wind above and clear, flowing ditches below, and with flat, solid roads reflecting the sparse electric lights, one feels the vastness of the northern land, giving later arrivals endless hope for expansion.

The residents are certainly quite poor, but since the opening up of wasteland in the late Qing Dynasty, they have utilized waterways to cultivate fields, and the nomadic customs are gradually disappearing. Moreover, their lives are simple. In summer, two pieces of cloth clothing are enough, and in winter, one sheepskin coat is enough. The climate is clean, the population is small, and the need for sanitation facilities is also small.

From the Han to the Tang dynasties, these were originally prefectures and counties, but after the Song Dynasty, they fell to foreign tribes, and the people of the Central Plains gradually forgot about them. From now on, we should get rid of the concept of borderlands and instead seek the prosperity of the Han and Tang dynasties.

### ### Portrait of a General

— Fei La Si Gui

Velasquea was a great master of the Spanish art scene in the sixteenth century. Born in Seville in 1599, he studied painting from a young age and was summoned to the court in his twenties, enjoying great fame. He mainly painted portraits, among which the famous ones include "Philip IV Hunting," "Portrait of a Prince," and "Portrait of a General." This is one of his representative works, now kept in the Prado Museum. The Spanish people regard it as a national treasure. In 1660, he was promoted to an official position in Madrid and died at the age of sixty-one. ( )

### ### Talks on Poetry

— Lin Feng

Modern poetry uses lively language to write about lively life, about the pain, anger, wishes, and aspirations of the people.

Modern poetry is no longer the head-shaking and swaying chanting, or the display of elegance in the wind and moonlight. It is a living painting full of blood and tears, forcing the reader to take out their conscience and approach the sunshine of truth.

Modern poetry is no longer a kind of weak moan; it is our weapon for fighting against the darkness. In the cold season, it gives us warmth; in the dark night, it gives us light; in loneliness, it ignites distant hope; when we walk in filth, it makes us purify our surroundings.

### ### An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Furthermore, those engaged in espionage work, like military strategists conducting military operations, must be "as still as a virgin, as swift as a fleeing rabbit." At this time, Tsurumi's actions should be still, no matter what, should be still; because he only heard a sound, a sudden sentence, without cause, reason, or result; so he cannot move rashly, only wanting to hear a little more. But at the corner of his mouth, where he was concentrating his spirit and listening intently, his knowledge told him that this voice came strangely, that it was only a "voice in his head," so he had even less need to move rashly.

Judging from the tone of this statement, it can certainly be determined that the speaker is Pingzi. But where exactly is Pingzi? True, Pingzi told him to "move around," and he seems to should take this sentence as a serious warning. But when has Tsurumi ever listened to Pingzi's warnings? When they first met at "Green Field," didn't Pingzi give a warning, telling him to "leave Tokyo quickly"? Just today in the phone call, didn't Pingzi relay Elder Aoki's warning, saying that "the search for the secret letter will not succeed"? Didn't Tsurumi not listen to any of that?

Moreover, at this time, Tsurumi clearly does not know where Pingzi is, and presumably Pingzi absolutely does not know that he is in this living room. Then, this sudden warning, how can we know that it is not because he himself has heard too many of Pingzi's warnings, stored them in his subconscious time after time, and that at this time, in a weakened state after excessive nervous tension, they took advantage of the opportunity to attack? So it is said that he simply does not need to move rashly at this time. Moving would simply be like a person who has just woken up from a nightmare chased by fierce ghosts or a fierce battle, jumping out of bed and running outside, just as laughable.

However, although Tsurumi did not get up and move, he did not completely dismiss Pingzi's warning. Based on the experience of the past two days, he admits that this clever devil, Pingzi, does indeed have some tricks. At least, there is also the old magician Elder Aoki, who has some sleight of hand. He also admits that his current situation is like being in a dragon's pool and a tiger's den, with unpredictable dangers. No matter how shrewd and alert you, Tsurumi, are, no matter how thorough your plans are, and no matter how unrelated you are so as not to be implicated, how can you know that the methods of Konoe are unpredictable, and that the Fifth Column is so all-pervasive, and that they have not collected various clues in advance, and then set up a net to trap Tsurumi himself willingly into the trap?

Therefore, once he realized that the voice was a "voice in his head" from Pingzi, and realized that he should not concentrate his spirit and stop the activities of his subconscious mind, he immediately relaxed his emotions again, calmed down, and tried to hypnotize himself, wanting to return to a state of mental distraction, wanting to sense Pingzi and give him some kind of hint.
