### General Mobilization Order Implementation Methods Submitted to Political Affairs Conference for Discussion; All Surplus Military Officers Nationwide to be Retained

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Following the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, detailed rules for its implementation and other related issues have been under discussion by the Executive Yuan, which has convened meetings of relevant ministry and commission heads for several days. The meeting at 3 PM on the 7th was presided over by Wang Yunwu. Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, Gan Naiguang, Qin Dechun (representing the Ministry of National Defense), and Zhao Longwen (representing the Ministry of Food) all attended. The main topic of discussion was the amount of grain to be requisitioned. It was decided that the total amount of grain and currency to be requisitioned from October of this year to September of next year would be 60 million dan. This decision will be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference for discussion on the 8th.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] According to a Military News Agency report: To coordinate with the General Mobilization for Bandit Suppression, military authorities have specifically stipulated that all existing surplus military officers nationwide, regardless of general, field grade, or company grade rank, will be retained, except for those who are qualified for retirement (separation) or who voluntarily retire. It is reported that the Central Training Corps, after receiving the order, will first select 180 outstanding surplus field grade officers and assign them to units for duty. The remaining retained personnel will also be processed by the end of the month.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Xu Siping, Director of the Conscription Bureau, stated on the 7th: After the General Mobilization Order is promulgated, the responsibilities of provincial and county officials in handling conscription affairs will be temporarily increased, and the need for assistance from various parties will also increase; this is to be expected. At the same time, the current situation is no longer comparable to peacetime, and conscription affairs cannot be handled as leisurely as in peacetime. In the handling of conscription, some speed must be sought. As for whether the source of soldiers will increase and whether procedures will change, this will depend on instructions. When asked by reporters whether defense industry workers and others would still be eligible for postponement of conscription, Xu replied: Defense workers are still eligible for postponement of conscription. In addition, the regulations regarding postponement of conscription for only sons, elementary school teachers, and students above the high school level will not change. China has abundant manpower, and those handling conscription hope not to disturb the people too much. When reporters inquired about the recruitment of soldiers in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, Xu replied: Beijing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places have many students, workers, and public school personnel, all of whom are eligible for postponement of conscription. This increases the difficulty of conscription. However, on the other hand, there are also many unemployed and out-of-school people, and there is no shortage of those who are willing to serve the country. Mayors Wu and Shen once requested instructions from the Chairman on this matter. President Zhang, based on the provisions of Article 32 of the Conscription Law, stipulated that "Those who voluntarily serve in the military shall have their service determined by order." Therefore, recruitment is not inconsistent with the law. The only questions are whether the number is sufficient and whether the quality meets the requirements. At the same time, recruitment does not mean that the old mercenary system will be restored. Even if recruitment is sufficient to fill the quota, conscription work will still proceed as usual.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] It is rumored that postal and telecommunications censorship will be restored after the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order. Reporters recently interviewed a responsible person from the Ministry of Communications and the spokesman for the Executive Yuan's News Bureau. They stated that they had not yet received any orders regarding this matter. The Ministry of Communications stated that in some areas, such as the Northeast, which are close to the front lines, postal and telecommunications censorship has not been lifted. Furthermore, news censorship may not be restored after the general mobilization. If necessary, it is feared that it will be limited to military matters only.

[Central News Agency Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Yu Bin and Wang Depu, representing fellow countrymen from Beijing, Tianjin, and the Northeast, paid their respects to Chairman Chiang on the 7th. In addition to expressing their absolute support for the Chairman's unwavering decision to maintain sovereignty and territory in the Northeast, and expressing their deep admiration for the loyal and courageous soldiers who defended Siping, they also contributed several suggestions for rescuing the Northeast crisis, which attracted the Chairman's attention. In particular, the suggestion to actively mobilize the people's organizations, strengthen local armed forces, and expand the Commander-in-Chief of Pacification system to awaken the spirit and efforts of the Northeast compatriots to save themselves and the country was especially appreciated by the Chairman. The Chairman also encouraged the Northeast compatriots, especially public servants, to unite sincerely, be selfless, and accomplish the task of completely recovering the Northeast and realize the Chairman's long-cherished wish to have the people of the Northeast build the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 7th Dispatch] On the eve of the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, the Northeast People's Armed Organization's Clearing and Suppression Committee, with the consent of the authorities, was renamed the Northeast People's Mobilization Committee, in order to contribute the Northeast's manpower and resources.

### President Chiang Encouraged Party Members; Completing the Mission of National Construction with Hard Work and without Complaint Chen Cheng Reported on the Results of One Year of Bandit Suppression

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 7th Dispatch] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng made a military report at the Central Party Headquarters' Memorial Week at 9 AM on the 7th. He pointed out: Two years since victory, due to the Chinese Communists' rebellion, plotting to subvert the government, and betray the country, they have even harmed the people, causing a second serious national crisis, so that none of our plans for demobilization, reorganization of the army, and peaceful construction have escaped their destruction. Finally, they opposed the National Assembly and the Constitution. In order to save the people, the government had no choice but to resort to military suppression. Regarding the military situation of the bandit suppression, Chen first explained the situation of the Communist bandits. The Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Yeh Jianying bandit troops numbered about 200,000. The Southern Hebei Liu Bocheng bandit troops numbered about 100,000. The Southern Shanxi Chen Geng bandit troops numbered about 40,000. The Northern Hebei Nie Rongzhen bandit troops numbered about 90,000. The Northern Shanxi He Long bandit troops numbered about 30,000. The Northern Shaanxi Peng Dehuai bandit troops numbered about 40,000. Those unifiedly commanded by Lin Biao outside the pass totaled about 300,000. In total, there are 970,000 rebellious bandits inside and outside the pass (including militiamen). Chen then recounted the course of the war, detailing the battles in the Northeast and North China regions. Finally, he summarized the results of one year of bandit suppression, divided into the following points: (1) Recovering northern Jiangsu, making it difficult for the bandits to continue their food supply. (2) Destroying the military supply factories built by the Japanese army along the Ping-Sui Railway line, cutting off the bandits' replenishment. (3) Seizing the bandits' political center, Yan'an, and undermining their morale. (4) Ensuring the results of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Although the Communist bandits colluded with foreign forces, attempting to reap the benefits, the National Army completely defeated Lin Biao's main force in the battle of Sipingjie last year, and recently inflicted a serious blow on the bandits in Sipingjie again. Regarding the unrecovered areas in the Northeast, it is hoped that the entire region will continue to be recovered. (5) Recovered 212 counties in one year, seizing 710,913 various guns and cannons. (6) Approximately 1,642,333 rounds of various ammunition were captured, and 94,381 bandit soldiers were captured, and 145,285 bandit soldiers surrendered.

[Central News Agency Nanjing 7th Dispatch] The National Revolutionary Army Oath-Taking Commemoration Meeting and the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters' Founder's Memorial Week were held jointly in the auditorium of the headquarters at 9 AM on the 7th. After President Chiang led the salute, Committee Member Chen Cheng reported on military affairs. Chen said that today is also the tenth anniversary of the "July 7th" Lugouqiao Incident. Recalling the victory achieved by the hard-fought eight-year Anti-Japanese War by the entire nation, he was filled with indignation that the goal of demobilization and national construction could not be achieved due to the disaster brought to the country and the people by the Communist bandits. Then, he reported in detail on the recent military situation, the process of suppressing bandits, and the achievements of bandit suppression in the past year. In the end, Chen made a firm statement, saying: All officers and soldiers in the country will definitely implement the government's order to suppress bandits, and must have the greatest determination to be the vanguard of suppressing the rebellion, and hope that the compatriots across the country will cooperate in the spirit of sharing weal and woe, so as to quell the bandit rebellion as soon as possible. After Chen's report, President Chiang also made an important speech, briefly stating: The government has now issued a national general mobilization order, the meaning of which is to strengthen the bandit suppression force, and at the same time strengthen the construction work. The most important of the construction work is to implement the Principle of Democracy and promote democracy in accordance with the established national construction procedures. On the other hand, it is the reform of internal affairs. At this critical moment of national difficulty, party members of our party should display the revolutionary spirit, work hard and without complaint, overcome all revolutionary obstacles, and complete the mission of suppressing bandits and building the country.

### Vice-President Sun Spoke About the Current Situation; Implementing General Mobilization Could Shorten the Time of Internal Chaos; The Proportional Representation Requested by the Two Parties is Still Under Discussion

[Our Newspaper Report] After Vice President Sun arrived in Shanghai, he responded to reporters' questions on the current situation, which are recorded as follows: (1) The proportional election requested by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party is a problem that needs to be solved, and is currently still under negotiation with the Soviet Union. Outer Mongolia is in fact a vassal state of the Soviet Union and has not established diplomatic relations with our country, so all negotiations must be conducted through Moscow. As for the rumor that Soviet troops have occupied Tacheng, I have not heard of it when I was in Beijing. (3) The relationship between China and the Soviet Union is currently not good. This is because the Soviet side has failed to abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty and has not returned Lushun and Dalian. As for the Soviet Union's recent withdrawal of overseas Chinese in China, it is due to the lack of manpower in the country, and it has no major relationship with the diplomatic relations between the two countries. (4) When asked whether the government's issuance of a mobilization order could shorten the time of internal chaos, Sun said: The government is concentrating all its efforts to quell the rebellion, and the period can be shortened, but only God knows when the internal chaos will end. Also, "After the mobilization order is issued, political parties can no longer oppose the civil war, otherwise they will be opposing the government and must be resolutely dealt with. You may pass this message on to the Democratic League." Sun denied the rumor that he would go to Guangdong.

### The Shipping Industry Has a Major Task During the Period of General Mobilization; Premier Zhang Provides Opinions on the Construction of the Shipping Industry

Premier Zhang Qun arrived at 10:45 a.m. and delivered an impromptu speech, stating briefly: Unfortunately, the country is suffering from the Communist bandits' rebellion. It is the government's responsibility not to tolerate this any longer. It has clearly ordered the implementation of general mobilization in order to quickly save the people from fire and water and restore unity. From now on, military transport will be even more frequent, and the shipping industry's responsibility remains very important. On the government's side, regarding fuel supply, material replenishment, navigation safety equipment, and the maintenance of traffic order, we will naturally do our best to meet the hopes of shipping merchants and reduce their difficulties. On the shipping industry's side, we hope even more that those in charge and personnel in various departments will demonstrate a high degree of patriotism and love for the nation, remember the difficult times, understand the government, and cooperate. It must be understood that during the period of national military suppression of the rebellion, weapons and ammunition are more important than clothing. These forces must be replenished quickly and reliably in order to bring the rebellion to an end as soon as possible, restore the country to unity as soon as possible, and allow the people to live in peace. The most efficient transport method is also the most dangerous, requiring the most [illegible] and time. Therefore, during the period of general mobilization, the shipping industry's task is actually as important as that of the military. Subsequently, regarding [illegible] aspects, the following were suggested: (1) [illegible] integration and reorganization; (2) developing [illegible] lines; (3) proper equipment and efforts to progress; (4) building [illegible].

Yang Changbei Raises Matters Requiring Attention

Then, Yang Changbei, a representative of the shipping industry, delivered a speech, stating briefly: In the past, our country did not pay attention to the improvement of shipping policies. The convocation of this conference today is fortunate for the shipping industry as it allows for research and discussion of shipping policies. However, we believe that the establishment of shipping policies requires attention to issues such as the increase in tonnage and the shipping policy itself. Increasing tonnage can expand foreign trade and earn foreign exchange, which will help the financial situation. Shipping administration has protection, which will also help the financial situation. Shipping administration has protection, and the shipping industry can comply with it. The second is the protection and development of shipping rights. We should be determined to protect our shipping rights and not allow foreign ships to intrude. Other issues related to the shipping industry, such as fuel, loans, route allocation, insurance, and safety, all await discussion at the review meeting. The speech ended with a salute.

[Our Dispatch] Liu Weichi, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, told reporters yesterday: The work of repatriating overseas Chinese has been largely completed, and we will now focus on developing overseas Chinese affairs. Of the millions of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, more than 100,000 fled back to China during the Pacific War. To date, more than 70% have returned.

The future development of overseas Chinese affairs will focus on the restoration of overseas Chinese economic activities in various places. In terms of immigration, the immigration restrictions in the United States have been improved, and an agreement may soon be established with Canada.

However, due to the wide area of the disaster, reaching 60 counties, and the 5 million affected people, a joint meeting was held to discuss measures, and the following was decided: (1) Send senior officials to handle the disaster relief matters jointly with the provincial government and Director Huo of the Executive Relief Administration. (2) The Executive Yuan will allocate 30 billion yuan for relief. (3) It has been found that there is still a large amount of rice available in Guangdong Province, and the United Relief Administration will be consulted again to agree to allocate it for emergency relief and water conservancy projects. At the same time, relevant agencies will be strictly ordered to strengthen assistance in transporting grain, rescuing refugees, and carrying out health work. In Guangxi, the disaster area covers more than 50 counties, with 12 counties being particularly severe and 1.5 million people affected. It was decided to send senior officials to inspect and handle emergency relief jointly with the provincial government. The Executive Yuan will allocate 2 billion yuan for emergency relief and allocate large sums of money to purchase surplus rice from neighboring provinces. In Fujian, the disaster is relatively severe, and 400 million has been allocated for emergency relief.

Editorial

### Urgent Repair of the Yellow River Levee

With the Yellow River's major flood season approaching and the threat of flooding imminent, the UNRRA office in China has suggested that our government and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) both cease all military operations within five miles of the entire Yellow River riverbed and levee, so that re-embankment work can be completed before the end of July to prevent the disaster of a major flood. Our government fully accepted UNRRA's suggestion and sent personnel to form a joint committee with UNRRA and the CCP to accomplish this task. Unexpectedly, the CCP's Liu Bocheng's troops took the opportunity to forcibly cross the Yellow River at Dongkou, harassing the south bank and obstructing the re-embankment of the Yellow River, causing the dikes in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong to be in imminent danger of breaching, and the situation is extremely serious. For the sake of the lives and property of the people in this vast area, we must not miss the opportunity to prevent disaster, and we would like to make an appeal to all parties to urgently repair the Yellow River levee.

The Yellow River levee has not been repaired for nine years. After the closure of Huayuankou was completed on March 15 this year, the Yellow River was re-diverted to its original course. However, the repair and defense work along both banks of the river is more difficult than blocking the breach. If repairs are not made before the flood season, a breach in the levee would unfortunately repeat the disaster of the Huayuankou flood, and the lives and property of the people would be unimaginable. The Yellow River has four flood seasons each year, and the major flood on July 1st marks the beginning of the dangerous peach flood season. This year, due to the chaos of war, there are many problems with urgent repairs and defenses. After the Ministry of Water Resources was established, it instructed the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau to supervise the three defense offices of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan to recruit workers and collect materials, and to rush repairs day and night. On June 21, representatives from the government, UNRRA, and the CCP held a meeting in Heze and reached an agreement stipulating that July 15 would be the deadline for the completion of the initial project. At the same time, the UNRRA office in China also proposed a ceasefire between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and stepped up re-embankment, and advocated that residents of the Yellow River Delta should be evacuated immediately to avoid repeating the disasters caused by floods before the war. The proposal further expressed UNRRA's willingness to cooperate with the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to mobilize manpower and materials at any time to assist in mediation, in order to promote work and supervise projects, and save the catastrophe. UNRRA's spirit of service and clear vision deserve admiration!

Unexpectedly, the CCP lacks rationality and disregards conscience, and does not value matters that are closely related to the vast majority of the people. Before the ink on the Heze agreement was dry, the Communist troops on the north bank began firing, and recently Liu Bocheng's troops on the border between Henan and Shandong, disregarding the people's suffering, secretly sent a large army to cross the river to harass them. This shows that the Heze agreement was a pretense for negotiation by the CCP, and its real intention was to take advantage of the National Army's unpreparedness and the tension of the re-embankment work to launch a surprise attack to the south. Its treachery is the same as Li Zicheng's digging up the Heigangkou of the Yellow River at the end of the Ming Dynasty, but in terms of action, Liu Bocheng is even more lacking in rationality and conscience than Li Zicheng. Presumably, those who sympathize with the CCP, witnessing this situation, must have a new understanding of the CCP and recognize that they are unreliable.

The urgent repair and defense of the Yellow River re-embankment is a constructive undertaking, a peaceful project, and needs to be carried out under the premise of peace and tranquility. Now, the Yellow River levee, from Kuhe in Guangwu, Henan, to the sea entrance in Lijin, Shandong, is 1,200 li long. Including the section near Jinan on the south bank, the government controls one-half, and the north bank, except for Chenqiao and above, is almost entirely occupied by the Communist army. If the CCP is unwilling to cooperate with the government and UNRRA in a peaceful situation to carry out the re-embankment project, the government and UNRRA have little power to reverse the situation to carry out peaceful urgent repairs and defenses. After the major flood strikes, they can only sit and watch their usual efforts fall short. UNRRA officials are well aware of the political situation in our country, so they urgently suggested that both sides cease fire along the river. The Ministry of Water Resources understands this situation, so it has made many efforts to win the cooperation of the CCP and established the Heze Agreement. Unfortunately, Liu Bocheng's "surprise attack" completely shattered it. He launched a surprise attack on the lives and property of tens of millions of people. He is "struggling" and "liquidating" with the people. If this blind action is not stopped, the major flood will arrive in a blink of an eye, and the disaster will be unimaginable. Therefore, we would like to state the following propositions:

(1) We hope that the CCP will restore rationality, abide by the promise of the Heze Agreement signed in mid-June, accept UNRRA's suggestion to immediately cease military operations within five miles of the levee, withdraw the blind troops, and cooperate with the government and UNRRA to quickly complete the Yellow River re-embankment project in July.

(2) We hope that UNRRA will mobilize manpower and materials to assist water conservancy engineering agencies, distinguish between urgency and adapt to the situation of peace and tranquility, and complete the levee work at each mouth section by section. If the CCP refuses UNRRA's suggestions with actions, UNRRA should, from a position of upholding justice, stop all material assistance to the CCP as a warning to those who violate justice. If UNRRA does not punish them, the CCP will disregard any international cooperation in the future.

(3) We hope that the National Army will take swift action to eliminate and prevent Liu Bocheng from fleeing south, ensure the safety of the dangerous works at Dongkou, and be more vigilant against the Communist army destroying any dangerous works on the levee during the major flood period; otherwise, the flood will overflow and the lives and property of the people will be wiped out, and the people of the three provinces will not be able to withstand this catastrophe again. The Communist army does not want the people, and the National Army needs to win the people over.

In short, the Yellow River flood is approaching a dangerous juncture, and urgent repairs and defenses are imminent: we must not sit back and wait for the peach flood to strike because the CCP has violated the agreement. The sun and moon move in tandem, and rivers never cease; the ancients have said it: we hope that the government will overcome all difficulties and relieve the people from their distress. At the same time, we call on enlightened people to use the power of public opinion and the voice of justice to force the Communist army to stop military operations, so that the people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River can face this dangerous juncture and avoid an unprecedented catastrophe!

### May I Ask the London Times

The London Times, generally regarded as the mouthpiece of the British ruling class, has recently put on colored glasses and commented on the situation in our country since the implementation of the national mobilization, believing that the only way to save China from suffering is to quickly organize a truly united government. We do not understand what the current government of China is if not a united government? The Kuomintang is no longer a one-party dictatorship, and the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, which are in the opposition, have now joined the government? China now has a "National Government" composed of multiple parties, which is actually a united government; we cannot say that we still need to quickly organize a truly united government because the Communist Party has not participated. If this is not a lack of understanding of the current situation in China, it is because it has been poisoned by the CCP's malicious propaganda. May I ask, the United Kingdom also has a Communist Party, but have they ever participated in the "National Government" led by Churchill during the war; but was Churchill's "National Government" not a united government?

There are many talented people in the United Kingdom, but the British are also most likely to be unknowingly poisoned by the CCP's propaganda. I recall that when the current British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel, took office in the United States, he also said that the Chinese Communist Party was not a true Communist Party, but only a rural reformer. This is the propaganda that the CCP hopes foreigners will recognize them as, and the British Ambassador became their mouthpiece. We lament the talents of the British. Today, the London Times's argument is similar, and it also coincides with the CCP's propaganda to some extent. We do not believe that a qualified newspaper like the London Times would also be a mouthpiece for the CCP. Otherwise, why...?

### After the Soviet Union Rejected the Marshall Plan, the United States Strengthened its Determination to Aid Europe, Possibly Adopting a Wartime Lend-Lease Approach; France has Exerted Every Effort to Achieve Understanding with the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, London, 6th] The Washington correspondent of the "Sunday Times" recently reported that the United States may adopt a wartime lend-lease approach to aid other countries, controlled by "a new supreme authority." The attitude adopted by the Soviet representative at the Paris Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference has strengthened the United States' active assistance to European countries that support the Marshall Plan.

[Agence France-Presse, Chalon-sur-Saône, 6th] French Foreign Minister Bidault delivered a speech here tonight stating that France has exerted every effort to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union. Although we do not recognize this division as a definite division, France's position is clearly different. France will move forward together with countries that are willing to rebuild Europe in peace. Secretary of State Marshall's proposal for European recovery is extremely commendable. In order to make American aid a reality, France has an extremely important position in Europe. I hope that the Popular Republican Movement can support my efforts.

[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] The French diplomatic community is worried about the possibility of European countries splitting into two opposing camps regarding Secretary of State Marshall's European recovery plan, but it is said that the door to cooperation is still open, and it is hoped that the Soviet Union will participate. It is said that Europe has been divided for hundreds of years, and the Marshall Plan actually provides Europe with an opportunity for coordination. Relying on this, Prime Minister Ramadier declared at a Socialist Party meeting that the Marshall Plan is "the only way to organize the European economy. We must jointly assume the leadership responsibility with the United Kingdom to engage in European recovery."

[Reuters, Manchester, 6th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton stated in his speech today that the United States government is willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union, but it cannot wait too long. If the Soviet Union cannot participate immediately, then the United Kingdom and other European countries will not wait for the Soviet Union, but will cooperate to carry out their European economic recovery plan. The United Kingdom hopes that the Soviet Union will still participate in this plan in the future.

[United Press, London, 7th] Within the British Labour Party and Conservative Party, opinions on Bevin's policy on the Marshall Plan are gradually diverging. Left-wing member Mikardo delivered a speech saying, "Bevin knows that the United States will never allow the Soviet Union to profit in any dollar zone. It is a pity that Bevin did not stand up and speak out in Paris. How can we first invite someone like Molotov to attend the meeting, and then 'denigrate' him for policy differences?"

### Czech Republic Expresses Willingness to Accept Invitations from Britain and France to Participate in European Conference, But with the Precondition of Obtaining More Reports

[Associated Press, London, 6th] The "London Daily Telegraph" quoted a broadcast from the Czech capital Prague today stating that regarding the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the all-European economic conference in Paris on the 12th to discuss Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid European recovery, the Czech government has expressed provisional acceptance, but on the condition of "obtaining more reports on the Marshall Plan and its implementation methods."

[Our News] London, 7th Radio: Czech authorities said that the Czech Cabinet held a meeting on the morning of the 7th to discuss whether the Czech Republic should accept the invitations from Britain and France to participate in the American aid to Europe plan conference. Also, Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk will go to Moscow on Monday or Tuesday to attend a meeting. According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the commercial delegation to the Soviet Union to negotiate a new commercial treaty departed on the 6th, but the Minister could not attend due to illness.

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] People here expect that the visit to Moscow by senior Czech government officials this week will determine whether any Eastern European countries will participate in the 24-nation European economic conference. Of the 22 countries invited by Britain and France, it is now known that Finland has refused to attend, and Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Romania are expected to follow in Finland's footsteps. Among the other invited countries, 14 have already affirmed their acceptance of the invitation or expressed their willingness to accept. The Czech Ambassador to Paris said tonight that Czech Prime Minister Gottwald and Foreign Minister Masaryk are scheduled to leave for Moscow on Tuesday. He stated that the Czech government has not yet decided whether to accept the invitations from Britain and France. French officials here are eagerly hoping that the Czech Republic and other Eastern European countries can participate in the Paris conference on the 12th of this month and actively participate in the recovery plan for Europe. If so, then the Soviet Union's subsequent joining would not be impossible.

According to a dispatch from Moscow from this agency, Moscow believes that Eastern European countries are unlikely to participate in the Paris conference, and the Soviet Union is still actively pursuing a policy of economic self-sufficiency. Today's Zhenli Bao's special commentary once again accused the Marshall Plan of expanding the Truman Doctrine, intending to organize Western European countries against the United States. The article also pointed out that the suggestions of Britain and France are a threat. The path taken by Britain and France is contrary to international cooperation and the interests of the European people. The Paris Observer further predicted that after the Czech-Soviet negotiations, the great powers may take the following three actions: (1) Czech Prime Minister Gottwald will decide that the Czech Republic will not participate in the Paris conference, in which case Poland and other Slavic countries will also take the same route. (2) Gottwald may be encouraged by the Soviet Union to participate in the Paris conference together with other Eastern European countries, adopting a delaying and obstructing policy to prevent the implementation of the Marshall Plan. (3) Gottwald may be able to strongly argue to the Soviet Union that the Czech Republic must participate in the discussion of American aid in order to see what happens, so that Eastern European countries will not be accused of destroying the recovery plan for Europe.

### Lie Arrives in London; Optimistic about European Conference

[Reuters, London, 7th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie arrived in London today after returning from the United States to Norway for a one-month vacation. He expressed optimism at the airport about the conference to be held in Paris on July 12 to discuss the Marshall Plan. He does not believe that the failure of the Paris Tripartite Conference last week indicates that the Soviet Union has announced its final decision. He believes that the recovery of Europe requires the cooperation of the Soviet Union, and the attitude expressed by the Soviet Union's affiliated countries regarding the invitations from Britain and France is quite optimistic. Lie also said that he does not intend to attend the Paris conference when it opens on Saturday. He also does not believe that the United States intends to send observers to attend, but the development of the conference will be notified to the US Ambassador to France. This is Lie's first month-long vacation since taking office as Secretary-General of the United Nations, and his family also returned to the country with him.

### Zhenli Bao Reporter Says Britain and France Harbor Malice

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 6th] A Zhenli Bao foreign affairs reporter recently published an article stating that the initiators of the Paris Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference had decided in advance to destroy any possibility of the conference's success in order to take action alone. The ill intentions can be seen from the agenda proposed by the initiators. In short, the reason why the Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Conference failed to reach an agreement was due to the position of the British and French representatives.

### Greece Formally Invited to Participate in Paris Conference

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 7th] The Greek government today formally confirmed that it has accepted the invitations from Britain and France to participate in the Paris economic conference.

### British-Soviet Trade Negotiations

[Reuters, Moscow, 6th] A statement regarding the British-Soviet trade negotiations being held here will be issued in the coming days. It is reported that the British delegation led by British Secretary of State for Foreign Trade Wilson intends to extend their stay for a week to ten days before returning to the UK. The British side hopes that the Soviet Union will supply as much wheat and feed as possible to Britain with its 1947 harvest. The Soviet Union also intends to supply Britain with the aforementioned grains in the four years before 1950. Britain believes that if the Soviet Union wants to obtain major financial concessions, then Britain must be able to obtain a large amount of grain from the Soviet Union's 1947 harvest.

### Yugoslavia Withdraws from the International Labor Bureau

[Our News] London, 7th Radio: International Labor Bureau Director Fee announced that Yugoslavia has notified the Bureau of its withdrawal from the International Labor Bureau.

The Mystery of "Flying Saucers": Rumors of them Being as Large as Five Rooms; Similar Monsters Found in Canada

[Reuters, Spokane, Washington, 7th] News today says that the mysterious "flying saucers" in the American sky have landed in the foothills near St. Mary's, Idaho. According to a Mr. Johnson, he saw eight "flying saucers" fall into the forest. The flying saucers flew in from the north at extremely high speed. Near St. Mary's, the speed gradually decreased, and they fell like falling leaves, but after landing, they disappeared without a trace, and the trees were not damaged in the slightest. The flying saucer looks like a round washing basin, with an area about the size of a five-room house. Officials have not yet believed the aforementioned rumors. However, a jet plane at Muroc Air Force Base in California yesterday and six fast fighter jets in Portland, Oregon, were prepared to chase these "flying saucers." An officer of the US Army Air Corps in Washington told this agency that the Army Air Corps has been investigating the "flying saucer" rumors for ten days, but has not yet found out what they are. We do not believe that anyone in the country or abroad can have a rocket bomb with a speed of 1,200 miles per hour. We have not engaged in any experiments that can explain this mysterious object, and we do not know whether government personnel inside or outside the government are engaged in such experiments. Rocket scientists are as confused and do not understand as we are. A science writer once said that he had seen a "flying saucer" near his home, but it was the reflection of the aircraft's body.

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 6th] Canada today reported another discovery of a "flying saucer." Various European capitals reacted with skepticism, believing it to be similar to the "mysterious fireballs" seen last October, disappearing as mysteriously as they appeared. According to reports, in October of last year, military authorities announced that equipment had detected a certain "mysterious fireball" passing over Switzerland, but its nature could not be determined. It is speculated that it may be a fire test on the coastline controlled by the Soviet Union.

### French Socialist Party Congress Supports Ramadier's Policies; Government Willing to Work Hard to Stabilize the Country

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Prime Minister Ramadier addressed the Socialist Party National Congress today, emphasizing that France must act quickly to lead the economic recovery of Europe. He believes that only by responding to Marshall's plan and cooperating can European countries restore their economic balance. When Ramadier mentioned the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan, he said that the door remains open for the Soviet Union to join. He then described the domestic situation, saying that the government intends to maintain an orderly path between the extreme left-wing elements who launch strikes and riots and the extreme right-wing elements who raise the anti-communist banner in an attempt to change the republican regime. As for the government's economic policy, its goal is to combat absolute state control and absolute uncontrolled economy.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] After a nine-hour meeting last night, the French Socialist Party National Congress approved Prime Minister Ramadier's government's policies by a vote of 2,576 to 2,058, with another 127 abstentions. Two other resolutions were passed: one to protect and support Marshall's European aid plan, and the other to call for the implementation of far-reaching economic recovery measures in the country. The first resolution stated that the Marshall Plan is a unique opportunity to establish a European recovery plan, and expressed gratitude to the American government and people. The second resolution requires the government to balance the ordinary budget, reduce military spending, curb inflation, investigate prices, and rectify wages. The Socialist Party's participation in the government is conditional on the National Assembly immediately authorizing the implementation of the above-mentioned economic plan.

A Split between the Socialist and Communist Parties is Inevitable

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] A draft by the Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party declared last night at the party's executive committee that the mistakes made by the Communist Party in France and the mistakes made by the Soviet Union internationally have made it impossible for the French Communist Party to regain power at present. According to those in charge, even the left wing of the Socialist Party now admits that the split between the party and the French Communist Party is already certain.

### The US Army Department's Mobilization Plan Achieves Initial Major Success; Hundreds of Industrial and Public Agencies Support It

[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to the US Army Department's disclosure on the 6th, hundreds of industrial and public agencies have united to support the Army Department's mobilization plan, so that if another war occurs, a trained manpower source can be provided to serve in the troops immediately. According to the Army, this plan to form 20,000 reserve units in industries, hospitals, and city governments across the country has achieved major initial success. The organization of the reserve army is still based on veterans who served in the supplementary force during World War II, and all railways, hospitals, chemical companies, and aircraft and automobile factories are included in this plan. According to the Army, the plan to organize these agencies is now proceeding as quickly as possible. In the event of a war, the Army will require these agencies to provide trained personnel, and the Army will be able to send them to the battlefield to perform combat missions without undergoing long-term training.

### Twenty Prominent Americans Oppose Universal Military Training

[United Press Washington, 6th] Twenty prominent Americans participating in the National Council Against Conscription attacked the universal military training plan advocated by President Truman's advisory committee on the 6th, stating that it would truly cause World War III and end the life of the United Nations. Members of the council, including former Secretary of the Navy Daniels, University of Chicago President Hutchins, Senator Johnson, and National Farmers Union President Patton, all condemned the plan, saying: The advisory committee's promise to the nation that it could save itself by preparing for war in the event of a showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union is shocking. The council attacked the advocacy of universal military training as an emphasis on nationalism rather than internationalism, and to this end, they put forward the following alternative methods: 1. Frankly admit that the only security for the United States lies in the elimination of war. 2. Adopt a universal disarmament plan. 3. Strengthen the United Nations' power to resolve all world disputes. 4. Promote relief and rehabilitation plans for the peoples of the United Nations, including the Soviet Union. 5. Replace compulsory military training with voluntary training until the world organization and disarmament are completed.

### U.S. Navy Tests Sound Wave Detector

[United Press Washington, 6th] The Navy Department announced on the 6th that preliminary tests have been completed on a detector being conducted to discover the location of a person falling into the sea, or the location of a person rescued at sea by air. The Navy Department said that this new invention can predict the location of the victim before rescue ships and aircraft are dispatched. The new invention is named the sonic range finder. The first station has been operating in Monterey, California. Several four- or six-pound bombs dropped near the Hawaiian Islands can have their sound waves received at Monterey, 2,300 miles away. If an aircraft crashes into the sea, the victim can release a sound wave bomb, which propagates through the water at a speed of one mile per second, and can be received by a detection station on shore. By comparing and studying the sound waves heard at each station, their exact location can be discovered. According to the Navy Department, this test was conducted last year in the Bahamas in the Atlantic Ocean, receiving the sound waves of a bomb dropped 3,100 miles away in Dakar, Africa. Official estimates put the maximum distance at 6,000 miles.

### International Grain Conference to Open in Paris Tomorrow; Representatives from Fifty-Two Countries to Attend

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 6th] The International Grain Conference is scheduled to be held in Paris on the 9th of this month to study the grain needs of various countries. According to officials here, the discussion of the grain needed by various countries is related to the Marshall Plan. However, the convening of the International Grain Conference was decided before the Marshall Plan was announced. The International Grain Conference is hosted by the International Emergency Food Committee of the Food and Agriculture Organization and will invite representatives from 52 countries around the world to participate, with 130 agricultural experts serving as advisors to the representatives of various countries. The purpose of the meeting is to avoid future food shortages. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Anderson will deliver the opening remarks, which are expected to touch on the Marshall Plan's proposal for the reconstruction of Europe. Although the issue of grain prices is not on the agenda, it will be discussed.

### Various Political Parties Express Dissatisfaction After Japanese Government White Paper Released; Ashida Advocates Using Japanese Assets Abroad as Compensation

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese Diet began a free discussion of general policy on the 7th. Each party selected eloquent speakers to serve as questioners, including Sanichi (Democratic Party Executive), Ozawa Saego (lawyer) from the Liberal Party, Ishida Ichimatsu (orator) from the People's Cooperative Party, Doi Naomi (General Federation executive) from the Socialist Party, Kawaguchi Yoichi (agricultural association executive) from the Farmers' Party, and Hayashi Hakuro (lawyer) from the Communist Party. During the House of Representatives meeting, representatives from each party first gave ten-minute speeches on the economic white paper, which were then answered by the ministers. The focus of the questions remained on food policy. The Liberal Party opposed the report as being too pessimistic, saying that it caused the nation to lose hope for reconstruction. Commerce and Industry Minister Mizutani replied, "The facts are the facts; why can't they be reported?" Communist Party member Tokuda said that what the report said about the livelihoods of workers was utter nonsense. The free discussion of the economic white paper will continue for about two weeks. On the other hand, the House of Councillors also freely discussed the economic emergency measures recently announced by the government, with eight representatives from various parties questioning on political, economic, diplomatic, and financial issues. The revision of railway fares without Diet deliberation also became an issue, keeping the government busy responding.

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 7th] Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida Hitoshi declared in the Diet today that if the compensation principles established after World War I are still valid, then Japan's assets abroad should be considered as compensation. According to well-informed sources, Japan's assets abroad will likely be considered as compensation, but it is not known whether this principle is valid.

True Foreign Trade Must Begin After Treaty is Concluded

A council member also raised the question of "How does Japan intend to develop foreign trade?" Commerce and Industry Minister Mizutani Chozaburo replied: "After the Allied merchants arrive in Tokyo, we will discuss specific methods, but I would like them to understand that true foreign trade can only begin after Japan's peace treaty is concluded." Finally, the councilors unanimously rejected extending the session until August 30. The meeting was originally scheduled for 54 days and was to end on August 7.

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese House of Councillors resumed its plenary session at 10:08 AM on the 7th. First, Democratic Party Councilor Ito Toyoharu raised questions. The various state ministers replied as follows: (1) State Minister Wada considered the issue of balancing with the world economy when deciding on economic emergency measures, but domestic efforts are necessary to the greatest extent in order to obtain foreign aid.

Japanese Working Masses Should Also Endure Sacrifices

(2) State Minister Nishio, representing the Prime Minister, replied to Communist Party Councilor Hosokawa Karoku, saying: The Socialist Party is not sacrificing the laboring class to protect the interests of big capital. However, Japan is currently in a national crisis, so the working masses should also endure suffering in order to revive the nation. The Socialist Party's policies have not fallen to the level of the Liberal Party's policies, but the Socialist Party does not hold an absolute majority in the Diet, so it is inevitable that its original policies cannot be fully implemented.

Three-Party Agreement Not Reached on Coal Mine Nationalization Issue

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese government's three governing parties, the Socialist Party, the Democratic Party, and the People's Cooperative Party, held a consultation on the issue of coal mine nationalization on the 7th. At the meeting, the Democratic Party argued that increasing coal prices would not enhance production, so it was necessary to nationalize coal mines. The three governing parties did not have a unified opinion on this issue and adjourned without reaching a result.

### Indonesian Emergency Cabinet Meeting Convened

New Note to be Presented to the Dutch Side

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 7th Broadcast: The Indonesian Republican Cabinet convened an emergency meeting in Java to consider re-presenting a new note to the Netherlands. According to well-informed sources, the wording of the new note is very unfavorable and may ignite renewed fighting. The cabinet meeting was held shortly after Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit returned. According to Dutch sources, Governor-General Van Mook informed Setyadjit that Indonesia's note was unacceptable. Therefore, Mr. Setyadjit specially returned to Java in an attempt to get the Cabinet to make further concessions.

[United Press Batavia, 7th] Indonesia believes there are still some points in Van Mook's operation that are easily misunderstood and need to be clarified. Therefore, Republic Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit returned to Java this afternoon, and an emergency meeting was convened. The Dutch authorities specially sent a plane to escort him. The points that need to be clarified are, first, the interim government; second, the Republic's responsibility for internal affairs; third, the joint gendarmerie; and fourth, foreign relations. The Dutch side considers each of these points to be the most important. Setyadjit said he hoped to return here tomorrow.

Marshall and both Secretaries of the Army and Navy attended the debate.

### Serious European Population Problem Has a Significant Impact on the Future of Europe

— Special Translation by the Editorial Office of this Newspaper

Europe's population problem today is unusually serious. In the two years after World War I, over one million people left Europe. In the two years after World War II, very few people were able to leave Europe.

According to the International Refugee Organization, the total number of homeless refugees in European countries today is over one million. In addition, there are another nine million people leaving Eastern Europe. Besides these groups, there are countless Europeans who want to leave that shattered continent. According to some experts, the number of people currently intending to leave Europe is about 100 million.

For almost a century, until 1930, people streamed out of Europe to sparsely populated parts of the world. The number of people moving out varied, but it never stopped. In the past century, an average of 500,000 people moved out each year.

Europe's economic and political crises have driven emigration to a peak. The Irish famine of 1847 and the German revolution of 1848 sent large groups of starving people and refugees to safe and free areas. The industrial revolution in Eastern Europe caused a large number of farmers to move to the cities, which was the last major exodus.

After that, new press blockades were erected. Until the early 20th century, the United States received 80% of European immigrants, with a total of 40 million Europeans entering the United States. However, the implementation of immigration restrictions in the United States in 1921, and the tightening of restrictions in 1924, greatly reduced the flow of immigration and changed its direction. In the following years, Latin America took the first place in immigration, with several British dominions led by Canada absorbing most of the immigrants. Later, immigration restrictions became a common policy in various countries, but more importantly, the global recession cut off employment opportunities everywhere. By 1933, the number of people returning to Europe was greater than the number of people leaving Europe. From that time on, the fascist countries in Europe desperately increased the population in areas that were already overcrowded.

Narrow-mindedness and racial hatred were elements of Nazi policy. This xenophobic psychology did not begin with Hitler; it existed in the earliest cultures. Hitler's policy was merely an intensification of it. The new serious population problem is a legacy left to the world by the Nazis.

Indeed, Europe's population problem today has reached a very serious stage. Europe is currently facing population pressure unprecedented in history. However, there are several places within Europe that urgently need residents and laborers. At the same time, there are many places outside Europe that have not yet been developed and can absorb a large number of immigrants. However, these countries exclude foreigners and hostile ideologies, aggravating the obstacles to immigration. Although various countries have immigration regulations, they are all accompanied by restrictive clauses that hinder the entry of foreigners.

The Jews of Palestine have experienced a holocaust unprecedented in history. The Nazi Party systematically murdered six million Jews, leaving one million in various parts of Europe (excluding the Soviet Union), of whom 250,000 currently live in refugee camps, and the rest are scattered in countries where anti-Semitic sentiment remains strong. These Jews are desperately trying to return to Palestine.

Italy's population has been squeezed to the point of bursting, and most of them are in debt. Italians have always liked to develop abroad. Since Mussolini implemented the policy of increasing the population, Italy's difficulties have been greatly aggravated. The war has further caused panic over food and jobs. The number of births exceeds the number of deaths by an average of 400,000 per year.

The number of French people displaced by the war is over eight million. Most of them were displaced by the Nazis. More than seven million of them have returned to their home countries, and the remaining one million are still wandering around Europe, homeless.

The conflict of ideas and ideologies has divided Europe. Political exiles are everywhere. Of the more than 350,000 Spaniards who fled Spain in 1939, they are still confined to southern France, hoping that the day of political clarification will come and they will be able to return to their homeland.

Despite suffering losses from the war, Germany's population has increased by 1.5 million. Germany's current territory is only three-quarters of what it was before the war, and most of the people are old, young, sick, and disabled. The population density is 519 people per square mile, which is 62 times the density of the United States.

What Britain lacks most is manpower, and what it needs most is coal. In order to supplement the manpower needed by the coal mines, transportation industry, textile industry, and other industries, it has to employ female workers and foreign laborers.

The Soviet Union's population increased by 20 million during the war, but it urgently needs 7 million laborers today. Soviet officials admit that 890,000 German prisoners of war are still working in the Soviet Union, but outsiders estimate their number to be about 3 million.

France is also currently using German prisoners of war to supplement the population lost due to the war. France currently lacks 1.4 million laborers and hopes to recruit them from Italy, Ireland, Algeria, and Germany. (Translated from "U.S. News & World Report")

### Spanish Citizens' Referendum Approves Succession Law; Voting Order Generally Good in Various Regions

[United Press Madrid, 7th] According to unofficial vote counts tonight, the Spanish people have approved the Law of Succession by a majority of ten to one. After tabulating more than half of the voting districts nationwide, United Press shows that 5,664,904 votes are in favor, 350,477 votes are against, and another 195,855 votes are blank.

[Reuters Madrid, 7th] Spanish Interior Minister Bayens told foreign reporters that there were no unexpected incidents nationwide during yesterday's voting on the Head of State Succession Law.

[Agence France-Presse Madrid, 7th] Spain held a referendum yesterday to vote on the new Law of Succession. According to the final results, 83.2 percent of the voters in the capital region voted in favor, accounting for 72.5 percent of all voters in the region. Interior Minister Jiang Caizi told foreign reporters last night that the voting order was good, and the general mood was pleasant. Only two telephone lines were cut in the Liria region. The Spanish Morocco General declared the referendum to be a pro-Franco parade. Ninety-six percent of voters in Ceuta and Melilla voted in favor, and the situation was the same in the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. Mainland Spain performed best in Castile. The Law of Succession authorizes Franco to choose his successor, a provision that has aroused strong opposition from royalists.

### MacArthur is Headstrong; Australia Expresses Extreme Indignation

[United Press Washington, 6th] Australia is dissatisfied with the US occupation policy in Japan, and its relationship with the US may experience friction. It is said that when the peace conference on Japan is held, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt will state his opinions. Evatt went to Japan on Sunday to inspect and prepare for the Japan peace treaty conference to be held in Canberra, Britain, next month. Therefore, it is expected that he will express his opposition to MacArthur in person this week. The basic reason for the dispute between the US and Australia is that Australia originally wanted to play a major role in handling post-war policy towards Japan, but has now been relegated to a secondary position, and is therefore expressing indignation. It is especially unhappy with MacArthur's actions, as if the United States is unilaterally in charge. In addition, the disputes between the US and Australia also include the following: (1) The US has obtained most of Japan's trade, which Australia firmly opposes. Of the private business firms that can do business with Japan, which were determined last Thursday, the US received 102, and Australia only 23; (2) MacArthur allowed Japan to engage in development work on Angaur Island, which was supported by Secretary of State Marshall, but Australia's protest was ineffective; (3) Australia demanded that Japan not engage in private airline business during the control period; (4) Australia protested against not being allowed to participate in the handling of the Japanese fleet that should be retained, and Australia needs some small warships and water tankers; (5) On the issue of compensation, Evatt believes that the Far Eastern Commission is not the proper body to decide this issue and advocates leaving it to the peace conference for discussion. Evatt is also deeply concerned that the committee may draft the peace treaty with Japan before the peace conference is convened.

### Convenient Import of Japanese Goods into the United States by Varying Taxation

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 6th] The Department of Commerce announced today that the government has taken steps to facilitate the import of Japanese goods into the United States. In the future, these goods will be subject to US customs duties based on their export value in US dollars, rather than being taxed according to market prices, due to the abnormal situation in Japan. The current measures are the same as those taken for German goods in May of this year.

### Argentine President's Broadcast Speech Calls for World Peace and Cooperation; Willing to Use Resources to Help Countries Affected by War

[United Press Argentine Capital, 7th] Argentine President Peron delivered a broadcast speech today, calling for world peace and pledging to use Argentina's resources to help countries affected by war. It is said that international harmony can only be achieved by ensuring domestic peace. Argentina deeply feels the needs of countries around the world. We must replace poverty with prosperity, while not falling into the mistake of making aid a favor. All countries in the world should do their best to eliminate extreme capitalism or totalitarianism, and mankind should be above systems and ideas. Peron's speech has been translated into four languages and broadcast to the world through 1,165 radio stations.

[Reuters Argentine Capital, 6th] Chilean President Videla arrived here today by special plane for an official visit.

### India Will Become a Battlefield; Gandhi is Grieved

[United Press New Delhi, 6th] Today, the Assam and Northwest Frontier Provinces held a referendum. Gandhi declared in the parliament here tonight, "Every child in India is prepared to fight to maintain national defense. European history will be staged in India. It is heartbreaking and shameful to think of India becoming an airport. I pray that God will lead us away from darkness and towards light." Gandhi also said that Assam and the Northwest Frontier Province should part as friends, but this is not the case, which is very sad. The Indian army will also be split, and the future two countries of India will become armed camps, which will inevitably increase huge military expenditures. Shahir, the leader of the Congress Party and Prime Minister of the Northwest Frontier Province, also said that the province should secede from India and Pakistan and become independent. Gandhi agreed with this. The leader of the Muslim League said that this attitude attempts to undermine Governor-General Mountbatten's plan for partition, and believes that most of those in the province who belong to the Muslim League or sympathize with the Muslim League. Observers here feel that the people of the Northwest Frontier Province are brave and good at fighting, and have been the most difficult nation to govern in India for many years. The result of the vote will definitely be that the majority will agree to join Pakistan.

### Referendum Begins in India's Northwest Frontier Province

Yesterday in Pei Wah district, 20,000 "Red Shirt" members of the Congress Party held a parade, shouting slogans along the street such as "We will seize freedom and sovereignty by force." It is reported that the voting order in the Pittan and Kahn districts was good.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The third joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce held its first session at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 3:00 PM. Thirty-one directors and supervisors from various provinces and cities across the country have registered, including 13 directors present, 16 proxy representatives, and 2 supervisors, which meets the legal quorum. In addition to the directors and supervisors, guests present at yesterday's meeting included Lu Jingshi, Director of the Social Affairs Department; Ouyang Lun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs; Peng Erkang, Secretary of the Organization Department; Liu Qiguang, Chairman of the Taipei City Chamber of Commerce; and National Assembly representatives Dai Tianqiu and Zhu Huiji. All directors and supervisors, in response to the National General Mobilization Order and Chairman's broadcast appeal to the nation, passed a resolution to telegraph President Chiang expressing their support.

As of yesterday, the conference had received a total of 57 proposals, which were scheduled to be examined in groups starting at 9:00 AM this morning and discussed at the afternoon session. The conference was chaired by Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Union, who stated in his opening remarks: According to the association's articles of association, a meeting must be held at least once every six months. Although this is the third joint meeting of directors and supervisors of this term, it is the first time it has been held in Shanghai. The Shanghai branch office of the association is ready and will officially open today (July 7), with Shou Jingwei as the director. Furthermore, Luo Qinghua, the first Secretary-General of the association, has requested to resign due to poor health, and Shou Jingwei has been appointed to succeed him. Observing the international economic trends and the hardships of domestic industry and commerce, there are two points I would like to sincerely discuss with you all: (1) I hope the government will implement economic reform plans as soon as possible to stabilize finance, curb prices, and save industry and commerce from their current crisis. (2) Economic stability is based on labor-management coordination. At present, disputes often arise between the two sides, which is a hidden worry for society. I hope the conference will discuss this in detail and propose solutions.

### The Government Strengthens Bandit Suppression, Industry and Commerce Unite in Support

Lu Jingshi then delivered a speech, saying: The reason for the current economic crisis lies in social instability, that is, the scourge of bandits. The government has strengthened bandit suppression, and the industrial and commercial sectors unite in support. At the same time, he expressed great sympathy for the industrial and commercial sectors' request to increase the number of legislative members. Peng Erkang said: In the past, there was no connection between the industrial and commercial sectors themselves, so the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Union has a major mission in the country's economic construction. The Chairman has indicated that bandit suppression and resistance against [omitted text] are equally important, so the current period can be described as "suppressing bandits and building the country." Ouyang Lun said: The Chamber of Commerce Union is the leading organization of the industrial and commercial sectors, and the main task now is to cooperate with the National Government's General Mobilization Order. After the officials finished their speeches, Dai Tianqiu reported on the process of striving for the number of National Assembly representatives from commercial groups, and Liu Qiguang reported on the recent situation of industry and commerce in Taiwan and its importance in the trade with Japan. At this point, the directors present, including Lu Xiaobo (Jiangsu), Wang Yiqi (Nanjing), Ji Dianchuan (Tianjin), He Yagu (Guangdong), and Qiao Senrong (Ningxia), spoke one after another, expressing their unique insights and detailed analyses on taxation, foreign exchange, and the government's various economic policies. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 PM, and at 7:30 PM, the Chamber of Commerce Union held a welcome dinner at the Shanghai Municipal Bank Club for the directors who had come from afar.

### Eight Organizations Telegraph Support for the Chairman's General Mobilization Order

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Fishermen's Association, and the Municipal Local Association, among other organizations in this city, telegraphed the Chairman to express public opinion in support of Chairman Chiang's recent promulgation of the National General Mobilization Order. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Chairman Chiang Kaishek of the Nanjing National Government, most urgent, since the victory of the War of Resistance, the national territory has been restored, and the wounds of war are being healed. The central government and the people are making a new start, working diligently day and night, hoping to unify government orders and implement the constitution. All that has been done is as clear as the sun and stars. However, the Communist Party has harbored evil intentions for a long time, acting like bandits, occupying land with soldiers, betraying the country and harming the people, difficult to return from their misguided path, evil exceeding its limits, so that the universe has no day of clarity, and the people are trapped in fiery heat. The central government has the heart of great benevolence and wisdom, and takes swift action, eliminating treacherous villains, launching punitive expeditions, eradicating fierce beasts and floods, and raising weapons. Recently, the National General Mobilization Order has been promulgated, in order to concentrate all efforts and quell the rebellion. Divine strategy and subtle tactics are used to enlighten and instruct. Our association, etc., on behalf of all the citizens of Shanghai, pay our respects to this grand plan to save the country and rescue the people, and express our absolute support. We hope that the ten items of governance will be implemented vigorously, swiftly and decisively, working together in the same boat, quickly sweeping away the traitors, and restoring a clear universe. We respectfully submit this telegram to express our intentions, and humbly request your consideration. The Shanghai Municipal Council, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association, Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Shanghai Municipal Fishermen's Association, and Shanghai Municipal Local Association jointly submit, [omitted text]."

In addition, the Minzhi Jianguo [People's Governance and National Construction] also telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, supporting the General Mobilization for Communist Suppression.

### Yu Shuping Officially Appointed Police Chief, Formal Announcement Expected Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yu Shuping has been internally designated as the official Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and this matter may be formally announced today.

According to Commander Xuan, before this, Tao Yishan, Yu Shuping, and Yu Jimin were recommended as candidates to succeed the Shanghai Police Chief. At the time, Tao's voice was very high, but after the General Mobilization Order was issued, the authorities believed that Tao's position as Chief of the Garrison Command was very important and should not be changed. Yu Jimin also serves as a member of the Shandong Provincial Government, and cannot leave his post for ten days at this critical time in Shandong's military affairs. Therefore, it was finally decided that Yu Shuping would succeed him. Moreover, Yu Shuping came to Shanghai with Director Xuan after the victory, and has been in charge of Shanghai's police administration for two years, making great contributions. Yu studied police administration in Germany and Austria in the past, and after this official appointment, he will surely be able to display his talents.

### Allocation of Rice to Factories, Schools, etc., Application Deadline is the 15th

Oil Allocation Plan Under Review

[Our Newspaper's Report] The deadline for applications for rice allocation for factories, schools, hospitals, prisons, and charitable organizations for July has been set for the 15th by the People's Food Allocation Committee. According to Zhang Shude, the head of the committee's review department, those whose applications were rejected in June were due to non-compliance with the regulations. The quantity reductions were due to inaccurate numbers of people, as the allocation committee determines the number of people based on the rosters previously registered and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau by the various labor unions.

The plan for allocating oil based on population is currently under review by President Zhang of the Central Bank, and is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month. Each person will receive half a catty, and the allocated price will be much lower than the market price, but the exact amount has not yet been determined.

### Two Labor Disputes Resolved

[Our Newspaper's Report] The index dispute between the employees of 53 factories in the wooden loom group of the city's weaving industry has been resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. It was agreed that the wages for May would be calculated at 20,000 times the index. In order to consider the difficulties in the capital side business, from June to September 15, during the slack season, wages will be paid at 23,500 times the May index, regardless of the monthly increase or decrease in the published index. Base salaries of 30 yuan or more will still be calculated with the government-stipulated discount.

### Rickshaw Pullers Request Rent Reduction, Capital Side Only Agrees to 10% Discount

[Our Newspaper's Report] The rent for rickshaws in this city was previously agreed upon by labor and management on February 17, setting 6 jiao as the base and calculating it according to the previous month's cost of living index. Now, because the cost of living index was unfrozen in May, the burden on rickshaw pullers has increased. At the same time, the increase in new public bus lines has greatly affected the rickshaw business, so they requested to pay rent at a 60% discount. The capital side stated that if the rent for July is calculated according to the index, it should be 15,000 yuan, but now it is no more than 11,000 yuan. In addition, the price of car licenses is high, which is difficult to maintain. If it is to reduce the impact on business, the maximum discount is 10%. Yesterday morning, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation session, but no results were achieved. The Social Affairs Bureau plans to propose a compromise.

### Five Million People Urgently Awaiting Assistance, Establishment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Disaster Relief Association, Sun Ke and Others Jointly Host Expanded Fundraising, Hoping All Sectors Will Not Hesitate to Contribute Generously

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Tiecheng, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Ye Gongchuo, Wang Yunwu, and Liu Weizhi, in order to expand fundraising for the Guangdong disaster, specially jointly hosted a reception for people from all walks of life in Shanghai at the Kang Le Grand Restaurant at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon to report on the situation. More than a hundred guests attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jilou, Fang Zhi, Du Yuesheng, and Wu Yun Chu. Mayor Wu arrived at the venue before the meeting, but left in a hurry due to other business and did not participate in the meeting. Wu Tiecheng, Wang Yunwu, and Ye Gongchuo were unable to come to Shanghai due to various reasons, and Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, and Liu Weizhi represented them in hosting the meeting. Chairman Sun Ke gave a speech, saying that the severity of the flood disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi this time is even worse than the Xijiang disaster in the fourth year of the Republic [1915]. More than sixty counties in Guangdong have been affected by the disaster, with millions of victims. If emergency relief is not provided, the victims will be in an unbearable situation. The Executive Yuan has ordered the Relief Administration to allocate food and relief funds, and the State Council has also approved an emergency [omitted text] proposal for the National Bank to first lend 20 billion yuan for emergency relief. Furthermore, fundraising is being carried out extensively throughout the country and overseas. However, the scope of the Guangdong disaster is very large. According to estimates by the Provincial Government and the Headquarters, the first phase of emergency relief requires as much as 300 billion yuan, so the relief work must be borne by the whole country, and please all sectors of Shanghai do their best to [omitted text].

Relief Funds Require 500 Billion

After Vice Chairman Sun finished his speech, Liang Dechao reported on the disaster situation in Guangdong, saying that the disaster in the fourth year of the Republic was due to the flooding of the Xijiang River alone, while this time, four rivers flooded together, so the disaster is extremely severe. Among the 108 counties in Guangdong, 52 counties have been affected by the disaster. There are more than 5.5 million victims, and the number of dead and injured that has been calculated is more than 5,000. Guangdong has a rainy season harvest once a year, and now the last season's harvest is completely hopeless. About 30% of the dikes and other projects have been destroyed. The provincial government's initial report estimated that 300 billion yuan would be required for relief. Recently, Director Zhang of the Headquarters came to Shanghai to talk: in addition to 350 billion yuan for relief, 150 billion yuan is also needed for dike repairs, so a total of 500 billion yuan is needed to be effective. However, the funds currently available are only 20 billion yuan lent by the National Bank, 10 billion yuan in donations from Guangzhou, and 800,000 Hong Kong dollars in donations from Hong Kong (equivalent to 7 billion yuan in national currency), which is truly a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem.

The Disaster Situation is Urgent and Cannot be Delayed

After the report, the Presidium invited Du Yuesheng to speak. Du was weak and had difficulty breathing when speaking. His speech was very short, expressing that disaster relief does not distinguish between regions and that he would follow the gentlemen and do his best. Pan Gongzhan then spoke, saying that he sympathized with the plight of 5 million compatriots in Guangdong who have been displaced by the floods and lack food and clothing. If 100,000 yuan is used to maintain the life of each person per month, the total will require 500 billion yuan, and with the current pressure of life, 100,000 yuan is only the bare minimum. The disaster situation is urgent and cannot be delayed. Although Shanghai's industry and commerce are not very prosperous at present, it does not have the man-made disasters of North China, nor the natural disasters of Guangdong and Guangxi, so the citizens of Shanghai should work together in their capacity as compatriots to rescue the Guangdong disaster. Based on the history of disaster relief, Shanghai is often responsible for the majority. Whenever there is a disaster in any part of China, Shanghai must not hesitate to do its part. This time, we should continue the past spirit of disaster relief and work together with other places to relieve the Guangdong disaster.

All Sectors in Shanghai Cannot Stand Idly By

Xu Jiguang said in his speech that the business community in Shanghai is mainly composed of people from Guangdong and Ningbo, and now that there are disasters in Guangdong and Guangxi, Shanghai cannot stand idly by. Fang Zhi said in his speech that Guangdong is the hometown of the Founding Father of the Republic and the birthplace of the revolution, so the people of the country are particularly concerned about the disaster in Guangdong. The citizens of Shanghai will definitely do their best to assist the affected compatriots, and the municipal party department will follow the gentlemen and do its best. Wu Yun Chu, Li Cangbo, Qin Runqing, and Yang Xiaotian then spoke successively, expressing their sympathy for the Guangdong disaster and their willingness to do their best to assist in disaster relief.

Vice Chairman Sun Takes Office as Chairman

Dong Tianmin, the person in charge of the Shanghai Dianyi Association, said on the spot that he has convened people from the performing arts circles in this city to form a Guangdong Flood Relief Committee, which will hold a charity performance at the Tianchan Theater for three days starting on the 16th of this month, with the income used for disaster relief. Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang have agreed to participate, and ticket prices are divided into 200,000, 150,000, and 100,000 yuan. At this point, members of the Presidium Wang Chonghui and Liu Weizhi successively stated that the Guangdong disaster is severe, and there is also a flood in Guangxi. Disaster relief is like putting out a fire, so they decided to establish the Guangdong-Guangxi Disaster Relief Association immediately and planned to invite Du Yuesheng to serve as the chairman of the board of directors to proceed as soon as possible. After Du repeatedly declined, Sun was nominated Vice President to serve as the president, with Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilou, Fang Zhi, Wu Yun Chu, Yang Xiaotian, Cheng Cangbo, Feng Youzhen, Fan Shaozeng, Gu Jiatang, Dong Ganwen, Zheng Ziliang and his wife, and Sun Zhesheng's wife serving as standing directors. It was also decided to hold the first board meeting at the Shanghai Bank this Friday at 5 pm.

### The Re-appointment of Professors in Various Universities in the City Will Be Decided After Director Zhu Returns to Beijing

[Our Newspaper] Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education came to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss the issue of re-appointing professors for the next semester with the heads of various universities.

### Protecting Teachers' Professions and Stabilizing Education in the City: Director Gu Continued to Reply to City Primary School Requests Yesterday

More than 50 directors and supervisors of the City Primary School Friendship Association and representatives from various districts gathered at the Central No. 1 School in the Fifth District yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to continue to make requests to the Education Bureau. Xu Ziling accompanied Director Gu and Director Zhu to the meeting. The director gave a detailed explanation of each point requested by the association, saying: "The regulations for the appointment and dismissal of teachers and staff will be the same as the separate regulations for principals, and he promised to issue re-appointment orders to the principals of each school immediately, which will allow the principals to re-appoint teachers and staff in stages. Protecting teachers' professions and stabilizing education in the city is what the principals expect and is also the decision of the senior leadership. The salary for July has already been answered by Deputy Director Li and will definitely be issued early. The Municipal Council approved the expenditure for this academic year by appropriating 7.2 billion yuan from the existing 20% of education funds, and the bureau should comply with this. However, the municipal treasury is tight and the appropriation of funds is slow, which has caused all teachers and staff to suffer from the depreciation of the currency, which is deeply regrettable. Recently, the accounting office has been instructed to concentrate all other funds in the bureau as much as possible and first raise and distribute 200,000 yuan per person before July 10, and the remaining amount is also being sought. As for the item of borrowing tuition fees from parents in the next semester, there is no legal basis, but there are understandable reasons. If all parties can be contacted to avoid increasing the burden on the poor and children of public teachers, and wealthy parents are happy to donate for the education of their children and to understand the hard life of the teachers, he will give principled sympathy to it from an individual standpoint. As for the payment of salaries based on the cost of living index, as long as all teachers and staff work hard in their positions in cooperation and stability, the central government will definitely have the hope of adjusting it in August and September. It is heard that the abnormal development of the current treatment of public teachers is being closely watched by Director Zhang of the Executive Yuan. Everyone has the same feeling that it is not a matter of quantity but of inequality, and calling for survival is not a dishonorable act." The representatives of the association were deeply moved by the director's earnest words, and they decided to follow the director, share weal and woe, and were unwilling to turn their backs on the request. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. The parts that could not be resolved immediately were planned to be submitted to the next board of directors meeting to continue to work hard with all parties concerned.

### The Import Control Committee Negotiates with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc., to Improve the Allocation of Industrial Raw Materials; Fixed-Price Contracts Must Be Countersigned by the Review Committee

[Special dispatch from our newspaper] The Industrial Raw Material Import Quota Allocation Review Committee, organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association, was invited yesterday by Shen Zouting, the director of the Quota Allocation Department of the Import Control Committee. Pan Shihao, Tian Heqing, Wu Jichun, and others attended as representatives to discuss the matter. Both parties hoped that the quota could be regulated and insisted that trade associations should proceed with caution. According to this conversation, the contract between the importer and the fixed customer, which originally required the trade association to which the fixed customer belonged to sign and certify, will now be countersigned by the Review Committee. The application and fixed-price contract accumulated in the Allocation Department, which has not yet been reviewed and completed, will also be subject to this regulation. How to make a reasonable allocation for foreign factories and commercial firms was also discussed yesterday, but no concrete decision was made. According to sources familiar with the matter, some commercial associations often carelessly sign and certify for their members, allowing them to enter into contracts and place orders with import firms. The allocation cannot be discussed, and there is no investigation into how many fixed orders have already been certified and what the content is. The competent authorities are deeply concerned about this. Yesterday's discussion was clearly related to this. After the representatives left, they convened 45 industrial and commercial associations related to the allocation of chemical raw materials at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM that afternoon. The Review Committee prepared a list of allocation rates based on the declarations of each association, which was passed on the spot, and an agreement was reached. A few associations that had submitted supplementary declarations earlier were not listed and will be slightly revised. The Chemical Raw Materials Commercial Association also sent representatives to attend, but there was no concrete way to participate in the allocation. The Review Committee proposed a ratio of 10 to 1, so that it could obtain 1/10 of the total quota to sell to industries in the vicinity of the city, but no agreement was reached. According to an authoritative person, the quota allocation of industrial raw materials should focus on supporting industry. North China, South China, and Central China also have separate quotas. The quota obtained by distributors here is used to assist neighboring provinces and cities. In terms of the current situation of the chemical industry, the ratio of 10 to 1 is still considerable. However, the commercial association expressed difficulty due to the large number of members and will negotiate again in the next few days. In addition, an agreement has been reached with the commercial association on the bark glue used by the leather industry. Because it is also needed for indigenous leather making in the interior, it is said that the allocation ratio has been set at 8/10 and 2/10.

### Hua Shares Rise Unabated, Yong Sha Particularly Profitable

Yesterday, buyers of Hua shares were concentrated in Yong Sha, not as much as others. Small-cap shares were particularly weak except for Zhongfa, which had its own absorption, and retreated instead of advancing. Yong Sha reached its limit very early. After several struggles, it finally traded at a premium. Before Yong Sha's capital increase, people had high expectations, and the trend was very profitable.

At the opening in the morning, people were in good spirits and opened high. After Yong Sha opened, it went from No. 108, No. 154, No. 31, No. 56 to 10400 yuan. No. 105, No. 94, No. 134, No. 142, No. 89 were sold at around 10250 yuan. No. 141, No. 160, No. 89, No. 112, No. 183, No. 35, No. 163, No. 56 all advanced, and the market was very bullish. Yong Sha first rose to the limit, followed by Yonggong, which also rose to the limit. Yong Sha then quickly rose to the limit, and No. 91 and No. 1 rose to 10700 yuan. No. 224, No. 232, No. 102, No. 231 were sold at around 10450 yuan. No. 117 and No. 78 advanced to the limit again. No. 224, No. 223, No. 91, No. 2, No. 218, No. 232 were sold, and it was inevitable that the rise would slow down. Tongyi rose to the limit. Afterwards, small-cap shares such as Ruofeng, Xin, Jingfu, etc. reached their peak and declined. Yong Sha continued to rise, conducting market transactions. Numbers 89, 85, 60, 191, 102, 224, 36, 104, and 152 all came to make up for the transfer. The black market called high to 10950 yuan. Letters and Harmony were bought up, arousing a strong reaction. Numbers 157, 224, and 228 were once sold within 10800 yuan. Cement rose to the limit. Numbers 223, 226, and 102 had even stronger buying interest. At the close, it rose to about 11250 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Finally, it ended outside 11200 yuan. Zhongsi once forced a limit up before closing. Xinya closed at the limit. Compared with last Saturday, Yong Sha reached the limit, as did Yonggong. Xinya and Meiya each rose by about 10%. Zhongfa rose by about 15%.

Room 360 took the opportunity to close out and then fell back to close at 7600 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, Class A and B fell slightly by 200 yuan, Unified Class C rose by only 100 yuan, Unified Class D fell by 100 yuan, and Unified Class E was flat.

Guang Gang and Bank Gang bought in, and finally hovered around 85,000 yuan. Hong Kong quotations shrank slightly, and the process was uncertain. Compared to last Saturday, estimated gauze Jardine Matheson, Wheelock and Guangwei rose slightly, Paper fell slightly, and the rest were flat.

### Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth All Show Strong Profitability

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw limited sales from yarn mills and little release from other traders. The market atmosphere was initially stable, but later, various parties searched for goods eagerly, and traders held back, reducing prices sharply. As a result, 42-count gauze rose to 20 million yuan, a sharp increase of 1.1 million yuan compared to last week. 20-count Double Horse yarn was 12.4 million yuan, an increase of 1 million yuan. Double Horse yarn rose by 800,000 yuan to 10.9 million yuan. The remaining 32-count Blue Bell, Silver Moon, and 20-count Tiannu Ren Zhong, 16-count Guangming Red Bee, and 10-count Boy Scout all increased by 300,000 to 700,000 or 800,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the cloth market saw retail investors buying and traders pushing up prices, resulting in a consistently strong market in the morning. 12-pound starter cloth rose to 457,000 yuan, Wufu to 419,000 yuan, and 3A Rainbow Ball to 400,900 yuan. Each thin cloth rose by a large amount of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to Saturday. The Yangtze River gang made inroads into Yuangfeng and Zhigong cloth.

The prices of Shilin cloth and other factory goods continued to be adjusted, with increases of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The markets for other coarse cloth, blue cloth, Yuan oblique poplin, etc., were consistently strong.

Yesterday's spot cotton market was calm in the morning and suddenly tightened in the afternoon. In the market, cotton yarn rose again, and people were excited. The silver root was loosened, and transactions were quite active. Yarn mills had strong demand, and customer gangs also added to their positions, so Ling Sai cotton opened at 1.95 million and rose to 2.1 million in the afternoon, but few sales were made. Vendors still wanted to see the market outlook, and the results were strong. 1/16 Mittellin opened at a factory price of 2.42 million, Ling Sai at 1.94 million, 1.95 million to 2.1 million, and 2.15 million. The stock price was 2.13 million to 2.14 million for 7/5 Mittellin, 1.7 million for Dachung Jixirong, 1.7 million for Sanyuzhen, 1.84 million for Hanxi, 1.65 million for Hancu, 1.58 million for subgrade, 1.4 million for Chen Hankou Cuxirong, 1.9 million for Shashi, 1.84 million for Chong Shashi, and 285,000 to 300,000 for Zhoupu Zihua.

### Woolen Summer Goods Decline

Woolen summer goods such as feather yarn, pilot cloth, flannelette, white pique, and white Zhigong, etc., are flooded with factory shipments, and the actual sales days are few. In the middle of last week, the downstream was already gradually falling. Unexpectedly, because of the rising prices of all goods last week, summer woolen goods also soared by 20%. As a result, customer gangs buying appetite was even lower, while sellers wanted to take advantage of the shrinking sales season and also wanted to roll over and make autumn and winter goods, and yesterday the market did not fall in price, with an average decrease of about 10%.

### High-Quality White Japonica Rice Sees Slight Increase; Supply and Demand for Food Rice Are Balanced; Flour Continues to Decline Inland, Clearly Stable but Secretly Weak

Yesterday, a total of more than 4,800 stones of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. The south market rose first and then fell back. As a result, the high-quality goods of Japonica and Indica rice rose slightly, while the medium- and low-quality goods were fair. White Yuan rice was still slow to sell, and prices were generally weak. Medium- and low-quality Customer Yuan rice was seldom consulted. Supply and demand in the north market were balanced, with no significant ups and downs.

Flour opened in the morning with firm support from traders, but store demand was weak, and the inland market continued to decline, making it difficult to rise, and the market was clearly stable but secretly soft. The early market for foreign flour saw an increase of more than 1,000 yuan, but transactions suddenly weakened at noon. The inland market slightly advanced for wheat bran, rising by 21,000 yuan, and the market was in a rotation pattern. Soybean cake Shantou was moving to process, and Yingkou cake soared by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, and factory soybeans also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Yellow soybeans rose sharply with the rise of Shantou cakes, rising back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Green beans saw pick-up in the south, and stepped up by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while medium and low prices were flat. Adzuki beans were slow to sell and fell by another 10,000 yuan.

Red sorghum had little arrival and sales, and the market was temporarily stable. Corn also had little fluctuation. Sesame was procured by foreign traders, and the scarcity made it expensive, rising sharply and soaring by 20,000 yuan. Under the fierce purchase in southern China, raw peanuts rose sharply and soared by more than 20,000 yuan. Broad beans had slightly active customer sales, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat declined with the step down inland, and followed it weakly. Only small flour mills had slight transactions, and prices continued to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Fufeng and Fuxin had no intention to purchase.

Registration Required Before Buying and Selling Rice

Also reported: It is learned that in recent days, many large households and customers have secretly sold rice and grain, so the rice market has off-market transactions. If such things continue, accidents will inevitably occur. The municipal authorities and the rice industry association attach great importance to this. According to the person in charge of the rice market management committee yesterday: In the future, anyone who intends to sell rice and grain must apply to the market in advance for registration and must not arbitrarily buy and sell privately in the market and off-market.

Oil Extraction Method Has Been Decided

[Our newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau recently transported a batch of soybeans from the Northeast, totaling 2,300 tons, and it has been decided to entrust each member factory of the Oil Extraction Industry Association to extract oil.

The Central Trust Bureau will pay each factory a labor fee calculated at 20,000 yuan per dan of soybeans. The extracted oil will be allocated by the civil food allocation and the distribution method will be determined. The Central Trust Bureau will be responsible for selling. The method of selling soybean cake will be determined by the Central Trust Bureau.

### Buyers Search Actively, Rayon Price Soars, Factory-Managed Silk Goods Also See High Prices

Rayon prices have risen madly. The market was still stable yesterday morning. No. 210 Takayama Yusen opened at 27.4 million yuan, and closed at 8.2 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, because the silk factory gang had no rayon to distribute for the Lianying company's raw materials, they had to purchase them to weave, and they searched in the black market, resulting in unprecedented high prices. The fierceness of the rising wind made people stunned. In the afternoon, it rose to 9.8 million yuan, and finally reached a high of 30.5 million yuan for transactions. Dongyang and Tianqiao and others all rose by 3.8 million yuan compared to the weekend. 75th half light has a asking price of 40 million yuan, and the scarcity is a bargain. The rise is endless, and silk manufacturers are greatly affected.

Yesterday's factory market was also slightly firm and expensive. The D grade of 5 dan head with high uniformity had transactions, and the price was 33 million yuan. The E grade goods with a lower quality had a market price of 1.7 million yuan yesterday. Another dan of high-grade D grade goods was traded at 32.5 million yuan. Yesterday, dry warp also had transactions, and the additional dan price was 21 million yuan. The 5 dan head has not been opened, and the asking price has also been raised.

Dacheng quilt cover opened at 12.7 million yuan, and then rose by another 150,000 yuan. Huqiang quilt cover first had a transaction at 12.6 million yuan, and then rose to 7.5 million yuan. Da Cheng Gezi wall cloth was gradually falling out of favor, so it was unable to rise. Yesterday, the immediate price had a maximum of 41,800 yuan and a minimum of 1,200 yuan. It was also traded, and the final price was 1,400 yuan, with no significant ups and downs from the price last weekend. The deferred price was 1,600 yuan. Huajin crepe of rayon goods had no goods on the market in the afternoon due to the flying price of raw materials. The asking price was 28,000 yuan. The price of other goods remained unchanged due to very few transactions.

### Tung Oil and Pig Bristles Exports to be Handled by the Central Trust Bureau; Price Review Committee Established for All Matters

[Our Dispatch] In order to ensure a steady flow of tung oil and pig bristles exports, the government has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau (CTB) with the responsibility of purchasing and selling these two export commodities. Upon receiving this commission, the CTB has established a Price Review Committee within the bureau to determine the purchase and sale prices and quantities on a daily basis. The Export Promotion Committee has also appointed representatives to participate in the supervision of these purchase and sale matters. Regarding the purchase and sale methods, in addition to the CTB's head office purchasing from merchants and selling to exporters, its branches in various locations and overseas agents may also handle the transactions directly. Only exporters are eligible to purchase tung oil and pig bristles from the CTB, and payment must be made in foreign currency. Merchants and exporters engaged in the tung oil and pig bristles business should maintain close contact with the CTB's Barter Trade Department, which will make every effort to facilitate them. The above measures apply nationwide. The CTB and its branches in various locations have been ordered to implement purchases from merchants in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Chongqing, Wanxian, Changsha, and Wuzhou. Sales to export merchants will be conducted in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. However, the Tianjin and Guangzhou branches should first consult with the Shanghai head office when local merchants inquire about prices and other export-related matters, and the head office should respond as quickly as possible. Furthermore, the above measures are part of the government's plan to promote the export trade of seven major commodities. This plan has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Detailed measures for other commodities, besides tung oil and pig bristles, are currently being drafted by the relevant authorities. Once approved, they will also be implemented as soon as possible to break the current deadlock in export trade.

### Sugar Market Shows Fluctuations

Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat, with both increases and decreases. The Association's official quotation for No. 20 medium-grained white sugar was 590,000 yuan, then 586,000 yuan, up by over 10,000 yuan. Taiwan red sugar was 556,000 yuan, up by 6,000 yuan. Shantou Jieyang green sugar was 420,000 yuan to 425,000 yuan, up by 7,000 yuan. Cotton red sugar was 455,000 yuan to 463,000 yuan. "Diao Qing Zong" was 370,000 yuan to 375,000 yuan.

A total of over a hundred deals were concluded.

### Tea Market Shows Steady Sales; Wenzhou Mao Hong Tea Prices Firm

Yesterday's foreign firm tea market, although transactions were still limited, showed a trend of stability. As some exporters continued to inspect samples of "Chou Zhen" and "Zhen Mei" grades for sales to Africa, sentiment remained positive. Domestic sales of red and green tea were gradually increasing amidst the scorching sun. Wenzhou Mao Hong tea, and teas from Fengjing and Jiashan areas, were particularly in demand, with increasingly active transactions and prices considered strong.

Guangdong buyers' demand for top-grade white Gong chrysanthemum tea was unsteady. Due to sellers' attempts to raise prices, the situation reverted to its previous state and became quiet. According to industry insiders, this year's Wuyuan newly fried green tea was facing slow sales at the origin, while demand was still high. Therefore, merchants were dispatching personnel to the production area for transport. Consequently, the local tea market has also improved. It is reported that current production prices have been driven up to 450,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight). Overall, this situation suggests a potential upward trend in the future.

### Central Authorities Hope the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee Will Quickly Determine a Regulatory Plan; Governor Zhang of the National Bank Convened a Discussion Meeting Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Cotton yarn prices have been rising steadily in recent days. The central authorities are paying close attention to this situation. They believe that although the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee has convened several meetings since its establishment, a complete cotton yarn and cloth adjustment plan has yet to be produced. Given the current trend of cotton yarn prices, it is essential to establish a clear and decisive regulatory policy and implement it in the short term.

Yesterday afternoon at around 5:00 PM, Governor Zhang of the Central Bank specifically convened a discussion meeting with directors and supervisors of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association and members of the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee to resolve various difficulties and pending issues related to the implementation of the current cotton yarn adjustment policy. It is reported that the discussion resulted in a principled agreement on the following points:

(1) For the 60,000+ bales of foreign cotton allocated to various factories by the Head Office in April, May, and June of this year, and the 32,000+ pieces of cotton yarn produced, each factory should submit the details to the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee within one week. The purchase price will be standardized at 6,500,000 yuan per piece for 20-count yarn. (2) It was originally decided that the government would purchase half of the yarn spun from foreign cotton exceeding the quota in the first quarter. Now, it has been decided that the government will return half of the cotton payment already made by the factories, and provide interest based on market rates. Half of the cotton within the first quarter quota will be issued by the government to factories for processing on behalf of the government, and the government will pay the factories a reasonable processing fee and profit. For the second quarter's foreign cotton exceeding the quota, as few factories have made payments, the government has decided to return all of it. All of the foreign cotton within that quarter's quota will be issued by the government to factories for processing on behalf of the government.

In addition, issues such as how to determine the processing fee and how to comply with price agreements were also discussed. According to the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, its member factories have already submitted 8,000 bales of yarn for collective distribution, and they will be able to submit a total of 10,000 bales within days.

[Another Dispatch] The Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee originally scheduled a small group meeting on finished product transportation, sales, and pricing for yesterday morning. However, as several outstanding issues remained to be resolved in consultation with Governor Zhang of the National Bank, the meeting was postponed and will be held at 10:00 AM today. The fourth committee meeting will be held at 9:00 AM tomorrow.

### Soap Prices Rise with Increased Purchases

Yesterday, the soap market was lively at the opening, especially for Sunlight and Royal brands. It was reported that customers from Nanjing and Hangzhou were commissioning purchases, so buying interest was strong. There was also strong real demand in the market for Xiang Mao, Gu Ben, Arrow, Dao, Guang Hua, and other soaps. Coupled with speculative purchases from outside the industry, supplies were tight, and sellers were holding out for higher prices, causing prices to rise sharply. By the afternoon, Gu Ben soap had jumped to 500,500 yuan per case, Arrow soap to 495,000 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao to 338,000 yuan, and Guang Hua soap to 310,000 yuan. The prices of other soaps, such as Henry, Cow Brand, Sun & Moon, Ding Feng, etc., also rose by 5,000 to 16,000 or 17,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Head Office's Third Batch of Foreign Currency Allocation Methods Have Been Determined

[Our Dispatch] The Head Office's second batch of 100,079 bales of foreign cotton has arrived. The 10th committee meeting of the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Transportation Management Committee has determined the allocation method for this batch of foreign cotton to various factories, with reference to the foreign cotton quota for May to July in the second quarter of this year. The decision has been submitted to the Head Office for reference. The requirement that factories have 3,000 or more spindles remains a prerequisite for allocation. According to statistics, 85 yarn factories, including Shen Xin, in Shanghai and other areas, are eligible for allocation. Once they receive notification, they can contact the Head Office. China Textile Construction Company has the largest allocation, receiving 44,989.38 bales. Yong An Factories 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are second, receiving a total of 5,366.13 bales. Shen Xin Factory 9 is third, receiving 3,249.23 bales.

### Cigarette Market is Bullish

Yesterday, the cigarette market turned stable and bullish. This was because the prices of various public utilities were about to be adjusted, and cigarette taxes were also increasing. The factories' production costs were increasing, and factory prices were gradually rising, which stimulated strong buying in the market. Furthermore, out-of-town merchants temporarily stopped dumping inventory, leading to a shortage of supply and extremely high market sentiment.

Ten-pack Great Britain cigarettes opened at 7,600,000 yuan, then briefly fell, but soon buyers became active again, and prices reversed to show strength. The afternoon market was filled with buying interest, with demand exceeding supply, and prices rose steadily. In the end, ten-pack Great Britain cigarettes rose sharply by 400,000 yuan compared to the (Sunday) afternoon closing price, to 7,920,000 yuan. Old Knife cigarettes were 6,920,000 yuan, up by 370,000 yuan. Five-Flower and Hartmen cigarettes rose by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Ten-pack and twenty-pack Qianmen cigarettes from the Yi Zhong Company, and Da Nan Wei and Da San Pao cigarettes, were selling strongly, rising by 1,500 yuan to 2,600 yuan per carton. Chinese-made cigarettes such as Beauty, Golden Mouse, Bank, and Three Cats also mostly showed progress. American-made cigarettes such as Camel, Six Roots, Morris per carton, and 50-pack canned cigarettes, also showed firm stability.

### The Melancholy Envoy of Yan River Surveys the Flooding in Southern Guangxi

— Nanning, 1st (Airmail Dispatch) by Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong

Full of Melancholy and Ailing

For a whole month, Guangxi has been completely immersed in endless torrential rain. After one wave of sorrowful clouds, another wave of sorrowful clouds follows. Low pressure squeezes out countless cries of despair. The overwhelming flood, roaring and rushing, is like a wolf or a tiger. The river channels are broken for hundreds of miles, sweeping horizontally and vertically, from the North and South Pan Rivers all the way down to the Pearl River Delta. The land is vast and boundless, the fields and soil are submerged, burying countless lives and properties. The disaster of war in the north, and the natural disaster in the south. After the knives and guns, divine punishment follows one after another. Ordinary people can't survive! ....

In order to let our compatriots who share the suffering understand more thoroughly how nearly a million brothers and sisters are struggling and groaning beneath the floodwaters, the reporter walked out of Guilin in the pouring rain, and quietly sneaked into Liuzhou in the great wind and rain, and then headed towards the turbulent waters of the upper reaches of the Pearl River. The closer I got to the disaster area, the heavier my heart became.

From Guilin to Liuzhou, ever since the Guiliu section of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway was repaired, the road of over four hundred li could originally be reached from morning to evening. However, the roads and bridges, which were painstakingly repaired, could not withstand a great flood. If it's not this pontoon bridge that collapses today, it's that culvert that collapses tomorrow. This road has been compared to Lin Daiyu among railroads - full of melancholy and ailments. Therefore, train delays are not news; only when the train is on time will the newspapers publish a headline, "Today's Train Arrived on Time". When the reporter arrived in Liuzhou, he happened to encounter the Luorong Bridge being washed away by the flood. The train only went to Luorong'an (a small county town tens of li away from Liuzhou), and then transferred by ferry, pushed by another train into Liuzhou. The fact that a train has to "transfer by ferry" is hard to imagine.

The Northern Guangxi Plateau is Like a Mass Grave

The northern Guangxi plateau, man-made disasters outweigh the floods. Along the way, you can still see the rice seedlings in the fields growing well - in previous years, it would have been the time for the new grain to be harvested. The further down you go, the more you feel the thousands of desolate scenes pressing upon you step by step. Entering Liuzhou, it was near dusk. In the quiet rainy night, wandering on the streets, only the little beggars chasing behind you are many times more numerous than this time last year. Waking up early in the morning, walking on the streets, a group of "street angels" were quietly sleeping on the sidewalks, stretching from the Peixin Road intersection to the end of Peixin Road, three across, five vertically, broken bowls and bamboo tubes still tightly hugged in their arms, grinning, closing their eyes, looking like they were walking into a mass grave. Alas!

Small Town's Human Market Crying, Looking at Waterlogged Fields

The four surrounding villages are flooded, and pests are rampant. A famous small town north of Liuzhou has, until today, invisibly established an extremely lively human market. Farmers who have no way to escape the famine, unable to bear to let their families perish together, often prefer to sell all their children for around 150,000 yuan. Then, with the money, they pay off the debts borrowed for planting, and then, with a sorrowful look in their eyes, they look at the three-foot-deep waterlogged fields, which they spent their painstaking efforts on, and then move to the mountains to sit idly by, until the water recedes. Cutting out flesh to mend the wound, cannot even heal the sore in front of them. The scenes of the past two years are the same, but the people who have died in the past two years are already a different group.

My residence faces the Liu River. Before I finished writing a thousand-word draft, the river water had risen three times. The dockworkers endured the rain, sweating, adding layer upon layer to the floating bridge and gangplank of the big river, groaning and grunting. The "Meat Market" behind the house was also bargaining in a low voice. Occasionally, a burst of goosebump-inducing laughter would rise, only to be immediately drowned out by the torrential rain.

Traveling from Liuzhou to Nanning, is just a matter of one day. Using one day's time to move one's gaze over the road full of scars, truly makes one think infinitely. One year's time, good things have not gotten better, but bad things have gotten worse. From the overflowing of the Pearl River, to seeing the suffering of the people, the sights and scenes are not enough for outsiders to describe. "New ghosts are annoyed by grievances, old ghosts cry, the sky is cloudy and the rain is wet, the sound is chirping." Such a situation can be found in every corner of Guangxi.

Nine Counties in Southern Guangxi Flooded

Wandering on the banks of the Yong River, gazing at the piles of silt left behind after the flood receded, at this moment, I don't know if I hate or resent, but I feel a yellow water in my eyes, a string of sighs in my ears, and a burst of desperate calls in my mind. In six days, in a cursory survey of the disaster, I traveled through nine counties in southern Guangxi - Binyang, Nanning, Wuming, Guode, Longan, Tongzheng, Hengxian, Yongchun - unexpectedly feeling an inexplicable terror towards the滔滔 flood. As a result of the torrential rain for months, more than half of the rice stalks that were about to ripen in the above-mentioned areas were drowned to death, totaling no less than 500,000 mu. Stepping through the fields, watching the new grains lying down and moldy in field after field, there is truly indescribable sorrow and pain. Guode, Zhenjie and other places are extremely barren - in that county, except for the county government, the council, and the health department which are built of brick and tile, the entire "main street" is covered with thatch - this time the flood happened just as the new grain was ripening and the corn was bearing fruit. A flash flood broke out, and all the hard work planted against the mountain was turned to nothing. Pressed by the big river, besieged by mountains and rivers, until not a single grain was left. Farmers rushed to escape, many on the verge of death. The number of victims is more than 500,000, most of whom are homeless and starving. However, the relevant parties, those who should be eager to rescue the drowning, have not yet taken any action, resulting in the price of rice in Yongyuan once soaring to 270,000 yuan per hundred catties, setting a Guangxi rice price record. At present, the flood is gradually receding, and the people who have lost everything have returned to the fields. Gritting their teeth, they use a 1-to-2 "grain flower" - a high-interest loan, borrowing one dan of grain and returning two to three dan at harvest - to sow seeds in the fields, betting on fate once again. Near Shuangqiao in Wuming, I saw farmers busy transplanting seedlings. I happened to ask an old man who was pulling a plow with all his strength, whether the rice fields next to him were "second crop"! - that is, after the first harvest, continue to transplant rice seedlings for a second harvest in September and October. - The old fellow answered with humor and pain, saying: "The second crop is the second crop, but unfortunately the first crop was harvested by the heavenly soldiers!"

Girls for Sale, Red Thread Around the Neck

Guangxi's land is barren, and the people have long been bitter. Adding on these thousands of disasters and hundreds of difficulties, it is simply exhausting their blood and tears. On the road of Yong, I don't know how many women I saw, bare-chested, wearing tattered underwear, squatting in the fields to work, their whole bodies tanned into a lump of charcoal. If it weren't for a head of "dark clouds" and two breasts, it would be hard to know that they were some women who were so poor that they had nothing left. However, among these people who barely have time to take care of themselves, there are often some "parent officials" who are eager to establish their own "visible" "achievements." So, today they pull a group of people to repair the county road, tomorrow they pull a group of people to build some inexplicable water conservancy project, (such as in Sile County, in order to build a fire road directly to the Vietnamese border, they do not hesitate to gather the strongest men to start construction when farming is busy), causing farmers to lose their plows and harrows, pick up hoes, and run around exhaustedly, but they can't come up with a reason. The fields are barren, and the tribute to the officials is endless. Therefore, those who are in difficulty are more and more in difficulty. In Tongzheng, Funan, and other places, groups of people sell their children. Each one is calculated by age, about 15,000 to 20,000 yuan per year. A big girl of seventeen or eighteen can be had for 300,000 yuan.

When I arrived in Guode, I saw many girls sitting on the ground in the street with red threads around their necks. When I got closer, I thought it was a kind of decoration. Who knew that after asking, this red thread was originally the mark of the "commodity," with the highest price being 300 catties.

The Disaster is Most Tragic in Guode and Other Counties

The exact number of disaster situations, to this day, no one has figured out. The water receded, and after a heavy rain, the new flooding started again, rising and falling. It is said that it will not be stable until after the Mid-Autumn Festival. No one dares to guarantee what will happen in the next three months. At the moment, various places are starting to closely investigate the detailed number of losses, preparing to request emergency relief. According to the reporter's general investigation, the disaster situation should be most tragic in Guode, Zhenbian, Jingxi, and Pingzhi counties. The population of Guode county is less than 60,000, but the number of people who "see grass roots instead of rice" has reached more than 30,700. All the shifting cultivation fields were washed away, and there is no hope of harvest. In more than 20 townships, such as the northwest and southern slopes of Jingxi, there are more than 30,000 starving people. In a place called Pingwen Township, the most unstable situation is that the entire township has entered the mountains to cut betel nut trees and loquat leaves to satisfy their hunger. No less than thousands of trees have been felled, and there are daily reports of people falling to their deaths in the valleys due to exhaustion from cutting trees. There were also seven children who dug up a pile of cassava, happily burned it to eat, but before they could finish eating, they all died of poisoning. In Zhenbian County, the number of victims also exceeded 30,000. The harvest of the entire county is less than 10%, and people live on algae and pigweed. In Sanpeng Township, which belongs to the county, up to 12 people committed suicide in one day because they could not endure hunger. In Zhenjie County, the number of victims also reached 20,000, and more than half of the miscellaneous grains were washed away by the water. They received 3 million yuan in relief funds, which is about 140 yuan per person. In Longshan County, all seven townships attached to the county seat were submerged, and the number of starving people quickly increased to more than 8,000 households. 40,000 people stretched out their hands for help, and 36,000 mu of land were all lost, to the point that there was money but no rice to buy, and some people had nowhere to escape. Extending to Pingzhi, Tiandong and other counties, there were fields of water everywhere, and land that was not submerged. The common people ate all the grass roots, then ate mountain potatoes, and after eating all the mountain potatoes, they ate the bark of kapok trees. After eating all the tree bark, they ate the roots of kapok trees. If they were lucky enough to occasionally dig up a few bamboo shoots, it was a great meal. Driven by hunger, they often formed groups to steal peanut sprouts and miscellaneous grains from the shifting cultivation fields that were not flooded to satisfy their hunger, but they were shot at by the guards occupying the mountains. Such tragic incidents occurred countless times in the areas where the three counties of Tiandong, Pingzhi, and Guode meet.

From Yongning down the river, the villages along the river in Yongchun and Hengxian were also reached by the God of Waves. In Pumiao Township, more than 10,000 mu of sugarcane, peanuts and miscellaneous grains were flooded. The losses in various townships of Hengxian, such as Jiangkou and Nanxiang, also reached more than 50,000 mu. Down to Nanjiang in Guixian County, which was originally the only sugar-producing area in Guangxi, most of the sugarcane fields have now been submerged due to the disaster. Those that have not been submerged have also suffered irreparable damage due to prolonged rains and pests. How farmers will make a living this year is simply unbearable to ask!

Cutting Flesh to Heal Sores; Grievances Difficult to Resolve

Before the disaster, there were grain storage facilities in various places to deal with emergencies. However, most of them were in the hands of local tyrants and gentry for no reason when the people were waiting for rice. The grains that were supposed to save the people from water and fire were used to save their own pockets. The high-interest loan trick, which could not be higher, was played out by these people. For a debt of 20,000 yuan, they want one dan of grain in September. The common people have no choice but to cut flesh to heal sores, taking the grain they usually send in for storage, but they have to pay ten times the interest. It is truly unknown where to start talking about such grievances! As for those emergency relief teams that acted in previous years, they have now become a relic of the past in Guangxi, which also makes the refugees feel that "there is no trace of compassion in the world". However, these are all small things. When the water level of the West River was at its highest, it reached 80 meters. The water has receded slightly in recent days, and it is unlikely that it will cause further harm, so prices have fallen in recent days, especially the price of rice in Nanning, which has fallen from 260,000 to 140,000 yuan at the highest speed of decline. Therefore, people's hearts have also become more stable, although the gangsters in the 100,000 Mountains, who are always suspicious, are constantly threatening this empty land (the so-called Democratic Allied Army based in Lingshan Guode recently infiltrated the Shuichun area of Quan County, creating a tense situation).

Looking at this flood, the situation in the upper reaches of the Pearl River is not necessarily worse than the disaster in the lower reaches of the delta. The only difference is that one is the first to bear the brunt and the other is the culmination of disasters. It is natural that a hundred measures to treat the symptoms will not get rid of the word "money". The work of treating the root cause needs to be discussed further. To give one example, the reporter drove between Gui and Yong, for more than 1,000 li. Counting, he lingered among the mountains, and all he saw was bare, barren land. From Liuzhou to Qianjiang, a distance of 200 kilometers, only one tung oil tree was found, which is truly a "rare sight of trees". It is up to people to prevent disasters, it is not enough to shout slogans. What's more, the common people have so many things they can't say.

### Sir Alexander Paterson Speaks on: The New Type of Prison

— Reuter's Dispatch from Leiden, June 24th, Sent to Shanghai

Sir Alexander Paterson, who pioneered the world's most modern prison at Ley-hill in England, has traveled extensively to study prisons. He recently published new insights on prison reform. The key points are introduced below: The essence of long-term imprisonment is, firstly, to serve as a deterrent, so that those who are subjected to it deeply reflect and dare not re-offend. Secondly, it addresses the concern that the effect of short-term imprisonment is too weak, and it is necessary to extend the years of confinement in order to improve the person's heart and mind. However, those who are sentenced to long-term imprisonment can be divided into two categories in terms of their character. The first category includes thieves and other habitual criminals. The second category includes political prisoners or those who committed manslaughter on impulse. These people are not accustomed to committing crimes, but act out of circumstance or necessity, committing occasional errors. Most countries' prisons, due to outdated laws, often confine these two fundamentally different types of long-term offenders together without distinction. The British authorities, recognizing this, have begun to specially separate criminals who have accidentally fallen into the legal net and use new methods of confinement. Firstly, they prevent them from coming into contact with "habitual criminals." Secondly, they are given considerable freedom, each assuming a certain degree of trust and responsibility, allowing them to stay within a defined area under minimal supervision without strict confinement. They are allowed to talk and laugh with each other and are exempted from all strict regulations. They are provided with recreational activities such as books, newspapers, movies, music, and theater. They are given work or study that suits their individual nature, abilities, intelligence, and age, with a set timeframe to observe their progress. This is supplemented by beneficial physical outdoor exercise and opportunities to balance their mental and physical strength during work breaks. Those responsible for supervision are no longer ordinary prison guards but are replaced by trained and highly educated personnel. This is because the application of intimidation in the old-style prisons is insufficient to improve the character of criminals, and may even degrade them. Prison authorities in all countries are well aware of this experience. However, there is still a danger that can be easily encountered when implementing this new method. This means that if prison officials occasionally fail to inspect, one or two habitual criminals may inevitably enter the facility, causing the initial attempt to promote and implement this new approach to be destroyed.

In ancient times, defeated heroes and villains became war criminals and were confined to islands to spend their lives. How much better would it be for those less severe cases to replace imprisonment with island residency, and shackles with observation. With no way to escape, the cost to those defending would not be high. This is a well considered plan. If we want to nurture the character of long-term or permanently imprisoned scholars, allow them reasonable freedom of movement, benefit the people economically, and make a satisfactory contribution with their abilities, nothing is better than selecting an island surrounded by water. Establish key defenses and provide all necessary facilities for healthcare and livelihood, and relocate them there. This could solve the problems that most criminals pose and address the extreme shortage of talent in China. It would be better than the imperial examination system, encouraging them to atone for their crimes by contributing their abilities, requiring them to submit their work on time. If the Chinese value these insights from the British gentleman, it would not only bring about intangible education for turning over a new leaf and reforming oneself, but also achieve tangible economic benefits by avoiding idleness and wasted resources. These two accomplishments would be remarkable. It would benefit the government and the people in terms of people's livelihoods and national economy, creating a completely new situation. Perhaps there would be unexpected gains that people cannot even dream of. Not only could internal strife be quelled, but someone might devise ingenious plans, and even in the face of resource scarcity, a new village could be found on a dead end road. As for the regulations on redeeming sins through merit, how they should be stipulated to align with both reason and sentiment, the country is not short of legal experts representing public opinion, who will naturally handle the matter well, so there is no need for the reporter to offer further advice.

### The Current Situation of Partitioning India and Pakistan

— Reuter's Dispatch from New Delhi, June 28th, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Zhou Xiangguang

In early May, I wrote a dispatch pointing out that the partition of India and Pakistan was inevitable. Only a month later, the partition of India and Pakistan has begun. The British government's statement on June 3rd to return power to India is the Magna Carta of the partition of India and Pakistan. The five key points of the Magna Carta are as follows:

Key Points of the Charter

(1) On February 20th of this year, the British government declared that it would return power to India in June 1948. It originally hoped that the various political parties in India could jointly draft a constitution according to the British parliamentary delegation's plan and establish a unified India. This wish has now become a bubble.

(2) At present, the Constituent Assembly, in provinces where the Muslim League has a majority, such as Bengal, Punjab, Sindh, and British Balochistan, has not sent representatives to attend. It is feared that the constitution determined by the assembly in the future will not be adopted by the aforementioned provinces. To respect the public opinion of the region, whether they join the current Constituent Assembly or another constitutional body should be decided by the people of each province themselves.

(3) Once one or more regimes are produced by the above methods, the British government will grant Indians the status of dominion within this year.

(4) Regarding the two provinces of Bengal and Punjab, where the number of Hindus and Muslims is roughly equal, their provincial assemblies should be divided into two units, one representing the provinces where Muslims are in the majority, and the other composed of representatives from the remaining counties. These two units should meet separately. If either side votes in favor of partition, then the province should be partitioned.

(5) The Northwest Frontier Province should hold another referendum.

All Parties Agree

When this new plan was proposed that day, the Indian National Congress, the Muslim League, and the Sikh community, under the pressure of the environment, agreed to accept it. Therefore, after the Governor-General of India broadcast the above plan on the evening of June 3rd, a conference was held with speeches by leaders of various parties. First, Mr. Nehru, the representative of the National Congress, explained: "Unity cannot be forced, partition is the mother of union." His words were poignant and moving. Next, Mr. Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League, explained: "Although this plan does not fully meet our original wishes, it is necessary to negotiate. However, whether the Muslim League is willing to accept it still awaits the final approval of the Muslim League Executive Committee. At present, we hope that Indians and Pakistanis will live together peacefully and avoid any disputes." His words were calm and profound. Finally, Mr. Baldev Singh, the Sikh representative and Minister of Defense of the interim government, explained: "The partition of India will not last long, and cooperation will still be necessary in the future," placing endless hope on the future of India.

The four-thousand-year-old ancient country of India has since been divided into two countries, one being Hindustan (the National Congress is unwilling to use this name and retains the name India) and the other being Pakistan (meaning the holy land of Islam). From June 3rd to today (June 44th), Bengal and Punjab provinces have been divided. East Bengal belongs to East Pakistan, West Punjab belongs to West Pakistan. What has not yet been decided is the Sylhet district of Assam, which is adjacent to East Bengal and is a majority-Assamese area. A vote must be held on whether to join Pakistan or Hindustan. However, in my opinion, the district will undoubtedly belong to East Pakistan. The vote is just a formality.

What India and Pakistan are most concerned about is the referendum in the Northwest Frontier Province. This will be discussed later.

Avoiding Bloodshed

I have already said that Jinnah still needs to submit the new plan to the Muslim League Executive Committee for discussion on whether to agree to accept it. In fact, Jinnah is the dictator of the Muslim League. If he says yes, everyone says yes; if he says no, everyone says no. This is what those of us in India know. Because the senior members of the Muslim League, such as Finance Minister Ali Khan, were all promoted by him. Jinnah is now seventy-two years old. He and Nehru's father are old friends. No one dares to oppose what he does. The ability of the Muslim League to unify is perhaps one reason for this. However, the senior members of the National Congress are all old friends, so they must discuss important matters together. Nehru is not a person who actually wields power in the National Congress. The Muslim League held a meeting at the Imperial Hotel in New Delhi on June 10th, attended by more than 400 people, and unanimously passed the resolution to accept the new plan and authorized Jinnah to handle and deal with everything in the future. When Jinnah presided over the meeting, thousands of Muslims shouted: "Supreme Leader Jinnah is the Shahan-Shar (Emperor) of Pakistan!" When the old man Jinnah heard this, he felt uncomfortable and said, "I am not an emperor, I am an old soldier of Pakistan!" This was also an interesting anecdote at the meeting, adding much color.

Following the Muslim League, the National Congress Party held an Executive Committee meeting on June 15th to discuss the issue of accepting the new plan. All the leaders of the National Congress Party were present that day, including Gandhi. After a fierce debate, the congress passed the resolution with a majority of 157 votes to 29 votes. The most important point in the reasons for accepting was that it is better to split up in order to seek peace than to force unity and see the tragedy of sectarian bloodshed again. This is something we should admire. The National Congress Party has always advocated independence, peace (non-violence), and unity. Now, sacrificing unity in order to achieve independence as soon as possible and hoping for peace to appear sooner shows their painstaking efforts to tolerate each other for the sake of the country. This is of course also possible because the Muslim League does not have a million-strong army.

This new plan of the British government has now been agreed to by the two major political parties in India. Strangely enough, the die-hard conservative Churchill also agreed to it. He gave a speech at the East India Association in London on June 11th, believing that the British Labour government's policy towards India "is entirely correct in general!" He later praised Governor-General Mountbatten, saying that he had made great contributions in India, and that this great contribution also belonged to the person who sent him as Governor-General! This time, old Churchill was indeed being reasonable, unlike before, when the government said what was right, he would definitely say what was wrong, and when the government said what was wrong, he would definitely say what was right, with that kind of die-hard mentality.

Northwest Frontier Province

Now we need to talk about the Northwest Frontier Province. Approximately nine out of ten people in the Northwest Frontier Province are Muslims, but the cabinet is controlled by the National Congress Party. Moreover, because of property restrictions, very few people in India have the right to vote. Therefore, during last year's general election, under the command of the National Congress Party cabinet, they won the victory. The Muslim League is not reconciled to the Northwest Frontier Province's willingness to follow Hindustan. Therefore, since this year, bloodshed incidents have continued to occur in the Northwest Frontier Province. Nehru was also stoned by the local people in the Northwest Frontier Province, resulting in a bloody head injury. Therefore, in the new plan, the British proposed to hold another referendum. This point is beneficial to the Muslim League. However, the National Congress Party knows that the Muslim League will win if there is a referendum. Therefore, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (referred to as Frontier Gandhi), the Muslim leader of the National Congress Party in the Northwest Frontier Province, advocates that a Pashtunistan should be established in the Northwest Frontier Province, which does not belong to Hindustan or Pakistan, but is an independent country. This point is to divide the Northwest Frontier Province again, like the Bengal Province. Jinnah is naturally unwilling to do this. When bloodshed incidents occurred in the Northwest Frontier Province, all Hindus and Sikhs left the province. The Muslim League did not invite these people to return to participate in the referendum. At the same time, Jinnah has sent his senior staff member Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, who is currently the Minister of Commerce of the interim government, to the Frontier Province to plan everything. Jinnah will also go to the referendum. Judging from this, the Muslim League will definitely not rest until it obtains the Northwest Frontier Province. In my opinion, the Northwest Frontier Province will definitely belong to Pakistan. However, the Muslim League will have to put in a lot of effort.

The Future of the Princely States

Now that India has been partitioned, what will happen to the 506 princely states within India? Because after the British government returns power to the Indians, it will also renounce its privileges over the Indian princely states, and thereafter each princely state will have full freedom to decide its own future. Therefore, the princely states that were hesitant in the past were forced to take the following three paths: (1) Join the National Congress's Constituent Assembly, (2) Prepare to join Pakistan's Constituent Assembly, (3) Declare independence. According to recent observations, several large princely states have decided their own future. For example, the Mysore princely state has joined the National Congress's Constituent Assembly, Hyderabad and Travancore have declared their own independence, but the Jammu and Kashmir princely state has not yet decided, because the majority of the people in that state are Muslims, but the ruler is a Hindu. In the future, it may join Pakistan's Constituent Assembly. But at present, the National Congress Party and the Muslim League are unanimously appealing to the Governor-General to allow the princely states to act freely, which is not without danger. Therefore, in the future, the princely states will inevitably move towards the path of the Constituent Assembly, and perhaps the princely states will gradually disappear from then on.

After the Muslim League obtained the status of the Dominion of Pakistan, it actively carried out the establishment of the government. The Muslim League has decided to choose Karachi, the capital of Sindh Province, as the capital of Pakistan. The capital of East Pakistan has not yet been selected, but it will probably be selected from either Chittagong or Dhaka. The personnel of the various departments of the central government are also being divided. All central officials should immediately fill out forms stating whether they wish to serve in the Hindustan or Pakistan government. According to current statistics, almost 99% of the central government's Muslims wish to go to Pakistan. Other items such as military borders, finance, and transportation have also established small committees to plan the division.

French and Portuguese Territories

Although the mainland of India is said to be a British territory, in reality there are still several places that belong to Portugal and France. Therefore, seeing that the British were returning power to the Indians, the Governor-General of French India, Métrac, also hosted reporters in Pondicherry, the capital of French India, on the 6th of this month, foreshadowing that there would be important administrative reforms in French territories. He said, "The ruling mechanism of French India naturally belongs to the local people." He also said, "I and the French Minister to India, Ross, visited Nehru and reported to Mr. Nehru on the Indian-French cultural exchange and development plan. I said that France values the friendship of the great Indian nation and has no political or economic desires other than this. France's wish is to make Pondicherry, French territory, a place for Indian-French cultural communication." From then on, the future France has decided to return the French Indian territory to the Indians. However, Portuguese India Goa, the Portuguese government has declared that it will never return it to India, just as Portugal will never return Macau to China, which is truly a regrettable thing.

A Wonderful Analogy

India has been partitioned in this way. General Wavell once made a wonderful analogy to this. He said at the East India Association in London, "India is now suffering from the pain before childbirth. All births are unpleasant, especially when twins are born." One of these twins is called Pakistan, and the other is called Hindustan. The latter name is not recognized by the National Congress Party. But no matter what the name is, the twins are about to be born. According to Professor Tan Yunshan's analogy, India is suffering from prepartum pain, and China is suffering from postpartum pain. In short, the prepartum and postpartum pains are both equally severe. We hope that like all childbirths, the pain will be short-lived, and then we will celebrate!

### A Look Ahead to the Revival of the Shipping Industry

— Zhou Jian

Throughout history, when a nation is in poverty, it seeks refuge in the mountains; when it develops, it relies on water. Our country is located to the west of the Pacific Ocean, with a coastline that winds and meanders for tens of thousands of miles. The residents along the coast are brave and enterprising. With such a geographical environment and national character, it is appropriate to traverse the seas and dominate the world. Unfortunately, the benefits of water have not been fully utilized in the past, so the tools for a prosperous life are not complete, and the strength to defend against insults is not sufficient. For decades, we have been subjected to external oppression, and the people's livelihood has been declining. The national power has been weakened!

Now that the War of Resistance has been won, maritime rights have been restored. After surviving a hundred disasters, we are reflecting on the pain. Looking back on the past, there are still lingering fears. After the war, there are countless things to be done. My colleagues in the shipping industry, aware of the relationship between shipping and national fortune, and that transportation is the foundation of construction, have concentrated all their efforts to quickly restore the pre-war tonnage of ships and assist in repatriation transportation. During this period, we have experienced difficulties, but we have always been mindful of the expansion of shipping, the maintenance of shipping rights, the promotion of shipping cooperation, and the negotiation of Japanese reparations ships, and have strived to do our best. However, pushing the wheel through accumulated water is only the beginning. In the future, we must make continuous progress, and the shipping industry will surely flourish. What else is there to say?

The author has been away from Shanghai for nearly ten years. Last time I came to Shanghai to participate in the founding meeting of the Shipping Federation, the journey was filled with tens of thousands of miles of waves, sandpipers flying, and unparalleled beautiful rivers and mountains. But when I first arrived at the shores of Shanghai, what caught my eye was the huge ships of foreign countries, their flags waving, overlooking the river. Looking at the ships of our own country, I could not see any. What is national defense? Secondly, although the number of domestic merchant ships has now recovered to 800,000 tons, they are lined up along the Huangpu River, and the number is not small.

Shanghai will be the shipping center of our country, with the reputation of the great port of the East. Leaders of the shipping industry, with foresight, are striving to cooperate with their counterparts across the country in addition to their own business. One call, and all mountains respond, gathering heroes from all directions to seek common prosperity for ten thousand ships. This kind of enthusiasm and effort is worthy of our special joy and encouragement, and we extend our highest respect, and send endless hope for the future of the shipping industry!

Spring and Autumn

### On Cao Cao's Death: Historical Analysis (Part One)

— Tan Zheng

I remember when I was young, studying in a private school, I once saw a picture in a stone-printed, illustrated Three Character Classic titled "King Ji Assassinating His Brother." A person in ancient attire, holding a precious sword, was chasing and killing another person in similar attire in a grand hall. That image is still deeply etched in my mind. Later, I read in history books about legends such as "Tai Jia Slaying His Father" and "King Ji Slaying His Brother," and I assumed that such things happened in the ancient era, and there was nothing to be surprised about. However, later, I heard the arguments of many scholars who believed that such things were against the norm, harmful to morality and social order, so they strongly refuted them as heretical and absurd, advising people not to believe them. At that time, I also firmly believed that what the scholars said must be very reasonable.

Later, I read more historical records, and in them, I discovered two similar events: one was Cao Pi of the late Eastern Han Dynasty "killing his father as a son," and the other was Zhao Kuangyi of the early Song Dynasty "killing his brother as a younger brother." The latter is clearly recorded in various historical books, while the former was something I discovered after carefully reading the annotations to the "Records of the Three Kingdoms." I once wrote this discovery into the fifth act of my play "Ode to the Luo River Goddess." (This play was adapted into a Yue opera by a certain troupe led by a self-proclaimed progressive female performer, but I only found out about it more than a year after their performance. I don't regret my performance rights, but I regret that this major discovery of mine has never attracted people's attention.) After learning about these two events, I thought that since the relatively advanced Han and Song dynasties could have such things, why couldn't they have happened in the ancient Shang and Zhou dynasties? So I completely overturned my previous blind belief and thought that those were not absurd things at all.

In order to make everyone aware of my new discovery of "Cao Pi Slaying His Father" and to jointly enrich the evidence for my new discovery, I will quote some of the not-very-substantial evidence I relied on, for those who love to explore such issues to study together.

To know why Cao Pi wanted to slay his father, one must first understand the triangular relationship between him, his father Cao Cao, and his younger brother Cao Zhi. History tells us that Cao Cao had many sons: the eldest son Cao Ang died in the Zhang Xiu rebellion in Wancheng, the second son Cao Pi was a poet, the third son Cao Zhang was a brave general, the fourth son Cao Zhi was also a poet, and the deeds of the other sons are not worth mentioning. However, although they were both poets, Cao Zhi was honest and kind, while Cao Pi was cunning and treacherous, so the father liked Cao Zhi. Moreover, after Cao Pi snatched the Zhen family, Cao Cao's intended target in the conquest, his aversion to Cao Pi deepened; so after he was promoted to丞相 (Chancellor) and enfeoffed as Duke of Wei, he intended to make Cao Zhi his heir. However, the cunning Cao Pi plotted deeply and worked hard to undermine his brother, finally making Cao Zhi fall out of favor with Cao Cao, and Cao Pi was made heir. So before Cao Cao died, he had already leaped to become the deputy Chancellor. When Cao Cao went on an expedition, he stayed in the capital, with high authority over everything, and he didn't even respect his own father.

I don't know if Cao Cao understood Cao Pi's political conspiracy, but that time when he returned from Chang'an to Luoyang, he suddenly decided to change his heir to Cao Zhi. Because he was afraid that his power would not be a match for Cao Pi, he urgently summoned Cao Zhang, who was originally told to stay in Chang'an, to bring back a large army. Regarding these, there are texts as evidence in the Records of the Three Kingdoms and its annotations. The "Biography of Prince Wei of Rencheng, Cao Zhang" says:

When the Grand Ancestor returned east, he made Zhang the General Who Crosses Cavalry, staying in Chang'an. When the Grand Ancestor arrived in Luoyang, he fell ill and urgently summoned Zhang. When Zhang arrived, the Grand Ancestor died.

The annotation quotes the "Wei Strategy," saying:

When Zhang arrived, he said to the Marquis of Linzi, Cao Zhi: "The reason the Guang Prince summoned me was to make you the heir." Zhi said: "No! Have you not seen the Yuan family brothers?"

In these two passages, we can not only see that Cao Pi indeed had other political conspiracies, but even Cao Cao's sudden illness and sudden death are really suspicious. Why didn't he return to his old home in Qiao County after falling ill, (because there he had many of his retainers who could serve him,) but stayed in Luoyang? Cao Pi had been the heir for a long time, why did he want to change the heir at this time? Even if he wanted to change the heir, why did he have to summon Cao Zhang back before changing the heir? When we think about the above questions, we know that Cao Cao at this time was already in Cao Pi's net, completely lost his freedom, and only by summoning Cao Zhang with his army could he ensure his safety and implement his plan to depose and establish a new heir. But, unfortunately, he knew too late, not only could the deposition and establishment not be realized, but he also lost his life because of it. We can read again the "Basic Annals of Grand Ancestor" in the same book, which says:

In the first month of the spring of the twenty-fifth year of Jian'an, he arrived in Luoyang. Quan击斩 Guan Yu,斩其首 (Killed Guan Yu,斩其首). On 庚子 (gengzi day), the King died in Luoyang.

In this basic annal, the above text never mentions that Cao Cao was ill, and suddenly there is a sentence "The King died in Luoyang" at the end, becoming dying without illness, isn't it very strange? So I think the person who wrote the history must have had "a subtle criticism." We can read again the "Biography of Jia Kui," which quotes the "Wei Strategy," saying:

At that time, the Heir Apparent (Pi) was in Ye, and the Marquis of Yanling (Zhang) had not arrived, and the soldiers and civilians were quite distressed by the labor and services, and there were also illnesses and epidemics, so the army was in turmoil, and the officials were afraid that there would be changes in the world, so they did not announce the mourning. Da suggested that it was not permissible to keep it secret, so he announced the mourning, ordering everyone inside and outside to enter to mourn. After the mourning, everyone was settled and not allowed to move.

The biography then says:

At that time, the Marquis of Yanling, Zhang, was the General Who Crosses Cavalry, coming from Chang'an, and asked Kui where the coffin of the late king was? Da said sternly: "The Heir Apparent is in Ye, the state has a successor, the late king is resting, it is not appropriate for you, Marquis, to ask." So he escorted the coffin back to Ye. Emperor Wen ascended the throne as King, and because the tens of thousands of households in Ye County were in the capital and many were illegal, he made Kui the magistrate of Ye. More than a month later, he was transferred to be the Grand Administrator of Wei Commandery. When the army went on an expedition, he was again the Master Recorder and Libationer of the Chancellor.

From these two historical texts, Cao Pi never went to Luoyang from Cao Cao's illness to his death, but Jia Kui and others escorted the coffin back to Ye. Where was he at this time? And what was he doing? How can this not make people suspicious of him? So I dare to assume that Cao Cao's illness was probably not an external illness, and his death was not a natural death. As for his will that has been passed down to the present, it was either made by him before his death or forged by Cao Pi later. After Cao Cao died, Cao Pi succeeded as King of Wei, and in October of that year, he usurped the throne of the Han Dynasty, which Cao Cao did not want to do during his lifetime. So my guess is that Cao Cao probably heard about Cao Pi's political conspiracy outside, so he rushed back to Luoyang. Or he only discovered it after returning to Luoyang. If he wanted to eliminate this conspiracy, he could only implement the deposition and establishment of a new heir; if he wanted to implement the deposition and establishment, Cao Pi was already the Deputy Chancellor at that time, and he could not deal with him without force, so he urgently summoned Cao Zhang with his army to help. Unexpectedly, the news leaked out, and Cao Pi simply did it all in one go, removing Cao Cao as well. And he himself never showed his face, ostensibly not leaving Ye for a single step, in order to cut off people's suspicions. And Jia Kui was probably the executor of this conspiracy, so after the success, he was greatly appointed. Although this is just my speculation based on the above-mentioned texts, and has not been thoroughly researched, there is still much circumstantial evidence, and it is definitely not comparable to unfounded and baseless talk. Not long after Cao Cao's death, according to the "Zizhi Tongjian," Cao Pi treated his brothers in this way:

In the second month, on 丁卯 (dingmao day), King Wu was buried in Gaoling, and the king's younger brothers, the Marquis of Yanling, Zhang, and others, all went to their fiefs. The Supervising Envoy of Linzi, 邴均 (Bing Jun), hoping to know the Emperor's mind,奏 (Memorialized) that Marquis of Linzi, Zhi, was drunk and behaved arrogantly, coercing the envoy. The King (Pi) demoted Zhi to Marquis of Shouxian, and executed the Right Rectifier,丁儀 (Ding Yi) of the Pei State, and his younger brother, 董門侍郎(Dongmen Shilang), and their sons, all of whom were Zhi's partisans.

If Cao Cao had not wanted to change the heir to Cao Zhi before his death, why would the brothers harbor resentment and have to treat each other in this way? Even Cao Pi's treatment of Cao Zhang is recorded in the "Wei Strategy," which is quoted in the annotation to the "Biography of Prince Xian of Rencheng, Cao Zhang":

After the Heir Apparent succeeded to the throne, after the burial, he sent Zhang to his fief. At first, Zhang thought that he had been trusted and meritorious by the late king, and hoped to be授用 (entrusted with power) because of this, but when he heard that he should follow the例 (precedent) (referring to following the envoys to the fiefs), he was very unhappy and left without waiting to be sent.

This clearly proves that if Zhang had not left the capital, he would have been severely punished, fortunately he saw the opportunity and left quickly. In the third year of Huangchu, he was suddenly promoted to Prince of Rencheng, and he thought that Cao Pi no longer held a grudge, so he went to the capital in the fourth year of Huangchu (this biography), but unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived in the capital, he "died suddenly in his residence" (this biography). The so-called "died suddenly in his residence" is the same suspicious matter as Cao Cao's dying without illness. The annotation to this biography quotes the "Spring and Autumn Annals of the Wei Family," which also says:

At first, Zhang asked Zhu Shou if he would have different ambitions, so he sought to come to court but was not immediately seen, Zhang was angry and died suddenly.

The so-called "different ambitions" here clearly refers to the matter of returning to the capital on his father's orders, and the so-called "angry and died suddenly" is of course not dying a good death. From this, it can be seen that Cao Pi's dislike of Cao Zhang was even greater than his dislike of Cao Zhi, because he was in command of troops. So promoting him to Prince of Rencheng was a deliberate tactic, enticing him to enter the capital, and finally putting him to death.

The unnatural deaths of Cao Cao and his sons are clearly obvious facts, but what happened behind the scenes? Who was the mastermind? What was the matter about? What was the process? Then we still have to wait for high-level historical experts to explore and search, and then we can make a decision. What I am talking about here is just a few historical materials for a literary subject.

### Field Work Poetry

— Li Baifeng

(I)

Warfare has made me forget this homestead
The pool of autumn water beside the garden
Only the fish swim leisurely back and forth
Before the courtyard, two courtyards of flowers bloom unknowingly
The orchard with lush branches and leaves
Gradually greens and then yellows
The mountain islands still occasionally peek into this garden
Lizards perch on fig or grape vines
I have long been familiar with the beauty of the mountains
The mountains are also the same to me —

It seems that it rained last night
Because I see dewdrops on the grass
Shining in the sunlight
And the mountain stones are slippery
The growth of moss is even greater than before
The vegetable garden in front of the door is still plentiful
Pumpkins like old men resting under long vines
Eggplants are so plump that one loves them
Chilies have ripened from green to red
Spending all day with crops
Watching autumn come and go

(II)

In this unrenovated old courtyard
I have seen flowers bloom and fall all over the garden
I have seen reeds let white hair droop into the water
I have seen banana trees die and revive
Oh, the luxuriant growth of mixed trees…

Once autumn comes, the mountains separate the world further
All things return to a sleeping posture
I fear to see the ears of grain bent by the autumn wind
The trees tell me of the warmth of spring
From now on, the mountains bow to me
The ruthless years cannot carve on my face
Looking up, I only see prosperity and decay filling my eyes
New graves fill the green mountains all around
I don't understand why
A thousand years of moonlight is forever silent
Only the small stream flows in front of the cliff
Spreading the lament of eternal solitude

### Umbrella

— ·Luo Yingfeng·

Umbrellas float past the rainy days
Like a flock of painted fragrant butterflies —

Traveling in the rainy season
Growing on the damp soil
I opened my little paper umbrella
In the rain, I have a little sunny day
I hold my head high and run fearlessly
My steps are neat and firm
It is a bridge from rainy days to sunny days
Safely ferrying me to the other side of the sunny shore

When the residual drops of rain have dripped away
Then it is hidden in my forgotten corner

### Match

— Ying

In the cold night,
I struck a match
Watching it bloom into a
Small orange-red flower.

A small orange-red flower,
Flashes a moment of light,
A slight warmth,
An indescribable, intoxicating dream.

I think of that
Girl selling matches in the fairy tale,
In this little flower,
She found ethereal comfort.

One flower after another blooms and fades quickly,
Like a beach reflecting the彩霞 (colored clouds),
Gradually calming bubbles,
Leaving behind silent darkness.

### Shepherdess

— Segantini

Segantini (Giovani Segantini 1859-1899) was an orphan who lost his parents at a young age. At the age of eighteen, he was still herding sheep and feeding pigs for others. Because he loved painting by nature, he finally took his savings over the years to Milan and enrolled in art school. After learning a little basic painting, he returned to his hometown — the Alps — to continue self-study.

Because he loved nature and his works mostly took real life as their subject matter, he inadvertently became a respondent to the French Impressionist movement at the time. His style focuses on light, his colors are bright, and his brushstrokes are delicate and lively, showing a tendency to surpass various French Impressionist artists. Unfortunately, he "did not get what he wanted in life, and only many years after his death was he praised by historians as the pioneering representative of Italian Impressionism." Representative works include "Cultivation" and "Shepherdess," etc. (Liu Shi)

### Homecoming

— Jiang Xingyu

On these days of continuous rain, the loneliness of the journey was already enough to make me feel sad and worried; the poplar trees on both sides of the road used to be so dense that they could block the sky and prevent the sun from shining in, but now? I only occasionally see one or two sparsely distributed, where have those dense poplar trees gone! Where has that green shade gone!

When I returned to this dilapidated little city, I found everything to be quite unfamiliar to me, and even relatives and old friends were as sparse as the poplar trees on the road. Only then did I suddenly realize that I had been away from this little city for a whole eleven years.

The city is full of荒煙蔓草 (weeds and wild grass) and ruins, only those stone memorial arches that commend chaste women and martyrs still exist. Although this is a product of cannibalistic ethics, although each arch has a story that makes people tremble, I can only use it as the only landmark to identify directions and to imagine the former streets.

My old residence has long been a level ground, I don't know who planted some pumpkins on it. After all, there is no fertilizer in the rubble, and the stems and leaves of the pumpkins are pitifully thin, like a child born with congenital deficiency. If the land had consciousness, it would definitely talk to me as intimately as the old people, about the sorrow of parting, or the trivial matters of my childhood and youth. I clearly remember those peaceful years like well water. Under the碧紗窗 (green gauze window), I ground a pool of 松煙墨 (pine soot ink) and wrote Yan Zhenqing's "Eulogy to the Eastern Portrait" or the collection, I walked into the park along the soft dirt road. On the stone benches, male and female students were bowing their heads to read books, preparing for the upcoming semester exams. From them, I found my own shadow, the shadow of my lost, long-lost, and full of beautiful fantasies, and now, I am already a withered person. A student cast a surprised look at me. He might think I was a wandering traveler, a stranger who accidentally passed through the park in this small city. If he knew what I was thinking in my heart, he would definitely laugh at me as being 陳腐 (corny)!

The护城河 (moat) was gurgling, rhythmically hitting the embankments on both sides. A fisherman was using a huge net to catch fish, paying attention to every small bubble and vortex on the surface of the water. The moment the fishing net was pulled out of the water, his expression was tense. You don't need to look at the net, just look at the expression on his face to know his results, whether it is disappointment, indifference, or pleasure. Thinking for the fisherman, one naturally hopes that he can get more fish; thinking for the fish, one hopes that they can escape the terrible net. Isn't this also a contradiction? In fact, worrying about the fish is also superfluous. In the world, there are even more invisible nets! For example, the net of troubles, the net of fame and fortune, the net of lusts, all kinds of nets. It is very rare to not fall into them, or to know to climb out immediately if you fall into them.

After many buildings were destroyed, this city seemed even more寒傖 (shabby). Everyone chooses the shortest route to walk, so the distance is shortened. As for the distance between people, in comparison, not only has it not been shortened, but it is even further. A small city is like a small family, what one comes into contact with all day long are those limited familiar faces. In theory, one should be able to live harmoniously. However, what phenomena do I see? Pascal said: "Man is only a reed, the weakest thing in nature." Now I want to say: If the reeds must collide with each other, apart from breaking immediately and simultaneously, no other miracle will occur. People's fanaticism for wealth and their excessive austerity in life are no longer something I can understand. However, this is also good. Their souls have a home. They will no longer feel the emptiness of life, because wealth has become their new religion, their new God.

In remote places, the enjoyment and authority of a county magistrate makes me think of the ancient emperors. The citizens are afraid of眼泪 (tears), I have not failed to see it, but even more terrifying is the second generation that grows up in this environment. When they go to society in the future, they will definitely not know what is integrity and what is serving the people.

On the eve of my departure, the moonlight was exceptionally beautiful. Was it to give me a send-off party? Or to bless me? When will I return to my hometown to enjoy the moonlight again? It is difficult to predict this in this turbulent era.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 337

— Ye Jingfeng

That report, however, was a great masterpiece by Little Tiger, forwarded by the Tianjin office of the Northeast "Zhai Zi (bandit stronghold)":

"Respectfully submitted as a report; this humble person was separated from the captain in the Tianjin "Three No-Control Zone," venturing east and west, searching everywhere but unable to find him. This humble person is helpless, probing the Japanese dog military headquarters three times, without any results. Originally, this humble person and the captain were supposed to arrive in the Zhang×kou area on August 5th and 6th to meet up with more than 40 members of the Zhai Zi large team, could it be that the captain could not find this humble person and went ahead. This humble person has arrived in 平 (Ping, abbreviated of Beiping), and has no face to meet with the Commander-in-chief, so this person writes a few lines, reporting to you, even if it means going through boiling water and fire, this person will find the captain. This underling Xiao Hucheng stands at attention to report."

This report is not a code; because Little Tiger doesn't understand codes. The wonderful thing is that although it is not a code, it has the meaning of a code. Someone not in the know simply cannot understand it. I carefully reviewed this report and could see that Little Tiger probably spent a lot of effort on this report. Don't look down on his unpleasant writing, Little Tiger may not be able to write this wonderful but unpleasant text. This can be seen from two points: first, this report is not in Little Tiger's own handwriting. Although the handwriting is not good, it is ten times more regular than Little Tiger's "仙人一把抓 (A Sage Grabs a Handful)," futuristic art characters; each stroke, twelve minutes formal. The second point, this bovine-equine hybrid submission format and the paper of the report, are not ordinary letter paper, nor are they official document submission paper, but the状子 (petition) paper that ordinary people use to file lawsuits. In addition, a particularly large red-signed official seal was found. I don't know where it was sought from an antique paper shop dating back to the Kangxi era. This, presumably within the possible secret range, Little Tiger found a person with a little superficial knowledge to act as the sword-holder and temporary secretary, showing this skill.

"Again, I have to trouble you to make a trip," Mr. W said to me with a smile on his face, but with full of worry. The smile was because Mr. W saw me studying Little Tiger's 漯亮 (muddy and bright) report, and guessed all the points of my thinking.

"Going is not a problem; I'm just afraid that like the trip to Tianjin, there will be no results—a trip in vain." When I recalled the tragic death of Mr. Ding and the imprisonment of other comrades, I couldn't do my best, or give my efforts, even by half. "...The destination is of course Wanquan and Zhangbei; this section here, of course, will still use the "Number Fifteen" stance; but after crossing Kou?..." I clarified the route of departure and the problems on the road.

"Yes!" Mr. W turned his wise, worried eyes; "This section is of course most suitable to go out using the "Number Fifteen" type; otherwise, it will be difficult to move an inch... It will be easy again after crossing Kou, and I can arrange it properly for you. The difficulty lies in "how to cross the甫 (just) 口 (mouth, here refers to the pass)..." Mr. W also seemed to have been infected by Tsurumi; putting his hands behind his back, he walked back and forth in the room.

"What stage has the situation at Kou reached?" I had been out of touch with the current affairs intelligence for the last three or four days. Although "〇四" gave me a stack of intelligence copies, I haven't had time to look at them carefully.

絮语 (Chattering)

### Ding Mocun's Last Words

— Shilang

"Number 26" mega-traitor Ding Mocun was executed by firing squad. On his deathbed, he only said one sentence. He said, "I hope the government will be more lenient with traitors." The rebellious Ding did not fully express his opinion and fell in a pool of blood. We don't know how much meaning this sentence contains. If we are only speculating, then Ding Mocun, who killed countless people during the enemy puppet period, seems to have a sense of "injustice not redressed" regarding his death sentence.

Regarding traitors, people in Shanghai seem to be much more indifferent than before. They no longer care much whether they should be punished by law or should be forgiven; but at least, in this chaotic and uneasy psychological state, the dike of personal morality and character has long collapsed, and all the standards for weighing right and wrong in the past have become insignificant here.

And for a "觀　事仇" (watching things as enemies) traitor, or even a vividly countable villain, everyone seems not to be fussy about his past crimes.

— This is really a very terrifying tendency.

Betraying national interests, selling out the country, regardless of the reasons, should be punished. Even if the law one day forgives them, but in terms of private morality, a person without integrity and character should also be given appropriate punishment.

Otherwise, why are so many "learned and famous" traitors in history, who defected and humiliated the country, still being laughed at and scolded today?

### The Origin of the Seven-Day Week Naming

— West Wind

Why is Sunday called Sunday? What are the meanings of the names of the other seven days? I would like to give a simple introduction now:

日曜日 Sunday: Judging from the literal meaning, you will know that it means the day of the sun. The sun gives people light, warmth, vitality, and happiness. The ancients realized the power of the sun from drought and experienced the warmth of the sun in severe cold. The changes of cold and heat, day and night, made them feel the mystery and wonder of the sun even more. They believed that the sun was a god named Apollo, who drove a chariot with burning flames, constantly patrolling in space. They worshipped the sun. In fact, without the sun, there would be no world, no everything. Who would say it is inappropriate to name the first day of the week as the day of the sun?

月曜日 Monday: Originally Moonoday, as the name suggests, it can also be known as the "Day of the Moon". When the golden crow sets in the west and the moon rabbit rises in the east, the silver light pours all over the earth, and all things are comforted by her, and they all feel comfortable, smooth, tranquil, and peaceful. The moon goddess is a slender, gentle, elegant, and beautiful goddess named Diana. She rides in a silver-shimmering chariot, following Apollo around the world. Therefore, the "Day of the Moon" is also named as the second day of the week, following the "Day of the Sun".

火曜日 Tuesday: It means "Tyrs Day". Tyrs is a brave general under the mountain god. In order to conquer the cunning wolf Fenris and make the footsteps of the armored cat, the whiskers of the girl, the peak of the mountain, the whistling of the fish, the longing of the bear, and the saliva of the bird, the mountain god specially made a strange chain. Tyrs used this chain to capture the wolf spirit Fenris, but he also lost an arm as a result. To commemorate his glorious sacrifice, the third day of the week was named "Tyrs Day". In French, it is called Mardi, which commemorates Mars, a war god similar to Tyrs, with the same meaning.

水曜日 Wednesday: It is to commemorate the day of Odin, the first great god on the Scandinavian island. Odin lives in the Weilhalla Palace, which is inlaid with jewelry, gold and silver everywhere, and is magnificent and beautiful. Two crows are always standing on his shoulders. These are "field reporters" who collect news from the lower world for him, and they often send them to invite the warriors who died on the battlefield of Margeri to drink sweet wine leisurely and listen to them report the process of loyalty to the country and heroic sacrifice.

木曜日 Thursday: Is the day of "Thor". Thor is the god of strength in Scandinavia. He wears iron gloves and uses a pair of heavy hammers that no one can use as weapons. One day, the giant Thrym secretly stole it. The shameless bastard claimed that he would marry the goddess Freyja as a condition for returning the heavy hammer. Thor disguised himself as a goddess to ask for it. During the banquet, he ate a strong cow and eight salmon in one breath, which shocked Thrym. Thrym became a ghost under his hammer at this time. Although Thor is so powerful, there are still two things that he politely declines. He couldn't lift a kitten, a cat incarnated from the Midgarda Serpent that entangled the entire earth. He couldn't finish a horn of water, one end of which was connected to the sea. Thursday is "Power Day". This day's work will make you particularly satisfied. In fact, on Monday and Tuesday, people think that the two weeks have just begun, and their scattered hearts have not been recovered. On Friday and Saturday, they think that Sunday is coming, which leads to anxiety. Only on this day, the mood is collected and not released, and the will is concentrated. Naturally, it can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

金曜日 Friday is "Freyja's Day". She is the beautiful goddess who made Thrym coveted. Her husband, Odin, and her son, Thor, are both famous. Perhaps it is because of her husband's nobility and her son's glory that her fragrant name is named on the sixth day of the week. However, the Westerners all hate this unlucky day because it is the day of Jesus' crucifixion.

木曜日 Saturday is "Saturn's Day", commemorating the Roman agricultural god Saturn. Although he is a licentious, rude, and savage god, and even committed the atrocity of swallowing his own sons, he has made great contributions to mankind. Mankind depends entirely on his gift—grains, vegetables, melons, fruits, and animal husbandry. Therefore, even Saturn is named after him. And to this day, whether it is civil servants, employees, students, military police, or elegant individuals, they are all eagerly looking forward to the arrival of Saturday and Sunday.

### Explanation of "Election"

— Lu Shi

"Election" has long become a specialized term and is commonly used by Chinese people, but strictly speaking, the connotations of "selection" and "election" are completely different, and they are explained separately as follows.

"Selection" means to pick out a few people from many people, such as in the chapter "Li Yun" in the Book of Documents, "select the virtuous and capable". "Election" means that most people publicly recommend a few people to do things, such as in Han Xiao's "recommend the virtuous and upright".

Originally, there were two election methods. One is voting by all citizens (except for passive restrictions), which is usually called universal suffrage. The other is that the government sets candidates and stipulates that the elected person can only be generated from the list of candidates, which is generally called circle selection. In this way, the term universal suffrage should be revised to "universal election", while circle selection is "selection", because it selects first and then elects.

However, we do not advocate renaming the election in terms of words now, but we want to remind the people that before electing, they should carefully select the person they want to elect, which is the true spirit of democracy. Otherwise, if they are vague and manipulated by others, forming an election without selection, that kind of election is futile!

### Rectification of the Japanese Rectification Work

— Bao Qing

The Japanese government announced on June 27 the detailed measures for the final political purge, including the aspect of speech reporting and the organs for controlling speech. However, it is noteworthy that the English-language Japan Times, which was listed in the list of those subject to inspection and reported in the past, is not included in the purge this time. Some time ago, it was rumored that Foreign Minister Ashida would be purged because he served as the president and editor-in-chief of the newspaper, because the newspaper was subsidized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and often published speeches by warlords. Now it is not included in the purge, so it has aroused the surprise of the Japanese press. In fact, not only Ashida and the former Japan Times were favored under the rectification work. Let's look back at the past rectification, and we can understand it clearly.

Originally, in Japan, in addition to the important war criminals being tried by the Far East International Military Tribunal, the Allied Headquarters, in order to enable Japan to move towards democratization on a new path, first had to liquidate the corrupt elements in the backbone of society. Therefore, it issued an order on executing the purge of those who supported aggression, ordering the Japanese government to organize a Central Rectification Committee to handle the rectification of militarists and problematic people in Japanese politics, education, economy, and enterprises.

In Japanese enterprises, economy, and financial institutions, the top ten financial groups and those financial oligarchs lost their control. Companies with assets of more than one million yen were liquidated, and important officials and employees were purged and prohibited from serving in the purged and companies again.

In education, problematic faculty and staff were expelled from schools. Those professors who published martial ideas had to leave the lecture hall.

In politics, those who were purged included members of parliament and leaders of various local cities and towns before September 2, 1945, and those who held important positions in politics, economy, and propaganda were not allowed to hold official positions in the future.

At first glance, the above-mentioned rectification work seems to be very satisfactory, but it is not so in reality. Many of the members of the Central Rectification Committee themselves were suspected of being purged. During the Shidehara Cabinet, it had been using delaying methods, using financial and economic crises and food shortages and social crises, and investigating wartime activities to deal with the urging of the Allied Headquarters. It also instructed various political, military, financial, and financial institutions to change their appearance or break up into pieces. During that period of delay, secret police and some unknown martial artists had been installed as successors to those who were purged in the local area. Big financial companies were also mostly decentralized or reorganized. A group of pro-government professors still occupied the podium. Cabinet members were temporarily changed and listed for inspection to show leniency. Officials were promoted to important positions in the past. According to reports from American correspondents, former Prime Minister Yoshida not only did not actively prevent untrustworthy politicians from participating in politics, but also encouraged them to work behind the scenes.

Now, the rectification work in Japan is nearing completion, but the past rectification is really unsatisfactory. And in the final rectification that began in the political aspect, the Japan Times, which was once praised as a transmitter of aggression to the outside world, was allowed to go unpunished. At this time, we really request a comprehensive review of the rectification work, and ask the Committee for the Control of Japan and the Allied Headquarters to rectify and inspect the content of the rectification work, so that the purpose of rectification can be thoroughly achieved.

### Miscellany of a Trip to America

— Xu

Since warships are monsters on the sea, it seems that building ships in coastal shipyards is the right way. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, and said that American warships were built on the top of a mountain, I would definitely be scolded as ignorant. It's really wronged! American warships are indeed built on the top of a mountain. In peacetime, warships were originally built in shipyards on the east and west coasts, but since the outbreak of World War II, the coasts have been deeply threatened by the enemy. Not only are the shipyards likely to be bombed, but the workers are also unwilling to serve. Therefore, the shipbuilding equipment has been completely moved into the Rocky Mountains.

The Rocky Mountains are located in the central and western parts of the United States, mainly in the state of Colorado. They are one mile above sea level. Therefore, the capital of Colorado, "Denver", has another name, called City of One Mile High. If you ask a Rotary Club member from Colorado, they will definitely know and appreciate this nickname. When I lived in Denver, I was invited by the local "Friends of China Belly" to visit the shipyard in the mountains. The shipyard is located in the mountains, which can be regarded as an unprecedented wonder. We have never heard of China building a navy in Dongting Lake. It doesn't seem to be very worthy of the name, because those who make a living in the lake have never been called "military". But those who make a living in the Rocky Mountains are real navies. We set off from Denver by car, and the car drove for two hours before arriving at the shipyard. Although we couldn't see the entire ship, we were building various parts of the warship, and there were also parts as big as small bungalows. After they were built, they were transferred by car to the railway line, loaded on trains, and transported to the west coast, such as Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. It took a week or two to assemble tens of thousands of scattered parts into warships weighing tens of thousands of tons.

I am not the only Chinese person who visited the shipyard in the mountains. At that time, because the Pacific War was in full swing, there was no mention of it in the newspaper. The coastal areas of China are not without threats. If we really want to build a navy, we should build several shipyards in the mountains of Guizhou or Xikang, so as to avoid the threat of air surveillance to the coast. There will be no time to build ships. (13)

### A Distant Relative of Mankind

— Chang Shu

In terms of evolution, the entire animal kingdom is a big family. Taking humans as an individual, apes and monkeys are distant relatives of humans, with the same bloodline. So when you go to the zoo and see short monkeys jumping around, with yellow fur all over their bodies, and dragging a tail, you may think they are ugly and difficult to look at. You don't dare to think of them as the same kind, but this is not someone else, it is your distant relative. When you were in your mother's womb for the sixth month, not only did you look the same as them, but you also went through the same life as them for a short period of time.

There is a kind of large monkey in Africa that has beautiful golden hair and a large vermilion nose with bright green, grooved cheeks. It is the most peculiar and beautiful member of the baboon family, and it is also the most beautiful animal. This kind of large monkey loves to live in groups. If they get separated, they will not hesitate to travel long distances to find the whereabouts of their own kind.

In the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, there is a huge male monkey, or called Papi, which habitually knocks on the floor with a drinking cup to win the praise of its kind.

In the Washington National Zoo, there is a young large monkey whose intelligence is as beautiful as the color on its face. It will make all kinds of funny moves to please people. He lies on a poplar tree with his hands outstretched, passing a grass back and forth in his hands. The audience stands in front of him, waving a stick to attract attention. If you throw something at him, he will catch it one by one. It can break branches, hold an umbrella, and perform various poses in the cage, imitating people, often for an hour without getting tired.

In addition to these ways of playing, no matter how well-educated it is after being imprisoned, it still retains the ferocity it had in Africa. It has a hostile temperament towards enemies, strong teeth, and sharp claws. The aborigines of West Africa are very afraid of the group attacks of this kind of large monkey, and they also have some fear when it comes to these animals. Mask makers want to imitate the appearance of large monkeys to make horror masks, and that is the reason.

### An Exploration of the Pipa Record

— Xiao

Among the Yuan Dynasty operas that are popular today, the Pipa Record and the Romance of the West Chamber are the most prominent, and the lyrics and music of the Romance of the West Chamber are especially popular. This is because its content is mostly stories of talented scholars and beautiful women, which are easy to please young people. However, the Pipa Record is not the case. The whole book contains mostly trivial matters of loyal ministers, filial sons, virtuous women, and righteous husbands. Old people read it, or because it is related to the world, they can't bear to discard it. Young people read it, I'm afraid their ears will ring and their eyes will be dizzy, and they will fall asleep. However, in terms of its lyrics and music, it seems to be even better than the Romance of the West Chamber. It's just that the reader's intention is not here. According to what is recorded in He Yuanlang's "Discussion on Music" in the Ming Dynasty, when Gao Zecheng wrote this record, he had another meaning. At that time, there was a man named Wang Si who was friendly with Gao. Gao advised Wang to become an official. Wang passed the imperial examination, and then abandoned his wife and became attached to the family of the Taishi Bu Hua. Gao was deeply disgusted with it, so he wrote the Pipa Record to satirize Wang. The name Pipa was taken because the four kings on his head were a hidden reference to Wang Si. The Yuan people called cattle "Bu Hua", and the prime minister Niu in the book is Taishi Bu Hua. As for borrowing the great sage Cai Bojie as the protagonist in the book, it was caused by You's poem. You's "Bamboo Branch Temple" says: "The setting sun obliquely strikes the Zhao Family Village, the clapperboard teacher is performing, whether behind his back is right or wrong, the whole village is full of middle-aged gentlemen". Later, when the Ming Dynasty destroyed the Yuan Dynasty, they obtained the Pipa Record and loved it. Because he asked Zecheng the purpose of the book, he abandoned it with a dangerous attitude. The emperor was furious and executed Wang Si in the wilderness. The ancients' word for the cut was similar to an axe and an axe.

### In Memory of Mr. Merkenney

— Kui Sheng

The newspaper reported: "New York, 24th Broadcast, Mr. Meknei, Professor of Far Eastern History at the University of Chicago, died of a heart attack at the age of fifty-five." According to Mei, he was an expert in political science and history. His original name was H. McNair. He graduated from the University of California and was a disciple of the American political science authority Prof. Sait. Mei's Chinese translation should be Mi Henry (translated by others), and he taught at Yueda for more than ten years as the author's teacher. Mr. Mi and Professor Remer were both famous professors in the Department of Political Economy at Yueda and were very diligent in their studies. As for his academic approach, he studied politics in a historical and coherent way, and he was particularly knowledgeable about international and Far Eastern issues, which was the same as Mr. Liang Qichao from Xinhui. He was eloquent and his words were elegant. Thousands of years up and down were like threading beads. His vast knowledge is rare among domestic scholars. His research method focuses on Original Research, makes good use of Index Method, and transfers less textbook-like concrete writings. I remember when I was at the University of Yue, I wrote books late into the night, burning the midnight oil and forgetting to eat. Once the conversation started, he spoke fluently. He lived with his mother, and he was filial to her, and his actions were very oriental. Thinking of the teacher's door, it seems like yesterday, which makes people feel the sense of Liangmu.

### Religion and Morality

— Little Boy

W. Bello said: "Religion is the foundation of private morality and public trust, and it is also the foundation of personal happiness and national prosperity." G. Sperling also said: "There is no morality without religion." It seems that all countries in the world have religious elements. Most societies are evolving in a religious atmosphere, and human morality is changing in this environment. There are many religious sects from ancient times to the present. The most common are Christianity, Catholicism, Islam, and Buddhism, etc., and the doctrines are also different. Buddhism takes compassion as its main principle, Islam emphasizes self-cultivation, Catholicism regards piety as sacred, and Christianity practices universal love. However, there is only one true religion, just like personal belief, it cannot be multifaceted. The true religion is the religion that is in line with justice. Nothing can oppose it. Because human beings have different religious beliefs, and even some people have no religious beliefs, there is a lack of a common religious belief to promote private morality and no connection of public trust in the soul between people. Because of this, there is a deep separation between people with different beliefs, which inevitably leads to mutual jealousy, suspicion, infighting, damage, and other situations that harm morality. If this continues for a long time, how can personal morality not fall behind? How can a happy state of mind be cultivated in the heart of a person who lacks private morality? How can a country where people's beliefs are inconsistent and morality is low prosper?

Let's look at what Tolstoy said:

"Excellent people are the key to national prosperity, and religious belief is the only element that cultivates people to have good virtues."
