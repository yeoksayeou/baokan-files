The original Suiyuan Headquarters in Baoding and Zhangjiakou will be abolished. After paying respects to Chairman Chiang, the Tianjin Garrison Commander Ma Fahu returned to Tianjin on the 30th to report that the Chairman expressed great concern for North China and gave detailed instructions on military and political work. With this thorough adjustment of military command in North China, the overall situation is expected to improve daily.

It is reported that the new organization is currently being established. Its command area includes the four provinces of Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, as well as the section outside Shanhaiguan of the Beining Line. The Suiyuan Headquarters in Zhangjiakou and Baoding will be abolished, and the military command system for bandit suppression in North China will be unified. Many senior staff members of the Suiyuan Headquarters in Zhangjiakou have been summoned to Beiping to prepare plans. Director Fu is still staying in Beiping and has not returned.

"Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th" The Beiping Provisional Headquarters continued to hold military meetings this morning. Li Zongren, Xiong Shihui, Fu Zuoyi, Shangguan Yunxiang, Ma Fahu, Sun Lianzhong, Luo Zejun, Liu Guangji, and the five army commanders Hou Jingru, Zheng Zhenfeng, An Chunsheng, Yuan Pu, and Lin Weishu all attended. They discussed in detail the unification of military command in North China, the transfer and abolition of the existing Suiyuan Headquarters in Zhangjiakou and Baoding, and the plan and arrangements for establishing a new organization. Fu Zuoyi was in contact with all parties all day today, and was extremely busy. The general work has been decided, and he will return to Zhangjiakou tomorrow or the day after to give instructions on the closing of the Suiyuan Headquarters, and then return to Beiping to preside over the establishment of the new organization, while also serving as Deputy Director of the Beiping Provisional Headquarters.

Mr. Fu will return to Zhangjiakou tomorrow.

### The Battle for Yuanshi Reaches its Climax

"Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th" Official sources confirm: The National Army is still firmly defending Yuanshi City. Communications were once interrupted, but external contact was restored yesterday. Wei Yonghe, commander of the defending regiment, stated in a telegram that the bandit army's offensive has gradually eased in the past two days, and there has been no fierce fighting. The invading bandit forces are currently gathering in the suburbs, awaiting reinforcements to defend the city. They hope that the air force will provide a large amount of supplies by air and bomb the bandit positions.

"Another Dispatch" It is reported that the Communist bandits outside Baoding are frequently moving. The air force dispatched bombers yesterday to bomb the remaining bandits in the Wangdu and Mancheng areas. Two bandit warehouses were set on fire yesterday. There are also reports that the National Army in Baoding and Yuan planned a southward attack on Fangshun Bridge, but this is inaccurate. Several hundred bandits attacked Dada Ran south of Baoding and Yuan last night but failed and retreated. It is also learned that a large bandit detachment in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has recently been reduced in strength in Yu Du Jian Ke Hua, and there are attempts to attack Jinghai. The National Army is closely monitoring.

"Central News Agency, Baoding, 30th" The battle for Yuanshi is becoming more and more fierce. The bandits have suffered extremely heavy casualties due to repeated bombing and strafing by the air force, but the bandit forces at the four passes have continued to fiercely attack the city walls day and night. The defending army is desperately defending and fiercely counterattacking. The bandits have repeatedly approached the city, attempting to destroy the city walls with explosives, but were completely annihilated. The great battle for Yuanshi has reached its climax, and the morale of the defending army is extremely high.

"Central News Agency, Baoding, 30th" The peace between Beiping and Baoding is becoming increasingly consolidated. There are no large bandit forces near Dingxing and Zhuozhou counties. With the smooth progress of the military, passenger trains have reached Gucheng. The northbound army from Baoding has reached Caohe. There are still bandit activities between Xushui and Caohe, making repairs inconvenient. The National Army has dispatched troops to clear out the remaining bandits in the area, and the Beiping-Baoding line will soon be open to traffic.

### The National Army in Western Shandong Continues to Advance; Bandits in Northern Anhui Cross the Sha River and Flee Southwest

"Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 30th" On the 29th, the National Army's naval and air forces patrolled the bandit situation on both sides of the Sha River and discovered a pontoon bridge covered with straw and dozens of bandit boats southeast of Jiemu. There were also circular fortifications south of the bridge, and bombs were dropped to destroy them.

"Our Hankou Dispatch, 30th" Military News: The Liu bandit's 1st Column, which fled north from Huang'an and Macheng, has suffered heavy casualties due to the combined efforts of the National Army to encircle and suppress them. They are now encircled in the Luo Chen Dian and Ding Yuan Dian areas north of Jing Fu and Xuan Hua Dian. The National Army is launching a sweeping campaign. In addition, the main force of the bandit's 3rd Column briefly captured Macheng on the evening of the 28th, but were quickly surrounded and expelled by the National Army, and the remaining bandits fled towards Shangcheng.

"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" On the afternoon of the 29th, a certain unit of the National Army arrived in the area north of Lushi, and another unit arrived at Shangge, northeast of Lushi. The bandits in Lushi are now under pressure and are showing signs of fleeing east.

"Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 30th" The bandit forces in Yiyongjingfu and other counties are still rampant. The National Army is deploying forces to suppress them.

### Fierce Fighting Northeast of Jimo

"Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 30th" The remnants of Peng Dehuai's bandit army, defeated by the National Army near Yulin, have retreated to the Dachuan area north of Jiaocheng. Their 15th Regiment and the 6th Detachment of Jiaocheng are scattered bandits who are causing trouble in the mountains between Jiaocheng and Wenshui. Another unit of the bandit army, the newly formed 3rd Brigade, is causing trouble in the mountains west and northwest of Lingshi.

Mr. Li and his party will return to Nanjing in about a week.

### Foreign Exchange Policy: No Changes in the Near Future

"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" Regarding foreign exchange policy, there have been various rumors circulating recently. A reporter interviewed an economic authority today, who stated that there would be no changes in foreign exchange policy in the near future. He analyzed the reasons, stating that some have advocated implementing a fully open policy, allowing the market to determine prices. When implementing openness, market prices may rise sharply once, and in theory, they may gradually fall thereafter. However, the government is unwilling to take this great risk, fearing that once fully opened, it will be impossible to control. Although the current daily announcement of exchange rates is not a perfect policy, it is not the worst option either. The rise in prices is also gradual, so there will be no changes in foreign exchange policy in the near future.

### Our Representative to the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Issues Important Statement: Supports Establishment of Various Specialized Committees

"Central News Agency, Baguio, 29th" The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) discussed its methods and powers on the 29th. The Chinese representative, Li Gan, representing the Chinese government, issued an important statement on this issue, stating that the meeting could not address the issues hoped for by the people in this region because it was not a working group. However, the various economic needs of Asian and Far Eastern countries must be submitted by this commission to the Economic and Social Council, other United Nations agencies, and member states of the United Nations in order to obtain priority consideration and action. Mr. Li pointed out that the meeting should focus its efforts on a number of important issues so that it can complete its analysis and recommendations within a reasonable time. In his statement, Mr. Li supported the opinion of establishing various specialized committees within the ECAFE, and strongly suggested that the ECAFE should not wait for the completion of the commission's structure, but should immediately begin drafting some recommendations for economic construction. This recommendation is based on available materials. Li Gan supported the recommendations made by the ECAFE Secretariat, which advocated the establishment of a commodity committee to facilitate agreements between countries on the allocation and supply of scarce commodities. Mr. Li also suggested that a construction committee be established under the ECAFE, which should include government officials handling construction matters in the delegations of the next ECAFE meeting. Regarding the exchange of economic information, Mr. Li asked the committee to pay attention to two points: 1. The statistical standards of Western countries cannot be applied to most parts of the Far East, so the relevant implementation policies and measures will sometimes have to be determined based on approximate figures. 2. Although the ECAFE is not an organization that engages in practical work, it must strictly prevent it from becoming an academic or super-research organization. We must work so that the people of Asia and the Far East can have a better and richer life in the future.

### Indonesian Membership Issue to be Re-Discussed

"Central News Agency, Baguio, 29th" The issue of Indonesian participation will be raised again in the ECAFE next week. It is expected that the Chinese recommendation will be considered again, that is, the case of the Dutch and Indonesians separately requesting to obtain the qualifications of supporting member states should be postponed. The recommendation has already been passed by a vote of six to four (with no abstentions).

"Another Constant" The ECAFE will be adjourned on the 30th and will hold a full-day meeting on December 1st.

"Central News Agency, Baguio, 30th" Chiang Tingfu, the chief representative of my delegation to the ECAFE, visited President Roxas on the morning of the 30th to say goodbye. Mr. Chiang is scheduled to leave Baguio on the 2nd, pass through Manila, and return to China.

### Kuomintang Members Running for Election Should Comply with Nomination Principles: Central Party Headquarters Sends Telegram to Affiliated Organizations for Attention

"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" The Kuomintang Central Party has decided to send a telegram to all provincial and municipal party departments stating: "All comrades of our party must absolutely abide by the principle of party nomination, otherwise, even if elected, it will be invalid." When implementing this order, party departments in various provinces and cities will, in accordance with the party nomination method, notify the election offices to revoke the nomination of all party members who have not been nominated by the Central Committee, or who have been nominated as candidates, and who have been freely elected as formal members after the election. According to a central person in charge, the State Council passed the proposal of Zou Lu and others, members of the National Government, on the 28th, and the National Government will soon order the General Election Office to do so.

### Number of Seats for the Democratic and Youth Parties in Local Consultative Assemblies Awaiting Further Discussion

"Our Report" Although the participation of the Democratic and Youth Parties in the consultative assemblies of various provinces and cities has been agreed upon in principle, technical details still need to be discussed. Because the initial consultation resulted in the two parties being able to propose one-fifth of the seats, but if this percentage is proposed based on the current number of consultative assemblies in various places, then after participation, it will be one-sixth of the total number, not one-fifth. This point was not noticed during the initial consultations, but because this matter will affect the number of future supervisors, the two parties have requested further consultations.

"Our Jinan Dispatch, 30th" The Jinan Journalists Association has repeatedly telegraphed the government, arguing that it is unfair to include Shandong, a pacification area, in the eastern region for the election of national delegates for journalists, along with provinces and cities that have been completely restored. They requested that it be reassigned to the northern region and that the voting rights of journalists' associations in counties and cities that have not been restored be retained. The provincial and municipal councils also advocated the same, but to no avail. They hereby declare their abandonment of voting rights.

"Our Chengdu Dispatch, 30th" Local officials here have no knowledge of the rumors from Shanghai that many members of the Youth Party were assassinated in Sichuan while running for election.

### Sino-British Air Transport Agreement to be Implemented Tomorrow: Flights on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Shanghai Route

"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" After the signing of the Sino-British Air Transport Agreement, it has now begun to be implemented. British Hong Kong Airlines has decided to launch flights on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Shanghai route starting on December 2. There will be round trips between Hong Kong and Shanghai every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and round trips between Guangzhou and Shanghai every Wednesday and Friday. There will be three daily round trips between Guangzhou and Hong Kong. However, in order to protect China's fledgling aviation industry, the number of passengers between Shanghai and Hong Kong will not exceed 50 per week. The application for flight procedures for long-distance routes is currently in progress. The British will be responsible for Overseas Airlines, and China will be responsible for China Airlines. It will begin soon.

### International Postage Increases: Up by One-Third Starting Today

The airfare for sending parcels to the United States by air is 610,000 yuan per kilogram.

### Authorities Decide to Use Political Power to Quickly Suppress Prices; A Responsible Person Talks About Two Factors of Soaring Prices

"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" In order to cope with the current soaring prices, the authorities have decided to deal with the matter politically in order to quickly suppress and stabilize them. A responsible person emphasized this point when speaking to reporters on the 30th. He said: The price problem can be divided into two aspects. One is the economic factor, which is an inevitable phenomenon at present. The other is the human factor. In the soaring prices of the previous month, the human factor accounted for a greater proportion, so the government has decided to deal with the matter politically.

### Overseas Chinese in Siam Peaceful After Coup; Li Lirou and Others Arrive in Beijing to Express

"Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th" Li Lirou, Secretary-General of the Kuomintang General Branch in Siam; Huang Minhun, Standing Committee Member and Director of the Bangkok Gazette; and Sun Jiaqi, Finance and Cultural Movement Committee Member, jointly told reporters on the 30th that the situation of overseas Chinese was peaceful after the coup in Siam, and overseas Chinese stores were operating as usual. Mr. Li and others returned to China from Bangkok on the 21st.

### Negotiations on the Japanese Peace Treaty at a Standstill; Secretary Marshall Plans to Hold Private Talks to Find a Breakthrough; Soviet Suggestions Aim to Delay

"United Press, Washington, 29th" The Soviet Union's demand that the four powers formulate the Japanese peace treaty has blocked the United States' four-month effort to resolve the Japanese peace treaty today. Whether to continue negotiations with other allied countries in the Pacific depends on whether the Soviet Union needs to participate, and no decision has been made at this time. Diplomats expect that Secretary of State Marshall may break the deadlock by holding private talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Bevin during the current four-foreign ministers meeting. The negotiating situation will remain at a standstill until Secretary Marshall submits his report or the four foreign ministers in London conclude their meeting.

"United Press, Grinnell, Iowa, 30th" Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun said yesterday at the Grinnell College Institute of International Affairs that the Soviet Union has obstructed the opportunity for an early conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty, and that the establishment of an independent organization in Korea has been hampered to date. Mr. Gu hinted that the Soviet Union is assisting the Chinese Communists in the civil war, and said that China needs assistance, and the sooner the assistance, the better for world peace. The Far East issue is as important as the European issue. The Communists in North China and Northeast China are not completely detached from foreign ideas and assistance.

"Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th" British and American people here believe that the Soviet Union's note to China suggesting that a special meeting of the four foreign ministers be held in China in January next year to initially discuss the Japanese peace treaty indicates that the Soviet Union is still determined to delay the signing of the peace treaty as much as possible.

"Reuters, London, 29th" The Far East peace treaty was mentioned twice in today's foreign ministers' meeting, which made people increasingly believe that Molotov will make the German and Japanese peace treaties difficult. When Molotov opposed the idea of establishing a German regional government today, he said: The whole of Germany, the whole of Europe, and the whole world, including Japan, urgently need peace. This statement indicates that the Soviet Union will demand the acceleration of discussions on the Japanese peace treaty. And if the German government is allowed to participate in the creation of the peace treaty before the allied countries agree on the German peace treaty, it will be an important precedent, allowing Japan to demand similar rights when formulating the Far East peace treaty.

### Twelve Former US Ambassadors to Foreign Countries Jointly Urge Military Aid to China: Telegram Sent to the Foreign Affairs Committees of Both Houses and Secretary Marshall

"United Press, New York, 29th" Twelve former US ambassadors to foreign countries sent a joint telegram to the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and Secretary of State Marshall on the 29th, urging military equipment and financial and economic aid to China. The telegram stated: We believe that if China falls under the control of the Soviet Union, the important interests of the United States will be seriously threatened, so we strongly urge you to provide the Chinese government with the necessary military equipment and financial and economic assistance. The signatories of this telegram are former Ambassador to Poland Bullitt, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlen, former Ambassador to Chile Collier, former Ambassador to Mexico Daniels, former Ambassador to Paraguay Frost, former Ambassador to Germany Shotwell, former Ambassador to Panama Hibbard, former Ambassador to Norway Osborne, former Ambassador to Italy Phillips, former Ambassador to Turkey Skinner, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt, and former Ambassador to Spain Weddell.

"Central News Agency, San Francisco, 30th" The non-partisan Seattle Times today strongly urged the congressional representatives of Washington State to support New York Governor Dewey's request for immediate aid to China, and urged the House Foreign Affairs Committee to build a trace of US$60 million in interim aid to China. The newspaper's editorial was titled "China Should Not Be Forgotten" and expressed regret that President Truman did not mention China in his message to Congress. It praised Dewey's request to include China in the US foreign aid plan, and said: "If Truman and his advisors have neglected the urgent needs of China and its importance to the Western Hemisphere and Western culture, then the people of the American Pacific Northwest have not neglected the significance of preserving China as a potential democratic nation, which has a profound meaning for our own economic and political future. Therefore, the general public wants to include China in the relief plan, and the emotion is extremely strong. The congressional representatives of this state should take the lead in supporting the amendment to the foreign aid plan proposed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee for China."

"Central News Agency, New York, 29th" There is a growing number of people discussing aid to China in the United States. Most discussions focus on the Republican Party's insistence on giving equal weight to aid to China and aid to Western Europe. In terms of domestic politics, just in New York alone, there are five well-known commentators writing articles commenting on the China issue, including columnists Krock of the New York Times, Sullivan and Sokolsky of the Forward Forum, Elliott of the Post, and Grafton. The main points of their comments are as follows: (Continued on page two)

### A View of Shandong Province from Jiaodong: A Comprehensive Report from Our Jinan Correspondent, Li Tian

"Aeronautical News from Our Jinan Office, 28th of the Month": Even now, the "Three Mountains" (namely, Dazeshan Mountain northeast of Pingdu, Juchiya Mountain southeast of Xixia, and Kunyu Mountain southeast of Muping) remain the largest strongholds of the Lu Communists in Jiaodong. The former was once entirely recovered by the National Army, and part of Juchiya Mountain was also recovered by the National Army. However, since the local guerrilla forces of the Communists far outnumbered the local teams of the National Army, the Communist guerrillas, mainly engaged in guerrilla warfare, coordinated with the Communist regular army's Second, Seventh, Ninth, and Thirteenth Corps, as well as part of the Fourth Corps, mainly engaged in mobile warfare. Taking advantage of the gap when part of the National Army was successively transferred south after settling the Jiaodong region, they launched offensives one after another, infiltrating Yexian, Pingdu, Jiaoxian, Shouguang, and the Fanjiaji area southeast of Changyi. They then launched a siege to probe Gaomi. However, under the National Army's mobile deployment and flexible operations, although the Communists gained some small advantages in certain minor battles, strategically, the occupation of key ports such as Longkou, Yantai, and Weihaiwei, and the recovery of most towns in eastern Liaoning, cut off the Lu Communists' international connection and reduced their source of manpower and food. This made the Communists deeply feel the "difficulty in obtaining food" and the "lack of shoes, clothing, and blankets." In the end, even Su Yu, Chen Yi's deputy, had to issue the lament "Counter-offensive, counter-offensive, Shandong is lost!" The widespread decline in their morale and the broadly deepened sense of failure are not difficult to imagine.

However, the capture of several important points and lines must not be regarded as "the final blow at the end of the Shandong campaign." The Lu Communist guerrillas still have as many as ninety-six regiments today. In the past, the central government established sixteen security regiments for Shandong, but in reality, over the past year, the central government has ordered Shandong to allocate as many as twenty-eight regiments of the National Army's regular troops. This resulted in the landlord forces, which Chairman Wang Yaowu had painstakingly rebuilt, becoming the National Army, far deviating from the inherent principles of "guns not leaving the person, the person not leaving the village, and not abandoning production." Therefore, as far as Shandong is concerned, some non-strategic towns had to be temporarily and painfully abandoned voluntarily.

To ensure that the people can smoothly return to their hometowns and reorganize, it is necessary to match force with force. Although the National Army's regular troops are more than capable of dealing with the Communist field armies and their corps, if the government's local teams are not cultivated to a level capable of dealing with the Communist guerrillas, it would be like a cripple with only one leg, unable to operate freely and effectively in combat. Currently, there are about thirty regiments of Shandong local forces undergoing continued training.

When the Communists withdrew from southern Shandong and the Yimeng Mountain area in central Shandong, they destroyed everything in the same way. In the Yimeng Mountain area, it is often the case that one cannot see any sign of human habitation or a complete house for hundreds of miles. The weeds grow taller than the trees, even more desolate than the areas around Ruijin and Ningdu in Jiangxi in previous years. But all of this is not a big deal. If you travel to the areas of Dancheng, Juye, Jinxiang, Chengwu, Yutai, Shanxian, and Caoxian in southwestern Shandong, it would be like visiting an ancient battlefield. The county seats here have been lost at least four times, usually six or seven times, and the most is Dancheng, which has been lost a total of nine times. Of the county magistrates appointed by the Shandong provincial government, three were killed in battle, two were captured, and the most recent one also requested to resign due to being overwhelmed by the hardship. Therefore, serving as a county magistrate in Shandong is generally regarded as a "candidate for martyrdom." Now, in the recovered areas of western Shandong, it is extremely difficult to even find a table or a stool, because these had long been used as firewood by the Red bandits during numerous "seesaw battles." The garrison and the common people alike sit on the ground and sleep on the ground, building grass sheds next to broken bricks, dilapidated walls, and ruined rubble to shelter from the wind and rain. Some restored elementary schools can only conduct classes in the open air, teaching by drawing on the ground.

Since southwestern Shandong is the only transportation hub for Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng to reach northern Shandong and southern Hebei after the National Army settled central Shandong and Jiaodong, this area has also become their most important supply base. For the bandits, it is imperative to defend it, and for the National Army, in order to coordinate with future encirclement and suppression plans against the Communist bandits in the Central Plains, this area has become "attacking what they must defend"!

After the Yellow River freezes, it may provide some convenience to the Communists in terms of material supply and troop movement. Therefore, some people have begun to worry whether the Communists will launch a siege against Jinan, following the example of Shijiazhuang. After the reporter inquired with relevant parties, it was unanimously believed that the possibility was very small.

However, as Commander Wang Yaowu told this newspaper's reporter, "We have already begun to make the most active preparations for manpower, equipment, and food. The city defense fortifications have also been strengthened. We should do as Sun Tzu said, 'Do not rely on the enemy not coming, but rely on our preparedness to meet them.'"

Editorial

### Further Discussion on the Preliminary Conference for the Peace Treaty with Japan After the Soviet Union's Reply to Our Country's Proposal

In order to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union on the procedures for the peace treaty with Japan, our government sent notes to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union on November 17, proposing that a preliminary conference for the peace treaty with Japan be organized by the member states of the Far Eastern Commission, with the four major powers retaining the right of veto. This newspaper's editorial on November 21 pointed out that the submission of this proposal during the London Foreign Ministers' Conference indicated that although the issue of the peace treaty procedures with Japan had fallen into a deadlock, there was still a path to be taken. China's proposal was highly compromising, and was a reasonable and constructive plan in terms of reconciling the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union and respecting the status of the other eight countries. The opinions of many countries were the same as our observations, with the same hopes, and expectations for a practical reply from the United States and the Soviet Union. Now, the Soviet Union's reply was submitted on November 28, which seemed to be possibly close to our country's proposal, but greatly different from the United States' opinion. Various different reactions have been issued by public opinion in the United Kingdom and the United States. The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have not yet made any formal statements on the Chinese and Soviet notes. How will this deadlock be broken? It is generally felt that it is difficult to predict.

The Soviet government's reply to our government's note is also a kind of proposal in nature, but it firmly insists that the peace treaty with Japan be discussed by the foreign ministers of the four major powers, rejecting consultations with the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission, and has not changed its previous stance. The only point on which the Soviet Union's reply is relatively close to our country's is the maintenance of the four major powers' right of veto. What the Soviet Union's reply has not agreed upon with our country's proposal is the issue of joint consultations by the Far Eastern Commission. What the Soviet Union proposed should be welcomed by our country is that the preliminary conference for the peace treaty should be held in China, with the time being January of next year. Therefore, we say that the opinions of China and the Soviet Union have become closer than before, but not completely close. In the eyes of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet Union's proposal is not a new opinion, it is still a revision of the opinions of China, the United Kingdom, and the United States, so news from Washington indicates a cold reception. Summarizing the attitudes and stances of the four countries, three different plans have now been produced regarding the convening of a preliminary conference for the peace treaty with Japan. The deadlock seems to have entered a more complex stage, without any signs of being eliminated or simplified. The attitudes and stances of the United Kingdom and the United States have formed one plan, and China and the Soviet Union each hold a plan. The location and time of the conference seem to be of little relevance. The points of contention among the three different plans still lie in the issue of convening and drafting by four countries or eleven countries, and whether the four countries' right of veto should be maintained. This is a dispute over the procedures of the peace conference, and also a dispute over the rights of the major powers. We are concerned about this issue, and would like to restate our opinions as follows:

First, the issue of convening and drafting by four countries or eleven countries. We agree with the government's proposition that the preliminary conference for the peace treaty should be organized by the Far Eastern Commission. The war against Japan was a war in the Far East and the Pacific. The contributions of the eleven countries of the Far East to defeating Japan, although different due to the order in which they joined the war and the severity of the losses in the campaigns, are consistent in their contribution to preventing aggression. Furthermore, they have a precedent for signing the Japanese surrender terms, so they should not be excluded from discussing the peace treaty. In terms of legal principles, the Far Eastern Commission was created by the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference in December 1945, and was endorsed by the Chinese government. Since February 26, 1946, the Far Eastern Commission has been working to control Japan and rebuild peace in the Far East, and should naturally be responsible for the preliminary matters of the peace treaty with Japan. Admittedly, the organization of the Far Eastern Commission was proposed by former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, as a coordination of the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union at the time. Molotov reluctantly accepted it, and it was naturally not the organization that the Soviet Union ideally wanted to control Japan. However, today, as the organization of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is becoming increasingly limited to a few members and its nature is becoming increasingly autocratic, with the rights and status of China and France both facing severe restrictions, in order to strengthen international cooperation and rebuild peace in the Far East, it is indeed a strategy that respects the rights and status of the majority of countries to have the eleven countries jointly responsible for the preliminary matters of the peace treaty with Japan.

Second, the issue of the right of veto of the four major powers. The right of veto is the right of agreement of the major powers. It is not only present at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, but also at the meetings of the Far Eastern Commission, where the four countries of the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union also have it. Our government respects the form of the Far Eastern Commission and opposes the United Kingdom and the United States only adopting a two-thirds majority decision, precisely in order to maintain the tradition of the four major powers retaining the right of veto. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France all retain the right of veto for the peace treaty with Germany; therefore, China should also retain the right of veto for the peace treaty with Japan. The right of veto is our guarantee, and our country must safeguard it. The peace treaty with Japan is more important to our country's future survival than to any other country. In order to uphold the United Nations Charter and safeguard the country's interests, we do not avoid being suspected of siding with the Soviet Union, and firmly advocate the four powers' right of agreement, i.e., the right of veto of one country. Our country's proposal that the peace treaty with Japan be prepared jointly by eleven countries, with the condition of retaining the four powers' right of agreement, is in accordance with legal principles and adapts to the situation. We hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will be mutually tolerant and accommodating, taking the strengths of each other's different plans and seeking a compromise, so that all deadlocks can be easily resolved.

The path to breaking the deadlock is not very difficult. As long as the Soviet Union agrees to convening by eleven countries and does not adhere to the proposition of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, and the United Kingdom and the United States agree to the four powers' right of agreement and abandon the preconceived notion of a simple two-thirds majority decision, the deadlock will be broken. Resolving international disputes depends on compromise between countries. Roosevelt's ideal of the United Nations is to have sincerity and fairness as the highest realm. We read Byrnes' "Speaking Frankly" and deeply feel that the politicians and diplomats of powerful countries seem to lack the compromising nature needed to resolve international disputes. We are deeply concerned about the future of international cooperation. We would like to reiterate our position here: China's proposal contains compromise and is constructive. We hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will reconsider it calmly and seek a path to breaking the deadlock!

### Calls for U.S. Aid to China

(Continued from page one) Mr. Krock, the most experienced and conservative journalist in American domestic news, believes that the call for aid to China by New York Governor Dewey and other congressional Republican leaders is a mixture of Republican political planning and genuine concern about the threat of the spread of communist forces in Asia. The Republican stance on the China issue has formed a debate on foreign policy, and in this regard, the Republican Party is able to lead the Democratic Party for the first time in several years, moving toward a common goal, rather than simply following behind. The Republican Party finds it difficult to follow the Democratic government on the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, but the Republican Party's concern for China and its proposal for aid, while the government focuses on Western Europe, are points of departure on this issue. However, U.S. policy toward China will not develop into a direct dispute between the two major parties. The government may not consider China's future to be as important to the United States as Europe's. The government's view is that the first thing to do should be done first, not that the second thing is secondary, but that the second thing can wait until the foundation for completing the first thing has been laid.

Sullivan, a Republican and close friend of Hoover, and a so-called old Republican, attaches great importance to Dewey's speech on aid to China. He believes that Dewey's speech on the 24th and the $60 million emergency aid to China proposal put forward by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 25th are in agreement. However, the latter is an action by congressional Republicans to express unanimous support for the proposal put forward by the Governor of New York, who is also the nominal leader of the Republican Party. In any case, this is a non-trivial development. Resistance to communism on a worldwide basis has become the policy of the Republican Party, and this policy is more complete and sufficient than the policy held by the government. The Republican Party's new policy is by no means contrary to the government's policy.

Sokolsky, who had close relations with the Chinese Communist Party from 1919 to 1931, and who is now an outspoken critic of international communism, called on the United States to transfer the surplus war materials stored in the Atlantic region to Chairman Chiang. He said: Chairman Chiang is actually fighting to resist foreign aggression.

Grafton, who is recognized as a liberal and a loyal supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal, believes that Dewey's advocacy of aid to China is for his own political gain. He said: The U.S. government has not forgotten China.

Elliott, nominally a military analyst and commentator, but who also often touches on diplomatic issues, reiterated his argument that the United States must focus its limited resources on the reconstruction of Western Europe, and should not attempt to aid both Europe and China at the same time, thereby exhausting its energy.

Although the above opinions do not represent everything, they can reflect the main differences of opinion among people of all walks of life in the United States regarding the relative importance of Europe and China in the U.S. plan. Secondly, due to the comments from the Republican side inside and outside Congress, a higher degree of interest in the China issue has been aroused among Americans, because the Republican side has criticized the government's China policy, criticizing its lack of a China policy. Third, with the U.S. presidential election just around the corner, one party or both parties may try to take advantage of domestic and foreign issues as much as possible for its own political effect, and seek advantages by attacking what it considers to be loopholes in the other party's policies or government affairs.

### UN General Assembly Concludes; Partition Plan for Holy Land Finally Passed; Arab Representatives Group Exits the Venue

[United Press, New York, 30th] The United Nations 1947 General Assembly has concluded. Although the situation showed a slight improvement due to cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Palestine partition case, the two major powers clashed almost everywhere on other important issues. The US-Soviet dispute will continue to emerge in the London Foreign Ministers Conference. Assembly President Aranha announced the closing of the session after presiding over the opening ceremony for seventy-four days, six hours, and fifty-eight minutes, and stated that this session must advance the world "into peace, or it will be a dispute". Aranha had stated yesterday that the world is watching the London Conference, and he requested the participating countries to seek the right path to peace. Lie stated: "Human evolution is not divided by era or territory, but war can be prohibited, especially since humanity's ultimate goal is peace, and agreement on peace treaties with Germany, Austria, and Japan will be a concrete step in coordination on other issues."

[Reuters, Flushing, 29th] The UN General Assembly recently passed the Palestine partition plan by a vote of 33 to 13. China, the United Kingdom, and ten other countries abstained, and Siam was absent. The Holy Land will be divided into two independent Arab and Jewish states and an internationally administered city of Jerusalem. The United Nations will select a committee to go to the Holy Land to implement the partition plan, which is scheduled to be completed on August 1, 1948. The affirmative votes of France, Haiti, Liberia, and the Philippines were the reason for the majority exceeding two-thirds. Before the vote, Lebanese representative Chamoun proposed a six-point federal plan as a compromise solution in order to prevent the passage of the partition plan, advocating the establishment of a Palestinian federation with governments in both Jewish and Arab states. Representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union both believed that the proposal was not a compromise and demanded an immediate vote on the partition plan.

The General Assembly then appointed Bolivia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Panama, and the Philippines as members of the United Nations Committee to assume responsibility for the implementation of the partition plan. When the voting result was announced, applause thundered in the audience. More than a dozen Jews could not contain themselves and wept, while Arab representatives stood up to protest. Syrian representative Khoury immediately announced that Arabs and Muslims around the world would obstruct the implementation of the partition, and said that all of Asia and its 1 billion people would oppose partition, while the Jewish state would be located at the gateway to Asia. Husseini, Vice Chairman of the Arab Higher Committee, also declared, "This is a resolution on paper, it must be implemented in Palestine, I hope you will live to see the outbreak of bloodshed!" Representatives from Iraq and Syria stated that they had hoped for justice, but today this belief has been destroyed. The Charter has been murdered, and everyone knows who the criminals are, and our government will not recognize this resolution, nor will it be responsible for the consequences caused by this resolution. After the Arab representatives protested, they exited the venue as a group.

### Signs of Riots in the Holy Land; Arabs Grieved, Jews Celebrated Wildly

[United Press, Jerusalem, 30th] Today, five Jews have been killed. Jews immediately declared that Arabs had first used violence after the United Nations decided to partition Palestine. British troops immediately isolated traffic between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Jews celebrated wildly all night, while the Arab areas were silent. However, Arabs held demonstrations in the town of Nablus, halfway between Jerusalem and Haifa, with large numbers of Arabs listening to speeches advocating resistance to the partition. Demonstrators telegraphed Archbishop Husseini, stating, "We are prepared to shed blood" to prevent Palestine from being split into Jewish and Arab states. Husseini is currently in Damascus and is said to be planning to attend the Palestinian Higher Arab Committee. The enthusiasm of the Jewish celebration was only seen since 1917 when British General Allenby liberated the Holy Land. Jews shouted "Long live the Jewish state", and even mocked the British royal family, but no accidents occurred.

### UN Committee Headquarters to be Established in Tel Aviv; Arabs Express Refusal to Cooperate

[Reuters, Flushing, 30th] After the UN General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan, the question now facing the United Nations is how to implement it. The next step should be to appoint representatives from Bolivia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Panama, and the Philippines as members of the United Nations Committee to carry out the implementation of the partition plan. Once the members are determined, they will be assigned secretaries and other staff and depart for Palestine. It is said that the headquarters of the committee will be located in the city of Tel Aviv, in order to liaise with the Jewish defense forces on the takeover of the British troops, and to contact Jewish councils, the Jewish National Committee and other groups to lay the foundation for the establishment of a Jewish provisional government committee. Since the Arab representatives have clearly refused to cooperate with the United Nations Committee, responsible observers predict that the Arabs of Palestine will establish their own provisional government and do their best to occupy the land of Palestine.

### Egypt on High Alert to Prevent Anti-Jewish Riots

[Reuters, Cairo, 30th] After the news of the UN General Assembly's passage of the Palestine partition plan arrived, the Egyptian government immediately declared all national police forces on emergency status to prevent possible anti-Jewish riots.

[United Press, Cairo, 30th] An official spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry recently declared that the United Nations' partition of Palestine is "a signal of war, not only in Arab countries, but also in other countries around the world." He stated that Arab countries do not recognize the United Nations' binding force.

### UNESCO Condemns War Profiteers; UNESCO Passes French Amendment

### Dalton Delivers Speech; Britain Passes Economic Crisis

[Reuters, Newcastle, 30th] Dalton gave his first public speech since resigning as Chancellor of the Exchequer here yesterday to two thousand unemployed workers and their families, declaring that the worst period of Britain's economic crisis has passed. He said that we are at a watershed in the post-war world, we have already climbed the ridge, and the path down the mountain will be easier from now on. It is expected that from 1948 onwards, Britain's industrial output will gradually increase, allowing imports to increase and people to obtain adequate standards of clothing and food.

### Pakistan Participates in Peace Conference on Germany; Four Foreign Ministers Reach Agreement; Soviets Insist on Establishing Central German Government

[Reuters, London, 29th] The four foreign ministers have met four times to discuss agenda issues, and only two points have been agreed upon today: They agreed to recognize Pakistan as an allied nation and allow it to submit opinions on the preparation of the peace treaty with Germany. It was agreed that after the foundation of the peace treaty with Germany is established, the countries that will attend the peace conference will be discussed. Other discussions are still focused on whether to discuss the central German government first, or to discuss the preparation of the peace treaty first.

The positions of the four foreign ministers are described as follows: Bevin's proposed plan advocates for a proper German government first, to submit opinions on the peace treaty and sign the peace treaty. Bidault advocates discussing the peace treaty first, believing that setting up a government first poses a danger to the content of the peace treaty. Marshall believes that drafting the peace treaty is the most urgent matter, but he also said that the peace treaty and the government cannot be mutually dependent. Molotov still insists that there must be a German government first before discussing the peace treaty.

The four foreign ministers first discussed Document No. 78 on the peace treaty procedure from the previous Moscow Conference today. The first point of contention was whether Albania and Pakistan should be allowed to submit opinions on the peace treaty. Molotov advocated allowing the two countries to submit opinions, while Marshall said that he could not recognize that Albania had a state of war with Germany, so he could not accept Albania. Molotov replied that Albania had fought against the Axis powers. Bevin also opposed Albania, pointing out that Britain had not yet established good relations with Albania, so he proposed that the Albanian issue be discussed at a later date and that Pakistan be allowed to participate first. Molotov nodded in agreement, and the case was resolved. The four foreign ministers then entered into a discussion of which should come first, the peace conference or the German government. Foreign Secretary Bevin made the following suggestions in order to speed up the discussion: A representative of the German government should express opinions at the peace conference, the peace treaty should be signed by a German government, and the peace treaty must be approved by Germany. Bevin also advocated that the issues of expressing opinions, signing, and approval should be left for discussion at the end of the discussion, so as not to hinder the current agreement. Marshall said that Bevin's suggestion still needed to be studied, and he said that the most urgent task at present is to draft the peace treaty, adding that the U.S. representative hopes that a proper German government will exist before the peace conference is convened, but the peace conference and the German government issue must not be mutually dependent. In short, when the German peace conference is held, a representative of the German government or a responsible representative assembly should be allowed to express their opinions. Bidault believes that the issue of the German central government should be discussed when discussing Germany's future political status, and that before the peace conditions are established in Germany and it can be guaranteed that Germany will respect democratic principles, the current Allied Control Council should not be disbanded.

### French Government Halts Strike Wave; Decides to Take Stern Measures; Parliament Discusses Empowerment Bill All Night

[Our Report] London, 30th Broadcast: Paris, the French National Assembly held a session all night yesterday, and as of noon today, the meeting was still in progress. The main topic of discussion was how to eliminate the strike wave and protect workers who do not participate in the strike. Communist Party members spoke out and fiercely criticized the Schumann cabinet, causing the meeting to be interrupted.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Prime Minister Schumann submitted a bill to ban strikes at a special meeting of the National Assembly this morning. Schumann loudly declared that if the strikes continued until December 1, they would dig a grave for the French currency. The bill grants the government special powers to deal with the labor situation, including increasing sanctions against saboteurs, ensuring freedom to work, strengthening the protection of the Republic's system, and increasing national police force, etc. The struggle between the Communist Party and the Schumann government has clearly reached a final juncture.

The atmosphere in Paris is tense, with fears that the Communist Party will occupy public buildings and cut off Paris's connection with the outside world through strikes. At the same time, according to reliable sources, over the past 24 hours, 180 people have been arrested on charges of sabotage and obstructing work. In Saint-Etienne, central France, protesters attempted to invade the city hall and police station. The police responded with tanks and tear gas.

[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] The Parliament held a full-night session to discuss Prime Minister Schumann's request for special powers to deal with labor unrest and protect non-striking personnel. Communist Party members adopted obstructionist tactics, making it impossible for the bill to be voted on. The meeting has lasted for twenty hours so far, until 10 a.m. this morning, and has not yet adjourned. Interior Minister Moch declared that if the Communist Party continues to disrupt, the government will order it to do so. 1,500 railway workers in the Paris suburbs also held a full-night meeting and voted to take action "at an appropriate time." If a strike is implemented, it would be a major blow to the government. The number of striking workers has now reached two million.

### Negotiations Between the Government and the General Confederation of Labor Have Broken Down

[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] The French government, led by Prime Minister Schumann, took stern measures yesterday, while there was also much criticism in the National Assembly, which was clearly beyond the expectations of the Communist leaders in the General Confederation of Labor. Their negotiations with Labor Minister Mayer on conditions for calling off the strike continued until dawn on Sunday, ending at 4:55 a.m., without reaching a compromise. General Confederation of Labor leader Frachon said: "We are not satisfied, we have done our best, but all our demands have been rejected. We intend to turn the results to our comrades."

### Thorez Returns to Paris

### International Socialist Conference; Laski Warns the U.S. and Soviet Union

### Countries Receiving U.S. Aid Should Reduce Currency Value

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, Associated Press] Representative Wolcott, Chairman of the House Banking Committee, today suggested that countries receiving U.S. aid must reduce the value of their currency against the U.S. dollar in accordance with the "actual basis". The committee may be ordered to handle any legislation relating to official companies organizing and handling foreign aid plans. He believes that the United States has not paid attention to the impact of foreign currencies on the U.S. domestic economy. He said that most of the ills of the domestic economy are caused by the inflation of foreign currency values. The inflation of foreign currency values promotes the export of various countries to the United States and forces Americans to make up for the difference between the "true value" and the statutory value of the currency.

### Pridi Broadcasts to the People; Free Thai Army to Take Action

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 29th] Former Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong, broadcast to the Siamese people from the Singapore radio station on the night of the 27th, urging the Siamese people to maintain stability and avoid violence. He also defended the political status of the Free Siamese State, saying: "I hope that our goal of restoring the sacred constitution of the Siamese people's freedom of choice will be achieved by peaceful means within a reasonable period of time."

This coup group explains that Pridi's broadcast is a propaganda campaign aimed at preventing the world from attaching importance to the new Siamese government. Most observers believe that Pridi's broadcast is an order to the Free Siamese members across the country. Since Pridi left the country, it has been rumored throughout Siam that the Free Siamese State is ready to attack the military control forces withdrawing from Siam, especially in the northeast of Siam. According to today's report, the military authorities have learned that the Free Siamese Army will launch a large-scale operation tomorrow.

### Foreign Ministers' Representatives Conference Discusses Austrian Peace Treaty; Report May Not Be Completed as Scheduled

[Reuters, London, 29th] The four foreign ministers' representatives discussing the Austrian issue held their third meeting at 10:30 this morning and are still in the explanatory stage. Only two days remain before Tuesday, the deadline for submitting their report to the Foreign Ministers Conference. The British, American, and Soviet representatives have not yet indicated whether they can accept France's compromise proposal on German assets in Austria. So far, only French representative Seydoux has clarified how much property of the Austrian oil industry will actually be transferred to the Soviet Union under the French compromise plan, and how much compensation Austria should pay to the Soviet Union for the property that cannot actually be transferred. Soviet representative Kozyrev has raised some supplementary factual questions, but has not stated whether he accepts the French proposal. Observers still express doubts about whether the representatives will be able to submit a unanimous report on Tuesday.

### Implementation of Emergency Measures to Suppress Rebellion: Strict Control of Finance and Materials, Chiang Ching-kuo Likely to Head New Agency; Fundamental Solutions Submitted to Chairman for Approval

Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tie-wu, Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, and Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao recently received orders from the Chairman, instructing them to formulate effective measures and thoroughly implement them to stabilize the financial situation, curb prices, and improve people's livelihoods. Following the order, Xuan and others invited several economic experts for detailed research and have drafted both temporary and fundamental solutions. According to Central News Agency reporters, the temporary solution, named "Emergency Measures to Suppress Economic Rebellion," has been granted full authority by the Chairman and was implemented on November 28th, with intensified implementation starting December 1st.

The Songhu Garrison Command, the Municipal Government, and the Central Bank, the three agencies jointly implementing the "Emergency Measures to Suppress Economic Rebellion," are adopting a division of labor and cooperation approach. A general executive agency will be established in the coming days, and its head will be a senior official appointed by the central government, with Chiang Ching-kuo as a likely candidate. It is reported that Chiang has been ordered to come to Shanghai within a day or two.

The first step of the "Emergency Measures" is to tighten the money supply. National banks will stop lending and overdrafts, and the same restrictions will be extended to current accounts at other banks, minimizing the liquidity of the legal tender. Remittances to Shanghai from other areas will be rejected, especially from the north and Hong Kong. It is expected that the tight money situation in the city will be unprecedented, and prices will continue to fall. Speculators who stir up trouble will inevitably suffer the consequences, and banks specializing in speculation will likely go bankrupt. The Central Bank, which had previously tried to support them, will now "show no mercy."

The second step concerns the control of materials. A "radical" approach has been devised, whereby all essential materials for people's livelihoods will be strictly controlled, with most of them being controlled by the government, no longer allowing them to become commodities for unscrupulous merchants to hoard and profit from. The materials currently hoarded by unscrupulous merchants will be subject to a general inventory of warehouses throughout the city by the Garrison Command, with the mobilization of military police. Materials suspected of being hoarded will be sealed, and then the government will sell them to the citizens of the city at a fair price, while merchants suspected of hoarding will be dealt with by military law for violating the General Mobilization Law.

The measures stipulated in these two steps were taken to Nanjing by Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao, who requested instructions from Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. Governor Zhang is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 1st, and it is expected that the measures can be implemented in the near future.

Regarding the fundamental solutions, Xuan Tie-wu, Wu Guozhen, and Zhang Jia'ao jointly drafted them and submitted them to the Chairman in Nanjing for approval. It is reported that the content is roughly to implement a rationing system for daily necessities to thoroughly solve the people's livelihood problems.

### Steel-Coated Paper Wastes Foreign Exchange; Tinfoil Industry Calls for Restrictions

[Our News] The Shanghai Tinfoil Industry Association held an emergency appeal to newspaper reporters last night, stating that the imported steel-coated paper used for cigarettes is flooding the market, affecting the industry's survival. The association urged all Chinese cigarette factories to adhere to the principles of patriotism and frugality and to use domestically produced tinfoil as much as possible to maintain the national industry. According to Gao Wenliang, the chairman of the association, cigarette tinfoil was originally supplied by domestic tinfoil manufacturers, but it has been replaced by imported steel-coated paper since its import. After the victory, the government was well aware that steel-coated paper is a luxury item, so it did not provide foreign exchange for its import, but smuggled goods still flowed into Shanghai. Furthermore, the Swiss-owned China Aluminum Steel Products Factory in Shanghai, which originally manufactured steel products needed by Chinese people as its main business, has also recently switched to producing steel-coated paper in large quantities, putting the domestic tinfoil industry in a precarious situation. Tinfoil is superior to steel-coated paper in terms of moisture and mildew resistance, except for its lack of gloss. It is also cheaper than steel-coated paper on the black market. However, cigarette factories compete for vanity and would rather abandon cheap tinfoil and use steel-coated paper instead. According to statistics for the eight months of this year, the cost has been close to 800 billion. Assuming a USD exchange rate of 50,000, this is equivalent to USD 16 million, which could buy 1,600 airplanes, 16,000 cars, or 40,000 tons of merchant ships. If we do not use steel-coated paper, national defense construction could be completed after one year, establishing a strong country. The industry now requests: Cigarette factories should wake up and use domestic products, which will not only protect the tinfoil industry and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers but also save a large amount of foreign exchange and strengthen national defense construction. Please ask the government to restrict the large-scale production of the China Aluminum Steel Products Factory, and the total sales should not exceed 20% of the market demand. Request the government to allocate raw materials such as blue aluminum and Yunnan tin to directly reduce production costs and indirectly reduce the burden on consumers.

### Chairman Fang's Resignation Not Approved; Central Government Grants Special Leave for Recuperation; Gui Chongji Resigns as Candidate for National Assembly

[Central News Agency] Chairman Fang of the Municipal Party Department returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after a week in Nanjing. When talking to reporters about his mission to Nanjing and his impressions of the general election, he said: I have been working in Shanghai for more than a year, and I have exhausted my mind and body. Fortunately, the general election is about to be completed, and the party groups have also achieved unity. I went to Nanjing specifically to resign from my current position, hoping to unload my burden. Although my resignation has not been approved, the central government has granted me short leave to rest. The National Assembly elections in various provinces and cities have gone very well. The democratic competition style in Shanghai is particularly praised by the central government. It is hoped that there will be even better performance in the election of legislators in the future, adding glory to Shanghai. As for my election as a representative of the National Assembly in Shanghai, it is entirely the result of the support and care of people from all walks of life and fellow villagers. I am deeply grateful for this kindness, and in the future, I will abide by the original intention of "everyone elects me, and I serve everyone" to serve the people of the city.

Gui Chongji, former president of National Central University, has been living in Shanghai for a long time, focusing on academics. The central government nominated him as a candidate for the National Assembly in Jiangxi because of his reputation. The people of Jiangxi also expressed their support, but Gui had no intention of running. He wrote a special letter to Secretary-General Wu 　Cheng　 to decline the nomination, so as to give way to more capable people.

### Public Training Alumni Leave an Immortal Chapter in the War of Resistance; Martyrs' Memorial Unveiled Yesterday; Wu Tiecheng Comes to Shanghai to Preside Over the Ceremony; General Membership Meeting and Club Opening Held on the Same Day

### Spirit Food for Children: Serial Picture Books Remain Popular

[Our News Special Feature] In Shanghai, any road has at least two serial picture book stalls, and they have ten times more readers than any library every day.

The compilation and drawing of serial picture books are different from ordinary books. Drafting, drawing, scenery, descriptions, supervising the drawing, and publishing are all different jobs. A small booklet of only 140 pages is like filming a 　movie　, requiring the cooperation of more than 　ten　 people to complete. Especially the drawing, which is the core work of serial picture 　books　. Among the eighty-odd illustrators in Shanghai, Shen Manyun and Chen Guangyi's humorous paintings and animal 　pictures　, Yan Shaotang and Zhao Hongben's historical paintings, and Jiang Ping and Li Tiesheng's fashion paintings are the most familiar and admired by children and adult readers of serial picture books. Their every stroke creates countless beautiful fantasies for the children.

A Young Lady Studies Art With A Tutor

Drawing work is the life of serial picture books, so the ranking of practitioners is extremely 　strict　. Those who draw characters are the top tier, those who draw landscapes are second-class, those who draw houses are lower-class, and the lowest class is those who draw window frames and fill in the floor, limited to filling in patterns and lines. Now that the serial picture book industry has developed, several veteran artists have taken on the character of artists, being lazy and producing very little. On the one hand, they also close their doors to recruit apprentices, and those who admire them and ask to join their ranks come in droves. Recently, a young lady is also preparing to study art under Zhang Shaodai, who is now considered the leading figure in the field. "Bi Ruhua," the "serial exhaustive" writer most admired by children, is his disciple. Each time they create, the teacher first conceives the plot, and then assigns the students to draw characters, scenery, and descriptions, dividing the work in order, each performing their own tasks, and then combining them into a complete page.

Eagerly Reading, Paper Becomes As Valuable As In Luoyang

Although "Investiture of the Gods" and "Journey to the West" have been banned, the adapted versions of "Mei Taigong" and "Xuanzang's Trip Abroad" are still among the best-selling books in serial picture books. Three thousand copies per edition have been published three times in the past few months. As for the most popular character recently, it is "Tarzan." Whether "Tarzan" is in danger, saving his son, or suppressing bandits, as long as there is a picture of that invincible and fearless idol, children will rush to read it, and paper becomes as valuable as in Luoyang. The era of spitting out white light and taking people's heads from thousands of miles away is over, but what has replaced it is still a superhuman depiction. According to a parent of an average family, "Little Rascal" comes back from school, his eyebrows furrowed and his arms raised high, yelling and looking for objects to be conquered, which must be after reading something like "Tarzan Pacifies the Barbarians" at the book stall at the school gate. Sometimes "Little Rascal" hides behind the door, pretending to hold a pistol with his fingers, waiting for someone to arrive and suddenly appearing, which must be a review after reading "The Thief Lupin" or "Sherlock Holmes." According to his detailed investigation of the child afterward, it proved to be perfectly accurate.

Striving for Improvement but Suffering Losses

Why do publishers continue to compile and print these almost meaningless serial picture books? According to several publishing booksellers who strive for improvement regardless of sales: Xiyin Bookstore has published "Wen Tianxiang," "The Childhood of the National Father," "The Great Man Roosevelt," and "National Martyr Yan Yingyuan," Meihua Bookstore has published "Ma Zhanshan," "Xianglin Sao," and "The Nanjing Massacre," and Wenhua Bookstore has published "Eight Years of the War of Resistance" and "Teacher of Ten Thousand Generations," and so on, all of which have attempted to break through the shackles of myths and monsters with advanced and novel ideas, but the results have been failures, with dismal sales and unbearable losses. The reason is that young friends do not like this type of book!

Mythical Scripts Are Easier To Approve

Also, when the Social Affairs Bureau reviews the content, mythical and bizarre scripts are easier to pass than biographies and histories. This has a great impact on the psychology of publishers. Biographies require textual research, and the review time is inevitably longer. It is said that Meihua Painting Bureau wanted to publish a book called "Commander Liao" last year, which described Liao Yaoxiang's experience in the War of Resistance. At the beginning of the compilation, it was well-documented and thoroughly researched, but it was only recently approved, with the submission taking more than a year. It is said that many details were carefully considered and revised, which took the most time. For example, in the original manuscript, the soldiers saluted with their left hand, and the review ordered them to change to their right hand. In the draft of Liao Yaoxiang's escape, he was missing a military cap and wearing ragged clothes. The author's intention was to show the circumstances of his hasty breakout, but the Social Affairs Bureau considered that as a soldier, he should be rigorous and orderly even in the face of danger, and his clothes should be neat. Such a picture was simply close to humiliation, so they ordered a fresh start and redrawing. It cost several times the time it took to create mythical drawings.

40% Sold Overseas

Shanghai now has eighty bookstores specializing in publishing serial picture books. From the beginning of last year to the end of August this year, including historical, scientific, ethical, romance, martial arts, humorous, detective, and other categories, a total of more than 1,200 types have been published. It still maintains a production volume of two books per day. If it is summer, children will read them to keep cool, and sales will improve, and production can be increased to four books per day. Ten percent of these illustrated books are sold to Southeast Asia, and 30% are sold to Taiwan. It is said that the overseas Chinese are forcing their children to read them, so that they can savor the real situation of their motherland from the vivid and detailed pictures.

In the noisy and clamorous city, have you ever noticed those children clustered next to the serial picture book stalls in the alleys, using their saved snack money to seek their own luxurious imaginations?

### Chief Prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office Discusses Amnesty for Crimes

Rather Than Releasing Them to Return to Prison, It Is Better to Transfer Them to the Frontier for Reclamation

[Exclusive Interview with Our News] The reporter recently visited Du Baoqi, the chief prosecutor of the High Prosecutor's Office, and asked him about the following three matters: In the amnesty decree issued in this city on New Year's Day, traitors were not granted grace. Recently, it has been reported that some people in the capital have suggested that the government issue another decree on New Year's Day next year, so that traitors can also have the opportunity to be pardoned. It is also said that when 　constitutional　 government is implemented in the future, there will be another amnesty to show a new beginning with the people. Has the chief prosecutor heard of this? The case of Zhang Shankun and others from China Film Corporation, who were attached to the enemy, has been under investigation at the High Prosecutor's Office for a long time. I wonder what the results are? Also, Yue Feng, Li Lihua, and others are also under investigation, but their new film "Three Women" has been released. What is the chief prosecutor's opinion on this? More than a hundred former joint guarantors are accused of colluding with the enemy, involving many famous people in the city. What will the High Prosecutor's Office do about this? Du avoided giving a direct answer to the first question, saying that the matter of amnesty is of great importance and must be decided after the President is elected in the future. However, regarding the amnesty on New Year's Day this year, there is room for discussion. The purpose of the government's promulgation of the amnesty is to give criminals the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves, turn the useless into the useful, and participate in social production. If we evaluate the amnesty on New Year's Day this year in this way, it is clear that it has failed to achieve this goal. Most of those who were pardoned were thieves. After being released from prison, they wandered the streets, and their food, clothing, and shelter became problems. No one in society helped them, so they had to find their "old buddies" and resume their "theft" career to solve their food and clothing problems. Therefore, almost all of them returned to prison soon after their release. It is recalled that in the South City Court, twelve juvenile thieves released in the morning were sent to the court again in the afternoon for theft. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve the effect of clarifying society without fundamentally solving the problem. He believes that the fundamental solution is to "settle the frontier" for homeless criminals, transplanting them to sparsely populated areas, such as Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in the northwest, and desert islands in the sea, so that they can reclaim the land. On the one hand, it can isolate the bad elements from the whole society, and on the other hand, it can strengthen the border areas, encourage them to reclaim wasteland and produce, and turn the useless into the useful. European and American countries often transport criminals by ship to deserted islands for reclamation, which is the same idea. He said that he had contributed this opinion to the judicial authorities, but it was probably not adopted due to the turmoil in the country and the tight financial situation. He hopes that the public will promote it so that it can be implemented.

### Li Lihua and Others Filming Still Shows No Signs of Illegality

Mr. Du, regarding the second question, stated that the case concerning film personnel collaborating with the enemy has not been concluded to this day. The High Prosecutor's Office is also extremely anxious and has repeatedly sent letters to relevant agencies for investigation. However, replies have not been received, hindering the progress of the investigation. Furthermore, the case involves dozens of people, including Zhang Shankun of the puppet China Film Company, and must be resolved as a whole. Due to the incomplete investigation of several individuals, the entire case has been shelved. This is the reason for the delay in the case. As for Yue Feng, Li Lihua, and others, during the investigation period, it cannot be determined that they have committed crimes of communicating with the enemy, and their filming still shows no signs of illegality. Mr. Du, regarding the third question, stated that the case involving over a hundred puppet Lianbao chiefs is also a single case. It must be resolved simultaneously. The investigation focuses on whether these Lianbao chiefs colluded with the enemy during the period of occupation and engaged in conduct detrimental to the people. If there is clear evidence of their crimes, they will be prosecuted.

### Authorities are Intensifying the Investigation of Official-Business Collusion and Embezzlement Case. The Earliest Informant was Lu Genji Construction Company. Yi Feng Firm handled the import of over one hundred billion yuan.

"Our Newspaper News" As of yesterday, most of the perpetrators involved in the major official-business collusion and embezzlement case have been detained by the garrison headquarters. Among them, in addition to Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Xiehui, and Zhang Yuan, who were assistants in the Import Permit Inspection and Valuation Section of the Jianghai Customs, there are also more than ten responsible persons and key employees from four import and export firms. Some of them are detained in the former detention center for traitors in the Nanshi area, while others are still in the Third Inspection Brigade. All are prohibited from seeing family members. Although yesterday was Sunday, Li Xicheng, the section chief of the Ministry of National Defense who was ordered to come to Shanghai for investigation, continued to supervise the above-mentioned relevant agencies to intensify the secret interrogation. According to information obtained by our reporter, the earliest informant in this case was Lu Genji Construction Company. However, the points they accused were not as "significant" as those discovered after the current thorough investigation. In particular, there are many people involved in the import and export firms related to this case. Taking Yi Feng Firm at No. 413, Citibank Building, Jiujiang Road, as an example, the value of imported materials handled through embezzlement and deceptive practices has reached over one hundred billion yuan. Therefore, after the manager of the firm, Mao Fengxiang, was arrested on the evening of the 24th, many important employees of the firm were also detained the next day. From Mao's confession, three import and export customs declaration firms were also implicated. These three firms are still under investigation, so it is not convenient to disclose the names of the companies and the names of the arrested persons. As for the involvement of individuals with military status, relevant personnel did not confirm this yesterday, or it may be a warehouse official of a certain unit.

### Carrying Zhang Shi's "Handwritten Order" to Scare and Extort the Bathhouse Owner. Impersonating a Police Officer Led to Capture

"Our Newspaper News" Sun Baofa, nicknamed "Little Wuxi," operates Anlechi Bathhouse at No. 35 Yunnan South Road. He used to have an opium addiction but has quit. Unexpectedly, in the middle of last month, three men claiming to be plainclothes police officers, carrying a handwritten order from Zhang Shi, the deputy director of the police station, went to Sun's residence at No. 4 Yongye Lane, Baxianqiao, firmly insisting that Sun was still addicted to drugs and wanted to take him to the station for detention and interrogation. After Sun repeatedly stated that he had quit and asked for help, the three men left. They came again on the morning of the 27th. Because Sun was out on business, his wife received them. Negotiations began, demanding several "notes" (meaning bribes) to settle the case. His wife was anxious and helpless, so she called her husband's friend, Lu Yongxing, for help. Lu is an employee of Anshang Inn on Yunnan South Road and is quite familiar with the personnel of the police station. He rushed to Sun's house and greeted the visitors. One claimed to be Zheng Ziliang, the section chief of the detective division, and another claimed to be detective Wang Lin. Lu, knowing that there were no such personnel in the detective division of the police station, immediately called a friend in the detective division of the general bureau to inquire. It was immediately confirmed that there was no such case and no such person. The division immediately sent personnel to Sun's house to arrest the three men who were impersonating police officers. After interrogation, they confessed: "We originally served in the police force, but we were dismissed this spring due to a case. In extreme poverty, we resorted to this behavior of borrowing a name to swindle and deceive." Deputy Director Zhang believes that since the criminals dared to forge his handwritten order to defraud people, if they are not severely punished, how can we warn others? He has ordered his subordinates to handle the case strictly according to the law.

### Kicking to Death Case. Portuguese Police Not Guilty? Lotus Mountain Bandit Ship Disguised as Inspection Boat Attempted to Attack Wuxue Ship, Unsuccessful

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 30th Dispatch] The third session of the first Guangdong Provincial Assembly is scheduled to open on the 1st, and the main topics for discussion will be public security and official governance. Song Ziwen will attend to report on provincial affairs.

The Guangzhou Newspaper Association previously sent Liang Feng and others to Beijing to appeal to the government to increase the allocation of paper. Liang and others have now returned to Guangzhou on the 29th. The results of this trip are extremely satisfactory.

According to unofficial sources: The Guangzhou Headquarters, in order to accelerate the suppression of banditry on land and water in Guangdong Province, has specifically scheduled a Guangdong Provincial Water and Land Transportation Pacification Conference to be held on the 3rd of next month. In addition, the Guangzhou Headquarters has formally ordered the Navy's 6th Artillery Unit to fully suppress the Huashan bandits who endanger the water transportation routes between Hong Kong and Guangdong, and has set a deadline of half a month for their elimination. Also, the Wuxue ship traveling between Hong Kong and Guangdong was attacked by a bandit ship disguised as a customs inspection boat on the Lianhua Mountain river surface yesterday. Fortunately, the customs anti-smuggling ship happened to pass by at this time, and the bandit ship fled in panic upon hearing the news.

The Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to reduce expenditures and enhance work efficiency, has decided to reduce redundant positions in provincial and county agencies starting next month. Each county government will reduce the organization to two departments and two offices based on the actual situation to save expenses and increase the salaries of public officials at all levels.

### Miscellaneous Election News from Various Places

### General Election in Hong Kong. Staging Strange Dramas Such as "Elephants Crossing the River"

[Our Newspaper Hong Kong 26th Dispatch] The news of the first nationwide general election on the 21st was overshadowed by the wedding news of British Princess Elizabeth in Hong Kong, which was listed as a difficult election area! Public opinion in Hong Kong and China on the holding of the general election in the mainland only made general reviews based on the situation in the mainland. Everyone kept silent about the temporary loss of precious voting rights by millions of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, as if there was something unsaid. Before the Hong Kong government officially expressed its attitude and prohibited overseas Chinese from holding elections in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong District Election Affairs Office set up in the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce had attracted widespread attention. In the past, many giants in the Hong Kong and Chinese business circles were interested in the National Assembly representatives. The election of the chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce a month ago had sparked the most intense competition in history for this reason. Two leaders of the Hong Kong and Chinese women's circles had publicly expressed their participation in the National Assembly election and attacked each other. One accused the other of "elephants crossing the river" because she came from Guangzhou, and the other accused the other of being protected by the puppet government because some of the directors of a girls' middle school she ran were puppet figures. And some figures who traveled between Hong Kong and Guangdong, the "good shows" they painstakingly created could not be staged in time. How sad they must be these days to see the news of other places announcing the results of the election in the newspapers! (Special Correspondent Zijiang)

### Authorities Plan to Implement Full Control: Set Prices for Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Will Start with Centralized Purchase and Allocation of Cotton from Various Regions

[Our Report] After the change of the head of the Textile Council, there is a determination to change the previously stalled joint distribution pilot program for cotton yarn to a full control of cotton yarn and cloth. The general idea is to ensure the cost of reproduction for each manufacturer, hoping that all manufacturers related to cotton yarn and cloth can embody the government's aim of stabilizing prices, sacrificing personal interests, and making cotton yarn and cloth reach a stable situation.

It is heard that this comprehensive control policy will start from the centralized purchase of cotton, the centralized allocation of raw cotton, to the centralized purchase and sale of yarn and cloth. It will be implemented simultaneously in the major cotton yarn and cloth centers across the country, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, etc., to seek thorough implementation and unified government orders. General observations indicate that the recent fluctuations in prices have been primarily influenced by cotton yarn and cloth. If the price of cotton yarn and cloth can be stabilized comprehensively, it will be of great help to the overall price stability policy.

However, according to related parties' speculations, private yarn factories in this area already have many opinions on the implementation of the joint distribution pilot program. Once a full control of yarn and cloth is implemented, there may be concerns that it will be difficult to operate. However, for the sake of the overall price policy, this comprehensive control policy is necessary to be thoroughly implemented.

### If Rayon Re-Sales Resume This Week: Suspended Quotas Can Still Be Supplemented: And Will Be Calculated at 80% of Market Price in Principle

Before the new distribution method of the Social Affairs Bureau is decided, sales will be temporarily suspended. The suspension has lasted for three weeks. According to the person in charge of the bureau to the reporter, whether the bureau's rayon will resume sales this week will depend on whether the distribution method set by the Social Affairs Bureau has been approved and sent to the bureau. If it is received, it will be distributed immediately in accordance with the method. The amount of the previous three weeks of suspended distribution can still be supplemented in full. The distribution price will still be calculated based on 80% of the average weekly market price in principle. The 4,500 boxes of rayon shipped from Japan have arrived in Shanghai and were stored in the warehouse three days ago.

### Authorities Suppress Prices: Will Continue to Tighten Credit: Rumors of Issuing 50,000 Yuan Notes Are Absolutely Groundless

According to the person in charge of the relevant authorities in this city, the Central Bank's recent efforts to suppress prices and strictly tighten credit have achieved considerable results. Some speculative merchants deliberately spread rumors that the National Bank's tightening of credit this time is a prelude to the upcoming issuance of 50,000 yuan notes, in order to disturb people's minds. In fact, the authorities have taken this measure with the great determination to suppress prices, and the facts will prove that the above rumors are absolutely groundless. If these speculative merchants continue to stir up trouble and do not restrain themselves, they will surely suffer the consequences.

[Our Report] In view of the solid foundation of industry and mining in Taiwan, the China Industrial and Mining Construction Association has launched the organization of a Taiwan Industrial and Mining Inspection Group to serve as a mirror for military inspection. The group is led by Lei Zhen, director of the association, and Pu Xinya as the deputy head. The members include Li Lixia, Wang Zhuyi, Li Zai, Fan Heyan, Shen Rixin, Gu Zhuhong, Zhang Shulin, Wang Zhenhai, Jiang Dingwu, Lu Rongguang, Wang Boheng, Chen Baohua, Hu Guoliang, Liu Nianyi, Chen Jingmin, Tang Xiongjun, Liao Yunshi, and other 32 people, all of whom are leaders in the financial, industrial, and commercial circles. Director Lei of the group has already contacted Chairman Wei of the Taiwan Province by letter and telegram, and plans to depart in early this month to visit various important industries in Taiwan, staying for about a week.

The China Industrial and Mining Construction Association aims to connect people from the financial, technical, and business sectors to promote China's industrial and mining undertakings. Most of China's general industrial and mining groups are specialized organizations, and the establishment of this association has great value and significance. Therefore, when the association was established in Chongqing on February 2, 1944, more than 500 people participated. It has successively founded a technical service agency and a joint factory and mine office, and has devoted itself to various movements to promote industrial and mining construction. It has greatly benefited the encouragement and support of the rear industrial and mining industries during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory and restoration, due to the dispersal of directors, supervisors, and members in various places, the association's affairs were slightly suspended. Now, Chairman Chen of the association, Lei Zhen, Xu Enhui, Cai Shuhou, Wu Yourong, and others have agreed to actively resume the association's activities, intending to register old members, solicit new members, convene the Second Congress of Members, and plan to set up the head office in Shanghai.

### Government Attempts to Encourage Export of Materials

Recently, due to high costs, the export of tung oil, pig bristles, tea, cotton textiles, and other export commodities has been mostly stagnant and impossible to export. The central authorities have taken note of this and ordered the Export Control Committee to find ways to improve the situation and assist exporters in earning foreign exchange. The committee recently convened a meeting of export leaders to exchange views. They felt distressed because of the fluctuations in the black market exchange rate. Although the current exchange rate has been adjusted, it is still far from being sufficient. The Export Control Committee authorities promised to assist in seeking to restore the export of various materials.

In addition, the authorities decided to export a large amount of yarn and cloth, and cotton textiles through the textile export committee mechanism. According to the person in charge of the association, the association recently decided to export various finished products such as 1,120 bales of cotton yarn. In addition, there are 30,000 bales of cotton with self-prepared foreign exchange without a license. After entrusting various yarn factories to spin yarn and cloth, they will handle the export.

Another report: The Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association recently convened a meeting of the standing directors to discuss the topic of opening up the difficult situation in light of the rampant black market exchange rate and rising prices, which have caused the export business to fall into a stagnant and sluggish state. At that time, Ye Xuyu, the standing director of the association, was publicly recommended to prepare opinions and detailed plans for reforming and promoting the export business, and will submit them to the relevant authorities as a reference for policy implementation.

### Soap and Matches Both Decline: Kerosene and Candles Are Relatively Good

The soap market among daily necessities is sluggish due to tight capital among its peers. Traders are watching and waiting, and scattered sales are not uncommon. Fixed price Gu Ben soap, Huang Xiangmao, Niu Pai, and other soaps have also dropped by about 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.

Matches: Meili Phoenix, Pingding, and new brand goods have fallen by 50,000 to 120,000.

Kerosene supply cannot meet demand. Mobil and Asia have risen to 470,000 per can. Candles have risen by 30,000 per box due to increased costs.

### On "Melancholy Sensuality"

— Mei Bai

When the suicide case of Xiao Danggui was publicly tried, the audience was surprisingly packed, "the courthouse square was filled" (see Shen Bao, November 28th), and some people even "broke into" the solemn courtroom to see Zhang Chunfan, resulting in their arrest. On the surface, this is just a manifestation of Shanghai people's love for novelty and excitement; but, looking at it deeply and remotely, it is really a bit chilling.

Xiao Danggui's mood before and after her suicide is not difficult to imagine. She didn't read much, was content with her lot, and even if she suffered all kinds of embarrassing torments, she would at most cry and die, and did not seek legal relief through a lawyer. But, why did a fairly popular celebrity die so easily? In my opinion, the plots of the plays she starred in are a major reason.

Try flipping through the Yue Opera advertisements. Almost every play is a tragedy, and the most used promotional phrases on the advertisements are "melancholy sensuality" and "always poignant." A while ago, there was also the use of the famous phrase "bitterness is the result of bitterness." It seems that as long as a play can make the audience cry like a spring, it is a great success. Xiao Danggui starred in Leng Shan's "The Flower of Wrath" is one example. I haven't seen this play, but it can be seen from Zhang Chunfan's few words of confession. He said that the content of the play is "about a concubine being seduced and committing suicide as a result." On the one hand, Xiao Danggui inevitably had some feeling of being in the same boat as the heroine of this play, and on the other hand, the heroine's way out in this play certainly had a subliminal effect. The plot of this play is toxic, and what really instigated Xiao Danggui's suicide was precisely the toxin of this play!

Xiao Danggui's death unfortunately strengthened the power of this toxin. Many theaters are already staging plays with her suicide as the theme every day. Of course, the advertisements are again full of words such as "melancholy sensuality." This toxin is expanding and penetrating deeper into the hearts of many housewives and female students who may not read much. The power of "suggestion" is so deep, and in this era of chaos and famine, "stimulation" is never in short supply. The combination of accumulated "suggestion" and "stimulation" may have unimaginable results.

Drama is the most direct form of propaganda, and the prosperity of a country's national fortune is most clearly reflected in its drama. After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, what is needed today is a grand spirit and a pioneering spirit; we really have no reason to tolerate things like "melancholy sensuality" anymore!

### Paper Talk

— Jingwen

What is paper?

Of course, I, I can easily answer: this is what this article is printed on, what you used to write a letter yesterday, and what the newspaper vendor sends to your house every morning.

But, not long ago, someone went to Appleton in Washington to see a strange house. After three years of cold and heat, the house still stood unscathed despite the rain and sun. However, that house was made entirely of paper - the roof, the walls, the floor, everything was paper.

A grain merchant in the Midwest of the United States also had his own special experience. Once, a storm destroyed the roof of his warehouse, and hundreds of bags of grain were stored inside paper bags. A rainstorm soaked all the uncovered things. But was the grain spoiled? Not at all, no water damage.

Recently, I heard that paper curtains are already on sale. The master of a house was sitting reading his evening newspaper, and the phone rang. He put his cigarette in the ashtray to answer the phone. A gust of wind blew the paper curtain onto the ashtray. But there was only a scorch mark on the curtain, and no other household disaster occurred.

Paper has undergone more than one revolution in its historical process. First, it made the spread of writing possible; second, it provided a wrapping material without which modern department stores could not exist. Today it is creating a third revolution, the result of which will completely change our past concept of paper.

Paper scientists declare that the days are not far off when we will wear paper clothes, eat from paper bowls, walk on paper carpets, sleep on paper sheets, and live in paper houses.

Some of these new paper products have already appeared on the market and will greatly reduce your financial burden, because the manufacturing process of paper is the simplest of all manufacturing processes, so the cost is also low.

But how can you turn paper into what you want? This is precisely the secret to the paper scientists' paper revolution. You just need to understand certain chemicals, and your paper immediately becomes more than ordinary paper.

There is a moisture-resistant paper that already has many uses, such as wiping car windows, and the paper used by the U.S. Navy during the war to wipe optical instruments. There is also a super-strong paper towel that is stronger than ordinary towels. Even more rare is a paper that is non-greasy and can be washed with soap and water.

There are also paper bibs for children. This stuff is absorbent and cheap, and can be thrown away after one use. Paper aprons for housewives are soft, washable, and non-flammable.

Fireproof paper is also a great miracle of modern industry. Many of the gun covers used by the U.S. military during the war used this fireproof paper.

But the most noteworthy is paper cloth, which may revolutionize clothing. In the near future, there will be a paper cloth shirt. Because it is cheap, you may throw it away after wearing it once. Paper raincoats will soon replace glass raincoats, and paper galoshes will rival rubber galoshes.

Do you hate flies? Wallpaper treated with DDT can solve this problem for you.

Paper has contributed to human civilization for thousands of years, but now it is starting a new revolution and will become a powerful rival in the world of polymers, textiles, and light metals.

### Miscellaneous Notes from the Mouse Lair

— Yu Shou

The Stone Artifacts of Tan’s Tomb and Su Shun

In the 19th year of the Republic, the translation group of the Examination Yuan dreamed and the government ordered a state funeral. At the time, the person who designed the mausoleum's architecture considered that since the site was near the sacred resting place of the National Father (Sun Yat-sen), it would not be able to surpass it in height or grandeur. Therefore, they sought to establish a unique style through gentle and subtle shifts in the terrain, hence the tomb's particularly rich garden-like atmosphere.

The design of this tomb has an abundance of tranquility but lacks sufficient loftiness and solemnity, reflecting the magnanimity of the Prime Minister. However, the stone artifacts in front of the tomb, from the ornamental columns to the kneeling figures and upturned bowls, are almost all exquisite pieces. Upon first seeing them, one was surprised by the exceptional craftsmanship and discerning eye. Later, it was learned that they were moved from the tomb of Su Shun in Changping. Some say they were purchased from Su Shun's descendants for two thousand gold pieces; others say they were given by the Beiping Antiquities Preservation Committee without any payment. Many years have passed, and it is impossible to determine which account is true. However, adorning Tan's tomb with the relics of Su Shun, if Chaling (Tan Yankai) knew beneath the earth, he would undoubtedly be perplexed and lament.

Regarding the re-evaluation of historical figures, focusing on the late Qing Dynasty, Su Shun deserves primary re-evaluation. I believe this man had brains and shoulders; his fault lay in his arrogance, underestimating his peers in the court, which led to their collective attack and his inability to escape political encirclement. If the Empress Dowagers of the East and West had not abandoned the late Emperor Xianfeng's edict and entrusted him with affairs of state, although it is impossible to know the changes in Gui Lai’s schemes, the political landscape would have been different. At the very least, it would have been possible to curtail the rise of the Western Empress Dowager's power, which would have objectively benefited the overall situation of the Qing Dynasty.

Wang Xiangyi, widely known to have been favored by Su Shun, wrote in his diary in the seventh month of the tenth year of Tongzhi about the desolate state of Su Shun's former residence in Erlongkeng, expressing deep sorrow. He sent a letter to Su Shun's second son to discuss the matter, but the latter declined to come, citing the lack of proper attire. Xiangyi was moved to lament, saying, "The bannermen still cling to their habits of ostentation... There is no way to help them recover." Only ten years after Su Shun was executed, his descendants had become so impoverished. Therefore, it is not impossible that they would sell their ancestor's tomb artifacts for two thousand gold pieces twenty years after the Republic.

Weng Changshu's diary also contains many records of Su Shun, referring to him as "Lord Su." His record of the palace examination in the thirteenth year of Xianfeng includes the phrase "Lord Su gave orders with his eyes and gestures, treating scholars like slaves." This man had extraordinary talent but lacked sufficient scholarship. His unbridled arrogance undoubtedly caused resentment among his peers, and the seeds of his downfall were already sown.

### Ten Years a Slave Girl

— Meng Long

Reading the newspaper, I learned that Xiao Dan Gui, who recently committed suicide by swallowing Lysol, was a "popular" "Red Actress" of the "De Du class". Now, reading the reports in various newspapers about the preliminary trial of Zhang Chunfan, I suddenly realized that the so-called "Red Actress" was actually a female slave. Why call her a female slave? This can be understood simply by looking at Zhang Chunfan's testimony. He said, "(I) and Xiao are from the same village and have known each other for ten years. I bought her in X County."

Xiao Dan Gui's tragedy did not begin today; it can be said to have "long been in the making," because Xiao Dan Gui was truly a "dead soul," and Zhang Chunfan, who had "known her for ten years," had indeed been living a Gogol-esque dream for ten years. Now, due to Xiao's suicide, Zhang Chunfan has finally awakened. Upon awakening, he finds himself in court, facing legal accusations, moral condemnation, and emotional suffering, which is entirely "deserved"!

One witness made a very interesting statement, saying that Xiao Dan Gui's suicide was due to a "change of heart." According to his speculation, Xiao Dan Gui wanted to be nice to Leng Shan, but she didn't dare, leaving her with only suicide as an option. Under the severe and coarse oppression of the Gogol-esque Zhang Chunfan, it is obviously questionable whether Xiao Dan Gui could have developed love for him. I even question whether she understood love or experienced love. Coincidentally, a third party, the married Leng Shan, entered the picture, which was "just the right time." He gave her intellectual nourishment, artistic cultivation, and a taste of life. Their various social activities, such as watching plays, taking walks, chatting, and corresponding, gradually became commonplace. Zhang Chunfan angrily said, "You think this is ordinary, but I think it is extraordinary!" Xiao Dan Gui, influenced by feudal toxins, vacillated, struggling between old and new ideas and emotions, seemingly unable to find knowledge, unable to find art, unable to find love, unable to find life, unable to find a way out, only vaguely feeling that "it's hard to be a person," "it's hard to be a good person," and therefore "died."

Female slaves like Xiao Dan Gui, who spend ten years or a lifetime in a dream, are not uncommon. However, those who take a step forward after awakening and refuse to bow their heads and retreat or raise their heads and advance further are truly rare, which is regrettable.

### Lament of the Banished Immortal

— Wen Jie

The other day, I watched the film "Lament of the Banished Immortal." In it, one of the female characters (playing Lawrence) described the musician Louis with a phrase, saying that he was "a little off the earth," seemingly of the eccentric kind. Someone has defined "poetry" as follows: poetry is the diary of an aquatic animal that has left the water to live on land and yet wants to fly in the sky. This speaks of poets.

However, the body ultimately cannot leave the Earth, so Maupassant said: "We only need to think a little to know that this world is very unsuitable for animals like us. Thought makes those of us who have knowledge forever miserable exiles on Earth" (or refugees; this term seems to imply the meaning of a god being banished to Earth).

Although humans today claim to have thousands of years of history, in the developmental history of the entire universe, today's so-called humans are still just a kind of animal lingering between "human" and "beast." "Human face and beast heart" and "dressed in clothes, but beasts" must be the adjectives for this kind of animal. Of course, this is said from the human standpoint; otherwise, it is quite debatable whether a human face is necessarily more elegant than a beast face, or whether clothing is necessarily more convenient than fur. However, due to some kind of "transgressive evolution," a small number of a certain type of animal that exists between "god" and "human" may occasionally be found among humans; they wander between the heavens and the mundane world—although born on Earth, they do not belong to Earth. In history, we can sometimes see people of this type. These people are born too peacefully and too early, several thousand years too early; it is probably not very easy to succeed in this world. Confucius and Jesus belong to this group, as do Socrates, Galileo, Copernicus, Martin Luther... Look at the fate these people suffered! They are fish out of water, very uncoordinated in the human world; if they still want to fly off the ground, then they will inevitably be regarded as absurd monsters and shot at by social elites. People today often say that "the world's customs are not as ancient as they used to be," and they inevitably grumble in their hearts about those who are so-called "ancient ways are worthy of admiration," meaning that the era of that "ancient way" has passed. In this era, where one has to fight even one's own shadow, the unsuitability of such people is real, but it is not necessarily true that the era of that ancient way has passed; human hearts and minds may not have been more ancient than pigs. The "ancient age" we imagine has probably not yet arrived. Hugo said: In today's world, the Kingdom of Heaven has not yet been moved to Earth.

In general, the deeper one is in the human world, the farther one is from the Kingdom of Heaven. Children, before their knowledge opens up, are a kind of angel between "god" and "human." Although the Kingdom of Heaven is not outside, they still vacillate between "heaven" and "earth." There is a saying in the Bible: "The road to the Kingdom of Heaven is straight, but narrow." I think only children who have not lost their childishness have hope of reaching there. Great people's bodies appear too... However, children will eventually become adults. From this, one can imagine that the population of the Kingdom of Heaven must be sparse.

### Unfettered Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter One: Happy to Find a Soulmate (1)

For people in the Pear Garden world (Chinese Opera), the most precious thing is a good voice. If you have a good voice and work hard, everything will be smooth. If you don't have a good voice, it's called "having no capital" in the business. Without capital, no matter how innovative you are, you will always be inferior in art. Therefore, those who are particular about singing pay attention to their voices with all their spirit. Beiping (Beijing) is the birthplace of famous actors of the Jingchao (Beijing Opera) school. Whether you are an old performer or a beginner apprentice, if you want a clear and bright voice, you must warm up your voice every day. Those living in Beiping often climb to a high building at dawn and listen carefully. Sharps and long cries can be heard in the air. Those who don't know may think it's the whistling of pig herders, but insiders can tell that it's the sound of warming up voices. These people who warm up their voices in the morning mostly choose places with open spaces, such as Tiananmen Square, Zhongshan Park, and the Temple of Heaven in Beiping, which are convenient locations with fresh air. Warming up one's voice by the water, by the corner of a wall, on a hillside, or under a tree, and singing a few lines, will not only improve one's voice day by day, but also greatly benefit one's body by humming and singing in the clear morning air. Therefore, tourists in the Temple of Heaven and Zhongshan Park often hear very pleasant and melodious singing in the morning. Most old Beiping people are accustomed to it and are not very interested in these warm-ups and scattered sounds. When tourists newly arrived from the South hear these sounds, they can't help but be surprised, searching for the source of the sound to see who is warming up their voice and singing.

This day was already after the Frost's Descent solar term. The climate in Beiping is different from that in the South. As soon as the autumn message arrives, it is the west wind rolling, and yellow leaves flying. Although Zhongshan Park is full of autumn colors, on the earth mountain west of the waterside pavilion, among the verdant cypress trees, there was a young man in his twenties, wearing a straight Western suit, walking back and forth on the narrow mountain path, concentrating on imitating the Mei style’s Yutangchun. Before he could finish singing a passage, there was a rustling sound in the mountain path. A girl of twelve or thirteen years old, followed by a sweet and pretty young lady, emerged from among the trees, staring at the young man. The girl's bright eyes looked at the young man a few times, then leaned close to the young lady's ear, seemingly whispering something. The young man felt disturbed by their presence, interrupting his artistic enjoyment. He stopped warming up his voice and slowly walked down the mountain path. Passing through a small pavilion, he vaguely saw a woman hiding behind the mountain rocks, temporarily ignoring her. He hurried to the Moon Gate on the back river, practiced his voice for a while under a row of persimmon trees, facing the corner of the vermilion wall, and sang the unfinished passage of Yutangchun again. Just as he finished singing the passage, he suddenly heard applause behind him, thinking that someone was disturbing him again. Turning around, frowning, he saw that it was his uncle-in-law, Lu Xiaobo, hurriedly walking over. Xiaobo smiled and said, "Shuwei, you've been singing even better lately!" Shuwei hurriedly smiled and said, "I'm just singing randomly. Uncle-in-law, if you see anything wrong, please give me some guidance." Before Xiaobo could answer, a young girl walked out of the woods across from them and shouted to Xiaobo, "Boss Xiao! Why are you out so early today?" Xiaobo said, "I've been suffering from insomnia lately, and my appetite isn't good. The doctor advised me to come out for a walk. I went home from the park yesterday and haven't slept since!"

### Dispute Over Land Leasing When Landlords Reclaim Land for Self-Cultivation and Tenants Refuse to Vacate

Yang of Songjiang: My friend Zhang owns more than ten acres of land, which he leased to others for cultivation and entered into a contract. Now my friend wants to reclaim the land for self-cultivation, but the tenant refuses to return the land, and the two parties are almost involved in litigation. I have several legal questions and would appreciate it if your lawyer could provide answers. Thank you very much. The lease states "The land cannot be leased to others except when the owner reclaims it for self-cultivation" and "The rent in rice can be required from the tenant when returning the land." Based on the above two points, can the tenancy be revoked and the tenant be required to return the land? The tenant has not paid rent for many years before the war. This contract was signed after the war. Can he refuse to vacate? Some say that old tenants do not pay the rent for the year when they leave. The new contract was signed in 1945. Can we deny that he is an old tenant? Is the tenant refusing to vacate an act of coercion, given that there was a notice to vacate beforehand? Does the tenant have the right to prevent it? How should we respond if he refuses to vacate?

"Lawyer Duanben answers:" If it is an indefinite lease of cultivated land, the landlord can reclaim it for self-cultivation according to Article 114 of the Land Law, and it is also legal to request rent payment. Not acceptable. Not acceptable. This kind of... cannot be applied. Therefore, there is no! deny that he is an old tenant. Since there was an agreement beforehand, there must be no behavior contrary to the contract. No right to prevent it. File a lawsuit to confirm that the lease is terminated according to law.

### Frequency Modulation

— Yu

In today's era of rapid advances in wireless electricity, we are all keenly aware of the great distress caused by receiver distortion and atmospheric static. Often, when we listen to the radio, we hear sounds that do not resemble the original music, or we hear jarring, cacophonous noises that make our ears ring and make us feel uncomfortable. We know that the origin of these problems does not lie in the receiver or the transmitter, but is a major shortcoming of the currently prevalent amplitude modulation (AM) system, and is also an obstacle to the current broadcasting industry. Because people want to remedy the above shortcomings, frequency modulation (FM) was invented.

In an AM transmitter, a high-frequency current is generated by an oscillator and a low-frequency signal. This low-frequency signal changes with the strength of the sound. We use this low-frequency current to vary the screen voltage in the modulator vacuum tube, thus changing the amplitude of the output current of this vacuum tube. After working at a large scale, it is transmitted on the antenna. But these works have a problem; this is when the amplitude-modulated wave encounters static electricity in the air. Since the amplitude of static electricity is similar to that of the amplitude-modulated wave, the two waves mix and enter the receiver at the same time, and the detector stage in the receiver cannot completely remove it, allowing it to freely enter the loudspeaker through the amplifier tube, and thus the rasping, jarring noise is produced.

This phenomenon does not occur in FM systems, because FM systems use the different strengths of sound to vary the frequency of the radio waves transmitted into the air within a certain limit. The extent of this change is the sidebands in the AM system. If a carrier wave is amplitude-modulated by sound, it becomes three parts, one of which is the original frequency, one is higher than the original frequency, and one is lower than the original frequency. As for the numerical value, it depends on the frequency of the amplitude modulation. The FM frequency uses all three parts, but keeps the wave amplitude constant. Common FM oscillating circuits use the Hartley type, which uses the low-frequency radio waves in the microphone to change the grid voltage of the reactance tube, and then outputs it from the screen of this tube and enters the grid of the oscillating tube, so that the frequency in the oscillating tube changes indirectly by the low-frequency radio waves in the microphone. In this way, after frequency doubling and amplification, this kind of constant-amplitude wave can be output from the antenna. On the receiver side, FM receivers add a limiter stage and a frequency detection stage, also called a discriminator, in addition to ordinary receivers. Because the amplitude of the received wave may vary, the amplitude of its precursor waves through the limiting stage is very stable, and then it goes through the frequency detection stage or amplifies the echo. In the above work, static electricity, although it enters the antenna, cannot pass through the limiting stage, because extremely high and low amplitudes cannot pass, and even if they can pass, they are negligible. In this way, there will be no jarring, cacophonous sounds in the receiver's loudspeaker.

The advantages of FM are not only that it can avoid interference from static electricity, but also the following:

First, in terms of power and range, we all hope to minimize the power of the transmitter as much as possible, so that savings can be achieved and the range can be doubled. The FM system can meet our ideals. For example, an FM transmitter can have a range hundreds of times greater than an AM transmitter of the same power.

Second, two or more FM radio stations can use the same frequency and broadcast simultaneously. If they are spaced apart appropriately, the receiver will not be affected. But this is not the case with AM radio stations. The receiver often receives signals from two radio stations, confusing them. However, FM requires a large frequency width, so it is suitable for high frequency bands, such as the 88 to 108 MHz band, where more than 4,000 FM radio stations can be set up.

Third, AM systems change the range of their required amplitude, and these radio waves cannot suit the various components of the original music and perfectly transmit them. Therefore, there is a phenomenon of distortion. FM radio waves change with the width of the frequency. In low-frequency music, both the pitch and timbre can be transmitted by this frequency change without losing any of this beautiful music. When we listen, it feels like we are hearing it directly.

Fourth, in AM systems, the variation of amplitude causes each vacuum tube to change its characteristics according to the power size. In FM systems, because the wave amplitude is constant, the vacuum tubes can maximize their working efficiency to the point of perfection. The FM system was invented by Professor Armstrong of the United States as early as ten years ago. At the time, when he advocated replacing the AM system with the FM system, it was of course not valued by people. Later, after his unremitting efforts, he finally succeeded. That year was 1935. His first FM transmitter was built, with a power of 2 million watts. At that time, he used more than seventy vacuum tubes, and the frequency was 44 MHz. Today, the number of vacuum tubes used in FM transmitters has gradually been reduced to twenty, and the power is only 50,000 watts. In the near future, the current AM system can often be replaced.

### Fluorine

— Hong En

The "Bad Guy" of the Elements

Halogens are a stubborn family. As chemists say, they are powerful and unpredictable. Like the famous "members" chlorine and bromine, they were only tamed a short time ago, and now their fierce nature has turned into a useful element.

Centuries ago, chemists were thinking about how to make chlorine work, but this element is extremely dangerous. Once it encounters hydrogen, it turns into hydrofluoric acid—scientifically one of the most destructive reactions.

Now, after years of arduous experimentation, science has transformed this troublemaker into a useful citizen, a major component in insecticides, plastics, and refrigerating liquids. Fluorine can also be used to make brilliant dyes, protect oils (preventing them from oxidizing), and in high voltage, make a gas almost a perfect insulator—an excellent bactericide, improved fumigation and disinfection, a solvent, a fire-resistant substance, and rosin. Fluorine: in these past few years, it has transformed from a devil to an angel. This colorless gas, heavier than air and irritating, ranks twentieth in abundance among the elements.

From 1670 to 1886, the brightest chemical minds were in a race to isolate pure fluorine, until an obscure French chemist, Henri Moissan, solved the problem in 1886 by using electrolysis to isolate fluorine.

Now, after many erroneous experiments, a practical method has finally been found to produce elemental fluorine on a large scale. A specially designed electrolytic cell containing potassium fluoride and oxygen fluoride is used, with the temperature maintained at around 100 degrees Celsius. During electrolysis, hydrogen and chlorine gases are produced. The special design prevents fluorine and hydrogen from combining, as such a combination would cause a large explosion, potentially destroying the fluorine equipment.

Researchers attempted to store the electrolytically produced fluorine in a suitable container for sale, but steel and copper were found to be corroded by fluorine under normal pressure, making container preparation impossible. Only after detailed research was it proven that a type of gasket (made of rubber, etc.) could both not react with fluorine and prevent any fluorine leakage after packaging. When sold, it is only a small amount of fluorine, packaged in cylinders—about one and a half pounds of fluorine under four hundred pounds of pressure.

This pure fluorine has strange properties. Its atoms are very sociable, rushing to find chemical friends. Because of their haste, they often destroy other stable substances. For example, fluorine reacts with silicon to form a gas, and fluorine also absorbs hydrogen extremely easily, even more readily than air.

When a cylinder of fluorine gas is released, whether it touches glass, asbestos, or rock, it always turns into a cloud of smoke. They are all mixtures of silicon, so they react very easily with fluorine. If fluorine is sprayed on water, it will drive away the air and combine with hydrogen, thus emitting a strong, thick smoke. In the same way, hot steel and wooden strips will also emit smoke.

Because chlorine has the above cunning temperament, it is limited to the needs of laboratories and the application of technicians.

Now that pure fluorine is the latest product, large amounts of fluorides are also being put to work. Fluor spar is the main fluorine mineral. It is a beautiful crystalline mineral, often subtly displaying an elegant color, but it is not known that it hides the evil fluorine inside. The most fluor spar is produced in the United States in places such as Illinois, Now Monico, Kontrclky, etc. If six to eight pounds of fluor spar are added to a ton of steel, it is easier to dissolve the steel in the open hearth process, saving fuel, and the steel produced is of a superior quality.

In the manufacture of enamels, a large amount of fluor spar is also needed every year, because fluor spar can lower the melting point of the elements in the enamel and increase the brilliance of the finished product. When fluor spar is added to glass, it becomes milky white and is used to make light bulbs, lampshades, and so on.

Also, when fluor spar reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid, a gas with a strange odor is produced. If absorbed by water, it becomes concentrated hydrofluoric acid. In the past, this liquid was specifically used for etching glassware and as a reagent for industrial analysis. In the past few years, after it gradually disappeared, hydrofluoric acid also became peculiar. At that time, after intense research, a complex mixture called Freons was produced. Among them, the most successful gas is commonly called Fr2, which is a perfect refrigerant. The development of this economical refrigerant has surpassed indoor refrigerators.

Other commercial fluorine minerals include cryolite, which contains a mixture of aluminum (sodium aluminum fluoride). It is also an electrolyte for the manufacture of aluminum. Greenland is the place with the most cryolite production. Because of its importance, special escorts were often used during the war to transport it from Greenland to the United States.

Lastly, we want to see the future of fluorine. Scientists studying materials science say it is bright. For example, it is predicted that a fluorine mixture can be used to make smooth oil that can withstand the most rugged modern machinery for a long time (which is now impossible without a lubricant that can withstand terrible pressure and friction). Like an occasional event, today's hydrochloric acid can be refined into high-grade gasoline in oil refineries. Oxides added to water can prevent tooth decay.

Fluorine will be modified into a gas that is an absolute insulator under amazingly high voltage and applied to neck-generation X-rays and other electronic work. Fluorine also has a new chemical tool: metal fluoroborates. Among them, sodium fluoroborate can be applied to trees to prevent insect attacks and used as a cleaning agent to remove rust from iron or clean the surfaces of stones and earth, exterminating bedbugs and mice. Potassium fluoroborate is used as a flux for welding metals.

Other fluorine-related products include heat conductors, excellent insecticides, super anesthetics, herbicide objects, insulating rubber, fire-resistant substances, plastics, fumigants, etc.

Scientific Dictionary

### BCG—Tuberculosis Prevention Vaccine

— Bao Zhongqi

BCG is the abbreviation of Bacillus Guerin in English. The direct translation should be the tuberculosis prevention vaccine discovered by Calmette and Guerin. This name commemorates the two French scientists Calmette (GuA Calmette) and Guerin (CGuerin) forty years ago.

Calmette and Guerin initially thought that pulmonary tuberculosis was rampant among cattle. If a part of the germs could be taken from sick cattle and gradually weakened, so that its toxicity was reduced, to the point that it would not cause tuberculosis after being injected into the human body, then this germ might stimulate the human body to produce a strong immune body, like the effects of preventing diphtheria and smallpox.

This ideal was correct. After a long period of work, they put a highly virulent germ separated from cattle into a potato culture dish containing 5% glycerin and bovine bile. After four years of such work, they had achieved preliminary success. The cultured bacteria no longer caused tuberculosis in animals. Then, after thirteen years of research, the BCG vaccine was officially created.

After successfully testing the reaction of BCG on chimpanzees, Calmette, disregarding criticism from all sides, gave a small amount of BCG to infants who had just been born and lived with a grandmother suffering from tuberculosis. The infants grew up healthy, at least proving its partial effectiveness.

After continuous experimentation by scientists, among more than two million infants who have used the BCG vaccine, we know that although it cannot absolutely prevent tuberculosis, the vast majority of people have been able to avoid tuberculosis. Even if they unfortunately still contract tuberculosis, the situation is relatively mild and easier to treat. Unfortunately, it can only prevent tuberculosis and cannot be used for treatment. It cannot be used for people who have already had tuberculosis. In fact, adults are rarely not infected, so the target of application is often infants.

Now, the Shanghai Pasteur Institute (institut Pasteur) is studying BCG under the guidance of Dr. Liu Yongchun, which is good news for my country's medical community!

### Sketches of the British National Physical Laboratory

— Chen Feng

The British National Physical Laboratory, founded forty-six years ago, is a world-renowned scientific research institute. It belongs to the Science and Industrial Research Department and is located in Teddington, a suburb of London, covering an area of more than sixty acres. Leading this laboratory is the world's leading theoretical physicist Sir Dr. Charles Darwin; he is the eldest grandson of the great biologist Charles Darwin.

This famous laboratory is the link between scientific knowledge and daily life, the medium between theory and experiment, and the bridge between science and industry and commerce.

This institute is divided into ten departments: the Physics Department, the Engineering Department, the Electrical Department, the Wireless Electricity Department, the Measurement Department, the Metallurgy Department, the Optics Department, the Aeronautics Department, the Naval Architecture Department, and the Mathematics Department. The scope is so wide that it can be said to be all-encompassing.

The premise of the development of modern industry is the progress of weights and measures. Determining the standards of these countless units of measurement is definitely not something that private enterprises can accomplish. This is one of the important tasks of the laboratory. The Measurement Department preserves the standard units of length, mass, and time, as well as their derived units, such as volume, density, and pressure, etc. The measurement of length can be accurate to one millionth of an inch. The Electrical Department has a small group specializing in how to preserve the standards of current, voltage, and resistance, etc. in the CGS system. At the same time, there are also standards for units in wireless electricity, such as the comparison of frequencies, which can distinguish differences of one ten millionth. The Acoustics Group of the Physics Department studies how to measure noise, and there is also a Radiology Group responsible for the British Radium Standard. Before 1939, one-fourth of the world's radium was tested here.

In addition to the preservation of standards, the determination of the characteristics of various industrial raw materials is also an important task. For example, the Engineering Department studies the "fatigue" of materials and the "creep" of metals. The latter is the phenomenon of overflow that occurs when metals are subjected to various forces at high temperatures. This laboratory is a pioneer in this kind of research. There is also the Metallurgy Department, which studies the physical properties of metals and alloys, such as strength, composition, and structure, etc.

Most of the departments here are broad and general, but there are also two specialized departments—the Naval Architecture Department and the Wireless Electricity Department. The Naval Architecture Department studies how to improve ship design and the improvement of propulsion, and also makes models to test the properties of ships. Before the war, 80% of merchant ships were first tested with models here before being built. It is estimated that this can save one million tons of fuel every year. The Mulberry Harbour used during the Great Occupation in France was also planned and decided here. As for the work of the Wireless Electricity Department, it is to study the propagation, attenuation, direction finding, and the properties of air and the ionsphere of wireless electricity. The success of radar used in the war was mostly due to the research work of this department.

The British National Physical Laboratory is still growing continuously. On the one hand, the work of each department is gradually developing and expanding. On the other hand, new departments are added when needed. The Mathematics Department is a newly added one. Its tasks can be divided into three points: one is calculation work. If there is an engineering problem, the equations are already available, but large-scale calculations are needed before the curve can be determined and applied, then it can be entrusted to this department to do it; the second is statistical work; and the third is the improvement and design of computers.

This institute is a very large organization, and a detailed description cannot be achieved in a short article. Departments such as the Aeronautics Department and the Optics Department also have important work, which this article has not introduced. In short, it is still one of the largest research institutes in the world. The world recognizes its value and its authority, and it can develop scientific talents in all aspects. The industrial community will consult it more and obtain valuable guidance.

### Prospects for Bacterial Warfare

— Qu Youding

The term bacterial warfare may already be familiar to people. This is a tactic whose horror is comparable to that of atomic warfare. In bacterial warfare, of course, the main thing is to use the invasion and spread of bacteria to kill the enemy, but the bacteria used are quite limited due to various reasons; now let's talk about several kinds of bacteria that are suitable for bacterial warfare.

The cholera bacteria, tetanus bacteria, typhoid bacteria, and smallpox, etc. that humans fear the most are first listed as unsuitable for bacterial warfare, mainly because they can be prevented by injection of preventive needles. Some are excluded because they are not infectious, easy to diagnose and treat, or cannot be spread by artificial methods. Only twenty-one kinds of pathogenic bacteria are expected to be used in war.

In the past, under the topic of biological warfare, there was mention of a canned food poison bacteria called Botulism, which is extremely toxic to the human stomach. If 350 pounds of this substance are dripped into 10 million gallons of reservoir, drinking one drop of this water will kill people—according to Dr. Roseburg and Kabat, this thing may be used in war. However, after many frequent experiments on white mice, it was discovered that white mice can drink one percent of the amount of water that would kill a person and still not die. Over time, it is even predicted that drinkers can use the simplest method of boiling and disinfecting to drink it without harm. In fact, the bacteria that can be used in war are almost all some strange and little-known bacteria. According to reports, parrot fever, which was once rampant in Africa in 1930, is one type. Others include a disease called Meliodosis, the "Far East Disease." According to reliable medical records, only ninety-five people had suffered from this disease until 1933. These toxins or bacilli can only be obtained from biological laboratories and will be beneficial for military purposes, because the more bizarre the symptoms, the more difficult the treatment, and this kind of infectious disease can harm the enemy.

More familiar and usable for general combat are Anthrax, flu bacteria, meningitis, and pneumonic plague, etc. Pneumonic plague has the name of a "super" weapon. A single pneumonic plague bacillus is enough to kill a squad rat. As for humans, they should also be unable to escape. This bacterium can spread in dense smoke and fog, not only in open spaces, but can even enter through closed windows and doors.

As for the method of throwing bacteria, it still needs to be studied. There is a method that is completely feasible and beneficial for military use, that is, using aircraft to throw tightly closed bacterial boxes. Once they land, they can automatically unfold and hug out large groups of insects (such as mosquitoes and flies) carrying millions of bacteria, using their entire thorn to transmit the disease. If a certain bacillus can resist explosions, using debris, missiles, grenades, etc., can also carry bacteria and complete its infectious mission. Usually, it not only poisons humans, but also poisons the meat, milk, food, and industrial products supplied by animals. These are of course also the general goals of bacterial warfare.

### Small Inventions

— Nan

Electronic Wall-Penetrating Peep Sight The American General Electric Co. recently invented a microwave device that can peep through walls with unusual clarity. This peep sight looks like a spotlight, controlled by 110 volts of alternating current. It includes many electron tubes, oscillating circuits, transformers, antennas, and reflectors, all contained in a box weighing only four pounds. The wall-penetrating peep sight emits a concentrated high-frequency radio wave, so it can penetrate obstacles such as brick walls and reflect back from rough or dark surfaces. A metal tube then carries the reflected light back to the clock. At the same time, the antenna in the parabolic reflector senses these reflected lights, and after passing through a silica detector, the results are indicated on an instrument. The electronic wall-penetrating peep sight has great industrial uses, such as counting, orientation, switching, erasing, signaling, quotas, and projection, etc.

New Method for Preserving Frozen Meat Frozen fish and frozen meat can be dipped in molten plastic wax, which can save many unreliable packaging methods. This is the latest method for preserving cold food in the United States. The wax paste does not stick to the surface of the food, but can adhere to it tightly, making it more firm and safe than the best oil paper at low temperatures. It does not fall off when dropped casually, and frozen meat can be used for more than a year. When you eat it, cut open the food and scrape it with a knife, and the wax will come off completely. Therefore, fruits and vegetables can also be preserved using this method.
