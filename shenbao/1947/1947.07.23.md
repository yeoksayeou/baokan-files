Mr. Wedemeyer, tall and spirited, wearing a sky-blue white linen suit, a silk blue and white floral tie, black leather shoes, and carrying a white wide-brimmed straw hat, first appeared at the plane door, nodded in greeting to the grand welcoming crowd, smiled as he stepped down the ramp, and shook hands with Ambassador Stuart, Director Ling Qihan, Government Commissioner Song Ziwen, Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang (Chairman Chiang's representative), Chief Secretary Gan Naiguang (President Zhang Qun's representative), Minister Bai Chongxi, Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, Chairman Weng Wenhao, Mayor Shen Yi, and others, exchanging pleasantries.

Mr. Wedemeyer stayed in the room next to the Ambassador's on the upper floor of the residence, while his entourage stayed in the prepared rooms inside the U.S. Embassy. According to his news consultant, Mr. Watson, who spoke to reporters, they flew from Guam at 6:30 AM and had a very safe and pleasant journey. The itinerary in Beijing is yet to be determined, but they will obtain various relevant data as soon as possible for preliminary research. They will use Nanjing as the base of operations for this trip, and then go north to conduct fact-finding investigations. If conditions permit, northern Korea under Soviet control will also be a subject of investigation. Watson confirmed that Mr. Wedemeyer did not carry any private letters, and the delegation's mission must be completed within six weeks.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: U.S. President's Special Representative General Wedemeyer is scheduled to visit Chairman Chiang at the National Government at 11:00 AM on the 23rd, visit President Zhang Qun at the Executive Yuan at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, visit Minister Wang Shijie at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:30 PM, and attend a dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife in the evening.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] General Wedemeyer intends to reduce social engagements as much as possible during his visit to Beijing, as he believes that such engagements may take up his work time, and his stay in China is very short and should not be wasted. President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan mentioned this matter in the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 22nd, saying that it was Mr. Wedemeyer's opinion. As far as is currently known, in addition to the dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife, the U.S. Embassy will hold a grand reception, and the government will jointly host a banquet once by various leaders.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] The city of Beijing has been sweltering recently, with the room temperature consistently reaching 100 degrees. According to old people, this is unprecedented in seventy years. After General Wedemeyer got off the plane, he and Chief Secretary Wu Dingchang, Chairman Chiang's representative, shook hands and took a photo, jokingly saying, "It's so hot!", which amused the government officials and reporters who braved the heat to welcome him.

### Special Envoy Wedemeyer Issues Statement

[U.S. Information Service, Nanjing, 22nd] General Wedemeyer arrived in Beijing on the 22nd to begin a six-week on-site investigation of the situation in China and Korea. He recently issued the following statement to reporters:

"I previously served in China for quite some time as Chief of Staff to Chairman Chiang and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in China. It has been more than a year since I left China. I am very pleased to return to this old place and meet with all of you old friends again. I have always hoped to relive the warmth of this friendship. Unfortunately, my stay in China this time is very short. My time and energy must be constantly devoted to the extremely important work of both China and the United States, so I anticipate that there will not be much time for us to meet, which is regrettable.

Regarding the work to be done in the next six weeks, I will only give a general overview. I have been ordered by the President of the United States to come and investigate the general situation in China and Korea, that is, the current situation in the two countries and their ability to recover in the future. The basic nature of my mission is to investigate the facts, assisted by a small team of experts. These experts have rich experience in economics, finance, engineering, and politics. What we are most concerned about is to learn about the measures taken by the Chinese government to achieve recovery and how effective they are.

The time limit for completing our mission is very short. The personnel in my mission must devote all their time to searching for and evaluating various reports. This kind of report is not only crucial to China, Korea, and the United States, but also obviously important to the whole world. I am determined that our work will have real and timely value. If so, then we must take on this responsibility with an open mind.

Good results are most likely to be obtained through sound and prudent planning. This kind of planning is not only based on what we hope to be true, but also on what we know to be true through objective and thorough observation.

This statement explains why I am currently unable to make any statement of expectations or intentions, but one thing I can tell you is that I will do my best to fulfill the instructions given to me by President Truman to determine all the facts about the political, economic, and military situation, whether favorable or unfavorable, link these facts to each other, and then evaluate them, and at the end of my mission, present the results of this work to the President of the United States."

### Full Text of Economic Reform Plan

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] The economic reform plan passed by the National Economic Council on the 21st has been sent to the Executive Yuan and submitted to the National Government. It is scheduled to be submitted to the State Council meeting for discussion on the 25th, and will be announced and implemented after it is passed by the State Council. After being researched and revised by various experts, the plan has become more detailed than the original plan. The full text of the plan passed by the Economic Council is as follows:

Foreword

Our country is founded on strictness, has a vast territory and abundant resources, and abundant labor. However, the current economic crisis is becoming increasingly serious, and it is urgent to first explore the root cause of the problem as the basis for reform. According to economic activities, production is the major premise. There are three factors of production: land, capital, and labor. What the countryside lacks is only capital, and general financial institutions are still unable to accept land as collateral, and there are no specialized land financial institutions. Currently, the agricultural loans of various banks are also very small and do not help the situation. The advantages of our country's vast territory, abundant resources, and abundant labor have not been fully realized. This is actually due to the lack of sufficient financial support. How should future policies start from utilizing the abilities of the majority of the people? How can the financial system itself be sound and substantial? How can its funds be properly coordinated with land and labor to achieve rural prosperity, increase farmers' purchasing power, and lay the foundation for the development of domestic livelihood industries? As for the business of various banks, there should be a clear division of labor, each with its own specialty, each with its own mission, and mutually contributing to the development of the economy. This is what financial reform should urgently seek. Secondly, how to make an agricultural country move towards industrialization is the most important issue for national construction in the future. The development of various production and construction undertakings in our country should have a comprehensive plan, even if the strength of the people and the government is combined, and they cooperate according to the plan, it is still insufficient. In fact, the division between state-owned and private industries is not clear, resulting in insufficient strength on the one hand and hesitation on the other hand. The government has not fully fulfilled its function of supporting various private enterprises. As for fixed assets such as factory buildings, factory land, and machinery, both state-owned and private enterprises have not obtained sufficient convenience to use them as collateral for re-production. It is difficult to expect various financial industries to develop in a planned manner. How to use national capital as a leader in the future, to guide the activity of private capital, to allow state-owned enterprises to take on the difficult tasks, and to assist private enterprises to take on the easy tasks, so that the government and the people can work together, and to welcome foreign capital and technical talents with preferential methods, to achieve the goal of industrialization. This is what production and construction reform should urgently seek. Again, finance should start from developing various production industries, so that the proportion of income can be expected to increase. If the government budget cannot be balanced for a day, the currency will inevitably increase. In addition, the fact that the total funds are truly used for production also causes currency inflation, resulting in shrinking production, lack of materials, skyrocketing prices, and soaring interest rates, thus the source of taxation is exhausted, and the gap between income and expenditure becomes increasingly disparate. In the past, we did not seek solutions from effective methods of increasing and supervising production, but only focused on temporary remedial measures, which were all counterproductive. How can we carefully measure the currency system itself in the future, how can we increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and how can we improve the collection policy, so that the financial foundation can be strengthened with the development of various production undertakings, and the production capacity of hundreds of millions of people and their total income can support the finances of the entire country? This is what financial reform should urgently seek. The following is a brief description of the main points of the above three reform strategies:

(A) Regarding Finance

The reform of the financial system must pay special attention to serving the country's economic policy, to achieve the main goal of making the land fully utilized (agriculture), making the materials fully used (industry), and making the goods smoothly circulated (commerce). Financial institutions should each have their own specialized business for increasing production, so that the phenomenon of ordinary commercialization can be eliminated. Public and private banks must be planned and distributed throughout the country, so that they can become a systematic financial network, and not be concentrated in coastal cities, especially in the corner of Shanghai, creating a skewed phenomenon. The following are the reform methods for financial organization and business:

(1) The county bank is the foundation of the financial system. It should be thoroughly rebuilt and supported for its development. Its main business is to develop the rural economy, facilitate local construction, and cooperate with the implementation of local autonomy. It should be established in each county in principle. Its funds are invested by the county government with the public funds of the county, township, and towns, and private shares can also be raised. At the same time, the Central Bank and the Provincial Bank should also invest appropriately as a leading share, and should provide specialized talents and provide business guidance and supervision.

Depending on the type and needs of its business, the county bank should be assisted by the China Farmers Bank, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China.

(2) The Provincial Bank's main business is to regulate the province's finances, support economic construction, and develop the province's production undertakings.

The Provincial Bank is located in the provincial capital. Its branch locations are limited to important political and economic centers in the province.

(3) Land finance should be designated by the government with special funds, and land bonds should be issued. A specialized bank should be established at an appropriate time to manage it.

(4) The China Farmers Bank's professional scope is to support rural prosperity, and it operates agricultural production, farmland water conservancy, agricultural product transportation and sales, and land finance loans to facilitate farmers.

(5) The Bank of Communications' professional scope is to assist in the development of industries, and it operates loans for industry, mining, transportation, and public utilities.

(6) The Bank of China's professional scope is to assist in the development of domestic and foreign trade, and it operates loans related to domestic and foreign trade and production undertakings, advances, and international remittances.

(7) The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau's professional scope is to absorb people's savings deposits and handle small remittances.

(8) The Central Cooperative Treasury's professional scope is to support the organization and development of various cooperatives with cooperative loans.

(9) The Central Trust Bureau specializes in trust reinsurance and insurance for public enterprises, and is responsible for guiding the trust insurance business of private enterprises.

(10) The Central Bank is the bank of banks, and its main responsibility is to regulate the country's finances, so that finance and the economy are closely linked to assist economic construction.

(11) After the restoration is completed, the Four Joint Offices will be changed into a design and contact institution, or merged with the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, and changed into the Financial Administration Bureau, which is under the Ministry of Finance, to unify power.

(12) The classification and distribution of private banks shall be stipulated by the government, and the amount of their capital shall be increased. Small banks and money shops shall be merged and organized to strengthen their capital. The use of their funds shall be stipulated by the government with standards and strictly managed.

(13) Each national bank shall be responsible for contacting and guiding the business of ordinary banks with the same nature within its professional scope, and the scope and location of its branch offices shall also be stipulated separately according to its business object.

### Ministry of Finance Strengthens Financial Control

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Since the General Mobilization Order was promulgated, the Ministry of Finance has formulated the following measures to strengthen financial control:

1. Control the financial market: (1) Designate areas and strictly manage remittances according to the situation in the financial market in various places. (2) The Central Bank shall supervise the banking industry in various places to carefully review and reasonably control interest rates in accordance with the regulations on loan interest rates for bank management, and supervise their implementation. (3) Supervise the legal circulation of negotiable instruments and impose strict sanctions on the use of illegal negotiable instruments and bad checks.

2. Strengthen the management of banks and money shops: (1) Resolutely implement the measures to strengthen the control of financial business and the Ministry of Finance's bank management methods.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Huludao Port is currently the only port for our external transportation in the Northeast. However, the port's original single pier has been in disrepair for years, and the waterway has been silted up, making it necessary to repair it in a timely manner to avoid total collapse. The construction period for the port is from July to October, and it is inconvenient to work after that period. The total engineering cost required is over 400 billion. However, for the sake of the national treasury's expenditures, the Ministry has prepared an estimate for emergency repairs, which can build three piers and requires 42.662 billion National currency. After the completion of this project, ships of 10,000 tons or more can safely enter the port and dock, which will greatly benefit transportation in the Northeast. The Executive Yuan has decided to approve an additional 40 billion yuan, including the previously allocated 2 billion yuan, which will be deducted. The Executive Yuan has also approved an additional 80 billion yuan for the Tanggu New Port project, to be allocated in installments. The following items are planned to be completed by the end of the year: (1) The waterway is clear, and 3,000-ton ships can pass through the locks to Tianjin, and 5,000-ton ships can dock at Tanggu, avoiding the need to wait for tides offshore for lightering. (2) 5 to 7 ships of 3,000 to 5,000 tons can dock in front of the first pier. (3) Complete the railway and warehouses to facilitate coal exports and material storage and transportation. (4) Prepare icebreakers to maintain winter navigation. In terms of its location, the port is quickly connected to Pingjin. In terms of military and economic relations, it is extremely important.

In addition, in order to strengthen air transportation in the Northwest and achieve the goal of regularly maintaining two monthly flights from Shanghai to Hami and Shanghai to Dihua, the government has decided to subsidize fuel and transportation costs totaling 2.5 billion yuan from May to December of this year.

### Full Text of Economic Reform Plan

Continued from the First Page

(B) Regarding Production and Construction Workers

At present, various production enterprises areËêéÁº©(wƒìisu≈ç, withered, shrank), and the nation's human and material resources have not been fully utilized. The government's future policy should be: (1) to provide as much protection as possible for existing production and construction enterprises, in order to stabilize employment and prevent unemployment. (2) To gradually increase new production and construction enterprises through effective planning, and guide idle manpower to participate in production. (3) Encourage scientific inventions and advocate labor service, in order to transform the scholar style and encourage the spirit of creative enterprise. (4) To coordinate planned education with planned economy, so that talent cultivation is integrated with production and construction. Increased agricultural and industrial production, supplemented by convenient transportation, will stimulate creation, welcome foreign investment, and gradually stabilize prices. The following are the measures for developing electricity, agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation, increasing production, and stabilizing prices:

1. Agriculture: Farmers account for the absolute majority of the population, and agriculture is the backbone of the Chinese economy. When agriculture is developed, the countryside is prosperous, and farmers have their purchasing power, then industry will have a basis and society can be stable. Therefore, developing agriculture and prospering the countryside are the main objectives of the implementation of future economic policies. The methods are:

(1) Reform the distribution relationship of agricultural land to fully improve it. For the use of tenancy relationships, the principle of "25% rent reduction" should be thoroughly promoted, and ways should be sought to implement "land to the tiller" as much as possible so that farmers can engage in production.

(2) Encourage reclamation and select sites to pilot collective farms and cooperative farms. Using new machines and methods, increase production to demonstrate to farmers. Expand agricultural experiment and research sites to improve production technology.

(3) For agricultural reform, water conservancy is important. Large-scale water conservancy projects and the construction of trunk canals should be actively carried out by the state. The construction of small-scale water conservancy projects and branch canals should be supervised by the central government to be carried out by provinces and counties. Permission can be requested to issue water conservancy bonds, and the completed projects will be the responsibility of the local area for maintenance.

(4) Expand and improve rural cooperative organizations, and truly facilitate agricultural loan procedures, in order to reduce the burden on farmers.

(5) The ever-normal granary system urgently needs to be established. The initial plan for building warehouses and storing grain must be completed as soon as possible in the key locations of the Yangtze River basin. Local grain accumulation should also be strengthened and universally implemented to increase reserves.

(6) The Farmers Bank of China should actively promote its agricultural warehouse mortgage and agricultural product transportation and sales business, with the goal of using financial power to assist the government in supporting production, controlling grain sources, and regulating surpluses and deficits.

(7) Establish nurseries widely, promote afforestation, and use effective methods to maintain their growth. Natural forests and conservation forests should be owned and operated by the state, while other barren mountains and wastelands suitable for forestry should be supervised for private operation, and attention should be paid to the operation and encouragement of fuel wood forests.

(8) Take advantage of agricultural leisure to train farmers in techniques such as civil engineering and stonework, and develop rural sideline businesses to improve farmers' lives.

(9) For animal husbandry, attention should be paid to preventing and controlling animal diseases, improving livestock quality, increasing livestock breeding frequency, and promoting increased livestock production. In all agricultural areas, forage crops should be increased, and wasteland should be used to expand livestock breeding. In all natural pastoral areas, livestock breeding should still be the focus, and grassland management should be strengthened, grasslands cultivated, and improved forage planted to stabilize and increase livestock production and improve the livelihoods of herdsmen.

(10) Develop marine and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture, encourage farmers to raise fish, and promote aquaculture processing industries. (To be continued)

### Mystery of Flying Saucers Revealed: One Crashed Near Chengdu; Experts Study as Weather Instrument

[Our Chengdu Dispatch of the 22nd] Recently, a "flying saucer" was also discovered in Chengdu. On the 18th, several silver-gray, circular luminous objects flew over Chengdu from the southeast high altitude, sparkling like meteors. One of them crashed in Zhongxingchang, Huayang County, about twenty miles from the city. It was picked up by local villagers and sent to Sichuan University for research. A reporter visited on the 21st and saw that the object was a metallic silver rectangular box, about twelve inches long, five inches wide, and one inch thick. Its bottom was hitting a white cardboard box, with four small batteries and a wireless transmitter with two vacuum tubes inside. On the box was a transparent plastic cover over a barometer, and on the side was a funnel. Its structure was very exquisite and had English markings, indicating that it was made in the United States. According to research by aircraft engineering experts, it is indeed a type of military high-altitude weather instrument. It is released from an aircraft and uses radio waves to report air pressure and weather conditions to various weather stations. Therefore, many are scattered in the high altitude. It is feared that the "flying saucers" recently reported to be found in various places are all similar objects.

### Editorial: After Wedemeyer's Arrival in China

General Wedemeyer arrived in Nanjing yesterday afternoon at 5 pm from Guam. The fact-finding mission composed of American political and economic experts also arrived in our nation's capital at the same time. Starting today, they will begin their work of investigating the actual political and economic situation in China. We, standing from the perspective of the Chinese people, regardless of whether the task undertaken by this "Friend of China," General Wedemeyer, is significant, and regardless of whether the mission he undertakes will be successful, cannot help but express our heartfelt welcome. Now, as General Wedemeyer is about to begin his work, we wish to state the common aspirations of our Chinese people.

First, we must first point out to General Wedemeyer that the current situation in China, whether politically or economically, is in a state of turmoil. However, this chaotic situation can only be regarded as a microcosm of post-war world politics and cannot be seen as a source of turmoil in Asia or the world. Only by understanding this characteristic of the Chinese political situation can we prescribe the right medicine and give China's chronic illness hope of recovery. Otherwise, relying solely on General Wedemeyer's personal feelings for China to prompt the United States to provide some material assistance to China will not only be of no help to China, but also the ultimate goal of President Truman's appointment of General Wedemeyer to come to the East will not be fully realized!

Second, we want to further explain that the evolution of the Chinese situation to this point is by no means the sole responsibility of the Chinese people or the government. We may as well recall the situation in the Far East since Japan's unconditional surrender. Although Japan temporarily withdrew from the Far Eastern political stage due to its defeat in the war, on the other hand, the importance of the Soviet Union on the Far Eastern political stage increased. Our country's diplomatic authorities were keenly aware of the changes in the Far Eastern situation after the war, so they attached particular importance to diplomacy with the Soviet Union, even at a significant cost, to obtain the friendship of the Soviet Union. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance is an excellent testimony to this. However, the results we obtained after paying a considerable price were: (1) the removal of industrial equipment from Northeast China; (2) the obstruction of our country's takeover of Lushun and Dalian; (3) the invasion of our country's Xinjiang Province by Outer Mongolian troops; (4) the participation of Korean communists and Japanese prisoners of war in the communist army rebellion in the Northeast. In this situation, how can China achieve peaceful unity politically? How can it achieve stability and prosperity economically?!

Third, without us explaining it, General Wedemeyer will know that the losses suffered by China during this war were greater than those of any European country. After the war, China was deeply wounded and wanted to revive and prosper, so it naturally needed external assistance. Since the issue of Japanese reparations cannot be resolved for the time being, the Chinese people's hopes are naturally placed on our allies. However, several months ago, Secretary of State Marshall spared billions of dollars to aid the recovery of European countries, but for China, he kept the 500 million in loans that had already been allocated but not yet released. This American approach, which still does not escape European centrism, will inevitably arouse suspicion among the Chinese people about American policy. Fortunately, General Wedemeyer has now been ordered to come to China, and these unnecessary misunderstandings can be swept away. We are very willing to frankly tell General Wedemeyer that China and the United States were allies fighting shoulder to shoulder during the war and had endured hardships together. Now that the war is over, China still hopes for the assistance of the United States so that the two countries can move towards a common ideal. Therefore, China does not forget old friendships and sincerely hopes for American assistance, which is by no means out of selfish motives. We believe that General Wedemeyer will certainly understand this point.

In short, General Wedemeyer is our "Friend of China" who not only understands the political situation in China, but also understands the feelings and aspirations of the Chinese people. Now, after a gap of one year and three months, he has come to China again. He arrived in Nanjing yesterday and revisiting the old place must make him feel particularly cordial. We do not want to say much, but we hope that General Wedemeyer will observe the facts more, have more contact with our country's officials and civilians, thereby understand China and recognize the Far East, complete his mission within six weeks, and report his findings to President Truman one by one as a basis for the United States to change its policy towards China!

### A Call for Basic Education

The United Nations Far East Regional Basic Education Conference will soon be held in our country. In order to synthesize opinions from all parties, the Ministry of Education convened a preparatory meeting on the 10th of this month, specially inviting more than 60 experts to attend. The meeting lasted for three days and concluded on the 12th. The conference was presided over by Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education and passed many important proposals on basic education and prepared to hold an exhibition. But what is the state of basic education for our own people? On the eve of this grand event, we should first conduct an honest review.

Currently, there are approximately 67 million school-age children nationwide between the ages of six and twelve. (75% of them are in rural areas, 15% in cities, and 10% in border areas.) Only 27 million are enrolled, accounting for just over one-third of all school-age children. The remaining 60% or so of school-age children have not enjoyed basic education. Only in Taiwan Province, 95% of the 878,580 school-age children are enrolled. The national illiteracy rate is as high as 72%. This is how we see the basic education of our people from the perspective of "quantity."

The health condition of school-age children is even more frightening. According to the report of Mr. Zhang Tianlin of the Ministry of Education on his inspection of national education in Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, and other places, only 10% of school-age children are considered healthy, 90% are unhealthy, 50% are malnourished, and 80% have trachoma. These are truly alarming figures and are the most serious problem in our country. Qualifications of elementary school teachers: Graduates of normal schools account for 36.39%, graduates of other schools account for 47.58%, and those without school education account for 16.3%. According to statistics of the qualifications of 30,000 elementary school teachers in 14 provinces and cities reported in May 1946, most of them were graduates of junior high schools. They have not received sound teacher training. As for the rudimentary school facilities, the lack of teaching materials and equipment, and the adherence to outdated teaching methods, they are all obvious facts. Therefore, it is estimated that students' level has dropped by two years compared to before the war.

The adult education department of national schools, originally intended to provide remedial education for the illiterate, is even more nominal. From the perspective of most rural villages across the country, this has almost become a legal term and a term used by teachers in the classroom. According to reports from various places, the Ministry of Education said that in 1945, 7 million adults and 3 million women nationwide were receiving remedial education. Even if these figures are accurate, compared to the proportion of illiterates in our country, the achievements of adult education are not worth mentioning. This is how we see the basic education situation in our country from the perspective of "quality."

As for the funding for primary education in various counties, in the past, local educational fund committees and other organizations had a somewhat independent nature. Since the implementation of the new county system in 1941, county finances have been centrally collected and disbursed, and the funding for national education has fallen from about 30-40% to 5%. The county budget for 1947 only listed central national schools, and the general funding for national education was left to the townships and Baos to raise themselves. As a result, the so-called "one school per Bao" plan in most rural areas was reduced to a dilapidated temple with a school sign hanging in front of it. This is the funding situation for basic education.

China's educational administration has always been characterized by the central government running higher education, the provinces running secondary education, and the counties running primary education. Therefore, the Ministry of Education will strive for university funding from the Executive Yuan, and professors are the leaders of culture, and students have the ability to stage strikes, petitions, and parades. The provincial education departments often concentrate their efforts on running secondary education, so the funding for universities and secondary schools, despite their difficulties, is still better than that for national education. The funding provided by the central and provincial governments to national education is extremely meager. The source of funding for basic education is the central government blaming the provinces, the provinces blaming the counties, and the counties pushing it to the townships and Baojia. It is pitiful that most townships and Baojia across the country have problems even with the office expenses for paper and ink, let alone running education! Therefore, when instructions are issued from higher levels, documents are submitted and returned, and plans and statistics fill the paper, all of which become empty talk. The people's right to basic education is deprived, elementary school students do not have the ability to cause school strikes, and most parents lack knowledge and have to let them fend for themselves. In some places, elementary school teachers earn only two Dou of rice per month, no wonder teachers have become a temporary haven for the unemployed. Where can we even begin to talk about the people's basic education!

Since the nineteenth century, education has been recognized as a right of the people. Whether it is our country's past constitution or provisional law, they all clearly stipulate that basic education is a right of the people and is free education. But in fact, most people have not enjoyed this right they should enjoy. Even in the areas of Beijing and Shanghai, which are known as the political, economic, and cultural centers of the country, it is extremely difficult for students to enroll, and in some places, free education often involves collecting fees.

In short, our country's basic education, whether in terms of "quality" or "quantity," is already close to bankruptcy. This is a huge hidden worry for the country. Without healthy future generations of citizens, how can the country talk about construction! As the Far East Regional Basic Education Conference is about to open, we must review the actual situation of our own basic education. We must present the rights of the people of democratic countries to basic education. We hope that people from all walks of life will regard national education as the center of gravity for national construction and strive forward.

### Indonesia Sends Note to United Nations Requesting Mediation of Dutch-Indonesian War; Sjahrir Ordered to Lobby Various Countries

[Our Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 22nd: The United Nations Headquarters received a memorandum from the Republic of Indonesia today, requesting the United Nations to take appropriate action to intervene in the war between the Netherlands and Indonesia. At the same time, the headquarters also received a formal memorandum from the Dutch government, stating the reasons for the Dutch "security" actions in Indonesia.

[Associated Press, New York, 22nd] Arab nations are scheduled to discuss on the 22nd the possibility of submitting the recent Dutch-Indonesian dispute to the Security Council with representatives of the Indonesian League here. As for whether the Soviet Union will take any action, there are no signs yet, and British and American representatives have expressed indifference to the issue of Indonesia being handed over to the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] Well-informed sources here recently stated that a country in the Far East may bring the Indonesian issue to the United Nations Security Council, possibly China or India.

[Reuters, Singapore, 22nd] Former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir arrived here today from Yogyakarta. Sjahrir said that he was ordered by President Sukarno to discuss with world political leaders the best way to stop the Indonesian war. He will depart for India tomorrow and will also go to London and Washington to ask British and American leaders to use their influence to stop this shameful colonial war.

[Reuters, London, 21st] People here believe that Foreign Secretary Bevin may have discussed the issue of British and American mediation of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute when he met with US Ambassador Douglas today, but it is expected that at the current stage when the Dutch army has just begun its offensive, the Dutch government will not accept the suggestion of mediation by a third party. A statement from the British Foreign Office has already revealed that the British government's suggestion earlier this month to appoint a neutral police commissioner to resolve the issue of a joint police force between the Netherlands and Indonesia has been rejected by the Dutch government. Indonesia is very willing for any third party to engage in mediation and intervention.

Fighting Rages in Sumatra

[Our Report] A broadcast from San Francisco on the 22nd: The Republic of Indonesia issued a communique stating that the coastal artillery unit on the west coast of Java opened fire and hit two Dutch warships found off the coast. Indonesian troops are currently in contact with the Dutch Marines in eastern Java. Several Indonesian positions in Sumatra have been shelled by the Dutch, and the fighting is in full swing. Confirmed news reports that the Dutch army has occupied Sukabumi, south of Bogor and west of Bandung.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] The Dutch Air Force bombed the Republic of Indonesia's airport in Java on the 22nd, destroying ten aircraft. The Dutch goal on the first day has been achieved. The resistance of the Republican Army is weaker than expected. Some of the Dutch casualties were caused by landmines and ambushes.

[Reuters, Batavia, 22nd] The Dutch army landed on the east coast of Java today and engaged with the Indonesian army. The Dutch army carried two tanks and five trucks and advanced twenty miles after landing. Before landing, the Dutch Navy shelled the coast for several hours to "soften" the coastal defenses. This area is the most prosperous region in Java, producing sugar, tea, coffee, and rubber. The Indonesian army on the Sambong front is still holding on and has made slight progress. Dutch aircraft also fired rocket artillery at the port of Cheribon.

### Dutch Army Uses American Aircraft in Combat; US Officials Express Extreme Dissatisfaction, Believing Dutch Have Made a Big Mistake

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] US officials are extremely regretful about the use of a large number of American aircraft by the Netherlands in the Dutch-Indonesian war. A senior official stated that the Netherlands has not received any US military supplies since the end of the war. During the Pacific War, the United States leased 40 fighter jets to the Netherlands for the purpose of fighting Japan side by side, but there were no bombers. If the Netherlands has obtained American bombers, it must have obtained them from other countries and not from the United States. According to other opinions, it is believed that the Netherlands actually possesses some materials from the US Lend-Lease Act in Indonesia, which should be attributed to the United Kingdom. When the United Kingdom withdrew from Indonesia at the end of November 1945, despite being informed by the United States not to transfer any military supplies to the Netherlands, the United Kingdom actually transferred the Lend-Lease materials to the Netherlands.

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Regarding the Netherlands launching a full-scale war against Indonesia, it is reported that officials here believe that the Netherlands has made a big mistake. Reliable senior officials believe that the result of the war will be the same as the Vietnam War, trapped in a stalemate, only able to occupy urban areas, while the countryside will be in the hands of guerrillas.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The State Department officially announced today after communicating with the ambassadors to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands that the United States government deeply regrets the recent outbreak of the Indonesian war, but is still prepared to negotiate economic assistance to Indonesia when an agreement is reached on the issue of a provisional government.

### Gillean Arrives in India

During the meeting, someone asked the head of the American delegation, Brown, whether it was true that the Soviet representative intended to exercise his veto power to prevent some Korean public groups from expressing their opinions on the establishment of a temporary unified government in Korea. SitiKoff replied, "There is no issue of veto power." When asked whether the interpretation of the 1945 Moscow Agreement on the organization of a unified Korean government seemed to have reached an impasse, and whether it could be resolved by a United Nations agency, SitiKoff replied, "There is no impasse that cannot be broken." SitiKoff also read a lengthy written statement, accusing the attitude of American representatives of violating the Moscow resolution and the recent discussions between Marshall and Molotov. SitiKoff said that the American representatives intended to solicit opinions from industrial and commercial groups, academic institutions, and other non-social groups, even fictitious groups. The Soviet Union advocated first consulting with groups that were not opposed by both the United States and the Soviet Union and that had more than 10,000 members each, but this had been rejected by the United States.

### U.S. State Department Advisor Cohen Resigns; Vacancy to be Filled by Bohlen

### U.S. Pays Attention to Situation in Burma; Hopes for Peaceful Resolution of Political Issues

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd Dispatch]  The State Department spokesperson recently told our reporter that the United States is closely monitoring the situation in Burma following the political assassinations. Aung San was also among those killed. Washington officials have long viewed him as the future Prime Minister of Burma. However, the Burmese issue is of particular concern to the United Kingdom. Therefore, the U.S. government does not intend to make it a problem in U.S. foreign policy. However, the peace and order of Burma are also of particular concern to the American people. The U.S. government hopes that Burma can find a peaceful way to resolve its political problems so that it can achieve autonomy.

[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] Prime Minister Attlee told the House of Commons that after the Burmese massacre, he requested India's permission to use Indian troops in Burma if necessary.  So far, there has been no such necessity. The authorities have taken every step to provide reinforcements as needed. Burma is not yet a dominion government, so the United Kingdom still has the responsibility to maintain law and order in Burma.

### Arrested Suspects Increase to 300

[Reuters, Rangoon, 21st Dispatch] Rangoon police continue to search for the murderers of the cabinet massacre, stating that they are "confident that they will capture all the murderers." To date, more than 300 suspects have been arrested. Seventeen leaders of the All Burma Trade Union today presented a blood letter to the executive committee of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, expressing their willingness to sacrifice their lives to eradicate the murderers and traitors who assassinated the great leader Aung San. When former Prime Minister U Saw, who was arrested, was escorted to the Rangoon Central Prison under tight police guard, the crowd along the way shouted "Kill him!" incessantly. Police also refused to confirm or deny reports of the arrest of another former Prime Minister, Ba Maw, who was a puppet Prime Minister under Japanese rule. After the war, he did not engage in politics, but after Aung San signed an agreement with the United Kingdom in one day, he led those who opposed Aung San, organized the "Independence First League," and condemned the constitutional assembly election in April. Police searched his residence yesterday and arrested his son-in-law, Ba Yan Nan.

### U.S. Accepts Soviet Proposal on Distribution of Atomic Energy Materials

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 21st Dispatch]  At a meeting of the working subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today, U.S. representative Osborn declared that, in order to resolve the thorny issue of atomic energy and bring their opinions closer, the United States is willing in principle to accept the Soviet proposal to establish an international agency to distribute atomic energy, in order to establish an international treaty stipulating the regulation of the amount of raw materials and the quantity of nuclear fuel in each country.  Thus, the Soviet proposal for international distribution has been supported by the majority. The working subcommittee then discussed whether the international agency to be established in the future should own atomic fuel processing plants for industrial or military use, or whether it should only regulate them.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 21st Dispatch]  The activities of the United Nations agencies today are as follows: The Security Council Membership Review Committee stated that the applications of Albania and eight other countries to join the organization were difficult to approve at this time. The Economic and Social Council approved Hungary's application to join the cultural organization by a vote of ten to one, with the United States abstaining. The Cuban representative proposed that Hungary be classified as a non-democratic country, treated the same as Spain, but the proposal was opposed by the Soviet Union and was not passed.

### U.S. Still Plans to Invite Britain to Discuss Increasing German Coal Production; British and French Opinions Not Consistent with U.S.

[United Press, Washington, 21st Dispatch]  Senior U.S. officials stated that the United States is currently pursuing a plan to convene a meeting in Washington to increase coal production in the Ruhr region. It is said that Marshall is unlikely to issue an invitation unless he believes that Britain will accept the situation. News from London can confirm this statement. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas emphasized the importance of this meeting when he visited Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 21st and still hopes for Britain's participation.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st Dispatch] Regarding the U.S. intention to increase German industrial production to a level far higher than that newly stipulated by the Potsdam Agreement, informed sources recently stated that Britain and France are very anxious about this. The French government recently submitted a note to the British government expressing concern about this U.S. intention. It is said that Foreign Secretary Bevin also informed U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas of Britain's anxious mood. French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Massigli reiterated France's views on the issue of German industrial levels when he met with Foreign Secretary Bevin recently.

French Prime Minister Emphasizes U.S. Attitude Towards Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st Dispatch] Regarding the statement made by Prime Minister Ramadier that he would do his best to obtain economic cooperation from the Soviet Union, semi-official sources here expressed agreement, but also hoped that France would formulate its future policy and not rely solely on the expectation that the Soviet Union would participate in the European recovery effort. Prime Minister Ramadier's statement that "the door is still open to the Soviet Union" to probe whether the Soviet Union is willing to participate is actually a warning to the United States on the German issue. This can be seen from the recent statements made by French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet. That is, if the United States and the United Kingdom take steps to raise German industrial levels without French consent, France's attitude towards the Marshall Plan will be greatly affected.

French Ambassador to the U.S. Meets with Marshall

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st Dispatch] French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet met with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall today and talked for 45 minutes. Afterwards, he told the press that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France may reach an agreement on various German issues related to the Paris Economic Conference, and the future is promising.

### Jewish Terrorist Groups Clash with Police; Holy City Scene Resembles Battlefield

Terrorists continue to operate throughout the territory, and a major riot seems imminent. It is reported that the unprecedented move to send Jewish refugees back to France has caused friction between the Palestinian authorities and the British Foreign Office.

It also stated that the Jews will continue to work hard to immigrate to Palestine. Last night, the scene in Jerusalem resembled a battlefield.

### Greece to Hold Group Defense Conference; Head of U.S. Military Delegation Also to Participate; Civil War Resumes on Crete

### Harriman's Speech Explains U.S. Policy Towards Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman, who recently returned home after a two-week inspection in Europe, held a press conference here and stated that the issue of giving Germany priority in industry does not exist. This is only a matter of restoring Germany's normal European living standards in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The purpose of the current negotiations on German industrial production levels is to stabilize the import and export trade of the British and American occupation zones in Germany. The U.S. State Department, like the Department of Commerce, is also prepared to do everything possible to help achieve a balance in the import and export trade of the British and American occupation zones. At present, Germany's industrial production is only 38% of its pre-war level, while industrial production in France and Belgium has reached 90% of its pre-war level. The main problems facing Germany are coal and food. The current population of the British and American occupation zones is eight million more than before the war. Since the plan to import food from Eastern Europe has failed, most of the people in the British and American occupation zones rely on imports to maintain their lives. As for the coal problem, Germany's coal production has decreased significantly. On the contrary, although coal production in France and Belgium is not higher than in 1939, it is at least equal to that in 1939. The United States hopes to increase the supply of food and materials to Germany in order to increase German production. In short, the coal in the Ruhr region does not only represent German property, but also the property of the entire Europe.

(Question) What are your views on the widespread rumors about a new conservative party, referring to the new conservative party of Yoshida and Shidehara? (Answer) I don't think a new conservative party can be established immediately. What preparations are being made for the peace conference? (Answer) It is necessary to frankly reveal the true situation in Japan and seek the understanding of all countries. (Question) What is your determination regarding the food problem?

### Only a Few Thousand of the 20,000 Anti-Japanese Righteous Army Remain; Mo Dehui Speaks of Past and Present with Tears; The Jiangbei Returned Home Righteous Army Comfort Conference Was Held Yesterday; The Mayor Praised Them as True National Heroes

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Comfort Conference for the Northeast Returned Home Righteous Army was held yesterday afternoon at 5 pm in the gymnasium of Jiaotong University. 1,216 members of the Righteous Army attended, as well as Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, Mo Dehui, Kong Xiangxi, Gu Yuxiu, Wu Yun, Chu, Commissioner Song, representative of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Li Guiyong, representative of the Executive Yuan, and representatives from the Northeast Compatriot Association in Shanghai, Fudan University, and the Northeast Alumni Association of Jiaotong University. At the beginning of the conference, Mayor Wu and others inspected the entire Righteous Army. Then Chairman Mo Dehui gave a speech. (See photo, taken by this newspaper) Mo briefly stated: Seventeen years ago, the Japanese army invaded our Northeast, and the Northeast heroes organized the Righteous Army, rose up to resist, and laid the foundation for our country's victory in the Anti-Japanese War. The Righteous Army then fought in the Northwest and was also able to quell the rebellion and stabilize the interior. At that time, there were more than 20,000 people, who endured hardships. So far, there are only thousands of people left, which is very emotional. At this point, Mo choked up and shed tears. He continued: Today, the Righteous Army has received preferential treatment from the government, and they have been sent back to their hometowns. Along the way, various places have taken special care of them, which is very grateful. In addition to paying tribute to Chairman Chiang on behalf of the Righteous Army, I would like to thank all places and all sectors three times.

Mayor Wu, in his capacity as the host, expressed his welcome to the Righteous Army and said that he had many feelings upon seeing the disabled, old and weak. He and the brave men of the Righteous Army have served the country for a long time and are true national heroes. Chairman Fang delivered a speech, saying that although the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the Northeast is still in the midst of continuous warfare. He encouraged the brave men to continue to strive for the permanent stability of the Northeast by using the anti-Japanese spirit of Changbai Mountains and Heilongjiang after returning to their hometowns. Kong Xiangxi encouraged the Righteous Army to give play to the anti-Japanese forces of the past after returning to their hometowns, and to protect the prosperous and beautiful Northeast. Wu Yun Chu, on behalf of the business community, expressed his comfort and admiration. Gu Yuxiu explained the process of borrowing dormitories from Jiaotong University and Fudan University, saying that the teachers and students of the two schools expressed their welcome. Director Li of the Executive Yuan expressed that if there were any shortcomings in the food and accommodation and transportation of the Righteous Army, please forgive them.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Health Bureau, in view of the lack of medical care for workers in the city, has organized the Shanghai Factory Hygiene Committee to actively carry out work with the Social Bureau Workers' Welfare Committee and the General Labor Union.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Xu Xueyu's Alleged Weariness is Unfounded

[Report from our newspaper] It was rumored that the Police Department of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would be reorganized and that General Manager Xu Xueyu was also rumored to be weary of his duties. A reporter specifically visited General Manager Xu to inquire about this matter. Xu stated that the aforementioned news was purely unfounded rumors. Police Chief Shi Renzheng has an excellent performance record, and there is absolutely no need for a change. He also stated that the current policies of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are to support private shipping and to develop overseas routes. Recently, the company commissioned the Jiangnan Shipyard to build two merchant ships suitable for the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) routes. The ships are to be delivered in ten months, and the cost per ship is 10 billion yuan, which is much cheaper than purchasing from foreign countries, and it also saves foreign exchange and encourages the domestic shipbuilding industry. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will continue to place orders after these two ships are delivered.

### Dismissals Should Comply with Factory Law: Social Bureau Has Not Received Orders

[Report from our newspaper] Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the Social Bureau has not yet received the order from the Ministry of Social Affairs, which was rumored that the Shanghai Industrial Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have received the Ministry of Social Affairs' interpretation that the dismissal of workers in each factory should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law. Before receiving the order, all dismissal cases will still be handled in accordance with the regulations set by the Municipal Labor-Management Arbitration Committee.

The administrative power of the factory has been expanded compared to before, and the case will be submitted to the Arbitration General Assembly to be held on the 26th for discussion.

### Railway Bureau Land Occupied: Squatter Shanties Ordered to be Demolished

[Report from our newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has a piece of land in Zhabei, Shanghai, on Mo Ling Road (formerly Jin Ling Road). Previously, it was occupied by squatters who built more than 200 shanties. The Railway Bureau determined that the location is adjacent to the Shangbei Engine Room and has been selected as the site for the construction of dormitories for train operation employees. All construction plans have been designed and completed long ago, but construction cannot begin because the land has been occupied by these squatters. Previously, a two-month deadline for demolition was set, and personnel were sent to persuade them, but to no avail. It is now learned that the bureau will soon begin construction and has set another 15-day deadline for demolition and has sent letters to the Municipal Council and relevant agencies for assistance.

[Report from our newspaper] At the end of the lunar year last year, Chen Wenzhi and Zhang Liansheng, due to the need for funds at the end of the year, sold a car to Municipal Senator Zhang Yiqu, for a price of 12 million yuan.

### Major Gunfight Between Police and Robbers in the 16th Ward: Two Robbers Killed, Two Captured

[Report from our newspaper] At around 8:20 pm last night, at No. 55 to 57 Limalu Road in the Nanshi 16th Ward, which is the Shuang Kaijian Qianxinghe Tobacco Shop, the shop doors were already closed when suddenly four robbers appeared. One was on the lookout outside the door, and three robbers entered in succession. One was wearing blue khaki trousers and a striped poplin shirt, carrying a travel bag. One was wearing a striped poplin shirt and trousers, and another was wearing a long gown. They pretended to be shopping and pulled out firearms. At this time, the accountant of the shop was opening the account, and all the legal currency of more than two million yuan was placed on the account table. The robbers were about to commit robbery when, fortunately, neighbors discovered the situation and urgently reported it to Police Officer Tong Qiyuan at Post No. 6384 at the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Dongmen Road, and Police Officers Yin Fengchao and Zhou Kangnian at Posts No. 6303 and 6268 at the intersection of Limalu Road and Dongmen Road. Tong first rushed to the scene and kicked open the door. At that moment, one robber was about to rush out of the door and said, "Sir, don't get the wrong idea, we are here to buy goods." The police officer did not allow him to go out, and another robber standing inside suddenly opened fire with a gun. Tong dodged to the side and was lucky not to be hit. He also returned fire with one bullet, hitting the robber in the forehead. The robber fell to the ground and died. At this time, one of the robbers wearing a striped poplin shirt and trousers took advantage of the flying bullets to escape upstairs. Tong, seeing that one robber had been killed, bravely chased after the robber. As a result, the robber fled into a small room on the second floor and committed suicide with a handgun out of fear of punishment. There were five bullets left in the barrel, and ten more bullets were found next to him. At the same time, a robber at the door was running to Yang Songji's ground cargo shop on the same road, and the two police officers at Posts No. 6303 and 6268 rushed to intercept him after receiving the report, and finally captured the robber. At this time, Chen Jingshan, Deputy Chief of the Yimiao Police Sub-Bureau, also rushed to the scene in a car after hearing the report, leading Section Chief Zhou Nan, Inspector Xie Wanfu, Police Chief Cui Jinchuan, and police officers Qian Wumin and Li Jiafu, along with the righteous . The robber on lookout outside the door (named Ye Haichou, 24 years old, from Wenzhou) fled to the Bund ferry near the 16th Ward after the failure of the robbery and was intercepted by police officers from the Water Police Bureau and transferred to the Yimiao Police Bureau for investigation. Section Chief Zhou and others seized three handguns and dozens of bullets from the home of the victim. The bodies of the two robbers were later sent to the police hospital by car and then to the autopsy center for examination. In this operation, all four robbers were either killed or captured. It can be said that the net of heaven is vast, and no one can escape it.

### Land Rights of the Catholic Church: Registration Issue Temporarily Suspended: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is Collecting Data for Research

[Report from our newspaper] The Catholic Church has purchased a lot of real estate in this city. Fan Erdian, the person in charge of the church, previously held documents to the Land Administration Bureau for registration. The Land Administration Bureau stated that the nature of the Catholic Church is different from other British and American churches. The Catholic Church is a world organization under the jurisdiction of the Roman Curia. Various countries recognize it as a member of the international community and exchange ambassadors with our country, but there is no treaty to obtain land rights, and it cannot be regarded as a Chinese church. Therefore, the Land Administration Bureau cannot grant land ownership registration and has asked the Executive Yuan how to deal with it. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan had an instruction to Shanghai, stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is collecting information and consulting with various agencies to study and handle the issue of drafting management measures for the Catholic Church. Before these measures are drafted and approved, the registration of land rights of the Shanghai Catholic Church should be temporarily suspended.

### Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, Admiral Kirk, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: Scheduled to Fly to Beijing This Morning to Meet Wedemeyer

### High-Altitude Luminous Body: Not a Balloon: Still a Mystery

[Report from our newspaper] The story of flying saucers being discovered in this city remains a mystery. Recently, Mr. Fan Jiakang, a radio operator at the Jiangwan Radio Station, sent a letter to this newspaper proving that the luminous object he witnessed on the evening of the 19th was a weather balloon launched by the US military meteorological station. However, on the late night of the 18th, foreigners also discovered an object resembling a flying saucer. After investigation, it was found that the US military meteorological station did not launch any balloons on that day. Then, what is this luminous body? It is difficult to explain. A reporter spoke with Zheng Zizheng, Director of the Central Meteorological Observatory, yesterday, and Zheng believed that there were three possibilities: one is a weather balloon, which the US military meteorological station often launches; the second is a meteor, which can often be seen on summer nights; and the third is a secret weapon under testing. However, the possibility of the former two is greater. In addition to these, there may be some people who like to join in the fun and deliberately fabricate the story of witnessing flying saucers.

### China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Shanghai Passenger Plane: Parts Damaged, Left in Qingdao: Special Plane Sent to Pick Up Passengers to Shanghai

[Report from our newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's XTT-81 Shanghai-Shanghai flight, which flew from Shanghai to Shanghai the day before yesterday, discovered that a certain part inside the plane was damaged and had to be replaced when it passed through Qingdao. The plane was left in Qingdao and grounded, and all passengers were taken care of by the company and spent the night in Qingdao. Yesterday, the company sent a special plane from Shanghai to transport the parts and pick up the passengers to Shanghai. According to a company spokesperson, due to the current foreign exchange situation, material supplies are difficult, and various parts cannot be fully purchased, nor can they be uniformly equipped at all stations along the line. When this situation occurs, another plane must be sent to replace it, resulting in a great financial loss and great inconvenience to passengers. This shows that the development of our national civil aviation industry is quite difficult under the current material difficulties.

### New Wheat Has Entered the Market: Loan Still Not Approved: Emergency Meeting of the Flour Industry: Representatives Elected to Make a Final Appeal

[Report from our newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association applied to the Ministry of Food and the Four-Organization General Office for a loan of 300 billion yuan of raw wheat two months ago to enrich the raw materials for flour production, increase public food, and alleviate the food panic. Although this application has been reported many times that it has been submitted for discussion and approved, the association has not yet received any clear orders from the competent authorities. Now that the new wheat has entered the market, if the competent authorities still transmit the documents through ordinary official channels, even if approval is granted, it will repeat the mistakes of last year's 30 billion yuan raw wheat loan, missing the opportunity and not benefiting anything. The association held an emergency meeting yesterday and elected Yang Guanbei, Xi Debing, Rong Yiren, Qian Zhonghan, Hong Qichen, Ren Zhuoqun, Wang Zhongjia, and Luo Zhongfeng as representatives to make a final appeal to the Four-Organization General Office today, to decide as soon as possible whether to lend, so as to cooperate with the government's general mobilization national policy and strengthen public food production. Otherwise, the new wheat will flow to other areas due to the shortage of funds in factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, which will lead to panic among the public, making it impossible to continue rationing, and once panic is formed, it will be difficult to remedy afterwards.

### "Watermelon, Watermelon!" This Year, Abundant Rain Has Significantly Impacted the Quality of Watermelons: Total Sales in Shanghai May Reach 50 Billion Yuan

Tangqi Watermelons Were Once Renowned; Pinghu Watermelons Have Followed

[Report from our newspaper] In addition to artificial beverages such as ice cream and soda, we must not forget watermelons as a wonderful product for cooling off in the summer. This year, there has been more rain, which has greatly affected the quality and quantity of watermelons. However, the weather is so hot, its consumption is still increasing day by day. Not many days ago, Tangqi watermelons were only 50,000 yuan per load, but yesterday they rose to 140,000 yuan, and demand still exceeds supply. There are about 100 or more watermelon wholesalers in the two fruit markets north and south of the 16th Ward and the Laozha Bridge. It is estimated that the average sales figure for each company this year is about 500 million yuan, totaling about 50 billion yuan. If calculated at 140,000 yuan per load, the consumption of watermelons in this city is 350,000 loads. With an average of 12 watermelons per load, there are a total of 4.2 million watermelons. With a population of over 4.2 million in this city, then each person can eat an average of one watermelon in a summer.

The watermelon rush still has one week to go, at which time 300,000 to 400,000 watermelons can arrive every day. Although the harvest is not abundant this year, the planting area has doubled compared to last year, so the total output has not decreased.

Everyone knows how to choose the quality of watermelons by tapping them with their fingers a couple of times, but more important is the skin color, especially the darkness of the yellow color of the bottom skin, which clearly tells you the age of the watermelon. Of course, the older and more mature ones are the sweetest. An old watermelon industry veteran told reporters that the planting land for watermelons should not be too old. The first year of planting watermelons on land that has never been planted with watermelons will produce the best watermelons. More than 40 years ago, the Sanbai melons of Tangqi Xiaolin were once famous, and later the San Tang and Daijiabang watermelons of Pinghu successively became dominant, especially the Daijiabang watermelons, which were crisp and sweet and could be broken with a finger. At present, the Sanbai watermelon from the south gate of Pinghu is considered the best, with yellow and loose flesh. Some have already arrived in the past few days. Unfortunately, there are not many. The quality of the South Gate watermelons has gradually deteriorated in recent years, and the watermelon throne is about to shift. I wonder who will succeed them.

### Taiwan-Shanghai Flight Detours to Fuzhou to Pick Up the Fujian Provincial Chairman to Shanghai

[Report from our newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hong Kong flights were originally scheduled to stop in Fuzhou twice a week. Recently, due to the newly promulgated inspection measures at Fuzhou Airport, the implementation method is still under discussion, so the company has canceled the stop in Fuzhou for two flights. Yesterday, Fujian Provincial Chairman Zhao Jianxu had to fly to Shanghai and then to Beijing on official business and had no plane to take, so he urgently telegraphed China National Aviation Corporation to send an additional flight from Fuzhou to Shanghai. Because the company's flights no longer stop in Fuzhou, in order to ensure that Liu could make the trip on schedule, it ordered the Taiwan-Shanghai flight to detour to Fuzhou today to pick up Liu to Shanghai.

### "Manila" Just Left, "Tokyo" Arrives Again

[Report from our newspaper] The American Northwest Airlines "Manila" passenger plane, which flew to Manila from Shanghai the day before yesterday, returned to Shanghai from Manila at 7:00 am yesterday and took off from Longhua Airport at 12:15 pm to return to the United States. This is the first flight on the North Pacific route from Shanghai to the United States. Passengers on board were all foreigners, including eight people such as the manager of Citibank, Thomas. It is also learned that the "Shanghai" plane returned to Minneapolis from Anchorage. Yesterday morning, the company's second passenger plane, the "Tokyo," passed through Shanghai. The plane will return to Shanghai from Manila this morning, arriving at 7:00 am and taking off at 9:00 am to return to the United States.

### Single-Person Operated Three-Wheeler Rickshaws: Magnetic License Plates Ready for Collection

The magnetic license plates for the single-person rear-seat three-wheeled rickshaws converted from operating rickshaws in this city, after No. 15,000, were not manufactured in time, and the Public Works Bureau first issued driving licenses and stamped them with "Provisional Notice that Magnetic License Plates Have Not Been Issued" to allow operation. It is now learned that the magnetic license plates have now been manufactured and can be collected from the original vehicle registration office where the licenses were obtained, with the driving license and the original seal of the owner, from today onwards. Car has also not been delivered, Chen Wenzhi and Zhang Liansheng falsely stated that it would take time to transfer the car ownership and that it must be donated around the tenth day of the lunar new year this year, and the car must be delivered at the same time. They also asked Senator Zhang to handle the prepayment of the payment flexibly, which Zhang refused. Later, Chen Wenzhi pleaded with Zhang, saying that he urgently needed funds at the end of the year and would issue a bill of 6 million yuan, and his friend Song Liangrui came forward to intercede, and Zhang agreed to issue the bill. Unexpectedly, time passed quickly, and the two repeatedly delayed on the pretext that the car was not delivered until March of this year, and the car ownership had still not been transferred and donated. Huai Yanming had to donate the car license within a week. When the time came, he again used excuses to delay. It was not until last month that Senator Zhang discovered that the old car license on the car belonged to another car and was an impersonation. Even if the transfer could be completed, it would be illegal. He then negotiated with Chen and Zhang, but Chen and Zhang have since avoided meeting him. Senator Zhang knew that he had been defrauded and that riding an unlicensed car was illegal, and he had no choice but to send the original car and the car license used to impersonate another car to the Laozha Police Bureau for investigation. Just when the Laozha Police Bureau was conducting an impartial investigation, Chen Wenzhi and Zhang Liansheng suddenly filed a lawsuit against Senator Zhang with the District Procuratorate, accusing him of dereliction of duty and demanding compensation of 30 million yuan. The investigation court opened yesterday, and Senator Zhang denied in court that he had demanded 30 million yuan. The prosecutor Yu then announced "release with a reprimand." The "defendant released on bail" reported in a certain evening newspaper was not true.

### Yongheng Securities Firm: Suspected of Being Inspected

Yesterday, the Economic Division of the Police Bureau received a secret report from Mayor Wu, stating that Maocheng Yin Hao and Yongxing Jin Hao at No. 505 Sichuan Middle Road were suspected of operating a black market for gold and banknotes. The Police Bureau, together with other agency personnel, went to the address for inspection at 11:00 am yesterday. It was discovered that the place is now the Yongheng Securities Firm. No evidence of operating a black market for gold and banknotes was found. Only 55 old telephones and 40 bolts of Shilin cloth were seized. Seven employees of the firm, Cheng Shuchu, Yi Yongquan, Shao Xinfu, Qiu Zhilong, Fan Zhongru, and workers A Er and A Fu, were taken to the bureau for questioning on suspicion and were allowed to be released on bail.

### Black Market Gold Raid Leaked: Only a Small Fish Was Found

[Report from our newspaper] According to reports, the Economic Division of the Police Bureau stated that a black market gold trading organization was established at No. 7 Ruyi Lane, opposite the Securities Building on Hankou Road. Yesterday, when personnel were sent to search, it was finally seen through by a woman on lookout at the entrance, who notified in advance by doorbell. When the police officers entered the house, in addition to seizing some incomplete transaction orders, they found nothing. Seeing four men looking flustered, they added inspections. As a result, a small gold bar of one tael was found in a man's sock. He was detained and taken to the bureau for interrogation.

Yesterday's report of the rejection of the appeal was a mistake in the appeal for the application to stop detention. The appeal in this case is under review in the Supreme Court.

### Barber Instigates Strike: District Procuratorate to Issue an Arrest Warrant

[Report from our newspaper] Yang Jinsi, a barber at the Red Peony Barber Shop at No. 1513 North Sichuan Road, posing as the head of the barber industry union, arbitrarily increased the price of haircuts at the shop by 40% on May 11, from 7,000 yuan to 9,800 yuan. Yang claimed that the 40% increase belonged to the union, but in fact, he pocketed it all himself. The owner of the shop, Yin Chaojun, accused Yang of improper behavior because the business was greatly affected. Yang not only refused to accept it, but also incited the barbers of the shop to strike and threatened to cut off Yin Chaojun's legs. Yin then reported to the police station. Yang fled after hearing the news. After summoning other barbers such as Sun Wenlong, they confessed that Yang had incited the strike. After investigation with the barber industry union, it was found that Yang was not the head of the union, but only had a relative in an important position in the union, which Yang used to swagger about. After the case was transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation, Yang Jinsi repeatedly failed to appear after being summoned. It is heard that the District Procuratorate will issue an arrest warrant.

### British Film Company Plans to Establish Its Own Cinema in Shanghai

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Film industries of various countries have recently launched fierce competition in the Far East region. To resist the dominance of Hollywood films in the Shanghai market, the British Odeon Corporation is planning to establish its own cinema in Shanghai, exclusively showing British-produced films.

According to an article written by Xun Tai'er recently published in the magazine "China of Tomorrow," British films that depict real British life can greatly increase the credibility of the British in China, promote cultural relations, and benefit both countries. Xun Tai'er also pointed out that British films, with their limited production, will focus on quality. It is even more necessary to prevent the export of inferior films to avoid adverse effects on Sino-British relations. In this way, there will be another competitor in the Chinese film market: British films.

### Preview Screening of "Fake Phoenixes and False Dragons" Held to Invite the Press for Observation: Barbers' Guild's Request for Prohibition Fails, Tension Once Rises in Front of the Theater

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The dispute between the Wenhua Film Company's film "Fake Phoenixes and False Dragons" and the barbers' guild is still pending after the Social Bureau invites various agencies to attend a preview screening and jointly review whether it should be revised or deleted. Wenhua Film Company is scheduled to host the press today at 4:00 PM to make a statement.

In order to understand the situation, the Shanghai Journalists Association specially obtained the consent of Wenhua Film Company and borrowed the film "Fake Phoenixes and False Dragons" for a screening at the Guanghua Grand Theater at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, inviting colleagues from various newspapers to attend. The barbers' guild learned of this and immediately sent representatives to the Social Bureau yesterday morning, requesting a prohibition of the screening. The Social Bureau stated that the film was borrowed by the Journalists Association from Wenhua Film Company for screening, and since it was done with the consent of both parties, the Social Bureau had no right to prohibit it. If they wanted to request a ban, they should submit a request to the Xincheng Police Sub-bureau, to which the Guanghua Grand Theater belongs. In the end, it yielded no results and they dispersed.

At 4:40 PM, more than a quarter of an hour before the film was scheduled to begin, more than 500 barbers' guild workers suddenly lined up on the sidewalks in front of the Guanghua Theater. The iron gates were tightly closed, and the crowd was dense, creating a tense situation.

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Industrial Association held its twelfth meeting of the first session of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday afternoon to discuss proposals to be presented at the National Industrial Association's general meeting in the capital on the 24th of this month. More than 30 executive and supervisory committee members attended, with Chairman Wu Yun Chu presiding. Several important proposals were resolved, preparing to be submitted to the general assembly for approval: (1) Request to increase the number of National Assembly and Legislative Yuan representatives from the industrial sector to double the original allocation (originally set at 10 Legislative Yuan representatives and 18 National Assembly representatives). The government stipulates that handicrafts and motorized industries should be divided equally, but the Industrial Association believes that there should be no division. All organizations and qualified associations should have the right to be elected, and the government should cancel the restrictions. (2) Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, before the Sino-Japanese peace treaty is signed and the compensation issue is resolved, the government should be requested to suspend negotiations. (3) Regarding the allocation of import quotas, the competent authorities should promptly make rigid regulations on the allocation ratio between the industrial and commercial sectors. (4) Some of the machinery in the Japanese compensation is damaged and unusable. The Industrial Association should request the government to refuse to accept this type of machinery. The compensated factories must be complete sets, otherwise, other production equipment can be exchanged. (5) Regarding the opinions on the Industrial Association Law, a research group should be specially organized, and Ye Fukan, Jin Runxiang, Xue Huichen, Hu Boxiang, and Yu Mingyu, among others, are publicly recommended as members, with Hu Boxiang as the convener.

Nation First, People First.

### Autumn Textbook Estimates

Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang Can Barely Cope: Remote Provinces Even More Deficient Than Before

According to the Ministry of Education's statistics and estimates, the number of national standard textbooks needed this autumn is approximately over 80 million copies nationwide. The direct costs such as paper and printing required amount to approximately 100 billion yuan. According to the usual practice in the publishing industry, due to various reasons such as warehouse storage, store storage, book storage among industry peers, and transportation difficulties, if the goal of one copy per person is to be achieved, at least twice as many books must be prepared. The printing costs required will be even greater and must be accumulated year by year in order to gradually expand from near to far and ensure a sufficient supply. Previously, 11 publishers including Commercial Press, Zhengzhong, Zhonghua, World, Datong, Kaiming, Wentong, Children's, Chinese Culture, Duli, and Shengli, due to their responsibility for supply, still have a large number of books in stock. However, with the recent increase in wholesale from foreign ports, there is already a trend of supply falling short of demand. As for other publishing and printing industries with a narrow scope, due to the lack of paper and shortage of funds, no company has yet published any books. According to estimates from those familiar with the publishing industry, the current number of national standard textbooks on the market is less than one-third of the actual demand. Areas near Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang may be able to barely cope, but the shortage of books will be even more serious the further away you go. For places such as Taiyuan and Jinan, they rely on airplane transportation, while for places such as Dihua and Qinghai, they require camel transportation. In the past, during the era of the Seventh Joint Office, due to the responsibility, it was necessary to plan and supply as a whole, which was barely possible. Now that the contract with the Ministry of Education has been terminated, fewer people will pay attention to these remote areas, and the book shortage situation will be even more dire.

They went to Beijing the night before last to present their case to the Ministry of Education and will return to Shanghai today.

### Special Points of the New Softball Rules

- Wu Bangwei

Since the Organizing Committee of the 7th National Games decided to include softball as a men's event and plans to adopt the American "Soft Ball" - Soft Balt rules, the Rules Committee of the All-China Sports Federation has also made the same decision and is currently translating the rules approved by the American Amateur Softball Association in 1947 as a blueprint. Because the Softball Committee of the Municipal Sports Association is about to organize this league, it will first announce the special points of the new rules for practice. Except for the following points, the new softball rules are generally the same as the baseball rules.

(1) The length of the base line in the field is 55 feet, the throwing distance is 43 feet for men and 35 feet for women, the hitting area is a rectangle of 7 feet by 3 feet, and the catching area is a rectangle of 10 feet long and 8 feet 5 inches wide.

(2) The circumference of the ball is 11 and 7/8 inches to 12 and 1/8 inches, the weight is from 6 ounces to 6 and 3/4 ounces, the seams must not protrude, the bat length is at most 34 inches, and the diameter at the thickest part is at most 2 and 1/8 inches.

(3) Players can wear gloves and rubber-studded sports shoes, the length of the studs is at most 3/4 inch, the catcher should wear a face mask, and women should also wear body protection.

(6) The pitching method is underhand. The ball must be released when the wrist crosses the body, and the hand must be lower than the waist when pitching, and the wrist should be closer to the body than the elbow.

(7) If the ball is hit out of the field, if it is a high ball and flies over the fence or into the stands, if the distance from home base is more than 200 feet, it is a home run, otherwise it is a double. If the ball rolls into the stands or through the fence, it is a double.

(8) When a batter has "three strikes": 1. If the ball is caught by the catcher, he is out. 2. If there are fewer than two outs and there is a runner on first base, he is out even if the ball is not caught by the catcher. 3. If there is no runner on first base, regardless of whether there are outs or not, the batter can become a runner if the ball is not caught. 4. If there are already two outs, regardless of whether there is a runner on first base or not, the batter can become a runner if the ball is not caught.

(9) If there are fewer than two outs, and there is a runner on first base, or first and second base, or first, second, and third base, and the batter hits or bunts a high ball in the infield, the batter should be out.

(10) If the batter is hit by the pitch on the body or uniform and does not swing at it, he can advance to first base.

(11) If the catcher misses the catch, causing the ball to touch fences etc. outside a distance of 25 feet from home plate, all runners may advance safely to first base.

(12) If a runner leaves the base before the pitcher releases the ball, he is out.

(13) From the time the ball is hit, when a runner advances, if there is a wild throw to first base, third base, or home base, and the ball touches an obstacle outside the field, or becomes an obstructing ball, the runner may advance one more base after reaching that base, and other runners may also advance the same number of bases. If the wild throw touches an obstacle or becomes an obstructing ball, each runner may advance as many bases as possible, but there is a danger of being stabbed.

(14) If a player, coach, or manager violates the rules, the referee shall immediately order him to leave the field, and he shall not enter the field for the rest of the game. Violators may also cause his team to forfeit the game.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs to Convene National Coal Production Increase Meeting on Schedule

Strengthening Autumn Coal Rationing in Coordination with the Mobilization Order

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to strengthen the national coal rationing in coordination with the general mobilization order, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has scheduled a national coal production increase meeting on August 1. The heads of major coal mining companies across the country are successively reporting. According to sources concerned: This production increase plan, in North China, such as Kailuan and the northeast coal areas, in addition to planning to increase production on the one hand, it should still start with protecting roads and mines on the other hand, so that the increased coal can be continuously supplied to various places in the country for consumption. At the same time, it is planned that the area south of the Yellow River should achieve the goal of maintaining self-sufficiency. In order to prevent the coal supply in North China from being interrupted in case of emergency, the coal consumption in the south is still abundant. The main focus of the production increase plan for each base in the south will be in Yiluo, East China, Huainan, Xiangtan, and Taiwan. The production increase of the Yiluo coal mine is currently being actively planned by the Resources Committee, and it is expected to produce 2,000 tons per day. The coal produced in the area can supply consumption in various areas west of the Longhai Railway. The current daily output of the East China coal mine is about 1,200 tons. It is hoped that actively developing new coalfields will enable the coal from the mine to continue to supply consumption along the Jinpu and Longhai Railways. The current daily output of the Huainan coal mine is about 2,300 tons. According to the planned production increase plan, the daily output can reach more than 3,000 tons by the end of this year, and 5,000 tons by the end of next year. If the production increase of the mine is successful, it can be expected to fully supply the Nanjing area and the Xichang industry. The focus of Xiang coal production increase is near Xiangtan, and it is currently being planned by the Resources Committee. If the coal production increase in the area is successful, it can be expected to fully supply the coal needed by Hunan and Hubei provinces. The production increase plan in Taiwan is currently under negotiation. Taiwan Province claims that it can increase production by 1 million tons per year, but technical issues still need to be further planned.

### Coal Arriving from Various Places One After Another

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Area Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has seen a gradual improvement in the situation of coal arriving from various places in recent months. In June, a total of 150,000 tons of coal arrived from various places. This month, it is estimated that 120,000 tons can be loaded from Qinhuangdao, 50,000 tons can arrive from Taiwan, and 60,000 to 70,000 tons can be purchased freely by coal merchants. In addition, the bituminous coal ordered by the China Trust Bureau from Canada can also arrive at 30,000 tons recently. After the coal arrives in abundance, the committee's emergency coal reserves are also expected to be gradually replenished.

### After Continuous Declines, Shorts Cover and the Trend Has Improved

Hua stocks rebounded yesterday. After continuous declines, shorts covered, but no new buyers participated in the middle. Xinyi suffered a sharp decline for many days. Yesterday, there was obvious maintenance, which was quite firm. Except for Xinhua's exclusive 10% decline, the rest of the small stocks, such as Xinguang and Jingfu, also tended to be popular in a short squeeze situation. The general trend has changed, or a small respite can be obtained. When the morning opened, the spot stocks were stable, and the deferred delivery stocks saw both rises and falls. After the deferred delivery of Maya opened at 477 yuan, No. 89, No. 23, No. 224, No. 19, No. 14, No. 133, No. 226, No. 60, No. 231, No. 110, No. 152, and No. 69 came in. Now Maya has risen to 498 yuan, and the deferred delivery of Maya has risen to 506 yuan. No. 157, No. 142, No. 76, No. 235, and No. 177 were sold, and after 9:30, they stepped down to 488 yuan. After that, No. 152, No. 154, No. 224, and No. 104 took advantage of the low price to absorb, while No. 157 and No. 223 sold, and started to spin, hovering until 10:20. No. 224, No. 19, No. 153, No. 78, and No. 61 saw eager buying, and the deferred delivery of Maya rose to 510 yuan. Now Maya reached 503 yuan. No. 32, No. 142, No. 85, and No. 223 entered the deferred delivery of Xinyi, and it also recovered to 3,170 yuan. No. 231, No. 73, No. 140, No. 94, No. 52, No. 69, No. 232, No. 104, and No. 132 sold one after another, and No. 223 even sold the spot Maya, forcing Maya to below 480 yuan near noon, and the deferred delivery of Xinyi was sold by No. 131 and No. 160 to the 3,000 yuan mark, Xinguang fell from 180 yuan to within 170 yuan, and Jingfu fell from 154 yuan to 146 yuan. Later, No. 180, No. 76, No. 112, No. 70, and No. 224 came in, and No. 223 suddenly came to cover, and the deferred delivery of Maya forced the 500 yuan mark near the close, and the deferred delivery of Xinyi was advanced by No. 169, No. 84, No. 207, and No. 45 to 3,120 yuan, and Xinguang Jingfu also ended at a high price. After the close, the deferred delivery of Maya was absorbed and raised to around 503 yuan by No. 237 and others. As a result, compared with the previous close, only Jingfu rose by nearly 10%, Xinguang, Maya, Xinyi, and Huafeng each rose by 5%, Xinhua fell sharply by nearly 10%, Zhongfa, Yonggong, and Qinxing rose but not much, and Guohuo was the same, Neiyi, Xinya, Cement, Jinglun, Datong, Shangping, Tongyi, Zhongsi, and Match each rose by 5%, mainly Zhongfang rose by 10%. For the deferred delivery stocks, Xinguang, Jingfu, Xinyi, and Huafeng each rose by more than 5%, and Maya and Yonggong only rose slightly. Among the old stocks outside the market, Huashang rose slightly, and the rest were weak.

Yongsha's off-site bid opened at 182 yuan to 185 yuan, a high price of 193 yuan to 196 yuan, a low price of 170 yuan to 181 yuan, and closed at a price of 190 yuan and 193 yuan. The interest rate is 1 jiao 6.5 fen to 2 jiao 1 fen.

### Unified Bonds Stable, Foreign Stocks Stagnant

The public price was very stable yesterday. The fluctuations of Tong Bing were very narrow. The opening price was 6,700 yuan, and it rose from 6,600 yuan to 6,900 yuan, and the closing price was 6,800 yuan. Room 360 and Room 503 sold, while Room 555 and Room 552 entered. As a result, compared with the previous close, A, B, C, and E each rose by 100 yuan, and Tong Ding rebounded by 200 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 1 million.

Foreign stocks were very stagnant yesterday, and it was extremely difficult to obtain a transaction, which was very idle. Yisha opened at 66,000 yuan and rose to around 66,500 yuan to close. The narrow fluctuations are rare in history. Although retail investors bought, Hesheng tested, and as a result, Ye Guang slightly fell and the rest rose slightly.

### Allied Victory Public Bonds Are Being Bought Secretly

At a time when US public bonds and US dollar short-term treasury bills are sluggish, some companies, firms, and individuals with financial resources in this city have been secretly purchasing Allied Victory US dollar public bonds issued in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War. The original schedule for the lottery redemption and interest payment of the Allied Victory US dollar public bonds was all in US dollars. After the victory, in order to control and conserve foreign exchange, the government explicitly ordered that it be changed to pay in legal tender according to the US dollar exchange rate. Recently, there have been rumors that in order to restore credit, the relevant authorities will pay in US dollars to foreign bondholders who are abroad, and will still pay in legal tender to Chinese citizens. Therefore, some speculators are secretly buying bonds on the market, taking them abroad, and entrusting foreigners to come forward to request the Chinese government to repay the principal and interest in US dollars. This new trick of evading capital and obtaining foreign exchange by trickery is very thoughtful.

### National Cotton Stock

1,142,000 Piculs

It is reported that the Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Joint Association of Machine Cotton Textile Industry Trade Associations, because the amount of national cotton stock is enough to affect the price of the cotton market, and the adjustment of cotton yarn raw materials has a close relationship. The association etc. carried out a national rural cotton survey in early March of this year. Because the flames of war are everywhere now, traffic often occurs in isolation, and estimation is difficult. Although the association etc. mobilized more than 400 people to work, the surface seems simple, but it is extremely complicated. Until June 20 of this year, it was estimated that some cotton areas in Shandong, Hebei, northern Jiangsu, and northern Henan were in special circumstances, and the numbers obtained were extremely incomplete. The numbers from Shanxi, Sichuan, and Liaoning provinces have not yet arrived, and all are missing. The reporter now records the numbers obtained by the association etc. as follows: Hebei Province stored cotton 2,119,000 piculs, Shandong Province stored cotton 143,000 piculs, Henan Province stored cotton 120,000 piculs, Shaanxi Province stored cotton 150,000 piculs, Hubei Province stored cotton 258,000 piculs, Hunan Province stored cotton 220,000 piculs, Jiangxi Province stored cotton 5,000 piculs, Anhui Province stored cotton 24,000 piculs, Jiangsu Province stored cotton 169 piculs, Zhejiang Province stored cotton 22,000 piculs, for a total of 1,142,000 piculs of stored cotton.

### Agent for Grinding Wheat Flour: More Than 50,000 Piculs of Wheat Have Been Received

Fuxin Fufeng and other companies in this city are acting as agents for the government to grind flour, and the China Agricultural Bank has allocated 130 billion yuan in funds. According to the person in charge of the Gongji Office, which is jointly formed by the five factories, after the office started working last week, it immediately purchased raw materials in Shanghai in preparation for mass production. As of yesterday, more than 50,000 piculs of wheat have been received. The first step in the office's plan is to first purchase wheat in Shanghai and Wuxi, and then expand to purchase in Nanjing, Wuhu, northern Jiangsu, Yangzhou, Taizhou, and other places. It is expected to receive 2 million piculs of wheat every day, so that 3 million bags of flour can be produced every month. Each factory has also started agent grinding production, but has not yet fully resumed work. Once the wheat is harvested from all over the country and sent to Shanghai, the factories can regularly maintain a sufficient amount of raw materials, and each factory can produce 114,000 per month, which will reach the pre-war production level.

### Sluggish Cigarette Market Conditions

Yesterday's cigarette market saw sluggish interest from all parties, with uneven absorption. On the market, ten-piece British cigarettes continued to be heavily traded, and prices remained firm, resulting in 8,760,000 yuan, a decrease of 90,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### China Trust Bureau Successfully Negotiates with MacArthur's Headquarters to Ship Sugar to Japan for Sale

The Total Amount for This Year is 25,000 Metric Tons

[Central News Agency, This City] In order to expand overseas trade, the Central Trust Bureau previously consulted with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, affiliated with the Resources Committee, to actively promote the export of sugar in order to earn foreign exchange. Considering that Japan consumes a considerable amount of sugar annually, which was previously supplied by Taiwan, the post-war demand for sugar is particularly high. Although the United States is famous for producing sugar, it has not been able to provide sufficient supply due to government restrictions. In view of this, the China Trust Bureau previously selected key personnel to go to Japan to negotiate with MacArthur's Headquarters. The negotiations have now been successful, and the Bureau has been approved to export a total of 25,000 metric tons of sugar to Japan this year. The deadline for delivery is the end of the year, and the selling price is US$0.15 per pound, with each metric ton valued at approximately US$300, totaling approximately US$15 million. The agreement stipulates that only "Zhongsha" (medium-grade sugar) is allowed. It is reported that the Bureau will formally sign a contract with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation within days. If there are no problems with the ships, the first batch of approximately 5,000 tons of sugar will be shipped to Japan by the end of this month. It is also reported that Taiwan Province has a bumper sugarcane harvest this year, and it is estimated that it can produce 300,000 tons of sugar this year and 400,000 tons next year. By the year 38 of the Republic, the area planted with sugar can be expanded to 118,000 jia (each jia is equal to 16 mu). The required fertilizer is 80,000 metric tons, which is currently being procured from domestic and foreign sources. Recently, 25,000 metric tons of sulfuric acid have been ordered from the Soviet Union, which will be shipped to Taiwan in batches for application soon. According to the recent decision made at the company's this year's sugarcane business discussion held in Taiwan, the previously agreed-upon sugar sharing ratio between sugarcane farmers and the company, with farmers receiving 48% and the company 50%, has now been changed to a uniform 50/50 split. Farmers are encouraged by this change and are more interested in sugarcane production.

### Taiwan Sugar Falls

Yesterday, the sugar market saw tighter credit among traders, leading many to sell, which caused Taiwan Sugar to fall by varying amounts of 30,000, 40,000, and 50,000 yuan. The association's marked prices were 6.45 million yuan for 24 coarse white sugar, 6.1 million yuan for secondary quality, 5.3 million yuan initially for 20 medium-grade white sugar, and later 5.15 million yuan, and 6.1 million yuan for half-vehicle white sugar. Transactions of local sugar remained low, and the trend was still flat. Shantou Qing was 445,000 yuan to 437,000 yuan, Xinghua white bagged superior goods were 5.8 to 5.9 million yuan, secondary white in baskets was 5 million yuan, Xingchi was 440,000 yuan to 420,000 yuan, and Diaoging oil-wrapped was 370,000 yuan, with a total of over 200 pieces offered.

### Foreign Firm Teas Steady and Popular

Yesterday, foreign firms in the city, Wuchang Tea Company continued to consult with goods suppliers regarding low-grade aged black tea, so the situation remained strong. Other green teas, such as Chouzhenzhenmei, needed by Africa and Morocco, were mainly held firmly by the goods suppliers, so the situation was still characterized by more asking than selling, and the transaction volume was only sporadic, while the market sentiment became more stable and popular. As for domestic sales of fancy teas, street shops and various routes to Beijing and Hangzhou still saw sales, and in this situation, the active state was mostly similar to the previous day.

### Yarn and Cotton Cloth Consistently Weak

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw continuing soft sentiment in the market, with mediocre demand from all parties and sluggish actual sales from out-of-town merchants. The market was sluggish and lacked vitality. The closing price for 42-count Lan Feng was 17.2 million yuan, a drop to the bottom price, continuing to fall by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Shibi Ma was 11.5 million yuan, and Qing Shuang Ma was 10.5 million yuan, both falling by 200,000 yuan. The remaining 42-count Bingguang Shuiyue, 40-count Jincheng, 32-count Lan Feng, and 20-count Lan Feng Hong Feng tubes, and 16-count Guangming and other coarse and fine yarns, consistently fell by varying amounts of 200,000 to 400,000 yuan.

Cotton

Yesterday's spot cotton market remained weak. Buyers, due to the further decline in cotton yarn, had soft sentiment. Although yarn factories had an appetite for purchases, they took advantage of the weakness to suppress prices, causing sellers to be unwilling to release goods, and transactions became more subdued, with the market remaining stagnant. Lingbao cotton's highest opening price was 2.25 million, and the lowest was 2.12 million. Because this cotton is suitable for spinning fine yarns of 20 counts or higher, and recent actual sales of fine yarns have been sluggish, the price decline was more severe than for coarse yarns, so the price also had a small decline. Shashi opened at 2.18 million, and Jingyang at 2.2 million. Because this cotton is suitable for spinning 20-count and 16-count popular yarns, the price was uniquely resilient amid the weakness, so the high-end cotton prices have been very soft in recent days, while the trend for ordinary grades has been rising. The asking prices for factory delivery were 2.15 million for Lingbao and 2.16 million for Guide. The warehouse delivery prices were 2.12 million, 2.2 million, and 2.25 million for Lingbao, 2.18 million for Chongsha, and 2.2 million for Jingyang. Kuang yarn was 1.96 million, Guide was 1.975 million, Huo Ji was 1.73 million and 1.77 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 315,000 per dan.

Cloth

When the cotton cloth market opened in the morning, traders, due to excessively high interest rates on debts, all had the intention of selling. Guangzhou merchants continued to release goods at high prices. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth once fell to 428,000 yuan, but because the listing price for Fangjian sales was higher, the market sentiment turned stronger, and the closing price for Longtou fine cloth rebounded to 432,000 yuan, but still fell by 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Five-Fu, Caiqiu, and Lanji and other fine cloths also continued to fall by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Si Jia Zi, Jinyin Yuan, Taiwan, and Ba cloth, Hankou, slightly advanced, the market is firm. The remaining Pu Bu coarse cloth and Lanbu Shilin cloth, etc., had mixed rises and falls.

Summer goods such as Palis, Fanliding, Feather Yarn, Nilo, Four-Nilo, Pangbie, Balene, White Giggy, White Straight Tribute, Gauze, Hemp Cloth, White Canvas, Baifu Nilo, and Hong Kong Luo are now falling out of favor in the market. Local and out-of-town merchants are mostly selling but not buying. The trend is sluggish, and prices are falling across the board. Those who have placed orders for delivery are seeing little profit, and some are even losing money after calculating the interest. Winter fabrics, such as flannel overcoats, are quite popular, as actual sales will begin soon.

### Rayon Industry Holds Meeting

### Dried Longan Falls by About 10%

### Rice Market Turns from Weak to Stable, Oil Prices Rise and Fall Unevenly

Yesterday, a total of over 5,060 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The market sentiment remained weak when it opened in the morning. At noon, the shops took advantage of the opportunity to take in goods, turning the weakness into stability. As a result, japonica and indica rice saw little change, and sales in the North market were slightly more active, with a slight rise. Baimian, Yinmian, and Gaoding were flat and secondary was dull. Flour sales were sluggish, and factory flour fell back by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands and Tong flour fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bran was stagnant, with little activity, and Xiu Shao was 300 to 500 yuan.

The buying power of bean cake in the countryside is not strong. Although it is currently the peak sales season, transactions are not active and remain mediocre. Only Yingkou cake increased slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean digestion was slow and continued to fall by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Red beans fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The digestion of high-quality green beans was also slow, trending towards flatness. Secondary quality lacked transactions and fell by another 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was strong and rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to be accepted by Guangzhou merchants and foreign firms, rising by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. Sesame transactions were sparse, and the trend was temporarily stable. Corn supply and demand were balanced, with no price changes. Broad beans remained stagnant and fell by another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Peas were flat. Factory transactions of wheat were still acceptable, with high-quality goods stable and secondary quality falling by 1,000 yuan. The oil market situation was one of fluctuation. Crude oil was weak at first and then popular, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean oil was stable, Qing oil fell back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, rapeseed oil also fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and digestion of cooked British oil was weak, falling by over 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil rose and fell suddenly, making it very difficult to predict. Because a lot arrived today and sales were stagnant, it plummeted by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

### Diesel Distribution Committee Begins Handling User Registration Matters

[Report from this Newspaper] The Diesel Distribution Committee of the Import Quota Distribution Office of the Transportation and Management Committee began handling registration for diesel and fuel oil users at its headquarters yesterday (Room 516 and 517, 5th Floor, Central Bank, 24 Zhongshan East Road, This City). The deadline for registration is scheduled to be the end of this month. The standards for registration are limited to the following provisions: (1) The shipping industry is limited to those registered with the Navigation Administration and the Shipping Association, and only those whose ships are in regular operation. (Those who have been registered and surveyed by the China Petroleum Corporation are no longer required to register.) (2) Diesel engine users who have not been registered and surveyed by the China Petroleum Corporation. (3) Factory coal-fired boiler users (limited to those who have registered their company, business, and factory, and have not been allocated coal and coke by the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.)

The procedures for oil allocation registration for users in various industries are handled in accordance with the following methods:

(1) Users in the above-mentioned industries should fill out an application form, together with two copies of the registration form for liquid fuel consumption of the prime mover (diesel engine), or two copies of the registration form for liquid fuel consumption of the boiler, and one copy of the past supply and production situation form, and send them to their respective industry associations (factories without industry associations may have them verified by the municipal chamber of commerce or the local competent authority and forwarded).

(2) After the Diesel Distribution Committee receives the application from each user, it will send personnel to investigate whether the demand situation and quantity are accurate and report to the committee for review and approval.

The order of priority for oil allocation by the committee has been recorded in this newspaper yesterday and will not be repeated here. According to a spokesperson for the committee to reporters, it is hoped that users in various industries who originally used coal will not switch to fuel oil in order to save the country's foreign exchange expenditure.

### Wedemeyer En Route East, Visits Pu Chun, Head of the ROK Representative Group to China

‚Äî A report by this newspaper's correspondent Zedejie

Nanjing, 21st Fast Dispatch

Mr. Pu Chun, who has just recovered from illness, bears the marks of age and overwork on his thin face, recording his old struggles. His tone and manner of speaking fully express the determination of a revolutionary. Koreans over the age of fifty have had the hatred of national subjugation rooted in them since childhood. A life of wandering has made the desire to restore the country even more pressing. There is not a single diplomatic word in his conversation.

"Needless to say, our Korean view of the Soviet Union's policies is not favorable. Nor can we be satisfied with those of the United States. The kind-hearted people of Korea unanimously oppose the current state of affairs in which the weak are sacrificed in the conflicts between great powers. The United States should change this Far Eastern appeasement policy as soon as possible."

Korean Situation: Terror and Disaster Intertwined

"It has been almost two years since the victory, and the situation in Korea is getting worse day by day. Needless to say, in the North, the Korean communists who went from Yan'an and Siberia are the only political party allowed to operate by the Soviet Union. Their style is the same as that of the Chinese communists: struggle, destruction, and unlimited expansion of military force, creating unlimited terror and disaster. Culture and education have been suspended, and industry and commerce have been destroyed. The little bit of livelihood that remained after fifty years of squeezing by Japan has also disappeared. This situation has affected the South. Refugees are flocking in, discipline is lax, society is uneasy, and all industries are showing signs of decline.

"The South is an area where parties can operate openly, but the groups and individuals who have sacrificed and struggled for many years to lead the revolution have not received the attention they deserve. Under the rule of the American military government, the comprador class and hotel old-timers have risen to prominence. Relying on their ability to speak a few words of broken English, they take orders from the American military and use their power to oppress their compatriots. The common people are almost as miserable as before. The 'liberation' of Korea is only to sub-subordinate themselves to one master and become subordinate to two masters."

South Korean Communists: Unfair Democracy

"Are the South Korean communists active?" "Ah! Very active. Other parties cannot operate in the Soviet military zone, but the Korean communists can still do whatever they want in the South. This is the American way of democracy. Whether the Korean communists engage in sabotage or riots in the South, only the lower-level actors are subject to legal penalties. The leaders can still enjoy various guarantees and conveniences. This kind of unfair democracy has aroused understandable indignation among the people of the South.

"Speaking of a united government, there is not much hope for it at the moment. But fortunately there is no hope, otherwise, once the united government is formed, the Soviet Union will definitely suggest that the United States withdraw its troops together. What kind of situation the 300,000 armed Korean communists in the North would create in Korea, anyone can predict without hesitation. No one in the South is preparing for a civil war, but the North has long had the ambition to conquer the country by force. Therefore, before peace between the United States and the Soviet Union is thoroughly achieved, talking about a united government is tantamount to opening the door to thieves. Our Korean hope is to contribute to peace in the Far East after independence. Unexpectedly, now that the date of independence is far away, peace is even more hopeless. If Korea is forcibly annexed by the Korean communists, the Far East will be in turmoil."

Maintaining Equilibrium

Small Countries Greatly Sacrificed

He had no criticism of General Hodge, only saying that he was recommended by Stilwell. He regretted that Westerners understood Orientals so little, especially Americans who understood Korea even less. He criticized the policies of the United States and the Soviet Union:

"The contradictions and conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union are caused by their own ideas and systems. But instead of seeking improvement from themselves and coming up with methods to solve them, they are cutting flesh to heal sores on small and weak countries. The small countries of Eastern Europe are being sacrificed one after another, and the situation in China has also become awkward. As for our Korea, the Cairo Conference gave us a guarantee of independence, and the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference gave us a five-year trusteeship. This decision has no historical basis and is entirely for the purpose of maintaining their current equilibrium of power, sacrificing Korea in the process. We have had three thousand years of independent history and have the absolute ability and qualification for autonomy. In the past, we revolted to resist annexation and extinction. In the future, we will still not accept co-management. We are not a conquered country, we are liberated, and we also shed blood in the war against Japan."

He believes that the United States' policy in the Far East is too weak:

"We hope that General Wedemeyer can conduct a full fact-finding mission in Korea so that the United States' policy can become more active, which will truly benefit peace in the Far East and even the world."

Keen on Restoring the Country, Will Submit a Memorandum

Mr. Pu Chun is the head of the ROK Representative Group to China. There is no reservation in his conversation. The blood and tears of the Korean people are interwoven into an eager expectation of restoring the country. They attack any obstructing forces and unreasonable measures. When General Wedemeyer arrives in Beijing, they will give him a memorandum with extensive content.

Authoritative sources say that Wedemeyer's mission is equally important to China and Korea. Because in Korea, American and Soviet troops watch each other on a line, which has been made a dividing line between two ideas and systems, and even the front line of the two major conflicts and contradictions. Mr. Pu Chun said that if the Korean problem is solved, at least the situation in the Northeast can be simplified a lot due to the departure of the Korean communists. In fact, the focus of the China problem has long shifted to the Northeast. The 38th parallel not only concerns the fate of Korea, but also the peace of China and the stability of the world.

### Summer Scenery in Hong Kong

### Hong Kong Residents in the Heatwave

‚Äî Special Correspondent Z«ê Ji√†n

Hong Kong, 17th Dispatch

Hong Kong residents seek respite from the heat, but they do not ascend Lushan or Moganshan; those who are qualified to speak of escaping the heat have long since built their retreats or villas on Victoria Peak or in the Mid-Levels of Hong Kong, or at secluded and scenic bays outside the city. When the heatwave strikes, they move their entire families there. Summer is a season of enjoyment for Hong Kong residents. Those who have villas on the mountains and coasts, and even ordinary salaried workers, go in groups of three or five to the public ice rinks by the sea to take a cool dip. Swimming is quite a popular form of entertainment in Hong Kong, akin to winter football, both being unique products of Hong Kong. Therefore, the swimming and football skills of Hong Kong residents are superior to those in the mainland.

The residents of Victoria Peak or the Mid-Levels are not ordinary families; they are at least of the "car-owning class," especially in the Mid-Levels, where the cable cars and buses are very far apart, and one must have a car to get around. Before the war, Chinese were prohibited from residing on Victoria Peak, but this prohibition was lifted after the war, and the residents of the Peak are no longer limited to foreigners. However, as of now, our compatriots do not seem to enjoy tranquility as much as foreigners do, and there are still not many yellow faces to be found on the Peak!

Victoria Peak in Hong Kong is the most successful undertaking of the British on that desolate island over the past century. I say this because it used to be a purely British residential area, and their undertakings, whether large or small, were all efforts for their own enjoyment. Therefore, even among deep mountains and rocky cliffs, the supply of water and electricity is not a problem, and the roads crisscrossing and connecting them are extremely convenient. The construction of roads and electric cable cars around the Peak is indeed a large-scale and practical construction project, which is also famous in the Far East, and many tourists from afar come to admire it. However, with the outbreak of the Pacific War, many of the Western-style houses on the Peak were destroyed by Japanese artillery, and the roads around the Peak were also marked with shrapnel, full of wounds. (There were also many Western-style houses that were dismantled by bandits for their wood, leaving only empty steel and concrete frames). The streetlights around the Peak, which resembled pearls before the war, have not yet been repaired.

Victoria Peak is more than 1,300 feet above sea level. The peak itself is 1,700 feet high, and a large barracks is built on its waist. Looking down from Victoria Peak, the entire city is in full view, and the Kowloon Peninsula is also faintly visible. Behind the mountain, one sees the connection between the water and the sky, white clouds and blue sea, which is thought-provoking. Victoria Peak is often foggy in the spring, and completely devoid of heat in the summer. The sea breeze blows in gusts, which is not common in other summer resorts.

Hong Kong is surrounded by water on all sides, and there are many natural beaches. The most famous is Repulse Bay Beach, and the most beautiful beach is Shek O Beach. As the sun sets, those beaches are filled with men and women. Many of them go into the water, but there are also many who come specifically to cool off and watch the excitement. The latter are members of the "beach gathering." Repulse Bay is behind the Hong Kong city area, about a 30-minute drive by car. The cost of the car fare and tent fee is at least five yuan per person each time, which is roughly equivalent to half a day's income for an average salaried worker. Therefore, they are fully capable of going there for fun once or twice a week. It is common to hear friends asking, "Where have you been swimming lately?" Regardless of how sluggish the Hong Kong market is, or how severe the floods in Guangdong are, regardless of whether they are car-owning or car-less, in this hot weather, Hong Kong residents always find a chance to soak in the deep green sea, inhaling the coolest air, because it is a season of enjoyment that is uniquely blessed to them.

### The Growing Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway

‚Äî Staff Reporter Li√°ng Xi«éo Zh≈çng

Wuzhou, 17th Dispatch

War brings only unparalleled cruelty to the people. The unprecedented bloody battles of 1944 in Xiang, Gui, and Qian almost swept away all weak life on two thousand kilometers of land. This unprecedented catastrophe, starting with the Battle of Hengyang and Baojian, then fully unfolded on the Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui railway lines. At that time, the tragic scenes of refugees running and shouting, calling for their children, wailing to the heavens, and stamping their feet, many people can still vividly recount. It was also in this great calamity that the two major blood vessels flowing into the Southwest with vitality‚Äîthe Xiang-Gui and Qian-Gui railways‚Äîwithered rapidly under the endless artillery fire and iron hooves, until they died. However, the vitality of the people can never be completely extinguished. From the retreat of the enemy cavalry to the victory of the war, after enduring a storm of wind and snow, the thousand-mile-long arteries were revived and grew stronger in the hands of the people.

The merger of the Xiang-Gui and Qian railways only occurred at the end of the thirty-fourth year, after the enemy surrendered. The construction of the Xiang-Gui Railway began as early as the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War and was completed in the thirty-second year, running from Hengyang to Laibin in Guangxi Province, with a total length of more than 620 kilometers. The initial intention of building the road was to pass through Liuzhou, cross Yongning, exit Longzhou, and reach the Guangxi-Vietnam border, in order to obtain material assistance from allied countries, so its military value was higher than any railway. Unfortunately, within a year, Vietnam had been occupied by the enemy, and the war in southern Guangxi soon began. Therefore, the track-laying project from Liuzhou to the border was abandoned. In order to ensure the smooth flow of the Yunnan-Burma international route, the authorities began building the Qian-Gui Railway in July of the twenty-eighth year to handle the transfer of materials, running from Liuzhou to Duyun, with a total length of 460 kilometers. It was planned to connect the Duyun construction section, but the Zhouzhu battle broke out, and the enemy cavalry took advantage of the situation to directly attack the construction walls along the road. Most of Guangxi Province also fell to the enemy, and the entire line was completely destroyed, even the roadbed was dug up haphazardly. When the enemy began to retreat in November, the Ministry of Communications began planning the restoration work the following New Year. At the same time, Yuan Menghong was appointed as the director of the Qian-Gui Railway Bureau. Until September, when the enemy surrendered, the authorities, in order to strengthen the recovery work and quickly repair the Qian-Gui and Xiang-Gui railways, merged the two railways in December, renaming them the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, still with Yuan Menghong as the director of the Engineering Bureau. After the reorganization, it actively planned the full-line restoration work. At that time, many lost territories across the country were being recovered, and the railways in the southeast and central plains needed to be urgently repaired. Moreover, some people believed that the two railways had no significant economic value, so the matter was repeatedly delayed. There seemed to be many unpleasant things involved. However, the road could not be dispensed with, so the Ministry of Communications allocated more than 7 billion yuan in construction funds, expecting to complete the repairs in two years. However, after more than a year, only half of the repairs have been completed, and it has already cost a great deal of money. It is not easy to predict how much more money will be needed. Just the various locomotives require nearly 200, and there must be 3,000 freight cars and passenger cars. The locomotives currently being used for repair are only about 30. From this, one can imagine the magnitude of the expense. However, as the authorities are proclaiming the development of the Northwest and Southwest, we cannot help but believe that the government will definitely consider construction in addition to military affairs.

In the process from the resumption of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway's track restoration project to partial opening to traffic, the difficulties and hardships are numerous. Hearing it all at once, it seems that the revival of this road is simply a miracle in the history of transportation. The railway workers were able to overcome the lack of material resources with manpower under extremely difficult conditions. In a short period of just over a year, they repaired and opened to traffic nearly 500 kilometers of track, nearly 40 locomotives, and 70 passenger and freight cars, and were able to quickly rebuild various housing, machine plants, and other facilities. This cannot but make people admire the hard work of the labor heroes, the dedicated spirit of the staff, and the outstanding leadership of Director Yuan Menghong. Now let us look at some stories of "how people become giants," and we will deeply feel how difficult and valuable construction is, thereby admonishing those "heroes" who squander the people's blood and sweat with a single explosion of a landmine, and they should stop in time.

The Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway is over 1,100 kilometers long. Except for a small section of the Guichong section east of Dong'an in Hunan Province and 90 kilometers in Guangdong, the rest is mostly in Guangxi and Guizhou, and it can be said that most of it is in Guangxi Province. However, the geographical environment and human conditions in Guangxi and Guizhou have long been known for "no three miles of flat land, no three cents of silver for the people." Especially along the railway route, such as the 460 kilometers from Liuzhou to Duyun in Guizhou, it is almost entirely a malaria-infested area of mountains and ridges, with steep cliffs and precipices. The products are scarce and the population is small. How easy is it to supply the food and drink needed by a large number of railway workers? In addition, the Qian-Gui campaign of the thirty-third year saw years of war, and the essence of the local area had long been consumed by artillery fire. After the soldiers, there was famine and epidemic, the people's vitality was lost, corpses were everywhere, and travel was difficult. Therefore, the track restoration project was extremely difficult to carry out under all these adverse conditions. Over the years, many employees have died from disease and bandits. For example, during the initial rush repair of the Gui-Liu line, near Jiaobanzhou, an engineer was brutally murdered by bandits, and it is still an unsolved case. The remote and isolated guardhouses and sheds along the line have been repeatedly plundered by bandits. On the one hand, there are man-made disasters, and on the other hand, there are natural environmental constraints, such as the transportation of materials. It is not easy to utilize roads and waterways. There is a lack of road transport vehicles, and the costs are high, and the amount of transport is not large. As for water transport, the rivers along the railway line mostly lack convenient access for boats. For example, the Hongshui River in the Liu-Lai section, the Yongfu River in the Gui-Liu section, the Weirong River, and the upper reaches of the Liujiang River are mostly turbulent rivers with many rapids and rocks. News of accidents is common. It is heard that this spring, the Railway Bureau purchased a batch of sleepers from Baishou in northern Guangxi, with a cost of about 5,000 yuan per piece, but the freight cost was as high as 1,000 yuan. As for places where boats and cars cannot reach, such as the southern Guizhou area, they can only rely on ox carts and horse transport, and the power is even more insignificant. Moreover, just when the rush repair work was in full swing, last year and this year, they happened to encounter floods. Last year, the branch line from Liuzhou to Dawan was originally the section with the best rush repair results. However, when all the engineering was ready, it was hit by a flood, and the temporary bridges that had been built, such as the Buyuan River Bridge and the Dagou River Bridge, were completely destroyed by the flood, almost making it impossible to open to traffic. After repeated repairs, it was delayed for nearly a month before the first test car succeeded in mid-August, completing the first sound of the revival of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway in Guangxi. As for this year's floods, they are rare in decades, and the road restoration project has been further constrained. The important bridges on the Xiang-Gui line, such as the Liujiang Bridge, the Weirong Iron Bridge, and the Xiangjiang Bridge, are not only difficult to build, but even salvage operations cannot be carried out. The reporter traveled from Guilin to Liuzhou, and had to "change cars" at the Luorong River before reaching his destination. The Weirong Iron Bridge has been under construction for half a year, and there are still only a few piers. Speaking of this, I really sigh for this railway. From the section north of Hechi Nandan in Guangxi to Dushan and Duyun, the troubles of the journey are even worse than in Guangxi. The mountains are steep and the roads are dangerous. So far, the major tunnels in the territory, such as Dongshanping, Gumengguan, and Wenjiang Temple, have not been opened. On the one hand, there is a deadline to open to traffic, which is indeed a difficult task.

On the other hand, due to the scourge of the war, in the winter of the thirty-third year, the enemy invaded Guizhou northward along the Xiang-Gui line, directly approaching the construction walls. From Hengyang along the railway to Dushan, the severity of the disaster was rare in the country. The destructive work was due to the strategic needs of the national army, and then continued with the enemy's defeat and retreat. The bridges, tunnels, culverts, stations, locomotives, cars, and even the rails and sleepers of the two railways were all blown up and destroyed as much as possible. After the restoration, only endless stretches of yellow earth remained along the thousand-kilometer-long dragon, and occasionally discarded scrap iron and equipment were abandoned on the side of the road, which were sold by the disaster victims to make a living. Moreover, during the rush repair of the Changchong section of the Yuehan Railway, the more than 100 kilometers of track and equipment (which were laid during the enemy's occupation for military transport and were thus able to survive) remaining between Quanzhou and Hengyang on the Xiang-Gui Railway were completely dismantled to meet the urgent needs. Therefore, when Director Yuan Menghong resumed the new construction, he truly felt like he was on a "bald land," in a situation where even a single rail spike was hard to find. The great human power began toÂèëÊå• ÂäüËÉΩ [fƒÅhuƒ´ g≈çngn√©ng] (exert its function), making up for the lack of tools as much as possible. The anonymous heroes working day and night in the machine plant used the simplest and most primitive tools to pile the abandoned locomotives, rock drills, water pumps, winches, and steel together from the barren mountains back to the plant, nailing, chiseling, cutting, and merging. Over the year, they left the factory, and the locomotives, car bodies, and cars with the glorious banner of "Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway No. X Rush Repair Team" written on them were as described above. Furthermore, the iron bridges in places like Guiliu, Yongfu, and Partridge River were almost completely dismantled and erected by hand hammers and pliers over a long period of time with both hands. The function of both hands was actually applied to the advanced transportation tool of the 19th-century atomic age. If this isn't a miracle, what is?

However, there are indeed many materials that cannot be handled by hands alone. For example, the steel beams of the iron bridge, the cement of the bridge piers, steel rail accessories, machine equipment, driving equipment, and even a small rail spike, all require reliance on foreign countries, and there is no other way. However, the import of foreign materials is difficult on the one hand and limited on the other hand (for example, the new locomotives recently distributed by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration [UNRRA] were not allocated to the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway at all). Often, the roadbed is repaired, but there are no rails, and if there are rails, there are no vehicles. It can be said to be extremely pitiful. At the beginning of the resumption of work, 100,000 barrels of cement were urgently needed, but the Ministry of Communications did not allocate them. It was only by relying on the 2,000 barrels of goods produced by the Guizhou Cement Plant in a month that they barely managed. Therefore, the work was delayed a lot. Now, although it can be transported from Guangzhou, and the UNRRA also has allocations, transportation takes time and money, which is still a difficult problem. However, once the floods pass, the temporary bridges are mostly unusable and must be rebuilt for long-term use, which is a very thorny situation.

Legal Interpretation

Evil In-Laws Sow Discord, Loving Couples Find it Hard to Grow Old Together

Wang Xiuzhen, a local woman, was introduced to Li Jun, a fellow villager, for marriage last July. The couple's relationship was quite harmonious after marriage. However, the in-laws were malicious by nature and did their best to sow discord in the relationship between their son and daughter-in-law. They quarreled almost every day under various pretexts and treated her poorly in many ways, even attempting to harm her. Although no bad consequences resulted, there is conclusive evidence. For the sake of her own safety, Xiuzhen plans to return to her mother's home. However, she is constrained by her financial situation and does not understand the legal procedures, so she has to swallow her anger, endure humiliation, and shed tears of resentment, with no joy in life. Recently, her close friend Yuan Hedi sent a letter to this column, raising several legal questions and requesting the legal advisor of this column to answer them so that Xiuzhen can escape from the sea of suffering and regain her freedom. Here are her questions:

(1) Li Jun's parents (Xiuzhen's in-laws) are directly related to Li Jun, but they instigate discord in the relationship between their son and daughter-in-law. Do they bear any legal responsibility? Can a divorce be requested? (2) Li Jun's parents have a murderous intention towards Xiuzhen, but have not caused any bad consequences. Can they be charged with attempted murder? (3) If Xiuzhen wants to request to leave her in-laws' house, must she do so in the court of the place where she lives? (4) Xiuzhen's in-laws have committed heinous crimes. As a daughter-in-law, can she sue them in court? (5) Xiuzhen's in-laws have intentionally defamed her. Can she ignore them?

[Lawyer Ya Xia answers] (1) If Xiuzhen cannot bear the abuse of her in-laws, she can ask the court to order a divorce, and the other party bears the responsibility of "fault." (2) Since the "murderous intention" has not resulted in anything, it is considered an attempt. Unless it is murder or causes serious injury, they will bear the criminal responsibility for attempted murder or attempted injury. (3) Yes, the lawsuit should be filed in the court of the place of residence or the defendant's domicile, residence, or location. (4) If there is indeed such a fact, you can sue them. (5) Yes.

### Correction of Letter and Notice to Mr. Jin

Dear Editor: We have recently read the answer in your column on July 18th to Mr. Jin Dinging, a reader from Yongjia, stating that our school is a five-year vocational school and can enroll junior high school graduates. After investigation, our school is currently only a two-year vocational school, and enrollment is limited to high school graduates. Enclosed is a copy of our school's journal for your reference. Please make a correction and we will be very grateful. Sincerely, the Private Lixin Accounting School.

### Responding to the Shen Bao's Organization of a Fund to Aid the Surviving Families of Martyred Journalists

The Jialin Scholarship Fund Board First Donates One Million Yuan

Dear Editor: Reading the section in your newspaper about raising aid for the surviving families of martyred journalists fills us with deep emotion. The government's commendation of loyalty and the one-time issuance of a pension of 30,000 yuan is primarily focused on the spirit, and material assistance seems to depend on those of us who survived. We are now enclosing a check for one million yuan, specifically donated to Mrs. Zhu Xinggong to supplement the needs of her orphaned children, as a small expression of our sympathy, which is certainly insufficient to address the situation. We believe that there were more than just Mr. Zhu among the martyred journalists in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War, and there are many more surviving families in similar circumstances. We believe that there are many benevolent people in the world who can accomplish this righteous cause. With sincere wishes for your well-being.

### Arts and Politics

‚Äî Wang Pingling

The relationship between art and politics has sparked debate in literary circles since ancient times, and a definitive answer has yet to be reached. Some proponents of art for art's sake want to transcend the political constraints on art and serve the interests of art itself; but is this possible? Humans are political animals; solitude is undesirable, and gregariousness is instinctive. Since people cannot live in isolation from the world, art as art cannot transcend and ascend to immortality. However, there is a considerable gap between the ideals and realities of politics. People's political ideals may well be far-sighted and ambitious, and they can even indulge in fantasies of a distant utopia to alleviate the bitterness of reality; but political work in practice is inevitably constrained by the realities of the environment, characterized by circuitousness, delay, waste of time and effort, lack of visible progress, and unavoidable stages. For example, the Soviet Union's "withering away of the state" and Sun Yat-sen's "Great Harmony" theory can be said to be lofty ideals. When the Nazi army was ravaging the Soviet Union, it had no choice but to launch the "Great Patriotic War" under the call of the government. To resist the invasion of Japanese militarists, China was also forced to strive for an unprecedented national defense war, which was entirely accepting the lessons of reality. Since harsh realities have befallen us, we cannot afford to cherish our feathers and indulge in illusory ideals.

Artists naturally need to have lofty ideals; but the urgent task of art is to grasp reality and reflect reality. Therefore, the subject matter and consciousness of art, that is, the content of art, cannot be detached from the real political environment to be self-admiring in one's own small world.

The content that art wants to express is nothing more than the "bright and dark" sides of real life; however, what we must pay close attention to is whether the writers' own stand is impartial, obedient to the truth, and solely dedicated to the interests of the nation? Can they truly fulfill the role of spokespersons for the people, boldly distinguish right from wrong, truth from falsehood, and guide the people from the sea of suffering in reality to the other shore of happiness, so that art workers never work for their own sake, never use art as a stepping stone, or use it to please the minds of the privileged class, or willingly become mouthpieces for a minority, making propaganda to deceive the people? Then, their praise of the light is to point out the way forward, and their exposure of the darkness is to reflect the light. People in politics should seriously consider and sincerely accept these well-intentioned suggestions and friendly criticisms.

Politics is a matter for all; every new measure in politics is closely related to the lives of the people. If the subject matter of art is not like the dreamy fantasies of romanticists and symbolists, but depicts life truthfully, then it will inevitably have a direct or indirect relationship with the implementation of politics, which is beyond doubt. Based on this decisive judgment, writers can choose not to participate in government work, and can even maintain a detached attitude, not being named in parties, groups, or associations, as a cell in a political organization; but they must closely monitor the implementation of politics as spokespersons for the people, pay attention to the party platforms and policies of various parties and their styles, and impartially urge the progress of politics; and thoroughly inform the public of the gains and losses, advantages and disadvantages that they can see through the use of skilled artistic techniques, so that the rulers of various parties, under the close supervision of the public, can only absolutely follow the aspects that are beneficial to the nation, try their best to demonstrate the achievements of their work to consolidate the party's credibility, and win the public's approval, and dare not violate the interests of the nation and destroy their political lives for their own selfish interests. Therefore, only art workers who transcend self-interest, discern truth from falsehood, distinguish right from wrong, and never cater to the world are satellites of the country, honest friends of political parties, and guides of the people.

The emotions of art workers are real, their conscience is pure, their ability to discern is correct, keen, and profound, and they spare no effort at all times to care about the future of the country and the suffering of the people. If there are writers who are good at speculation and opportunism, watching the wind and steering the rudder, conforming to bad trends, seeking personal false reputations, praising those who harm the country and the people as "progressive," cursing those who love the country and the people as "backward," and reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong, then what they write may be sold for a while, making the general public, who are blind and fond of elegance, taste it and forget its harm, and still take licking their wounds as an honor; but the eyes of the people are sharp. They see that the organic organization of the "country" has not yet withered, and their innate "patriotism" will never be diluted by these "progressive" masterpieces, and these "progressive" masterpieces will inevitably be submerged in the seabed under the tide of nationalism raised by another great era!

Furthermore, writers really need to have a political ideal as a standard for seeking subject matter; and formally participating in various political parties that have the same ideals is to accelerate the realization of political ideals, and does not hinder the freedom of writing; as long as it is not using parties and groups as a background to seek personal wealth, it will not harm the purity and dignity of artistic work. This means that art workers are the complainers of the people and the seekers of the implementation of ideals. If things that harm the country and the people happen in the parties and groups they participate in, it is tantamount to damaging their own beliefs, and they should uphold justice and give absolutely unforgiving corrections and criticisms. Only in this way can they give play to the tenacious spirit of art workers and lead the people forward! Lead the times forward! (July 11, 1947, in Chongqing.)

### Female Clerk

‚Äî Ye Feng

When I was in the mountain city, I can't remember which day it was, probably the third day after Clerk Wang was dismissed, a new person came to our section. A body with very disproportionate upper and lower parts, eyes sunken like rotten sores, and cheekbones towering high like two distant mountain peaks. Her hair was permed, and from a distance, it looked like a pile of dark clouds, a cloud of black smoke. She wore a pink shirt on top and a pair of snow-white slacks on the bottom, and on her feet were the most fashionable Hong Kong patterned leather sandals. In short, her dress was modern and urbanized. Her name was Chen Yanfang, which sounds very beautiful, and it is said that she came to fill the position of Clerk Wang.

That night (the night she came), some curious colleagues quietly went to the window of the section chief's office, which was also his bedroom, to eavesdrop, but the sound of the conversation was very low, so low that it was almost inaudible. So, one by one, the colleagues quietly walked away, as frustrated as a thief who had stolen nothing.

The next day, the section chief brought Miss Chen to the office to briefly introduce her to us. This introduction caused some surprise and attention from some colleagues because there had never been a female clerk in our section, and today Miss Chen was dressed so flamboyantly. When the section chief walked out of the office, the colleagues seemed to forget Miss Chen in front of them and began to discuss her; some said she was a vixen, some said she was a female demon, and some said she was very beautiful. I saw Miss Chen's face change from red to white, and the large amount of rouge still couldn't cover the freckles on her face. I really couldn't see where she was beautiful. I thought the colleagues were probably saying that her dress was beautiful!

She happened to sit opposite my desk, so I had more opportunities to talk to her.

She said that she loved literature and liked to write something in her spare time. She said that her articles were often published in a certain newspaper's "Literary Supplement." Obviously, she was somewhat proud of being a writer. At the same time, she said that she also loved music and had participated in several grand concerts. Her grand theory on music was that music can cultivate people's temperament. ... She envied the civilization of the city. What she cared most about the mountain city was whether there were cinemas, cafes, dance halls, big restaurants, or... I gave her a "no" answer to all of these. Immediately, I saw that she looked very annoyed, frowning, and muttering in her mouth. I seemed to hear her scolding herself for why she had to run to this remote and backward mountain city. Finally, she took a deep breath! Alas! How boring this life will be!

She said that when she was in Chongqing, she had never left the movies for a day. She could rattle off a series of stars such as Deanna Durbin, Jeanne MacDonald, Tyrone Power, Gary Cooper... I saw that she had a strong interest in the names of these people.

From the section chief to the workers, she treated everyone equally. No matter when, her face was always full of smiles. I had never seen her angry. I thought this person was probably very optimistic!

But there was one time when she really got angry.

That was one summer evening. We were all sitting in the courtyard enjoying the cool and chatting. The mischievous Xiao Zhou played such a joke on her. "Miss Chen, how old are you this year? Are you still unmarried?"

So she roared and scolded Xiao Zhou loudly, and then went to bed alone.

Every day she could receive an average of three or four letters, registered, express, or... Therefore, her main job every day was not the official documents of the section... but dear little pigeons! She patiently answered their letters separately. Sometimes I saw her laughing at the letters she had written, but I didn't know what she was laughing about.

Suddenly one night, Xiao Zhou ran to me and said that Miss Chen was leaving. As for why she was leaving, no one knew.

"Maybe she's going back to Chongqing to see a movie," some colleagues teased her.

"Maybe she's going back to Chongqing to get married," some colleagues speculated.

Sure enough, she left the next day. Before leaving, she came to see me once. Finally, she said a sentence in a foreign language that I didn't understand: "So long, I hope that I could see you again," wriggled her two large hips, imitating the demeanor of a foreign movie star, and left gracefully.

Half a year later, I went to Chongqing. One day, I accidentally saw Miss Chen walking hand in hand with an elderly man on the street. I saw that her belly was bulging high. I asked myself in surprise when Miss Chen got married and became pregnant so quickly. She walked steadily with her legs apart, and her bulging belly floated in the air like a balloon. I deliberately walked towards her. I saw that she was a little embarrassed and wanted to avoid me, but I stopped her.

"Ah! Miss Chen"!

She nodded slightly to me. The old man looked at me with displeasure. I was just about to step forward and say a few words to her, but the old man dragged her away like Xiao En in "The Fisherman's Family".

I watched the two unharmonious figures of the old man and the young woman gradually disappear before my eyes.

### Misty Rain

‚Äî L√º Zhuang

Gazing at the rainy scenery is indeed enough to trigger reverie,

Especially the misty willows by the roadside, the wind is strong...

I dream of the days when the sun shone like wine,

In the depths of the shady garden, the cuckoos call out,

Your and my names, one sentence more urgent than the last...

My mind and eyes are soaked in the misty rain,

A faint ink painting cannot disturb the heavy homesickness;

Today I am stationed in this sinful city,

The flow of time has only taken away from me a string of empty days;

Spring goes and spring comes, no one will have the slightest feeling!

Gazing at the rainy scenery is indeed enough to trigger distant reverie,

I dream of the misty rain season in my hometown,

Farmers lead water buffaloes, cuckoos skim across the sky,

Green rice seedlings, long ridges,

Together with the charm of the field women, are all depicted in the misty rain.

I should go back! I should take advantage of this misty rain sail,

Come to your team, put on the straw sandals of the past,

Grasp the anemic hand with the anemic hand!

Let us lean shoulder to shoulder, gazing at the mountain gap,

A corner of blue sky is shining; a corner of flag is fluttering!

### Returning Sail

‚Äî Monet

Claude Monet (1840‚Äì1926) was a painter who became famous for his "Impression, Sunrise," which was rejected from the Salon in 1863. The name "Impressionism" is based on this painting of his; and this name was not a praise at the time, but a ruthless sarcasm. However, Monet eventually succeeded, and has been included in the glorious page of art history, hailed as a revolutionary painter of the era, and the leader of Impressionism.

His works are mostly landscapes, and this is a representative work. (Liu Shi)

### Shakespeare Sonnet

‚Äî Zhen Le Tentative Translation

Sonnet 64

When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced

The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;

When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed,

And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;

When I have seen the hungry ocean gain

Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,

And the firm soil win of the watery main,

Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;

When I have seen such interchange of state,

Or state itself confounded to decay;

Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--

That Time will come and take my love away.

This thought is as a death, which cannot choose

But weep to have that which it fears to lose.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 356

‚Äî Ye Jingfeng

Look at the way he walks, like an oriole hopping, one step forward, then a limp, it really is not pleasing to the eye. Furthermore, the secret work he is doing at this time, according to himself, this "getup" is a "disguise"; inconspicuous, not attracting attention; in the eyes of the Japanese and puppet secret agents, it is just a small, down-and-out household; it cannot be said that he is an anti-Japanese student.

These past few days, how he has eaten and how he has slept, I don't know. But that small, long, round face is still red in the black, and his two small arms are still so round and bulging, not a bit thinner. His face still has a silly and cunning smile.

"Have you found Aunt Ji?" Yin Jun told me that Little Tiger was looking for Yaoqun.

"I just came from Aunt Ji's place, and also Mr. Wu and Team Leader Shen. Aunt Ji said she wouldn't come here, and asked me to accompany you there... It's about ten miles away, you can go by car or on foot."

Walking on foot is certainly not as effortless as taking a car. Moreover, since I am appearing here as number fifteen, walking is more troublesome than taking a car; because there are too many Japanese "sentries" along the way, and the procedures are too many, it is better to drive straight through than to go through the formalities. (The car is affixed with military symbols).

The car was driven by me, but the route was guided by Little Tiger, left turn, right turn, and in a blink of an eye, we arrived at a place that looked like a small village. Under Little Tiger's guidance, I was told to park the car at the foot of a big tree. In the car, Little Tiger kept looking around, checking for "sentries". This is where he is meticulous and cautious. Getting out of the car, he was still not at ease, looking back and listening again and again, determined that no one was following, and that no sentries were paying attention, he then said commandingly: "Old man, let's go!"

"How much further?" I asked him casually.

"Not far; mountain paths and field ridges, the car can't go... We'll be there after crossing two more small hills. Let's walk slowly, old man." He was considerate of the disability of my two legs.

Okay. "Not far," one hilltop, then another hilltop; according to my calculation, it was at least five or six miles, and all of them were small roads, mountain paths.

On the road, I repeatedly questioned him, "What have you been doing these past few days?" "Where have you been?" "When did you find Aunt Ji?" He always answered vaguely, cleverly diverting to unrelated matters. I felt that he had some unspeakable secrets, and must be somewhat disappointed; so I stopped asking, and only told him some of my experiences.

"We're here!" Standing on a small hilltop, Little Tiger pointed to a forest in the small valley; there seemed to be several thatched cottages in the forest. "Look there, old man." He raised his hand and pointed to the west end of the opposite small hill, a distant point. I tried my best with my five-hundred-degree nearsighted eyes, but couldn't see anything; so I took out my binoculars and focused on the point of light.

It turned out that the blurry place I was looking at just now was about a thousand meters away. Along the foot of the north mountain, there was a highway, winding to the foot of the north mountain, near the foot of the mountain, there was a bridge. Looking at the east end of the mountain again, that highway went straight through, all the way to the distant mountain gorge.

### Church Bells

‚Äî Shi Bei

Living in this mundane and noisy city for a long time always feels depressing. The best, most beautiful, and quietest place here is this corner of the church.

As summer deepens, the paulownia leaves around here are even more lush and green, with branches and trunks towering into the sky. Next to it is a light green wooden fence, and the ground is covered with velvety green grass. Roses and those small trumpet-like slender flowers are dotted around the ground like a crown. In the middle of the bushes, a brown-red church stands out, with a white cross erected on the roof, radiating sparkling white light. The silk shade and red house reflect each other under the azure sky. All of this carries a suppressed melancholy and an expectant emotion in its solemnity‚Äîwhen a cool breeze blows, gently shaking the paulownia leaves all over the trees, rustling and resounding, the surrounding vastness arouses a slight tremor, which further deepens the color of this mood.

This church is located in such a city‚Äîwhere the gap between rich and poor is the most obvious, the struggle for fame and wealth is the most intense, and evil and vanity are the deepest... Compared with this, the church is obviously a sharp satire. But precisely because of this, I love to walk here, slow down my pace, and wander by the low green fence. I love to see the red walls exposed in the middle of the green shade, I love to see the silver-white brilliance emitted by the cross...

I have heard the church bells in this church. They are clear and bright, but also sorrowful and subdued. Every chime of the bells weighs heavily on me. This was originally to lead all living beings to the realm of loyalty, love, and supreme goodness; Christ was nailed to the cross in order to wash away the sins of mankind, and many martyrs were able to rest in peace with this bell sound. People made confessions and prayers to create new days. This is the earliest revelation that the bell sound gave people.

Listening to the bells, I thought of an old English female pastor who led me to pray a few years ago, reciting beautiful verses in a low voice, and thinking of how she taught me to listen to the appeal of this bell sound to the human spirit. But now this can only evoke a trace of memory. I watched evil greedily growing everywhere, and there was clamor and noise everywhere; in this city, the ferocity of carnal desires was even more exposed, and people were frantically pursuing power and money. Reality gave me too many lashes, and I sighed for the old kind soul and for those kind and forbearing people!

Naturally, I still love this church and love to hear these bells. Yesterday I walked over there again. This time, listening to the rising and falling mournful bells, each chime evoked more sighs from me. As I walked, I listened to the bells slowly and continuously ringing. However, in front of me, I still couldn't stop. The shouts and scoldings in the city, and the atmosphere filled with dust and malice. In the past, I had placed unlimited hopes, expecting this bell sound to sternly rebuke the sins of the penitents, and to use emotion to proclaim the sacred and demonic nature of humanity. Now I have temporarily shelved such wishes.

In the years to come, day and night will follow each other, and the bells of this church will continue to ring forever, but how do the people in this city feel about these bells? I hope that one day, while waiting for the bells to ring, the melodious and gentle sound waves will make my mood soar, and from then on I can rest in the sea of loving and mutual assistance, with no more treachery and evil.

Hurbine Jottings

### The Issue of Dismissing Professors

‚Äî Shi Lang

Recently, rumors have been circulating everywhere that certain university professors will be dismissed; the University Professors Friendship Association in this city has also held several meetings for this reason.

This rumor can now be denied. Because the university is a sacred place for academic research, professors on the one hand cultivate talents for the country, write books and establish theories, and on the other hand lay the sacred foundation for Chinese culture and science.

In order to cherish China's few academic talents, university professors should be given extra care so that they can teach with peace of mind; in these years of war and chaos, create an academic atmosphere for China.

The conversation with Vice Minister Hang Zheng of the Ministry of Education further confirms that what we see is not a fallacy.

Vice Minister Hang said that the Ministry of Education has never authorized any university to dismiss professors!

This statement is so straightforward and frank. Who can still doubt that the dismissal of professors has been authorized?

Vice Minister Hang said that university presidents have full power to hire professors, and the list of professors that each school intends to hire does not need to be sent to the Ministry of Education for review. This means that each school has the freedom to hire professors and is absolutely not subject to any restrictions.

This explanation will clarify the rumors that are circulating in various universities at present, which is worthy of our joy and excitement.

### The Invisible: America's New Navy

‚Äî Bai Shi

The U.S. Navy is currently undertaking its most significant peacetime mission in history, which is to join forces with Britain to safeguard global trade routes. According to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, there are as many as three hundred "active" warships participating in this non-combat operation‚Äîbecause it is, in fact, a rehearsal for an "invisible naval war."

The so-called "invisible naval war" is not an imagined operation for a future great war: this term truly represents the entire naval strategy of the United States from now on. In other words, the United States is currently implementing a major plan to transform its most powerful navy of all time into a large fleet of "super submarines."

This plan has long surpassed the "ideal" stage. According to a report in the Washington-published "U.S. News," the Navy Department is requesting Congress to authorize the construction of 4,000-ton experimental submarines, and Congress has already allocated 30 million U.S. dollars for this purpose. Half a dozen completely new types of submarines have already been designed; and a considerable portion of the 4.428 billion U.S. dollars in the 194_ fiscal naval budget will be at the disposal of the "undersea warfare strategists."

To glimpse some of the truth about the "new American navy" that is taking shape, it is necessary to first dispel existing notions about the size, function, offensive power, and cruising range of underwater vessels. The submarines used in World War II are almost as obsolete as the old warships that Admiral Nelson used to defeat Napoleon's combined French fleet.

New "battleships" and "aircraft carriers" will be extra-large submarines. The former will be equipped to launch missiles and rockets‚Äîand to carry out large-scale coastal bombardments. The latter will have spaces to accommodate aircraft and decks for launching jet-propelled planes, as well as carrying large groups of "Marines" for landing operations.

Even new methods of transporting jet-propelled aircraft under the sea are being studied, or may be considered obsolete, because the increasing improvements in missiles and rockets will render pilots useless or relegate them to the position of observers.

The work undertaken by "PT boats" during World War II‚Äîsuch as harassing enemy transport ships, reconnaissance, raids into harbors‚Äîwill also be borne by underwater vessels. These will be mobile, small submarines that can slip into estuaries or pass through harbor defenses to place timed atomic bombs.

Even transport ships and supply ships will navigate underwater to reach remote bases. Naval Department designers believe that this vital auxiliary force, if it remains on the surface, will become the weakest link in the offensive and defensive strategy of the atomic age.

In the "invisible naval war" strategy, perhaps the most revolutionary feature is its anticipation of using atomic energy to propel underwater vessels, making their speed similar to that of the fastest surface vessels today. According to the Washington correspondent for the "Chicago Sun," G. Penkrowd, this plan "has already undergone detailed study, and according to scientists and naval leaders, it is not as far from full realization as most people think."

Due to this detailed research, the use of atomic energy to propel warships may be realized sooner than those predicted "non-military" uses‚Äîsuch as propelling locomotives, powering factories, and heating water for city residents.

According to J. Minnefer, a reporter for the "New York Herald Tribune," the U.S. determination to "submerge its navy" has clearly been spurred by two post-war developments. The first is the discovery of German submarine models from the end of the war, which were far more advanced than any submarines the Allied nations possessed at the time. If the enemy had completed their "snorkel" submarines and new torpedoes earlier, the outcome of the war might have been very different.

The second factor is the "atomic bomb tests at Bikini," which have shown that submarines are less vulnerable than surface vessels.

In addition, there is also the fact that the number of submarines lost in combat was less than that of any other type of vessel.

The lessons learned at "Bikini," as well as those from the study of captured German submarines, are now being incorporated into the design of American "super submarines"‚Äîincluding a type of torpedo equipped with a "proximity fuse" that will explode even if it does not hit the target.

According to Rear Admiral C.W. Stayer, the Navy Department's "undersea warfare strategist," tomorrow's undersea warship "will not merely be a surface vessel capable of submerging, but a full-fledged, true undersea vessel. It may well become the primary weapon of naval warfare tomorrow... This is the age of atomic energy, and also the age of true submarines, which can remain underwater for months on end without needing to surface periodically to recharge their batteries."

As for the American vessels that will remain on the surface, their equipment will prioritize submarine detection instruments and anti-submarine weapons. This indicates that surface vessels will primarily be used to support and protect underwater warships in the future. These surface vessels will also be unrecognizable in shape and structure compared to today's warships. They will be faster; their superstructures will be reduced to near zero, making them less visible; and their hulls will be built to better withstand atomic bomb blasts.

The advocates of traditional "giant battleships" will probably continue to clamor among naval leaders for years to come. However, all indications suggest that current U.S. naval plans greatly diminish the usefulness of battleships in atomic warfare. Only two battleships are currently in service: the "Missouri" in the Atlantic Fleet and the "Iowa" in the Pacific Fleet.

The battleship "Kentucky" and the battlecruiser "Hawaii" are both being converted into vessels for launching missiles and rockets.

When the U.S. Navy launches its "invisible naval war," it will not only be the "elders" in the naval community who will have to acknowledge that they are "outdated" and reform their thinking.

### Old Madame Xu

‚Äî Ji Ming

People today often use the phrase "Old Madame Xu, still full of charm" to describe the beauty of a woman in her twilight years. In reality, Old Madame Xu was only twenty-four years old. In the past, this would have been considered middle-aged, but today, she would be considered among those "whose plum blossoms are still on the branches," and should not be hastily labeled as "middle-aged." Moreover, some mistakenly believe that Old Madame Xu was the mother of Cao Cao's ÂæêÊØç. This not only leads to the accusation of misattribution but also detracts from the virtuous reputation of a wise mother. For the sake of clarification, I respectfully present the relevant information from the "Southern History: Biographies of Empresses and Consorts."

Southern History: Consort Xu of Emperor Yuan of Liang was beautiful and fierce. She started with the Emperor in Xiangdong. After the Emperor ascended the throne, he made her a consort. She was ill at ease in the palace and often had affairs with attendants and Ji Jiang, a petty official from Piaoyang. Although the Emperor knew of this, he feared her fierceness and did not dare to ask. Before this, the Emperor was wounded by an arrow in the eye during the suppression of Hou Jing's rebellion, losing sight in one eye. Whenever Consort Xu knew the Emperor was coming, she would only apply makeup to half of her face to await him. When the Emperor sought her out, she would be greatly angered and leave. Sometimes, he would order her to sing, and she would sing "My Vague Sentiments" in response. The Emperor was displeased by this and did not visit her for years. The Consort believed she had succeeded in her plan and became even more promiscuous. Jiang told others, "The horse of Liyang may be old, but it is still potent. Old Madame Xu may be old, but she is still very amorous." Later, she offended the Emperor and was deposed.

From this, it can be seen that Emperor Yuan did not not love Old Madame Xu. However, she constantly offended him, so he had to bear the pain of cutting her off.

### Odds and Ends from America

‚Äî Xu Shuyuan

There are quite a few Americans who claim to be experts on China. After gaining a superficial understanding of the Four Books and Five Classics, they start to show off their ignorance and even write books and articles. When mentioning the "Book of Rites," they invariably cite "Men and women should not touch hands when giving or receiving." One female student even asked me on a public bus, "If it's really true that men and women shouldn't touch hands, then what do couples do?" I told her that there were separate rituals for couples, and she finally understood that there are also handshakes, embraces, and kisses in China. America also has a book similar to the "Book of Rites," called "Etiquette," which is a grand view of things, even including the format of invitation cards. But if you follow the rules in the book, it may not work in America. Americans usually don't send out invitations for gatherings other than grand banquets; a phone call is enough. There are many customs that are not included in the American etiquette books, so I am writing them down here for self-funded students who are about to go abroad as a reference: When you are walking with a girlfriend, you walk on the street side and let her walk on the side near the buildings. After crossing the road, change direction and immediately switch positions. If you let the woman walk on the street side, she will definitely think that you are intentionally insulting her, because that means you are treating her like a prostitute. If the two of you walk into a restaurant or other place and there are flowerpots or other obstacles blocking the way at the entrance, when she walks on the side with the flowerpots, you cannot walk on the left side of the flowerpots. This will cause an argument because American women are very superstitious and you should pay special attention. If you love her, you should tell her you love her every day, otherwise she will get angry and accuse you of forgetting a phrase. When you sneeze or yawn, you must say "Excuse me," otherwise she will protest that you forgot another phrase. After she kisses you, don't immediately wipe off the lipstick with a handkerchief in front of her. You should wipe it off when she's not paying attention. If she says her feet hurt after walking into a movie theater, that's another way of telling you to take off her shoes for her. American women like to use their own forks to pick up food and put it in your mouth in front of other guests. If you are too embarrassed to accept it and refuse to eat, that is extremely impolite. American women like to swear. When the conversation gets heated, they will swear. You have to go with the flow and quickly give in, otherwise she will cry and you will have to apologize. When you go to America, you have to learn how to whistle. Whistling and applauding are both ways of praising beauty. The person you whistle at will not only not be angry, but will also turn around and smile, saying "Thank you." (26)

### Scientific Essay: The Sky Dock (Part 1)

‚Äî Gu Junzheng

If mankind can avoid atomic warfare, then we will surely be able to create a sky dock, to serve as a starting point for spacecraft traveling to the moon.

Even if atomic energy is used in spacecraft, and there is no need to add fuel en route, the sky dock itself has many appealing and useful features that are worth our efforts.

What can support this sky dock in space? This is the first question that anyone who hears this plan will ask. At first glance, it seems impossible, but in reality, its principle is very simple.

Imagine a high mountain, with its peak standing in space. On this peak, there is an imaginary cannon. We know that the horizontal range of a cannon varies with the initial velocity of the bullet. If this initial velocity is extremely high, then it may even circle the Earth and have the possibility of shooting back at itself. This initial velocity is approximately five miles per second, and is called circular velocity, because an object shot out at this speed can continue to circle the Earth indefinitely.

Why doesn't this object fall to the ground? The answer is: It is not that it doesn't fall, it just never falls to the ground.

Don't you understand what that means? Then you can think of it this way: Any bullet that is fired will simultaneously be making two movements. The first movement is due to the initial velocity from the muzzle; the second movement is due to the attraction of gravity. These two movements combine to create a curved trajectory.

If the initial velocity of the bullet is greater, then the curvature of the trajectory will be flatter. If the initial velocity is increased to a certain limit, it will be possible to make the curvature of the trajectory match the curvature of the Earth's surface. At this time, although the projectile continues to fall towards the ground, because the rate at which the Earth's surface curves downward is exactly the same as the rate at which the projectile falls due to gravity, it will never fall to the ground.

When any projectile is shot out along the tangent of the Earth, if its speed reaches five miles per second, the above phenomenon can occur. It is impossible for a cannon to create such an initial velocity, and even if it were possible, it would not be of any use to us.

However, it is possible for a spacecraft to create such an orbit around the Earth at a height of 500 miles, and this is much easier than traveling to the moon. Once the spacecraft is in this orbit, it does not need to consume any more fuel, whether it circles the Earth once, twice, ten times, twenty times, or countless times. Only when the pilot wants to return to Earth will fuel be needed. At this time, the fuel consumed is used to reduce the speed of the spacecraft, causing it to fall into the atmosphere and make a landing. Such an ideal will surely be realized before lunar travel. After this ideal is realized, we can use sixty-eight tons of fuel to bring one ton of equipment to this orbit, and then build a permanent sky dock there.

Once this dock is built, then not only will lunar travel become easier, but also transportation between other planets. Because, first, at an altitude of five or six hundred miles, the gravitational pull of the Earth is very small, which is a special convenience for the spacecraft's progress. Second, at an altitude of five or six hundred miles, the air is very thin, and the spacecraft has almost no air resistance to overcome. Third, the dock itself already has a speed of five miles per second relative to the Earth, so if the spacecraft departs from here, it can increase its speed by five miles per second compared to departing from the Earth.

### The Soviet Fire

‚Äî Qiyuan

The Soviet Union is a fire in the world after World War II. To what extent will this fire spread? Will it eventually spread to every corner of the continent, or will it be submerged by the vast sea? This is not something that today's clever people can predict. Those who have studied chemistry know that the composition of a fire has three parts: a core, an inner flame, and an outer flame. Therefore, the American international affairs writer CFestet Duller also divides the Soviet fire into three parts (zones): core, inner perimeter, and outer perimeter.

The core zone includes the land of the Soviet Union at the time of its founding in 1917, and the various republics that later joined the Soviet Union, as well as northern Finland, southern Finland's area with direct access to the Baltic Sea, the three small republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the northern part of East Prussia in Germany, the eastern half of Poland, the eastern part of Czechoslovakia (the so-called Czltpztbo-Uktzide), Bessarabia and Bukovina in Romania, Gangladuvan, southern Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, and even the Turkish provinces of Kars and Erzurum are likely to be close to this zone.

The inner perimeter zone includes all areas close to the core zone that, while not yet considered part of the Soviet Union, are under Soviet military control, such as Poland in Central Europe, eastern Germany, eastern Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania. In Asia, Outer Mongolia, the Changchun Railway Zone in northeastern China, Dalian, Xinjing, and northern Korea, etc. Recently, it may also extend to Greece, Iran, Turkey, Kurdistan, and southern Korea.

As for the outer perimeter zone, because it is farther away from the core, direct action cannot be taken. Therefore, three methods are adopted for independent countries and colonies: (1) In colonies, encourage revolution and independence movements. (2) In independent countries, collude with the communist parties of those countries. (3) If there is no communist party or left-wing presence, encourage left-wing factions.
