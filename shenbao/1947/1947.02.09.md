### The U.S. Mediation in China Has Ended; U.S. Troops Will Withdraw from China as Soon as Possible: Marshall Reports at Press Conference

[Washington, March 7th, Agence France-Presse] Secretary of State Marshall recently held his first press conference, explaining that the U.S. government's decision to end the mediation of China's internal strife was due to the United States' lack of interest in this kind of mediation that existed in name only. He also stated that U.S. troops stationed in China would be withdrawn as soon as possible within the scope of possibility. However, the troops stationed in Qingdao will not be withdrawn for the time being because they are training the Chinese navy to use coastal and other warships. Qingdao is the only location where the U.S. military intends to remain.

[Washington, March 7th, Central News Agency] The newly appointed U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, with the strong and heroic demeanor he maintained as Army Chief of Staff, held his first press conference this afternoon since returning from China. Mr. Marshall spoke for a total of forty-five minutes, discussing several world issues but not mentioning U.S.-Soviet relations. Today's press conference was unusual, with some information that could be published, some that could not, and some that could not be published in his name. Mr. Marshall did not comment on any issues regarding Europe or the policies and recommendations for the upcoming Moscow conference. Mr. Marshall's serious demeanor made reporters, who were accustomed to interviewing and responding with ease and experience, feel cold. Mr. Marshall discussed more than ten issues, the main points of which are as follows:

Regarding general policy, he will follow the policies of Truman and Byrnes, that is, to strengthen the United Nations with all efforts, making it a tool for discussing international issues and maintaining world peace, and to make the power of the United States have an impact on international events. He will actively strive for peaceful resolutions based on this policy, making it a solid foundation on which the United Nations can function.

Regarding the China issue, Mr. Marshall stated that the United States has ended its participation in the Three-Man Team and the Peiping Executive Headquarters. The State Department's statement did not mention the Marine Corps, but this point was already stated in his January 8th statement. The Executive Headquarters has reached a state where it cannot function. Therefore, he himself, President Truman, and the State Department believe that mediation that exists in name only should be terminated, otherwise, it will cause confusion among the general public, especially the Chinese people, and thus lead to many other complex concepts.

Small Number of U.S. Troops Remain Stationed in Qingdao; 500 Million Loan Stored Unused

The purpose of the Marine Corps going to China was special, namely to send the two million Japanese troops in China and one million Japanese troops in the Northeast (at least) back to their country. This task was practically completed in May of last year, but a small number of Marine Corps continued to protect the Executive Headquarters, the transportation line from Qinhuangdao, Tanggu, to Peiping, and to ensure the safety of its personnel, which was indeed necessary. At the same time, the U.S. Marine Corps was also responsible for protecting personnel distributed in a considerably vast area of the mainland. The Executive Headquarters had to contact the execution team by plane every week, and also had radio contact every day. After the United States withdrew from the Executive Headquarters, the security mission of the Marine Corps also ended. The general public has misunderstandings about the handling of the U.S. Marine Corps. The United States' policy towards China was clearly explained in President Truman's statement on December 18th of last year and in his own statement on January 8th of this year. The number of Marine Corps stationed in China is very small and has specific duties. Currently, there are still a small number of Marine Corps in Qingdao, assisting in training the Chinese navy to defend China's coastal areas from pirates and smuggling activities. The water there is deep and the sea is vast, and the U.S. Seventh Fleet is anchored there.

Regarding the 500 million loan to China, Mr. Marshall stated that President Truman's statement on December 18th had explained it clearly. Mr. Truman stated that the U.S. Export-Import Bank plans to lend another 500 million yuan to Chinese government-run institutions and private enterprises. The agreement to implement this loan plan must be based on the policy announced by the U.S. government on December 15th, 1945. This 500 million U.S. dollars is stored for use and has not been spent. (More on Marshal's talk, see page 4)

[Washington, March 7th, United Press] Secretary of State Marshall issued a written statement at a press conference. When mentioning China in the statement, he said that he, the President, and the State Department have all given up mediating in China because they all feel that mediation is "not appropriate" while negotiations with artillery fire or the like continue. This was Mr. Marshall's first decision to attend a press conference after taking office, and the first time he made an important statement. The frankness and comprehensiveness of its content have not been seen in the State Department for many years. About 150 reporters participated, twice as many as usual.

### U.S. May Impose Additional Tariffs on Subsidized Goods Imported into the United States; U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai Issued a Notice Yesterday

[Our Report] Since our government announced a 100% export subsidy, foreign businesses have had mixed reactions. Yesterday, the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai specifically issued a circular to relevant exporters, informing them of the provisions in the U.S. tax law regarding foreign countries adopting export subsidies for reference. The circular stated: According to the tax law passed and implemented in the United States in 1930 and the U.S. customs regulations, if goods that are imported into the United States from foreign countries and are subject to U.S. tariffs are subject to a subsidy system in the exporting country at the time of export, the United States will also levy an additional tax equal to the amount of the subsidy when the goods are imported into the United States. According to the interpretation of this provision, with the export subsidy system adopted by our country, in future export trade to the United States, except for a few exports that can be imported into the United States duty-free, such as bristles and tung oil, other taxable exports will hardly be able to obtain the benefits of export subsidies. Regarding exports to the United States, the U.S. Consulate also requires exporters to list any discounts, rebates, or subsidies for the exports on the U.S. Consulate invoice for reference. According to the U.S. Consulate, the United States had exceptions for some economically backward countries when implementing this tax rule during the war. Moreover, assisting China's reconstruction is originally the policy of the United States. Therefore, it may be possible to consider exceptions for the current situation. However, it still remains to be proven by facts.

### U.S. Will Protest China's Exchange Settlement Methods

[Washington, March 7th, United Press] Government officials recently stated that regarding China's recent draft exchange settlement methods, which impose a 50% surcharge on certain imported goods, the United States may formally protest to China after it is formally notified to Washington. Official opinion is that China's method of levying import surcharges and granting 100% subsidies on exports will encourage export trade. Although it is legal for Chinese exporters to profit from foreign trade by obtaining an exchange rate equivalent to the black market, import surcharges may cause protests from the United States because this method will thwart the United States' efforts to reduce trade barriers and allow free flow of world trade. This matter is purely a matter of principle. China has not yet formally notified the United States, but the State Department has fully considered this matter and will express something to China as soon as it receives formal notification.

Because the main force of the Communist 4th and 9th Divisions was almost completely destroyed in the battle of Caojiazhuang, the National Army's advance was like destroying rotten branches and leaves. By 4:00 PM, it could control Jindoushan north of Xintai City, and was recaptured by the National Army. The Communist troops fled in panic to the east, and the National Army took advantage of the victory and recovered Xintai City in one fell swoop at 5:00 PM.

The National Army advancing south from Laiwu is approaching Xintai, and the main force of the National Army has approached the outskirts of Linyi. Linyi is now like a candle in the wind.

He Long was punished for losing Zhangjiakou and has already surrendered. (4) The Central Government has decided not to punish the officers and soldiers who surrender, and will give them important positions. Hao Pengju and Zhang Shaowu are the best examples. Now their subordinates are treated the same as the National Army, not only do they have rice and flour to eat, but they also serve the country and have a bright and happy future. (5) The National Army attacking Linyi has already surrounded it from all sides. If you do not surrender, you will have no way out and will be destroyed together.

### Performance of Various Ministries, Commissions, Provincial and Municipal Governments Subject to Thorough Evaluation by Chairman's Order; Five Measures Stipulated, to be Completed Before the End of April; Personnel of Northeast Mines and Factories Commended by Order

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Chairman Chiang is paying close attention to the administrative achievements of various ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments in the 35th year, and has specifically ordered the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee to thoroughly evaluate them, determine their merits and demerits, and use this as a basis for rewards and punishments. Five evaluation measures have been approved: (1) The evaluation of the performance of various provinces and municipalities will continue to be carried out by the Executive Yuan according to the original methods. The evaluation of the performance of the various ministries and commissions and the Auditing Department and the Ministry of Personnel of the Executive Yuan will be initially reviewed by the respective governing Yuan and then submitted to the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee for comprehensive review, so as to give full play to the spirit of graded evaluation. (2) The evaluation items will focus on the most important central tasks. (3) The evaluation method will first summarize and review the usual inspections, evaluations, work reports, work progress, evaluation reports and other materials, and then conduct thorough audits. When necessary, personnel will be sent to conduct on-site random checks of units considered to have the best and worst performance, so as to prove the actual basis for rewards and punishments. (4) The evaluation method will adopt a scoring system and formulate rewards and punishments. (5) The evaluation of the performance of the various ministries, commissions, and provincial and municipal governments must be completed by the end of April this year. The affairs of various Yuan and commissions must be sent to the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee before the end of March this year for joint processing.

[Further Dispatch] Since the central government took over the major mines and factories in Fuxin, Huanggu Tun, Anshan, Fushun Xiaoman, and other places in the Northeast, it has been learned that many personnel at all levels, such as workers, mine and factory managers, and warehouse managers, have been loyal to the mines and factories, the machinery, the preservation of materials, and the completion of projects. There is no shortage of heroic acts of self-sacrifice, which are astonishing. It is reported that Chairman Chiang highly praised the enthusiasm of the personnel of various factories and mines in the Northeast for their loyalty to the country, and has telegraphed the Northeast Headquarters to give them commendations, and ordered a thorough investigation of those who died in the line of duty and provided preferential treatment to their families, in order to encourage them and comfort the loyal souls.

### Li Zonghuang Talks to Reporters About the Past Work of the Evaluation Committee

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Supreme National Defense Council recently decided to merge the Central Design Bureau and the Party and Government Work Evaluation Committee into the Design and Evaluation Office, directly under the National Government. Today, reporters specifically visited Secretary-General Li Zonghuang of the Evaluation Committee, who answered the following questions:

Question: Your committee will be merged with the Central Design Bureau into the Design and Evaluation Office and be subordinate to the National Government. I wonder if there is any legal basis for this, and whether there is any conflict between its powers and the Five Yuans?

Answer: The powers of the Evaluation Office do not conflict with those of the Five Yuans. As for being subordinate to the National Government, it is a necessity in fact. The administrative three-link system should indeed be spread throughout all departments, but only the highest organ, the National Government, has the power for overall design and overall evaluation. There is also no conflict between evaluation and supervision. Supervision focuses on the illegal and derelict behavior of officials, while evaluation focuses on work efficiency. Supervision is under the ruling power, while evaluation is the balance of power itself. Over the years, the supervision and evaluation systems have only had the effect of mutual benefit and have not had the drawbacks of duplication and conflict.

Question: What are the gains and losses after your committee merges with the Central Design Bureau?

Answer: Our committee and the Central Design Bureau are important departments of the administrative three-link system. After the merger of the institutions, there are only benefits and no disadvantages, because a precise and reasonable design must be based on facts and suggestions for improvement provided by the evaluation in order to be accurate and effective. If the evaluation does not fully understand the nature of the work design and national policy, and only focuses on the trivial affairs work, it will lose the main purpose of the evaluation. Therefore, the three parts of design, execution, and evaluation work must be coordinated with each other at all times. In the past, in order to seek contact between the three parts of the work, a joint meeting of the bureau, committee, and office (Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics) was established. This reorganization, which is also subordinate to the National Government together with the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics, can better exert the effect of active contact, and after the merger, the expenses and personnel can be greatly reduced, which is more in line with the principles of streamlining staff and reforming politics.

Question: The outside world does not understand the work of your committee very well. Can you briefly tell us about the general situation of your past work, selecting the main points?

Answer: Our committee was established in October of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940) and has been in existence for six years. Because its nature is a staff agency and the evaluation is confidential, it does not focus on publicity to the outside world, so the outside world does not understand it very well. However, since its establishment, in terms of political evaluation alone, it has inspected 1,604 government agencies and submitted requests to abolish more than 40 agencies. There are 612 agencies that have been supervised by our committee to establish design and evaluation committees. There are 1,753 suggestions for improvement in economic construction, local autonomy, grain administration, conscription, drug prohibition, and general administration, which have been submitted to the Chairman for approval and handed over to the competent authorities for handling, which is not without benefit to the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Before the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the annual work plans drafted by central and local agencies were huge and impractical, or only had budgets but no work plans. Our committee pointed out its malpractices and used a scoring method to judge the merits and demerits of the progress of its plans. Therefore, the plans of the agencies gradually became practical, and the work reports were also more accurate than before. Therefore, the average results have also improved year by year, and have indeed achieved the effect of changing the social atmosphere. The evaluation methods used are also improving day by day.

Question: What are the differences between the evaluation methods used by your committee now and in the past? What are the advantages and disadvantages?

Answer: In the past, there were too many evaluation items, and the preliminary evaluation was not carried out, so our committee directly evaluated them, which was prone to the disadvantage of being broad and neglecting the details. In addition, too many reports were compiled and delivered too late, resulting in improvement suggestions often losing their timeliness. Now, many design and evaluation committees have been established in various agencies. Recently, the Chairman instructed that in the future, we will strengthen the supervision of various agencies to implement graded evaluation and regular evaluation, limit the central tasks, and focus on timeliness, and strictly reward and punish them. Our committee will focus on overall review and review in the future, and its effectiveness will be further increased. After the merger, it will be able to connect with design and budgeting, and will be able to exert its effectiveness even more.

### Tani Hisao Tried for the Third Time; Prosecutor Points Out that the Massacre Was a Planned Act; Court Announces Regular Continuation of Debate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Japanese war criminal Tani Hisao continued his third public trial on the afternoon of the 8th. Tani first made a statement on the evidence presented on the 7th: (1) Most of the evidence presented was outside the Zhonghua Gate, during the two days of December 12th and 13th. At this time, there was fierce fighting, and residents should have fled to safe areas. (2) There was fierce fighting all day on the 12th, and there was no time to kill civilians. It can be said that it would never have happened, and it would never have been allowed, and it could not have been unknown. (3) Most of the areas are outside the defense zone of the accused's troops and are located in the 114th Division Brigade. The above three points, please pay special attention to the court.

The Presiding Judge Announced a Collective Massacre

Then, Presiding Judge Shi announced the collective massacre case: (1) After Tani's troops entered the city on December 12, more than 51,000 captured National Army soldiers were imprisoned at the foot of Mount Mufu and immediately escorted to Caoxie Gorge, Xixia, where they were shot with machine guns, and then the bodies were thrown into the river. There are eyewitnesses who escaped death at the time, who can be questioned immediately. Tani argued: The accused's troops stayed at Zhonghua Gate and did not know about this incident. It may have been done by the navy, or by the main force. Presiding Judge Shi continued to announce (2) On December 15, more than 9,000 civilians and National Army soldiers were escorted to the Xixia torpedo camp and collectively shot to death with machine guns, among which eight or nine people did not die and can testify. Tani said: I hope to find more evidence. The accused has nothing to do with it. Presiding Judge Shi continued to announce (3) On the evening of December 16, more than 5,000 refugees were escorted from the Overseas Chinese Reception Center to Zhongshan Wharf and shot with machine guns. The eyewitness Liang Tingfang was present to explain the experience of escaping death. Tani immediately asked which unit it was, but did not receive a reply. Bai Jingyu also claimed to be one of the survivors and came forward to testify. Presiding Judge Shi then questioned Tani whether he had read the Asahi Shimbun report when Nanjing was captured, which stated that two Japanese people competed to kill people, and as a result, one killed 104 people and the other killed 107 people. Tani said: This is the first time I have heard of this matter, and the accused is completely unaware of it.

Witnesses Appear in Court to Describe Atrocities

Then Chen Fubao, who testified at the Tokyo International Tribunal last year, appeared in court, stating: There are five points that can prove the enemy's atrocities: (1) On the morning of December 15, five Japanese soldiers drove us to Xinqiao, and 39 people were all shot to death and then pushed into the pond. I witnessed this with my own eyes. (2) On the evening of the 14th, a Japanese soldier took me to a residential area to search for property and saw a girl being gang-raped. (3) On the morning of the 16th, they used us as a game. If we were pushed down, they would laugh, and if we did not fall, they would stab us. (4) On the afternoon of the 16th, they forced us to lead them to Taiping Road, starting from the burning Global Hotel, and saw a Japanese soldier rape a pregnant woman, resulting in a miscarriage. (5) From January 5 to 8, there was another massacre, which seemed to be a premeditated plan. Tani immediately said: The area described by the witness has nothing to do with the accused's troops. Then Yin Youyu, a witness in the second case of the collective massacre, appeared to explain. Zhu Guangrong stated that when his son was killed, he saw that the troops were carrying items with the word "Tani" written on them. Tani said that the troops never carried flags or wrote words during combat. Zhu then said that he personally saw the Japanese rape four women in a shed, and then use bayonets to stab them in the chest and pull out their intestines and stomachs, which was extremely cruel. Tani said that there would never be women at the time. There were also Xiao Panshi, Lu Gaoshi, and others who told their husbands that their sons were killed. Tani denied all of this. At this point, Presiding Judge Shi declared: Tani's troops robbed Chen's family of 28 boxes of property in Baoding and Shijiazhuang, and forced women to provide physical comfort. Tani immediately denied it. At 4:00 PM, the presiding judge announced a break.

The Prosecutor's Words Were Passionate and Painful

The trial continued at 4:20 PM. The court announced that the investigation of the evidence was completed and began the debate. First, Prosecutor Chen Guangyu reported the details of the crimes such as arson, robbery, and rape, and stated that the Nanjing Massacre was a planned and entire act. The Japanese used their greatest strength to complete this unprecedented holocaust. All participating troops should be responsible, and the accused participated, so he should be responsible. At the same time, the accused's troops were the only troops in the city during the two days of the 13th and 14th, and the crimes were even more obvious. Finally, he said: The Chinese nation has always been broad-minded and does not seek revenge, but this hatred, even ten, a hundred, or ten thousand Tani Hisaos, cannot wash away the pain of such foreign humiliation. Please court sentence him to death. The entire audience applauded, and Tani's face turned red, and he was in a state of embarrassment and uneasiness.

Tani's Defense Was Full of Sophistry

Tani's defense was as follows: (1) The incident of forcing women to provide comfort in Baoding was completely untrue. (2) The incidents near the Zhonghua Gate are not correct and cannot be recognized. (3) The names of the victims and the types of victims are not detailed. It is not enough to say that it constitutes a criminal fact based only on the statements in court. There is no precedent for this in the world's trials. The year, the day, the place, and the specific facts must be presented. The Tokyo International Tribunal is still waiting for the American victim to testify about a prisoner being beaten, and the crime can only be determined after confrontation and multiple interrogations. He also said that the accused felt very sorry for this kind of unreasonable argument and hoped that the court would study it in detail and make a fair judgment after both Chinese and Japanese witnesses mentioned it. Then he explained a few points, thinking that the facts were not correct: (1) There were two days of fierce fighting in the Yuhuatai area near Zhonghua Gate. Matsui would command civilians to go to safe areas. The accused's troops were stationed in a no-man's land, so there was no killing. (2) The destruction of property in the North China Incident may have been caused by Japanese aircraft bombing and artillery fire, or by the destruction of Chinese plainclothes troops, and cannot be attributed to the accused's troops. (3) The accused's military discipline was strict, and he always instructed his subordinates, and there were no incidents. (4) The accused did not see or hear any of the alleged incidents, nor did he issue any orders or receive any reports from anyone. Finally, he said: The accused's troops had a total of 65 squadrons. Taking one subordinate into account, one squadron killed 15 people, one battalion killed 60 people, and 150 people were killed every day. There is no such large proportion. The accused's troops had a total of 15,000 people, and one-third of them departed in one week. Another third departed on the morning of the 18th. By the 21st, the accused's troops had already arrived in Wuhu. The Nanjing incident may have happened after the accused departed. The trial ended at 6:00 PM. The court announced that it would continue to hold a debate at a scheduled time, and the accused was taken back into custody.

### Sino-British Civil Aviation Agreement to be Discussed Next Week; British Transport Delegation Visited Our Authorities Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Our transportation authorities held their first meeting with the British Transport Delegation to China at 10:00 AM on the 8th to discuss the conclusion of a civil aviation agreement. The opinions of both sides were very close. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM and scheduled to meet again on the 12th for further discussion.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Lieutenant General Paul, head of the British Transport Delegation to China, and four members of the delegation paid a visit to Minister Yu on the morning of the 8th, and were received by Advisor Ling Shifen and Director Dai Anguo of the Civil Aviation Administration. The Sino-British Civil Aviation Agreement has not yet been formally discussed.

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] The British Transport Delegation and Chinese representatives Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei and Director of Civil Aviation Administration Dai Anguo held a preliminary meeting on the 8th to exchange views on the signing of a Sino-British aviation treaty, and scheduled the first formal meeting for next Wednesday (the 12th). At that time, the draft aviation treaty will be discussed by representatives of both sides. According to Dai, today's meeting did not mention the treaty itself, but only discussed the agenda of the next meeting. Both sides expressed their desire to conclude a reciprocal aviation treaty. Regarding the nature of this agreement, whether it is similar to the Sino-American aviation treaty, Dai refused to comment. Reporters also asked members of the British delegation when the treaty could be signed. It is said that it is too early to predict at this time. The Sino-American aviation treaty took four months to complete.

### Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship Talks Have Reached a Stalemate

Philippine Proposes New Draft Treaty Overturning Agreement

[Central News Agency, Manila, 7th] After the Philippine Foreign Ministry submitted a new draft of the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship to our embassy yesterday, the treaty negotiations reached a stalemate. This draft treaty is tantamount to overturning all the clauses that have been agreed upon in the months of negotiations between the two sides. Senior Philippine government officials, 48 hours ago, still expressed their deep belief that the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship could be signed in the shortest possible time, because what the two sides had negotiated and agreed upon was only a certain clause concerning the convenience that one contracting country would give to the nationals of the other country. Qualified sources here pointed out that the new draft treaty submitted by the Philippine government completely ignores the steps of the treaty, and the Chinese government will not accept this new draft treaty as the basis for continuing negotiations. Our embassy in the Philippines and the Philippine Foreign Ministry are both keeping silent about the possibility of resuming negotiations.

### Hao Yongde, the Main Culprit in the Wanbaoshan Incident, to be Publicly Tried in Mid-Month

[Our Changchun Dispatch] Hao Yongde, the main culprit in the Wanbaoshan Incident, which was the prelude to the September 18th Incident, will be publicly tried in mid-month, and a debt of national blood can be settled. The files handled in this case have been completely preserved to this day by a former staff member of the Changchun County Government and have now been handed over to the court for handling. It is learned that there are many valuable materials, including conspiracies and tricks of the Japanese invasion of Northeast China. There are many Japanese and Korean people involved in this case. The municipal government once ordered the police station to investigate the Japanese and Korean residents in Changchun, but found nothing. The main culprit, Hao Yongde, is nearly 60 years old and feels quite painful during his detention. According to Chief Prosecutor Sun Yingwu of the High Court, Hao's case is being prosecuted for banditry and should be in the category of reduced sentences. It is also learned that Ma Yuanbo, the former county magistrate of Changchun who accepted bribes in this case (two gold bracelets and 3,000 silver dollars), has white hair and is still alive, living in seclusion in a nearby county, chanting scriptures and praying to spend his remaining years. He was reported by someone, but under the amnesty order, the court stated that it would not prosecute him.

This is the result of the negotiations between Special Envoy Li Dijun and the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Before the war, the largest amount of remittances from Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies in one month was 2.5 million yuan.

### Legal Tender Falling from the Sky; 30 Million Yuan Picked Up by Villagers; List of Casualties of Plane Crash in Chongqing Released

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The Air Transport Team of the Air Force Headquarters, No. 217 (a C47 transport plane), flew from Xi'an to Chongqing on the 6th. Due to a mechanical failure, it crashed at noon near a highway 6 kilometers away from the Baishi Airport on the outskirts of Chongqing. The plane carried a total of 14 passengers, of whom 11 died and 3 were injured. The list has been found, including pilot Liang Guoguang, co-pilot Qian Wenwei, mechanic Zhang Shanyou, passengers Zhou Ji, Liu Shaowen, Liu Xing, She Jianguo, Zhou Nongpi and two family members, who all died on the spot. The on-board communicator Guo Weiyi, mechanic Xu Heng and another Zhou surnamed were injured. Another dead person has not yet been identified.

### Largest Project in the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River; Mila Mountain Gorge Dam; Planned Construction by the Gansu Provincial Water Conservancy Department

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th] For the fundamental work in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the Lanzhou Survey Team of the Water Conservancy Engineering Department plans to build a dam as high as 100 meters in the Mila Mountain Gorge, and to build a reservoir of 50 kilometers upstream of the gorge. Personnel have been sent to survey it. If this dam becomes a reality, its water storage capacity can supply the Yellow River flow for a month, which is the largest project in the upper reaches of the Yellow River.

### The Purchase of the Bai Madam's Cemetery; The Process of Concluding the Contract

Chen Shijun Talks About Having Paid the Price

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] A Shanghai newspaper published a dispatch from Chengdu with the title "Hu Zhongzhu Resigns from His Post and Quits the Party, Wanting to Recover Lost Land from Bai Chongxi, Because His Ancestral Tomb in Tongliang Was Occupied." A few newspapers in Chongqing and Chengdu also published similar news. In order to clarify the truth, the reporter specifically visited Minister Bai. Mr. Chongxun, the eldest brother of Bai, and Mr. Chen Shijun came out to see me. Chen was the representative who signed the land purchase contract that day. He described the process in detail. According to Chen, Bai's mother, Madam Ma, passed away in Tangxia Town, Tongliang, Sichuan in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945). The Bai family has traditionally followed Islam and does not believe in feng shui. Moreover, the teachings indicate that the burial must be done quickly and cannot be delayed for more than three days. Because the Bai family lived here and was enthusiastic about public welfare, the local people expressed their appreciation. With the introduction of Li Zairong, the town leader of that area, they purchased a vacant lot on the hillside north of the Copper Wall Highway in the town, called Laoyingyan, for burial nearby. After both parties agreed, a contract was signed. The buyer used the name of Bai Shensi Hall. Because Mr. Chongxun and others were overwhelmed with grief, they specifically asked me (Chen himself) and Tang Ji to represent them in signing the contract. The seller was represented by Hu Zhaoxu, the nephew of Hu Zhongzhu. 150,000 yuan in national currency was paid, and Hu Zhongzhu's local township head of Hebianchang, Hu, also came to the scene and signed the contract as proof. After the Bai family purchased the land, they applied to the Tongliang County Government for registration, and the county government publicly announced it in accordance with the law, and stamped the county seal on the contract to ensure credibility. In this situation, the Bai family did not occupy the land. Furthermore, the report stated that Hu Zhongzhu said at a reception for reporters that the land occupied by the Bai family was Huangjiapo [this place is located on the south side of Copper Wall Highway, that is, the location of the former Central Party Headquarters Demonstration Farm and the Women's Handicraft Cooperative of the Relief Committee], which is even more wrong, because Bai Madam's cemetery is in Laoyingyan, which is far away from Huangjiapo.

### The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Stops Aiding Jiangxi Province's Grain and Materials

Cai Mengjian Flew to Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Solutions

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 8th] The Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has stopped aiding Jiangxi Province's grain and materials, which is affecting the promotion of Jiangxi Province's relief work. The public office is now tightening up. According to foreign personnel from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration who inspected Jiangxi, Jiangxi currently has many relief works related to agriculture, such as agricultural fields, dike repairs, and road construction, which require a large amount of grain to complete the various projects. The sudden cessation of aid will have an infinite impact on all work and make this work fall short. Director Cai Mengjian flew to Shanghai on the 8th to negotiate relief affairs with the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

### Tianjin White Russian Spy

Sosnin Sentenced to Six Years in Prison

(3) To jointly petition the United States with other provincial assemblies to continue allocating work-relief materials to aid disaster victims. (4) The provincial governments of all provinces should determine that provincial education funds should account for 30% of the province's land tax and various tax revenues, and county education funds should account for 35%.

### Editorial: The Arrival of the British Transportation Delegation in China

The British Transportation Delegation, led by Lieutenant General Powell, arrived in Nanjing yesterday. According to a Central News Agency report, the delegation's mission is to discuss with the Chinese authorities the extension of British Overseas Airways Corporation's air routes to China and to negotiate and sign a Sino-British civil aviation agreement with our government. However, according to reports from Nanjing, the delegation's mission in China "is to negotiate with the Chinese government on future cooperation in transportation technology on behalf of the British government." Regardless of the delegation's mission, their long journey to China will undoubtedly promote transportation progress between China and Britain. Therefore, we express our welcome to the delegation's arrival in the capital. We regret that, according to reports, the delegation will only stay in China for a few days, a short time that may prevent them from gaining a thorough understanding of China's transportation situation.

First and foremost, we must point out that China's modern transportation industry owes much to British assistance. The telegraphs in Tianjin and Shanghai were founded by the British. The Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai), Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou), Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou), and Beining (Beijing-Shenyang) railways were also planned and built by the British. As for inland river and coastal navigation, the fact that they were developed by the British is widely known. At the time, the British may have had their own motives for establishing these modern transportation undertakings in China, but we cannot help but express our sincere gratitude to the far-sighted British entrepreneurs for providing China with its modern transportation industry. Now, domestic transportation has not yet recovered, and the Jinpu Railway, which runs north-south, has not yet been opened to traffic. This is a gift from the Communist Party, which has harmed the country, ruined the people, and created turmoil with armed rebellion. But how can we not feel ashamed towards those who initially built China's modern transportation?

Following the arrival of commercial delegations after the war, the arrival of the British Transportation Delegation in China indicates that our wartime ally is concerned about the post-war restoration of transportation in our country, which is naturally a gratifying thing. Relations between countries are not one-sided but mutual. The primary purpose of the British Transportation Delegation's visit to China is naturally for Britain's own interests, which goes without saying. If their visit is indeed to seek cooperation in transportation technology between China and Britain, it should be beneficial to China, whose transportation technology is relatively backward. However, considering the delegation's brief visit, we cannot help but wonder what benefits their visit can bring to China's post-war transportation construction.

Speaking of civil aviation, the recent series of civil aviation accidents in China have shaken public confidence in civil aviation to some extent. This is not surprising, but we cannot say that civil aviation has no future in China. On the contrary, the development of civil aviation in China is booming. China has signed a civil aviation agreement with the United States, allowing United Airlines and Northwest Airlines to fly to China, and China has also sent planes to test flights to the United States. It has also established a civil aviation agreement with France. If the mission of the British Transportation Delegation is to negotiate the signing of a Sino-British civil aviation agreement, there should be no problem. However, we are concerned that China's aviation industry is underdeveloped and its capacity to produce aviation gasoline is low. On the surface, civil aviation agreements are equal and mutually beneficial, but the actual benefits on both sides may not be equal, resulting in new unequal situations in practice. We hope that our government authorities can pay attention to this point.

As for how to promote civil aviation safety, the recent series of domestic and foreign civil aircraft accidents, with their painful experiences, have forced us to improve the technical equipment of civil aviation. According to news from Melbourne, Australia, the Air Transport Management Committee of the International Civil Aviation Organization has decided to set up a number of management stations in the South Pacific region, and Shanghai has been selected as one of them, which will strengthen civil aviation equipment and control to ensure civil aviation safety. In addition, the government's transportation authorities have also been trying to improve the technical equipment of civil aviation since the recent series of civil aviation accidents. With these two measures, we believe that China's civil aviation will have even greater development in the future.

Britain is advanced in civil aviation. Its overseas aviation business is concentrated in British Overseas Airways Corporation, whose routes cover five continents. Britain also has noteworthy developments in the aviation industry. We hope that the arrival of the British Transportation Delegation will not only lead to the establishment of an air transport agreement between China and Britain, but also to cooperation in civil aviation technology, so that our developing civil aviation can benefit from the experience and technical cooperation of advanced countries and further promote its development. Recalling the past contributions of the British to the development of China's modern transportation industry, we therefore have high hopes for the arrival of this transportation delegation.

### Youth Army Recruits Young People, Aiming to Stabilize Order in Recovered Areas; Training Focuses on Local Security

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] The 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Suzhou recently received an order from the Ministry of National Defense to recruit young refugees from northern Jiangsu and unemployed youth from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The deadline for recruiting a full infantry division is the end of February this year. The division has now set up reception stations in key areas along the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to take charge of the management. Our reporter, in order to understand the significance of this, visited Major General Fang Maozhi, Chief of Staff of the division, on the 7th. He was informed that the reason for recruiting these young people is that the recovered areas in northern Jiangsu are expanding, and there is an urgent need to allocate cadres to maintain local security. Therefore, the purpose is entirely to stabilize order in the recovered areas. In the future, when the recruitment is completed, the training will focus on various skills to cope with local security. Occasional education in specialized technical subjects will also be provided to meet the needs of the society in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu. In short, this recruitment is purely for cultivating national rejuvenation cadres.

### Unscrupulous Grain Merchants Drive Up Rice Prices; 50,000 Dan of Hoarded Rice Seized; Su County Government Has Already Implemented Sealing and Confiscation

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 8th] Rice prices in the county have soared recently, now approaching 90,000 yuan. There is clearly a human factor involved. The public is extremely anxious and beyond words. County Magistrate Shen Chenglong suddenly received a secret report that unscrupulous grain merchants in Mudu were hoarding large quantities of rice to drive up prices. He dispatched officials to conduct on-site investigations yesterday and found that several rice shops in the town each hoarded at least 5,000 dan of rice, and even the town chief Gu Gensheng was hoarding a huge amount. The total amount reached more than 50,000 dan. Shen was greatly shocked and issued a hand order to Meng Junping, the district chief of Mudu, on the 8th, ordering him to work with the police station and the grain distribution office to seal up all the rice stored in the major rice shops and by Gu Gensheng, and to submit the account books for review. This decisive action is like a head-on blow to the unscrupulous grain merchants.

### Why Not Demand Payment for Counterfeit Currency From the Enemy?

Our national economy is facing a critical period. Instead of demanding the debt owed by the enemy, we are abandoning it. This debt is the Chu currency and Lian currency under the enemy's protection... The government should collect them all and exchange them with Japan. Has the government collected them? Why not have Japan redeem them? To rescue the Chinese economy? Our victorious country's legal tender has the responsibility to be exchanged externally. Why should Japan enjoy the fortune of "leniency and exemption from investigation"? Who is the victorious country and who is the defeated country between me and Japan? This confuses many intellectuals, causing the enemy's Chu and Lian... currencies to be used as fuel. Is this how we interpret returning good for evil?

The enemy's Chu and Lian... currencies in the hands of the common people were all earned through real rice grains and sweat. To allow them to be invalidated and used as fuel is to allow the enemy to safely enjoy the benefits. The government's lenient policy is being generous with other people's resources. I am afraid that no basis for this can be found in the Old and New Testaments, the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, or the Three Principles of the People.

The government should collect Chu currency at a rate of 200 yuan per 1 yuan of legal tender and exchange it with Japan for cash to alleviate the urgent economic crisis in China. This business is not unreasonable, especially when the common people are facing starvation. The common people have no ability to cross the sea to seek redemption, nor do they have the right to negotiate with the enemy. The government has the responsibility to collect the redemption for the common people, but it seems to lack the ability. Please, government, show great compassion and make it convenient!

The Japanese government structure, except for the military, is exactly the same as before the war, and it is not as fragmented as Germany. Especially today's Japanese government is a government that fulfills its obligations to the victorious countries. If I present the counterfeit currency to him for redemption, he has no reason to refuse. Moreover, General MacArthur is stationed in Tokyo and will definitely assist my legitimate and justifiable demands. If my government willingly gives up and refuses to redeem it, Japan will naturally not come to China's door to pay this debt.

Or someone might say: "Japan's compensation for losses is in progress." This cannot be compared. Compensation for losses is a special obligation that the defeated country should bear and refers to the valuation of objects, which can be more or less. Counterfeit currency has a fixed amount, and the face value is fixed. Whether it is paid out or received is a commercial act, and there are international practices. The nature is different, so there is no need to make a fuss. Invoking the prestige of the victorious country, please consider it, government. Is it easier to hold Japan accountable for redemption? (Li Bingwei)

### Jingyuan Village Needs to Improve Sanitation

### US Supports UN Organizations, Strongly Advocates Universal Military Training as Diplomatic Backup, Secretary of State Marshall Elaborates Policy

[US News Agency Washington 7th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall stated at his first press conference today that he will follow the policies adopted by President Truman and former Secretary of State Byrnes to maintain strong US support for the United Nations and actively participate with all his might in drafting peace agreements.

Marshall, addressing over one hundred journalists, reiterated the US government's full support for the position taken by US Representative Austin on the disarmament issue at the Security Council on February 4. Marshall spoke for over thirty minutes before answering questions from reporters. The State Department revealed some of Marshall's statements as follows:

The policy of the President and Byrnes, and therefore my policy, is to do our utmost to accelerate and perfect the United Nations as a tool for discussing international issues and maintaining international peace, so as to extend our country's influence into international affairs. In addition, we will actively participate with all our might in drafting peace agreements, which will become the permanent foundation for the United Nations to fulfill its mission.

Senator Austin's statement on the disarmament issue at the Security Council on February 4, as he said, represents the thoroughly considered opinion of the US government. The goal we are pursuing is peace, with collective security as a reliable foundation. The US government will cooperate with other countries to achieve this goal as soon as possible. I believe this is the first step on the road to disarmament, and this road is neither short nor convenient.

International control of atomic energy and its effective safeguards are of utmost importance. In the general sense, this is not a question of military reduction. Once this extremely destructive force is not controlled, it will be difficult for mankind to feel safe for even a day. This is why we attach the utmost importance to solving this problem. Reaching solutions to all major peace issues that are acceptable to all major powers is also necessary to establish true security. Before finding these solutions, it is difficult to hope for any true disarmament, or even any actual reduction in armaments. I firmly believe that the US government will carefully avoid repeating the tragedy of unilateral disarmament and arms limitation after 1921. The issue of disarmament cannot be resolved emotionally. Today, we should resolve it through practical means.

Marshall also strongly emphasized that the United States will never reduce its military strength until a collective security system is established, and that universal military training must be implemented to support US foreign policy.

### Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, US Delegation Members, Murphy and Clay Will Accompany

Regarding the selection of US representatives to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Marshall stated that the selection of my entourage will be very similar to the selection of Secretary of State Byrnes' entourage at the New York and Paris Foreign Ministers' Conferences. In other words, it can be said that I will be accompanied by the same team. I hope that my deputy will be Mr. Murphy, and General Clay is also expected to become an advisor to the US delegation. Senators Vandenberg and Connally have declared their positions and have consulted with me for a long time beforehand. I thoroughly understand their positions and fully listen to their support for the general points of bipartisan foreign policy. The Soviet Embassy has formally notified us that the number of journalists to be received by the Soviet side will be limited to fifteen to twenty. We are now requesting the Soviet government to increase this number. We are also trying to obtain broadcast equipment for journalists. I previously discussed this issue with Molotov, and Ambassador Smith previously expressed his views on the issue of allowing broadcasting. A total of seventy-three journalists have applied to go to Moscow, but since there is a selection issue, the State Department cannot select all applicants.

Palestinian Situation, US Expresses Deep Concern

Regarding the Palestine issue, Marshall said that the United States is fully familiar with the various discussions in London, and the US government only hopes that all parties will reach a unanimous solution. The United States is extremely concerned about the situation in Palestine. Marshall also said that he does not believe that the British side has any plans to adopt a tough military strategy in Palestine.

Trusteeship of Former Japanese Mandated Islands, Plan Unchanged

Regarding the Pacific trust territory islands, Marshall mentioned President Truman's statement on November 6 last year, which stated that the United States would formally submit to the Security Council as soon as possible a draft strategic trusteeship agreement regarding the former Japanese mandated islands. Marshall said that US Representative Austin is expected to deliver this agreement to the Security Council around February 17. Marshall continued to say that although the governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia have made suggestions, all parties do not oppose this proposal by the United States. The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia all believe that this issue should be left for discussion after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. Marshall said that the US government believes that this matter should not be delayed, but if the Security Council decides to extend the discussion on this matter after the US proposal is formally submitted, the US government is still willing to consider extending the discussion on this matter. Marshall pointed out that the US proposal for strategic trusteeship of these Pacific trust territory islands is fully in line with the trusteeship provisions of the United Nations Charter. According to the Charter, the trusteeship agreement should be submitted to the Security Council rather than to the United Nations General Assembly because the islands are strategic areas.

Dissatisfaction with Polish Election, Retains Freedom of Action

Marshall continued to say that my government's position on the recent Polish elections has been fully clarified in the statement issued by the State Department on January 28. My government intends to continue to closely monitor the situation in Poland. My government is extremely concerned about the welfare of the Polish people and will retain the freedom of action to determine its future attitude towards the Polish government and will continue to obtain information on all developments in Poland from the diplomatic mission in Warsaw. "To this end, the US Ambassador to Poland is expected to return home in the near future to consult with the State Department so that the State Department can receive a preliminary report on recent developments."

### Differences Between US and Soviet Views, Disarmament Subcommittee Meeting Fails

[Associated Press New York 7th Dispatch] The Security Council's six-nation subcommittee discussed the organizational rules of the Zhulai Military Commission. Due to the differences between the US and Soviet views, which could not be reconciled, it has been abandoned today. After three days of secret discussions, the representatives believed that continued efforts would be of no avail, and finally decided to return two draft proposals to the Security Council for handling, one including the Soviet view and the other the US position. The subcommittee believes that the dispute between the two sides is clearly a matter of principle and therefore cannot be compromised. The Security Council will re-discuss this matter at a public meeting around next Wednesday.

Pan-American Defense

Regarding Latin America, Marshall said that the long-delayed Rio de Janeiro conference will be convened immediately to study the Western Hemisphere defense plan with the Latin American countries. The United States has not changed its attitude towards the Argentine government and still requires the Perón government to eliminate the Nazis.

US-Philippine Negotiations

Regarding the issue of US bases in the Philippines, the Secretary of State said that he has received reports that the relevant discussions are continuing in a friendly spirit and that there are no particular difficulties.

Regarding the joint statement of Senators Vandenberg and Millikin regarding the Commercial Act, Marshall said that the statement shows that Congress has cooperated with the State Department and that economic affairs, like world political affairs, have also achieved bipartisan cooperation.

Italy Prepares to Stop Work to Commemorate National Humiliation

[Associated Press Paris 7th Dispatch] The peace treaty for the five defeated countries is scheduled to be signed here on the 10th. A Yugoslav spokesman reiterated today that the country intends to refuse to sign. At the same time, the General Confederation of Labor in Rome called on the entire country to stop work for ten minutes at 11:00 AM on the 10th, the hour of signing the peace treaty with Italy, to commemorate national humiliation.

### Deep Friction Between US and Soviet Union, Pessimistic About Foreign Ministers' Conference, Soviet Union May Make Astonishing Proposals on German Issue

[Associated Press Washington 7th Dispatch] The Moscow Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to be held next month, but before the conference opens, there are many difficulties between the United States and the Soviet Union, which are increasing rather than decreasing. Secretary of State Marshall is studying the various issues to be discussed at the Moscow conference, and the accumulating differences between the two countries will have a great impact on the trend of the conference. The following facts are sufficient to hinder the feelings between the two countries: (1) The United States has sent a note to the Soviet Union requesting negotiations on the final settlement of materials borrowed under the Lend-Lease Act, but the Soviet Union has ignored it. (2) The US government requested that it take concerted action with the UK and the Soviet Union to enable Poland to hold free elections, but the Soviet Union has refused. The United States believes that the Soviet Union's move violates the Potsdam Agreement, and Marshall may raise this issue at the Moscow conference. (3) The United States sent a note to the Soviet Union urging it to consult with China on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Dalian and return civil administration to China, but the Soviet Union ignored it. (4) According to reports from Washington, the United States requested to send well-known professors and others with cultural missions to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union often ignored them. The United States eagerly invited Soviet personnel to the United States, but the Soviet Union responded with indifference. (5) Many American people suffered war damage in Eastern Europe. The State Department wants to obtain reports on personal and property aspects, but the Soviet authorities remain silent. In addition to the above-mentioned special stimuli, conflicts continue to occur between the Soviet Union and the Western powers in the United Nations organizations and in every region where British and American leaders want to stop Soviet expansion, such as Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and the Spitsbergen Islands. Some diplomats believe that the Soviet strategy may be to put forward astonishing proposals at the beginning of the Moscow conference, which may have the greatest propaganda effect on the German people. The Soviet Union will instigate the construction of a centralized and powerful German government, while the United States wants Germany to adopt a federal system, making the power of the central government weaker. This point has been almost determined. The Soviet Union may even put forward a request, advocating that the four powers withdraw from Germany uniformly and return it to the Germans as soon as possible. Although there is currently no such evidence, American policymakers will never ignore its possibility.

### The Former Japanese Mandated Islands are Managed by the United States

I Principally Express Support

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 8th Dispatch] Regarding the disposition of the Japanese mandated territories, since the US side announced its intention to submit it to the Security Council and designate it as a military trust territory managed by the United States, it has aroused discussions among the United Nations. Some have argued that this matter must be resolved in the peace conference with Japan. The reporter inquired with the Chinese government and learned that the Chinese government has now received the US draft, and the Chinese government will principally agree with the trusteeship method proposed by the US side. As to whether this matter should be resolved at the same time as the Japanese and other territorial issues at the peace conference with Japan, it is only a matter of procedure and is not very important. In addition, regarding the future peace conference with Japan, China will advocate that the venue should be selected within the Pacific coastal countries region.

[Central News Agency New York 7th Special Telegram] According to the New York Herald Tribune: Although the United Kingdom does not oppose but rather supports the US request to make the former Japanese mandated islands a "strategic" trust territory, it requests that the "open door" principle, which the United States often advocates, be applied to the above-mentioned islands. The UK has submitted a note to the US Department of State, arguing that any laws and regulations that the United States intends to formulate for the above-mentioned islands should be discussed in the negotiations on the peace with Japan before taking action.

### The Helgoland Fortress in the North Sea Will Be Completely Destroyed by Bombing

[Reuters Hamburg 7th Dispatch] Heligoland Island in the North Sea, which was used by the German army as a strong naval base in the two world wars, has been planted with 6,700 tons of explosives to completely destroy its fortress equipment. The explosives are buried within the 18-mile land angle of the island and are tentatively scheduled to explode on March 31. British warships will be berthed at least eight miles from the island to detonate the explosives with electric wires. The residents of the island, which is 30 miles from the German coast, have already been evacuated. The four seaports of the island can be used as fishing ports and will not be destroyed by bombing.

### Greek Left and Right Wings Demonstrate, Investigation Team Decides to Maintain an Impartial Position

[Reuters Athens 7th Dispatch] Thousands of Greek left-wing elements demonstrated in front of the office of the United Nations investigation team today, demanding that British troops withdraw from Greece, that the death sentences be not carried out, and that fleeing political prisoners be allowed to return to the country. The investigation team was holding a secret meeting at the time. Colonel Longte, the secretary-general of the team, appeared on the balcony and assured that the team would soon listen to the opinions of the representatives of the Greek left-wing group Liberation Front. The crowd cheered and dispersed. Afterwards, right-wing elements held a counter-demonstration, chanting slogans such as "Long live the King." The police did not interfere with either demonstration, only preventing clashes between the two factions.

### England's National Coal Shortage is Severe; Power Outages Severely Impact National Economy; Severe European Winter is the Main Cause of Coal Shortage

[Reuters, London, 8th] Fuel Minister Shinwell announced in Parliament yesterday: Due to fuel shortages, all industries in London, southeastern England, central England, and northeastern England will have their electricity supply cut off starting Monday.

[Associated Press, London, 7th] The British government announced today that it would conserve electricity, which was expected due to the coal shortage. The government ordered all factories in industrial areas across the country to implement power saving measures starting from the 10th of this month. A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said that industrial stagnation would lead to the unemployment of four million workers, while millions of households would also be affected, with household electricity consumption reduced to five hours per day. The spokesperson also said that the economic chaos in the future could be comparable to the shortage of gas ten years ago. Conservative newspapers hinted that the Labour government would be forced to form a coalition government to resolve the crisis. Labour figures dismissed this as "Conservative wishful thinking." Fuel and Electricity Minister Shinwell faced questioning from both Labour and Conservative members of Parliament when he announced the above drastic measures in the House of Commons today. Shinwell said that the government had decided to stop supplying industrial electricity to London and the southeast, northwest, and central regions starting from the 10th, and household users would be prohibited from using electricity from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Shinwell hoped that the blackout would not last for three or four days, at most a week. The day the power saving order was issued, London experienced a severe cold that had not been seen for many years, and most residents relied on electricity for heating. The cold wave had lasted for a month, and the suffering was the worst in ten years. Currently, the ground is covered with snow, and the temperature is below freezing. The areas Shinwell pointed out for power outages, such as London, Birmingham, and Manchester, are all the most thriving industrial areas in Britain. A Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said: "British production has been wiped out." The spokesperson predicted that all cotton mills and automobile factories would be shut down. The machine industry is likely to come to a complete standstill. Half of the rayon industry and electricity-using industries will also be shut down. Hundreds of ocean liners are also blocked in ports due to high costs, export bans, and coal loading bans. This ban applies to both domestic and foreign ships, and it is estimated that no less than 700 ships are affected.

### British King Sails in Ship, Approaching the Equator

[Associated Press, London, 7th] Princess Elizabeth and Princess Rose of Britain are traveling with their father and mother on the battleship "Vanguard" on a tour of South Africa and will cross the equator on the 10th of this month. According to custom, those who cross the equator for the first time must have their heads washed and bathe in cold water, but the two princesses, with their royal status, may not be bound by custom. According to a telegram from the "Vanguard," the ship has traveled 2,000 miles, and the two princesses will participate in the ship's immersion ceremony with others, but they will not enter the water.

This year, Europe and the United States are experiencing severe cold weather. The illustration shows the bleak scene in the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, where a black goose in the pond is about to be frozen in the ice.

### Telegram Exchanges Between Britain and the Soviet Union; Exchanging Opinions on the Alliance

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] Marshal Stalin and British Foreign Secretary Bevin have been exchanging telegrams recently. According to government officials, the opinions they exchanged are related to the British-Soviet alliance. Furthermore, with the opening of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow imminent, Foreign Secretary Bevin is about to depart for Moscow. When Bevin meets with Marshal Stalin, this exchange of views can be seen as a prelude to their meeting, with the common goal of making the British-Soviet alliance suitable for the current environment.

### The Palestine Problem: Britain Proposes a Compromise Plan; Arabs and Jews Hold Conflicting Views

[Associated Press, London, 7th] The British government has today presented a compromise plan for resolving the Palestine problem to Arab leaders. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Arab representative, Mr. Gululai, stated that if this proposal allows even one more Jew to enter Palestine, it would be tantamount to declaring war. The compromise plan appears to have been submitted to the Jewish delegation on the same day. According to Mr. Hesseni, head of the Arab delegation, the country has decided not to read the contents of the proposal until tomorrow morning because "I am sure that reading it will keep me up all night." Mr. Hesseni's remarks suggest that he has heard that the new proposal still advocates the immediate transfer of 100,000 Jews from European refugee camps to the Palestinian Jewish area. At the same time, British Colonial Secretary Jones convened an ad hoc meeting tonight with Mr. Hiddock, head of the Political Department of the Jewish Congress, to discuss the situation in Palestine. It is reported that Jones warned Hiddock that if serious riots occur again in Palestine after the British proposal is announced, the British army will take the initiative. The compromise proposal was submitted to the Cabinet by Jones, advocating allowing Jews to immigrate to Palestine without any limit on the number. Foreign Secretary Bevin, on the other hand, believes that unlimited immigration of Jews would provoke an anti-British "holy war" among the Arabs.

[Reuters, London, 8th] Although Jewish and Arab representatives are scheduled to hold separate meetings today to discuss the British government's new plan for Palestine, it is expected that neither group will accept it. Iraqi Foreign Minister Jamali, a spokesperson for the Arab delegation, reiterated that the Arabs will never accept any plan that allows Jews to immigrate or assigns part of Palestinian land to Jewish rule, while the Jewish Association expressed dissatisfaction for not obtaining a suitable area of land to establish a Jewish state.

### Americans Look at the Soviet Union

— Special Translation by this Newspaper's Translation Department

The Soviet government, the Soviet state, and the Soviet people are three distinct things that should be distinguished. Americans should be hostile to the Soviet government at present, neutral toward the Soviet state, but the Soviet people should be friends of America.

American goodwill toward the Soviet Union reached its peak in 1945, but has gradually declined since then: this is what American public opinion polls tell us. The results of the 1946 public opinion polls showed that 62 percent of Americans admitted that their feelings toward the Soviet Union were not as friendly as they had been a year before.

Americans' Goodwill Towards the Soviet Union Decreases

During this year, the Soviet Union restricted political freedom in Eastern Europe, incited riots in Yizhou, plundered materials from the nine northeastern provinces of China, and delivered lengthy and abusive speeches in Paris. Therefore, it is not surprising that American goodwill toward the Soviet Union has decreased. This can be regarded as progress in Americans' understanding of world affairs, but this progress is not very long, and if it is allowed to stay there, it may turn into regression. Because it is very naive to confuse the country and the people in this way and arbitrarily divide them into friendly and unfriendly. Each country has its own characteristics, just like the personality of a person, but it is not that simple. To correct the distortion of American public opinion about the Soviet Union, we must understand what we like and dislike about the Soviet Union, what we are worried about, and what we hope for?

We should distinguish between three important things: the Soviet government, the Soviet state, and the Soviet people. Americans should be hostile to the Soviet government at present, neutral toward the Soviet state, but the Soviet people should be friends of America.

Soviet Policy Hinders Friendship

The autocratic politics of the Soviet government are more extensive than those of the Russian era. The political system of other countries is not our business, but we, as the American people, can curse the methods and principles adopted by this government. Two Soviet policies have repeatedly hindered the development of genuine peace between the United States and the Soviet Union. The first is communism's salvation of the world, which has unnecessarily strengthened the conflict between our national ideas and those of the Soviet Union. The second is the isolationism of the Communist Party, which has put an iron curtain between the Soviet and American nations.

Since 1939, the Soviet Union has annexed 274,000 square miles of land in Europe and Asia, and has brought eight independent countries into its sphere of influence. Almost all of these annexed lands were owned by Russia before 1918, and most of the new sphere of influence countries were controlled or coveted by the Russian emperors of the past. This is not only the expansion of the Soviet Union itself, but also a salvational dream, which its prophet Lenin made most clear. He wants to overthrow capitalism all over the world. Who declared this "sacred" war? Not the Soviet Union, but a few fanatical politicians. The Soviet Union is their tool, just as foreign Communist parties are tools of the Soviet Union. In order to safeguard human freedom, the United States has to resist the spread of communism, so we have to resist the Soviet Union.

Censorship Becomes Even More Serious

But what is worse is the Soviet government's policy of isolating its people. The current Soviet censorship system is even more serious than during the war, which is not what the Soviet people think. Although the Soviet people frankly envy the wealth of the United States, they can be proud of their achievements in working hard for 25 years. Their natural feelings for the United States are a friendly and unfulfilled curiosity. When Ehrenburg gave a speech in Moscow last month about his impressions of his trip to the United States, the audience was packed and listened attentively for two hours.

The Russian People Have Many Virtues

Throughout history, the patriotism of the Russian people has been stirred to its climax by a vague ideal. This is tantamount to drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. Occasionally, when the economic situation improves a little, like the period of booming consumer goods from 1933 to 1936, the Soviet people happily ate that "cake." They have always dreamed of the era of harmony during the war: more houses, more "culture" - cultural bathrooms, cultural fountain pens, cultural ice cream, these are the things the Soviet people need.

But in order to enrich and supply the new prisoners in the concentration camps, the consumer goods industry had to stagnate again. However, the Soviet people love freedom and love their compatriots with a passion that is almost unparalleled by the people of other countries. They gather together at every turn, but they do not act barbarously; although they are poor, they are not beggars. They are unfortunately victims of a certain system, and their only weapon to deal with this system is patience and benevolence. They want us to trust them. I hope we will not answer their expectations with anger or ridicule again. (Abridged translation from the American magazine "Life")

### Burmese Anti-British Faction Organizes United Front

[Report from this newspaper] London broadcast on the day.

### Japanese Youth Attempts to Assassinate Yoshida

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 8th] The Japanese police recently arrested a young thief named Kawakawa, 25 years old. According to his confession, he had conspired to assassinate Prime Minister Yoshida, and there were ten accomplices, three of whom were residents of Tokyo.

### The Japanese Political Situation is Unstable; Calls for a Coalition Cabinet Rise Again; MacArthur's Order

[Gaizo-sha, Tokyo, 8th] At the end of last month, when 8.6 million Japanese people were brewing a general strike, the Yoshida Cabinet was in danger. MacArthur's order prohibiting the strike brought it back to life. After Yoshida received a strong shot in the arm, he immediately implemented a partial cabinet reshuffle. However, because the reshuffle still did not have the certainty of overcoming the labor offensive and the economic crisis, he still revealed his intention to organize a coalition cabinet and seized the opportunity to win over the Socialist Party to join the cabinet. Over the past week, the Progressive Party has been extremely dissatisfied with the reshuffled cabinet and has actively appealed to the Liberal and Socialist parties to organize a coalition cabinet. However, because the Liberal Party's attitude was negative and the Socialist Party's attitude was cautious, the second and third leaders' meetings ultimately failed to materialize, and the political situation remained unstable. The date for the resumption of parliament is approaching. Just as Yoshida was at a loss, MacArthur sent a letter to Yoshida, instructing him to hold a general election after completing his mission in the Diet. Yoshida also received strong support for this, because the Diet still needs three months to complete its mission, and he has at least obtained a guarantee to extend the life of the cabinet for three months. Within these three months, Yoshida will carefully arrange the conservative camp and strengthen the unity between the Liberal and Progressive parties in order to compete with the powerful Socialist Party in the general election.

However, the undercurrents in the Japanese political situation are still extremely complex at this moment. The Liberal Party decided yesterday to abandon the work of organizing a "coalition cabinet," but the Progressive Party today still insisted on establishing a "national salvation regime," the ultimate goal of which is to unite all factions and expel Yoshida. At the same time, the movement within the Liberal Party to expel Yoshida as president has also emerged, which is quite noteworthy. Although Yoshida has abandoned the idea of organizing a coalition cabinet, the cabinet will be in extreme danger if the Progressive Party's work is successful.

### "Four Famous Mountains" Bandit Gang Comes to Shanghai; Stealing Important People's Property Repeatedly; Impersonating Air Force Officers

The Chongqing US Dollar Market Theft Case is Finally Revealed Today

[Report from this newspaper] During the Anti-Japanese War, the "Four Famous Mountains" bandit gang, which ran rampant in southwestern China, stole 30,000 US dollars in American dollar bills from Song Ziwen, the President of the Executive Yuan, in the US dollar market on Shaanxi Street in Chongqing in the spring of the 30th year. Although the military and police authorities in Chongqing conducted a thorough investigation afterward, they were eventually missed due to their exceptional cunning. After the victory, Liu Nanzhu, the "Chief of Staff" of the "Four Famous Mountains," under the pseudonym Zhang Xi, also known as Liu Hangxia, actually transformed himself into an Air Force officer and operated on the Beijing-Shanghai line, committing many crimes one after another. Among them, the most outstanding ones were: one was Ms. Shen Dianzhong, who lived at 598 Weihaiwei Road in this city, and was stolen 3 million legal tender, gold jewelry, and land deeds. Ms. Shen is the daughter of Shen Yixueyi, secretary of a certain agency in Nanshi. The other was that recently, when Zhang Dongshen, the Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, went to Beijing from Shanghai, he had a suitcase containing "Opinions on the Current Situation" to be presented to the Chairman, which was stolen in the crowd at the ticket office of the North Station, causing Zhang to postpone his trip temporarily and issue a statement. Unexpectedly, this large-scale theft was finally captured by the Railway Bureau Police Department at 8:20 PM on the 30th of last month in the third-class carriage of the Beijing-Shanghai Tenth Express. At the same time, another "Four Famous Mountains" bandit, the mute Zhang Zhiqing, and his assistant Liu Huaide, were also arrested in Vienna Dance Hall and other places. A large number of forged Air Force documents, travel permits, and fake Victory Medals were seized one after another. After interrogation, they have confessed to the crimes and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for questioning tomorrow.

Stealing in the Carriage, Arrested After Being Discovered

As for the process of solving the case, it was due to the fact that at 8:20 PM on January 30th this year, a passenger named Yang Jingwei in the third-class carriage of the tenth express had his cotton robe cut with a blade. It was discovered that the young military officer standing next to him was highly suspected, and there was also proof from a third party, Chen Shaoquan. Therefore, the on-duty police officer No. 984 took the case. After questioning by Xu Ying, the director of the Eighth Sub-precinct, the defendant claimed to be Liu Hangxia, 211 years old, from Beiping, and currently a flight staff officer of the First Brigade of the Fifth Military Region of the Air Force, transferred from India to Taipei. The suspect was fully equipped with an American Air Force uniform, wearing a flight badge, Victory Medal, wrist strap, and other items, and presented a set of Air Force travel permits. The report was made with the character Si No. 5, and transferred to the section on January 31. After the person in charge of the case interrogated him strictly according to the law, the defendant was evasive. Because his words were hesitant and there was no room for argument, he finally admitted that he had been picking pockets for a living, and had traveled from the inland to Shen. On December 10, 35, he formed a group with accomplices Liu Huaide, Zhang Zhiqing, and Luo Tiexiong, Liu Jinshan, and Xiao Luo (etc.) impersonating Air Force officers, opening rooms at the Royal Hotel No. 216 Wujin Road, the New World Hotel No. 257 Nanjing Road, and the Dashing Hotel No. 313 Zhejiang Road in this city, hiding and sharing the loot, and distributing his accomplices in the four major companies of Longhua Airport in this city and on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line to perform their skills in picking pockets. Dozens of cases have been committed one after another.

Mute Dancer is Actually an Accomplice

The Police Department, together with the Old Zhabei and New Cheng District Bureaus, captured one of his accomplices, Zhang Zhiqing (the suspect is mute, so interrogation is very difficult) in the Vienna Dance Hall on January 31st and February 1st. A wrist strap was also found, and he confessed that he was indeed a thief. Another suspect, Liu Huaide, was found in room 313 of the Dashing Hotel on Zhejiang Road, and 20 blank travel permits with the Air Force seal, as well as Air Force epaulettes and collar badges, were found. He confessed that he and the first defendant, Liu Hangxia, were accomplices in picking pockets.

Going East Along the Current, Stealing All the Way

According to Liu's confession, during the Anti-Japanese War, he and his accomplices Li Benchu and Hu Fei stole 30,000 US dollars from the US dollar market on Shaanxi Street in Chongqing. He received 8,000 yuan. Because the circumstances of the case were serious, the security organs in Chongqing attached great importance to it and strictly arrested the pickpockets. Seeing the urgency, he could not stand in Chongqing and secretly took the Minben wheel of the Minsheng Company to Wanxian, and then transferred to Guiyang, Kunming, Chengdu and other places, still stealing while moving. After the victory, he stole all the way east along the various ports. He arrived in Shanghai on December 10 last year, first living in the Royal Hotel, then moving to the New World Hotel. More than a month later, he moved to the Dashing Hotel again. This time, he was arrested for working with Luo Tiexiong (i.e., Da Luo) to steal at the station and on the train.

Thieves are Also Romantic and Like Women

The main culprit Liu Hangxia, who was arrested this time, was young and romantic. Two photos were copied, one of a popular dancer, Xuezhen, from the Da Shanghai Dance Hall in this city, and the other was given by the singer Lu Ping. According to Liu's confession, whenever they went to a place, they would first form relationships with local dancers, singers, female students, and even female celebrities. There were hundreds of people who had physical relationships with him. The other three members of the "Four Famous Mountains" were also like this, and all the money they had stolen over the years was spent on women.

Also, all the stolen goods seized this time have been listed on the list, including a blade, a set of American Air Force uniforms, two fake flight badges, one fake Victory Medal, one fake Air Force travel permit, twenty forged Air Force travel permits, two fake Air Force collar badges, one epaulette, one paper of "Notes for Returnees Staying in Shanghai," and 50 cards printed with "Liu Hangxia, Staff Officer of the Third Squadron of the First Brigade of the Fifth Military Region of the Air Force," one Royal Hotel bill, and one forged Air Force Flight Staff Officer Liu Hangxia travel permit (the above is Liu Hangxia's part). There are also two silver wrist straps, a notebook, a piece of stationery with the seal of the Political Department of the 75th Army, and a travel permit from the 75th Army.

### Five-Person Investigation Committee Continues to Visit Fire Department; Observation Tower Staff Lament Miserable Situation; Whole Body in Tatters, Empty Stomach

[Report from this newspaper] Ke Xin, chairman of the five-person investigation committee for the Seymour Road fire, Zhang Da, and others, continued to visit the fire department at 2 PM yesterday and compared the official fire department in the city center with the private fire department in Nanshi. Those who appeared at the Yichang Road Fire Department were still wearing rotten raincoats and broken leather boots. When the firefighters saw reporters, they were mostly full of complaints. They said, "For several years, all they have is a tattered uniform. When they return from fighting a fire, they are soaked all over, but they have no way to change their clothes. The old French Concession's water equipment has long been abandoned, so they are both frozen and hungry, and their suffering is incomparable." They also handed Director Ke a letter, asking him to forward it to the City Council for appeal. Old firefighter No. 446 also said: For the past fifteen years, he has been sitting high on the observation tower for six hours every night, inspecting the surrounding fires so that he can inform the control room at any time and give rescue measures quickly. His mission is indeed very sacred, but what he gets in return is a body in tatters and an empty stomach.

Female Flow Goes to the Fire Site, Team Captain Zhuo Denies

In addition to hosting the Investigation Committee's visit to the New Police Training Center's performance, Team Captain Zhuo Houdao refuted the "Fire Department Lady" section published in various newspapers a few days ago. He said: "The speed of the fire truck is so fast that even new fire police officers cannot stand firm, let alone women. And the temperature that day was below zero, and it was raining heavily. What is the purpose of a woman taking a fire truck to the fire site?" The team captain also said: "Since the Seymour Road incident, all walks of life have severely criticized the firefighters. It can be said that they are covered in wounds. However, although there are one or two unscrupulous people among the firefighters, not everyone is like this. Therefore, those who know how to protect themselves are expressing their weariness." Ke Xin, chairman of the Investigation Committee, realized the seriousness of the situation and specifically stated that when the investigation of the Seymour Road fire case comes to an end, he intends to ask the mayor to summon all the firefighters for a speech to encourage them and improve their morale.

### Nanshi Fire Brigade - Member Obligations

The special committee and others have visited various fire stations in the Nanshi area. The Nanshi fire stations are privately operated and divided into six districts: Southeast, Northwest, Central, and Dongjiadu. During the Anti-Japanese War, the East district was demolished by the enemy, the South district was bombed, and the West district was partially preserved due to its relocation to the former French Concession. Only the Central and North districts remained unscathed because they were included in the refugee zone. The Nanshi Fire Brigade was founded in the 30th year of the Guangxu era (1904), and its funding relies entirely on donations from merchants and residents, but it is not mandatory. Currently, the Nanshi Fire Brigade has a small number of personnel, including 14 firefighters and 10 staff members, while volunteer members account for as many as 80. The salaries of the firefighters are not high, ranging from 110,000 to 200,000, but most of the members are semi-volunteer, so they have no complaints. Moreover, when the alarm bell rings, volunteer members immediately prepare upon hearing the sound to continue the dispatch. The destroyed East District Fire Brigade is actively being repaired, and once the reorganization is complete, various sectors will be invited to visit.

### Because There Are Too Many Bureaucratic Processes, Firefighting Is Also Affected; Whether Government-Run or Private, Money Is Key

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ge Kexin, the director of the Fire Investigation Committee, inquired about the advantages and disadvantages of government-run versus private fire stations when he visited the Nanshi private fire station yesterday. Mao Jing, the standing committee member of the Shanghai Hunan District Fire Brigade Federation, replied, "If there is money, both government-run and private are good. Without money, neither the government nor private can do well." Hua Nianzhu, the captain of the district team, also humorously replied, "Private operations can save a lot of paperwork," implying criticism of the government's excessive bureaucracy. Mao also reported that when Wu Tiecheng was the Mayor of Shanghai, he suggested unifying the Nanshi fire stations and having the government bear the expenses. Mao opposed this at the time because the procedures for receiving funds were too cumbersome. Mao also said, "The problem of 'waiting for approvals'" has been the same since ancient times and is even more severe today. Therefore, reforms must be implemented to save manpower and resources. They did not want to make any specific criticisms of government-run fire stations, but they only suggested that more volunteer members should be hired, which could serve as a general model and improve work efficiency. Zhou Zhaoxiang, the director of the fire station, also felt a headache about the current cumbersome official procedures. He told the reporter that even buying a single screw requires submitting a written request, then investigating, estimating the price, stamping seals, and going through numerous approvals, which takes at least half a month. Therefore, Director Zhou will raise this issue in the City Council, requesting an additional several million yuan in revolving funds for operations.

### Excavation of the Fire Site to Be Completed Tomorrow

All the excavated items have been handed over to Miss Wang Yunfu and Wang Chuiling. The excavation of the fire site will continue today and is scheduled to be completed tomorrow.

### Civil Aviation Administration Releases Report on Christmas Three-Plane Accident; Severe Weather Deterioration Was the Main Cause of the Accidents; Personnel Deemed to Have Done Their Utmost

The Ministry of Communications' Civil Aviation Administration recently released a report on the plane crashes of Central China Airlines and China National Aviation Corporation on December 25th last year. The full text is over 5,000 words long, detailing the accidents of Central Company's No. 48 aircraft and China Company's No. 140 and No. 115 aircraft, as well as 12 attachments. The report concludes that the severe deterioration of the weather was the main cause of the three accidents. The overall civil aviation facilities in our country have not yet reached the ideal state. For more than ten years, the country's financial resources have been stretched, and all equipment has relied on foreign countries due to the backwardness of our domestic industry. Although there have been detailed plans for civil aviation airports and other flight facilities over the years, they have not been fully implemented due to factual and environmental limitations. Airlines are even less capable, and their inherent weaknesses are self-evident. Since the victory, ground transportation has been hindered, and the need for air transport has surged. The businesses of China National Aviation Corporation and Central China Airlines have been forced to make every effort to meet the demand. However, the inherently weak civil aviation facilities could not keep up with the need, leading to safety issues during flights in severely changing weather. Regarding the weather forecasting, aircraft communication, and management of various flight control technologies on the day of the three accidents, the Administration's detailed investigation concluded that, based on the existing equipment of the companies and the circumstances at the time, personnel at all levels were able to act cautiously, quickly respond, and make their best and greatest efforts without dereliction of duty. Based on this judgment, the only way to achieve reasonable development and safety guarantees for the civil aviation industry in the future is to rapidly improve navigation equipment and strive for accurate weather forecasting to remedy and improve the situation. The severity of the unfortunate incidents that occurred was unprecedented in the history of civil aviation in our country. The Administration, since its inception, has a duty to strive for improvement and development.

### Two British Aircraft Arrive in Shanghai, Carrying Back UNRRA Sailors

Two British civil aviation aircraft flew from Hankou to Shanghai yesterday, landing at Longhua Airport.

Therefore, two aircraft were specially chartered to take them back to their homeland. One aircraft is scheduled to leave Shanghai this morning, and the other will fly to Australia tomorrow. The flight route remains the same, via Hong Kong, Manila, and then south.

### Prosecutor Investigates Cause of China National Aviation Corporation Plane Crash in Tianmen; Aviation Group Denies Smuggling Gold; Officials Express Dissatisfaction with Staff's Arrogant Attitude; Awaiting Company Investigation Report

Awaiting Company Investigation Report

[Report from Our Newspaper] The repeated plane crashes recently have attracted great attention from the authorities. As the location of the headquarters of China National Aviation Corporation and Central China Airlines, the Shanghai District Court is particularly concerned about the repeated plane crashes. On the 28th of this month, the crash of China National Aviation Corporation's No. 145 Shanghai-Chongqing passenger plane in Tianmen County, Western Hubei, was particularly puzzling because the weather was good that day and there were no mountains at the crash site. It was rumored that the plane's wings were secretly carrying 200 gold bars, causing the plane to lose balance and crash. Others claimed that someone conspired to sabotage the plane by loosening screws in one or two important places before takeoff, causing mechanical failure and leading to the crash after a short flight. The District Procuratorate attached great importance to the case and specially dispatched prosecutors Zhu Xiyu and Liu Yongzhi to visit China National Aviation Corporation. The General Manager of the company, Shen Debian, was out, and the Chief Secretary Liang Jingzhao received them. According to Liang, after the No. 145 crash, the company had sent the Business Director Shang Dajing to Hankou to investigate the cause of the crash. The official report is expected to arrive in Shanghai within two or three days. The prosecutors then met with senior officials of the company's aviation group, including Director Wu Shi, Deputy Director Chen Hongen, and Assistant Wang. Wu Shi stated that even if there were 70 kilograms of gold being smuggled, it would not cause the plane to crash, as there were only 23 passengers, one captain, one co-pilot, and one telegraph operator on the plane, and the load would not exceed the limit. Regarding the theory of screws being removed or loosened, he also said that this was impossible, as the aircraft parts must be inspected before takeoff, and no damage was found. He also presented the aircraft's pre-flight inspection report to prove that the aircraft parts were in good condition before takeoff. At the same time, he solemnly denied the rumors of smuggling gold bars and guaranteed that this was not the case. He speculated that there were three possible causes of the crash: (1) severe weather, (2) mechanical failure in flight, (3) incorrect judgment of weather, flight routes, etc. by the pilot. The prosecutors then inspected Longhua Airport and examined the structure of the aircraft wings, returning late in the evening. Yesterday, when reporters visited prosecutors Liu and Zhu, they both stated that they could not express any opinions as the investigation was still ongoing. However, they believed that the arrogant attitude of the airline staff had a negative impact on their work and needed to be improved. The investigation of the case will not have new developments until the company's investigation report arrives.

### Personnel of the Ninth Inspection Brigade Announced

In order to unify the command of the military police and security forces within the Shanghai Garrison District, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters decided to establish eight inspection brigades and one waterborne inspection brigade, totaling 31 detachments.

After Jackson completes the inspection and returns to Shanghai, he will fly to Washington, D.C. to report to the headquarters in detail.

### Poisonous Potatoes Should Not Be Eaten During Sprouting

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a recent report from Lingdu, Jiangxi, the Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry stated that a local peasant purchased more than a dozen potato seeds from Guangdong. Because there were surplus potatoes, he fried them and gave them to two children (seven and five years old) to eat. Half a day after eating, the two children died. Therefore, he inquired about what kind of toxic substance was contained in the potato seeds. The Department of Horticulture of the Institute explained that when potatoes sprout, a toxin called "Solanin (C42H76N19)" is produced due to physiological and chemical changes. This toxin is mostly accumulated in the buds and under the skin. Once ingested, mild cases will cause throat irritation and diarrhea. If ingested in excess, it can affect the brain, causing paralysis, drowsiness, and convulsions. Pregnant women are prone to miscarriage if they eat it. In severe cases, it can reduce heart and blood circulation, causing excessive carbon dioxide in the blood, circulatory stagnation, and death. Therefore, sprouted potatoes should not be eaten. If you want to eat them, you must thickly peel off the buds and the skin, and soak them in water for several hours before boiling them. Only then can they be eaten. If they are not properly treated, it is also not advisable to feed them to livestock. Potatoes sprout most vigorously when planted in the spring. In other words, this is when the "Solanin" toxin is secreted most vigorously. The farmer did not detoxify the potatoes and fed them to children in large quantities. Children have weaker resistance, so they died half a day after eating, which was obviously poisoning.

### Married Woman in Love; Monk Tempts Her; Knowing It's a Nightmare, Yet Still Lingering

[Report from Our Newspaper] A student, Dong, from St. John's University recently filed a lawsuit with the District Procuratorate, accusing his wife, Dong Xianshufen, of adultery with the monk Bao Yun, the abbot of the Nanhui branch of Jing'an Temple. It is reported that Gu Shufen is 24 years old this year, and the monk Bao Yun is also 24 years old. Miss Gu used to teach at the Buddhist primary school attached to the Nanhui branch of Jing'an Temple, and the monk Bao Lian was also the principal of the Buddhist primary school. Working together day and night, it was inevitable that they would develop a relationship. Dong soon learned of the secret, and Miss Gu also knew that she was wrong. She wrote a letter to her husband expressing remorse. However, Dong recently discovered that his wife and the monk Bao Lian were still lingering, and the embers were about to rekindle. Unable to bear it, he sued the District Procuratorate and presented the previously written "Letter of Repentance" as evidence. Although there was no clear explanation in the letter, there were phrases such as "a nightmare..." The District Procuratorate accepted the case and separately summoned the monk Bao Lian and Dong Gu Shufen for questioning. Both denied the charge of adultery. The prosecutor is still continuing the investigation.

### Shipping Industry Decides Passengers Must Purchase Life Insurance for Passage; Fee Included in Ticket Price

The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau's Transportation Permit Port Committee passed a resolution and convened a meeting yesterday afternoon with the Shipping Industry Association and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to organize a review committee for determining the passenger capacity of ships. The first meeting was also held, and the following methods were discussed and resolved: (1) The passenger capacity of ships on long routes will continue to be implemented according to the original regulations of the Ministry of Communications. (2) The passenger capacity of ships on short routes (i.e., those that can run one round trip per day) will be doubled or increased by two-thirds compared to before. However, this method must be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval before it can be implemented. (3) After the passenger capacity of ships on short routes is increased, all life-saving equipment on board should also be increased proportionally. (4) In the future, all passengers must purchase life insurance before boarding. This insurance will be handled by the shipping company on their behalf, and the fee will be included in the ticket price. There were originally two lifeboats at the Wusongkou port, but they have not been restored since then. It was decided to report this to the Port Committee and ask the Customs to restore them to prevent emergencies.

### Social Services; Reader Consultation

Medical and Health

(1) Lung Disease Doubts Sun Tiejian asked: I am a lung disease patient, and I have several questions. I would be grateful if you could give me some instructions. (1) I have been having air injections for half a year, with a maximum volume of 750 c.c. The lung lobe has been compressed to 90%, but I am still unable to work. Even a slight movement causes my heart to beat non-stop and my breathing to be rapid. What is the reason for this? Will air injections induce "asthma"? Also, when the weather is colder, I accidentally catch a cold and have asthma, wheezing, and difficulty coughing up phlegm. Is this chronic bronchitis? What medicine should I take? (2) How many multivitamin pills should I take daily to compensate for this wasting disease? Why does the urine turn yellow-green within two hours of taking Squibb's multivitamin pills? Can I stop taking cod liver oil pills if I am already taking multivitamin pills? Are the milk tablets sold on the market better than capsules? (3) I am very prone to catching colds. Will taking "Aspirin" regularly worsen lung disease? (4) Before the air injections, I had four swollen lymph nodes in my neck (changing from hard nodules to abscesses). They have ulcerated one after another. After applying sulfanilamide ointment, two of the broken nodes have closed. Does this prove that my lung disease is gradually improving? Does the use of sulfanilamide have any side effects?

[Answered by Dr. Tang Renjin, MD] (1) After the lung lobe is compressed, the respiratory surface of the lung is reduced. If you do a lot of movement, asthma will naturally occur. (2) Lung tuberculosis patients need a large amount of vitamins. It is better to take several pills. The discolored urine is probably not due to taking multivitamin pills. You can take cod liver oil pills (AD) even if you are already taking a large amount of vitamin pills. (3) Pay attention to the weather and health care. Aspirin should be taken sparingly. (4) It is mostly a sign of improvement. There is no specific ointment.

### Shen Bao Newspaper and Renhe Hospital Jointly Provide Free Obstetrics Assistance to Poor Women

In view of the fact that poor pregnant women are often unable to afford delivery and medical expenses, which affects the health of the mother and child, and that there are quite a few such pregnant women who come to the newspaper for relief, this newspaper has discussed a cooperation plan with Renhe Hospital on Xiangshan Road to provide relief. Zhang Xiangwen, the director of the hospital, strongly agreed. After several consultations, the application method was determined as follows:

(1) Those who reside in this city and are truly poor and unable to afford delivery and medical expenses can obtain an application form from the newspaper by submitting a letter of introduction from a reader of this newspaper. After the form is certified by the chief of their respective Baojia, they can apply for registration to the Social Services Department of this newspaper.

(2) Renhe Hospital will conduct a preliminary physical examination for the pregnant woman based on the application form approved by Shen Bao. All outpatient and examination fees will be waived.

(3) Renhe Hospital will regularly set up free hospital beds. Pregnant women approved by the newspaper will not be charged for normal deliveries. Difficult deliveries will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

(4) The free pregnant women can be hospitalized for a maximum of ten days. In special cases, the period may be extended as appropriate.

(5) Renhe Hospital will settle the accounts once at the end of each month and submit them to the newspaper for publication. The expenses will be raised by the Shen Bao from all sectors of society.

(6) This free obstetrics assistance program will be determined to start from February 1947 for a period of six months. It may be continued with the consent of both parties after the expiration of the period.

### Two War Criminals Receive Prison Sentences: Badatini Gets Life Imprisonment, Shinohara Hisao Gets Five Years. Badatini, Suffering from Heart Disease, Wept Profusely Upon Hearing the Verdict. Four Japanese Military Police Officers Tried Yesterday.

[Report from our newspaper] Italian war criminal Badatini and Japanese war criminal Shinohara Hisao were tried by the First Pacification Zone Military Tribunal, and the verdicts were announced yesterday afternoon. Badatini was sentenced to life imprisonment for violating international treaties and supporting the war of aggression against the Republic of China. Shinohara Hisao was sentenced to five years of imprisonment with hard labor for repeatedly committing brutal and oppressive acts against citizens of the Republic of China, causing serious injuries during the war.

Badatini was formerly the Italian naval commander in Shanghai. After Italy surrendered, he was detained by the Japanese in a concentration camp. He was later released after reaching a compromise with the Japanese. The condition of his release was that he would send more than one hundred of his subordinates to work at the Jiangnan Shipyard, which was then a Japanese military arsenal, to produce military supplies for the Japanese army. Shinohara Hisao was formerly a Japanese naval military police sergeant in Shanghai. On the evening of March 26th of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he groundlessly arrested Chai Zhenyou, a builder of barges, and brutally beat him with wooden sticks seven times. The presiding judge at yesterday's trial was Li Liang, the judges were Lu Chao and Qu Zehui, the prosecutor was Tu Guangjun, the clerk was Wang Shuliang, the interpreters were Luo Di and Zheng Yiwei, and the defense attorneys were Ai Guofan and Qian Longsheng. After hearing the verdicts, Shinohara Hisao remained indifferent and expressionless, while Badatini's expression changed drastically and he wept profusely. Because he suffered from heart disease, he was released on bail to seek medical treatment at Wangxin Hospital during the trial. After complaining of dizziness yesterday, the court ordered him to be taken into custody. The defense attorney stood up and requested that he be allowed to continue on bail. Judge Li, after consideration, ruled that there were also doctors in the detention center, and if it was deemed necessary for him to receive medical treatment outside in the future, an application could be made, and it would be handled accordingly.

[Another report] The military tribunal also interrogated four former members of the Shanghai Japanese Military Police Corps yesterday: Kenzo Sugawara, Daisan Higashinaka, Teikichi Numano, and sergeant Morehiro Hirata. It is alleged that during their terms of office, these officers wantonly made arrests and inflicted brutal torture. During yesterday's trial, they vehemently denied all the accusations against them.

### For Greedy for Reward Money, Sold Out Comrades; Gambling Losses Led to Betrayal to the Enemy; Five Defendants Vehemently Deny Allegations

[Report from our newspaper] Zeng Xisheng, a former group leader of a certain bureau, remained in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation to carry out underground work. Together with his comrades Ren Musheng, Xiong Yuhe, Xiong Runsheng, Lin Zeyuan, Li Xiangsheng, Li Zhetang, Wang Runhe, etc., he infiltrated the Fujigang unit of the enemy military police as an informant. On the sixth day of the fifth month of the 31st year of the Republic (lunar calendar) [1942], Li Xiangsheng, Ren Musheng, Lin Zeyuan, and Li Zhetang, lost money gambling at the Far East Hotel. In a desperate situation, they conceived the idea of selling out Zeng Xisheng to the enemy military police in order to obtain a reward. The Fujigang unit immediately ordered the Japanese officer Shimazaki, along with Ren Musheng, Xiong Runsheng, and the translator Zhao, to arrest Zeng Xisheng, Ren Axing, Li Jinrong, Yang Yuansheng, etc., and brutally tortured them, eventually leading to the tragic deaths of Zeng, Ren, and Li. Furthermore, Wang Runhe served as a deputy detective in the Xinzha Police Station and the Shanghai Police Bureau until the victory [of the war], and was also involved in Li's case. The High Court interrogated the defendants Ren Musheng, Lin Zeyuan, Li Xiangsheng, Li Zhetang, and Wang Runhe yesterday, and all the defendants vehemently denied the allegations. Subsequently, the defendants' lawyers Luo Jiaheng, Xue Jiaqi, Wen Chunxiang, Gu Peilun, and Cai Xiaobai, stood up one by one to defend them. The court announced the conclusion of the debate on this case and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 15th. The five defendants were remanded in custody.

### Zhoupu Served as Police Deputy; Denies Kidnapping and Murder

[Report from our newspaper] Gong Zongyi, who is accused of being a suspected traitor, was tried yesterday in the High Court. The defendant, nicknamed "Little Gong," served as the captain of the "self-defense" corps in Zhoupu Town, Pudong, and as the deputy of the puppet police squad in 1937. With the enemy Sergeant Inoue as his advisor, he colluded with the deceased puppet regiment commander Xu Hongshe to harm eighteen patriotic compatriots. On October 7, 1938, he led his gang to kidnap Xi Jinfu and illegally detained him for nineteen days. In the winter of 1940, he sent his subordinate, nicknamed "Little Rebel," Shi Gengsheng, to kidnap Zhang Xingnan. On October 27, 1940, he again led people to drag Yang Jinfa to Shen's house in Yangjia Town and shot him in the head. He died from his injuries on February 16 of the following year. In July 1945, he sent Shi Gengsheng and others to shoot and kill Chen Xigen and his wife in a rice field. He also sent Shi Gengsheng and others to strangle Xu Dongyuan to death with a rope. According to the defendant's defense, "I was an intelligence officer in the Loyal National Salvation Army. For the convenience of my work, I held a nominal position as a deputy in the puppet police squad as a cover. I sent Shi Gengsheng to be a guide for the Loyal National Salvation Army, not to kill people." At this point in the interrogation, the court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the trial to a later date.

### White Russian Harmed Our Compatriots; Su Chengde Testifies in Court

[Report from our newspaper] The White Russian, Gao Liang, was accused of serving as a henchman of the enemy military police squad, specializing in killing our compatriots in the Zhonghua Gate and Guanghua Gate areas of Nanjing. Yesterday, the High Court presented Su Chengde, the former chief of the Capital Police Department, who had already been sentenced to death for treason, to testify. The traitor Su was wearing a blue cotton robe and black cotton shoes, his face was ashen, and his brows were deeply furrowed. Regarding Gao Liang's case, he testified that "In 1931, when I was in Nanjing, I heard of a White Russian named Gao Liang, who was cruel and vicious, specializing in killing our compatriots, and serving as an informant for the enemy military police." After completing his statement, the court ordered him to be dismissed.

### Labor Dispute at Sino-American Hospital Completely Resolved Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The labor dispute at the Sino-American Hospital was resolved at 3:00 PM yesterday through the mediation of Director Tao Yishan of the Garrison Headquarters. Employees' severance pay will be issued for three months uniformly, and February salaries will be paid as usual, to be cleared by 6:00 PM on the 12th of this month.

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the report in a certain newspaper the other day that labor-management disputes have successively occurred in the six major public utilities in the city, Director Zhao Banfu of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau stated yesterday that it was inaccurate and a letter of correction has been sent. Currently, only the French Tramway, British Tramway, and the water and gas companies have minor issues regarding year-end promotions, but it is not as serious as rumored.

### Many Disputes Due to Soaring Prices; Social Affairs Bureau Busy Mediating Cases

(Report from our newspaper) The continuous soaring of prices and the issue of labor-management disputes are of great concern. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently mediating and has resolved the following cases: (1) The wages of stevedores at various bank warehouses have recently been increased by 20% universally. However, the Bank of China warehouse refused to comply with the current workers' demand for equal treatment, and submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. (2) The employees of the Yizhong Tobacco Company requested a universal adjustment of their base salaries. The Social Affairs Bureau rejected this request because it conflicted with the regulations. (3) More than forty female workers at the Zhongnan Cotton and Wool Weaving Factory went on strike recently to demand an adjustment of their wages. The Social Affairs Bureau is sending personnel to mediate. (4) The issue of year-end bonuses for workers at the American Sunlight Match Factory has been delayed since December 29th of last year. The labor side is currently demanding one month's salary, while the management is only willing to give half a month's salary, resulting in a stalemate. The Social Affairs Bureau is still trying to mediate.

In addition, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory and Weixin Restaurant have dismissed workers and paid severance pay. The printing industry's demand for an adjustment of base salaries has also been resolved independently, with an additional 45 cents per day for those who do not take leave.

### Half-Brother Denounces Head Cook at Wine Bar; Allegedly Served as Enemy Army Translator; Sun Mingquan Claims Accusation is Malicious

[Report from our newspaper] Sun Mingquan was tried in the High Court yesterday on suspicion of being a traitor. The defendant served as a translator for Kimura, the captain of the enemy garrison in Zhaojialou Town, Nanyan County, during the 29th year of the Republic [1940], and committed numerous illegal acts there. In July of the 31st year [1942], Sun Defu and Qiu Zhengming from Zhaojialou Town were arrested by the enemy garrison. Because no one spoke on their behalf, Sun Mingquan slandered them, and both Sun and Qiu were later executed by the enemy. The defendant claimed: I worked as a Western-style chef at a wine bar in the Daqingfang area of Haining Road. I have never been to Pudong and do not know Kimura at all. The accuser, Sun Wenzhong, is my half-brother. He borrowed 370,000 counterfeit yuan from me in the 34th year [1945], and later I asked him to repay it, so he harbored resentment and falsely accused me. Subsequently, the witness Ma Dexing testified in court: I rented the house to the defendant in the 30th year [1941], and I never saw the defendant go to Pudong. Finally, the lawyer Zhang Naizuo defended him. The court ordered the trial to be adjourned to a later date, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

### Municipal Government Strictly Orders Each District to Conduct Random Household Checks at Any Time

[Report from our newspaper] The municipal government has recently found that the household registration statistics reported by each district regarding registration of origin, identity, and migration are very few. The figures for the floating population are even more lacking. It is evident that the household registration personnel at all levels have neglected their duties, and failed to investigate and register in a timely manner, which will affect the entire household registration work. This is highly inappropriate. Yesterday, the municipal government specially instructed each district office to order their subordinates to conduct household checks strictly and on time according to regulations, to guide the people in handling application procedures, and to report various statistical figures on time, and not to be negligent or delay matters. If any dereliction of duty is found again, they will be punished upon investigation. The district chief, who is also the head of household registration, will also be held jointly responsible.

The defendant, Gu Cheng Cuiyun, denied assisting in the conspiracy to kill her husband, claiming: I did not participate in the conspiracy beforehand, and I cannot be responsible for Xu Meifang's actions. I admit to the adultery with Xu Meifang without denying it, and claim that the affair began in July of last year. Xu Meifang claimed: That day, I saw Cheng Cuiyun and Gu Yucai walking leisurely near the Yuyingtang on Zhongxing Road in Hongkou. They seemed too intimate, so I went up to Gu to negotiate, which led to a fight. I accidentally pushed Gu into the river on the side of the road. Seeing that I had caused trouble, I fled in a hurry, thinking that Gu had drowned. I firmly deny the allegation in the indictment that I strangled him with a hemp rope and threw the body into the river. He also said that it was purely temporary anger and there was no premeditation, and Cheng Cuiyun did not help commit the murder.

### Gust of Wind Blows Off Military Cap; Soldier Jumps Off Truck and Dies

[Report from our newspaper] Approximately 70-80 soldiers from the 20th Rear Wounded Soldiers Hospital were leaving after watching a play at the Gonghe Stage on Zhongzheng Middle Road at approximately 5:45 PM yesterday.

### Central Bank Uses Blitz Tactics, Gold Prices Finally Forced to Turn Back

From 5.9 Million Foreign Returns to 5.6 Million Level, Still 300,000+ Better Than Previous Close, US Dollar Worries Continue

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, smelted gold once again created unprecedented high prices. It wasn't until a brief moment at noon that the Central Bank, using blitz tactics, began to suppress market prices. The morning opened with demand at 5.32 million, and immediately soared upwards. General psychology held extravagant hopes, and new buyers repeatedly joined in, causing a surge to 5.87 million before supply appeared. Moreover, as rationing approached, it quickly fell back. After 10 o'clock, the Central Bank supplied 1,700 bars at a price of 5.72 million, and buyers once again stirred, creating a rising wind. The market rose to 5.93 million, and the Central Bank supplied 3,000 bars with the market, whereupon the returning wind grew stronger, retreating to 5.74 million. However, buyers continued to blindly compete for purchases, once again rising to above 5.9 million near noon. Unexpectedly, in a brief moment after the noon close, the Central Bank seized the opportunity to slash prices and sell cheaply. For a time, there was a lack of buyers, and the fall was severe. Market prices shouted down to around 5.4 million before slightly stabilizing, rising back to above 5.5 million. The afternoon, being Saturday, saw no change. Quoted prices slightly strengthened to the 5.6 million level, resulting in 320,000 better than the previous close. Gold ornaments hung high at 58 yuan. Silver dollars were seen rising again. The underground money market was still stable, with interest rates only around 15%.

Foreign currencies also rose initially and then fell. The black market for US dollars opened in the morning at 10,500 and 10,800 yuan, circling and rising, with high prices reaching 11,700 yuan. At noon, it hovered between 10,800 yuan and 11,300 yuan. The afternoon, being Saturday, saw no special changes, resulting in 800 yuan higher than the previous close. Hong Kong currency started with a buying price of 2,000 yuan, rose to 2,300 yuan, and then fell back to around 2,150 yuan, continuing to be 100 yuan more expensive than the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate once rose to 2,300 yuan with transactions, but then there was supply but no demand. The Indian exchange rate was 2,840 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 36,600 yuan, both with supply but no demand.

Another dispatch: In the past week in this city, with the continued surge in gold and currency, various commodity and food markets have followed suit, tracking price increases. Various markets seem to belong to the buyer's world. However, the market's cash position is remarkably loose, and underground interest rates have not been seen to rise high. According to the observation of a certain expert: This phenomenon is probably a speculative market situation. With repeated surges, legal tender is competing in circulation in the market all day long. Since there is no day for returns, market conditions are rising steadily, and the turnover rate can only be seen to accelerate daily. Furthermore, since gold prices in various regions are higher than in Shanghai, floating capital is flowing to this city, so the market's cash position is flooded. It has not become tight due to the sharp rise in various items. Furthermore, in terms of the head positions exchanged by the four banks and two bureaus at the bill exchange over the past week, the surplus on the 3rd was 9 billion yuan, the surplus on the 4th was 9.1 billion yuan, the surplus on the 5th was 7.2 billion yuan, the surplus on the 6th was 2.5 billion yuan, and the surplus on the 7th was 4.2 billion yuan. Yesterday, although the Central Bank still had a surplus, when the four banks and two bureaus were calculated, there was a deficit of 4.1 billion yuan. It can be seen that the amount of surplus in the head positions of the national banks and bureaus in the past week is not significant. Although the Central Bank still stipulates that each bank's weekly exchange of funds to Shanghai is 30 million yuan, it is understood that there are no restrictions on military and political remittances. Judging from past circumstances, the amount remitted to Shanghai is often greater than civilian remittances, which is also a major source of increasing currency in the market.

### Mayor Wu Instructs Relevant Authorities to Strictly Enforce Rice Price Limits

17,000+ Bags of Siamese Rice Thrown Out Yesterday

### Unified Type C Bonds Worried About Rising Again, Up 500 Yuan Alone Yesterday

Government bonds rose again yesterday with the help of the environment. Unified Type C opened in the morning at 2,500 yuan. General psychology revived fantasies about the government's reorganization and raised it to around 3,250 yuan. After the high price, it triggered large households to sell, and then fell to 2,600 yuan. Finally, it hovered between 2,750 yuan and 2,800 yuan, resulting in a rise of 500 yuan compared to the previous close. Types A, B, and D were all flat, while Type E rose slightly by 50 yuan, with transactions not less than 4 million yuan.

### Twelve Types of Government Bonds to be Drawn for Redemption Tomorrow

Twelve types of government bonds, including the Type A bonds of the 25th Year Unified Government Bond, the customs gold, British gold, and US dollar bonds of the 27th Year Gold Government Bond, the first and second term bonds of the 29th Year Military Supply Government Bond, the first term British gold and US dollar bonds and the second term British gold and US dollar bonds of the 29th Year Construction Gold Government Bond, the first term bonds of the 30th Year Construction Government Bond, and the 31st Year Allied Victory US Dollar Government Bond, etc., are scheduled to be drawn for redemption on the 10th at the Central Trust Bureau.

### Artificial Silk, Although Demanding High Prices, Lacks Transactions

Yesterday, the city's artificial silk continued to rise crazily in the morning. 120's Guanggao Mountain's highest bid reached 6.2 million yuan, which made buyers flinch, and there were no transactions. Afterwards, it circled and fell back, resulting in two boxes of 5.8 million yuan being sold. In the afternoon, because gold prices also fell back, and the allocation of silk had been settled, and the joint venture company could also release materials next Wednesday and Thursday, the market momentum was unsustainable. The asking price was 5.5 million yuan, but there was no one to bid. Generally, 200,000 yuan might have inquiries, which was quite weak. The factory's warp, although high again yesterday, still had few transactions. Only a few dan of opening D grade were done, priced at 6.2 million yuan, which was 200,000+ yuan higher than the previous day. Another ancestor's dry warp was offered at 4.7 million yuan but was still unwilling to sell. The market momentum was quite firm and high. Silk goods continued to rise with raw materials. The morning was very chaotic. As a result, American Asian covers were 100,000 higher, Dacheng's checkered crepe was asking 16,000 yuan, with 5,500 yuan being sold, Huajin crepe was 100 yuan higher, and Shanghai Silk Factory's real silk covers were asking 3.65 million yuan yesterday, but there was a lack of stock, and holders were still unwilling to sell.

### Off-site Overbidding for Oil Prices, Miscellaneous Grains and Bursting Crackers Rise Fiercely

### Manufacturers Set Prices to Search for Purchases, Yarn Market Has Strong Buying Interest

Yesterday's yarn market, in the early morning, was stimulated by the crazy jump in gold prices. After the market opened, buying interest was strong. 32-count and 42-count double-strand fine yarns were most favored by the factories, and prices were set to search for solutions, rising by a distance of 1 million. At the close, due to too much floating profit, the market sold off, and prices fell to the lowest price of the day, finally rising 700,000 to 800,000 yuan from the previous day. 10-count Double Horse Dafa and various brands of coarse yarn were all 200,000 to 300,000 higher, and people's hearts were quite high.

### Tea Market Only Hears Bidding Prices

Yesterday's tea market: Sellers' minds went a step further, and the bidding price was raised more fiercely than before by 30% to 40%. Therefore, negotiations were difficult to reach a satisfactory conclusion, and transactions lacked formal openings. According to the news of colleagues, green flower tea, which is specially supplied for domestic sales, recently, the stomach acceptance around Suzhou may also have a comeback situation.

### Tea Merchants Demand Higher Tea Purchase Prices

According to news from the tea industry, after the government implemented export subsidies this time, the industry's situation has improved compared to the past. However, domestic costs and foreign selling prices still cannot meet the ideal, so whether the export volume can be expected to increase in the future is still a question. The market prices of various grades of export tea have gradually become firmer recently, but transactions are still very rare.

The market is full of buying voices. The selling prices of merchants change several times a day, making people feel like they are in a five-mile fog.

Yesterday's asphalt market saw Heben quoting 20,000 yuan per dan, while other goods rose by 20,000 yuan per dan. The previous market for beef tallow had a transaction of 360,000 yuan per Sima zu. Yesterday's market was asking 420,000 yuan. Coconut oil was purchased by several soap factories the day before, 390,000 yuan per dan.

At the close, due to too much floating profit, the market sold off, and prices fell to the lowest price of the day, finally rising 700,000 to 800,000 yuan from the previous day. 10-count Double Horse Dafa and various brands of coarse yarn were all 200,000 to 300,000 higher, and people's hearts were quite high.

### Cotton Cloth Price Review Meeting Resolves to Improve Price Negotiation Methods and Procedures, Requests Textile Control Commission to Simplify Yarn Supply Procedures

The Cotton Cloth Price Review Committee held its second temporary meeting at the Social Bureau yesterday. More than ten people, including Gu Bingyuan, Wu Shufang, and Dong Jiufeng, attended. Director Gu served as chairman, and the following resolutions were made: A. Due to the recent soaring gold prices, the quantity of yarn opened by Textile Construction is small, and prices are gradually increasing, which affects the normal supply of the market, and the black market rises accordingly. However, in order to accelerate the quantity of cotton yarn supplied to the market, it is proposed to submit a request to the municipal government to request the Textile Control Commission to immediately simplify the procedures for the 50% of cotton yarn that is currently being purchased, and supply it to manufacturers in advance to relieve the yarn shortage and stabilize yarn prices. B. The association had previously submitted a request to Mayor Wu regarding the issue of the existence or abolition of the Cotton Cloth Review Committee. Mayor Wu believes that although yarn prices are determined by Textile Construction according to market conditions, the Review Committee is still necessary. Therefore, it was decided to improve the price review method and procedures in five points: (1) Cotton cloth price negotiation will be decided by a subcommittee organized by the Textile Construction Company, the six district cotton textile industry association, the dyeing and weaving industry association, the dyeing cloth industry association, and the social bureau, each sending one representative, who will meet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 3 p.m. (2) The standard for the subcommittee's price negotiation should be based on the listed price of Textile Construction's cotton yarn as the main reference material. (3) If the price needs to be increased, it should not exceed the cost and market price. (4) If the market changes drastically, the association will still convene a plenary meeting to decide. (5) The price negotiated by the subcommittee will be announced by the Textile Construction Company and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association. C. The profit of cotton cloth merchants, of which the profit margin for single white fine cloth is reduced to 10%, and the others are still 12%.

### Mexican Gold Has Been Forced to Stop Exporting

[Reuters, New York, 7th] Gold industry insiders say that they believe that Mexico, under pressure from the United States, has given up its gold export business. According to private estimates, the total amount of Mexican gold exports in 1946 was between 90 million and 125 million yuan.

### Hog Bristles and Tung Oil Take the Opportunity to Raise Prices

[Our Dispatch] Since the announcement of the export subsidy method, the prices of China's main exports have soared. Among them, the price of hog bristles, compared to the market price before the 6th of this month, has risen by 60% to 70%. Most hog bristle merchants believe that it is profitable and hold on to the goods, resulting in a situation of having prices but no market. Tung oil prices have also soared. According to a person in charge of a Chinese vegetable oil factory, before the subsidy method was stipulated, the price of tung oil in China was already very high. Compared with domestic prices and foreign prices, there was a difference of 70% to 80%. After the subsidy method was stipulated, it rose again by 50% to 60%, so the domestic and foreign price difference has exceeded 100%. In other words, even with a 100% subsidy, tung oil exports still have to lose money, and recently the black market for US dollars has risen alarmingly, and China's tung oil exports may still inevitably go to Hong Kong.

According to the reporter's claim by the casings industry, the industry is in an extremely unfavorable situation. Xin Feng, the government's implementation of a subsidy system, is expected to recover. After that, the industry hopes to increase the export volume. One is to remedy its past losses, and the other is to offset the country's foreign exchange import surplus, which can have a slight effect. However, the purchase price of fresh intestines is the main issue in the future. After the Spring Festival this year, the initial price of foreign goods and local goods averaged 1,300 yuan per pair. Later, due to the weakness of the foreign market situation, it had successively decreased by 200 yuan. Since the government subsidy news was announced, the purchasing prices of various factories have recovered to the original price of 1,300 yuan, and today it has been increased to 1,600 yuan, which has increased by 30% from the price at the end of last year. Therefore, the association is also very needed in order to attract the source of rural goods to come in an appropriate dimension under the premise of raising the purchase price. However, any arbitrary pricing will result in self-deception. It is heard that the association will soon hold a meeting to discuss colleagues to take consistent steps to limit the highest purchase price.

### Chinese Stocks Shine, Yarn Wind Spreads Throughout the Market

Longjie met Shanyun in the first match, and the two sides fought fiercely. As a result, Longjie defeated Shanyun 5-1, with the score at 2-0 in the first half. However, Longjie's players acted improperly, which was criticized by the fans.

At one point, the ball fell in front of Shanyun goalkeeper Li Longming, and Gu Dirong actually stepped on Li Longming's abdomen with his right foot.

Li Longming was distracted and could not find the ball, and his back brain rebelled, making the score 4-1, and Shanyun was completely defeated.

### Basketball League Last Night – Qinglian Defeats Li Team – Perke Defeats V Team

As a result, Perke defeated the V team 28-21.

Aftermath of the Game

The game between the two sides last night was quite chaotic, with no strategy at all. In the last four minutes of the Perke-V team match, the score was 21-23, and the V team was still one goal behind. Zhu Mingxing and Zhuang Yikai shot many times, but none of them scored. Yu Ersui of Perke took advantage of the situation from both sides. In the last 20 seconds, when Wu Huizhao of Perke took a free throw, Zhu Mingxing shouted for a timeout, but the referee Hu Hongxin did not allow it. In the last six seconds, Yu Erjia of Perke had another free throw opportunity, and Zhu Mingxing shouted for a timeout again. Hu Hongxin thought it was intentional and did not allow it. Suddenly the mirror rang, and the ball happened to be in Zhuang Yikai's hands. Zhuang immediately hit Hu Hongxin with his hand, but did not hit him, and a storm broke out. Hu Hongxin was very angry and said that he would report the incident to the referee committee.

Starting at 5:30 PM today, three men's and women's games will continue at the original location, with the same ticket prices. The schedule is as follows:

Qianghua—Women's Qinghong (Women's Group) 5:30 PM

Chenyou—Huayang (Grade B2) 6:30 PM

Railway Jing—Encars (Grade A1) 7:30 PM

In the first game, Qianghua will play against Women's Qinghong. Both Qianghua and Women's Qinghong are making their second appearance, and their strength is relatively weak. It will be difficult for them to defeat the fierce Qianghua.

In the Grade B2 match between Chenyou and Huayang, both sides have won every game. This game is related to the future of the championship, and both sides will give their all.

In the last Grade A1 match, Railway Jing will play against Encars. Railway Jing's style is close to the Northern style, but they have not yet reached the level of mastery. Encars has a strong strength and can be expected to win today.

### American Domestic and Foreign Affairs, Also Discussing the Formation of a Third Party

— Sent from New York by Professor Jing Panshi, President of the Sino-American Christian Association of New York

For nearly a decade, the American government has been led politically entirely with the Democratic Party at its center. This isn't to say that the Democratic Party is inherently good and the Republican Party is inherently bad, nor does it prove that the Republican Party lacks talent, or that the Democratic Party has too much talent. These are not the primary reasons. The biggest reason is, on the one hand, due to the domestic and international political environment, coupled with the fact that the policies of Republican President Hoover were too inclined towards isolationism and capitalism, which aroused popular resentment (due to oppression by capital). Just then, the Democratic Party produced a great statesman, Roosevelt. Those who voted for Roosevelt at that time were not only Democrats, but also Republicans, because the intelligent people in the Republican Party also knew that their presidential candidate was not supported by the people. Roosevelt's election was certainly due to his great talent and political genius, but the environment that enabled his success was the main reason. Originally, his third consecutive term was already a stretch, but because the World War was in full swing and the United States was the arsenal of the United Nations, the people all understood the great principle of "an old horse knows the way," so he was elected for the third time. This was rare in the history of the American presidency. Unexpectedly, the fourth election coincided with the critical juncture of the war against Japan, and the people still believed that changing the elected official midway would inevitably affect the war against Japan due to domestic political changes. He was thus elected again in a favorable domestic and international environment.

In fact, in the customs of the American people, this was unprecedented upon unprecedented. The fact that the American people could so patiently elect him repeatedly was not entirely for their own benefit. On the contrary, it was for the sake of the overall global situation. These instances further prove that the American people have vision and are not always entirely selfish. In theory, Republicans could very well have not supported Roosevelt before and during the war, because the rights that Roosevelt's era gave to American labor unions had exceeded their limits. Later, it was even impossible to restrict the unions and workers. As a result, every time workers used unions to demand increased wages and reduced working hours, they were invariably successful, but at the same time, the products and profits of capitalists could not increase. Most of the Republican members represented the propertied class, and they had suffered losses for several years. Fortunately, they compensated for their pre-war losses during Roosevelt's term during the war. Even so, many Republicans still voted for him during the war, because of the overall global situation and because it could compensate for some previous losses. However, because the state's expenditures were enormous, and wartime military spending increased, Roosevelt's military taxes on the people were the biggest source of dissatisfaction for the Republican bourgeoisie, because the heavy taxes meant that capitalists gave nearly 75 percent of their earnings to the government. As a result, the capitalists' hard work and effort were often not as good as that of a foreman (a foreman often has a monthly salary of more than a thousand dollars). In particular, the government's price control policy caused the Republicans a great headache, while what the people got was the black market. These policies were originally good during the war and beneficial to the country. They should have been stopped immediately after the war, but because Democratic President Truman's policy was to conserve Roosevelt's original policies without understanding the great principle of adapting to the times, it further caused the people to have no meat to eat and no sugar to buy, and the black market prevailed. At this time, the people realized that free trade was better. Everyone competed to buy and sell, and as a result, prices fell. Although this was advocated by the Republican capitalists, it was indeed a method that the American people needed, and it has been proven to be effective in trial.

Since President Hoover, the Republicans had been frustrated for nearly twenty years. As mentioned above, the people had long wanted to replace the government with the Republican Party, but due to domestic and international environmental conditions, they were unable to do so. But now the situation is different, and the people's patience has reached its limit. Although the power of labor unions in the United States today is still extremely great (this was promoted by the late President Roosevelt), and socialists, laborers, and communists are gradually expanding, these ultimately cannot suppress the majority of public opinion. This trend has been fully manifested in the increasingly clear trend in the past six months. The initial example was that many people opposed the government's continued implementation of price control policies and heavy tax policies, because the people believed that the war had ended and they should return to the era of free trade and free competition. Although the Democratic Party said that this was instigated by the Republican capitalists, it was also true that the general public was willing to take a breather under price controls.

Congressional Elections Affect Domestic and Foreign Policy

The American congressional elections – not only in the United States, but also the most important American elections for international political figures around the world – the congressional elections, have now been fully revealed. Because the American congressional elections will affect American domestic and foreign policies, they will also affect countries that have close relations with the United States. China's relationship with the United States today is closer than ever before in Sino-American history. The Chinese people's view of the American congressional elections is naturally even more important. For several years, the Democratic Party has held the majority of seats in the upper and lower houses of the American Congress, while the Republican Party has held the minority. This is what the Republican Party wants to fight for. There are 56 Democratic senators, 29 Republican senators, and 1 Progressive senator. (Of these, 32 Democratic senators and 28 Republican senators will not be re-elected, so they are not affected by this election.) Therefore, if the Republican Party wants to win, it must have 21 more elected senators.) This is in terms of senators. There are a total of 435 representatives in the lower house, with the Democratic Party holding 235 seats, the Republican Party holding 192 seats, and the Labor Party holding 1 seat. A total of 47 states across the country participated in the congressional elections. Maine (Mslne) held its elections in September. There are a total of 35 million voters. At the same time, 34 states elected governors. Among these 34 state governors, Democratic governors occupy 16 states and Republican governors occupy 14 states. This is the distribution of Democratic and Republican forces in the American Congress and in each state.

The American congressional elections on November 5, which caused a worldwide sensation, have undoubtedly proven the great victory of the Republican Party over the Progressives. As a result, the Republican Party occupied 239 seats in the 80th Congress, while the Democratic Party occupied 196 seats. Although this is not comparable to the 1936 election, when the Democratic Party occupied 334 seats in the House of Representatives and the Republican Party occupied only 89 seats, nor can it be compared to the 1920 election, when the Republican Party won a great victory and occupied 300 seats in the House of Representatives while the Democratic Party occupied only 132 seats, compared to the Republican Party's situation of not having raised its head in 20 years, it is still considered a great victory for the Republican Party. However, according to my observation, this great victory for the Republican Party was a victory for the Progressive Republicans, or the left-wing Republicans, because the extreme right-wing Republicans are still not supported by the people. The reason is very simple, because these people are too selfish and too inclined to isolationism. These big capitalists all made fortunes by building military supplies for the government during the First World War and taking advantage of the World War. These few extreme right-wing Republicans are not supported by the people. On the contrary, the Progressive Republicans, or the left-wing Republicans, are those whom the people hope can replace the Democratic Party in power. When we study this election, we can find that if we say it was a victory for the Republican Party, it is better to say it was a defeat for the People's Livelihood Party. This election fully proves that the people fear and hate the Communist Party and the Democratic Party's Progressives, or left-wingers – such as former Vice President and Secretary of Commerce Wallace – because in recent years, the Democratic Party, due to Roosevelt's grant of too much power to labor unions, has allowed the Democratic Party's extreme left-wing and the Communist Party to work together hand-in-hand, and the Communist Party has gradually invaded the government and the people. This is something that the people regard as a terrible thing. The people were dissatisfied with the government because of this. During Roosevelt's time during the war, the people could still endure it, because of the overall global situation. Unexpectedly, in the past year or two, the power of labor has not been reduced, and the Democratic Party's extreme left-wing is still cooperating with the Communist Party. President Truman's efforts to stop it have not been effective enough, and the people are still dissatisfied. Wallace's dismissal is just one example. These are all major reasons for the Republican Party's victory.

Consistent National Policy: Adhering to Roosevelt's Platform

Some people, especially those in the Communist Party, analyze the results of this election, saying that it is because President Truman has violated Roosevelt's policies in both domestic and foreign affairs. This is completely untrue, because when he took office, he had already stated that he would continue Roosevelt's policies. These people also criticize him, saying: Because he has repeatedly yielded and surrendered to the pressure of the Republican Party and reactionaries, he has gradually abandoned Roosevelt's platform. They also say that in foreign affairs, he has undermined the peace policy of the Three Powers' unity and the establishment of a collective security system, and has promoted the Byrnes and Vandenberg so-called bipartisan hard-line anti-Soviet Union imperialist atomic bomb and gold dollar diplomacy policy. These are all reversals of the truth. The facts show that if President Truman had surrendered to the Republican Party and abandoned Roosevelt's policies, he would not have been opposed by the Republican Party. He would not have had to force Secretary Wallace to resign. He could have more strongly opposed the Republican Party and not cooperated with the Republican Party. In foreign affairs, I feel that Truman did not accept the opinions of the Democratic Party's left-wing (Progressive) people, such as Wallace, who were close to the Communist Party. On the contrary, he is a conservative right-wing Democratic Party policy. This policy is very cooperative with the Republican Party's left-wing (Progressive) – that is, it does not approve of the Communist Party's invasion of the American people and government. However, the Republican Party's left-wing is more active in opposing the Communist Party, and their views on the Communist Party are somewhat different from those of the Democratic Party's right-wing. In addition to Wallace, the important figures representing the Democratic Party's Progressives include Senator (Claude) Pepper) and the Governor of Georgia (Coveronor Arnall of Georgia). They are all so-called Progressives and liberals of the Democratic Party, but they do not know that they have gone in a direction that is greatly opposed to the will of the people. It is no wonder that even people within the Democratic Party are afraid of them. As a result, due to this phenomenon of division within the Democratic Party, the Republican Party won the election. International communists also said that it was because President Truman surrendered to the big industrial and commercial capitalists and undermined the sound methods of the United States' rapid restoration of a peaceful economy through control to prevent inflation. As a result, people's livelihood was difficult, society was unstable, and economic recovery was hindered. These situations aroused the dissatisfaction of the people, and the Republican Party took advantage of the people's emotions to make all kinds of nice promises to the people, so many voters fell for their tricks, and the Republican Party was able to win, etc. I am well aware of the reasons for the difficulties in the American people's livelihood and the causes of inflation. The reason for inflation is entirely because the government continues to implement wartime price controls. As a result, coupled with the government's heavy tax policies, capitalists cannot make profits from the goods they manufacture due to price controls. The government's heavy tax policies have not been reduced, and laborers are constantly seeking more, striking to demand reduced working hours and increased wages. An ordinary worker can get a monthly salary of 250 to 400 yuan, has a car to drive, and is still not satisfied. In this way, workers, supported by the power of labor unions, are always successful. When workers achieve their goals, purchasing power in society increases, and inflation naturally occurs. The common people can only cry out in pain and complain about the so-called liberals and Progressives of the Democratic Party and the despicable cooperation of the labor unions. This is the reason why people voted for the Republican Party. The direct reason was to strike a blow at the Progressive factions within the Democratic Party, and the indirect reason was to strike a blow at the labor unions and the Republican Party.

The conservative faction, or right-wing faction, of the Democratic Party and the progressive faction of the Republican Party cooperate very well. This is especially true of the Democratic Party leaders and congressmen in the South of the United States. The Communist Party views these people as reactionaries of the Democratic Party. They originally wanted to lead the government on a path that would adapt to the environment and benefit the people. The Communist Party considers these ideas to be incorrect. They believe that these people are destroying Roosevelt's policies and are the dregs of the Democratic Party. This is really an unfair and unreasonable criticism. On the contrary, they believe that Wallace is a progressive leader of the Democratic Party, and that only by supporting Wallace's proposals is one correct. We see that the American people are not confused. Regardless of any party, once it deviates from the right path and goes astray, the masses will immediately distinguish it, and will either not elect it or will overthrow it. Therefore, in the final stages of the election, the so-called Progressive faction of the Democratic Party – to which the Communist Party also echoed – held a large meeting in Chicago, calling themselves liberals, to discuss the progressive platform of the Democratic Party. Wallace attacked the President's foreign policy – a tough policy towards the Soviet Union. However, the American people were even more afraid that these pro-Communist Party people in the Democratic Party would come to power in the future, which would be even worse. Even the conservative people in the Democratic Party could not help but admit that this was not good for the Democratic Party. As expected, the Democratic Party was defeated after the election. Although the labor unions exhausted their strength and spent millions of dollars, they still failed. I feel sorry for the truly good candidates of the Democratic Party, because the Progressives of the Democratic Party were supported by the labor unions and the Communist Party, and as a result, the truly good conservatives of the Democratic Party were implicated and could not be elected. It was truly taking the blame for others.

Even so, because of the close cooperation between the labor unions and the Progressive Communist Party of the Democratic Party, a large amount of money and propaganda was spent. Fortunately, in New York State, the Progressive Lower House members of the American Labor Party, Majimunyi and Powell, were elected to their positions, and the labor representatives Xue Bei'er and Kaplan were elected as upper and lower house members of the State Assembly. These are the only pro-Communist members. It is better to say that the election of these few people was due to the compassion of the Republican Party and the people than that it was due to the will of the people!

Is a Third Party Possible?

Due to the Progressives of the Democratic Party, and some other groups and organizations, although they are called the Democratic Party, in fact, they have long had their own propositions and separate political views. Now there is a phenomenon that these several major forces may merge to form a third party. On September 28 of last year, the National Citizens Political Action Committee, the Industrial Workers Association Political Action Committee, the Arts, Graphics, and Vocational Independent Citizens Committee and other liberal groups held a meeting in Chicago. Their common goal was to seek a common foundation for joint forces. That great meeting included representatives from 31 states. The chairman of the meeting was Morgenthau, from the time of former President Roosevelt, and the agenda committee of the meeting was led by former Interior Minister Ickes. Those who spoke at that great meeting were mainly Senator Pepper and Lower House member La Fayette. Their momentum seemed to be quite large. After the three liberal groups in Chicago closed, liberal groups in New York also convened a joint meeting, organizing a "Liaison Committee." The goal of this committee was to establish a common policy foundation for liberal groups across the country. Many members of this joint meeting were well-known figures, such as former Treasury Secretary Geng Suo, Industrial Workers Association Chairman Mai Rui, the association's Political Action Committee Chairman Ke Luoer, National Citizens Political Action Committee Chairman Jinden, National Lawyers Association Chairman Le, New York United Bank General Manager Li Xixun, and Southern People's Welfare Conference Chairman Fu Erman. They were the most important roles. Others who participated in the meeting, although they were not the initiators of the meeting, but also enthusiastically participated, included Senator Whiteball and former Price Control Bureau Director Ersi. These many powerful people were mostly important officials who left the government during the time of the late President Roosevelt. Through this movement, they also launched a seven-person committee, responsible for reviewing groups that could participate in the meeting. It is said that many labor unions belonging to the American Federation of Labor asked to participate in their movement. These seven-person committee included Ke Luoer, Fu Erman, Independent Union Railway Workers Brotherhood Chairman Chongteler, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Secretary White, Artists, Arts and Sciences Vocational Independent Citizens Committee Chairman Davidson, National Citizens Political Action Committee Vice Chairman Baldwin, and National Farmers Association Chairman Baideng. These people cannot be completely said to be Democrats, but their propositions are the same. For example, they all supported Wallace's views on foreign policy and the atomic bomb. They said: "Because the United States continues to manufacture atomic bombs, our allies will have doubts and distrust. Only after the United States announces the cessation of atomic bomb manufacturing can other countries be willing to gather together to discuss on an equal footing." Their propositions on domestic policy: Rent must continue to be controlled, and a large number of houses must be built quickly to meet urgent needs. Protect the rights of the people, expand social insurance, attach importance to the welfare of workers and veterans, popularize education, science, and art. Improve the livelihood of farmers, develop national resources, support small and medium-sized enterprises, and rationalize taxes. This new political force, which cannot be ignored, is undoubtedly the convergence of the late President Roosevelt's policies. They are neither Communists nor Republicans, nor are they considered Democrats (although they are still Democrats in name). They themselves are a non-widespread political movement, supporting this movement are small and medium-sized capitalists, self-employed people, workers and farmers. These supporters represent the interests of the majority of the American people. The future of this political force is not something that can be ignored. If it develops according to the current development and grows into a third major political party, it is very likely to appear in the near future in the United States. But if they go down the path of communism, they will inevitably be abandoned by the people.

Future American Domestic Policy

Due to the Republican Party's victory in this election, we can be sure of the trend of American domestic policy in the future. Roughly speaking, due to the fact that the Republican Party can manipulate both the upper and lower houses, the first most significant reform will probably be to reduce the heavy tax policies set by Roosevelt during the war. The second will probably be to reduce the power of labor unions. The third will probably be to abolish all price controls. The fourth will be to actively promote free trade competition. Because the Republican Party also won the majority of governorships in this election, especially the re-election of New York Governor Dewey, this lays the foundation for the Republican Party to have the opportunity to nominate Dewey as a presidential candidate again in 1948. From the Republican Party's current point of view, the 1948 presidential election will be as sure as taking something out of a bag. They are very confident. However, it depends on whether the political environment changes at that time. In short, this election is, on the one hand, for the Republican Party to vent its fifteen years of pent-up anger, and at the same time, to prepare for the major presidential re-election in 1948. The significance of this election is mostly entirely in domestic affairs. The significance in foreign affairs is not very great. I will discuss it in detail:

Future American Foreign Policy

The Republican Party's victory this time is definitely not the resurgence of isolationism. This is a major change for the Republican Party in the past twenty years. It would be a great mistake if anyone considered this point. It would be even more absurd to consider that the Republican Party's governance would be unfavorable to China. They simply do not understand the Republican Party clearly. Not only now, but looking far ahead, even if the Republican Party is elected president in 1948, if the conservative faction (or right-wing faction) within the Republican Party wants to run rampant, it will definitely not be welcomed by the people. On the contrary, now and in the future, only the progressive faction of the Republican Party can gain the support of the people. As for the conservative faction of the Republican Party – the isolationists – they have been abandoned by the people for several years and are unlikely to rise again.

One point that the Republican Party will make in the future that deserves special attention from the world is its attitude towards the Communist Soviet Union. In my opinion, only this Beier Nasi policy will be strengthened, and it will definitely not be softened. As for huge loans to the Soviet Union, it will be even more difficult to achieve. Even for large-scale loans to any other country, they will definitely proceed cautiously. However, countries that are friendly to the United States may be an exception. For example, if Britain has a great need, the Republican Congress or President of the United States will also approve the loan. China is the destined friend and neighbor of the United States in the Pacific. The United States has a moral obligation to help. However, it depends on whether we know how to cooperate with this benevolent and powerful friend in the Pacific to build a modern new China in peace. In short, the United States' policy of aid to China will not only not change, but may even be more beneficial. Although it will not be tough on the Soviet Union to any extent, it will definitely not allow the Communist Party to expand further, because both the conservative and progressive factions of the Republican Party hate communism. Finally, I would like to quote the remarks made by New York Governor Dewey after his successful re-election. He said that he would use his greatest efforts to eliminate the terrorism of the Communist Party in New York City and New York State within his administrative jurisdiction.

### The Furious Songhua River: An Eyewitness Account of Battle Scars on Both North and South Banks

— Our Shenyang Correspondent Zhao Zhan

Airmail from Songbei, January 30th

Yesterday, over 20 Changchun reporters went as a group to the Songhua River to inspect the traces of battlefields on the south bank of the Songhua River after the Communist army's incursion into Songbei. The press vehicle departed in the severe cold of minus 32 degrees Celsius.

Arrival at Dehui, Meeting with Division Commander Zhang

Upon arriving in Dehui, we met Commander Pan Yu-kun, a veteran of the India-Burma campaign. In conversation, Commander Pan recounted the Communist army's brutality, casting a dark shadow of unease upon the reporters' minds. It was said that during the two weeks the Communist army occupied the Jilin territory, their most prominent atrocities were twofold: first, driving people to their deaths. It was said that in the battle of Jiaojialing, both sides suffered heavy losses. The Communist army besieged a regiment of the National Army, engaging in fierce battles for six days and nights. During the three most intense days, the Communist army attacked in waves of thirty or fifty men, resulting in mountains of corpses. Most of the dead were farmers. No one would believe that these simple farmers willingly fought to the death for the Communist army; it must have been forced upon them. The bodies of Communist soldiers killed in this battle were transported away in carts for seven days and nights, leaving all who heard it grief-stricken.

Pouring Kerosene, Burning Railroad Ties

Secondly, the Communist army's horrific destruction of transportation. The railway line between Dehui and the Songhua River was systematically destroyed, each railroad tie doused with kerosene and burned, and telegraph poles were toppled. Such destructive behavior is infuriating!

North of Dehui, we switched to jeeps to reach the banks of the Songhua River. The biting cold wind stung our faces, and as far as the eye could see, the snow-covered fields were as silent as death. Along the way, all the villages we saw were nothing but ruins, with no sound of chickens or dogs, and little sign of smoke. Occasionally, we saw two or three children standing by the roadside, leaning against walls and watching. They wore thin clothes, their heads shaved, and two trails of snot ran down their faces. When the reporters waved to them, they responded with timid and suspicious smiles.

County Magistrate Cui Discusses Reconstruction Matters

County Magistrate Cui Yunlan of Dehui accompanied us to Songhua River Village. Mr. Lin Guishan, the elderly chairman of the County Provisional Assembly, also came along, his mission being to handle refugee relief. While my colleagues were busy with military affairs, the county magistrate was a bit overlooked, so I took the opportunity to talk with County Magistrate Cui for a long time. He said that in the half-year since taking office, he has found local reconstruction to be extremely difficult, with destruction happening faster than construction. Dehui has a population of 303,860 people, with 30,000 refugees who are without clothes, food, or homes. During their mobile guerrilla warfare, the Communist army robbed all the oxen and seeds, making spring plowing next year hopeless. Famine and death in the spring are already a painful picture unfolding before our eyes.

The Common People Have Only Their Pants Left

County Magistrate Cui said: "The county's finances are extremely difficult. The source of revenue is land tax, but this year's land tax is collected at only 80% of the original rate, which has become a major problem. There is even less hope for next year. Despite being mired in poverty and distress, we still have to find a way to maintain a large security budget." From my observation, the common people really only have their pants left. Refugee relief has become a major issue. Taking Songhua River Village as an example, all fifteen households, over six hundred villagers, have become refugees. The relief grain received from the county government is only two dan (a unit of weight) of grain. County Magistrate Cui concluded: "My ambition lies in education. I will definitely be able to achieve one school per bao (a unit of area) this summer. Currently, the county has one middle school and over a hundred elementary schools, with over 17,000 students enrolled."

Farmers Had to Plead for Their Chickens

The desolate land after the disaster is facing a barren spring. I recalled the beautiful verses of the German poet Goethe and the profound theory they contained: "Gray, dear friend, is all theory, and green is life's golden tree." No amount of touching propaganda can erase the facts. People will experience the truth in experience. In the gray northeastern wilderness, the common people know who is right and who is wrong. What we worry about is the remoteness of green hope. Has spring already come? Why can't we see the land's new green?

The Communist army's political strategy is slightly more sophisticated than before. In this disturbance, they did not forget to win over the people, trying their best to please the poor. Rich farmers and merchants were all thoroughly purged, while the poor received some small favors. I entered a farmhouse where an old farmer raised more than twenty chickens. On the window of the chicken coop was pasted a red paper strip that read "Golden Chickens Fill the Rack," signifying the New Year. I was surprised that his chickens had not been stolen. The old man said, "I'm old, and I rely on these chickens for my livelihood. I kowtowed and begged to get the chickens back."

The Stronghold Stands Firm

The military guided reporters to visit the stronghold on the north bank of the Songhua River. The story of the stronghold in this battle is very moving. Two platoons of the National Army held their ground for eleven days without being breached. The bullet-scarred stronghold stands on the north bank of the Songhua River, the best witness to yesterday's battle. The railway bridge it guarded has been destroyed again. According to railway personnel, it will take a year to repair it, which shows the severity of the destruction. Judging from the terrain on both banks of the Songhua River Bridge, the east bank is lower than the west bank. The firepower of the National Army on the high ground of the west bank suppresses the Communist army from a commanding position. The east bank is a sloping ground with no large blind spots for concealment, so the Communist army had to sneak into the grass at night to dig foxholes.

County Magistrate Cui pointed to the dilapidated wall standing quietly and said: "Songhua River Village is a very good place for scenery. Many people come here in the summer to escape the heat." What I saw was not a single complete house. White Russians lived here, and it is said that one White Russian knelt down and begged the Communist army not to burn his house. Currently, seventy-odd White Russian refugees have flocked to Changchun.

Although Songhua River Village is dilapidated and lonely, as we bid farewell to it, we felt a deep sense of reluctance, constantly remembering the suffering compatriots here, tears hanging sadly from the corners of their eyes.

### Xi'an: Winter Departs, Spring Arrives

— Our Xi'an Correspondent Li Chi

The way the common people of North China divide the winter season according to weather is quite scientific: starting from the winter solstice, every nine days is taken as a segment. The first nine days are called "First Nine," the tenth to eighteenth days are called "Second Nine," and so on until the first day of the "Sixth Nine," which coincides with the "Beginning of Spring," and the last day of the "Ninth Nine" marks the end of winter. As for coldness, the "Third Nine" is considered the "absolute peak," hence the saying "Third Nine, Third, ice cracks the brick." This winter, the heavens have been particularly kind to the poor. Today is the first day of the "Fourth Nine," and the coldest days have not yet arrived. Heaven is good, clearly knowing that officials like to procrastinate. It's just a winter relief fund of 60 million yuan, which has been delayed until the "Fourth Nine" to be distributed. Fortunately, the "Third Nine" didn't "crack the brick," otherwise, how many new cold ghosts would be added to the underworld!

Investigation, registration, review, filling out forms and registers, taking fingerprints and affixing official seals. How much can each refugee receive? 4,000 yuan for a large household, 2,000 yuan for a small household, one-time payment. The original plan to issue it twice has also been halved. 4,000 yuan is just enough to buy one-tenth of a bag of flour, and 2,000 yuan can't even buy two steamed buns. The plan says to prepare to relieve 20,000 people, but the number investigated is far less than that. If there are really fewer poor people, that would be the best. But if there are poor people who can't get on the list, then they can only eat the northwest wind. Anyway, the poor ghosts die, it's their fate! Relief, relief, just a touch, following the rules!

The word "beggar" is not pleasing to the eye, okay, let's call it "Vagrant Reformatory." The daily food expenses for those housed in the "reformatory" are exactly 500 yuan, which has only recently been increased to 800. Is it enough to eat half full? That's only known to the heavens. It's a pity that most of the "vagrants" who should be "reformed" are "cheap bones." They can't be "reformed" in the "reformatory" and "flee," which is so "detrimental to the city's appearance." However, in all fairness, the shame of the city is not limited to the big and small beggars suffering from hunger and cold.

It's the same banknote, but a rich man gives it to a hungry ghost as "alms," and a poor man gives it to the boss as a "contribution." The people of Xi'an have also learned "humor" in their straightforward lives. Seeing that a bag of flour is still 40 catties, after the "Price Evaluation Committee" adjusted it twice within ten days in the middle of last month, the price per bag was "limited" from 25,000 to 35,000, and the black market frantically broke through 40,000. No wonder people say: this is not a "limited price," but a "tacit price," because the new price announced is even higher than the market price. What is this if not a "contribution"?

At that time, there was an episode: lawyer Zhang Hengxin filed a lawsuit with the local court before New Year's Eve, demanding food for the citizens. The court immediately dispatched bailiffs to the flour mill to seal up the account books for future verification. The flour mill responded hard enough, they stopped grinding flour, and at the same time, the Flour Industry Trade Union came forward, saying that lawyer Zhang was "destroying the lives of workers," "destroying industry," and should be "punished according to the law"! They also said that the accounts were sealed and they could not start work, but this distorted reason could not withstand the court's solemn statement. Now they have already resumed work, and the account books are still sealed.

In this episode, we saw the "magical" "flour offensive" again. Those who usually claim to be the "voice of the people" were silenced by the flour this time. The flour, as white as foreign money, has also whitened the tips of many people's noses. Those who should speak do not speak, but those who speak say what they should not say. Sealing the account books was a small matter, but some people deliberately linked it to the Communist Party's "liquidation," calling it "great treason"! (Then, who is "greatly loyal and filial"?)

Zhang Hengqi is also a city councilor of this city. In the fourth plenary session of the city council this month, some people predicted that this matter would at least give the listeners and citizens who eat expensive noodles a "happy" feeling, but in fact it did not. In the council, it was only mentioned as a matter of course, then "recorded in the minutes," "put on hold," without result. The chief prosecutor of the local procuratorate also did not clearly indicate that there was any way to handle the matter, how to handle it according to law.

No wonder that when things first happened, some people predicted that this would be nothing more than a "storm in a teacup," a "storm in a flour bag." Try listing the names, and see if there are any "news figures," officials and merchants, on the list of shareholders, directors, supervisors, etc. of those flour mills!

According to the report of the resident committee of the provincial council. The flour price in this city has repeatedly risen, which has greatly affected the people's livelihood. The committee has repeatedly passed resolutions to be sent to various newspapers for publication, but some newspapers have not published them, which is a pity!

The city council's accusation against Luo Chufan, the chief of the military affairs section of the city government, and Zhang Ji'an, the chief of the second district, for colluding and embezzling, was the most moving event in the council. At the meeting, the councilor questioned the section chief until he was exhausted and unable to defend himself, and resolved to immediately detain Zhang Ji'an, but the mayor said that he could only suspend him from his duties for investigation, with double surety, and be available for questioning at any time. The accusations against them include deducting the resettlement fees and conscription fees for recruits, levying additional recruits, withholding wages and tea money for airport construction workers, etc. The truth of the matter is still under investigation. It is said that the city government has held a secret meeting to review this matter. The division headquarters of the military control area is also paying close attention to the development of this matter, which may involve an unexpectedly wider range of people. In addition, some people also revealed that the problem does not lie in Zhang Ji'an alone.

This major event related to administration, I think, cannot also be "unfinished" and "unresolved."

A certain councilor questioned at the meeting: "In the recruit conscription center, recruits gamble day and night, and the host turns a blind eye; there are many sick recruits, and some have died...". Such actions are enough to make people "shudder"!

Public servants who "abide by the law and perform their duties" seem destined to endure cold and hunger. The new salary adjustment announced last month, although some are directly under the central government, have not been implemented to this day; the provincial-level ones can only be paid retroactively now. Not to mention the city-level ones, the monthly salary received by a city government clerk, after deducting the price of flour, is only a few thousand yuan, not even enough to make up a recently issued 500-yuan gold yuan new note!

Professors from Northwest University and Northwest Institute of Technology have repeatedly called for improved treatment, and resolved to go on strike on the 16th if a satisfactory solution is not obtained. On the 14th, they received a reply from the Ministry of Education, saying that "they are fighting hard to get the Executive Yuan's approval." The professors, in order to take care of the students' studies, temporarily maintained continued teaching. How much milk can a hungry cow squeeze out, and how much longer can it be squeezed?

In fact, there are figures that can be used as evidence. Even if salaries are paid according to the new salary standards in December, public servants' lives are still very difficult. Because the prices here have already far exceeded those in Beijing and Shanghai, but the treatment in the Xi'an area is classified as third-class instead. At the beginning of this month, seventeen units of the central government-affiliated agencies stationed in Shaanxi jointly telegraphed to request a change, and to be classified as first-class according to the Beijing and Shanghai examples, but there has been no response to this day.

Ultimately, we are not surprised to see the following figures in the statistics of cases accepted by the Jin-Shaan Inspectorate in the 35th year of the Republic: among the more than 1,790 cases, the most were those belonging to the accusation of corruption and bribery. This is an "explanation" and an inevitable "conclusion". (January 30)

Film and Drama Published Every Sunday

### "A Faraway Love" is a Milestone

— Ye Yiqun

I have often held the private opinion that the standard of domestic films has consistently lagged behind that of spoken drama, not only in terms of content but also in terms of form. However, after recently watching the preview of "A Faraway Love," this prejudice of mine was shattered. I feel that "A Faraway Love" inherits the excellent traditions of the New Drama of the past twenty years and develops them; at the same time, it gives full play to the unique strengths of film. Therefore, it is able to represent the development of reality over such a long period of time (fourteen or fifteen years) and such a vast space (Shanghai, Wuhan, Guilin). That kind of economical, concise, and vivid technique is beyond the reach of spoken drama; and its depth of understanding and representation of reality far exceeds that of past domestic films. Therefore, if we say that it is a striking milestone of the new film, it is probably not an exaggeration.

It takes the process of the combination and separation of Xiao Yuanxu and Yu Zhen as the warp, and the ups and downs of the waves of the times (September 18 Incident, August 13 Incident, Abandonment of Wuhan, Retreat from Guilin) as the weft. In this intersecting warp and weft, it shows the progress of working women and the regression of intellectual who are good at fantasy, and it also illustrates the trends of the masses in various eras quite clearly. This harvest is indeed valuable.

Perhaps some people will feel that it criticizes intellectuals too harshly, which is somewhat unfair. However, we must not forget that it only criticizes one type of intellectual, and not all intellectuals. Isn't Li Lianqun a side view of an upwardly mobile intellectual?

The appropriateness of the location and the beauty of the photography also created a new record for domestic films. In short, this is indeed a new harvest of film art developed after "Song of the Fishermen," "The Tao Li Tribulation," "Crossroads," etc.; and it has also found the right path for Chinese film art.

### Review of "A Faraway Love"

— Bao Zhongqi

"People cannot but be affected by the environment, and those who cannot adapt to the environment must be transformed." "A Faraway Love" develops based on this point.

University professor Xiao Yuanxi (played by Zhao Dan) is a psychologist. His personality is very exaggerated, and he is also very confident. His view of life is to use his thoughts to transform others. Therefore, he wants to transform a rural woman (played by Qin Yi) in his family into a modern woman. The result of this plan is successful. The ignorant rural girl becomes a modern young lady and becomes Professor Xiao's wife. However, after being educated, she discovers that Professor Xiao is just a theorist who cannot adapt to the trend of the times. He is full of opposition to feudalism, but he hopes that she will become a family woman under feudal thought. Of course, a truly modern woman is unwilling to be bound by these constraints. She knows how to cater to a great era, struggles to break free from the shackles of the environment, and devotes herself to the embrace of suffering China, dedicating her love to countless suffering compatriots. Finally, Professor Xiao is moved, and he understands the true meaning of love.

After watching "A Faraway Love," I admire the playwright's creation of the characters' personalities. Professor Xiao on the screen flaunts himself, shows off his skills, insists on his prejudices, and is good at criticizing others for not being able to adapt to the environment, but he is not good at blaming himself. In fact, his own thoughts also need to be transformed. Finally, on the way to escape in Guilin, he suffered all kinds of hardships: wading barefoot in water, receiving relief food, and warming himself with straw. Without the磨折 of hardship, how could he suddenly wake up? Thus, he felt the greatness of mutual assistance, and he understood the true meaning of faraway love. The playwright's indication is precisely this point.

The transformation of the two personalities of Professor Xiao and his wife is very difficult to perform well on the screen, but the director's technique is superb, helping the actors to overcome this difficulty. For example, the transformation of the rural girl Yu Zhen can be seen in her hair: in the era of the maid, she wore a big braid; when the professor transformed her, it had already been changed to two small braids, showing that she had gradually paid attention to decoration; after the transformation was completed, she completely became a urban woman. The hair has been permed, fully expressing her love of beauty; finally, she participated in women's work. The hair has returned to an extremely simple form. In addition to these that have obtained the greatest dramatic effect, there are many beautiful and moving pictures and interesting and lively shots on the screen: such as Professor Xiao's encounter on the way, the air of wanting to say but stopping, is a turning point in his life journey; a meal in a large hotel and swallowing a cake while fleeing is also a strong contrast; the ranks of Japanese soldiers on the road are an echo of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the future; and Yu Zhen's barefoot wearing grass shoes and Professor Xiao's taking off his leather shoes and going barefoot are also very meaningful comparisons. However, small flaws are inevitable. For example, in the opening scene of Professor Xiao's public speech, a few shots of a female listener applying rouge and powder and applauding seem unreasonable; the insertion of Manli's part seems superfluous; and the few scenes of the professor teaching class seem unrealistic.

Among the actors, Zhao Dan's Xiao Professor and Qin Yi's Yu Zhen, depicting two different personalities, have achieved the greatest success: Professor Xiao's talk is slippery and irrelevant, and the clumsy movements when he is down and out depict a living picture; Yu Zhen's mourning for the death of her father, brother, and child, and the subsequent undertaking of relief work, showing great love, can absorb the emotions of the audience.

The recording is probably not as ideal due to the limitations of the material environment, but I hope it can be continuously improved.

I recommend this film.

### Charles Vidor Talks About Rita Hayworth

— Xin Ming

Columbia Pictures' famous director Charles Vidor, "A Song to Remember" is his most successful work. Here is a conversation he had with reporters about Rita Hayworth:

I admire Rita as the most beautiful, sweetest, and most talented female star. In the past, we have collaborated three times, the first time was in "The Lady in Question" in 1940, and then there were "Cover Girl" and "Gilda." If the company authorities allow it, I hope to cooperate with her thirty more times. Because she is really like a tame baby, she is never late for acting, works extremely seriously, and will not ask you to allow her to go out for dinner at eleven o'clock or leave the set at four o'clock! However, when she is unhappy, she will also be very angry and stamp her feet; however, I can say that such a situation often happens outside of working hours, the reason is: "The life of a movie star is very hard after all. Imagine a girl who has to get up at six in the morning, makeup at seven, and work all day from nine o'clock until dark, lacking spiritual comfort and material enjoyment, can she endure it?" So Rita is sometimes very painful and easily hurt emotionally, so her marriage is also often unpredictable. When "The Lady in Question" started filming, she and Eddie Judson announced their divorce. When "Cover Girl" started filming, she had just married Orson Welles.

However, during the filming of "Gilda," one morning she did not come to work at the company. I thought something unexpected must have happened, because she never absents herself for no reason. Sure enough, that night, the news of her divorce from Orson spread throughout the entire film city, but the next day she still came to work at the company as usual. Her face did not appear pale, and there were no tears in her eyes. Everything was kept the same as usual. The staff on the set said in surprise: "What's going on?" She didn't tell me about this matter, and I didn't know at all. This is a mystery, always a mystery. However, I can declare on her behalf that she certainly did not have a "close friend" at the time.

Now fans are concerned about whether she will marry someone else again? She said "no" herself. According to my speculation, she still needs the comfort of the opposite sex, because she feels lonely. However, you have to ask: "Can she find a suitable person again?" Of course, I cannot answer this question with certainty, but I hope she can anyway. Rita can indeed be a virtuous wife and a kind mother, only if the husband understands her temperament.

### History Forest

— Jiang Niao

History Forest has already met the audience several times on the Shanghai stage, but the audience may not necessarily notice her because the roles she plays on stage are not young girls, but old ladies in their forties and fifties. However, her acting skills are quite superb. Recently, in "Women and Peace," she played the president of the women's association, and from her appearance, one can see the extent of her understanding of the characters in the play.

In "Women and Peace," it seems to span from feudal to modern times (which can be seen in both costume and acting). In the first half of the play, History Forest's costume is a long robe and a long scarf, while in the second half, it is modern women's attire. In the introduction of these two appearances, coupled with her own acting skills, her own cultivation, and understanding, she introduces this character very clearly. Just looking at her gathering her sleeves and her expression while sitting on the bridge reading is enough. Although this character is undefined, she can still introduce it clearly, which is not easy.

She is a graduate of the Beiping Art Academy, has a considerable artistic background, and therefore has a deep understanding of spoken drama. After leaving Beiping, she went to Chongqing to join the spoken drama camp. She enjoyed a high reputation on the Chongqing stage and was welcomed by the general audience as an actress. However, she is not satisfied with this, nor does she feel complacent because of it. In her own words, she is still learning, and the accusations and criticisms of friends and audiences are her best guides. She humbly accepts everyone's opinions, and from these humble attitudes, we can know that she is a remarkable actress.

She is a woman with masculine beauty, with a bold and unrestrained temperament and a healthy physique. When you see her on the road, she is definitely not a gentle, virtuous wife and mother type of girl, but a straightforward girl who means what she says.

### Sympathy and Hatred Watching "Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon"

— Guan Yu

"Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon" depicts a group of young men and women who love art, using drama as a weapon against the enemy, and exerting their combat power in the front and rear. This drama troupe suffered from wind, frost, rain, and snow during the eight-year war of resistance, and tasted all the hardships of life. The reward they got was a series of misfortunes, only with infinite comfort to their own conscience.

The male and female protagonists in the play, Gao Libin and Jiang Lingyu, joined the drama troupe since the beginning of the War of Resistance and did not leave the team until after the victory to return home. However, their home was gone, and they could only temporarily live in relatives' houses. Because they could not stand the decadent life of this family, they moved to a small attic-like house to live in, and their life was extremely poor. Jiang Lingyu, who was pregnant, worked late into the night. Because of the usual lack of nutrition, she could not support the heavy work and fainted by the roadside. If it were not for this group of friends in the drama troupe, she would have been carried out of the hospital.

However, in contrast to them, is Jiang Lingyu's cousin, a speculative, opportunistic scoundrel who only wants to become an official and make a fortune. While others were suffering for the War of Resistance, he hoarded and speculated to make a fortune from the national crisis, living a life of extravagance and drunken dreams. After the victory, he was even able to return to his hometown by plane and become a receiving officer, taking advantage of his power to seize the houses of widows and then resell them to others, earning gold bars from them. This kind of despicable and shameless person lives in tall foreign-style buildings and lives a life of being waited on by hundreds of people. And it is so peaceful and uneventful, how can people not be angry!

Today's society is so dark. Those who work hard all day long and do not speculate live a bitter life of hunger and cold; those who do things that harm others and benefit themselves and do not care about shame can ride in cars and live in foreign houses. It seems that this society is encouraging people to do more of this kind of illegal things. Otherwise, why can such bad guys survive in this society?

"Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon" gives us the facts of these two sides. The directors did not add a causal ending of "good is rewarded with good, and evil is rewarded with evil" to these characters. I wonder if the audience will think about how to pay out sympathy and hatred. I think: corrupt officials and奸商s will praise Jiang Lingyu's cousin and laugh at the other pair of fools!

### Random Talk About New Films

— Ma Bolang

Since You Left

Alas, the bones on the Pacific shore are still people who dream of deep struggles. The winter rain and snow fall gently, the owner of the house no longer returns, a sobbing woman's world. "Soldier's Soul" reveals the true lives of soldiers, but here are sparse, cold and 清清战士的 families, the rear without artillery fire, the reality in the eyes of Americans. The women here do not have a river to separate them, they are terrified by the aspirations of all mankind, love and life. Who has forgotten that peaceful world? The boundless wilderness, a pair of small figures running forward, songs chasing the floating clouds, the future seems limitless, rain shelter in the granary, tender affection, only in an instant everything is empty. Since you left, the hall is also so 条.

The director is Hank Powell, with a long history. "Little Rascal Biography", "Three Musketeers", "Secrets of the Louvre", "Wanderer at the Cape" are his masterpieces. He regards "Since You Left" as his representative work over the years. He recommended this film as one of the top ten blockbusters of 1944. His directing skills are very detailed, the empty seats at the beginning, the pipe, men's utensils, the things that Kean and her boyfriend eat in the restaurant, the man coming back to pick up things three times, the narrative is detailed, without omission. But in general, John Cromwell's technique is not as concise as Mervyn LeRoy's. "Since You Left" is an excellent film, but it is too long, and some places are a bit boring. When it is too detailed, it feels superfluous and can be omitted. The inability to be compact becomes a shortcoming. For example, the black slave covering Kean with a quilt to comfort her, the old colonel and the little girl cultivating flowers and plants, the mother and daughter taking the train to inquire about news, etc., are all extraneous and unnecessary. The crying scene is repeated, but it does not feel sad. In fact, it is enough to paint parasol trees and drizzle to be sad. Therefore, in terms of skill, "Since You Left" is inferior to "The Human Comedy" of the same meaning. The soundtrack of this film is worth mentioning, the "Ave Maria" during prayer, the "Home, Sweet Home" when returning home, and the southern folk songs sung in front of the wounded soldiers' beds are arranged very realistically.

The actors can be said to be made in heaven, and the lineup is lovely. Selznick's scheduling has always been appropriate, and everyone is suitable for their personality, and it seems that they have not made any effort in acting. Claudette Colbert's achievements over the years have proved that she is not just a comedian. The change in expression when listening to the phone at the end and in the dance is her forte, and I have a deep trust in her. Jennifer Jones won the Academy Award in 1943, playing a girl who is pregnant with spring, quite pure. She said that Claudette's eyes are the most beautiful among Hollywood actresses, which I cannot understand. Joseph Cotten is steady. Shirley Temple is about the same as "I'll Be Seeing You". Robert Walker is always interesting, more outstanding here than the assistant in "Madame Curie".

Flock of Chicks Playing with Phoenix

In love strategies, pretending to be stupid seems to be the key. Pretending to be a child to make the opponent's heart flutter is always guaranteed. It is also pretending to play with men, because there is an exaggeration of "between men and women" first, we praise Diana Barrymore's joy, anger and anger, and the farce directed by Henry Koster makes the audience laugh, and "Flock of Chicks Playing with Phoenix" feels plain. The director Billy Wilder is also considered famous. The ugliness of a group of children pursuing big things is all over the place. It is a pity that the person who pulls hair in the ball is not added to 利川 to create laughter, but just a row of original backgrounds.

Loretta Young's acting skills are not weak, peaceful and beautiful. This really plays three periods, all equally appropriate, really suitable for all ages. But she didn't wear any flattering new clothes, not like Diana Barrymore who showed herself all the time. Ray Milland did not have the opportunity to play like Robert Cummings, did not fall for Loretta Young's Susie, nor did he suffer a lot, and even could not pretend to be embarrassed. Only Diana Lynn, who played the younger sister of the fiancée, was only sixteen years old at the time, but she established her base for acting from then on.

Madame Curie

There are more stars in the sky, yes, Madame Curie's old teacher said it right, those stars of truth shine in the dark night. Madame Curie found that starlight, it was the wrong lock, the brilliance of love. In the drizzling rain, going away with an umbrella, under an umbrella is their eternal world. Mervyn LeRoy arranged the gentleness, he used his sophisticated lyrical technique, meticulously, wrote out the value of love, how great it can create. Madame Curie is not a strange person, but a woman who deeply understands the power of love. The marriage proposal and honeymoon trip have a relaxed melody of life, and all courage and perseverance can be restored in the embrace of love, not to mention the failure of more than forty times. Curie's death was also for his wife's piece of jewelry, a symbol of love. The scene when the bad news came, the silence after the knock on the door, was the stillness before the storm, the invisible climax, Madame Curie walked to the door, her painful face, thunder struck down, after examining the relics, she cried against the door, sad and shocking, and the pace of the door gap before the marriage proposal were two excellent treatments.

Greer Garson is acting in this role instead of Garbo, and I believe Garbo is probably not as calm as her. Walter Pidgeon's Curie is lifelike, vivid and just right, giving full play to his talents, Robert Walker, who plays the assistant, and Van Johnson, who plays the reporter, were still newcomers at the time, and now they have become famous.

Spring and Autumn

### Calligraphy of Master Hongyi

— Chen Xiangyao

In his early years, the Master often wrote ink by boat, and everyone knew that he could obtain the essence of the ancients; in modern times, he created a unique style of calligraphy, and everyone also knew that he had the aura of not eating human fireworks; however, few people can deeply understand and know the hard work of his skills and the concentration of his spirit. From observing his works, I think that the evolution of the calligraphy style created by the Master in the world seems to have three stages: at first, it was transformed from the study of steles, with a shorter body and more flesh; later, the flesh gradually decreased, the qi gradually converged, and the strength gradually condensed, forming a school that was more square and more regular. In the past two decades, the structure has changed from square regular to slender, the bones and flesh have changed from full to thin and hard, and the charm has changed from deep and majestic to clear and outstanding, forging the expression of his uniquely created whole personality, returning to the truth, surpassing the dust, and entering the wonderful aesthetic realm. What is unattainable is that every stroke is comfortable, every stroke hides the edge, and every stroke converges the spirit. To write this kind of character, one must first gather all the spirit in the heart, and then transport it to the wrist, penetrate it into the pen, and transmit it to the paper. What comes from the heart is a clear heart and a dwelling spirit! Therefore, his writing has a kind of aura of drinking spirit and hiding the edge, the heart is upright and the pen is upright, this is what it means, and it is different from those who casually wave and unrestrainedly. With the Master's character, the Master's spiritual cultivation, and the Master's aesthetic genius, there is the Master's kind of clear spirit flowing and the handsome calligraphy of the lines. This is generally based on what one usually understands and ponders. If based on the experience of my own retreat after spending two weeks imitating the Master's calligraphy the year before, then the most difficult thing to write in the Master's characters is the moment of 收笔 in each stroke. Those who can learn the Master's skill of gathering spirit and hiding the edge when 收笔 can be said to have attained the samadhi of this way.

In short, the vividness of its charm lies in the elegance of the lines; the elegance of the lines lies in the proper operation of Qi and strength; the movement of Qi and strength lies in the peace of mind; from peace of mind to Qi, to writing, to elegant lines, to vivid charm, and to the manifestation of spirit; the spirit of the character comes from the spirit of the person. Therefore, those who cannot learn his intention but want to learn his writing will eventually waste their learning. The "Buddha" character written by the Master, its lines are more and more diligent and resilient. You may be puzzled if I use the word "韧" to describe it. Why did the ancients see snakes fighting and 草法 fire advancing? Because when a snake fights, the place where the strength is used between the head and neck, one extension and one contraction, are all manifestations of the activity of the lines, all manifestations of the spirit of the 機条, and all manifestations of the resilience of the lines. The Master's calligraphy in his later years is becoming more and more tough, and has the strength of softness and firmness, especially not only the bone 清神透 that I discussed. It is also one of the best signs of the sunset's gorgeous yellow错.

### Recording Jianjiang's Remaining Paintings

— Liang Lieya

Jianjiang Shangren's secular surname is Fang, his name is Tao, his character is Liuqi, and his other name is Hongren. He is known as Mei Hua Gu Na. He was a survivor of the Ming Dynasty and was called Two Mei and Two Wu with his fellow villagers Zha Mei, Wang Wuduan and Sun Wuyi. Together, they were known as the Four Great Masters of Xin'an. He was also called the North and South Two Hongs of the Buddhist family with Fang Yizhi, named Hongzhi (one of the Four Young Masters in the late Ming Dynasty) of Tongcheng. Hongren was a master of sketching Huangshan. His strokes were clear, elegant, sparse, strong, simple, distant, and spiritual. He learned Ni but did not paint Ni, and he learned Mi and changed Mi. Therefore, he was able to surpass the ancients and form his own style. He was the crown of the Four Great Masters and the Two Hongs; he was also the most spiritual calligrapher in black ink since Li in the Ming Dynasty. It is a pity that his legacy is really too little!

Yesterday I read Mr. Xu Shiqi's "Wannan Journey" in the book written by Ben Quan, saying; "On both sides of the tomb road of Mei Hua Gu Na, dozens of plum trees are planted. After combining the sentences, when seeing its cold and solitary beauty in the ice muscles and jade bones, it will embellish the famous mountains. Further up is the tomb of Jianjiang Shangren. Jianjiang is a master of a generation of Xin'an, using fine Chinese labor to write Huangshan, the 　 standard style, unsurpassed at one time. Unfortunately, there are very few works handed down to the world, and it is impossible to ask the people in the town," knowing that Mr. Xu's return to his hometown this time shows deep respect and pursuit for the handwriting of his hometown's ancestors, and he regrets that it is not available in his hometown.

However, I was a guest in the Tangmo Township outside 　zhou City during the Anti-Japanese War (May of the 34th year). Old Mr. Xu Yian (Doubt will be Dong 　, named Chengxiao, a scholar of the Qing Dynasty, good at calligraphy and seal script, once served as the head of the 20th 　 civil administration, 　 repairing Anhui first, excelling in poetry, lyrics, and textual research, collecting ancient books and 　 Dun Shu Huanghua is very rich, and is a close friend of Zhang Taiyan and Zhang Fengzhi in writing articles) in Doukouli, I had the opportunity to admire two pieces of Jianjiang Shangren's left vehicles reduced by the old man of Doubt, which were exquisite, complete, extremely rare, and could be used as the teacher's book of 　 art.

First, it is the Xiaojiang Fengbian Tucuan, about five feet long and six inches high. Shangren himself inscribed in the scroll: "In November of the year of Xinchou, lay resident Boyan will prepare to imitate Guangling, and his friend Shengzhou lay resident Wu Yishan wrote a preface and scholars wrote the Xiaojiang Fengbian Tucuan as a gift." At the end of the scroll, Xu Chu wrote, "Guimao's beginning of autumn, Xin 　　 Xiaoqi, unfolded the scroll and calmed the heart, trying to destroy Qingqiu in the county, rubbing this 　　　." Later, there was a monk named Yiyi who wrote a sentence: "The pen 　 is tall and beautiful, and has been rarely passed down since Yunlin. Jian Gong has learned one change. The public lives in Hai Huangshan, and gets the true nature and temperament of Huangshan, that is, one tree and one stone are the original colors of Qing Huangshan. The style is cold and the life is alive, and there is no one who can do it now! Bingzi Chunguo visited Mr. 　ren in Bangshang and presented this scroll for worship. Each Yuansheng is an ancient connoisseur, and is not inferior to Boyanmei! Qing 　 beer respecter Yuan Ji knows". After I rewarded 　 this scroll. I feel that Jianjiang's distant and nearby landscapes, boat pavilions, and trees are all written with fine and strong complete strokes, creating a scene of morning dawn, wind and harmony. The spirit is beautiful and clean, without dust, making people feel that there is a higher level of thought in life. Therefore, I also said to 看寿 that Jian Gong's ten volumes were obtained from Yunlin's one change sentence. I believe that only those who can truly appreciate it can have such a thorough outpouring of words, and only the true original 　 can get this reputation. Moreover, Mi's Yunshan must use a wet paper and a wet brush, rendering it to create it. Jianjiang used dry paper and a clean brush to 　 paint it, so it is clear, elegant, and has a national style. He has surpassed Sanlin and broken away from Mi, forming his own style and school.

Second, it is a painted screen, six feet high and four feet wide. First, it is coated with white paint as the base, and Shangren used color on the white paint 　　 an old pine, branches 　 supporting horizontally, pine needles sparse and simple, full of charm, the paint color has not changed so far. Whether viewed up close or from afar, it is felt that the soul of that pine tree is alive. The inscription says "Jianjiang scholar writes for the former Zuo resident", with two large seals below, one is "Jianjiang Painting Seal" and the other is "Yun 阭 near people", all filled with red 溙, with an ancient and beautiful typeface. From this lacquer painting, we can know that Chinese painting is not only done with brushes and paper, but also with lacquer, starch, wood, fire, knives, cloth, silk, satin, silk, wood leaves, melon shells, stones, tiles, porcelain, bones, bamboo, mud, 　 and gold, silver, copper, tin, watercolor, etc. to paint, carve, sculpt, even use fingers and finger fields, tongues, etc. to paint. It is a pity that later generations are not willing to study the art left by the ancients and then seek progress, so there are still many people who use brushes, paper, and silk to paint and call it Chinese painting, and use cloth, lacquer, and watercolor to paint and call it Western painting, which seems to be a bit shallow and stubborn!

### Praise for Teng Baiye's Finger Painting

— Chen Xiaowei

In the past, Yang Huizhi and Wu Daozi studied painting from Zhang Sengyao. Huizhi knew that his academic ability could not compete with Daozi, so he retreated and changed to learn sculpture, each with great reputation! From this, we can know that painting and sculpture are closely related in art and have no consistency at the beginning.

Mr. Teng Baiye, an expert in finger painting, was originally named Gui and came from a prominent family in Fengxian County, Jiangsu. He once roamed Europe, specializing in sculpture and dabbling in painting. During his years of studying in Europe, he carefully observed the historical famous inscriptions of France, Italy, and other countries, and thus obtained the spirit of the art of sculpture in that country. After returning to China, he lectured on the beauty of each university and specialized school in the north and south, and sculpted bronze and stone 造偈 for revolutionary veterans and contemporary sages, with lifelike expressions. In particular, before the war, he was selected to sculpt the national father's portrait in Beijing. It is a pity that the construction of the statue was suspended due to the sudden outbreak of the war in the 26th year. This unparalleled masterpiece was not seen by people across the country, which is a pity!

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, Teng Jun 　 moved to the rear and traveled between Guilin, Chongqing, and Chengdu. During his travels, he enjoyed the magnificent and beautiful landscapes of the southwestern provinces, and his mood in the 陶中块垒 became more and more 嶔奇! Teng Jun originally worked on finger painting, but before the war, occasionally after tea and wine, when his mood was exuberant, he was teased by his friends and did it occasionally, just for the samadhi of the game. During the War of Resistance, Teng Jun saw the enemy's rampant behavior and the soldiers' bloody battles. His anger was entrusted to finger painting, and his art greatly improved!

Tracing back to the originator of finger painting in our country, everyone always takes Gao Qipei of Tieling as the standard. However, Gao's works are indeed rough and unrestrained and gratifying; after all, they are lost to greed and are slightly inferior to the divine awards in the paintings. Because Gao is a northerner, not the southern sect in Chinese painting, like a beautiful woman, the northern rouge is definitely inferior to the southern dynasty's 金粉. 　 Jun's reason for doing finger painting is that there is no lack of work in landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, insects, and fish, and there is no lack of lifelike expressions! His finger-painted landscapes are similar to Shitao, and easy to make 工致, character lines, learn from 佾县壁绘, quite 平艳可爱; flowers 绘鱼, then his achievements surpass the works of Qing 　 Baiyang笔绘, and make the animals and plants on paper have vitality,栩相然 alive 双通熙伦矣!

Last year's autumn, Teng Jun returned from 　一四 south, and all the collections he carried were finger paintings, which was like carrying the natural scenery of 大技方 with him. After being persuaded by friends in Shanghai, he held a public 胀览; if it were not for the eight years of anti-occupation, Teng Jun's achievements in finger painting would not be so 洋洋大观. A few words read by mistake are used for introduction.

### Flowers and Birds (Finger Painting)

— Teng Baiye

### To Teng Baiye

— Shi Chongpeng

On the eve of the Lantern Festival in Dinghai, Baiye invited Yu Ming to talk in Shi Qi Huangshan Art Garden. Baiye finger painting on the spot, birds talking and flowers fragrant, completed in one go. The exhibition will be held soon, so I wrote this to show my admiration.

The wonderful hand of sketching comes from your family, (Chinese flower and bird 　 was created in the Five Dynasties, the former 　吴人　 Changyou, was actually the first-class flower painter at that time, Huang Quan once studied under him). The Xu Huang of the Five Dynasties is not enough to boast; 　 荡际　 has intention first, and the spring breeze walks dragons and snakes on paper.

The wrist can參造化功, the finger揮洒趁党雄; different from the ordinary 向新蹊径, suddenly passing the old style of the Gao family.

### The Realistic Spirit in Western Painting History: 19th-Century French Painting Style

— Shen Yan

In early 19th-century French landscape painting, Michel can be considered a representative artist. In the changes in his style, one can sense the shift in landscape painting at that time.

If Michel's landscape paintings are arranged chronologically, they can be broadly divided into three periods. The first period was a time of groping in the dark, following the traditions of Dutch landscape painting. The second period was influenced by English painters, accepting the stimulation of Constable's style. The third period focused on natural and simple sketching, with realism gradually becoming more pronounced.

Centered around the mid-19th century, the era before and after was marked by the opposition of the Classical and Romantic schools, and the rise of the Realist school. The French art world entered a complex period. Therefore, the works of landscape painters who approached nature with sincere emotions inevitably reflected this kind of era character. On one hand, they poeticized trees and symbolized the mystery of forests; on the other hand, they depicted ancient ruins or peasant figures, possessing a dual character.

At that time, there were quite a few artists painting landscapes in France, but the painters with distinctive characteristics were the following four: Corot, Rousseau, Troyon, and Millet. These four had their own styles. Therefore, studying the characteristics of these artists can reveal the style of landscape painting at that time. However, the artistic value and social opinions of these four artists varied.

Among the new group of landscape painters, Corot was particularly outstanding. When he began to learn painting, traditional ideal landscape painters in France occupied a leading position, and their conservative tendencies even refused to acknowledge works that were not adorned with ancient ruins. Corot's travels in Italy and his early representative works, such as sketches of classical-era arenas, can confirm this tendency. However, the work "Crecy," which depicted an ancient arena, had a notable value in its simple and unadorned sketching tendency. Corot maintained this kind of sketching style throughout his long life.

Corot's later works, such as "The Belfry of Vézelay" (depicting the belfry as seen from Rue du Doyenné), retained the same sketching spirit as in his youth, but his painting skills were more skilled and complete than in his youth, approaching the early works of Impressionist painters of his generation.

Corot respected color and drawing in pursuit of harmonious overall effects. He also loved transparent and delicate rhythms. In simple lyrical poems such as transparent and clear watersides trembling in the gentle rhythm of tree shade, forests at sunset, and young women standing by the lake, we can feel his unique sketching style. His paintings never indulged in literary sentimentality, nor did they fall into formalism. His works were always fresh and full of vitality, all of which stemmed from the artistic life generated by Corot's realistic spirit.

If Corot's paintings can be called "lyrical poems of trees," then Rousseau's works should be called "narrative poems of trees." He favored the magnificent scenery of tall trees, treating trees as heroes. This aspect had Rousseau's Romantic nature, but his works also permeated with the spirit of sketching.

Troyon was a painter who inherited the Dutch pastoral landscape painting tradition and specialized in painting livestock. The livestock he painted were vividly integrated with the natural environment. If we travel to the outskirts of France, we are often moved by the beauty of the plowing oxen, and Troyon's pastoral paintings often depict this kind of scenery.

Millet had a significantly different character than the above three. In terms of personal relationships, Millet should belong to the above group of people. However, in terms of artistic trends and the history of French realism, Millet should belong to another system. He was one of the painters who, centered around the February Revolution of 1848, depicted the living environment of the working class, and should be compared with artists such as Daumier and Courbet. However, here we need to examine landscape painters from the perspective of realism, so we will briefly describe Millet's relationship with the three landscape painters based on his personal connections. He began painting peasant paintings after 1848. Since exhibiting a peasant painting at the Salon of that year, he devoted himself to this kind of theme. In terms of technique, his works were somewhat amateurish and lacked strength. As reproductions of photographs, they seemed quite excellent. However, when compared with contemporary masterpieces in the Louvre Museum, they were considerably inferior. However, his historical significance is so highly regarded because he was the first representative artist to depict the living environment of peasants from the perspective of the peasants themselves, and also represented the era's trend of seeking themes in the working class.

### In Memory of Master Hongyi

— Hua Lin

Liu Zhiping recently displayed Li Shutong's calligraphy in Shanghai and printed a special issue, containing "Illusory Fate," which narrates the greatness of Master Hongyi. The opening paragraph states, "Literati and artists in the world are most likely to be close to Buddhism. Because these two types of people, residing in the edge of intellect and emotion, easily perceive the world as illusory and realize the impermanence of the world. Therefore, Prince Zhaoming of Liang, who compiled the Selections of Refined Literature, was well-versed in Buddhism. Liu Yanhe, who wrote The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons, even became a monk. Wang Youjun, skilled in calligraphy, and Gu Hutou, skilled in painting, all had extremely deep relationships with Buddhism. Therefore, Li Shutong's becoming a monk is a very natural thing."

We don't need to criticize whether it is right or wrong for artists to become monks, but if a person wants to enter the world, they must bring a detached spirit to seek welfare for the people. They must also feel the impermanence and illusion of life, and issue great aspirations. The Samantabhadra's practices and vows chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra states, "I vow not to attain Buddhahood until I have liberated all sentient beings!" This kind of aspiration is a state of mind that a noble artist should possess. Playing with the beauty of lines and colors without being immersed in sensual pleasures and material gains; preserving precious youth without being decadent and degenerate! The so-called returning to truth and simplicity, and concealing the sharp iron tip, the cultivation of artists is very close to that of Buddha. Now, because of Master Hongyi's completion of enlightenment, we especially raise this issue, which has close connections with human philosophy and world thought, to express our remembrance.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 163

— Ye Jingfeng

As soon as I finished speaking, the phone rang outside. Ji Qun, being closer to the phone and quicker in action, had already picked up the receiver.

"Hello,...Yes,...What?... Qun's voice rose with each word, the last two words high and sharp, indicating extreme surprise. Immediately, she pressed the receiver to her chest, as if afraid we would hear what the other party was saying. She lowered her head, paused for a moment, and then slowly hung up the receiver.

At this moment, the room was extremely silent. The four of us had different expressions, but all of us appeared very nervous. As soon as the room became quiet, we could hear the booming of cannons outside the city, and the intermittent sound of machine guns, mixed with the noisy car horns on the streets, transmitted from the high sky, piercing our ears.

As Qun turned around, the color on her face had changed.

"Mr. Yue," Qun's voice was so low that it was almost inaudible, "The Concord Hospital called..."

"Oh!" He Jian responded sensitively, "Mr. Wu?..."

"Yes!..." Yao Qun replied, "...passed away at three o'clock..."

"How pitiful!" I thought Dingyuan had committed suicide again.

"Is he dead?" He Jian asked, his expression quite frightened.

"Almost the same as dead...He's gone! Left two letters, one for the hospital, thanking them for their preferential treatment; one for Mr. Yue, which the hospital has sent someone to deliver. It is said that someone saw Mr. Wu heading west, presumably out of the city."

"Impossible," He Jian insisted on his own view, "According to the phone call I received this morning, Matsui said that tonight he would pacify Puqing and Beiping. Xizhimen and Xibianmen are now experiencing fierce battles. How could Mr. Wu get out of the city?" As He Jian spoke, he had already pressed the doorbell to call someone.

"That just proves that Mr. Wu went to his death! Doesn't it?" Qun's face became even paler.

"No. 04" was standing solemnly in front of the door again.

"Old Brother, does 'No. 04' know Mr. Wu?" He Jian asked me.

"Yes," I quickly replied.

"Old Shen," He Jian said to "No. 04," "Take the special badge and armband, lead four people, drive a military vehicle, first go to the Concord Hospital, find out clearly what clothes and hat Mr. Wu, the engineer who just left, was wearing, what color, remember it specifically; then follow the trail – go out of the city through Xizhimen. If you encounter the National Army, hide the symbols; if you encounter the Japanese Army, reveal the symbols. Call back at any time, regardless of whether you find him or not. Target: Changxindian; preferably return to the unit by 8:00 PM!"

As soon as "No. 04" heard He Jian issue the order, he immediately pulled out a small notebook and recorded everything. After He Jian finished issuing the order, "No. 04" also finished recording. Then, following the outline he had recorded, he reread it to He Jian to avoid errors. This was a procedure that trained special agents would definitely have. Unfortunately, "No. 04" had a stutter. When rereading, he struggled so much that his eyeballs seemed about to explode. He Jian's nature suddenly became as fierce as fire when he encountered emergencies. Seeing "No. 04" stammering so much, he couldn't bear it, so he walked over, snatched "No. 04's" notebook, and inspected it himself. After inspecting, he determined that there were no omissions, and immediately returned it to "No. 04," waving his hand, signaling "No. 04" to leave quickly.

### Everywhere is War, But Overseas There is a Peach Blossom Spring: May the Peach Blossom Spring Be Forever Young

— Wu Hong

In this greedy, cruel, power-grabbing, selfish, and profit-oriented world, every day, everywhere, for a "private property" concept of humanity, but recently on the southeastern sea of ​​Taiwan Island, Such a paradise was found, very similar to Tao Yuanming's "Peach Blossom Spring" and the Western philosopher's "Utopia".

Fifty-six miles from Taitung and forty miles from Green Island, there is a small island called "Hongtouyu", which is now the easternmost territory of our country. There are a total of 1,275 residents on the island, all Malay aborigines, who still live a primitive life. Men work naked, working at sunrise and resting at sunset, living in groups, and there is no concept of "private property".

The island is rich in "Five-Leaf Butterfly Orchid", which is the world-famous unique product. Since it was discovered by the Taiwan Provincial Government, some people mistakenly believed that the original name of the island, "Hongtou", contained the meaning of "red worms and poison", and it was necessary to carry out "development" work. The Taiwan Provincial Government decided to rename it "Orchid Island" to match the island's special product "Five-Leaf Butterfly Orchid". Orchid Island and Hongtouyu both belong to the two towns of Taitung County.

Unexpectedly, in our "such and such" country, there is still such a quaint and admirable "Utopia". While feeling fortunate, the author only hopes that the island will not push forward its lovely original appearance after being "developed".

May the Peach Blossom Spring be forever young

### Shanghai's Underground World

— Yu Feng

The rice price, which had been quiet for a long time, has recently fluctuated again. It has been soaring up and up, so people who maintain a living with meager salaries have become anxious; but in Shanghai there is a problem of manure, which is actually as crucial as the grain problem, but has never aroused special attention from Shanghai people. It is just like how the current society values ​​embellishing the surface very well and neglects the most basic work in reality. However, if one day the "way out" of all the people in Shanghai must be temporarily "stockpiled", the result will definitely make everyone feel that this matter is more serious than the food problem. You should know that Shanghai's "export" volume of manure is more than the "import" volume of rice.

Everyone knows that "manure" is a fertilizer for growing fields. If you have your own field in the countryside, you can use it to fertilize the field. If you don't have a field, you can at least exchange some vegetables for food. But in Shanghai, I'm sorry, not only do you have to let the old masters pour away bucket after bucket for free every day, but at the end of the month, you have to pay several thousand yuan, if you don't pay, they won't pour it. As a citizen, you can argue about other things, but you can't force it when you encounter this kind of thing. If they leave it there for two or three days, it will be enough for you to suffer. Therefore, there is a 100% reason for the existence of manure pourers in Shanghai.

The entire Shanghai has four to five million manure-making machines, and the result of all-day production is naturally a huge number. Just from the more than 2,000 manure carts in the city, each cart clearing one or two hundred toilet buckets of inventory, you can get a glimpse of the mass production of manure in Shanghai. The manure pourers generally set off with their carts at three or four in the morning. Although they are dressed in rags, they always wear several shiny gold rings on their hands. When they come to collect money at the end of the month, some are even dressed in suits and leather shoes, their style completely different from when they were pushing the cart in the morning. The wealth of manure pourers is something that ordinary civil servants cannot hope to compare with.

As for the manure produced, several piers are parked with ships waiting to buy it. Manure dealers搶 buy the manure from the central district, because the people living in the central district seem to be always richer, and if they are rich, they eat well, and the manure produced is naturally more oily. There are also several gangs of manure dealers at the manure dock, such as Songjiang, Jiangbei, local, etc. In order to grab good manure, they often put on a full martial arts performance, and the scalpers are even more ubiquitous in "擺道子",燕舞鶯歌 pay tribute, can guarantee you buy good manure, so in addition to buying manure at the official price, it is better to "insert extra flowers" to drop some small money.

Originally, Shanghai's manure was contracted by the manure king, and none of those who did this business failed to make a fortune. Before the manure business was handled by the authorities, Shanghai successively produced many manure kings, living in foreign houses and sitting in cars, and even raising several concubines, behaving extravagantly; this kind of luxury is enough to show that manure is not only the same color as gold, but its value is also equal. However, now the manure king has finally disappeared, leaving only a group of people who are營想 to be the future manure king.

In addition to being poured away by the manure pourers, Shanghai's "manure" has many people who use flushing toilets or defecate in public pits. Although Shanghai has many public pits, sometimes it is also felt that the distribution of these public pits is uneven and insufficient, so at one time someone in Puan Road and other places opened public toilet companies—private pits, mostly a dilapidated house along the street with a few uncovered toilets inside, using the foul smell released to do advertising, male and female guests walked in without asking whether you brought toilet paper or not, you must pay hundreds of yuan for toilet paper before being allowed to take a seat. This kind of private pit receives hundreds of customers every day, with a bustling door, but it is suffering for the nearby residents, who are enjoying suffocating ozone all the time, but most of these private pits have now disappeared.

### An American Bride in England

— Yu Qiang

A slender American girl, with a head of long red hair, steadily stepped out of the plane with her legs wearing glass stockings and stepped onto British soil.

With a smiling face, she underwent immigration and customs inspections, walked to our streets, and began her new life as a British housewife.

When she arrived at her new home, she showed her "true colors" within a few hours, giving each of her female relatives two pairs of glass stockings that they didn't have – or almost didn't have! (Customs, unexpectedly, allowed her fifteen pairs of glass stockings to be tax-free).

She came from a relatively wealthy country to a country where everything had to be rationed. She came from a spacious modern American house to a dilapidated bungalow (which her brother had tried his best to find for her).

There was no car in the garage, no refrigerator in the kitchen, and no electric mixers, baking ovens, washing machines, or floor cleaners.

On the first day, she saw housewives lined up in a long queue on "High Street" waiting to buy bananas, so she joined the queue. Twenty minutes later, she became the first person and said to the clerk, "Thank you, I'll buy some bananas." But when the clerk replied, "Sorry, madam, no bananas without a ration card," her face turned red and she quietly fled.

One day, she hung six pairs of glass stockings on her clothesline at once, causing people all over the street to point and whisper.

"I guess this is because most British women treasure their last two pairs of top-of-the-line nylon stockings," she later told people.

Other things that the bride found "really interesting" were: the butcher selling her meat once a week with two "purchase registration books"; buying a pound of very small potatoes from a grocery store after standing in a long queue for ten minutes; ironing her sheets and John's shirts with a small shared iron; eating cream cake made with cooked fruit.

### Current Serious Social Problems in the United States

— United Press Special Report Translated by the Editorial Department of this newspaper

The judge said: '...Too much money is a major cause of divorce, because people who make "war money" are satiated and think of lust, and can no longer tolerate their wives who have suffered with them.'

According to the survey, the number of divorce cases in the United States in 1946 broke the highest record and continued to increase. Taking several major cities as an example, the number of divorce cases in the past year all set new records in history.

Judges handling divorce cases have put forward many reasons to explain this divorce boom, one of which is the wartime marriage that was hastily combined. However, another part of the judges blamed too much money earned during the war.

Indulgence of public opinion

Other reasons are housing panic, cramped living conditions, indulgence of public opinion on divorce, decline of religious forces, and veterans not accustomed to family life, etc.

A judge said: "Of the couples who got together during the war, four out of five end in divorce." Another judge said: "Often a couple encounters by chance, falls in love at first sight, and marries that day." Another judge said: "Cases of divorce due to wife beating are more and more frequent every day. In addition, 'too much money' is also a major cause of divorce. Because people who make war money are satiated and think of lust, and can no longer tolerate their wives who have suffered with them."

Reno, the capital of divorce cases in the United States, had a total of 11,000 divorce cases in 1946, breaking the record of 8,500 cases in 1945. The total number of divorce cases in the entire state of Nevada, to which the city belongs, also set a new record of 20,000 cases. A local judge in Reno said: "As far as I can see, the number of divorce cases in 1947 will definitely be even higher."

Alarming numbers

From July 1, 1945 to July 1, 1946, the total number of divorce cases in New York State was 19,895, compared to only 13,071 in the previous year. It is expected that there will be a continuous increase in the second half of 1946. The divorce rate in Chicago was 17,046, and although the divorce rate in Los Angeles and Hollywood has not yet been released, the authorities believe that the number in 1946 must be a new record.

Should the divorce law be abolished?

The surge in divorce cases across the United States has prompted the authorities in some states to take certain preventive measures. Donlan, a member of the Boston House of Representatives in Massachusetts, once proposed a bill in the state legislature to abolish the state's divorce law.

### The Woman Behind the European Powder Keg: Ruling Bulgaria

— Translated by Jia Yuan

The Balkan Peninsula is Europe's powder keg, as it was in the past and still is today. Currently, apart from parts of Greece and Turkey, the real power in the remaining countries of the peninsula is effectively in the hands of the Soviet Union. However, what methods does the Soviet Union use to control these countries, making them newly submissive within its sphere of influence, not daring to overstep? Some say it relies on the Red Army, and others say it relies on large-scale political secret agents. This is certainly true, but in addition to the Red Army and secret agents, it also relies on several outstanding women.

In Bulgaria, if you secretly inquire, "Who is the actual ruler of Bulgaria?" the answer you will get is: "Tsola Dragoycheva." This forty-six-year-old veteran communist, currently the Secretary-General of the Fatherland Front National Committee, possesses supreme power. She seems to hold a whip, ruling Bulgaria.

Once Sentenced to Death

Speaking of Tsola's background, it is quite thrilling. There was a time when she was a nationally renowned beauty, her hair emitting a fiery red glow, and her eyes were blue. In the past, she was arrested for plotting to overthrow the dictatorial regime of King Boris of Bulgaria and had been sentenced to death. But the reason she did not die is a miracle. It turned out that six days before her execution, she suddenly requested the jailer to conduct a physical examination. The jailer didn't care much, thinking that for a prisoner with only six days to live, checking her body would be somewhat unnecessary and ridiculous, and finally casually agreed. However, the examination proved that she was pregnant, and according to Bulgarian law, pregnant women cannot be executed, so the court had to change the death sentence to life imprisonment.

Tsola's child was born in prison. She lived in prison with the child who "saved her life," gaining the most intimate knowledge of the situation in Bulgarian prisons. Tsola had a great reputation in prison, so the government did not move her to different prisons. The mother and child spent ten years living in constant transfers, knowing nothing about the outside world, but her intense personality did not change.

Lurking Behind the Scenes

Later, Bulgaria granted an amnesty, and Tsola was released from prison but exiled abroad. She went to Moscow, where she met Georgi Dimitrov, the founder of the Bulgarian Communist Party. Dimitrov immediately recognized her as promising material and trained her in preparation for leading a coup in Bulgaria in the future. Then, the Soviet-German war broke out, and in 1942, she parachuted dramatically into Bulgarian territory and began to carry out strict organizational work within Bulgaria. When the Fatherland Front group overthrew the last Nazi puppet regime on September 9, 1944, the government had no difficulty in taking over the work, all thanks to Tsola's past achievements. From then on, she became the behind-the-scenes string-puller of the ruling elites, using her iron fist to effectively rule Bulgaria, a country adjacent to Greece and Turkey and of great strategic significance.
