[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Association of Nominated National Assembly Delegate Candidates of the Kuomintang recently submitted a letter to Chairman Chiang, stating their support for and hopes regarding the supplementary measures for the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan elections passed by the State Council.

### Wang Kuang, Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau, Discusses China's Shipping Administration

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Wang Kuang, Director of the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau, stated: "Before the war, China's shipping industry was jointly operated by Chinese and foreign merchants. There were approximately 1.4 million tons of merchant ships on inland rivers and along the coast, of which only 576,000 tons belonged to Chinese merchants. There were heavy losses during the War of Resistance. At the time of victory, only 457 Yangtze River steamers, totaling 80,800 tons, remained. All ocean-going vessels were lost. After the victory, efforts were made to revive the industry. Currently, there are 950,000 tons of merchant ships, including 1,179 ocean-going vessels and 2,138 river vessels. The Yangtze River trunk line has now restored 60-70% of its pre-war shipping capacity, and all other inland river routes have been fully restored. Supply and demand are still able to meet. What is gratifying to us is that inland river shipping rights have been recovered, coastal trade is entirely operated by Chinese merchants, and the number of ocean-going routes has increased from one (Manila) before the war to eight, namely Hong Kong, Vietnam, Siam, Guam, India, Japan, Singapore, and Manila. The largest Chinese merchant ship before the war was only 8,000 tons, but now there are Liberty ships of over 10,000 tons. Previously, crew members relied mainly on experience, but now they are able to absorb new knowledge and use new equipment, and their quality is gradually improving. In the coming year, the number of merchant ships can be further increased. The Minsheng Company has ordered 11 new Yangtze River steamers from Canada and 6 ocean-going vessels from the United Kingdom, all with modern air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has ordered 15 Liberty ships and 15 ocean-going vessels from the United States, and the Ministry of Communications has also purchased 120,000 tons of surplus ships from the United States to compensate for the wartime losses of private shipping companies. Furthermore, 350 ships of the Executive Yuan's Shipping Brigade can all be operated under the Chinese flag in the future. It is estimated that next year, China's ships can reach 1.5 million tons, restoring the total tonnage of Chinese and foreign merchant ships to the pre-war level."

### Severe Coal Shortage in Changchun; Soybean Cake Temporarily Used as Fuel

[Central News Agency, Changchun Dispatch, 28th] The issue of power generation in Changchun City has become increasingly serious. Due to the lack of coal, the electricity bureau has been burning soybean cake for power generation since the 25th. However, the amount of soybean cake required is huge, using 100 tons per day, and it can only maintain electricity supply to a small number of important institutions and just over a hundred food processing businesses. A survey conducted by the city government within two days froze 1,200 tons of soybean cake stored by businesses throughout the city, but this can only maintain power generation for half a month. If power generation is stopped due to fuel shortage, then food processing will only be possible using primitive methods in the future. The authorities are now not only strongly encouraging the use of traditional methods of rice milling, but also mobilizing the technical personnel of the city government and the Scientific and Technical Association to start researching and manufacturing animal-powered rice milling machines.

### Ambassador Stuart Discusses Sino-American Relations; China Aid Plan to Be Proposed in Congress Next Month; Constitutional Government Is the Beginning of China's Bright Future

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Ambassador Leighton Stuart answered various questions from reporters at the request of the alumni welcoming party at Yanjing University on the 28th:

Q: How does the Ambassador believe that China's domestic problems can be resolved?

A: Peace talks are not easy, and war is not easy to defeat either side, so a solution will be sought through external factors.

Q: What do you mean by "external factors"?

A: The United States is currently planning a solution to the problem, which may be proposed in Congress next January. However, this problem may not be solved by the United States alone and requires the cooperation of other countries.

Q: Why is the amount of China aid loans that the United States will approve so small? Will there be an amount that can satisfy China's hopes in the future?

A: The importance is not the size of the numbers, but that it proves that Americans are paying attention to the China problem. At the same time, because some people in the United States believe that there are many corrupt and incompetent officials in the Chinese government, the use of the loan must be considered.

Q: What effect will economic aid have on the Chinese war situation?

A: It may prolong the war.

Q: Will the United States abandon China?

A: The United States wants to solve the European problem first. Ambassador Stuart added that he is not pessimistic about the China problem. As long as there is patience and hard work, there will be a bright future. China has begun to implement constitutional government, which is the beginning of a bright future. However, it requires the joint efforts of leaders at all levels to be successful.

### General Lucas Recalled; Related to China Aid Issue

### Rationing of Goods and Price Controls; Ministry of Economic Affairs Drafts Two Plans; To Be Proposed for Discussion at the First Annual National Economic Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently drafted two plans based on the implementation measures of the economic reform program: (A) Plan for the rationing of goods to public employees, including not only general public employees but also legally registered cultural workers and teachers in private secondary schools and above. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for the rationing of fuel and cooking oil, the Cereal Department is responsible for the rationing of food, the Ministry of Finance is responsible for the rationing of salt, and the China Textile Corporation is responsible for the rationing of cloth.

### Salary Adjustment Based on Index; Special Review Committee of the National Government Committee to Discuss on the 31st

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Starting next year, the salaries of public employees will be paid based on the cost of living index. The plan drafted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has been reviewed by the Special Review Committee of the National Government Committee and has been initially approved. The committee will reconvene on the 31st for further discussion. The method is to subtract the base figure of 20 yuan from the base salary, multiply by a percentage, then add the base figure of 20 yuan, and then multiply by the cost of living index, which equals the salary due. The percentages are set at 15% for those below 300 yuan and 10% for those above 300 yuan. This is equivalent to paying 21 yuan according to the cost of living index for the base figure of 20 yuan, paying 21 yuan plus 15% according to the cost of living index for those earning 300 yuan, and paying 21 yuan plus 10% according to the cost of living index for those earning 400 yuan. The characteristic is that, according to Chairman Chiang's instructions, more is added to those with lower salaries and less is added to those with higher salaries. As for the cost of living index, it is set at 66,800 times for January next year.

### Government's Unified Purchase of Raw Cotton Still Faces Many Difficulties

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Regarding the government's determination to implement the unified purchase of raw cotton, authoritative sources say that implementation is likely to encounter difficulties in the future. According to accurate statistics, based on the amount of cotton purchased domestically by private manufacturers in the past year, at least 17 trillion yuan will be needed next year. If the government is to control everything completely, it can only be maintained for three months, after which difficulties will arise. Therefore, according to his observation, the implementation of the unified purchase of raw cotton still needs to be studied.

### Yantai Food Shortage Intensifies; Municipal Assembly Appeals for Relief

### Philippines Expresses Impatience at Delay in Peace Conference with Japan

[United Press, Manila, 27th] Philippine officials are very impatient with the delay in the peace conference with Japan.

It is said that the current "state of war" in the Pacific is very unfavorable to the Philippines. Furthermore, Philippine officials generally wish that the conference would be held in Manila, but they would not object to meetings in Washington, San Francisco, or Honolulu.

Aveilino, a powerful leader of the majority party, said that he personally does not oppose the restoration of normal trade relations between the Philippines and Japan, but he emphasized that Japanese immigration must not be restarted. He said that Japanese travelers or businessmen residing in the Philippines should not stay for more than six months. He opposes Filipino-Japanese marriages.

Quirino, the current Foreign Minister, may represent the Philippines at the peace conference. He stated that the Philippines should obtain an important position in the conference as the "most severely victimized country" in the war.

Quirino pointed out that the contract between the Philippines and the British army expired six months after the war, but it is still being interpreted as valid because the term "after the war" is being interpreted as "after the signing of the peace treaty."

### New Legislation for Higher Education

In order to reorganize higher education and enable our universities and colleges to adapt to modern academic trends, the Ministry of Education drafted two bills, the "University Law" and the "College Law," which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and then to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. On the 22nd of this month, at a regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan, after a heated debate, the third reading of the two draft bills was completed, and they will soon be promulgated and implemented by the National Government. The "University Law" and the "College Law" are both legislation concerning higher education. There have been few changes in the university system. At the time of the implementation of the Constitution, the government, in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, re-established the legal system for higher education and promulgated its implementation. This is indeed a matter worthy of attention from the academic and educational communities.

Our universities originated earliest and have the longest history in the world. However, the ancient universities, such as the Imperial College and the Imperial Academy, had different systems from modern European and American universities. The origin of our modern universities began in the 21st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty (1895) when Sheng Xuanhuai requested the establishment of a Chinese and Western School in Tianjin. The following year, Li Duanfen established a university hall in Beijing. In the 24th year of the Guangxu reign, the Imperial University of Peking was established, which was the earliest national university in our country. Although Tongwen Guan was established in the first year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty before this time, its teaching purpose was only to cultivate translators, and its language proficiency only reached the level of Western primary and secondary schools, so it could not be called university education. After the founding of the Republic, the school system was revised, and higher education was divided into university institutes, universities, higher normal schools, and specialized schools, each divided into undergraduate and preparatory courses. In the eleventh year of the Republic, the school system was reformed, influenced by new educational ideas, and it was stipulated that specialized universities could be established, and universities would implement a elective system. Thus, the face of higher education in our country was renewed. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the University Organization Law was promulgated in the eighteenth year of the Republic, and the school system gradually became established. Higher education was divided into three types: universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools. Universities and independent colleges could establish graduate schools, and at the same time, the preparatory courses were abolished. Public and private schools established according to this school system have increased and adjusted annually. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, normal colleges were added to specifically train teachers for secondary schools. In terms of the development history of our higher education, school facilities, and domestic environment, our university system is still in its early stages and needs to be improved and enriched to meet the needs of the new era.

The current legislation of the "University Law" and the "College Law" stipulates that higher education institutions are divided into three types: universities, independent colleges (University Law), and specialized schools (College Law), which is the same as the old school system of the 18th year [of the Republic], and the organization of higher education institutions in the United States in this century is also largely similar. Other matters, such as the administrative organization of the school, the appointment procedures for presidents, deans, department heads, professors, associate professors, etc., and the regulations for various university meetings, generally either follow the old practices or are newly stipulated. Among them, the most noteworthy points are the main purpose of the university, the university system, the qualifications for student admission, and the establishment of provincial and municipal universities. I would like to briefly discuss them here:

1. Establishment of the Main Purpose of the University: The main purpose of the university is the basic spirit of the university, also known as Laski's "function of the university." The main purpose of our universities in the former Qing Dynasty was to correct trends and cultivate generalists. In the first year of the Republic, it was changed to teaching advanced academics, nurturing great scholars and adapting to national needs. The University Organization Law of July of the 18th year [of the Republic] stipulated that "universities should follow the educational purpose of the Republic of China and its implementation policies, to study advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents." The current "University Law" stipulates that "universities, in accordance with Article 158 of the Constitution of the Republic of China, aim to study advanced academics and cultivate specialized talents." Article 158 of the Constitution stipulates: "Education and culture should develop the national spirit, the spirit of self-government, national morality, sound physique, science, and life skills of the people." This stipulates the basic spirit of establishing the country through education and culture. It can be seen that according to the provisions of this article of the Constitution, the universities we expect not only aim to cultivate specialized talents with advanced academics, but also should instill in university intelligence the promotion of the national spirit and the spirit of self-government, and the cultivation of democratic thought and a sound physique. In the world's educational trends, this law has clearly expressed the meaning of promoting national culture and democratic thought. We are very displeased with the current universities, which seem to only sell some superficial specialized skills, while neglecting how to teach students to be truly excellent citizens who can govern themselves and love their country. Moreover, the original article of the Constitution did not stipulate that the main purpose of the university is to cultivate "specialized talents." Whether the university should cultivate "generalists" or "specialists" is a controversial issue. Now that the university has made a rigid stipulation, whether it is suitable for modern trends and our national conditions still seems to be a matter worth considering.

2. Regulations on the University System: Legislation focuses on flexible application, especially legislation on culture and education, and should not be rigidly prescribed. The current university system in our country is originally divided into eight colleges: arts, sciences, law, commerce, agriculture, engineering, medicine, and education. Those with three or more colleges are called universities, and those that do not meet the conditions are called independent colleges. Three colleges must have one of the colleges of science, agriculture, engineering, or medicine. Specialized schools are divided into agriculture, engineering, medicine, and other categories. Graduate schools must have three graduate institutes, each with several departments. The current legislation takes a more flexible approach to the university system, focusing on practical application. The university regulations stipulate that universities are divided into colleges of arts, sciences, law, medicine, agriculture, commerce, and other colleges. Normal colleges should be established separately by the state, and national universities can also be affiliated. Those with three or more colleges are called universities, and those that do not meet the conditions are called independent colleges. The subject is not rigidly stipulated, which takes into account the development of the university's functions. The subject categories of specialized schools are also not rigidly stipulated, which emphasizes the practicality of higher education. The establishment of graduate institutes is limited to universities or independent colleges with well-run and excellent academic departments, regardless of whether they are public or private, and is not limited to the establishment of several departments. The legislation is realistic and helpful to the development of university graduate institutes, which is no small matter, and is a great improvement compared to the past.

3. Relaxation of Admission Qualifications: The old university system in our country had stricter regulations on student admission qualifications, which is not in line with the spirit of the country and the school's teaching. During the third reading of the "University Law" in the Legislative Yuan, there was a heated debate for an hour on whether students with equivalent abilities should be allowed to be admitted before it was passed. According to Article 26 of the University Law: "The qualifications for admission to a university should be graduation from a public or registered private senior high school or equivalent school, or having equivalent academic ability, and passing the entrance examination." Article 19 of the College Law stipulates: "Those admitted to a college should have graduated from a public or registered private senior high school, or have equivalent academic ability, and have passed the entrance examination." This kind of relaxation gives self-taught students the opportunity to take the entrance examination for universities and colleges. The spirit of the legislation is fair, symbolizing that the gates of higher education will never be protected by a special minority, and the right to university education will be shared by young students who are eager to learn and make progress. We cannot help but deeply congratulate the general students who are poor but ambitious.

4. The Trend of University Regionalization: The distribution of universities in our country is geographically chaotic, with multiple universities located in the same area, and there is no reasonable division of labor among the universities. This is a waste on the one hand and lopsided on the other. Educational scholars in our country have long advocated the adjustment and regionalization. According to the provisions of the University Law and the College Law, the Ministry of Education has the right to examine the situation of national universities (colleges) in various places. At the same time, public universities are divided into three types: national, provincial, and municipal. The trend of regional establishment is already implied in the legislation, which is very necessary.

In short, the new higher education system is more progressive in legislation than before. If there can be good measures in administration in the future, university education in our country can gradually reach an ideal state. However, we want to point out that perfect school administration and organization are only the perfection of the body and form of the university, while the establishment of a new academic style is the soul of university education. Today, for university education in our country, the school system should be improved and enriched, and the promotion and cultivation of a new academic style is even more important than the establishment of the university system. After reviewing the new university system legislation, we hope that the education authorities and educators can pay attention to the promotion of the national spirit of establishing the country through culture and education!

Wang Lanseng Withdraws from the Election

[City News] Youth Party Legislative Yuan candidate Wang Lanseng has announced his withdrawal from the election. According to Wang, he originally intended to be nominated in the Fifth District of his native Jiangsu, but after the Nationalist Party and the Youth Party negotiated nominations, the Nationalist Party Central Committee changed his nomination to the Eastern District Industry and Mining Organization. Since he is not an employee of the industry and mining sector, he did not want to participate in the industry and mining sector's election. He then submitted this to the Central Committee of the Party for approval and withdrew from the Legislative Yuan election.

### Soviet Domination of Greece Controls the Straits, U.S. and Britain are Consulting on Countermeasures, U.S. Military Aid to Greece Should be More Important Than Economic Aid

[United Press Washington 27th Dispatch] Washington, 27th: A very important talk between British and American officials will begin here after Monday. Monday is the day the British cabinet meets to discuss the policies Britain should take towards the leftist government of Greece under Markos's leadership. Opinions have been exchanged here to decide whether Britain and the United States should send letters to Hungary, Romania, and Albania to inquire about the size of each government's forces and equipment. Britain and the United States are making this inquiry in accordance with the terms stipulated in the peace treaty.

[Reuters, New York, 28th] The New York Times' Washington correspondent said that the idea of immediately increasing US military aid to Greece is becoming more concrete. Due to recent developments, responsible officials at the State Department believe not only that economic and military aid to Greece must continue after the existing aid program ends on June 30, 1948, but also that special emphasis should be placed on military aid. The Greek Communist Party's intensified armed rebellion and the Communist Party's establishment of a "provisional democratic government" clearly necessitate a re-examination of the US policy toward Greece.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Former Democratic Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, said that the recent developments in Greece do not mean that the United States' efforts to repel Greek communism have failed. "Without the aid program to Greece, communism would have swept through all of Greece today. Once that group steps in, it is almost impossible to drive them out. It is better to spend one dollar to prevent them from entering than to spend five hundred dollars to drive them out. We cannot withdraw. This is not a fifteen-round boxing match, but a very intense struggle. We must win, otherwise, God help us. That's all I have to say. In the future, the Soviet Union will covet Turkey and the Dardanelles Strait, Egypt, and the Suez Canal."

[Associated Press, New York, 27th] The establishment of a communist government in northern Greece is another important strategy of the Soviet Union's determination to control the Dardanelles Strait, because establishing the Soviet Union as a major Mediterranean power is the dream of generations of Tsars. Greece is located to the west of the strait, so it is a powerful base for defending the strait. Since the Greeks are participating in the Western democratic camp, Greece is a barrier to protecting the status quo of the strait. If the Soviet Union wants to dominate Greece and then control the strait, the Greek monarchical government is fighting hard against the Communist Party. If the monarchical government collapses, a communist government will inevitably arise, becoming a vassal of Moscow. At that time, the Soviet Union will inevitably re-oppress Turkey to accept the demand for joint management of the straits.

### Short-Term British-Soviet Trade Agreement Signed in Moscow, Soviets Exchange Rough Rice for British Goods

[Associated Press, Moscow, 27th] The British-Soviet trade agreement was signed tonight at Spiridonovka Palace, the site of the 1945 Tripartite Foreign Ministers' Meeting. British Ambassador Bedell Smith represented the British side, and Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade Mikoyan represented the Soviet side.

[Reuters, London, 27th] It was announced here today that the short-term trade agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union was signed in Moscow on the 27th. Under the agreement, Britain can obtain 750,000 tons of rough rice from the Soviet Union, which can be shipped from Black Sea ports in early January. Britain will supply the Soviet Union with industrial equipment that can be provided immediately. The equipment requested by the Soviet Union from Britain includes sawing machinery, transportation machinery, heavy-duty motors, mobile generators, and civil engineering machinery. The agreement also includes the terms for the Soviet Union to repay the 1941 British credit loan to the Soviet Union. According to a British Department of Commerce spokesperson, negotiations on a long-term British-Soviet trade agreement lasting several years will be held next May, at which time wheat and lumber will also be the subject of negotiations. According to this agency's financial reporter, Campbell, the signing of the short-term British-Soviet trade agreement was slightly later than expected, but purely for technical reasons. This agreement is mainly based on the Soviet Union's exchange of rough rice for British machinery. Britain has also made some concessions regarding the 1941 credit loan agreement. The short-term British-Soviet trade agreement itself is not very important, because the rough rice that the Soviet Union will supply to Britain under the agreement is only 750,000 tons, which is only one-third of the wheat ordered by Britain from Australia, but several developments since British Minister of Commerce Wilson established the agreement with the Soviet Union in Moscow are of particular importance. The Soviet Union established and published the agreement on the eve of implementing its currency reform, which shows that the Soviet Union believes that this connection with Britain is sufficient to strengthen the Soviet Union's internal economy.

### Security Council Figures Watch Greek Situation

[Reuters, Lake Success, 27th] Security Council figures say that unless Greece's northern neighbors formally recognize the new government established by the Greek guerrillas in the north of the country, the Security Council will continue to regard the matter as an internal affair. Security Council figures also said that they do not yet know whether the Athens government intends to formally complain to the Security Council about Yugoslavia and Albania's assistance to the Greek rebels. The Security Council is scheduled to hold its final meeting of the year on the 2nd of the next period, and the three member states of Brazil, Australia, and Poland will also step down at the meeting on Tuesday, to be succeeded by the three new member states of Argentina, Canada, and Ukraine. A major event on the Security Council's agenda is the Indonesian issue, but a debate on the Palestinian issue will be held in early January next year.

### Passed Away in Egypt

[This newspaper reports] London 28th Broadcast: Alexandria News: Former Egyptian King Ahmed Fouad II has died of heart disease today at the age of seventy-eight. The former king abdicated and left for Egypt in 1946.

### French Government Decides to Increase Wages, Plans to Compromise with the Labor Sector, The Upper Classes in France Oppose Schumann's Measures

[United Press, Paris, 27th] It was learned on the 27th that the Schumann government has reportedly decided to increase workers' monthly salaries by 2,000 francs in order to compromise with the labor sector, but the upper and middle classes and both houses of the French parliament are increasingly opposed to its economic reform plan.

At the same time, a rare phenomenon occurred in the National Assembly, that is, a motion put forward by Communist Party members to reject the decision to increase the price of cigarettes manufactured by state-owned factories by ten francs was unanimously passed. It has been less than a week since the government announced the price increase. It is reported that the Senate, which usually only passes legislation from the lower house as a matter of course, is now prepared to obstruct Finance Minister René Mayer's taxation plan. The National Assembly has already cut billions of francs from the government's budget of 150 billion francs, and continued to cut 9 billion on the 27th. The wage increase rate decided by the cabinet will be announced on the 28th. This increase is said to be a victory for Finance Minister Mayer over Labor Minister Mayer, because the latter advocated increasing cost-of-living allowances.

### French Parliament Passes the First Part of the Budget

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French National Assembly today passed the first part of the budget proposed by Finance Minister Mayer by a show of hands. Technically speaking, this first part postpones the use of the 348 billion francs in the 1947 ordinary administrative budget to 1948, pending the passage of the entire budget.

### Bao Dai Secretly Arrives in Bangkok

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 27th] Former Annamese King Bao Dai was a guest at the Christmas dinner given by French personnel here. Bao Dai arrived here secretly from Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 24th with three attendants.

### Fierce Fighting on the Konitsa Highway, Greek Government Forces Reinforce, Air Force Bombs Strategic Strongholds

[Associated Press, Athens, 27th] A dispatch from the front line today said that government reinforcements destroyed 67 important strongholds of the guerrillas tonight and inflicted heavy casualties. In an attempt to open the highway to the city of Konitsa, 44,000 refugees could not stand the harassment of the communist army's attacks with 66mm caliber artillery and fled. The Epirus Plateau is covered with snow. Under the cover of night, government troops carrying heavy weapons arrived at the scene, preparing to launch a general offensive at dawn.

The fighting is in full swing on the entire line of the highway from the north of Kalbaki to Ioannina and Konitsa. There is also fierce fighting near the Konitsa-Voulocheri bridge. If the government forces want to break through the guerrilla encirclement, this gateway is essential. Although isolated, the Konitsa government forces are still holding on. After commander Doufas was injured and hospitalized, he still issued travel orders from his bed, repelling six major offensives by the communist army. At the same time, government aircraft have also participated in the battle, destroying two guerrilla artillery positions only two and a half miles from the Albanian border. The first part of the budget proposed by Minister Mayer will be postponed for the use of 348 billion in the ordinary administrative budget of 1947 to 1948, pending the passage of the entire budget.

### Judd Discusses World Situation, Advocates Aid to China

[Central News Agency, Lawrence, Kansas, 28th United Press] US Congressman Judd recently said that the people of European countries under Soviet control are praying for war to end Soviet enslavement. Mr. Zhou addressed the opening ceremony of the Christian Front Student Conference. He also said that there are currently two worlds, one controlled by the Soviet Union and the other controlled by Western countries. Zhun said that we cannot survive in two worlds for long, so we must seek unity through conquest or agreement. This unity can be achieved through dictatorship or through alliances.

He listed what he called the four most critical locations in today's world: Germany, whose problem lies in the relationship between Germany and other countries, and what kind of power it will become itself. The countries around Germany, whose people are praying for war to end Soviet enslavement. The Pacific, Mr. Zhou pointed out, the United States is implementing a Western policy, that is, on the one hand, it is aiding Europe to resist communism, and in Asia it is stopping aid until all of China is controlled by the Communist Party. The United States' problem should be how to use its vast resources and power.

### De Gaulle Leads the French Youth Party, Non-Communist Workers Plan to Form New Unions

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] Right-wing followers of De Gaulle announced today the formation of the French Youth Party, the second major development in French politics in 1947. The first was the split of the French trade unions, with former Secretary General of the General Confederation of Labor, Ishikawa, leading a million workers to form an anti-communist "Workers' Army." Both of these organizations arose as a result of the major strikes in recent months. The Youth Party is initially no different from other youth groups in France, but its size and leadership by De Gaulle are significant. Organizers say branches are already being organized in nine out of ten regions nationwide.

### Major Congressional Agenda in the US Next Year, Aid to Europe is the Main Theme, Republican Leader Taft Talks

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Republican Senate Leader Taft said on the 27th that President Truman's $17 billion aid plan for Europe is the major agenda facing Congress next year. It is said that the Republican plan on important domestic issues (such as tax cuts and government spending cuts) must wait for Congress to take action on the European aid plan.

Taft, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, also listed the following issues as major issues for the coming year, namely: the issue of Summer Islands joining the United States as a state of the United States, increasing the efficiency of the State Department's foreign intelligence program, and military assistance to Latin American countries.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] Democratic Senator Johnson declared today that the United States can aid foreign countries $2.16 billion in one year without affecting the domestic economy or causing a shortage crisis. If this amount is exceeded, strict organizational and price controls will be required, so foreign aid plans must be drawn up on a year-by-year basis.

### Britain's Remaining US Loan is Only Enough to Sustain it for Three Months

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Washington officials say that the remaining portion of Britain's US loan totaling $3.75 billion will be exhausted within ninety days. Financial officials from the two countries are studying how to sustain Britain until the implementation of the Marshall Plan. They fear that the current political situation in the United States, especially due to the upcoming presidential election, may cause other debates that will prevent the European aid legislation from being completed before March 31.

### On the Eve of the Peace Conference, a Coalition Cabinet is Needed, Katayama Expresses Support for the Crisis to the End

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Prime Minister Katayama attended the general meeting of the Japan Newspaper Reporters League held at the Prime Minister's official residence on the 27th and emphasized that a coalition cabinet based on the motherland is needed before the peace conference. The current cabinet will take on the current situation to the end. Its main points: Since the tripartite coalition cabinet is organized, the tripartite coalition should be strengthened to rebuild the motherland. The new party's movement being carried out lacks clear principles and policies and is not enough to achieve great power. To break through the crisis, it is not appropriate to actively implement socialist policies immediately, but to gradually implement them. However, he hopes to convene a peace conference as soon as possible, and its preparations have been stated many times. The cabinet's advance and retreat should be based on clear principles and policies, determined by the number of people in the Diet. If the general will of the Diet representing the people supports the current cabinet, I intend to take on the difficult situation and break through the crisis to the end.

### Prospects for Japan-China Trade

Exports will be processed agricultural, forestry, and fishery products worth $600 million, and other items worth approximately $745 million."

He also said: These talks will continue on Sunday.

[Reuters, Batavia, 28th] Gandhi, in an interview with a reporter from the Indonesian Republic's news agency, stated that Indonesia's victory is already in sight, and success is at the door.

### A Sea of Fire North of the Mud City Bridge, the Agricultural Goods Market Reduced to Ashes, Extinguished After Three Hours of Firefighting, Heavy Losses

[Reported by our newspaper] The agricultural goods market behind the Szechuen Road North Four Bank Warehouse (i.e., the Central Market established by the puppet regime), caught fire yesterday afternoon around 12:30 PM. The fire burned for three and a half hours, and more than 150 sheds inside the market were completely destroyed. Fire departments from the Central, New [City name], Hongkou districts, and the Zhabei National Defense Fire Brigade, totaling more than 20 fire engines, were dispatched to the scene, drawing water from both land and water to extinguish the fire. The origin of the fire was traced to an employee named Zhang Ming of the Yu Sheng Agricultural Goods Store at number 65 in the market. At the time the fire started, the room was empty and the windows and doors were tightly closed. Therefore, once the flames broke through the roof, the situation was already beyond control. Employees of the Chang Chang Agricultural Goods Store at number 67 next door discovered the fire and tried several times to open the door, but were unsuccessful. In an instant, the fire spread to the surrounding areas. When firefighters arrived at the scene, the inside of the market had already become a sea of fire, spreading from the northwest to the southeast. The area along the Mud City Bridge was completely covered in thick black smoke. After firefighters made every effort to rescue the scene and control the overall situation, dividing it into two fire fronts, the fire was finally contained at around 3:00 PM. By 4:00 PM, it was completely extinguished. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Whether it was caused by carelessness while cooking remains to be investigated by the Zhabei Police Department. The fire ground was littered with Chinese cabbage, sweet potatoes, salted meat, Shaoxing wine, and other goods. It is reported that over 10,000 dan of Chinese cabbage alone were destroyed, resulting in heavy losses, the extent of which is difficult to estimate at this time. When the fire was raging, police officers maintaining order at the scene apprehended a thief, Zhu Liangchen from Taizhou, who was taking advantage of the fire. They also confiscated stolen goods such as silk cotton blankets, scarves, and woolen sweaters. The person and the stolen goods were taken to the police station. At that time, traffic in the area, from the Mud City Bridge to Xinjiang Road and Mongolia Road, was completely cut off, and did not return to normal until 4:00 PM. Fire starter Qu Yiming, and witnesses Du Cailiang, Zhang Fengjin, and others have been summoned to the police station for questioning. (The picture below shows the scene of the fire, photographed by our newspaper)

### Automatic Adjustment of Public Utilities: Implementation Date Not Yet Determined

Regarding the implementation of the automatic adjustment method for public utilities, our reporter visited Mr. Zhao [Name illegible], Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, to inquire about the details. He said the following:

The automatic adjustment method for public utilities was approved by the National Economic Commission and serves as a national standard for determining prices for general public utilities. The method has also been issued to this city.

The Bureau takes the application of this method very seriously and is currently studying several key factors in the method, such as the increase or decrease in the cost of living index, foreign exchange rates, and fuel prices, to ensure that its application is practical.

The cost of living index for this month will be announced at the end of the month, and whether there will be any changes in fuel prices next month is currently unknown. Therefore, whether the automatic adjustment method can be implemented on New Year's Day of the 37th year [1948] is currently uncertain. Mr. Zhao continued, stating that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is responsible for supervising various public utilities related to people's livelihoods. On the one hand, it must consider the maintenance of each public utility, and on the other hand, it must also consider the burden on citizens. To respect public opinion, the Municipal Government has decided to invite members of the Municipal Council to attend meetings and solicit opinions before implementing this method.

### Shanghai Alumni of the Central Military Academy Welcome Generals Du and Chen

The Shanghai Liaison Office of the Central Military Academy held a welcoming reception for Generals Du Yuming and Chen Mingren yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the New Life Club.

### Tao Baichuan and Wu Shaoshu to Resign from the Municipal Council

[Reported by our newspaper] Municipal Councilor Tao Baichuan has been elected as a member of the Control Yuan. However, according to central government regulations, members of the Control Yuan cannot concurrently serve as municipal councilors. Therefore, according to Mr. Tao, he will resign from his position as a municipal councilor within the next two or three days. After his resignation, Bao [Name illegible] Sheng, a substitute councilor from the fifteenth district, will succeed him. Mr. Bao is 57 years old, a native of Shanghai, and currently serves as the managing director and general manager of the Yizhong Cotton Textile Factory Co., Ltd., and as a managing director of the East China Enterprise Company, among other positions.

Furthermore, Municipal Councilor Wu Shaoshu from the seventh district has been appointed as a legislator by the central government and, according to law, cannot concurrently serve as a municipal councilor. Therefore, Mr. Wu will also resign from his position as a municipal councilor. The vacant position should be filled by substitute councilor Zhu Bulan. Mr. Zhu is 59 years old, a native of Baoshan, Jiangsu, and previously served as the Director of Education of Jiangsu Province. He currently serves as the chairman of the Yanghang Rice Milling and Oil Pressing Co., Ltd.

### Religious Believers Form an Alliance, Willing to Continue to Fulfill Great Aspirations

[Central News Agency] Li Yujie, Secretary-General of the Chinese Religious Believers' Peace and National Reconstruction Grand Alliance, recently spoke about the fact that the public often confuses the Alliance with the Chinese Religious Believers' Fellowship Association, stating: "The Religious Believers' Fellowship Association was founded during the Anti-Japanese War by Master Taixu, General Bai Chongxi, Bishop Yu Bin, and others in Chongqing, according to the regulations of the People's Organizations. Its purpose was to break down barriers, connect emotions, and jointly save the country. The Religious Believers' Peace and National Reconstruction Grand Alliance was initiated at the end of the 35th year [1946] by religious believers of various different natures, aiming to unite religious forces, participate in politics with the spirit of peaceful struggle, and fulfill the great aspiration of saving the world. It is purely a transcendental religious political party in China. At this time of national crisis, domestic peace and cooperation have temporarily ended in disappointment. However, the Alliance still pays close attention to the realities of the crisis and the suffering of the people with a compassionate heart. Now that the country is implementing a constitution and political parties are being opened up, the Alliance will, in the future, take an opposition stance and work with domestic and foreign political factions and all progressive forces within the scope of peace and legality to continue to work for peace, save the world, and rebuild the country."

### Preparing to Dredge the Divine Shoal, Starting to Measure the Water Level

The Divine Shoal in the South Channel of the Yangtze River estuary has been neglected for years, and its summit depth, at its lowest water level, is only 18 feet. Even during minor floods and high tides, it is sometimes only 25 to 26 feet. Its shallow area stretches for as long as 20 miles, and has long been a major obstacle to the entry of large ocean-going vessels. The Shanghai Dredging Bureau, to develop port affairs and facilitate navigation, previously drafted a new plan for dredging the Divine Shoal and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance. As soon as it is approved, work can begin. It is learned that, to coordinate the implementation of the above work, the Bureau specially dispatched Jin Shizhong, head of the Hydrology Section, along with surveyors on the Lijian steamship last week to begin surveying the area. It is estimated that after this work is launched, it will take about four months to complete. At that time, a detailed chart will be prepared according to the water depth around the Divine Shoal as a standard for the future formal dredging of the Divine Shoal.

### Nautical Safety Association Holds Memorial Service

### Cartloads of Bones on Parade Scare the Hell Out of People: Over Ten Thousand Students from Universities and Middle Schools Raise Money for Winter Clothing

[Reported by our newspaper] More than ten thousand students from over eighty universities and middle schools in this city made use of their holiday yesterday to carry out a city-wide expanded fundraising campaign for winter clothing to assist the government's winter relief efforts. The results were satisfactory. According to preliminary estimates, the total amount raised yesterday, in addition to the 23,000+ items of winter clothing and over 200 million yuan in cash collected by Tongji, Jiaotong, St. John's, Soochow, and Zhijiang Universities, all other schools' clothing and money donations, together with the amount of clothing and money raised by each school since the self-initiated fundraising campaign began, are being sorted and tallied overnight and will be officially announced as soon as possible. The general liaison station for fundraising by various schools was set up at the Medical College of Tongji University on Shanzhong Road, and five sub-stations were set up in the northern, southern, southwestern, and northwestern districts at the law school of Tongji, Aurora, Jiaotong, and [School name], respectively, as resting and transfer points. Tongji, Jiaotong, and other schools dispatched seven propaganda vehicles and several roving clothing collection vehicles, which traveled non-stop throughout the urban area. Tongji's propaganda vehicle carried a skeleton used for teaching purposes by the school's medical college, dressed in ragged clothing, with the words "I am also a human being" written on it. Its emaciated appearance was shocking. Students who were dispatched to fundraise wore white cloth V-shaped symbols with the words "Help the Hungry and Cold." From morning to dusk, they traveled everywhere in the cold wind. Stations, theaters, dance halls, restaurants, and other public places and busy streets were all populated by male and female students. Many people were willing to donate generously after being persuaded with heartfelt words. According to the presidium of the joint conference of the Winter Clothing Fundraising Committee of Tongji and the other four universities and the persons in charge of the fundraising committees of each school, the winter clothing donated by each school will be concentrated and distributed in a unified manner around New Year's Day after several days of sorting to ensure that hundreds of thousands of refugees receive practical assistance in their urgent need. In the next few days, they will strengthen the investigation and visitation of refugees in various districts and formulate plans to encourage future fundraising based on the results of the investigation. They also stated that "Modern Chinese literary writers must recognize the international environment, the national conditions of our country, and the needs of the times and the people, and issue the true voices of our Chinese compatriots suffering in the current internal turmoil, create spiritual nourishment that will benefit the thinking and lives of the people, so that the people can be relieved of their suffering as soon as possible, and the country can restore peace and unity as soon as possible, so as not to betray the sacred mission of modern writers.

### "Singing, Speaking, and Entering Doors": Students Raise Money for Winter Clothing, Earning Widespread Sympathy

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Cold winds carrying ice and snow have already visited this prosperous city. Despite the below-freezing temperatures, the halls of singing and dancing remain brightly lit, and roaring fires burn in the villas of the wealthy. But what we see before our eyes are hundreds of thousands of refugees barely clothed, their lives teetering on the brink of death, shivering in the cold and trembling in the wind and snow. Who has no parents? Who has no children? While government relief efforts are still slow in coming, young, passionate students have risen up. Over the past few days, they have been raising money for winter clothing for the refugees and distributing the clothing. This work, initiated by a few universities, has spread like wildfire throughout Shanghai, radiating boundless warmth and bringing immeasurable comfort to those suffering.

Street Propaganda Vehicles Shout Everywhere

Yesterday, thousands of students from dozens of universities and middle schools sacrificed their weekly holiday to launch a comprehensive fundraising effort. Three-person teams and five-person teams were running around every corner of Shanghai, while propaganda vehicles were shouting on the streets. Piece after piece of old clothing, old shoes, and hats were collected from donors and, after sorting, were transported via sacks, carts, tricycles, and rickshaws to nearby refugee areas for centralized distribution. University students personally visited and investigated the slums, carefully examining the actual conditions of the refugees and distributing the items they needed one by one.

This is a moving scene depicting humanity's great compassion, intertwined with many touching stories.

Many Old Clothes and Pants Pulled Out from Under Beds

One group of students went to a lane in the central district to raise money. They first started singing songs, attracting the attention of people in the houses, and every door and window was opened. At this time, one student stepped forward and gave a loud speech, reporting on the suffering of the refugees and explaining the meaning of their fundraising efforts. Most of the listeners were moved and went to search for old clothes. Some threw them down from the upstairs windows, while others invited them in to collect them. They call this method "Singing, Speaking, and Entering Doors," which they consider one of the most effective fundraising "strategies."

A woman living in the front building pulled out many old clothes and pants, along with odds and ends, from under her bed. Her eleven- or twelve-year-old son, who was very clever and cute, also helped her search. As the fundraisers were about to leave, he suddenly pointed to the wool sweater he was wearing and said to his mother, "Mom, this wool sweater has a hole in it, let me donate it to them too!"

The Girl Was Moved to Tears After Hearing This

In a small family whose walls were covered with many works of art, a young man politely invited the students in for tea and enthusiastically found a fairly good student uniform. He said apologetically, "Because my wife just happened to go out, otherwise I could have found more."

Students raising money on the Zhaofeng Road encountered many local children who enthusiastically helped, voluntarily acting as guides and going door to door to publicize the effort on their behalf. One twelve- or thirteen-year-old girl, initially seeing a group of people approaching, did not know what they were doing and quickly tried to close the door. A fundraising student then said to her, "You are wearing very warm clothes, but there are many children like you who have no clothes to wear and are about to freeze to death." After hearing this, the girl was moved to tears and quickly ran inside, urging her mother to donate many of her own clothes.

The Poorer People Are, the More Generous They Are

Almost without exception, the poorer people are, the more willing they are to feel pity for the poor. Many small business owners and shoemakers generously donated items of clothing that they did not have much of to spare. Even more, several rickshaw pullers were willing to voluntarily transport clothes and bedding, firmly refusing the fares offered by the students.

Conversely, the wealthy elders in large mansions and deep courtyards were not, as one might imagine, able to donate a large amount of material. Often, from behind the windows of closed iron gates, the faces of doormen or servants would appear, saying that the master was not at home and could not donate, asking them to go to another house.

### Wrapped in Rags, Using Old Newspapers as Blankets

Although they often encountered closed doors and other misunderstandings during the fundraising process, the students' enthusiasm was always admirable. Sometimes they went deep into the night, braving the rain to distribute clothing and bedding, not caring that their own bodies were soaked by the wind and rain. As long as they saw the refugees smiling and accepting their gifts, those wrapped in rags putting on clothes and pants, and those using old newspapers as blankets covering themselves with cotton batting, a smile, a word of thanks, was enough to bring them the greatest comfort.

### The Mayor Expresses Gratification

[Report from This Newspaper] Mayor Wu Guozhen attended and addressed a gathering of students from specialized schools and universities in the city yesterday morning. He considered the enthusiasm of the students from various schools in raising money for winter clothing to relieve the refugees to be valuable and expressed his gratification. He said: In order to avoid overlapping fundraising efforts by various schools, he hoped that matters related to winter relief would be handled uniformly. The student community can take more responsibility in research and supervision of winter relief efforts.

Therefore, in the future, telecommunications traffic should pay more attention to construction and seek its development, such as enriching equipment, adopting new types of machinery, recruiting outstanding talents, improving communication efficiency, further comprehensively expanding, penetrating society, and serving the people even in remote areas. With the improvement of the environment and the allocation of human and material resources, we must rely on the continued efforts of all our colleagues to promote its realization.

### A Perspective on Smuggling in South China

[Airmail Report from Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 25th] The problem of smuggling in South China, from the time of restoration to today, two years later, still exists and has not been thoroughly resolved. Although the authorities have made the greatest efforts and used all kinds of positive and negative measures, smuggling has not only not been curbed, but has become more serious day by day. According to the recent report from the Guangdong Customs: from May to October of this year, a total of 2,512 smuggling cases were seized in half a year, with a total value of approximately 20 billion yuan. Compared with the four months in the spring of this year, it increased by about six or seven times. The increase in this anti-smuggling figure is certainly a manifestation of the customs' efforts to combat smuggling, but according to the already seized smuggling figures, there is an average of thirteen or fourteen cases per day, with an amount of more than 100 million yuan per day (not including those that have not been seized). From this, one can imagine the alarming figures of our country's tax revenue losses.

The Main Smuggling Locations

are, of course, in Guangzhou. Because Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong and Macau, and the nearby borders of Bin'an and Zhongshan are connected to Hong Kong and Macau, and there are many ports and branches in the Pearl River Delta, there are probably more than one hundred entrances from Hong Kong and Macau to Guangzhou. Smugglers use this geographical advantage, using both land and water routes, making it impossible for anti-smuggling personnel to defend against. Moreover, in addition to a part of the smugglers who are forced by life and carry some smuggled goods as "water passengers" on their own, the rest are all organized smuggling groups. They have considerable capital and special forces to protect them, and even collude with bandits to transport them on their behalf. In addition to setting up seemingly normal and respectable firms in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macau, they also have special personnel stationed at various transportation stations along the route to communicate information through wireless radio. They also have transportation vehicles such as cars and ships, and they are equipped with considerable armed forces. If they encounter anti-smuggling personnel intercepting them, they will first deliver considerable "gifts" to request passage. If they are not accepted, they are always ready to fight. Unless the anti-smuggling personnel also have considerable strength, who would dare to provoke them? They can only watch them drive away and pretend they didn't see them. Therefore, most of the smuggled goods seized by customs anti-smuggling personnel are the aforementioned scattered smuggled goods carried by individuals. There are not many cases of cracking down on large-scale organized smuggling!

According to investigations by relevant parties: Currently, there are thousands of people coming and going every day engaging in small-scale smuggling on trains, highways, and ships, and there are also three or four hundred organized large and small

smuggling groups

that are frequently active on various transportation lines. They usually smuggle in: cosmetics, pigments, caustic soda, bleaching powder, kerosene, salt, cellophane, cigarettes, western medicine, cloth, etc. The main items smuggled out are food rice, cooking oil, and tung oil, which is used to evade foreign exchange settlement. According to investigations by the Office of the Administrative Yuan: in the past month alone, more than 30,000 dan of rice have been exported through Macau. Therefore, Director Song Ziwen was shocked and furious about this matter. Because the province is experiencing a food shortage, some illegal merchants are smuggling food out of the country for profit, which is a betrayal of conscience. Therefore, he ordered the local teams and the naval military police in Zhongshan and the Guangzhou Railway line to assist the anti-smuggling personnel in strict inspections. Those who are caught will be executed. At the same time, he also negotiated with the Macau government to ask for their assistance. Therefore, the general food smugglers have already become subdued.

In addition, there is another type of smuggler who specializes in smuggling industrial raw materials into the country. Most of those who engage in this business are originally legitimate merchants. Because the allocation of import quotas in South China is too small, many legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises receive allocations from the government that are far from their actual needs. For the sake of their own interests, they do not hesitate to take risks, using black market foreign exchange to

Purchase Raw Materials

and smuggle them in. They even join powerful smuggling groups to resist customs inspections. They do not admit that they are smuggling, but say that this is "underground trade." What they mean is that it is not that they are unwilling to pay taxes, but that even if they pay taxes, the government will not allow them to import. Although they say so, in reality they are engaging in smuggling, and most of these merchants have strong capital. They are helping to increase the strength of the smuggling groups, thus making smuggling even more rampant.

The tariff, now Guangzhou, has become a paradise for smugglers. Smuggling has long become an open secret. Mentioning the two words "smuggling," no one will feel strange or surprised. In teahouses, restaurants, and public places, open discussions of smuggling transactions can be heard everywhere. If this widespread bad phenomenon cannot be curbed, the economic future of the entire country will be unimaginable. According to the observations of experienced people: there are approximately several main reasons why smuggling is so rampant: (1) The impact of the war, the people's lives are difficult; (2) Idle funds are concentrated and have no outlet; (3) The currency value is unstable, and the official exchange rate is too low; (4) Trade controls are too strict; it is impossible to obtain a reasonable quantity of raw materials that are actually needed for import.

Of the Four Reasons

, the most pressing issue that needs to be resolved in South China is the last one. If you want to ask how to curb smuggling in South China, Chairman Song Ziwen already has an answer. He reported at the Provincial Assembly this time and said: "Although the Central Government has signed an anti-smuggling agreement with Hong Kong and ordered the Customs and the Navy to strengthen investigations, if the raw materials needed in this province cannot be imported in reasonable quantities, it will be difficult to completely eliminate smuggling. If this province requests an 18% import quota, if approved by the Central Government, smuggling can be immediately prevented." (Special Correspondent Liang Feng)

### After Zhou Xigou's Execution, Bandits in Cheng Engage in Wanton Retaliation

On the 26th, his body was found in the river in Beicun, Wuguan, with a tragic death. It is heard that this killing was committed by escaped prisoners Tan Bingkun and Xu Yinlin.

### Yanzhou and Zaozhuang - A Journey to Southwestern Shandong

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 24th by Air] Yanzhou is the military and political center of southwestern Shandong. Li Wangtang, the commander of the Xuyan Pacification Zone, and Peng Guodong, the director of the Southwestern Shandong Administrative Office of the Shandong Provincial Government, are stationed here. Peng is capable, honest, and lives a very simple life. His office contains only a bookshelf and a dilapidated three-drawer desk. The windows are papered, and the cold wind penetrates, making one shiver. I asked him why his life was so simple. He told me, "Simplicity allows us to constantly remember the suffering of the vast number of people who are still in dire straits. It makes us naturally feel their pain and work harder for the people." The administrative office governs five administrative commissioner's offices, totaling thirty counties and 11 million people. The local civilian armed forces in each county are generally larger than those in other parts of the province, with at least a thousand rifles, and as many as ten thousand in counties like Tengxian. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of coordination in the past, and unified command has been lacking, which has often allowed bandits to take advantage and defeat them one by one. The current administrative office plans to establish a joint command for security forces to achieve coordinated cooperation. Commander Li resides in the Catholic Church in the city, which houses the largest organ in East Asia. The western part of the Xuyan section is shielded by lakes such as Zhezhan, Dushan, and Nanyang. As long as the communist bandit Zhang Guangzhong's Shandong Military Region forces near Baodu (north of Zaozhuang) and Feng Zhenwu's forces near Culaishan are thoroughly eliminated, the safety of the Xuyan section can be ensured. Lincheng and Yanzhou are the only two cities on the central section of the Jinpu Railway that have not been captured by the communist bandits. The train stations in both places are relatively intact. Twenty-five kilometers east of Lincheng is a branch line leading to Zaozhuang, but currently, the line only reaches Taozhuang due to military influence. Zaozhuang has been plundered by bandits eight times. The sixteen buildings of the Zhongxing Coal Mine, which originally produced over 8,000 tons of coal per day, as well as the Nandajing and Beidajing mines, have all been completely destroyed by the bandits. Currently, there are over 300 small mines outside the walls that are being mined by locals using indigenous methods. Over 90 of these mines are already producing coal, with a daily output of 1,000 to 1,500 tons. In addition, there are over 30 earthen coke ovens. The livelihood of over 60,000 civilians in the mining area depends on these mines. In Taozhuang, Zhongxing also operated small mines using machinery before the war, but they were also destroyed by the bandits. After Zhongxing sent personnel to repair them four months ago, they can now produce 100 tons per day. Once new machinery arrives, they will be able to produce over 1,000 tons per day. Currently, the small mines are mostly being mined freely by the people. Recently, the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company has received approval to reclaim all the mines starting in January of next year. The most pressing issue for the people of Zaozhuang remains the frequent kidnappings and extortions by bandits due to Zaozhuang's proximity to Zhang Guangzhong's bandit stronghold in Baodu. Therefore, how to particularly strengthen and unify the local armed forces in various places has become the most urgent problem to be solved in Zaozhuang. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)

### Changzhou Plans to Build a Tomb for Unnamed Heroes; Monks at Tianning Temple Economize by Eating Porridge

[Our Wujin Dispatch on the 27th] In the summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), the 67th Division of the National Army and the local underground resistance clashed with the Japanese invaders at Jinji Ba in the west of Puhu. After a day of fierce fighting, many brave and loyal soldiers of our army were killed in action. Their remains and loyal bones were all buried at Jinji Ba. Local people, in order to commemorate the martyrs and comfort their loyal souls, have initiated the construction of a tomb for unnamed heroes to commemorate them forever. The funds will be raised from donations from nearby towns such as Houxu and Xiasi, and laborers will be conscripted. The fundraising and labor budgets are expected to be finalized within the Lunar New Year, and construction will begin on an auspicious day in the coming spring. Also, Tianning Temple in our county is the largest Zen Buddhist temple in Jiangnan, owning a vast amount of farmland, making it the largest landlord in Jiangnan. The monastic buildings are magnificent and grand. Usually, there are about three to four hundred monks residing there, with facilities like a Sutra Library, Buddhist Academy, and Buddhist Hospital, all of which are quite substantial. The sounds of chanting and the ringing of bells and drums fill the air, resembling a Buddhist paradise all year round. However, due to the unrest in the surrounding villages in recent times, it has been difficult to collect rents from all the farmland, which has blocked the monks' food supply. They have been forced to practice economy, switching from eating solid rice to thin porridge to sustain themselves.

### Award-Winning College Students of This City Held a Joint Get-Together Yesterday; Speaker Pan and Mayor Wu Both Delivered Speeches; Xinjiang Dance Troupe Participated in the Performance

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee sponsored the first joint get-together of award-winning students from colleges and universities yesterday at 9:00 AM at the Municipal Gymnasium. Mayor Wu, university presidents, guests from all walks of life, representatives of donating organizations, and over two thousand award-winning students from various schools attended (over a thousand more award-winning students were unable to attend due to their participation in yesterday's winter clothing fundraising drive). The Xinjiang Dance Troupe was invited to perform at the gathering. The Central Film Studio dispatched personnel to record news footage.

### Various Sectors Donate Large Sums of Money and Do Not Expect Remuneration

The meeting was presided over by the chairman of the committee, Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, who delivered a speech praising the award-winning students as outstanding youths of the nation. Some come from impoverished families, while others have had their economic resources cut off due to banditry in their hometowns, almost forcing them to discontinue their studies. Continuing their studies is of great significance to the nation and their personal futures. Various sectors of the city have generously donated large sums of money for scholarships, hoping that the recipients will make progress in their studies and achieve success, without expecting any remuneration. Their kindness is deeply touching. Pan said: Today, the nation has begun constitutional governance. After the banditry is quelled, political stability can be achieved, and national production and education can both progress. He hopes that the students will study hard at school to build and overcome everything. Pan's words were sincere and won warm applause from the entire audience. Next, Vice-Chairman Li Ximou reported on the scholarship's income and expenditure.

### An Additional 10 Billion Will Be Raised for the Next Term's Scholarship

Mayor Wu then gave a speech, first stating that the scholarship will continue to be offered next semester, and the total amount to be raised is planned to increase by 10 billion yuan, so that all impoverished students can receive relief. At the same time, based on the experience gained from this semester's implementation, improvements will be made in the technical aspects of fundraising and distribution in the future, and the procedures will be simplified as much as possible to ensure that students at various schools can receive their scholarships before the start of school. If this amount cannot be raised before the start of the next semester, which is before the end of January or early February of next year, the municipal treasury can advance the funds first to achieve timely results. Wu then explained the reasons for the unified fundraising for scholarships, stating that in the past, students from various schools raised funds separately, which scattered their efforts, delayed their studies, and inevitably resulted in uneven distribution and other malpractices. Xie Renzhao from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Huang Jiping from this newspaper (representing donating organizations), Zhu Jingnong, President of Guanghua University, and Ou Yuanhuai, President of Daxia University, then delivered speeches. Zhu and Ou, representing various schools, expressed their gratitude to the donors for the scholarships.

[Shenzhou News Agency] Regarding the issue of tuition fees for colleges and universities in this city next semester, over thirty university presidents recently gathered at the Tsinghua Alumni Association and resolved that the unified grant committee will continue to be organized by each school immediately to handle grant matters for each school next semester. As for tuition standards, a meeting will be convened again on January 15 for discussion.

### Meaningful Gatherings Should Be Held Regularly

Finally, Mo Yanqing, a student at Soochow University, gave a speech of thanks, hoping that scholarships would continue to be offered in the future, and that award-winning students would be closely connected. He stated that this meaningful gathering should be held regularly in the future. After the speech of thanks, entertainment began. After the Yongyan Society performed Kunqu opera, the Xinjiang Dance Troupe performed. The program was wonderful, and the cheers were thunderous. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM. Also, the association distributed 20,000 yuan in snack money to each student at noon yesterday, totaling over 60 million yuan. Upon the suggestion of Fu Tongzeng, a student at Aurora Medical College, the entire group passed a resolution to donate the money to the Winter Relief Committee for the relief of refugees.

[Also Reported] After the meeting yesterday afternoon, the association invited all members of the Xinjiang Dance Troupe to a luncheon on the 14th floor of the International Hotel, where the hosts and guests enjoyed themselves immensely.

### Qingbaiqing Battles Hard to Defeat Railway by One Goal

An Upset Almost Occurred in the First Division Football League

In the First Division of the Third Football League, the match between Qingbaiqing and Railway took place at Yiyuan Stadium yesterday at 2:30 PM. A large crowd of spectators, estimated to be over a thousand, watched the game. 20,315 tickets at 20,000 yuan each and 12,949 tickets at 10,000 yuan each were sold, generating an income of 35,790,000 yuan in legal tender. As a result, Qingbaiqing narrowly won by a score of 1-0 after Qu Yongfu scored a goal in the last half minute. The entire 90-minute match was in a state of tension. Railway performed exceptionally well, especially goalkeeper Liao Xiong, who abandoned his usual "pipa style" and made countless saves. On the Qingbaiqing side, Qin Bigao also performed admirably. Wu Qixiang, Yan Yuxin, Meng Yiliang, and others were also quite diligent. Fei Chunhua's endurance was slightly insufficient, while Luo Shoufu's performance deteriorated rapidly, making him the worst performer of the day.

### The First Half Ended in a Draw

The match began at 2:40 PM. Referee Deng Xiaoliang blew the whistle to start the game. Qingbaiqing's Li Yichen was mistaken for Mao. Qu Yongfu arrived on the field 26 minutes after the start. After joining the game, Qingbaiqing took the offensive first, but Railway's defense was tight and could not be penetrated. After seven minutes, Railway launched a fierce attack. Wu Binghao's corner kick was easily caught by Qin Bigao. Xiao Ziwen also took a corner kick, but it was offside. Before long, Lu Bingsheng fired a long shot from 25 yards, which Qin Bigao parried into a corner kick. Wu Binghao tried again, and Bigao saved it into a corner kick again. Railway could not break through, and Qingbaiqing, after a period of inactivity, attempted a surprise move. Jin Lusheng's shot went wide. At 26 minutes, Qu Yongfu arrived and replaced Xie Shizhan. He was indeed active, but Liao Xiong was especially on his toes, making one dangerous save after another. The first half ended with the two teams tied.

### A-Fu Scores in the Last Half Minute

After the restart, Railway's lineup remained the same. Qu Yongfu moved to center forward, Gao Xiuqing played right forward, Gu Yiseh rested, and Wu Kaimai filled A-Fu's vacant spot. After joining the game, Qingbaiqing planned to flex their muscles. After two minutes, Gao Xiuqing penetrated alone, but unfortunately, he stumbled before the horse and failed to complete the attack. Before long, A-Fu received the ball and shot powerfully, but Liao Xiong slapped it into a corner kick. The area in front of the Railway goal was full of danger. Fortunately, Yue Renxiao and Wu Jiabang defended well, and no ambush was successful. After 25 minutes, Railway became active again. Lu Qingxiang made a small pass down the center, and Xiao Ziwen caught the pass and shot powerfully, but Bigao caught it with his ape-like arms. Qingbaiqing counterattacked. A-Lu and A-Fu advanced side by side, but both shots were saved by Liao Xiong. At 38 minutes, Yue Renxiao fouled outside the 15-yard line. Fei Chunhua squandered the opportunity. At 41 minutes, Renxiao, eager to save the ball, was injured in the chaos and had to retire, replaced by Fei Chunlin. Qingbaiqing took advantage of the opportunity and entered the field directly. Half a minute before the end of the game, Qu Yongfu scored a goal in the chaos. At the end of the statutory time, Qingbaiqing narrowly won by a score of 1-0.

### University Football Divisional Final: Jiaotong University Wins Over Sophomore Division Champion

Defeats Tongji by Two to One

The university football league's sophomore division final, Jiaotong University vs. Tongji University, was held yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at Yiyuan Stadium. Students from both Jiaotong University and Tongji University organized cheerleading squads to support their teams, and the atmosphere was quite enthusiastic. Many students from other schools also attended.

The referee was Fang Rongfu. The two sides engaged in close combat. After four minutes, a Jiaotong University forward collided with a Tongji University player and was injured. At that time, some Tongji University students crossed the barrier and entered the field, hindering the game. After persuasion from all parties, the situation calmed down. Play continued, and Jiaotong University launched a full-scale attack. At the end of the first half, Jiaotong University finally scored, taking the lead by one to zero.

After switching sides, Tongji University launched a counterattack with all its might, and Jiaotong University resolutely defended. Not long after the start of the second half, the Tongji University left fullback committed a handball in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. Jiaotong University scored again, taking the lead by two to zero. Tongji University, having conceded two goals in a row, was unwilling to accept defeat. However, Jiaotong University's defense was tight. Until one minute before the end of the game, Tongji University scored a goal in return, avoiding a shutout. When time ran out, Jiaotong University defeated Tongji University by two to one, winning the sophomore division championship and will hold the championship final with Zhendan, the freshman champion.

### Guangdong Provincial Government to Develop Local Sugar Industry; Decides to Establish Large Sugar Factory in Cooperation with Industrial Corporation and the Resources Commission Taiwan Sugar Corporation

[Reported by our newspaper] It is learned that Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman Song Ziwen, to develop the sugar industry in Guangdong Province, has decided that the Guangdong Industrial Corporation, invested by the Guangdong Provincial Government, will cooperate with the Resources Commission Taiwan Sugar Corporation to establish a large sugar factory in Guangdong, estimated to be worth about US$2 million. The factory's scale will be approximately 500 tons of sugarcane crushed every 24 hours, with a daily sugar production of about 50 tons. Currently, a sugar factory that meets this scale is being selected in Taiwan to relocate all the machinery to Guangdong for installation and crushing. It is reported that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation has sent engineers to Guangdong to investigate, and they believe the situation is quite suitable. Resources Commission Chairman Weng Wenhao and Taiwan Sugar Corporation Chairman Wu Zhaohong will personally go to Guangdong for on-site inspections around January 5th of next year.

### China Trust Bureau Extends Period for Purchasing Goods Arriving with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

After the solution of the percentage increase that should be added to the allocated price for goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange, the China Trust Bureau's purchase procedures have been prepared and can begin immediately. It is recently learned that the validity period of the import permits issued by the Import Management Committee will end this month. The Bureau believes that the validity period is too pressing, and merchants cannot complete the procedures in time, so it has decided to extend the purchase period and has requested the Import Management Committee to extend the validity period of the permits. For these goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange, the Bureau, considering the actual needs, will prioritize the purchase of paper and steel. The percentage increase agreed upon a few days ago is also for paper and steel. The second step is to purchase wood and metals. The percentage increase that should be added is being discussed with relevant parties based on the Bureau's investigation data. For goods applying for purchase, the original importer must go to the Bureau to handle the purchase procedures within two weeks from the date the Bureau notifies the original importer to go to the Bureau for purchase procedures. If the original importer who receives the Bureau's purchase certificate intends to apply for priority purchase of the originally allocated goods by direct users, they must apply for allocation within three weeks from the date of receiving the purchase certificate. Failure to do so will be considered a waiver of the priority purchase right.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Orders Yarn and Cloth Management Committee to Draft Various Detailed Rules

[Reported by our newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After the promulgation of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently ordered Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, to draft the following detailed rules immediately: (A) Detailed Rules for the Unified Purchase of Cotton, (B) Detailed Rules for Processing Spinning, (C) Detailed Rules for Processing Weaving, (D) Detailed Rules for Cotton Cloth Allocation. After the various measures are drafted, they will be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval so that the Committee can officially announce and implement them after its formal establishment.

### Strive for International Market and Promote Real Silk Export

Although American silk prices have plummeted, our government is still trying to export and strive for the international market. According to news from relevant parties, our raw silk export still adopts three methods: Direct export of real silk to India, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Processing export, adopting the original method of the Silk Weaving Export Association, exporting real silk processed into silk fabrics. Exchanging foreign exchange earned from the export of real silk for rayon. Real silk export and processing export both have India as their largest market, but the profits from processing export are the highest. In the future, the focus will still be on processing and weaving silk fabrics. Currently, due to the plummeting American silk prices, the government is particularly active in this regard. Relevant parties are stepping up planning. It is also learned that the planned export of silk fabrics to India next year is 100,000 bolts. Since India has import restrictions, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made representations to the Indian government, hoping to allow the import of 100,000 bolts of our silk fabrics. Also, exchanging foreign exchange earned from silk export for rayon is still profitable.

### Shanghai Industry and Commerce Survey Can Be Published Next Spring

[Reported by our newspaper] The first step of the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' work plan for next year will be to complete the data compilation of the industry and commerce survey of the city and plans to publish it into a book next spring for reference by all sectors of society. The items of machinery equipment and production capacity of each factory in the survey data will be a powerful reference material for the determination of import raw material quotas. The Office hopes to expand the scope of the industry and commerce survey to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions next year. In addition, the allocation and factory construction of Japanese reparations materials for civilian use are all handled by the Office, which is a very arduous task. In addition, the industrial and mining equipment in the UNRRA's post-war relief materials will be managed by the Guidance Office after the Post-War Enterprise Committee determines the sales policy for the civilian factory portion in the future.

### Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, Hosts Banquet for All Committee Members

[Reported by our newspaper] Yuan Liang, Chairman of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, hosted a banquet for all committee members, consultants, and heads of departments at the Li Zha Hotel on the evening of the 27th. During the banquet, Yuan delivered a short speech, stating that in this difficult time, the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth management regulations hopes that everyone will cooperate greatly so that the government can suppress the prices of cotton yarn and cloth and see early success. The banquet ended at around 9:00 PM.

### Cigarettes Rise After More Buying

Yesterday's cigarette market situation saw the market rally again because the cigarette tax increase is about to be realized, and there are rumors that factory prices will follow suit. Furthermore, with looser credit conditions, local demand is very strong, and external buying momentum is also strong. Throughout the day, the trend was that there were a lot of purchases of Senior Service cigarettes, and the price rose by 500,000 to 550,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Capstan cigarettes rose by 250,000 yuan, and the prices of other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and 50-cigarette packages also rose uniformly.

### New Soap Buying Activity

The soap market, a daily necessity, was initially slow, but because dealers had ample funds, there were fewer sales, and the attitude of buyers in the market turned firm. As closing time approached, buying activity picked up, and the market rose. Finally, the price of Gu Ben soap rose to 1,083,000 yuan, an increase of 13,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Jian Dao soap rose by 5,000 yuan. In addition, Guanghua, Xiangmao, Meihua, and other soaps rose by about 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Mei Li brand matches rose sharply by 200,000 yuan, and Fenghuang and Nanjing Ningbo brands also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Candles alone were stable.

### Domestic Triangular Belts Can Now Meet Demand

[Reported by our newspaper] The Shanghai Rubber Tire Manufacturing Industry Association has repeatedly applied to the Import Management Committee's Quota Import Examination Office to import triangular belts to meet the needs of the rubber industry. It is recently learned that the Import Management Committee has twice requested the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Guidance Office to investigate the possible production volume of each factory and the general supply and demand situation to determine whether to approve the import. According to personnel from the Guidance Office, domestic manufacturers have already produced triangular belts. State-owned factories include the Resources Commission's Central Chemical Plant, and private factories include Zhengtai Xinji Rubber Factory, Dalai Industrial Company, Wuzhou Rubber Factory, Shenyi Rubber Belt Factory, and Qingdao Qilu Enterprise Company Rubber Factory. The quality of their products can already meet the needs of general industry.

### Business Briefs

Zhang Jia   was summoned to the central government by telegram and went to Beijing at 8:00 AM yesterday to attend a meeting and ask for instructions on stabilizing the city's finances before and after the New Year.

At 8:00 AM yesterday, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Hankou Financial Administration, flew to Hankou by China National Aviation Corporation plane. The Administration will be established no later than New Year's Day.

### Industrial Representatives to the Japanese Reparations Materials Evaluation Committee Have Been Appointed

[Reported by our newspaper] In the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Evaluation Committee for Japanese Reparations Materials for Civilian Use, it is stipulated that the industrial sector will have two representatives. Wu Yun Chu recently told reporters that the Industrial Association has appointed Zhi Bingyuan and Yu Mingyu as attending committee members. Both have been engaged in the machinery and steel industries for many years and have extensive experience; and since 60% of the Japanese reparations materials are industrial equipment, the selection of these people is very appropriate. As of this time, official notification has not yet been received, but it will be submitted immediately after the Ministry of Economic Affairs' official document arrives.

Regarding the Ministry of Economic Affairs' recently promulgated payment method for private enterprises to purchase reparations materials, Wu believes that it is quite fair in principle. However, some factories suffered losses during the war, so they hope to receive greater preferential treatment.

In addition, regarding Japanese chemical industrial equipment, the Allied countries have previously agreed to dismantle a portion of it as a gift to China. According to Wu's information, the Allied Headquarters no longer intends to include factories for producing nitric   and fertilizer powder as reparations items.

### Overseas Remittances in November Only Half of October's; Detailed Figures Released by the Bank of China

### What About Our Science Plan?

— Liu Xian

Since this publication published Mr. Chenfeng's "Sketch of the British National Physics Laboratory" (Issue 18, December 1st) and Mr. Yang Shi's "American Ten-Year Science Research Plan" (Issue 19, December 8th), it has attracted considerable attention from all parties. We have received many letters from readers who have raised many concerns or questions about science in our country. In general, the main ideas can be divided into two categories: The first category says, "The organization of British scientific research institutions is so perfect, and the work is so intense. Doesn't our country also have the Academia Sinica? Doesn't it also have ten or so research institutes? Heaven, earth, people, culture, animals, plants, mathematics, and physics all have them. The history is also nearly twenty years old, and recently, there was also the election of academicians. It should be able to do some scientific research work for our country like British research institutes to solve our people's livelihood problems and national defense problems..." The main points of the second category are, "American science is so developed, and they still need a ten-year science research plan. Isn't our country calling for resistance against Japan and national reconstruction? It's been more than two years since victory. What about our science plan? We hope that we can also have a ten-year science research plan like the United States..."

All parties are so concerned and pay so much attention to the development of science in our country. This is indeed a progressive and gratifying phenomenon. However, judging from the content of many readers' letters, we feel that most readers do not have enough understanding of the situation of the scientific community in our country and are very estranged. For example, many readers do not know much about the content, organization, and past achievements of the Academia Sinica. They think that with such a lofty scientific research institution, any difficult scientific problems can be solved by them, which is an excessive expectation. Some readers say very bluntly that the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was a great opportunity, and building the country is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. To enrich the country and the people, there is no shortcut but to develop science. They earnestly hope that the government will no longer delay and should formulate a scientific construction plan as soon as possible and respond quickly to the situation. Some say that we can imitate the Soviet Union's five-year plan, and some say that we can follow the example of the United States and have a ten-year plan. These opinions can be said to be appeals. Regardless of when they are realized, they are very valuable.

Now, from the position of our scientists, in addition to fully accepting the valuable opinions provided by the readers of this publication (due to time constraints, we apologize for not being able to reply to each reader's letter individually), for the sake of the country's century-old plan, we must solemnly point out the importance and urgency of the post-war scientific construction plan of our country and hope to arouse the attention of the people of the whole country!

First, since two atomic bombs advanced the end of World War II, the power of science has been fully revealed. We firmly believe that the future development and evolution of the world situation and the progress or destruction of human civilization are actually held by science. To comply with the world trend, we should build scientific undertakings on a large scale to maintain international peace, otherwise, we will inevitably be slaughtered by others.

Second, our country is vast, rich in resources, and has a large population, which is uniquely blessed. However, now the country is poor, the people are suffering, the politics are chaotic, the economy is in danger, and the society is corrupt. The reasons for this are all because science is not flourishing and the people are ignorant. If we plan well to develop resources and focus on research, not only can we be sure to enrich the country and the people, but also politics can be brought back on track, and the declining social atmosphere can be changed.

Third, the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War greatly damaged the national strength, and the people suffered deeply. Fortunately, we gained more help than injustice, and justice triumphed over power, and we won the final victory. The international status has increased. We should cherish this hard-won achievement. Building science is an effective way to increase national power, the only guarantee for enriching national defense, and the only way to maintain international status.

Fourth, scientific research in our country showed considerable development before the Anti-Japanese War. The achievements gradually increased, and the number of talents increased. Given time, it would not be difficult to carry forward and make it great. Unfortunately, the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and things went wrong again. The spring red was crushed, and the summer green was withered. This scientific seedling was almost completely destroyed. We believe that the government should face the needs of this time and place, equip scientific institutions as soon as possible, and provide generous funding. Those that have withered can be revived, and those that have not been established can be created immediately to meet urgent needs and protect the country's life.

Fifth, science in our country is backward, and industry is infantile. To build science, we must first have a detailed plan. Which are basic research, which are practical applications, which should come first, which should come later, how to determine the funding, and how to train talents must all be planned in advance, deployed properly, implemented year by year, and timed to achieve the expected results.

Sixth, at the beginning of constitutional government, everything is renewed. The scientific funding will be greatly increased, which may account for 15% of the total annual expenditure. Before the formal allocation, we should plan ahead, prepare a plan, and make good use of the allocation of funds for the scientific sector.

In short, for the sake of improving people's livelihood, enriching national defense, and contributing to academics, we urgently need to have a perfect science plan to serve as a standard. The scientific community in our country is not lacking in experts and talents with wisdom and foresight, and scientific construction is our duty, and we cannot shirk our responsibility. We hope that everyone will do their best, work together, and express their opinions together to select a scientific construction plan that suits the national conditions. Let us not let the Soviet Union and the United States be the only ones who are beautiful in the front. Fortunately, colleagues in the scientific community at home and abroad will rise up together to plan for it!

### How Pigeons Find Their Way

— Zhi Mei

How do pigeons find their way? This question is what people generally want to ask and answer, but cannot. We often hear about long-distance pigeon races, where pigeons fly from one place to another, or we watch homing pigeon shows. But it's always strange how they can fly to their original home from unfamiliar places. Many scientists also consider this a mystery, unable to figure out the reason. It wasn't until September of this year that this difficult question was answered, discovered by H. L. Yeagley, an American physicist who has been engaged in research at the U.S. Army Pigeon Research Institute since the beginning of World War II.

When Yeagley began his research, he hypothesized that pigeons could sense the Earth's magnetism. He experimented using the following method: He used several pigeons and tied a small magnet to each of their wings, creating a small magnetic field to disrupt the Earth's magnetic lines. As a result, after these pigeons were released, they all got lost, while those pigeons without magnets all flew back. Yeagley thus proved that pigeons must be able to sense the Earth's magnetism.

However, relying solely on magnetic sensitivity is not enough for flight, because magnetic force gradually increases from the equator to the poles. Although a pigeon can distinguish the strength of the magnetism at its own home, it could potentially circle the Earth within an equal magnetic force line and still get lost. Therefore, we realized that there must be another force related to it.

Yeagley hypothesized that this force is called the Coriolis force, which is generated by the Earth's rotation and is related to latitude. The force is weaker at the equator and stronger at the poles. Yeagley also experimented with his ideal, using a map with latitude lines, on which he drew equal magnetic lines. Logically, since both latitude and equal magnetic force lines gradually increase from the equator to the poles, they should be parallel. However, because the geographic poles and magnetic poles are not in the same location, and the equal magnetic lines are slightly curved and not perfectly circular, the two lines often intersect at certain points. At these two points, the strength of magnetic force and Coriolis force is completely different. If a pigeon is released from a certain place, some might fly to one point, and others to the other. Fortunately, these two intersection points are usually outside the pigeon's flight range, so pigeons can usually fly back to their old home, that is, fly to the closer sensing point within their flight range.

Yeagley found on the map that the city of Kearney had the same magnetic force and Coriolis force as his hometown of Pensylvania (in the central United States). If his idea was correct, then putting the pigeons he trained in P city in another unfamiliar place near K city might be guided to K city by that same magnetic force and Coriolis force. So he built a new nest in K city, and released the tested pigeons a few miles away. As a result, those pigeons all arrived at their new nest. Thus, he proved that pigeons rely on a special sense of magnetism and sensitivity to find their way.

### Submersible Jeep

— Zheng Zuoqing

The submersible jeep can go six feet deep into the water, with almost the entire vehicle submerged. If it weren't for the top of the engine needing to stay above the water, it would truly be a real submarine. The car was designed by the U.S. Navy to be amphibious for combat. Its appearance is exactly the same as an ordinary land jeep, but it is equipped with one hundred and twenty-five special components, including a waterproof ignition system, an extended exhaust pipe device, and a "breathing" pipe that extends above the water. The driver must wear a diving suit, except for the diving helmet. The four wheels of the vehicle are engraved with paddle-like patterns, so after jumping into the water, it can also turn freely, and the speed is not inferior to that on land. According to a Navy spokesperson, if the vehicle had been used earlier in the war, many lives would have been saved in beach invasion battles and forced crossing battles.

### "Poison Gas"

— Zhao Zhen

When we talk about "poison," we have a sense of fear, feeling that "poison" is harmful to us. But we need to know, what exactly is "poison"?... Usually, when our bodies are attacked, the nervous system can easily make us feel pain and discomfort. However, after a short time, the cells and tissues in our body recover and no longer feel pain; but we are often unknowingly "poisoned." When the injury expands—when the tissues in our body are corroded by "poison" and undergo drastic changes—only then do we realize that we have encountered "poison." For example, on a cold winter night, in a room where the windows are closed so tightly that air cannot circulate, if a stove is lit, we often see in the newspaper the tragic news of the whole family dying. Indeed, "poison" is truly frightening. There are many poisonous substances. If they are in solid or liquid form, we can easily detect them. But when they are in a gaseous state, they mix into the air, following the flow of air and coming into contact with our bodies everywhere. At this time, we are unknowingly knocked down by "poison gas." Therefore, among poisonous substances, "poison gas" is the most terrible—"poison gas" can hide its face, thus making us unable to defend against it; and the space it invades is unlimited. It can move with the wind, sweeping across humanity everywhere.

In World War I, Germany manufactured many kinds of "poison gas" as a military weapon: Phosgene was the first "poison gas" used—an unstable gas formed by the combination of carbon monoxide and chlorine gas; and it is heavier than air. So when a cloud of "poison gas" blows over, it densely covers the ground, so even soldiers hiding in trenches or in poorly equipped bunkers cannot escape its invasion. When this cloud fills the area around you, it immediately causes your death—because at this time, the air around you has been displaced by it, and you can no longer get air supply; however, once you inhale this gas, it begins to decompose; as a result, not only does it bleach the lungs, but all the hemoglobin in the blood flowing in various parts of the body can be reduced and thus destroyed. Then, all the respiratory organs lose their function. Of course, at this time, you will definitely be suffocated to death. The victim's limbs are pale gray, indicating a state of extreme struggle; it is truly pitiful. So the name of this gas is very grimly called "Phosgene." Mustard gas is also a very terrible type of "poison gas." In the battle of the Somme, many people in Paris were injured and killed by it; they first developed blisters on their skin, which gradually swelled, and finally even the skin and flesh cracked, severely corroding the muscles of the body. For a time, there was no way to treat it, and within just 24 hours, the dead left only a complete skeleton.

We are all afraid of this kind of "poison gas"; but we need to know that there are many kinds of poison gas, and each has its special properties to stimulate various human organs. For example, Chlorpicrin and Benzyl-chlprioce, one called a diffusive "poison gas," and ciphenylchor-arsine gas, which stimulates the nasal passages, as well as laughing gas, can all be fatal. There are now hundreds of types of "poison gas" discovered, so the development of science brings a kind of cruelty to humanity; but we cannot therefore abandon science; we must remedy China's crisis and start with science. The promotion and development of China's science truly requires us to discover it!

### The Science of Perming Hair

— Jia Ling

Perming hair is modern, and women are most concerned about these three thousand strands of worry. They can skip meals, but they can't skip doing their hair. Although European noblemen also wore curled hair in the Middle Ages, there are no records of curled hair in our country's history. So trying to find a sentence in ancient books to describe the beauty of curled hair is impossible. Perming hair is originally a Western civilization!

The hairdresser first carefully washes your hair clean, removing grease and oil, and cuts it to a suitable length. Then, they apply a "lotion" and curl it in electric clips to bake it into a curly shape. The main ingredient of the so-called "lotion" is sodium sulfite, with the addition of borax, ammonia, or carbonates.

Originally, the protein in our hair is Keratin, which contains 15% Cystine. Those who have studied chemistry know that a Cystine molecule is formed by two amino acids linked by two sulfur atoms. These constantly crisscrossing Cystine chains give hair its unique shape and properties. If the -S-S- chain of Cystine is broken, then the hair can be changed into any curl and shape, no longer adhering to its original form.

Therefore, we use weak alkaline substances such as borax and ammonia, and reducing sulfites to destroy the molecular structure, and with the help of heat and mechanical force, accelerate the chemical reaction to complete the mission of curling hair.

Why does hot curling not last?

Before electric perms were invented, everyone used curling irons for "hot curling," using heat to make the hair comply. Because there is only a physical effect and no chemical change, "hot curling" does not last. After two or three days, the hair completely returns to its original appearance.

American scientists are happy to serve women, and after nylon stockings, they invented "cold perms" to replace cream electric perms. This kind of cold perm does not require electricity or a perm machine. It can be done anywhere, anytime, simply, conveniently, and safely.

Cold Wave

You don't have to rush to the barber shop or beauty salon. You can just buy two kinds of hair curling lotions at home and start cold perming. After washing your hair, using the first lotion will make it automatically curl up, allowing you to create any style you want. Then, use the second lotion to fix it. Beautiful and novel curled hair is produced. Finally, you wash away the remaining lotion, and the "cold perm" is complete. This kind of hair curling lotion is already manufactured by several cosmetics companies in the United States, and it will soon be smuggled to Shanghai!

To put it bluntly, this trick is not mysterious at all. The first lotion contains Ammonium Thiglycollate, which can reduce -S-S- to two -SH Cysteines. And the second lotion is just acidified hydrogen peroxide, oxidizing Cysteine back into Cysteine, but the arrangement of the positions is changed, so a lasting and stable curl is produced.

Science Ramblings

### Nutrition (Part 1)

Human life constantly needs food. On average, each person consumes about fifty tons of food in their lifetime, and roughly every seventy pounds of food are needed to grow one pound of body mass. This food can be said to be a raw material for building the body, and also a fuel for generating energy. The food we consume every day contains an average of 3000 potential calories, and the body then converts this potential energy into kinetic energy in a corresponding proportion (healthy people convert approximately 30-40% of potential energy into kinetic energy, which is similar to the mechanical efficiency of higher plants, and is four times the efficiency of ordinary automatic machinery) for use in work.

Looking at ordinary foods, when carbohydrates and proteins undergo oxidation in the body, each gram can generate four calories of heat, and fat can generate nine calories of heat. Water constitutes most of the weight of food and does not produce much energy, but it has a great effect on physiological functions.

In addition to this, humans often store the food they consume for future needs, so a strong and muscular person can maintain life without food for a period of one to two months. This is because their body tissue contains at least 7500 potential calories. This amount of energy is enough to sustain a person at rest for up to seventy-five days.

The raw materials of our food, as mentioned above, can usually be divided into four major categories: protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals. Foods like barley, wheat, rice, and white sugar are all so-called carbohydrates, and their main function is to generate energy. Fat probably interacts with carbohydrates in the body's metabolic processes. In healthy individuals, approximately 40-50% of the energy in the total food intake comes from carbohydrates, and 30-35% comes from fat. Moreover, fat often forms a protective layer around nerves, acting like a cushion to prevent sudden shocks to the nerves. We see that people who are hungry are often easily irritated, which is because there is a lack of fat around the nerves. The function of fat is not limited to this. If the diet lacks fat, our body cannot obtain those fat-soluble vitamins, and therefore there will be great physiological dangers. Although our body can usually produce fat from carbohydrates, many fats that cannot be produced have to be obtained from other animals, so we should not oppose eating more meat, but rather value it.

Protein is the essential element of protoplasm that forms the cellular part of life. Its molecules are very complex, but they are only composed of a few elements. Most proteins contain 51-55% carbon, 70% hydrogen, 20-23% oxygen, 1.55-2% sulfur, and some proteins contain trace amounts of phosphorus or iron. Ordinary plants can combine amino acids to form life-sustaining proteins, and animals then use these amino acids to make their own body proteins, but animals cannot create amino acids from simple elements like plants can. From this, it can be seen that animals cannot live without plants. It has now been determined that approximately twenty-one amino acids exist in natural proteins. If an animal is healthy, it must have at least some of these twenty-one amino acids in the food it eats. These twenty-one amino acids can chemically form at least 2,432,902,176,640,000 kinds of proteins or protein-like compounds, of which hundreds have been confirmed by research, and over a thousand are known to exist in nature.

Current research results prove that the condition for good health requires at least 50% minerals. This amount is the minimum requirement for a healthy person. According to this standard, each adult must obtain 0.86 grams of calcium per day. If the calcium intake exceeds this number, their health will be further improved. The reason for ingesting calcium is because our bones and teeth are constantly being corroded, and new molecules replace old molecules. Thus, the body continuously metabolizes and replaces calcium both internally and externally. Usually, all the calcium in our body is completely renewed every six years. If the calcium intake is insufficient at this time, the body must take calcium from the bones and teeth to make adjustments. If this happens, the body will suffer greatly!

The roles of phosphorus and calcium in the human body are like the relationship between electricity and light. Both are essential raw materials for forming teeth and bones. Within three years, our intake of phosphorus should be at least twice that of calcium. However, most of our food contains phosphorus, which is usually more abundant than calcium, so this is not a problem.

The iron content in the human body can only make a nail worth ten pennies. Although the content is not much, there is fundamentally no blood if there is no iron in the body. The blood of higher animals contains iron-bearing hemoglobin, and the so-called "anemia index" is determined by looking at the hemoglobin content. Every day, 8% of the blood cells in our body are destroyed. If there is no compensation from the iron in food, then the number of blood cells will become abnormal and cause anemia.

### Talking About Old Age

— Ji Yong

Foreign countries respect the elderly. Presidents are almost all over fifty years old, indicating that by this age, their experience and ability have reached the peak of perfection. When in power, they can handle things with ease. That is why there is the saying that forty is the beginning of life. We see the nearly ninety-year-old Bernard Shaw still constantly publishing his amazing masterpieces, and the over-seventy-year-old Winston Churchill is also full of vigor. Even as Atlee's Labour Party policies are on the verge of collapse, this old hero is still raring to go, preparing to win back the glory of the sun never setting on the British Empire for Great Britain. As for the white-bearded Stalin, he is even more astute, holding the fate of the world in his hands for the last hundred years.

However, this is not so common in the East. Someone in Japan said, "At forty, one should still be ashamed to be alive, for being of no benefit to others, nor of any benefit to oneself, it is truly better to die." This statement is certainly based on some truth, but the target of this satire must certainly be old people over forty. Although Confucius said that at thirty one establishes oneself, at forty one is no longer perplexed, and only at seventy does one follow one's heart's desires without transgressing the boundaries, in general, perhaps it is precisely at these ages that people are more perplexed and more likely to transgress the boundaries, and therefore cannot truly "establish" themselves. Even Confucius himself did not say, "When they are old, they must be cautious of greed," and "If one is not known at forty or fifty, then one is not worth fearing!" Not worth fearing is a small matter, seemingly passively unrelated to society. This greed, however, is truly China's fatal flaw. No matter how one cautions against it, it never works. On this point, we feel that the traditional Chinese advocacy of respecting the elderly needs to be discussed. The age requirements for civil servants should also be reconsidered.

Look, is "mature and prudent" ultimately good or bad? "Cunning and sly" is even more impolite, "decrepit and muddleheaded" is worse, and "abusing one's age" makes people avoid them for three days, while the phrase "senile" can almost encompass everything. Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" bemoans the conflict between generations. Whether we are young or old, we generally sympathize with the next generation. But when we actually have children, we forget the sufferings of our youth, and can never reconcile with the second generation on matters such as marriage and ideology. Therefore, some people advocate that one must keep a diary, not for any other reason, but so that when your child asks to go to the park and you lose your temper and refuse, you can flip through the diary and see "I want to go to the park," which will then set you at ease. Then, the diary is also the basis for repaying debts, allowing us to eliminate the identity of the creditor and become the debtor.

The strangest thing is that contradictions always exist within one person. The person who advocates concubinage today is the same zealous advocate of women's rights in the past, and the person who advocates filial piety as the greatest virtue and emphatically composes poems on the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars can also be the hero who single-handedly attacked the Confucian shop. What I say is that the elderly in the East are not good examples, mainly because of this. The biblical proverb that always advocates respecting the elderly probably exists because people generally do not sincerely respect them? I have always believed in Xunzi's words: "If one has it within, one will not seek it without." To demand respect for the elderly is due to disrespect for the elderly. Not only is there disrespect for the elderly, but it also seems that everyone believes that having reached a certain age, one can take a rest and not have to compete with the younger generation. Therefore, when Ma Yuan strikes his saddle and mounts his horse, his eyes shining with pride, is it not often met with ridicule from later generations, perhaps something like "shameless old man"? Since the Qin and Han dynasties, local autonomous personnel have been called the Three Elders of the Village, which is roughly equivalent to today's local tyrants and evil gentry. In my estimation, honest and useless farmers will inevitably suffer at their hands. These people are probably not less than forty years old. Some people say that "Three Elders and Five Watchmen" is actually "Three Elders and Five Old Men."

The path of life is full of hardships, and the origin of these hardships is mostly related to old age. When young, one is tripped by a stone, and later one turns into a stone to trip others. Why not throw the stone far away, or put it in the river or swamp to provide footing for others? As the year ends and age increases, one simply grows a year older. I am cautioning myself, and also cautioning others.

### Ghosts and Monsters

— Yu Yuan

A few days ago, I read a very interesting story in an old English magazine. It said that in a certain city in the United States, there was a doctor who was quite famous. In the quiet of the night, he was dissecting a corpse alone. Just as he was getting into the dissection, suddenly, the corner of the corpse's mouth twitched and burst into laughter! The doctor then fainted. When people found him the next day, he had already left this world. This incident immediately aroused people's surprise and attention. Many doctors, in pursuit of the truth, then reopened the strange corpse for dissection. Finally, they unraveled the mystery. It turned out that people have a laughter nerve. In people who have just died, their laughter nerve still has some function. When the corpse was dissected, it was unintentionally touched, and the corpse emitted a terrifying laugh.

If this happened in our China, then the doctor's dissection room would definitely be crowded by crazy people. The "monster-making" corpse might be taken away or rented by someone with a business sense to open some kind of exhibition, selling tickets and running advertisements to make a fortune. The doctors probably wouldn't have the courage to come back and dissect it, and the newspapers would be filled with this news for half a month.

Isn't that right? We can often hear some news about "strange fires" and the like, and even implicitly suggest that there are "fox spirits" causing trouble. In fact, such phenomena can be explained scientifically as a chemical change of spontaneous combustion. Some things can slowly react with oxygen in the air at ordinary temperatures. If this thing is placed in a poorly ventilated place, then its temperature gradually increases, and it burns when it reaches the ignition point. For example, a carpenter carelessly leaves a cloth soaked in paint oil under the floor or on the ceiling. Over time, the phenomenon of spontaneous combustion occurs—of course, the "Great Immortal Fox" has shown its spirit again!

When people have suspicious events, they try their best to study them and pursue the truth, but we are not like that. Are magical ghost stories such as corpse driving and summoning still around? Some people deliberately exaggerate some small things to make them vivid in order to find excitement. Some people may know the "mystery" in it, but are unwilling to explain it clearly and spoil the fun. Still others cling to preconceived ideas and do not ask about the truth or falsehood; and others want to show off their erudition in front of others, so they boast and deceive people by wildly exaggerating. In this way, the truth disappears, and ghosts and monsters are everywhere.

### Lying

— Ze Shi

This morning I told my young son to go and collect the household rice ration coupons, but he returned empty-handed near noon, saying they could only be collected in the afternoon. In the afternoon, I went to the oil shop myself, but they said they wouldn't be issued until next week. I asked where the afternoon claim came from, and they replied, "Probably your son was lying." I was furious, and gave the lying child a good beating. Still angry, I wandered around a nearby used bookstore to relax. After looking around for a while, I suddenly saw a small book called "Speaking of Lies in Wartime," written by a famous British lord.

Opening it up, the first thing I saw was a clever quote about lying cited by the author, such as "In wartime, the first casualty is truth." "You know that war is supported by a kind of argument that, after the war is over, people realize should never have been listened to." "It is easier to make money with lies than with honesty." The author also said in the preface, "Lying is a publicly recognized and very useful weapon of war." This book was first published in 1928, and the material in it was naturally collected from the last World War, which seems inevitably outdated, but it still came out in its eighth edition in January 1940, indicating that it may contain materials that later generations can learn from. Fortunately, the original price was only two shillings and sixpence, and now that it has fallen into the used bookstore to be sold, I don't think the price will be too high, so I asked the owner for the price.

"Forty thousand yuan."

"What!"

"Forty thousand is not expensive. Even if you buy old paper by the pound, it's worth that much. If you don't buy it today, the price will change tomorrow."

"Change to twenty thousand?"

"At least sixty thousand!"

I knew he was telling a complete lie, but the book clearly says "It is easier to make money with lies than with honesty." Since the used bookstore aims to make money, and easy money is the best strategy, how can I blame him for lying? And in all fairness, the price of books is actually the cheapest among all goods. Today, a better pack of cigarettes costs more than 30,000 yuan, and a better movie costs around 20,000 yuan. The result of a pack of cigarettes is twenty cigarette butts and a small jar of ashes. The remaining value of a movie is a description (which costs extra money). As for books, even if they cost 40,000 yuan each, after reading them, regardless of whether they contain a golden house or the beauty of jade, broadly speaking, they can be lent to friends and passed on to descendants, and narrowly speaking, they can be returned to the original store for multiple profits (if they can be hoarded for three and a half months). Since the Chinese people's skill in calculation is internationally renowned, and the Chinese people's respect and cherishing of written paper has a long history, then, at a time when the price of books is far below that of all other goods, the publishing industry should be unprecedentedly prosperous. Who knew that the reality is not the case? Nowadays, the Chinese people's attitude towards books seems to be somewhat like Confucius's attitude towards ghosts and gods—respectful but distant.

To tell the truth, I didn't buy the wartime lying collection either, because the bookstore owner kept shaking his head when I offered 30,000 yuan, and in a fit of anger, I left. On the way home, I bought two oranges for my son who I had beaten for lying. When comforting him, I told a lie, saying, "I met Uncle He on the road, and he gave you these two oranges." In fact, the truth I wanted to say was, "You promising child, you will definitely be very good at making money in the future, because you can lie. You have hope of entering the political arena in the future, because you can lie: there is a reward for liars!"

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Six: Such a Wonderful Night (28)

Zhu Erxi said happily: "So, you didn't want to leave Beiping, because I didn't come back, so you wrote the letter like that, right? I'm really sorry, I couldn't find time to come back because the task wasn't finished." Qi Wan said sternly: "No, I really want to leave, I have to leave." When Qi Wan said this, her face immediately darkened, and then she blurted out: "This time I was in the hospital recovering from my injury, and the outside world didn't pay much attention. After I came back, there were many rumors, especially that Lin, who came to me to pester me again and again, which added many idle talks to the outside world. My family is torn apart, and there is also a reaction. I am suffering from internal and external attacks, and I really want to leave this place to avoid it for a while. Last year, someone invited me to Dankou, but my father didn't agree, so it was cancelled. Now, someone has invited me, my brother, and the troupe to perform in Jinan. My brother and everyone else agree, but my father won't let me go. He won't say why, he just firmly says, 'If you go, I can't live!' I think it's a pity not to go, and the payment is quite satisfactory, so I repeatedly begged my father, but my father refused. I asked my father to explain why I couldn't go, and if we thought we really couldn't go, we wouldn't go. My father said, 'It's nothing, if you're not afraid of something happening, then go. Once you leave Beiping, it won't be easy to see me again.' My brother and I both felt that the old man was too worried, and declared that Jinan was not far from Beiping and nothing would happen. We had already arranged everything, so we shouldn't miss the opportunity. Just these few words made the old man slap the table. He shouted directly, 'None of you children listen to me, so why bother asking! Since everyone is like this, I don't care about anything, I'm old and annoying!' He yelled 'I don't want to live! I can't live!' He kicked over the box, took out his leather coat and leather hat, lit a fire and burned them. My brother apologized repeatedly to calm him down. He was angry all day that day, and fell ill with a fever that night. I am suffering from criticism from my colleagues outside, and such misunderstanding at home, and I am so anxious that I have nowhere to go. Later, Zhu Shichuan gave me an idea and asked my father's old friend Wang Shoushan to come forward and slowly persuade my father. He finally agreed to let my brother and I go back the day before yesterday, and my younger brother and his wife stayed in Beiping to take care of the old man. I was busy contacting all parties, and everything was finally prepared. I'm leaving early tomorrow morning. I wanted to see you before I left, so I wrote to tell you." As Zhi said this, she felt sad and uncomfortable, her eyes were full of tears, which were in her eyesockets, almost falling down, and she tried her best to hold back, looking at Zhi Zhai. At this time, Little Wang Ma pushed the door in, brought two bowls of lotus root noodles and two dishes of side dishes, and placed them on the table, to have a simple meal.

### Money Also

— Wang Baili

The Tang Dynasty's Prince Xiao Gong of Hejian was young, calm, and perceptive, and grew up to conquer all sides, achieving success wherever he went. He once said to someone: "My residence is quite magnificent, but it is not what I want. I always build another area that is just enough to serve the purpose. After I die, if my son is talented, he can easily keep it; if he is not talented, it will not be used by others," and so on. This is the same as the words of Shu Guang in the Han Dynasty, "If a wise man has too much wealth, he will damage his ambition; if a foolish man has too much wealth, he will increase his mistakes. Moreover, the rich are resented by the public. Since I have no way to teach my descendants, I also do not want to increase their mistakes and cause resentment." Their vision and understanding were truly outstanding and the same throughout. The Southern History says: "After Wang Zhen'e pacified Guanzhong, his prestige shook the master, and he collected a lot of women, jade, and silk. The emperor thought he had great merit and let him be. At that time, someone said that Zhen'e had different ambitions, and the emperor secretly sent someone to observe him, and saw that he was only recording the gold and silver in the army treasury, and discarding the jade on the side of the wall. The emperor said, 'Zhen'e loves gold and silver, so it can be known that he has no long-term ambitions.' His heart was at peace." This is clear evidence that money can damage ambition. Originally, money is a circulating currency in society. It is enough to have enough to eat and use. What is the benefit of having more! Like Zhou Kui, the Earl of Jiading, and the eunuch Wang Zhixin in the late Ming Dynasty, when Li Zicheng's army approached the capital, Emperor Chongzhen asked them for help. Zhou Kui said he didn't have any, and Wang Zhixin was the richest, but he only donated 10,000 taels of gold, and the rest was not a penny. Later, when the capital was captured, these people were arrested, tortured, and forced to donate gold. They were never satisfied, and they were still tortured. As a result, Wang Zhixin was tortured and forced to donate 150,000 taels of gold, and Zhou Kui was confiscated 520,000 taels of silver, Chen Yan 30,000 taels of silver, 3,000 taels of gold, and three dou of pearls, and the others more or less. At that time, unable to bear the torture, Wei Yu, Fang Yuegong, Qiu Yu, and others all committed suicide. I think if these wealth had been donated to the army at that time, things would have been successful in every way, but Zhou and others were inherently stingy and unwilling to give it up. They only "obediently" showed it after the bandits came to use torture. Wei and others did not commit suicide until they could not bear the torture. It is truly what is called "only knowing that wealth is a disaster when dying." According to the Southern History's Book of Qi, Emperor Donghun was immoral. When Xiao Yan's army entered, he was repeatedly defeated, but he still asked for rewards from above. Ru Fazhen kowtowed to argue, and he replied, "Did the thief come only to take me? Why do you call me to ask for things!" When historians write about this, it is truly laughable! Yuan Jianzhai wrote in a poem: "Everything is lovely, but money is the best interest; you can't invite it when you're alive, you can't take it with you when you die." I would like to tell the wealthy gentlemen that you should think things through and not get stuck in the eyes of copper coins.

Illustrated Chongqing Storytelling

### An Example of Fighting

— Bai Wuwen Long Sheng Jin

For example, if someone asks me what is the most serious social problem in Chongqing society, besides eating, I will open any day's local edition of the newspaper and point it out to him: news about "fighting" accounts for more than 10%.

The phenomenon of fighting did not start today, but today it has developed to a fever pitch; if we say that the people are valiant, Sichuan is not counted, initially, only in Jiaochangkou there were people "fighting with hammers" (Chongqing dialect: mutual or group fighting) every day, because that is the concentration of "airplanes" (Chongqing dialect: hooligans); hooligans are professional hammer fighters, not fighting is an accident, but today, there are clearly many amateur fighters.

The ones who often fight with hammers are the coolie porters, fighting to compete for work opportunities, it is not surprising to fight, the competition is so sharp.

The ones who fight every day are the theaters, there is little porridge and many monks, if they are not allowed to come in to see the show for free, they resort to fighting, and the employees who "hold the fence" in front of the theater are those who can withstand fists.

What is strange is that the fighting trend has actually entered schools: students in the physical education department of Chongqing University injured as many as seventeen classmates because one classmate jokingly called them a circus troupe.

A judge of a Chongqing local court beat the clerk in the office, which is clearly a psychological influence of hearing too many cases of interrogation and abuse, people who hear too many plays often become good actors, and unknowingly start singing.

It is not uncommon for children to fight in the streets and alleys, and for deaths to occur.

A few days ago, I saw two people wrestling in Liziba, moving in a cowboy posture, one hitting the other's lower body, and the other falling down to trip the other with their feet, the technique was quite skilled, although the skin was broken and bleeding profusely, it was not practice or just playing around. The most wonderful thing is that one was wearing a big plate hat, and the other was wearing a leather jacket, as if deliberately pretending to be a cowboy from the American West.

This is naturally due to the release of widespread depression, but it is also somewhat due to the awareness of superiority, bullying the weak, and bullying the few, although hammer fighters do not have to be Nietzsche's philosophical believers, but the mood to eat you is there, so everything is resorted to force. I heard that national mental health experts have held meetings to discuss, I wonder if there has been a review and conclusion on this "holy land fighting trend"? If not, I would like to contribute a word——卍".

### The Death of Old Pu

— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion

In the past, I heard that Cai Yuanpei said before his death that he was willing to have his body dissected for medical research after his death to discover pathology and benefit future generations. The enthusiasm and insight of the great philosopher are naturally different from vulgarity.

Zhang Pu was upright and bright throughout his life, with a great personality. The circumstances of his death have something worth studying in terms of hygiene. He fell ill very suddenly and passed away too quickly, so he had no last words, and he may not have considered this, but Lao Pu had a spirit. He will certainly agree with the following description as not being wrong, and approve of it.

According to the Tianjin Republic Daily Telegraph, Lao Pu had been working diligently for days to review the list of Legislative Yuan candidates, without any rest. Therefore, he woke up particularly late on the 15th, had breakfast at the party headquarters, went to the Party History Compilation Committee at noon, and then went to the party headquarters in the afternoon for a meeting, and then went to the President's office to discuss matters. After returning home, he reviewed documents and had dinner, eating one more bowl of rice than usual. Not long after dinner, he shouted with abdominal pain. One doctor did not come because it was late at night, and another doctor came, but the person was already dying. The initial diagnosis was appendicitis, but later it was said that "he ate something bad"!

Eating is to maintain health, but it backfired and even became fatal. I will now cite an incident in Beiping as proof.

Two rickshaw pullers, after pulling passengers for a day, earned a lot of money. They were very happy to have dinner at a cake stall. One of them ate a lot. The other made an agreement with him, saying, "If you have the ability to eat five pounds of big cakes at once, today is my treat!" He happily agreed, and ate greedily, finishing everything in an instant. The other paid as agreed and said goodbye. At first, the one who ate felt bloated, then he felt a tightness in his internal organs, and finally he suffered painfully, suffocated, and died. Some say that it was because he could not be treated at night, or that the poor had no money to hire a doctor. But suppose the doctor arrived, what would he do? Because this is an unusual disease, and it is not an acute disease. There is no disease name and no diagnosis case. Surgery cannot be performed for a tumor: this is not a tumor. Arsenic cannot be used happily: this is not arsenic.

It is human nature for Lao Pu to be busy all day and return home for a full meal. His family did their best to call for a doctor and seek help, and the doctor's inability to treat him was also a fact. Explaining that "he ate something bad" is a master of this field, and does not fall into the usual clichés of flattery and perfunctory treatment. In short, there is nothing to complain about this matter. If viewed as a disease, it was completely unexpected. Even if one is careful about diet, who has the time to plan everything perfectly when "those who are busy are easily fed"?

However, combining the above two matters for reference, so that future generations will remember this: "Busy people are easily hungry, and should not eat quickly, and even more should not overeat." This will create immeasurable benefits, and is even more effective than donating the body for anatomical research. Daily life is extremely easy to overlook.

### The Greatness of the World

— Xin Meng

In the American island state of De Teiborg, a woman, when she was 100 years old, lively jumped ten times in a row the Polish "er-de-zi" dance.

In Washington, there is a wealthy old man who, at the age of 102, got a job in a machine shop.

In Teibosuo, England, an old man, at the age of 104, worked as a traveling salesman for a model rack shop, traveling to and from various places.

Social Services

### "Poor Women's Delivery Assistance" Group Expanded Hui Production Gynecology Hospital Joins the Cooperation All Poor Pregnant Women Can Apply Starting in January Next Year

I remember there is an ancient saying that "the shape of newly created things must be simple," then the "Poor Women's Delivery Assistance Movement" also conforms to the meaning of this sentence. In February this year, under the urgent need of objective conditions, this movement was hastily included in the "Social Services" item of this newspaper. At that time, due to the limitations of manpower and material resources, this movement could only be promoted at a slow speed. We used limited strength to serve poor women. For the past ten months, colleagues have been working hard and constantly learning, and at the same time constantly encouraging themselves. We have adhered to the ancient motto of "where there's a will, there's a way," and worked hard to protect the young sprout that was born not long ago, so that it slowly grows stronger! At the beginning, only Renhe Hospital cooperated with us, and only two or three pregnant women were helped each month, but today, the number of cooperating hospitals has increased to four, and more than 50 pregnant women benefit each month. Starting from January 1 next year, Hui Production Gynecology Hospital at No. 167 Huangjiasha, Dananmen, Nanshi will also join the group to serve poor pregnant women. The application procedures are still the same as the simple rules that have been cooperated with the four hospitals in the past. We hope that in the near future, the "Poor Women's Delivery Assistance" cooperative hospitals can announce that they will cover every part of the city, so that every poor woman who is unable to give birth can receive scientific delivery and new-style medical care, which is a most beneficial act for the people.
