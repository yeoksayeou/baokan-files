### Tightening Currency and Relaxing Controls: New Economic Plan Under Review; Property Tax Collection Also Under Careful Study

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Premier Zhang recently stated in a written response to inquiries from senators, "The Executive Yuan has drafted a plan for the entire economic reform issue and is submitting it to the National Government for review." According to an authoritative source, while the economic reform plan has been drafted, certain details still need to be studied. Before the plan is implemented, the current economic and financial policies will continue to follow the following two principles: (1) Tightening the currency supply, including reducing the amount of currency issued and contracting the amount of loans; (2) Relaxing controls to gradually reduce the controls on production and all other industries.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The authorities are thoroughly reviewing the emergency economic measures, with particular emphasis on balancing the budget. Regarding the expenditure side, the plan stipulates reducing all unnecessary expenditures, but there are many aspects worth considering in terms of implementation. For example, the state's expenses for grain collection agencies are estimated at 760 billion, but the income is very small, and the cost is not much cheaper than purchasing in the market. Therefore, some people advocate returning 30% to local governments and allowing them to collect it themselves, which could save at least several hundred billion. In terms of administrative expenses, the expenses of some local tax authorities are higher than the amount of tax revenue collected. To reduce financial administrative costs, some people advocate restoring the past contract system. Regarding military spending, the number of troops seems excessive. Some experts suggest reducing the number of rear-area troops and assigning soldiers to actual work as much as possible. Regarding increasing revenue, a one-time property tax will be levied. In addition, the government may introduce a kind of "disguised subsidy policy" in exchange for foreign exchange.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The five groups under the National Economic Commission held meetings this week to thoroughly review the issue of balancing the budget. They have now completed the review and are preparing a report to be submitted to the National Economic Commission on the 9th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The authorities are carefully studying the issue of levying a one-time property tax, and its implementation is only a matter of time. It is reported that at the meeting of the National Economic Commission, some committee members argued that the national economy is on the brink of such a critical juncture, and the wealthy families cannot be allowed to continue to be unfettered. In order to give the people of the country a fresh start, at least a "symbolic levy" should be made. Some people suggested simply listing the names of 100 wealthy families and levying a 50% one-time property tax as an example for the world.

### Gold Returns to Shanghai from the US and Discusses the Current Situation in China; The CCP's Delaying Tactics Aim to Further Deteriorate the Economy

[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Gold, the chief editor of the Shanghai-based "China Press," returned to Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday and gave detailed answers to various questions raised by reporters. Mr. Gold believes that although Marshall's mediation has failed, the essence of the United States' policy towards China has not changed. However, this setback has made Americans realize the difficulty of dealing with the China issue. Therefore, in terms of attitude, it used to be biased towards emotion, but now it focuses on reality. The goal, however, remains unchanged and will be pursued with even greater effort. US loans to China are commercial loans, not political loans. When making loans, it is necessary to consider whether they can be repaid. Therefore, in the special telegram he sent, he believed that only if China achieves internal peace can the loans be successfully implemented. However, this is a general inference and does not specifically refer to any particular loan. In terms of the situation in China, the Communist Party is currently implementing a delaying tactic, hoping that the domestic economic situation will further deteriorate, thereby strengthening the CCP's position. However, the result of this policy is that the entire country of China suffers. When the reporter told him that some people believe that if US-Soviet relations improve, the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be easier to resolve, Mr. Gold replied, "Everyone has their own views. Personally, I believe that the United States has no intention of supporting the Kuomintang in order to gain control in China, and the Soviet Union will not openly support the CCP." Regarding the Truman Doctrine, Mr. Gold believes that this is the recognition and proposition of the American people in general. It is inappropriate to associate this policy with President Truman's name, because an individual's political fate is uncertain. In both world wars, the United States was drawn into the vortex against its own wishes. Therefore, it is generally believed that the United States should be more involved in world affairs and provide more assistance to those in need. Today, the world is becoming smaller and smaller, so the international thinking of the American people is also rising. As for whether this policy will stimulate the Soviet Union, it depends on the Soviet Union's thinking. If it does not engage in Third International activities and promote communism in the world, there is no reason to be dissatisfied with the United States' policy. The reporter told him that the people and the government of our country attach great importance to the reconstruction of Japan, believing that it will one day threaten China and the world. Mr. Gold believes that there is no need to overemphasize this, because Japan's current predicament is beyond people's imagination and cannot be restored in the short term. The United States will also strictly implement its control over Japan for a long time. However, the Japanese people are working hard to improve their environment in light of the current situation. He believes that Japan's reconstruction is enough to warn China, but it will not pose a threat in a considerable period of time.

### Manchester Guardian Comments on the CCP's Misdeeds

[Central News Agency, London, 6th] The Manchester Guardian published an article by its correspondent in China, stating that we should not ignore the misdeeds of the Communist Party system because of our dissatisfaction with the Kuomintang. Regarding the CCP's misdeeds, the correspondent stated: There are many reports about the CCP's atrocities in the Communist-controlled areas, and the sources are different, so there must be some truth in them. Every time the Communist Party coerces any area, the people of that area flee to the government-controlled area, and no one has ever heard of people from the government-controlled area going to the Communist-controlled area. The article also discussed the possibility of British trade with China, saying that the opportunity for British trade with China is very small at present. However, a well-known Shanghai businessman once said that British companies in China must maintain their confidence, and the opportunity will change, and the opportunity for British businessmen will still come. The article concluded by saying that China currently has a genuine friendship with Britain, believing that Britain has no ambitions towards China, and Britain's declaration of independence for India has made a deep impression on China and has made Britain no longer regarded as an imperialist country.

### Chiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party Writes to Secretary-General Wu

Inquiring About the Arrest of Members of the Social Democratic Party

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Chiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party wrote to Wu Tiecheng and Lei Zhen on the 7th, inquiring about the arrest of Li Yunzhang of the party in Xuanhua on the 7th.

### The Periphery of Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang is Peaceful; The Main Force of the Communist Army in Shandong Retreats to the Second Line; Tense Warfare in Northern Henan is Imminent

[Our Jinan Office, 7th] The periphery of Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang has been peaceful for the past week. In Jinan, only the independent regiment of the Communist Army is stationed in Xijiao [?], the first military sub-district with a thousand people is stationed in Wenzu [?], and the central Shandong military district with two thousand people is stationed at Tusikou and Chayekou. On the north bank of the Yellow River, on the Taozhang side, more than 10,000 remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops who had fled back from northern Henan arrived the other day and are resting and reorganizing. On the Yimeng Mountain area, the Yiju front line, there have only been small battles in the past week.

[Our Jinan Office, 7th] It is reported that the main force of the Shandong Communist Army has temporarily withdrawn from the Yu [?] front and is actively reorganizing and preparing to move again on the second line. As for when and where the next major war will break out, there are no obvious signs to be found at present. The current distribution of the ten columns of the Shandong Communist Army is: the First Column is stationed in Donglidian, the Seventh Column is stationed in Dazhangzhuang (both between Boshan and Yishui), the Second and Sixth Columns are stationed in Boshan, the Third and Fourth Columns are stationed in Linshui, Yidu and Mazhan, Jiangyu, the Fifth Column is stationed north of Zhucheng to the Jiaoji Railway, the current Eighth Column is stationed in Jitai, the Tenth Column is stationed in Zhangqiu, Qidong, and the Ninth Column is stationed in Dazeshan, southeast of Laiyang. The main reason for the Shandong Communist Party to adopt this deployment is that all the wells in the area near the Yimeng Mountain battlefield were blocked with hot rocks during the major battle in the middle of last month. In addition, due to the lack of food, in order to facilitate the supply and receive new recruits, they have grabbed the newly commissioned village as military rations. Therefore, there is this new arrangement. It is absolutely not true that a part of the main force of the Communist Army has crossed the river, attempting to attack Beiping and Tianjin. In fact, as of the 7th, only a small number of troops crossed the river to Huimin and Lijin to receive new recruits. Currently, the Jiang Communist Education Brigade Special 12th Regiment is stationed in Huimin, and a new recruit division is stationed in Lijin.

[Our Jinan Office, 7th] After the sporadic Communist troops lurking in the triangular area of Changqing, Feicheng, and Pingyin were actively mopped up by the Nationalist army in the past week, they were all wiped out by the 6th. The remnants of the Cui Ziming and Zhang Yaonan troops of the Jilu-Yu military region of the Communist army, with 2,000 each, have fled to the area between Feicheng and Dongping. The Nationalist army is continuing to pursue them.

[Our Xinpu Office, 7th] Xiangshuikou, a major town in Guanyun County, was captured by the Communist army at 1 am last night. Many people in the city were massacred by the Communist army. The Nationalist army in Haizhou rushed to reinforce and counterattack, and the fighting was quite fierce.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th] The Nationalist army advancing northward in northern Henan and Liu Bocheng's main force of the Communist army have both been maneuvering in a vast area recently, and war is imminent. At the moment, a part of Liu Bocheng's main force has indeed crossed the Wei River, but a part is still in the Wulingji and Tunziji areas southeast of Tangyin. Qi County has now become a military vacuum area, because it is not very important in the current strategic situation of both sides. The Nationalist army in Anyang has completely recovered the villages within 15 li to the southeast and 20 li to the north and south. The Communist army is everywhere exposing vulnerabilities, and the situation in Anyang has in fact disappeared.

### Regarding the Political Consultative Conference's Call for Peace, the CCP Responds Informally, Denying the Conference's Qualifications and Rejecting Peace Talks

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Although the plan to reopen peace talks with the CCP has been proposed by the Political Consultative Conference, its realization is extremely difficult. According to a broadcast by the CCP's Xinhua News Agency radio station on the evening of the 5th, they have made an informal response to the peace call made by the Political Consultative Conference. The CCP has denied the qualifications of the Political Consultative Conference, claiming that the Political Consultative Conference is a Political Consultative Conference used by the Kuomintang. The conference has proposed stopping grain collection and conscription, and issued a call for peace. At the same time, it has made various resolutions that are conducive to war, which is a loss of the true meaning of peace. When the reporter asked government officials about this issue on the 7th, it was said that the CCP's statement was another rejection of peace talks and the closing of the door to peace. There are many reefs in the future of peace, and the government's unilateral proposal of peace cannot achieve results.

### US Tea Expert Hutchinson Discusses China's Tea Improvement Plan, Emphasizing More Advertising to Compete with Indian Tea

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] US tea expert Hutchinson met with a Central News Agency reporter alone to comment on the Chinese government's three-year plan to improve the tea industry. He said that the plan is good, but its implementation may be difficult. Since the end of the war, the quality of Chinese tea has been poor, and the Indian and Ceylon tea industries have done a lot of advertising, while China has done nothing in this regard. As a result, the average American knows Indian and Ceylon tea better than Chinese tea. According to Hutchinson, the number of buyers of Chinese tea has decreased sharply due to its poor quality. When the reporter asked whether the three-year plan is enough to make Chinese tea regain the American market, Hutchinson believed that more advertising may increase sales in the United States, but since most Americans prefer Indian and Ceylon tea, Chinese tea can at most follow suit and cannot become a major [?] American country. Hutchinson admitted that according to the plan, China [?] is easy to develop into a good tea exporting country. At the same time, Hutchinson [?] showed: due to poor quality, the number of [?] tea that was returned is countless [?]. From January to May this year, the number of [?] pounds of Chinese tea exported to the United States was 100,670 [?], of which 45,000 pounds were returned. Of the 119,157 pounds of Wucha, 53,990 pounds were returned. Of the 80,480 pounds of Guangzhou Bird with Lotus [?], there were also 1,690 [?] pounds [?] pounds were returned. On the other hand, 1,215 pounds of Longjing tea, 12,418 pounds of Xiang [?] tea, 53,430 pounds of Qimen tea, 928 pounds of Litchi School tea (translated from the past), and 27,016 pounds of Luoshan tea (translated), all were purchased without any returns. Hutchinson said that Chinese tea exporters have many difficulties in packaging. He believes that the reason is that China lacks wood. Experiments have been done here, and wooden boxes have been quite successful. He hopes that exporters will use wooden boxes, because the cost is lower, the weight is lighter, and it is easier to transport.

American Tea Merchants to Meet This Fall to Discuss High Price Problems

[Another Cable] Bain, chairman of the American Tea Association, told a Central News Agency reporter that the future of Chinese tea is still not bright, because the current tea market is very chaotic, and Chinese tea has been declining for the past twenty years. The quality of Chinese [?] tea exported after the war is also poor. Bain pointed out that the United States consumes 60 million pounds of tea every year, of which 80% [?] is produced in India and [?] Sri Lanka. The tea produced in China and Taiwan accounts for only 20% of the tea consumed in the United States every year. Another noteworthy fact is that the sales of Chinese tea in other parts of the world (excluding North Africa and the Soviet Union) are also not good. Therefore, he does not know how the Chinese government can expect to export such a quantity of tea this year, because there is no large-scale market for Chinese tea to sell immediately. When the reporter asked why large chain grocery stores in the United States only sell Indian and Ceylon tea and no Chinese tea, Bain replied that this is because Indian and Ceylon tea is cultivated in a scientific way for a long time, so the quality is excellent. He also said that American tea merchants will hold a national conference this fall to discuss the high price problems encountered by American tea after the war. The conference will put forward many suggestions [?] and will definitely involve the future policy of American tea and the three-year plan for the revival of the Chinese tea industry. The American Tea Association has a total of 110 members, including packaging companies, distributors, importers, and guarantors [?], and the largest chain [?] grocery stores.

### The Food Panic Has Passed; Foreign Rice is Being Shipped to China, and Sichuan Province Has Also Had a Bumper Harvest; Food Administration Authorities Say Rice Prices Have Generally Fallen

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Food administration authorities told reporters on the 7th in a [?] optimistic tone that the food panic is almost over. Rice prices have generally fallen in various places, and will continue to fall in the short term. It is said that the following points at least can be optimistic: (1) A large number of foreign rice is coming to China. In addition to the 300,000 [?] tons of foreign rice purchased with US relief funds, the 200,000 tons allocated to China by the International Food Conference are also being rushed to China by the China Trust Bureau. From this month onwards, at least 70,000 to 80,000 tons can be shipped every month. In addition, the China Trust Bureau has purchased and shipped 200,000 tons of wheat and flour. (2) Sichuan Province has had a bumper harvest this year, and the number of rice boats leaving Sichuan is increasing every day. Recently, a boat carrying more than 100 tons has arrived, and a large amount will continue to arrive in the future. (3) Anhui and other provinces have lifted the ban, and a large amount of Anhui rice can be shipped to Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. (4) New wheat has been harvested. All of these will be of great help in regulating food for the people.

### Reviewing the Economy of Chahar and Suiyuan

Zhang Zhentang's Pacification Headquarters Holds a Peak Meeting

### Luo Zhuoying and Wang Dongyuan Given Reprimands

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] In the resolution announced by the Political Affairs Disciplinary Committee on the 7th, Wang Dongyuan, the former chairman of Hubei Province, were given reprimands. According to the resolution, Luo was impeached by Zhang Kefu, Li Zhengle and other supervisory committee members because provincial civil servants in Guangdong Province had gathered to destroy the Guangdong Audit Office of the Auditing Department. Wang was impeached by Miao Peicheng, the supervisory commissioner, for illegally spending interest on deposit money during his tenure as chairman of Hubei Province.

### The Ministry of Communications is Working to Increase Freight Transportation on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] A senior official of the Railways told a United Press reporter that the Ministry of Communications is eager to increase freight transportation on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. The measures are: converting the entire line into a double-track line, converting some sections into variable tracks, establishing a central transportation control system, and improving the automatic signal system.

However, the cost of converting to a double-track line is too high, so the last two measures are most likely to be adopted. Insufficient funds are the most important difficulty, and if the Five [?] Tianjin loan is successful, it is hoped that a part of it can be allocated to the Ministry of Communications.

He also said that the negotiations on the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing railway with French investment have not made any progress so far.

### Authorities Consider Merging Two Disciplinary Committees

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The two organizations, the Political Officials Disciplinary Committee and the Central Civil Servants Disciplinary Committee, were originally separated, which caused many constraints on the handling of cases.

### A Japanese Doctor in the Communist Area Defects to the Nationalist Army

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Gao [?] Minlang, a Japanese national in the Health Department of the Jicha Military Region of the Chinese Communist Party, defected to the Nationalist Army on the front line of Guangling on the 21st of last month and has now arrived in Zhangjiakou. He is from Osaka, 28 years old, and a doctor. After Japan surrendered, he was forced to serve the Chinese Communist Party.

### Communist Army in Eastern Gansu Surrenders

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 7th] Li Zhanshan, the leader of the Communist guerrillas in eastern Gansu, led his unit of 17 people to surrender to the Nationalist Army with rifles on the 5th, on the grounds that the Communist Party was betraying the country and harming the people.

### Remnant Communist Troops in the Changcheng Coal Mine Area Eliminated

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] A spokesman for the Beiping Pacification Headquarters answered reporters' questions on the 7th, saying: (1) The area on both sides of the Guan Nei section of the Beiping-Ningxia line is being mopped up. The remnant Communist troops in the Changcheng Coal Mine and Beidaihe area have now been eliminated. As for Qian'an and Funing in Hebei, they can be recovered immediately when they need to be recovered strategically. However, at present, the Nationalist army does not regard the two cities [?] as the goal of the battle. (2) Regarding the censorship of news, it is because of the need for public security. The headquarters has submitted a request to the headquarters for the implementation of martial law. This is based on the provisions of the Martial Law Act for censorship of news. After martial law is lifted at an appropriate time, the censorship of news will inevitably stop along with it.

[Our Newspaper's Qingdao Dispatch on the 7th] Major theft cases have occurred in Qingdao's US military warehouses for several consecutive days. On the evening of the 4th, Warehouse No. 1 in Dagang was robbed of ninety large cases of "Six Happiness" brand cigarettes, worth over three hundred million yuan. Yesterday morning, Warehouse No. 14 was robbed of ninety-one large cases of hard candies.

Upon interrogation, it was revealed that Liu Guoxin, a technician from the Commodity Inspection Bureau, had stored them there, and Liu was immediately arrested. He confessed that the cigarettes were sold by the US military and jointly purchased by Guo Weixin and Lin Jinzuo.

Based on clues, the US military has detained and interrogated several suspected American soldiers, and the truth will soon be revealed.

### Japan's Territorial Ambitions Revive, British and Philippine Public Opinion Resentful, Hong Kong Chinese Newspapers Criticize Severely

[Reuters London Dispatch on the 6th] The revival of Japan's territorial ambitions has aroused resentment in British public opinion. Recent newspaper reports that Japanese Foreign Ministry officials admitted to having ambitions to "recover" Taiwan are particularly unrealistic, as the Cairo Declaration specifically stipulated that the island should be returned to China. Meanwhile, a British Foreign Office spokesman stated tonight that Britain considers the transfer of the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union a fait accompli and does not need to wait for the ratification of the Far East Peace Treaty. Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida recently stated at a press conference in Tokyo that Japan would demand the return of at least some of the Kuril Islands and revise the land provisions for Japan announced by the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference in 1945. Foreign observers say that although Britain will regard the provisions of the Yalta Secret Agreement regarding the transfer of the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union as a definite decision, Japan may argue that the land declarations issued by the Allied leaders during the war were not clear in meaning. The Potsdam Declaration stated that the conditions of the Cairo Declaration of 1943 would be implemented, and that Japan's sovereignty after the war would only extend to the four main islands of the mainland and some small islands to be determined by the Allies. If this provision is combined with the Yalta Secret Agreement, then the Kuril Islands cannot continue to be retained by Japan. However, the Japanese may argue that the Cairo Declaration limits the content of the Potsdam Agreement; the Cairo Declaration stipulates that Japan must return the land it had seized since 1914, any land seized from China, and any land seized by force, and the Kuril Islands do not fall into any of the aforementioned categories, as Japan obtained the Kuril Islands from Russia in exchange for the southern part of Sakhalin Island under the Treaty of St. Petersburg in 1875. Although Japan recovered the southern part of Sakhalin Island after the Russo-Japanese War, it continued to occupy the Kuril Islands. Britain's response to this Japanese argument would be that the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement should prevail in the event of a conflict with the provisions of the Cairo Agreement, and the Yalta Agreement has absolute binding force.

[Associated Press Manila Dispatch on the 7th] There is considerable dissatisfaction here with the statement of Japan's new Foreign Minister Ashida. Ashida stated that Japan hopes to retain the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, when concluding a peace treaty with the Allies. An editorial in today's Manila Bulletin stated that Ashida's focus on "additional territory" seems "better than restoring trade." Ashida hopes to recover the Ryukyu Islands and the Kuril Islands, and establish a police force equipped with Lee-Enfield rifles and machine guns. Ashida mentioned with great care that Japan would not demand the restoration of its army and navy, but in fact, it contained the implication that "such a request may be made in the future."

[Central News Agency Hong Kong Dispatch on the 7th] Japan's desire to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States, as well as its desire to enjoy special immigration rights to Taiwan, has today aroused severe criticism from Chinese newspapers here. An editorial in the Huaqiao Daily stated that the Ryukyu Islands have belonged to China since ancient times, and the Cairo and Potsdam Agreements stipulated that Taiwan and other lost territories should be returned to China after the war. The newspaper stated that the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan are permanently maintained as part of Chinese territory, which is not only important for protecting China's long coastline but also for maintaining peace in the Far East. The Guomin Daily, in exposing Japan's dual personality, stated that aggression against Chinese territory must be stopped by all means. The newspaper also warned that the strategic value of the Ryukyu Islands in the hands of Japan may lead to further aggression against China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The newspaper also reminded the world that Japan used Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands as a base for southward expansion in the past, leading to World War II.

### Taiwan Senators and National Assembly Representatives Resolve to Telegraph Chairman Jiang to Properly Plan Countermeasures to Defeat Japanese Conspiracy, Taiwanese Compatriots Unanimously Indignant Towards Japan

[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch on the 7th] Taiwan Provincial Senators and National Assembly representatives held a joint meeting this morning to discuss the issue of Japan's attempt to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands and obtain special immigration rights to Taiwan. They resolved to telegraph Chairman Chiang to properly plan countermeasures to defeat the Japanese conspiracy. Furthermore, the Taiwan Provincial Senate is scheduled to convene its first session of the third congress on the 20th. The Taipei City Council closed this afternoon, passing a resolution endorsing Chairman Wei's social stability policy and resolving to organize an inland inspection tour, with city councilors signing up to participate. The number of members and the travel schedule have not yet been determined.

[Central News Agency Taipei Dispatch on the 7th] The Taiwanese compatriots who have been ravaged by Japanese imperialism for more than half a century are deeply indignant at today's defeated Japan, which openly expresses unreasonable demands to the victorious nations, attempting to obtain its immigration privileges to Taiwan. At the moment, this bizarre and absurd news has become a common topic of conversation among Taiwanese compatriots. Some people believe that the most effective measure to head off Japan's attempt to meddle in Taiwan again is to immediately send all seven hundred and thirteen Japanese expatriates currently remaining in Taiwan back to Japan. This argument is not new. Last year, the most vocal proponents of large-scale repatriation of Japanese expatriates were the Taiwanese compatriots who were oppressed by the Japanese, not the officials of the former Taiwan Provincial Government. After the retrocession of Taiwan, according to statistics from the Governor-General's Office of Taiwan under Japanese rule, there were a total of 323,259 Japanese expatriates in Taiwan. Before January 35, the Taiwan Provincial Government's review resulted in a confirmed number of 322,149 Japanese expatriates, and another 183,079 Japanese troops stationed in Taiwan. After our country's three repatriations, except for the Japanese troops who were all repatriated first, there are currently 713 Japanese expatriates remaining in Taiwan, including 260 technical personnel retained for employment and 453 family members.

### Taiwan Compatriots in Shanghai Send Telegram Demanding Stern Protest

[Report from our Newspaper] Representatives of the Taiwan Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, representing Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai, requested the government authorities to take effective measures to prevent the ambitions of Japanese imperialism. They sent a special telegram to the Chairman of the National Government and the President of the Executive Yuan, as well as the Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government, stating: "Japan hopes to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States, obtain fishing rights near the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island, and obtain immigration rights in Taiwan." This record is likely not groundless. If it is indeed a fact, then our six million Taiwanese compatriots will once again fall into slavery, and national sovereignty will be infringed upon. The shame may be even worse than the cession of Taiwan in 1895. For the present plan, we earnestly hope that our government will quickly investigate the truth. If there is such a thing, a serious protest should be lodged immediately, and a peace conference should be convened to firmly maintain the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, listing its territorial authority as an important agenda item, so as to prevent its immigration pretext, and ensure that the aggressor does not repeat its cunning tricks. This will not only preserve the enthusiasm of all Taiwanese people who have endured humiliation and sought glory for the motherland for fifty years but will also be the unanimous sympathy of the entire Republic of China. The members of this association witnessed the increasingly dangerous situation with great concern and sent an urgent telegram to your government to take effective measures to maintain international prestige and comfort the people's hope. Taiwan Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, Chairman Li Weiguang, and all members."

### Tainan Pulp Mill Starts Production

### Neutral Countries' Factories in Japan Completely Used as Reparations, MacArthur Receives Instructions

[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch on the 7th] Authoritative sources said today: The US Joint Chiefs of Staff instructed MacArthur for the Far East Commission that not only Japanese and enemy industrial in Japan were used as reparations, but factories of neutral countries in the country were used as reparations. Since the announcement of reparations, this is the first time MacArthur has received clear orders from the Far East Commission on the issue of reparations. The order of the Joint Chiefs of Staff lists Japanese military industries and supporting military industries as the first industries to be dismantled, and "financial" industries are also listed in the priority reparations list. After the above-mentioned industries are removed, the Allied Headquarters is authorized to use the industries established by the enemy in Japan as reparations. The order also instructs MacArthur to choose the most complete factories for reparations, so as to avoid requesting countries to obtain dilapidated or even unusable factories. An authoritative person said that the new order of the Far East Commission will not greatly interfere with MacArthur's efforts to resolve the reparations issue since Japan's surrender. They pointed out that MacArthur's compensation plan has so far been generally operated in accordance with the new instructions of the Far East Commission.

Editorial

### Social Security Movement

Yesterday, various circles in Shanghai organized the "Social Security Promotion Association" and held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, proclaiming the slogan "Uphold justice, support good people." This slogan is resonant, and this movement is active. We must pay attention to this major social event.

Social security is a common demand of people in various countries during and after the war, and it is also a policy that every progressive government strives to achieve. In China, especially in Shanghai, the center of economy and culture, social security is a call that every citizen wants to make. However, how this urgent call can be translated into reality is still worthy of our deep discussion. Many elders and virtuous people have already made this grand wish, and we sincerely hope that they can persevere so that this great and meaningful social security movement can unfold vigorously.

To achieve social security, we must first understand the reasons why society today feels insecure. The war continues, peace talks are hopeless, discipline is swept away, and credibility is lost: these are political factors of insecurity. Prices are high, people's livelihood is difficult, rural areas are bankrupt, and industry is in danger: these are economic factors of insecurity. Public morale is declining, morality is abandoned, the virtuous are hidden, and violence is rampant: these are social factors of insecurity. Loss of self-confidence, dependence, misunderstanding of freedom, and misinterpretation of democracy: these are cultural factors of insecurity. Psychological abnormality, social deformity, suspicion as a norm, and struggle as a task: these are psychological factors of insecurity. These various factors accumulate, interact, and intertwine to form the complex and comprehensive result of social insecurity. If we truly want to promote social security, and further ensure social security, we must pool our wisdom and efforts, act promptly, and simultaneously address all aspects to thoroughly eradicate these many root causes of the disease.

Today, to save society and save the country, no matter how many words are spoken, we must first ask everyone to bring forth their conscience! This is what Mencius called the extension of innate knowledge, and also what Mr. Yangming called the unity of knowledge and action. And today's greatest problem for the country lies in the fact that self-respecting people (that is, so-called good people) mostly only know how to passively protect themselves and are unwilling to stand up, unite, and take on the important task of supporting the tottering and rescuing the endangered. This may be due to the fact that the authorities have not sincerely sought talent, only knowing to look within a few parties, not knowing to sincerely search in the wider society, and mostly because the government has no rewards or punishments, and society has no right or wrong, so righteousness declines and the overall situation deteriorates. In fact, there is no time without talent, and no place without the virtuous. As the saying goes, "Within a hundred steps, there must be fragrant grass, and within a town of ten households, there must be loyalty and trustworthiness." We only need to encourage people with courage and righteousness in every place to join hands and unite to reverse the declining trend, and society can be stabilized, and politics will gradually become clear. This is the same principle as what Mr. Disheng said: "The origin of customs is thin, depending on the direction of one or two people's hearts." Today, we can say that we have reached the crossroads of social decline and social stability, the boundary between national peril and national revival. The degree of severity and danger does not allow us to take it lightly! If social leaders stubbornly cling to their old ways, or only know how to be depressed and sigh, or even become angry and reckless, and do not take a proactive attitude to solve the people's suffering and purify the political atmosphere from political, economic, social, cultural, and psychological aspects, then the country's future may be unimaginable. This is why we attach importance to the social security movement launched in Shanghai yesterday.

Finally, I would like to offer a word to the government authorities: The shocking waves of June 2nd have indeed passed, but the authorities must not think that they can rest easy, especially not mistakenly believe that when a crisis comes, a declaration of martial law can be handled easily and adequately. It must be understood that the formation of a flood must have its inherent causes; if after the torrent has passed, one does not know how to dredge and cure the root cause, and encounters a dangerous situation again in the blink of an eye, it will inevitably be more turbulent than before, and if the effectiveness of the dyke is lost, the situation will inevitably collapse and overflow without stopping! Therefore, the overall situation today is by no means a time for the authorities to congratulate themselves and announce stability, but rather a time for officials and people to cooperate, concentrate their efforts, open their hearts, spread justice, clarify right and wrong, and distinguish between good and evil, in order to soothe the people's grievances and cure the cancer of inequality between the rich and the poor. Then, not only can social security be guaranteed, but the entire country can also easily reverse the chaos and return to the right path, and truly see prosperity. We sincerely hope that the social security movement in Shanghai can influence the whole country, so that the government can understand the true trend of popular will and decide on a policy of how to start anew with the people!

### Soviet Interference in Hungarian Internal Affairs, US to Lodge Strong Protest, Accuses Soviets of Violating Agreements and Investigation is Necessary

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] It was officially announced here today that the State Department has drafted a strongly worded protest to be lodged with the Soviet commander in Hungary, stating that Soviet actions in Hungary constitute illegal interference in Hungarian internal affairs and suggesting that the three powers investigate the situation in Hungary. It further implied that if a satisfactory response is not received, the United States will take action. The note has not yet been presented to the Hungarian government, and it is hoped that more information can be obtained from Hungary before it is sent. President Truman is understood to have fully agreed to the contents of the draft note. It is understood that the note will state that the US State Department believes that the Soviet commander in Hungary is directly related to the events that led to the resignation of former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, and therefore constitutes a direct act of interference in Hungarian internal affairs. The note will also accuse Soviet officials of violating the Yalta Agreement, in which the three powers jointly stated that they would coordinate the policies of the three powers' governments during the temporary period after the liberation of Europe before it became stable, to assist the European people in solving their urgent political and economic problems by democratic means. The State Department's note will also suggest the establishment of a three-power fact-finding mission to investigate the entire political situation in Hungary. The note concludes by stating that if a satisfactory response is not received on all the requested points, the United States will consider filing a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly or Security Council. It is also reported that Brigadier General Weems, the US representative on the Allied Control Commission in Hungary, asked the Soviet commander earlier this week to provide information on the resignation of Nagy. It is not yet known whether the Soviet commander has replied. It is expected that the State Department will wait for the Soviet commander to respond to the previous request before submitting its protest note.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 7th] It has been learned that the British Foreign Office has received a copy of the protest note that the United States intends to present to the Allied Control Commission in Hungary. Well-informed sources believe that the United Kingdom will likely support the US proposal to establish a British, American, and Soviet commission to investigate the situation in Hungary.

[United Press International, Washington, 6th] Officials announced today that after the United States ratifies the peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, the United Nations occupying forces should withdraw within ninety days. If the withdrawal of Soviet troops in Hungary is delayed at that time, the responsibility should be borne solely by the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] Authoritative sources told the Associated Press on the 6th that the United States does not intend to sever diplomatic relations with the new Hungarian regime. US Minister to Hungary Chapin will depart for the Hungarian capital within the month to take up his diplomatic duties.

### Rumor that Hungarian Army is Under Soviet Command, Hungarian Secret Police Arresting People in Austria

[Agence France-Presse, Hungarian Capital, 6th] Hungarian Radio broadcast tonight an official gazette issued by the Supreme National Committee, stating that the political turmoil caused by former Prime Minister Nagy's participation in a conspiracy has now been resolved within forty-eight hours, and the domestic situation is calm.

[Reuters, Vienna, 6th] It is reported that former Hungarian Speaker of Parliament Varga, who is accused of participating in a coup conspiracy, is now hiding in Vienna. Thirty Hungarian secret police have arrived in Vienna, and the Hungarian embassy here has requested Austrian police to protect him. It is reported that Kadori, a Hungarian Peasant Party member of parliament, disappeared in Vienna two days ago and is believed to have been abducted back to Hungary. Another Peasant Party member of parliament who fled with Varga is now living in a refugee camp in the British sector of Vienna. It is also reported that the Hungarian army has been directly controlled by Soviet officers since four days ago, and military discipline has been tightened. Another report states that Kovacs, Secretary-General of the Hungarian Peasant Party, who was arrested by Soviet troops in February, has died in prison.

### Soviets Plan to Strike at the Truman Doctrine, Preparing to Form Balkan Federation, Romania Decides to Go to the Capital of Yugoslavia

[United Press International, Bulgarian Capital, 6th] Petkov, leader of the Peasant Party, the only opposition party in the Bulgarian Communist government, was arrested today and tried for plotting to resist the current government. At the same time, frequent news from the Balkan Peninsula indicates that the Soviet Union is planning to strike at the Truman Doctrine and rapidly consolidate its sphere of influence in Europe. Romanian Communist Prime Minister Groza and his cabinet members have departed for the capital of Yugoslavia to hold meetings. It is widely believed that a Balkan Federation ruled by the Soviet Union is being prepared there.

[United Press International, Bulgarian Capital, 6th] Petkov, leader of the opposition party of the Bulgarian Communist government, told reporters when he was arrested and imprisoned today that he had long expected this arrest, "but it is only an extension of past events in Hungary." His crime is closely related to two cases of plotting to resist the government.

### Disarmament Discussions Unsuccessful, Soviet Union Alone Holds Dissenting Views, Forming Stalemate

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 6th] After five meetings, the subcommittee of the United Nations Armaments Commission, composed of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, still failed to reach a choice between the work plans proposed by the United States and the Soviet Union, and had to admit that no agreement could be reached, and the problem was returned to the Disarmament Commission for discussion.

The subcommittee adjourned in a complete stalemate. The Disarmament Commission is now scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on Wednesday to discuss the disarmament issue anew.

### Gromyko Clarifies Position on International Police Force, Differing from Opinions of China, Britain, the United States, and France

[Reuters, Lake Success, 6th] Soviet representative Gromyko told the Security Council today that opinions differed greatly on the report of the Military Staff Committee on the organization of the international police force. The Soviet Union still firmly insists on the following points: (1) The number and organization of troops from the five powers participating in the international police force must be equal; (2) The amount of the international police force should be small in principle; (3) Member states of the United Nations shall not be ordered to supply bases for the international police force; (4) The troops of the United Nations member states participating in the international police force can only be stationed within their own territory; (5) After completing its mission, the international police force should withdraw from the place of mission within thirty days; (6) The United Nations member states supplying the international police force should provide the equipment and supplies needed by their national troops. Regarding the number of international police vehicles, he believes that after the defeat of Germany and Japan, there is no need to maintain a large international police force, and the General Assembly of the United Nations has already made a resolution on disarmament, so the Security Council only needs to retain a relatively small international police force at present. Gromyko further said: The requirement of bases conflicts with one of the main tasks of the United Nations organization, namely, to develop and strengthen international good-neighborly relations. If the supply of bases is stipulated when establishing the international police force, it will cause international friction and hinder the establishment of friendly relations. Finally, he strongly stated that the international police force supplied by the United Nations member states can only be stationed in their own territory or territorial waters. The points mentioned by Gromyko above are all contrary to the opinions of China, Britain, the United States, and France.

### Third Anniversary of Allied Landing in France, Truman Delivers Speech, Saying the US Must Maintain Strength to Cope with Events

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 7th, broadcast: President Truman, speaking to veterans in Kansas City on the third anniversary of the Allied landing in France, said, "If we want to support the United Nations, we must uphold the principles under which world peace is inscribed, that any nation in the world should have the right to live freely under a democratically elected institution without the threat of aggression. The way we lead the nations of the world to strive for peace is to assist nations to improve or build free and independent countries. Only by maintaining our strength can we fulfill our obligation to maintain peace. Having the intention of peace without the strength of peace is useless."

He continued: "Since the surrender of Germany and Japan, our troops have been disbanded, which is tantamount to encouraging some countries to take advantage of the weaknesses of peace-loving countries and harbor ambitions of aggression. This has made the countries that share our ideas and keep pace with us, but lack materials or manpower, gradually lose confidence in our maintenance of doctrine. Hitler's dream of ruling the world was actually caused by his deep belief that other countries lacked the will to resist. The calculation of the strength of democratic countries by the Nazis is gradually weakening, and their hearts are eager to prepare for war. In 1939, Hitler saw through the enemy's lack of preparation and strengthened his determination to march into Poland. Japan believed that the United States' strength could not counterattack, so it dared to attack Pearl Harbor. Therefore, we must maintain the strength of the army, navy, and air force to cope with emergencies. The organization of the army, navy, and air force should be a separate and strong military organization, and there must be a well-trained reserve army. Not only that, we must also have a sound and prosperous economic system, developed agriculture, fully developed natural resources, and a nation with a sense of responsibility and self-confidence."

### Eisenhower Encourages Soldiers to Maintain Firm Confidence

Without American leadership, there will immediately be great social, political, and economic chaos among billions of people. Eisenhower also mentioned that three years ago today was the day the Allied forces landed in Normandy. The 35th Division was one of the troops led by Eisenhower in Europe during World War II.

### Eight Public Utilities - Price Increases to Take Effect Tomorrow - Estimated Losses of 2.4 Billion This Month - Further Adjustments Possible Next Month

[Report from this newspaper] The adjustment of public utility prices in this city has been approved by the National Price Conference. In terms of electricity prices, Shanghai Electric Power Company will increase from 325 yuan to 570 yuan per kilowatt-hour, an increase of 245 yuan. Other electric companies will increase by 319 yuan. Telephone prices will double for calls under 400, and increase by 75% for calls over 400. Other utilities such as tap water, gas, streetcars, buses, ferries, and small railways will all increase by an average of double, starting tomorrow (the 9th). However, Shanghai Electric Power Company, not receiving subsidies, has been specially permitted to implement the additional increase from May 21st in advance. Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau specially hosted the press yesterday to report on this matter, stating briefly that the National Price Conference believed that public utility agencies were incurring excessive losses. If the central government were to fully subsidize them, the national treasury would bear too heavy a burden. It was decided to allow each company to make appropriate increases in advance, in addition to maintaining the original subsidy amount. It is estimated that after the price increases, each company will still incur losses of 24 billion yuan in June. However, this is a transition from subsidized to normally adjusted prices, and the momentum should not be too sudden. The amount that all companies lack will require further remedial measures.

As for the future policy of the authorities regarding public utility prices, according to Director Zhao's announcement yesterday: price adjustments will be made in a gradual manner, so further adjustments may be made next month. It is said that "According to our ideals, it would be best in the future to adopt an automatic adjustment method based on the cost of living index, material prices, and exchange rates. Because public utilities absolutely must be maintained, and must be gradually developed, they cannot be allowed to decline."

For the convenience of citizens participating in politics, this reporter has specially listed the original prices and the newly adjusted prices of public utilities in this city below:

### Social Security Promotion Association - Inaugural Meeting Held Yesterday - Mayor Explains Reasons for Arresting Students

The Shanghai Social Security Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 3:00 PM. Over 300 people attended, including heads of various agencies, leaders of various industries, and representatives of various people's organizations. Chairman Wang Zhengting first reported on the significance of establishing the association, stating briefly that after the victory, social order had not yet been stabilized for various reasons. Considering that the stability of a place affects the entire country, they initiated this association to gather collective wisdom and strength, unite all citizens who love society and the country, contribute money and effort, and especially bring out a sense of justice to constantly seek the stability of Shanghai society.

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech stating: The prerequisite for Shanghai's prosperity should be stability, but stabilizing society is not enough with the power of the government alone, and requires the assistance of all citizens.

The mayor then reviewed the handling of the student unrest, saying that the safe passage of "June 2nd" should be thanked to the painstaking efforts of the security authorities. He finally explained the reasons for arresting the students, saying: Before May 25th, the following reliable information was obtained: (1) The CCP ordered students who launched the strike to resume classes quickly in order to prevent military and police authorities from arresting the ringleaders. At the same time, the striking students would also return home to rest one after another, which would affect the "June 2nd" three-strike conspiracy. (2) The New Fourth Army plainclothes team from northern Jiangsu would sneak into Shanghai, arriving before June 2nd, in order to cooperate with each other to create incidents. The mayor said: If the CCP's conspiracy succeeded, there would be a large parade of 50,000 to 60,000 people on "June 2nd." Under the protection of plainclothes personnel with weapons, they would launch a riot. The security of Shanghai was unimaginable. The security authorities weighed the pros and cons, believing that it was better to wipe out the rioters in advance to prevent the outbreak of chaos, rather than using force to suppress them afterwards and cause the citizens to suffer fear. Therefore, there was the search and arrest operation. "June 2nd" has passed, but it is still difficult to be optimistic about the future. Therefore, only by uniting all citizens to protect their own safety can stability be achieved and prosperity reached. Commander Xuan, Fang Shengwei, and Speaker Pan then gave speeches in succession. The conference passed the charter, declaration, and proposals, and elected the directors and supervisors. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### Batch of Air Force Personnel Returned to Shanghai After Completing Studies: Received Rigorous Specialized Training in the United States

[Report from Our Newspaper] A batch of 212 Chinese Air Force personnel who were trained in the United States returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM aboard the General Aujtman. Reporters interviewed Major Ma Fukuan, the leader of the group, and Lieutenant Zhou Dingcai, a member of the group, about their training in the United States. It was reported that most of the returning Air Force officers and soldiers are ground crew personnel, some of whom were recruited in Kunming and Guiyang during the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, and some of whom were selected from the Air Force Mechanical School. They received specialized training in the United States, such as in mechanics, aerial photography, artillery, bombsights, and medicine. The length of the training varied depending on the subject, with mechanics taking over two years and others taking at least eight months. All officers and soldiers were first required to undergo three months of recruit training at Fort Sam Houston in Texas, the rigor of which far exceeded that in China. Many with slightly weaker physiques fell ill. After completing recruit training, they were assigned to airfields in Mississippi, Texas, Illinois, and Colorado to study specialized subjects. The training method focused on practice with less theory, but the discipline was extremely strict. It is estimated that the cost of teaching materials was about 20 to 30 US dollars per hour. Their living expenses in the United States were paid by our government, with officers receiving 140 to 190 US dollars per month and students and soldiers receiving about 60 US dollars per month. However, the students and soldiers received most of their clothing and food from the camp, while the officers had to take care of everything themselves and maintain their status by attending social events, which was a bitter experience. The attitude of Americans towards them has changed greatly due to the civil war in China, and they were often questioned about "why China is still fighting a civil war after the victory," leaving them speechless and very distressed. After returning to China, they will be assigned work by the Air Force Headquarters. There are still about 300 people receiving training in the United States, and another 100 or so who have completed training and will return to China in the near future.

The relevant local authorities of this city received the original telegram yesterday, which read as follows:

"Food is a necessity for the people's sustenance and must not be lacking. There must be absolutely no hoarding or manipulation to profit at the expense of the people. Recently, food prices have fluctuated greatly, causing immense harm to the people's livelihood.

For amounts of 100 shi of wheat or more, the Ministry of Food must be notified at any time for record-keeping purposes. For amounts of 200 shi or more, the Ministry of Food must be notified in advance for approval. Furthermore, banks shall not purchase and store grain on their own. (3) Legitimate grain merchants shall sell and supply the market at any time when purchasing and transporting grain and shall not hoard grain or deliberately raise prices. (4) The flow of grain between rural areas and urban areas shall be absolutely free. Local party, government, military, police agencies, and people's organizations shall not obstruct it.

Other agencies shall not interfere beyond their authority."

Rice Market Plunges, Flour Also Drops

[Another Report] The rice market continued to decline yesterday. Although there were many buyers, the market was sluggish, and the stores were fatigued. Therefore, the market fell as soon as it opened. By the close of the market, the prices of all goods had fallen by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Registered arrivals totaled 7,120 shi in the southern city and 1,890 shi in the northern city.

[Another Report] Yesterday, white yuan silk floss remained active due to the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, with stores preparing for sales, and the market was firm. However, there were still few buyers for medium and low-quality products. Flour sales were slow, and prices plummeted by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Wheat bran was stable, and small-package Zhejiang moved slightly, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales in rural areas were active, and the market was firm.

Red beans were traded sparingly, with prices decreasing by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

Red sorghum continued to weaken by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Corn was rarely traded in Tianjin, and the market plummeted, falling by another 10,000 yuan. Sesame, dominated by foreign firms, continued to rise, adding another 10,000 yuan.

New rapeseed appeared, but the market declined due to the sluggish oil market. The prices of high-quality new broad beans moved slightly, remaining generally flat. There were still few buyers for medium and low-quality products. New wheat from factories was accepted, and the market was fair.

The oil market fluctuated, with crude oil falling by 10,000 yuan, similar to soybean oil. Rapeseed oil was flat, but small-batch sesame oil rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

It is also rumored that Hankou will soon liberalize rice and grain trade, and Jiangxi will also gradually lift restrictions as the new harvest is earliest there. Hunan rice prices are also low, and Sichuan is already circulating rice. The food crisis has passed, and new wheat is gradually becoming more abundant, ensuring ample food supply.

### Chen Qitian Visits Mayor Wu and Inspects the China Textile Mill, Earnestly Trying to Persuade Dong Yunzhang to Stay

[Reported by This Newspaper] Minister Chen Qitian of the Ministry of Economic Affairs visited Mayor Wu at around 10:00 AM yesterday, leaving after a discussion at around 11:00 AM.

He insisted on resigning and asked Chen to appoint a capable successor. Chen offered comfort and earnestly tried to persuade him to stay. The company authorities previously stated that the company's operations should be realistic, its management methods should be commercialized, and its employees' treatment should be career-oriented. Chen sincerely accepted these points and promised to find ways to resolve the company's difficulties.

Chen believes that the Textile Construction Company is the only large-scale production institution in the country and that its achievements today were hard-earned. Therefore, he firmly urged Dong and others to continue their efforts and lead the company to continue production. Chen and his entourage then inspected the company's 17th Factory and the First Dyeing and Printing Factory, accompanied by Wu Weijing, and completed the inspection at 5:30 PM.

### Negotiations in Nanjing Yield No Results, China Stocks Collapse Again Yesterday

China stocks initially declined yesterday before stabilizing, but collapsed again near noon due to the lack of results from negotiations in Nanjing. Diyi Textile fell to its limit, while match stocks even stopped trading. Although the decline in small stocks was limited, trading was sparse and investor confidence was shaken. The morning opened with a slight decline. After Diyi Textile opened, Nos. 24, 85, 47, 71, 31, 218, 223, and 224 were sold to 5,850 yuan. Nos. 83, 65, 179, 75, and 36 took advantage of the low prices and reached 5,960 yuan. Nos. 47, 223, and 224 were sold again to 5,850 yuan. Nos. 61, 65, 91, 177, 148, 89, 163, 154, and 112 were all purchased, and No. 151 even purchased spot Yongsheng Textile, briefly pulling Diyi Textile up to 6,100 yuan. Nos. 235, 36, 224, and 155 took profits at high prices, falling back to within 5,900 yuan. At this time, investor confidence remained stable because the Hong Kong and Shanghai telegrams still showed 14.4 yuan. Nos. 152 and 190 were still being purchased, pulling prices back to the 6,000 yuan mark. After 11:00 AM, it was heard that Assistant Manager Gu had returned to Shanghai and that the proposal he carried had not been approved. Investor panic led to widespread selling. With little trading, Nos. 65, 46, 171, 224, 141, 186, 223, 234, and 143 were repeatedly sold, creating an oversupply. Near noon, Diyi Textile was forced down to 5,560 yuan, approaching its decline limit. Match stocks were suspended at their decline limit. Although small stocks declined, they generally traded sideways. Nos. 162, 129, and 207 took advantage of the low prices to purchase slightly. The noon closing price struggled around 5,600 yuan, and asking prices remained flat after the close. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, current delivery stocks such as Yongsheng Textile, Xinhua Trust, and Yonggong fell by about 10%, while Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and other stocks fell by 5%. Xinhua was the only stock that remained flat. Match stocks fell to their limit. Datong had a partial recovery after falling to its limit, down by 5%. Cement fell by less than 10%. Tongyi, Zhongsheng, Jinglun, Xinya Underwear, and Commercial Press each declined by 5%. Zhongsheng Textile and Lianyi declined but not by much. For current delivery stocks, Yongsheng Textile, Xinhua Trust, and China fell by about 10%, while Xinguang, Yonggong, Qin, and Jing fell by 5%. Old off-market stocks declined again.

### National Bonds Stable, Foreign Stocks Hover

Government bonds initially weakened before stabilizing yesterday. A major investor, Dong, purchased more than 4 million yuan. The supply from retail investors was not large, leading to this situation. National Bonds C opened at 6,800 yuan and then hovered higher, stabilizing after rising to 8,700 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, the rise and fall of all bonds were minimal, with a turnover of about 6-7 million yuan.

Although foreign investors purchased foreign stocks yesterday, the amount was not large. Securities firms still showed an appetite, while banks were selling. The Hong Kong and Shanghai telegram showed 14.4 yuan, which did not have much impact on the market. Yi Silk opened strong at 61,000 yuan and then declined to 57,000 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yi Silk and Steel fell, while British Union, Huade, Xingye, Guangdong Paper, Yi Beer, and Aviation each declined by 5%.

### Brokers Subscribing to U.S. Dollar Bonds, Ministry of Finance Does Not Allow Changes to Principles

The authorities stated that they deeply understood the difficulties currently faced by the brokers. However, the principles of the measures decided by the two ministries could not be changed. In terms of handling the measures, they might wait for the two ministries to consult and then formally send a letter to the stock exchange for verification. In addition, the four types of stocks applying for listing are also under review.

[Another Report] Wang Bitang and Wu Gongjing, resident supervisors of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs at the stock exchange, returned to Shanghai with Gu Shanchang yesterday morning.

### Regarding the Quota Allocation of Citizen Status and Other Issues, the Transportation and Management Committee Issues a Statement Regarding the Registration Standards for Manufacturers as Stipulated by the Executive Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Transportation and Management Committee issued a statement regarding: (1) the review and verification of importer registrations in Appendix 2, and (2) the allocation of imported goods in Appendix 2. The main points are summarized as follows:

(1) Regarding the registration of "Category A" applicants for goods in Appendix 2 due to insufficient quota allocation, it is deeply feared that inequality is the real problem, not scarcity. However, general manufacturers often misunderstand this due to failing the registration. However, according to the Committee, the registration standards were stipulated after repeated careful consideration by the Executive Committee, and the Registration Department implements the review based on these standards. As of the end of May this year, a total of over 500 manufacturers have registered for various goods, of which 60% are domestic manufacturers and 40% are foreign merchants. The claim of favoring foreign merchants is entirely unfounded. The roster of registered manufacturers for each category is kept in the Registration Department and is available for reference at any time.

(2) Regarding the allocation of quota goods for the first quarter, as of now, except for rayon and burlap bags, the rest of the goods, namely rice, wheat, and wheat flour, are under the overall control of the government. Coal and coke are allocated by the Fuel Management Committee. Ammonium sulfate, cement, fertilizer, and pharmaceuticals are temporarily suspended from import. Other goods requiring allocation have been handled separately.

The allocation standards are as follows: (1) Industrial raw materials that need to be centralized are directly allocated to factory users, with industry associations reviewing the capacity of each factory. Goods for centralized consumption are allocated to qualified registered importers. The Committee convenes a public negotiation with the importers to determine the quota on the spot. Because the situation of each commodity is different, some use the 1946 import volume as a benchmark, some refer to the pre-war import volume, some evenly divide a small portion, and the rest is allocated according to the agreed standards. The management capabilities of each merchant are also considered, and a minimum amount is stipulated, with the remainder calculated according to the standard.

The above allocations are all decided by the merchants themselves through negotiation, so there is no possibility or need for coercion. However, industrial goods with approved quotas must be sold to users, and sales contracts must be obtained and co-signed by the buyer's industry association before approval is granted.

### Kailuan Coal to be Transported to Shanghai

The Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is actively working to dredge the source of coal supply, starting with Kailuan. It is expected that at least 100,000 to 120,000 tons of Kailuan coal can be delivered to Shanghai by the end of this month. The transformation process is as follows: Recognizing that the Tangshan mining area and the Tianjin Railway Bureau urgently need flour, the Committee has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, requesting the Ministry of Food to instruct the Central Trust Bureau to sell some of its foreign flour stocks to encourage cooperation and seek various conveniences. The method is as follows: If 100,000 tons of coal are transported to Shanghai each month, the Central Trust Bureau will sell 80,000 bags of flour to the Kailuan authorities at market prices, and another 40,000 bags to the Beiping Tianjin Railway Bureau. If the total amount of coal shipped to Shanghai exceeds the quota, an additional 10,000 bags of flour will be sold to each of the above two institutions for each additional ton of coal.

Kailuan has abundant production, averaging about 14,000 tons per day, with stocks reaching over 200,000 tons. Furthermore, Shanghai's monthly regular demand is 160,000 to 170,000 tons, supplemented by sources from Northeast China and Taiwan. The coal shortage problem will be gradually resolved.

### A Glimmer of Hope for Tea Exports; A Batch of Old Tea to be Returned

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chinese tea is still favored overseas, but the asking price is exceptionally harsh, hindering the recovery of exports for a long time. Recently, several Chinese export firms, in order to actively expand their market, continue to endure losses and export, resulting in a faint glimmer of hope in the previously quiet trading with foreign firms yesterday. Various teas for domestic sale are being inquired about by both local and out-of-town merchants, and the situation is still good, stabilizing sentiment. Prices are slightly tighter than before.

[Another Report] Recently, rumors have spread in the market that over 100,000 pounds of Chinese tea will be returned from abroad. For this reason, the reporter paid a special visit to a prominent tea merchant yesterday. According to him, this is indeed the case. Several months ago, a certain tea export firm in the city shipped deteriorated old tea that had been stored for many years overseas. It is said that once the tea arrived, it was not welcomed by the locals and is now planned to be shipped back to China. Observing the current situation, with Chinese tea declining and Chinese tea merchants not realizing this, the future is worrying.

### Extensive Distribution of Goods; Difficulty in Reversing the Decline of Cigarettes

Yesterday, the cigarette market remained bearish. Dealers were reluctant to replenish their stocks, and the market's financial situation was tight, causing holders to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Ten sticks of Great British cigarettes traded at 6.25 million yuan, with very little trading. Even a slight drop to 150,000 yuan could only attract sporadic purchases. Old Knife cigarettes also lacked sales. In the afternoon, it was rumored that Yongtaihe would continue to distribute goods to local dealers next week, and He Cheng Company would also distribute twenty sticks of "Iron Tower" brand cigarettes, setting the market price at 4 million yuan for five thousand sticks, leading to even more sluggish market sentiment and weak trading. The closing price for ten sticks of Great British cigarettes fell again to 6.11 million yuan, a decrease of 155,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes also fell by 185,000 yuan, Five Hua cigarettes were stable, while other American strip cigarettes and Da Nan Wei Da San Pao cigarettes saw little trading. Only Chinese-made cigarettes had relatively firm sales due to strong demand.

### Stagnant Hardware Market

Hardware prices have not improved this week. Although manufacturers' wages have increased, and the prices of their products have also risen accordingly, they are unable to increase prices due to sluggish actual sales.

### Stable Chinese Medicine Market

After rising, the Chinese medicine market has stabilized. However, due to sluggish sales and falling prices, high-priced medicines are becoming a burden.

### Continued Decline in Yarn and Cloth Market

Yesterday, the yarn market declined because yarn factories were selling off their stocks, and importers were reluctant to absorb them due to the availability of foreign exchange for importing American cotton. Demand from this province was also weak, causing yarn prices to fall. The final price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 12.55 million yuan, a further decrease of 350,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 10-count Double Horse yarn opened strong at 7.75 million yuan, but due to weak trading and sluggish sentiment, the closing price fell slightly to 7.65 million yuan, a decrease of 130,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other yarn counts also fell by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened steadily. However, because dyeing factories found that processing dyeing was not profitable, they sold off white grey cloth. Importers were also hesitant because the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, and money was becoming tight. Additionally, due to the busy farming season in the countryside, actual sales were weak. Throughout the day, except for seasonal fabrics that were able to hold their ground, all 12-count and various grades of fine cloth fell by 2,000 to 5,000 yuan. Twill and serge fabrics also fell by 2,000 to 6,000 or 7,000 yuan.

### Cotton Market Conditions

Yesterday, American cotton futures rose, Indian cotton was stable. In the Shanghai spot cotton market, transactions were not very active due to tight money. Only Hengfeng Yarn Factory purchased 100 bales each of Shashi and Lao Hukou cotton for half a month, and Jiafeng Yarn Factory purchased 118 bales of Lingbao cotton, maintaining relatively firm prices.

### National Bank Industrial Loan Committee Approves Loans of 3.5 Billion

### Changchun Launches Major Mobilization: New Perspectives During the Defense War

— By Our Correspondent Fang Ren, Changchun, 2nd (Air Mail)

Changchun has become an iron city. This steel-like character is not only reflected in its fortifications but also in the morale and spirit of its people.

In May, exactly one year after the National Army recaptured Changchun, the Communist forces north of the Songhua River launched their fifth offensive, the so-called "Summer Offensive" or, as the captured Communists called it, "The Fifth Assault Across the River."

Changchun, a famous city south of the Songhua River, and Harbin, north of the river, are both resounding names. Since the Communists were "Assaulting Across the River," Changchun bore the brunt. Thus, in the northeast wilderness in May, just as the wind had rustled the branches, the lakes and rivers had barely thawed, and ripples and emerald waves had appeared, frogs were croaking serenades under the moonlight, and farmers had just leveled the paddies and were hurrying to sow the seeds, the Communist forces north of the Songhua River sounded their bugles, and the flames of war rose in the wilderness. The murderous waves swept from Fuyu in the northwest corner of Changchun to Fulongquan in Nongan. On May 17th, they swept south and overwhelmed Huaide, an important town west of Gongzhuling on the Changchun Railway. By the 19th, they had crossed Gongzhuling and Fanjiatun, north of Gongzhuling. At this point, Changchun was surrounded on three sides. Fierce battles broke out at Dafangshen, the airport on the western edge of the city, and Kuanchengzi, north of the city. The sounds of gunfire and artillery shells clearly echoed across the skies of Changchun for several days.

Numerous Extraordinary Experiences

The people of Changchun had been through a great fright. Among their numerous extraordinary experiences, although they had encountered four Communist offensives in the spring, they had never heard such intense and frequent gunfire and artillery shelling, nor had they felt such a suffocating atmosphere. The past year was still fresh in their minds. Events like the "May 23rd" and "April 14th" incidents, as well as the long and chaotic period from the "August 15th" liberation two years ago until last year's "May 23rd" incident, were simply not as threatening as the current three-sided encirclement of Changchun. This time, the "Tiger Tanks" seen during the "April 14th" incident were nowhere to be found.

However, this was a very moving scene: the people of Changchun, who had not been seen to do so before, launched a great mobilization to defend greater Changchun.

Building an Air Base in Four Days

During the War of Resistance, the slogan "Those with strength contribute strength, those with money contribute money" was often heard. This time, Changchun not only "contributed strength and money" but also "those with money contributed strength."

After voluntarily doing a great deal of logistical work, the city government issued an order on May 24th – the day after the anniversary of Changchun's recapture. Without coercion, it mobilized 100,000 people, who, with overflowing enthusiasm, built an air base within the city's defensive line in four days. It was larger than the Coral Airport in Chongqing, and constructed endless deep trenches and high ramparts outside the city's defensive line. They called these fortifications "trenches." Although the project was not yet fully completed when this article was submitted, 95% of the work had already been completed.

The Latent Power of New Actions

The participants in this project were Changchun citizens aged 18 to 51. They included shop assistants, artisans, students, civil servants, laborers, and even university professors. All of them wielded shovels, and in that scene, one could not help but understand the meaning of the idiom "unity is strength." In addition, it made one realize that the months of indifference had given them the latent power for today's actions, namely, the unforgettable disgust and hatred for certain ambitious individuals that had accumulated during the long and chaotic period from "August 15th" two years ago to "May 23rd" last year.

As of this writing, it cannot be said that Changchun is no longer in the midst of a defensive war. The flames of war have spread from the Songjiang River basin to the Liaohe River plain. Throughout the northeast, there are few places where the sound of bugles is not heard. However, Changchun has become an iron city. This "iron" is not only reflected in its fortifications but also in the morale and spirit of its people!

### Hailstorms Plague Henan Province; Large Ones Like Chicken Eggs, Small Ones Like Apricot Dates; The Whole Province is Filled with Mourning, Hoping for Effective Relief

— Kaifeng, 2nd (Dispatch) Our Correspondent Bo Quan

The people of Henan province have suffered greatly from the ravages of war, wandering and displaced. During this time, counties such as Xuchang, Wuzhi, Zhenping, and Yanshi have recently been repeatedly hit by hailstorms, with hailstones as large as chicken eggs and as small as apricot dates. With the wheat crop nearing harvest, this unexpected disaster has left the people wondering how they will survive. A summary of the hailstorm situation in each county is as follows:

Xuchang: The Northeast Suburbs Are the Worst Hit, Residents Cry Uncontrollably

On the afternoon of the 16th, a hailstorm caused disaster, with a dire situation in the east. In towns such as Balong, Xiaozhao, and Wujie in the northeast suburbs, many houses were destroyed by the hailstorm, and nine out of ten of the crops were destroyed. The entire region was filled with mourning, a heart-wrenching sight. The hailstones were as large as walnuts. The hailstones in the vegetable gardens were as high as the garden walls. In Shibei and Chenzhuang, five miles from the city, more than ninety of the hundred-odd houses were destroyed. Large trees that could be encircled by two arms were also felled. A resident named Chen in the village had only eight acres of wheat, which were now destroyed. Yesterday, he came to the city, crying uncontrollably, intending to commit suicide, which moved those who heard him to tears.

Wuzhi: Hailstorm Lasts 20 Minutes, Two Inches Thick and Six Li Wide

In Guyang Township in the east of the county, at around 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month, a strong wind suddenly blew, followed by a dense hailstorm with hailstones as large as apricot dates. It lasted for twenty minutes, and the accumulated hail on the ground was two inches thick, covering an area about six li wide and fifteen li long. All of the wheat crop was destroyed. With no hope of harvesting, the people cried to the heavens. In particular, they were burdened by extremely high grain prices, causing great panic in their lives. The area affected by the severe disaster is about 300 hectares. In other less affected areas, many wheat ears have also fallen to the ground and are not bearing fruit. It is hoped that the authorities will take measures to provide relief and reduce the burden on the people.

Zhenping: Black Frost Has Already Fallen Three Times, Now Hailstorms Also Wreak Havoc

On the 20th of this month, there was a heavy thunderstorm, and a hailstorm suddenly descended with extreme force. The towns of Chengyuan, Pengying, Xingshan, and Yuting were the most severely affected. The hailstones were as large as fists and as small as apricot dates. People and animals were injured and killed. The wheat, soybeans, and early autumn crops were all completely destroyed. The people cried out in despair. Zhenping had already experienced three black frosts in February, and now it has been hit by hailstorms. The people are truly unable to survive and urgently need help. It is hoped that the authorities will provide effective relief to maintain their livelihoods.

Yanshi: Most of the Wheat Ears Have Been Blown Off; Sweet Potatoes and Cotton Have Suffered Great Damage

Both the large and small wheat crops are nearing maturity. Unexpectedly, on May 15th, a strong wind arose, and within a day and night, most of the wheat ears were blown off. As of the afternoon of the 16th, the wind not only intensified but also brought hailstorms as large as apricots. All wheat, sweet potatoes, and cotton crops have suffered significant damage. According to preliminary investigations, the Mangling area is particularly severely affected.

### Talking about Vocal Music Appreciation

— You Ting

Since Jiang Ying's solo recital, I only felt that with my superficial musical knowledge and auditory experience, I couldn't possibly critique her singing achievements. However, it did spark some thoughts in me about "vocal music appreciation."

Understanding Authentic European Singing Art is Not an Innate Ability but a Subject of Study

The general Chinese public often prefers "Qingyi" in Peking opera and is less welcoming of "lyric sopranos." In particular, the "Aria" and "Recitative" in opera simply drive them crazy - even though they are the highest techniques in the world of vocal music.

Whether it's art songs or the "Arias" sung by major characters in European operas, the lyrics are often in Italian, German, French, or Russian (the United States and the United Kingdom have not made special contributions to musical art). If the audience does not have a considerable foundation in European languages, then naturally the singing of these authentic European songs will "fall on deaf ears." For example, Ms. Jiang's solo recital program included opera works by the German Mozart (Mozart's father was German, but Mozart himself was born in Austria), the French Bizet, and the Italian Puccini and Verdi. When you are in a solo recital, even if you can't master several languages, at least the pronunciation of those languages or the general meaning of the lyrics should be clear. Only then can you know whether the soloist's articulation is clear, the pronunciation is accurate, and the emotional delivery is appropriate.

Vocal music recitals mostly feature "Arias" from operas. If you usually don't care about the history of Western literature and its combination with music, and don't know which literary work or which Greek myth the opera content is taken from, how can you appreciate the performance of these opera selections? Jiang Ying's solo recital program included "Arias" from operas such as Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro," Verdi's "Il Trovatore," and Bizet's "Carmen." These are all famous opera composers from the 18th century onwards, from modern and contemporary times. A solo recital cannot be without the works of these great men. Listening to pure art solo recitals requires some literary knowledge, unlike listening to anti-Japanese war songs or ballroom music, which is much easier.

There is an unhealthy concept: believing that why should the Chinese only learn foreign songs? I think art should not have national boundaries. The thing that has the highest status and the most advanced techniques in the world of culture is shared by all mankind, regardless of which country it comes from.

After all, the musical arts of Germany and Italy have radiated brilliance to human culture. We can't think that those skills are not worth studying just because they originated from foreign countries. Even the United Kingdom and the United States have never thought like this.

(If we compare Chinese and Western songs, our language pronunciation is at a fundamental disadvantage.)

Secondly, appreciating a solo recital also requires understanding vocal music methods and techniques. This understanding is not based on your subjective perception of whether the sound is clear or whether the singing is graceful. You can't just "draw a final conclusion" to determine the soloist's performance. If it is a "lyric soprano," you should be able to hear whether her timbre and volume are appropriate. You should know the difference between a "lyric soprano" and a "dramatic soprano." In this regard, Jiang Ying is quite competent.

In the first piece of Jiang Xiaoru's solo recital, Gluck's "O del mio dolce ardor," you should discover how she applies the "touchstone" of European singing art – "the beautiful connection between the notes of yesterday and today." Then you can criticize.

In addition, you must have considerable judgment on the handling of techniques such as "vibrato," "staccato," and "penetrating sound," as well as the application of emotional changes. This judgment is not given by God but relies on your ear's experience and your innate "musical sensitivity."

Often, the solo recital itself is successful, but some people in the audience are just there to show their faces or smell the flowers. (Note: During the solo recital, the stage was filled with flower baskets, and the fragrance was refreshing.)

From the most superficial point of view, when appreciating Jiang Jun's solo recital, we can appreciate how skilled the soloist is in terms of singing posture and emotional delivery. In the first program, she adopted a normal posture (holding her hands tightly in front, moving them up and down), which aptly showed the passion of the song praising great "love." When singing the second piece, "Evening Sun Song," the tune was very peaceful, and her posture was also relaxed, with her right hand lightly supporting the piano and her left hand hanging down naturally. When she was called back (Encore) and sang two authentic Chinese folk songs, "Daoqing" and "Fengyang Flower Drum," her expression and movements were even more sweet and lovely, making people aware of her cultivation in opera. In terms of emotion, she also achieved "dissolving the emotional stimulation she got from the lyrics into every note," so the whole song showed varying shades of depth. Although these are very superficial conditions, they are techniques that every vocalist finds difficult to achieve perfectly.

Jiang Ying's solo recital made me think about the difficulty of vocal music techniques and the difficulty of appreciation.

### Viewing Miss Xiao Shufang's Art Exhibition (Two Essays)

1.  Sun Qiucao

Early summer is the season when grass flourishes south of the Yangtze River. After a long period of silence, several female artists' oil painting exhibitions have appeared one after another in foreign circles. Following Miss Tang Yunyu's exhibition at the Da Xin Gallery, Miss Zhang Liying held a pre-departure exhibition at the French Association Library, which was sincere in attitude and exquisite in content. Now Miss Xiao Shufang will exhibit her recent works at the Qingnian Hui Gengtang Hall. These are all exciting news.

Although we are in an era of suffering. In Shanghai, which is known as the national economic and cultural hub, when all social phenomena appear more indifferent, the general public regards art as nothing more than a luxurious decoration. And the concept of appreciating Western paintings is especially weak. However, an art creator who can be serious about themselves and bury themselves in their work in such a suffocating environment, their sincere and dedicated attitude is always worthy of respect.

Miss Xiao Shufang went abroad at an early age and spent a long time studying painting. Because the author has a good mastery of the techniques of garden painting, and is influenced by the Impressionist style that inspired new ideas in modern painting, the clear and changing style she expresses has aroused the appreciation of many connoisseurs.

From many compositions, the author especially loves children and flowers. Yes, in this world, besides the innocent smiles of children and the pure and flawless, flourishing flowers that symbolize happiness, peace, and tranquility, what else can evoke reminiscences from the bottom of one's heart more naturally?

However, we are still confined to an era of suffering, and all beautiful imaginations cannot conceal the misery we derive from reality. The realm of art needs to be explored, and the relationship between art and life is inseparable. I hope that art creators will reveal their true feelings and express them using their different techniques. Even if there is not necessarily such an achievement, one must have such a mind. I cherish every creator and cannot help but have such demanding expectations, and Miss Xiao Shufang is naturally no exception. In this way, my shallow views on a technically successful creator may not be regarded as reckless.

2.  Yu Lu

I remember when Miss Shufang held an art exhibition in London in the spring of the 28th year of the Republic of China, I wrote a newsletter and sent it to the Hong Kong National Daily for publication, recording that event from afar. At that time, Miss Shufang's works were mostly ink paintings, introducing the brushstrokes and style of Chinese art to an international audience, which won unanimous praise from the London society. However, Miss Shufang's art exhibition at the Qingnian Hui is her first time in China, and perhaps the general public is still unfamiliar with her, so after viewing her exhibition this time, I am willing to introduce her again.

Miss Xiao is the niece of the late Mr. Xiao Youmei, the former president of the National Conservatory of Music. She has loved art since she was a child and studied at the Beiping Art College and the Art Department of Central University, achieving remarkable results. She went abroad to study at the Paris and London Art Colleges, seeking further education. The oil paintings in this exhibition are mostly works created abroad and during her travels after returning to China, especially her deep love for the scenery of Switzerland and Beiping. Among the twenty-nine landscape paintings, sketches from the two places account for as many as seventeen. Other sketches were also created in Moganshan, Guling, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Paris, and London. In terms of ink paintings, there are also twenty-two landscape paintings, most of which are also sketches.

Secondly, in terms of portraits, they are all lifelike and vivid. The most admirable of these are the portraits of children, some sitting, some sleeping, and some breastfeeding, all of which capture their innocent and naive expressions with the brush and bring them to life on paper. In this exhibition, there are four oil portraits and thirteen ink portraits, most of which are not priced and are only for the audience to appreciate.

In terms of still life, flowers and plants are the most common, especially the bottle of flowers in the oil studio, which boldly uses bright colors and deliberately renders them without losing their realistic and lifelike charm.

Miss Xiao is a talented artist. Now is just the initial stage of her journey to the palace of art, and she has already achieved great accomplishments in both oil and ink painting. We should encourage her to work harder, accept more criticism, and let her talent be fully developed, shining brightly in the Chinese art world.

### Huangshan Painter Xu Shiqi

— Xu Zhongnian

Brother Shiqi is an old friend of many years, and I have seen many of his great works. However, my relationship with him progressed from a common colleague to a good friend due to something that seemed unrelated to art—even contradictory to art. Long before the War of Resistance, I went to visit Brother Shiqi one day. He said to me: "Brother Zhongnian, you've come at the right time. There's something you may not have seen before. There!" He pointed to a pile of flesh and blood. At first glance, it looked like a skinned rabbit, but his head told me it was a newborn baby! At that time, he was also the director of the Physiological Model Department of the Department of Health, and he was dissecting.

At that time, I had a feeling: all art takes emotion as its soul, and all science takes reason as its foundation. An art professor performing a dissection, is this not a contradiction? On closer thought, it is not. Emotion is not necessarily blind. Putting aside art for the moment, let's look at music and poetry, which are the most important emotions. Outside of "art," there is also "skill": emotion is the driving force of music and poetry, but the expression of this driving force must go through reason: emotion and reason do not conflict but complement each other here. So, why not let Xu Shiqi in the dissection room put down his butcher knife and immediately go to the treasure room to pick up a pen and paint?

Combining emotion with reason is such a delightful thing! How delightful and admirable it is to be able to harmonize emotion and reason without any separation! Therefore, I deeply understand Shiqi, and my friendship with him has deepened. In his paintings, this spirit of harmony and seamlessness between emotion and reason is fully expressed. Composition, brushwork, color, etc., are all rationalized, but everywhere is full of emotion.

He is from the foot of Huangshan: his eyes are full of scenery, his heart is full of paintings, he speaks to the guest and his brush moves, and the painting comes to his wrist. He is capable of anything in painting, and he especially remembers the scenery of Huangshan. Brother Chongpeng said: "Xu's landscape paintings like to create strange peaks and rocks, ancient pines and white clouds, which are the scenery of his hometown Huangshan; his brushwork is vigorous and mellow, with a similar effect to Mei Qing's mountains. His flowers and birds are between Lü Ji, Bian Wenjin, and Xinluo Baiyang. As for his figures, he focuses on sketching, with lively expressions, which benefits from his anatomical attainments, not by chance." I also think so of this Huangshan painter who skinned a baby.

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of Blood 528

Ye Jingfeng

In less than half an hour, Zheng Yan himself changed his plan, but did not rush back to Bai Ren Manor to attend the meeting. He only used the telephone to tell He Jian the most important secret message, and asked He Jian to let him stay in the telecommunications department to wait for other news and notify him at any time. He Jian of course agreed with Zheng Yan's proposal, and praised him for making real progress in his studies.

This important secret message from Zheng Yan was sent by "〇十二", saying that in Konoe's villa in Tokyo, there are now two largest "force flows" producing "sharp friction"; the so-called two "force flows" naturally refer to the army and navy. Because of this friction, Konoe's "expedition order" can only be temporarily suspended. However, this "temporary" is truly extremely temporary, at most only one or two hours, waiting for Konoe's men to negotiate the reasons and conditions for the friction between the army and navy, and after the two sides reach an agreement, the expedition order can be issued immediately; the Japanese garrison and spies in China can still launch an offensive on time.

While He Jian and the think tank of Bai Ren Manor were discussing the plan, Ping Zi was alone in a small guest room, arranging her arts. At the same time, outside the window of the small guest room, there were five or six pairs of eyes lurking in the dark, peeking intently. Among these five or six pairs of eyes, there were of course the four mischievous ones, one pair each, plus the youngest brother among the men of Bai Ren Manor, Tang Guanyi. He is the brother of He Jian and the head of telecommunications at Bai Ren Manor.

Ping Zi's arrangement was very simple. She pasted Elder Aoki's mysterious letter on a large square mirror, and this mirror was placed on a small round table for worship. Paper and pens were also placed on the table as preparation for recording inspiration and messages. Ping Zi finished the arrangement, turned off the lights in the room, and knelt quietly on a square stool that had been padded in front of the table, silently contemplating.

"Old Yue... big brother, hypnosis, or mentalism, or metaphysics, what are these things all about?"

He Jian received my urgent telegram and other secret messages from both sides, and rushed from Shanghai to Beiping. He told me everything that happened in Shanghai, and when he talked about Ping Zi and the old Jue Chang using mentalism to explore Elder Aoki's mysterious book, he suddenly asked me this question.

"You don't quite believe it, thinking it's too mysterious and too superstitious, right?" I didn't explain to him, but instead asked him this question.

"You say it's credible, but I've tried it myself a hundred times, and there's not one time that it works... I'll tell you, big brother, I did something embarrassing this time in Shanghai; maybe you won't believe it..." He Jian said here, and suddenly laughed himself.

"What's the embarrassing thing?"

"You don't know, after Ping Zi disappeared in Shanghai, I was so anxious about the mission of this trip. In the International Hotel, after Shouyi and the others left, before that fierce lady came, I suddenly thought of the trick of telepathy. I thought, why don't I use this method to find out Ping Zi's whereabouts? Fortunately, Ping Zi has used the trick on me, and I have used the trick to resist, we should be telepathically connected. Thinking of this, I immediately hypnotized myself. Do you know what the result was?"

"What was it?" I asked him curiously.

"The more I tried to hypnotize myself, the less I felt anything, and instead I fell sound asleep..." (He Jian)

"That may be because you were too tired."

"But if you don't believe in this stuff, it's a bit strange. Just take this time at Bai Ren Manor, I and their manor's think tank just drafted an outline of the plan, and the results of Ping Zi and the old Jue Chang's telepathic communication were all sent over for us to refer to..." (He Jian)

### Scenery of Huangshan

— Sun Fuxi

The scenery of Huangshan is unique and outstanding, and all visitors marvel at it. Mr. Xu Shiqi grew up at the foot of Huangshan, blessed by the spirits of famous mountains. He has climbed it since childhood, and has been especially inspired by the strange peaks and ancient pines. Therefore, his paintings and his personality are both full of lofty and transcendent spirits. Looking at his works, all landscapes have the ancient framework of Huangshan, and even his flowers and birds have the demeanor of being as stern as ice and frost, which is unattainable by ordinary people.

During the War of Resistance, Mr. Xu lived in Baishu Village, Shapingba, Chongqing. Several banana trees were planted in front of the door, and the silk shade filled the windows. In the studio, painting albums and paper, brushes, and pigments were displayed. After several years of diligent cultivation, he has made rapid progress. Hanging in the studio is a couplet written by Gao Luopei, a Dutch friend of Xu:

"The quiet heart has many mysteries, and floating thoughts are not common." This is truly a wonderful collection of sentences describing his personality and treasures.

Last autumn, Mr. Xu founded Huangshan Art Garden in Shanghai, with elegant arrangements, which is not only more spacious than his Chongqing Shapingba studio. In this elegant Art Garden, the host occasionally lectures and mentors students, and can especially calm his mind and paint in a relaxed and happy mood.

The noble character of Mr. Xu has been understood by readers. Now, I will copy another couplet written by He Zizhen in Mr. Xu's book as an ending:

"Listening to ancient music by the flowing water, admiring great sages when encountering towering mountains."

Although the times are different, the artist's mood and the unrestrainedness of his mind are conveyed between the lines.

Free Talk

### Random Talk

— Wang Cong

I am reminded of what a witty philosopher said:

"If a person's work is completed, his life will inevitably become a burden to him. Therefore, there is a second work to eliminate his life; the meaning of this is to reduce boredom."

"Boredom" is like an eagle flying in the sky. If it glimpses that life has obtained its needs, it prepares to seize.

Therefore, the first work is to engage in something that can be gained; the second work is to dispel the complacent emotions after gaining something; otherwise, life will become a burden.

I deeply like the above insights.

I feel that the reason why the current world is so sad is that most people have not yet completed the first work, and it can even be said that they have not yet started the work of "gaining something"; and a very small number of so-called "successful people" are already developing their second work, impatiently scratching their own monkey ears.

There are two Chinese idioms:

"Heavenly principles are originally without incident, but mediocre people disturb themselves."

I think the "mediocre people" in these two sentences probably refer to those noble people who are too idle.

"Boredom" is really terrible - it can corrupt human nature.

If God placed "boredom" and "hunger" in front of me and asked me to choose one of them, I would undoubtedly choose "hunger" and leave.

### The Fall of the Great Ming Empire — Miscellaneous Notes on Reading History, Part Six

— Xiao Dai

The dozen or so years before the Yongle period of the Great Ming Empire can be considered relatively peaceful. From the beginning of Yongle to the beginning of Chongzhen, a period of two hundred years, there was almost no year without war. By the end of the dynasty, due to the sharpening of the ruling forces' own corruption, coupled with years of famine, it reached the point where "fathers abandoned their sons, husbands abandoned their wives; some dug up grass roots to eat, and some dug up white stones to fill their hunger." The country was facing insufficient income and lack of military pay, which led to mutiny. As a result, those starving people and mutinous soldiers rose up in rebellion.

Among the leaders of this rebellion, the more notable ones were Gao Yingxiang, who called himself King Chuang, and Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, who called themselves General Chuang. They possessed thirty-six battalions with over two hundred thousand troops. Li Zicheng disturbed the Yellow River basin, and Zhang Xianzhong disturbed the Yangtze River basin. At its peak, they had a million troops, with 400,000 infantry and 600,000 cavalry, attacking cities and seizing land everywhere. In the process of the uprising, in order to gain popular support, Li Zicheng issued such military orders: "No one is allowed to hide silver, no one is allowed to live indoors in cities, and no women other than wives and daughters are allowed to be taken along", "Anyone who has a horse mixed in the ranks will be beheaded, and anyone whose horse tramples on fields will be beheaded", "The daughters and treasures of the captured cities will be divided equally." It is said that such military orders had a great effect. By March of the seventeenth year of Chongzhen, the rule of the Great Ming Empire had completely collapsed. The History of Ming records:

"On the eighteenth, the rebels attacked even more fiercely. Zicheng stationed outside Zhangyi Gate and sent the surrendered eunuch Du Xun to see the Emperor, seeking abdication. The Emperor was furious and scolded him. He issued an edict for a personal expedition. At dusk, the eunuch Cao Huachun opened Zhangyi Gate, and the rebels all entered. The Emperor left the palace, ascended Coal Hill, and, seeing the beacon fires reaching the sky, sighed and said, 'It is my people who suffer!' He lingered for a long time, returned to Qianqing Palace, ordered the Crown Prince and Prince Yong to be sent to the residences of his relatives Zhou Kui and Tian Hongyu, struck the eldest princess with his sword, and urged the Empress to commit suicide. On the nineteenth, Dingwei, before dawn, the Imperial City was not defended; gongs were sounded to gather the officials, but none came. He then ascended Coal Hill again, wrote his last will on his clothing, and hanged himself from a pavilion on the hill. The Emperor then collapsed."

At this time, the Manchus saw the internal chaos of the Ming Dynasty and took the opportunity to rise up. Before starting the war, they made peace with Korea, and the campaign against Mongolia also achieved considerable results, so they had no worries behind them. Therefore, they advanced south with all their forces. The Manchu's call to take the opportunity to attack the Han originated in "the Ming's closed-door policy cut off the lifeline of Manchu merchants; and officials arbitrarily lowered prices, and tax supervisors arbitrarily imposed harsh levies, causing hatred among Manchu merchants" (Zhou's General History of China). Just as the Manchus were gradually advancing, the father of Wu Sangui, the general of Shanhaiguan, Wu Xiang, was captured by Li Zicheng, who forced him to write to Sangui and persuade him to surrender. It is said that Sangui originally intended to surrender to Li, but later heard that his beloved concubine Chen Yuan (Yuanyuan) was looted by Liu Zongmin, and became so angry that he asked foreign tribes to oppress his own kind. The Ming History, Biography of the Rebel Liuzei, records:

"Zicheng... heard that Wu Sangui, the general of Shanhaiguan, had raised troops, and planned to return to Shaanxi. Initially, Sangui received an edict to enter the defense, and arrived at Shanhaiguan. The capital fell, and he hesitated to advance. Zicheng kidnapped his father Xiang to write a letter to recruit him. Sangui wanted to surrender, but when he reached Yongping, he heard that his beloved concubine Chen Yuan had been looted by Liu Zongmin, and he was very angry. He quickly returned to Shanhai and attacked and defeated the rebel general. Zicheng was furious, led more than 100,000 rebels, held Wu Xiang in the army, and attacked Shanhaiguan in the east, sending another general across the pass at Yipianshi. Sangui was afraid, and begged to surrender to our Great Qing."

The Manchus were suffering from not being able to enter the mainland of China, and Wu Sangui, just to avenge this private grudge, under the slave thought of "rather lose to a foreign tribe than give to a domestic slave", opened Shanhaiguan wide. As a result, the Great Ming Empire and the "domestic slaves" were finished together, allowing the Manchus to rule China for more than two hundred years.

### Nazi Jokes — About Ship Names

— Bao

It is the custom of the British Navy that the name of every officer should be registered on the ship's register. Since the Naval Aviation Force belongs to the Navy, its officers must also be registered on the ship's register, but some of their land bases are not ships. Therefore, these bases took ship names to accommodate the uniformity of the regulations.

During this war, the British spared no effort in conducting broadcasting duties. Regarding the origin of ship names, the Nazi broadcaster made a joke. HMS Kestrel was originally the name of a British Naval Air Force base. In September 1940, the Nazi radio station broadcasted: "The British magnetic HMS Skyler was bombarded by the German Navy and has sunk." This news became a big joke in the Allied naval circles.

### Premonitions Are Not Mysterious

— Ni Qiuping

Now I want to say that the sixth sense is not some mysterious miracle. Whether the professor who has studied it for seventeen years has used some new theory to absolutely complete the method of premonition.

As far as I know, that premonition is what is called clairvoyance or thousand-star eye Telepathy. People with some knowledge of hypnotism Hypnotism know that it is extremely ordinary. However, there must be a hypnotic subject, given appropriate suggestion Suggestion to make it very easy for laymen to be surprised. We can perceive things that are invisible to the naked eye. It's like sealing something up and having the subject answer on the spot, and he can immediately and accurately tell us. This is the miracle of space, and there is also the miracle of time.

In Buddhism, there are many materials available for research. However, formal Buddhist believers do not pay attention to that kind of supernatural power. We don't have to think that this is a superstitious thing. What a pity is that generally people with a smattering of knowledge think that it is unscientific. Maybe after a few years, we can guess the riddles of space and time.

### Visiting Mei Lanfang (3)

— Feng Zikai

My idea of visiting Mei was to see the original appearance of this special masterpiece of creation. God created people, and there are masterpieces in all departments of mankind, so there are heroes in the military and political circles, and heroes in the academic world. However, their magic weapons are mostly all in the spirit, not in the body. That is, it is all in the effort of operation, command, painstaking effort, and solitary study, not in the sound and appearance. (So there are often products)) Only the "King of Actors" has his magic fully in the body itself. Beautiful singing and gorgeous postures are all expressed from this clever machine - the body. Isn't this the Creator's "special" masterpiece? Therefore, heroes are not worth visiting, but the King of Actors should be visited to see the original appearance of this ingenious machine after removing the makeup.

One spring afternoon, in a quiet洋樓 (Western-style building), Mr. Mei and I sat face to face on two sofas. As usual, during the greetings, I couldn't believe that this was the King of Actors on stage. Only from the fullness of his eyes, can I vaguely imagine the faces of Yu Ji and Gui Ying. I looked closely at his face and felt that the bones were indeed very well-formed. Looking at his body, it was also just right in terms of height, shortness, fat, and thinness. The Western standard of the human body is the Greek Venus, and there are also plaster models of her circulating in China. I think: according to the standards of human beauty, Mei Lang's figure and appearance are probably close to Venus, and he is qualified to have the Eastern standard human body. He was very happy to talk to me, and his natural voice was loud and sticky. From this, I can also vaguely imagine the tones of "clouds converge on the clear sky, water ripples surge" and "children can't bear to leave their fathers."

From his happy talk, I learned how he painstakingly avoided the occupation period and how he escaped from Hong Kong. It is said that he was able to escape thanks to an officer among the enemy soldiers in Hong Kong who said that his mother had taken him to see Mr. Mei's performance in Tokyo when he was a child, and he had a good impression of him. I also learned that his burden was very heavy, and many opera performers had to be supported by him, and his life was not rich. At this time, his landlord was evicting him, and several gold bars were required to renew the lease. He said to me with emotion, "Where can I get a few gold bars from the money I earn from performing!" I was very surprised why his words touched me so much. After careful study, I realized that he liked to use hand gestures to help him speak; and these gestures were very natural, which ordinary people could not do!

### Beside the Bed

— Ye Lin

The ancients had a saying to alert us: "How can others be allowed to sleep soundly beside the bed?"

Even sound sleep is not allowed, let alone people being awake and trying to do something. How can we rest easy on our bed?

Looking at recent newspaper reports, the Japanese government sent a letter to MacArthur presenting its views on the peace treaty, requesting preferential immigration rights in Taiwan and requesting civilian control of the Ryukyu Islands and joint management with the United States. This is truly outrageous. A Japanese newspaper also reported that the Japanese ship Daishin Maru invaded our country's territorial waters and was seized by our customs in Weitouao. This is also no ordinary event. As for MacArthur's support for Japanese overseas trade and light industry, and Japanese fishing boats fishing in our country's coastal waters, and the recent influx of Japanese goods into our country under the name of American manufacturing, this series of events makes us feel even more pressure. Militaristic Japan is lurking beside our bed and actively acting. This is worth our vigilance.

In history, it is probably unheard of for a surrendered country to ask the victorious country for the special rights of co-management and immigration. If there is one, Japan should be the first to be mentioned. Here, we see Japan's ambitious attempt to retain its "stepping stone" in the South Pacific. Here, we can also see the shadow of a hundred years of history.

Learning from history, how much we need to be vigilant at all times beside the bed—

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

With great difficulty, the child was revived within five minutes. But by this time, the engines of the four trucks had begun to roar like tigers. He looked down at Feifei, who was already crying, but her eyes were still not open, and her mind was still confused, so he dared not leave her. After another minute or two, Lü Qian limped over with one leg, panting, and handed a cup of lukewarm boiled water to Lao Zhu, who slowly fed it to Feifei. Unconsciously, another three or four minutes passed.

"Mom! I want Mom...!" Feifei finally opened her eyes and pleaded, shouting loudly.

"Okay, Uncle Zhu will hold you!" Lao Zhu snatched her up from the ground and rushed towards the four trucks that had already started moving.

Lan and Zhang Chang's vehicle was in the second position. By the time Zhu Zhaonian rushed out of the crowd with Feifei in his arms, the third vehicle had already rolled past them. Holding a deeply ominous regret in his heart, Lao Zhu disregarded his life and chased desperately along the road. His rapid panting and Feifei's trembling cries merged into a piercing rhythm that stirred the heart and lungs.

Finally, although he勉强managed to catch up with the third vehicle, he could see the tail of the second vehicle. However, Lan was half-lying on the luggage pile, her position was particularly low, and her whole body was正好blocked by a horizontal board at the back of the truck. The exhausted Lao Zhu wanted to run and hold Feifei high, so that she could see her mother again, but he實在was unable to do so. He felt that it was useless to continue chasing, and his pace gradually slowed down.

Zhang Chang, who was standing on the truck, suddenly discovered them and waved his hand wildly.

"Feifei!" Lao Zhu finally stopped, panting, while also forcing a smile, and looked down to explain to Feifei, who was crying incessantly: "We can't catch up! Anyway, we're leaving tomorrow, and we'll see your mother as soon as we get to Hechi."

But Feifei closed her eyes and cried.

The third and fourth vehicles quickly overtook them and drove on, the yellow sand billowed, and soon their shadows disappeared one after another at the corner of the road. Only a faint and intermittent harmonica tune could still be heard blowing in the wind.

Zhu Zhaonian slowly lowered his head, looking at Feifei's face covered with tears, and remained silent, his heart filled with boundless melancholy.
