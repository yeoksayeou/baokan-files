### Provisional Committee to be Established by the Executive Yuan to Implement the Sino-American Relief Agreement and Distribute Materials Jointly by Government and Private Sectors

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Yunwu, told reporters on the 7th that the Executive Yuan will establish a provisional committee to be responsible for liaising with the United States and to oversee the implementation of the Sino-American Relief Agreement. This organization is currently being established under his guidance and will be realized in the short term. Its main task is to plan, while the distribution of relief materials will be carried out jointly by government agencies and private charitable organizations to achieve efficiency. In addition, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of relief materials will also be allocated to develop private charitable relief undertakings to ensure their widespread reach. Mr. Wang stated that the senior official referred to in Article 2, Paragraph C of the Sino-American Relief Agreement, who is to be appointed by China to liaise with U.S. representatives to implement the relief plan, will be a political appointee from a ministry without portfolio of the Executive Yuan. However, he refused to disclose the person's identity. According to our sources, Peng Xuepei, former Deputy Director of the Wartime Production Board, and Miao Jiaming, a Southwest entrepreneur, are the most likely candidates.

[United Press International, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Deputy Secretary of State Lovett replied that only a small number of government officials have read the Wedemeyer Report. Secretary of State Marshall also told reporters: "I don't think there is any greater need to publish this report than to publish my private conversations with President Truman."

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th Dispatch] Senator Brewster, Chairman of the Senate War Investigating Committee, said on the 7th that he believed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would "demand" to read Wedemeyer's secret report on China, as "the situation in China is at least as important as that in Europe." He said that the reason for keeping the report secret may be that it contains a great deal of criticism of the Chinese government and situation, "but what right do we have to condemn the corruption of the government? There are also a large number of corrupt elements in the U.S. government." Senator Wilson, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the State Department's refusal to provide the Wedemeyer Report, saying that Congress should first understand all the facts regarding future appropriations. "If the State Department rashly hides the news, preventing the American people and their legislative body from understanding, how can we blame the iron curtains in other countries?"

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th Dispatch] The Washington Post strongly criticized Marshall in today's article for failing to clarify U.S. policy toward China and the State Department's attitude toward other world problems at yesterday's press conference.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 6th Dispatch, Associated Press] It is reported that the United States has agreed to purchase rice worth $5 million to relieve China. This batch of rice can be purchased within two months. Furthermore, Thailand has also agreed to sell 20,000 tons of Siamese rice to China in mid-December.

### Foreign Minister Wang Comments on U.S.-Soviet Relations, Emphasizes Importance of Northeast China, France Makes Conditional Concessions on the Xisha Islands Issue

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang attended a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Senate on the morning of the 7th and reported on the general diplomatic situation, divided into five points: 1. The process of attending the United Nations General Assembly; 2. The veto issue; 3. The Japanese peace treaty issue; 4. Sino-American relations; 5. The Korean issue. Regarding Sino-American relations, Mr. Wang said that the attitude of people in the United States, both in and out of government, is gradually improving. U.S. Senator Vandenberg's advocacy that aid to China should be included in the European aid plan is sufficient to illustrate the change in the U.S. attitude toward aid to China. Mr. Wang believes that there will be a better performance at the U.S. congressional special session on the 17th. Mr. Wang stated that after returning from the United States and meeting with MacArthur in Japan, his impression of MacArthur's policy of governing Japan, after on-site inspection, has been further understood. After Mr. Wang's report, Senators Yin Shuxian and Zheng Kuiyi raised questions. Someone asked about the Philippines' opinion on the Ryukyu Islands as reported in the Philippine newspapers, and what the government's position is on this. Mr. Wang replied that this was only seen in the newspapers, and the Philippine government had not expressed its position. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had instructed the ambassador to the Philippines to inquire, and the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied having expressed any opinion. Someone asked about the issue of receiving Dalian and Lushun. Mr. Wang said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently handling the matter.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] Reliable sources have learned that Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported at the Standing Committee of the Senate on the morning of the 7th that only the success of the Marshall Plan in Europe can force the Soviet Union to change its policy. Senators should not be overly concerned about American aid and neglect the stalemate in Northeast China. The situation in Northeast China "may be more important than American financial and economic assistance." The United States is planning to unite world opinion to force the Soviet Union to change its policy, but so far there is no sign of change. The Soviet Union intends to unite the communist forces in Europe to defeat the Marshall Plan. After the special session of the U.S. Congress convenes, this plan should be passed. It is difficult to say whether the Marshall Plan can overcome difficulties and achieve its goals. However, the success of this plan will force the Soviet Union to revise its attitude on international politics. Mr. Wang made no mention of the Wedemeyer Report or the U.S. aid negotiations, but only said that American public opinion has a further understanding of the China issue, as can be seen from Vandenberg's speech (unconfirmed news says that Mr. Wang predicted that U.S. aid to China would be clarified within two months). China is currently in urgent need of assistance, "but looking further ahead, we find that a problem more important than U.S. aid" is the Northeast issue. Unless the issue is resolved, there will be no peace in China and the Far East. In Washington, he had long talks with Truman and Marshall on this matter. He told them that China fought against Japan and signed a treaty with the Soviet Union, trying to cooperate with the Soviet Union to solve the Chinese Communist problem politically, for the sole purpose of resolving the stalemate in Northeast China. Although China has worked tirelessly, "the result is greatly disappointing." It is hoped that the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union can have a spirit of cooperation and mutual concession when discussing the German peace treaty at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. If such a spirit cannot be found, some countries may conclude a peace treaty separately. Mr. Wang also discussed the Japanese peace treaty, the Korean issue, Japanese internal affairs, and MacArthur's policy, which were the same as those published to the press.

[Another Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported in writing to the Standing Committee of the Senate on the morning of the 7th that regarding the Xisha Islands, France has made some conditional concessions, but the nature of the concessions was not specified. The French Embassy here stated that there was no news about new developments in the Xisha Islands case. After the war, both China and France declared the Xisha Islands to be their territory. Chinese troops landed on several islands, while French troops occupied another island. France suggested that the matter be resolved by international arbitration, which was rejected by China, and the case became a pending issue.

### Standing Committee Meeting Passes Six Important Cases

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] The Standing Committee of the Senate held a regular meeting on the morning of the 7th, chaired by Jiang Yong. After Foreign Minister Wang's report, proposals were discussed. The proposal to convene the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Senate, which was originally planned to be submitted for discussion, was not submitted. The cases are recorded as follows: 1.

### General Election Will Not Be Postponed Again, Party Candidates Can Be Supplementally Announced

Names of Election Committee Members Found to Have Been Removed from Kuomintang List

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] According to explanations from authoritative sources, the date of the general election will definitely not be postponed again in terms of legal principles due to the slightly delayed announcement of party candidates, as the announcement of candidates in accordance with the general election procedure has been carried out by the General Election Office and various provinces and cities on the 6th. Party candidates who are yet to be announced can be supplementally announced according to law and are not necessarily required to be announced 15 days before the election. [Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] The list of party nominations for candidates for the National Assembly was not submitted on the 7th. The procedures for the Kuomintang part have been completed by the General Election Office, and it is now waiting for the lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to be sent for announcement. The list of the Democratic Socialist Party was taken to Shanghai by Xu Chuanlin, Jiang Yuntian, and Ta Junming on the 7th to convene the Central Standing Committee of the party. On the 7th, they returned to Nanjing with written opinions discussed and decided, and handed them over to Wu Tiecheng at around 8 a.m. Democratic Socialist Party officials stated that when the party submitted the original list, it submitted a memorandum stating that any changes must be agreed upon with the party first. The disorganization of the list without consultation is regrettable in the spirit of cooperation between the two parties. Someone also emphasized that if there is any delay in the general election, the Kuomintang should be fully responsible. However, according to the latest news, the lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party may be submitted on the 8th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] Xu Chuanlin, Jiang Yuntian, and others from the Democratic Socialist Party returned to Beijing from Shanghai this morning. Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng visited Xu this afternoon, and Xu returned the list of candidates for the National Assembly previously submitted by the Democratic Socialist Party and attached a letter from Zhang Junmai. It is reported that the Democratic Socialist Party cannot agree with the Kuomintang's arrangements for the party's candidates due to the allocation of personnel and regions, not the number of seats. The party believes that more than 70 important members of its nominated list have not been listed as candidates, while more than 40 people whom the party considers unimportant have been included. As for the number of seats, although the Kuomintang does not currently arrange the promised number, it stated that it has reserved a number of seats in several buffer zones, so the Democratic Socialist Party has no objection to this. Chen Lifu also visited Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party this afternoon to discuss matters. The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have now resubmitted the list to the Kuomintang for consideration. The meeting of the conveners of the various review groups of the Central Election Guidance Committee of the Kuomintang was held at 8:30 p.m. tonight to discuss the issues raised by the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 7th Dispatch] It is confirmed that among the list of National Assembly candidates nominated by the Kuomintang, including Kuomintang members and social notables, 28 are incumbent members, supervisors, or staff of election authorities at all levels, and are subject to restrictions in accordance with Article 28 of the Implementation Regulations of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law. After verification, the General Election Office has removed them and requested the Kuomintang to submit replacements.

Hong Kong Government to Assist Our Anti-Smuggling, Ships Sailing Need to Obtain Examination Form First

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th Dispatch] In response to the request of our government, the Hong Kong government announced today that all ships sailing to ports in China should first obtain an examination form from the Marine Department. This small form will be officially stamped and signed by the Marine Department when issuing port clearance permits. This rule only applies to ships sailing from here to ports in China and goods loaded here and transported to ports in China, and does not apply to goods loaded elsewhere and transported to China via here or goods loaded here and transported to places outside of China. The new rules are intended to make it easier for Chinese customs to take measures to prevent smuggling, as Chinese customs have encountered some difficult problems with manifests transported from here to China. The Hong Kong government explained in a formal statement that there is reason to believe that all ships sailing from here to ports in China have obtained normal manifests here, but some ships often unload part of their cargo en route and smuggle it into China. Therefore, when these ships arrive at Chinese ports and submit their manifests for inspection, the customs authorities find that their manifests do not match those issued by the Hong Kong authorities.

Editorial

### Can the Four-Power Conference Break the European Deadlock?

The foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to open a meeting in London on the 26th of this month to continue discussing peace treaties with Germany and Austria, so that Europe can restore a state of peace as soon as possible. To facilitate the progress of their work, the foreign ministers of the four countries have sent representatives to London to hold a meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers. According to a report by the United Press, the representatives of the foreign ministers of the four countries began their difficult work in a pessimistic atmosphere on the 6th of this month, in order to find a four-country agreement on the future of Germany and Austria. However, because the opinions of the four powers are so different, like traveling south to reach the north, most political commentators believe that this meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers may not be able to break the current European deadlock. However, observing the current situation in Europe, since the emergence of the New Communist International, the division of Europe has become more evident; the confrontation between the two major camps is becoming increasingly serious. If no measures are taken to remedy the situation and prevent the collapse, the future of Europe will be very bleak. The foreign ministers of the four countries, whether for their own interests or for the welfare of all European countries, have the necessity to meet at this time to find ways to save the European crisis. Therefore, all countries in the world attach great importance to this meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers and believe that this is a major key to whether the foreign ministers of the four countries can break the European deadlock.

Before the representatives of the foreign ministers of the four countries arrived in London, there was once optimistic news spreading internationally. According to a United Press dispatch from Berlin on the 3rd, well-informed sources from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union in this area have changed from pessimistic to optimistic about the future of the upcoming four-power foreign ministers' meeting, and believe that the meeting will at least achieve partial success. They also pointed out several optimistic factors: 1. The Soviet press's attacks on the United Kingdom and the United States have become milder; 2. The Soviet Union will make concessions to avoid deepening the divide between the East and West blocs; 3. Soviet diplomacy will undergo changes, and personnel will also be changed; 4. The Soviet Union cannot and does not want to go to war at present. Therefore, it is believed that the foreign ministers of the four countries may reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues. This optimistic view is welcomed by those of us who desire world peace, and we hope that it can be realized. However, objective facts, especially the "cold war" that the United States and the Soviet Union are currently engaged in, and the lack of any signs of the two sides washing their hands, still prevent us from being too optimistic.

Since the surrender of Germany, the war in Europe has ended, and it has been two years and three months to this day, but it has not yet returned to a state of peace, and the problems after the war are endless and have not been properly resolved, causing Europe to fall into worry. Although the diplomats of the great powers have exhausted their wisdom and ability and repeatedly convened international conferences in an attempt to reach an agreement, they have never succeeded. When we study the crux of the problem, it is very clear that the German and Austrian issues are the core of today's European problems. If this major problem cannot be solved, then there is no way to solve other problems. In mid-March of this year, the foreign ministers of the four countries met in Moscow, wanting to discuss the principles of the peace treaties with Germany and Austria, but after 45 days of discussion, they only wasted the diplomats' words and achieved almost nothing. In the end, two resolutions were passed: 1. A four-power committee was established to hold its first meeting in Vienna on May 12 to discuss the differences in opinions of the four powers on the peace treaties with Germany and Austria; 2. The next meeting of foreign ministers of the four countries was scheduled to be held in London in November to continue discussing the main issues that caused disagreements between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, such as the disarmament of Germany, the movement and exchange of population, and the economic unification of Germany. The foreign ministers of the four countries dealt with the matter perfunctorily, and the Moscow meeting came to an end. By mid-May of this year, although the Four-Power Committee was held as scheduled, it did not achieve concrete results, so the world's attention turned to the UN General Assembly in mid-September. However, at Lake Success, we only heard the verbal battles of the US and Soviet representatives, and only saw the diplomatic war between the US and the Soviet Union. Also, because of the veto power issue, the US proposal to establish a 57-nation standing committee led to a stalemate in the second UN General Assembly. At that time, representatives of the communist parties of nine European countries secretly met in Warsaw, issued a declaration, and established the New Communist International, openly raising the banner of anti-imperialism in an attempt to undermine the implementation of the Marshall Plan for European aid. As a result, the European situation suddenly changed and caused two violent reactions. On the one hand, the United States accelerated the implementation of the European aid plan; on the other hand, the politics of the three Western European countries, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy, shifted to the right. The results of the municipal council elections in the United Kingdom and France are a strong illustration. The divide between the two major blocs in the East and West is deepening, which is enough to deepen the European crisis and expand the rift between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rumors that the United States declared war on the Soviet Union once spread in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, which shows the fragility of the Europeans' nerves and that they can no longer withstand any nerve warfare. However, the Soviet Union is unwilling to stop its so-called nerve warfare, which is truly a major tragedy of the post-war world.

The Soviet representative Vyshinsky repeatedly putting the label of "war monger" on the heads of American political diplomats at the UN General Assembly was enough to stimulate the nerves of the world. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution stated that atomic secrets no longer exist and pointed out that the United States surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases and harbored aggressive intentions. Is this the Soviet Union launching a nerve war offensive against the United States? Not only is it enough to disrupt the peaceful atmosphere in the international arena, but it is also enough to hinder the progress of the meeting of representatives of the foreign ministers of the four countries. We ultimately believe that Molotov's release of such stimulating remarks on the eve of the opening of the meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers is inappropriate and will cause the world to once again lose confidence and hope in the meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries. According to a United Press dispatch from London on the 6th, the United States has drafted a plan that can be submitted as soon as the meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries reaches a deadlock. It is said that the content is that the United States will make a separate peace with Germany outside the Soviet occupation zone. We assume that if the future evolution really reaches this point, the division of Europe cannot be saved.

However, on the other hand, loving peace is the universal psychology of the world today. Regardless of nationality, race, gender, age, there is no one who does not desire peace. This is the conscience of mankind and the only force to maintain peace after the war is enough to overcome any dark forces. We have great confidence in this. As long as everyone has this conscience and everyone has this self-awareness, the international current is certainly terrible, but it is not difficult to reverse the situation. Therefore, we still have unlimited hope for the US Secretary of State Marshall, who arrived in London four days early to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference and made the greatest efforts for European peace. Marshal Ma's answer to reporters on the 5th, "I cannot express pessimism when the war is still going on," is really thought-provoking, and Marshal Ma's bold words are the only comfort for peace-loving people.

### Matters of Understanding in the Exchange of Notes between China and Italy

(Continued from Page 1) Regarding the solution of the problem of war damages arising from the war between China and Italy, the exchange of notes states that China and Italy have reached the following understandings:

The Chinese government has automatically decided to waive its right to invoke the provisions of Article 79 of the peace treaty signed in Paris on February 10, 1947, and will limit its claims to: A. Compensation for damages suffered by Chinese nationals in Italy during the war; B. Reimbursement of expenses paid by the Chinese government to maintain the lives of Italian nationals in China.

In order to fully resolve the above requirements, the Italian government undertakes to compensate the Chinese government: A. 100 million Italian lira; B. An additional US$18,498.16.

The exchange of notes between China and Italy regarding the handling of certain Italian government officials and Italian侨产业 in China states that China and Italy have reached the following understandings:

The Chinese government, in accordance with the laws and regulations it implements, recognizes the Italian government's rights to the following properties: A. The buildings and land of the Italian consulates in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou; B. The buildings and land of the Italian clubs in Shanghai and Tianjin and their accessories; C. The buildings within the former site of the Italian Embassy in Beiping (excluding the former barracks).

The Chinese government agrees to allocate to the Italian government the land within the former embassy boundary in Beiping where the former Italian embassy building is located. The Italian government shall be entitled to use it for public purposes.

The Chinese government will grant Italian nationals the same treatment as is now or will be granted to the nationals of Allied or neutral countries with respect to their property rights held in China.

### Supplementary Regulations for the Election of National Assembly Delegates and Legislators Passed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The "Supplementary Regulations for the Election of National Assembly Delegates and Legislators" related to elections in pacification areas, after two discussions in the Legislative Yuan and after several reviews, were passed by the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 7th. This case was submitted by the State Council for discussion. During the 337th General Assembly of the Legislative Yuan, the following two points were unanimously approved: 1. When a region or a group organized according to administrative regions cannot hold elections at all, voters may register and vote according to law in neighboring regions or designated places; 2. When a region or a group organized according to administrative regions cannot hold elections in part, the competent election authority in the region shall conduct elections according to Item 1 for the part that cannot be held. However, there was considerable controversy in the meeting as to whether elections should be re-run in accordance with the election law after all constituencies have been recovered. After review by the Constitution and Legal Regulations Committee, it was decided to stipulate in Article 5 that when a region or a group organized according to administrative regions can conduct elections according to law in its entirety, general elections shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the respective election and recall laws, and the date of the election shall be determined by order of the National Government.

The foregoing provision shall not apply to the scope of areas where elections cannot be held in part, where the area is less than one-third or where the area is more than one-third but the population is less than one-third.

Liu Kezhang, convener of the Constitution and Legal Regulations Committee, explained the review process today, pointing out that the original draft stipulated that the election date would be one year, but now it is stipulated that it would be determined by order of the National Government. This is a regulation based on reality. The case was passed according to the review opinions after a brief discussion.

### Separate Supplementary Laws and Regulations Will Be Formulated for the Selection of Local Councilors

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] The "Amendment to the Regulations on the Provincial, Municipal, and County Councils and Provisional Councils, and the Joint Participation of People from All Parties in the Selection of Local Councilors by Selection," proposed by National Government members Xu Chuanlin and Zeng Qi and approved in principle by the State Council, caused a heated debate when it was submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 7th. In the end, it was decided to formulate separate supplementary laws and regulations. The Legal System Committee and the Local Autonomy Law Committee will first study the articles and then submit them for discussion at the regular meeting on the 15th.

During today's discussion of this case, two different opinions were clearly expressed: Liu Tong, Chen Xiyuan, and others agreed in principle to the addition of selected members to the provincial and municipal councils and provisional councils, but believed that it was necessary to carefully consider the method. They pointed out: 1. Some councils have already been elected by the people. Adding selected representatives now is tantamount to going backwards; 2. General elections will be held soon. Adding a selected group of representatives to the local public opinion organs is mutually contradictory in spirit; 3. Councilors represent the people. Who do the selected councilors represent? 4. Although there are regulations that local public opinion organs should be participated in by people from all parties as much as possible in their policy guidelines, this does not mean that they are "naturally" participating; 5. It is unheard of in China and abroad for local councilors to be appointed by the central government. They all believe that the destruction of laws and regulations should not be accommodated to reality.

Legislators Wang Shizeng, Liu Dongyan, and Luo Jingxuan from the Min and Qing parties put forward legal and political reasons, hoping that local public opinion organs can be opened to accommodate people from all parties, and cited the examples of the selection of representatives to the Constitutional National Assembly and the National Political Council.

President Sun Jian instructed: In the past, the Min and Qing parties did not participate in the elections when local councils were established. Now, in order to remedy this, it is stipulated that "for provincial councils that have already been established but have not been re-elected, the National Government may, in addition to the existing number of councilors, select up to three-fifths of the original number of people to be provincial councilors" so that people from both parties can participate together. However, when the council is officially established, both parties can participate in the new election, and the selection problem will not occur, so there is no need to stipulate it in the law. This regulation will only be used once, and it is unavoidable to do so. It will not be an example for the future. Using it twice is undemocratic.

Sun Jiulian, Huang Youchang, and others put forward revised opinions. Sun Jiulian advocated adding a clause, while Huang Youchang advocated formulating separate supplementary laws and regulations. It was resolved to formulate separate supplementary laws and regulations, which would first be submitted to the Legal System Committee and the Local Autonomy Law Committee for study and then submitted to the General Assembly on the 15th for discussion.

### Increasing the Number of Manchu National Assembly Delegates Indicates Ethnic Equality

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] When the Legislative Yuan discussed increasing the number of Manchu National Assembly delegates on the morning of the 7th, President Sun Jian gave a very thorough explanation of nationalism. Mr. Sun first pointed out that the Republic of China is a multi-ethnic country. The Constitution has repeatedly mentioned that all ethnic groups are equal, without distinction. Therefore, we must never have discriminatory ideas again. Although the style of Soviet doctrine is slightly different from ours, its enlightened ethnic policy is the greatest success of its nation-building and is worth emulating. Although the United States is a land of freedom, its discrimination against blacks is the biggest stain. However, in recent years, the United States has passed many laws to protect Indians, and discrimination has also been reduced. The proposers of this case to increase the number of Manchu National Assembly delegates, Yu Youren, Zou Lu, and Zhang Ji, were all anti-Manchu veterans in the past, but what they wanted to overthrow was the autocracy of the Qing Dynasty, not to hate the Manchu people. The submission of this case indicates that they treat all ethnic groups equally. For the sake of the country's future and the future of democracy, we should treat all ethnic groups equally and should not have autocratic ideas. If we are still confused by corrupt and backward ideas, a new country will be difficult to establish. Manchu legislator Guang Lu also repeatedly appealed, hoping that sympathy could be extended to the Manchu people, who number 27 million. A certain country has established a "Manchu Liberation Committee" in Chita, with ulterior motives, and we should pay attention to it. Liu Butong also said that a certain country intends to use Puyi to win over the Manchu people, which cannot be ignored. Dong Qizheng, Liu Keshu, and Zhao Naiyi agreed in principle to increase the number of Manchu representatives, but did not advocate specifically stating the Manchu people in the Constitution, because the Constitution does not specifically state other ethnic groups. It was resolved to amend Article 4 of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law to increase the number of ethnic groups elected in border areas from the original 17 to 34, and to stipulate in the allocation table that 17 members are elected by Manchu nationals, including one female representative.

### Overseas Chinese Remittances from South China Flee to Hong Kong; Last Month's Figure Exceeded 100 Billion

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th Dispatch] Since the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, due to the wide difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate, the amount of overseas Chinese remittances from South China that fled to Hong Kong in October was estimated to exceed 100 billion. Even when remittances arrived in Guangdong, the recipients refused to accept the money because the government compensation rate was too low, requesting that it be returned to the original remittance location and then instructing the remitter to transfer it to Hong Kong for collection. As a result, overseas Chinese remittances in Guangdong are declining daily. If the bureau does not hurry to improve the situation, the foreign exchange absorption plan will become a pipe dream.

### Guangzhou Importers Fraudulently Request Import Quotas; Third-Quarter Quotas Temporarily Not Allocated

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th Dispatch] After the Guangzhou city's import license fraud case, which caused a sensation, was exposed and the main culprits were imprisoned, a new case of large-scale counterfeiting of seals and fraudulent applications for import quotas was discovered. Recently, the South China Wheel Management Branch has received 1,023 applications from importers for the third-quarter import quota. Among them, 251 cases were found to be counterfeit seals and fraudulent applications, and the total number of importers in the city is only 960, but the number of applicants exceeds this by 63, which is shocking. The Wheel Management Branch is currently investigating the matter, and the third-quarter quota has not yet been allocated.

### Yantai Customs Opens; Large Quantities of Food Transported from Tianjin

### Hu Shih Urgently Persuades Students That There Is No Reason to Strike; Students Detained in Beiping Released Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 7th Dispatch] Hu Shih said today regarding the student unrest in Beiping: The students' actions this time are still considered prudent. The students should quickly return to normal. The reasons for the strike that were previously cited no longer exist. Zhejiang University, which was involved in the case, has also resumed classes. Meng Xiangong and Li Gongyi, two students who were arrested at Peking University, have sent handwritten letters to the school authorities to report that they are very safe. The five students who were detained yesterday for some reason have now been released. If they continue to strike, they will lose all social sympathy. I (Hu refers to himself) have made my best efforts for this matter. I will not be able to do anything about things beyond my scope.

[Also from Wire] The five students who were detained yesterday have now been completely released. The "North China Student Federation" organized by students from Peking University and other schools decided tonight: They will not resume classes until the arrested students Meng Xiangong and Li Gongyi and two teachers from Peimang Girls' High School are released. The striking schools include Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yanjing University, Teachers College, and the Sino-French College.

### Zhejiang Provincial Security Authorities Explain the Yu Zisan Case and Clarify the Points of Zhu Kezhen's Talk

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 7th Dispatch] Regarding the points of President Zhu of Zhejiang University's speech in Beijing published in the Shanghai newspapers on the 6th, the Zhejiang security authorities made a special explanation: 1. Regarding the arrest of students without going through the school, it was found that the Yu case was received from intelligence from Beijing and Shanghai, and tracking was arranged. Chen Jianxin and Huang Bomin were found in the Datong Hotel. They were both Communist Party members from Shanghai. It was not until the arrest was made late at night that Yu Zisan and Bo Jin were found to be students of Zhejiang University, carrying various Communist Party books and secret documents. Therefore, they were arrested. They did not know that they were students of Zhejiang University beforehand, and the arrest was also made outside the school, so it seemed that the school could not be notified. 2. Regarding the failure to transfer the case to the court within the statutory time, it was found that the case involved a Communist Party conspiracy, which was related to local security. This case was handled in accordance with Articles 7 and 16 of the Outline for the Implementation of General Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion and Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishment for Obstructing General Mobilization, which is in full compliance with the law. 3. Regarding whether the deceased Yu Zisan was a member of the Communist Party, it was found that Yu Zisan was the person in charge of the Communist Party's New Tide Society in Hangzhou. Secret letters, lists, and other items were copied from his body. His leadership by the Communist Party and the China Democratic League was recorded in his own handwriting. President Zhu had personally read it, which can be used as evidence. 4. Regarding the truth about Yu Zisan's suicide and the joint autopsy, it was found that after Yu committed suicide, the person in charge asked the court to conduct an inspection and notified Zhejiang University to send personnel to inspect. President Zhu, Dean Gu, School Doctor Li, and two student representatives arrived at the same time. After the judge and inspectors examined it, there were no traces of injury. It was indeed suicide by sharp glass. President Zhu personally wrote "I have seen it on the spot" at the request of the prosecutor, and there was no failure to notify. As for the source of the murder weapon, the court found it under the floor of Yu Zisan's house. The court will announce the detailed evidence soon. 5. The two guards were negligent in prevention and have been detained. The legal responsibility for this matter will be dealt with according to law.

### Zhu Kezhen Leaves Beijing for Hangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th Dispatch] President Zhu Kezhen of Zhejiang University left Nanjing on the Qiantang on the morning of the 7th to return to Hangzhou.

### Zhenjiang Shipping Industry Faces Crisis; Forced to Suspend Flights, Reduce Flights, and Merge

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch] According to Xiang Chunting, chairman of the Zhenjiang Shipping Industry Association, there were 218 civilian-owned shipping vessels in Zhenjiang before the war, but now there are only 28. Recently, due to low income, high expenses, and many military demands, there are many dangers. It is difficult to predict whether the water transportation between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River can continue to be maintained in the future. It was found that the Zhenjiang shipping industry had called for coal several times in October, and only 120 tons of coal were allocated, while the actual demand of various companies in Zhenjiang was 2,078 tons. The coal shortage had to be purchased on the black market, which cost about 3.2 million yuan per ton. Therefore, many shipping companies were forced to suspend flights, reduce flights, or merge and jointly operate in order to cope with the military and civilian transportation between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. The situation is very dangerous.

### Molotov Explains Foreign Policy: Willing to Seek International Cooperation, Accuses the United States of Attempting to Encircle the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Moscow, 6th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, speaking at a special meeting here today commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, stated that the secret of the atomic bomb is no longer the exclusive domain of the United States. He also called on anti-imperialist forces to unite into a powerful force that capitalism cannot match, in order to defeat the capitalist aggression plan.

Molotov stated, when mentioning foreign policy: All true friends of peace, which are the majority of people in any country, can be sure that the Soviet Union will always maintain the interests of world peace. The Soviet Union has always advocated the widespread development of international cooperation. Comrade Stalin indicated during his meeting with the famous American politician Mr. Stettinius that the United States and the Soviet Union could naturally cooperate with each other. If the United States and the Soviet Union can cooperate, then any differences of opinion will not be an obstacle. The economic systems of the United States and the Soviet Union are indeed different, but since they were able to cooperate during wartime, why can't they do so in peacetime? If there is no sincerity for cooperation, then even if the economic systems are similar, countries and peoples will still inevitably fight each other. There have been many rumors recently in the Soviet Union about the various plans of the United States, such as the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. People who hear that the United States has so many plans to aid Europe and China, etc., will certainly think that its domestic problems must have already been resolved, so it only needs to sort out the affairs of other countries, force others to accept its policies, and even organize governments on behalf of others. But in fact, this is not entirely the case. The United States, often in collusion with Britain, is seizing new naval and air force bases all over the world, and is even pursuing similar goals against entire countries, especially those close to the Soviet Union. How can such pressure from American imperialists not be denounced by anyone? The British-American Joint Chiefs of Staff established during the war is still maintained in Washington, which is definitely not for the purpose of peace, but to coerce other countries with an aggressive posture.

The ruling classes of Britain and the United States are now leading a "faction" that attempts to consolidate capitalism and complete the domination of others. The Soviet Union's policy is based on the opposite principle, which is to respect the sovereignty of all countries, large and small, and not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

### The Soviet Union Cannot Tolerate British and American Enslavement of Europe

Molotov then spoke about the German problem, saying that if Britain and the United States had been able to implement all democratic principles after the war, and the principles on the German problem in the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, then the cooperation between the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain would have been able to produce good results today. Unfortunately, Britain and the United States did not do this, and have unilaterally made the Anglo-American zone a jointly governed area. And there is no longer a German state. Britain and the United States also rely on German capitalists who previously supported Hitler, using their Ruhr industrial base to threaten countries that do not want to be enslaved, in order to achieve their goal of dominating Europe. But such adventurers' plans will certainly be opposed by the democratic countries of Europe. Judging from the German problem, we can see that the principles taken by Britain and the United States today are imperialist principles, which are completely divorced from the democratic principles on which the Soviet Union is based. In the current situation, it is necessary for the entire anti-imperialist and democratic forces in Europe and beyond to unite to resist the economic enslavement policies of the imperialists.

Our Officials Believe This Is a Diplomatic War of Nerves

[United Press, Nanjing, 7th] Officials here believe that the speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is merely another war of nerves between the United States and the Soviet Union. According to the United Press's summary of the reactions of officials here, they generally suspect that Molotov's atomic bomb speech is a sign that Soviet foreign policy will have new developments. It is said that "most of the secrets" of the atomic bomb have become common knowledge. They pointed out that the Soviet Union has repeatedly hinted that atomic bomb knowledge is not exclusive to the United States, but the problem lies in continuous research and complex production technology, and not in discovering its secrets. Regarding Molotov's accusation that the United States is encircling the Soviet Union with military bases with the aim of invading the Soviet Union, officials here said that when Germany under Hitler created Germany as a country for war, it often expressed the same arguments. This is a consistent old trick used by some countries to fight other countries by using this point.

The US Expresses Skepticism About the Soviets Possessing Secrets

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] Experts in the US government with very high positions, while not expressing skepticism or disbelief regarding Molotov's claim that the atomic bomb has no secrets, pointed out that there is a great distance between learning the secrets of the atomic bomb and manufacturing it, including the consumption of huge amounts of money, manpower, and materials. US officials have no comment on Molotov's remarks. Representatives to the United Nations are very interested in Molotov's remarks, but also express skepticism. One European representative familiar with the Soviet Union said that Molotov's remarks are not surprising at all. Everyone knows that Soviet scientists' atomic decomposition studies are not inferior to anyone else's, but the whole question is whether the Soviet Union has the industrial capacity and manufacturing methods to produce a significant number of atomic bombs.

The Forefront of the Offensive on the Eve of the Foreign Ministers' Conference

[Reuters, London, 6th] Molotov's speech, in terms of its main points, is merely a restatement of the doctrine published by Soviet Communist Party Secretary Zhdanov at the time of the establishment of the Communist Information Bureau. The Soviet Union's theory that a postwar American economic crisis cannot be avoided is not new, but Molotov specifically reiterated the Soviet Union's new doctrine, namely that the American economic crisis is imminent, and that American imperialism is a direct result of domestic difficulties in the United States. Political observers are studying Molotov's speech in detail in order to glean from it the policy that the Soviet Union will adopt at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. Molotov said, "The principles of Britain and the United States on the German question are based on imperialism, while the Soviet Union is based on democracy." It can be seen that at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, Molotov will fully attack the development of the Anglo-American merger zone, denouncing it as an attempt to split the country and establish an anti-communist outpost.

### Douglas Returns Home Today

[Report from this newspaper] London, 7th, broadcast: US Ambassador to Britain Douglas will return to Washington tomorrow to hold meetings with government officials.

### Regarding the US President's Emergency Aid Plan for Europe, Congress Is Willing to Take Swift Action and Plans to Request Marshall to Attend and Explain

[US Information Service, Washington, 6th] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative Herter, Vice Chairman of the House Foreign Aid Committee, stated today that Congress will take swift action on the interim relief plan for Europe.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The House Foreign Aid Committee decided today to propose a recommendation that the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation provide temporary assistance to France and Italy when necessary, until March 31 of next year.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] The Republican-controlled Congress is now preparing to make things difficult for the government on the issue of aid to Europe, on the one hand demanding the release of all the facts, and on the other hand accusing the Truman administration of incompetence in handling foreign aid. When the Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives meet next Monday to review the interim aid plan for Europe, they will also request Secretary of State Marshall to attend and explain. Judging from the current situation, although Truman stated when he convened Congress for a special session on the 17th of this month that the interim aid plan for Europe should be discussed as a priority, its passage will inevitably be protracted. According to House Speaker Martin, the Republican Party cannot simply be a rubber stamp for the government's plans.

A press release issued by the conference announced other procedural resolutions established in today's meeting, including: (1) The chairmanship will be rotated by the delegations of the four countries every four meetings, in the order of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France; (2) Reporters are not allowed to enter the venue; (3) Any representative may, in principle, raise any issue, whether or not it has already been discussed, but the issue can only be submitted for discussion with the consent of the other three representatives.

Also, Friday is the Soviet Union's National Day, and at Smirnov's proposal, the meeting will be suspended for one day.

### Political Turmoil in Japan: Suehiro Nishio Accused, Cabinet Discusses the Rimpinguma Incident

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] The struggle between the Nishio and Hirano factions within the Japanese Socialist Party is intensifying. Yesterday, another Socialist Party member, Heihachiro Uekusa, filed a complaint with the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office against State Minister Suehiro Nishio, arguing that Nishio gave a speech advocating the National Mobilization Law in the Japanese Diet in 1938 (Showa 13) and should be dismissed in accordance with the Purge Directive.

### Under the Pretext of Preventing Communist Disturbances, Japan Is Plotting to Rebuild Its Army: Behind-the-Scenes Activities Are Actively Underway

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th] According to qualified sources who told Associated Press reporters today, Japan wants to rebuild its army to ensure national security after the Allied forces withdraw. This movement is continuing behind the scenes.

The current new Japanese constitution naturally prohibits the organization of any army, but when the peace treaty is concluded, this issue will become more important. Which faction in the country can finally gain political power will be decided at that time. All parties expect that the situation will become more tense after the occupying forces withdraw, or that riots will occur by the Communist Party, labor leaders, and a gang of thugs. At the same time, all parties also believe that Japan is vulnerable to the invasion of Soviet forces on the Asian continent. MacArthur has made it clear that he is willing to allow Japan to strengthen its police force, but has also expressed his opposition to Japan building an army. It is said that Japan's defense against foreign attacks must be guaranteed by the Allied countries and can be guaranteed by the US Pacific base's air force. The movement to restore the army began during the Yoshida cabinet due to fear of the Soviet Union and the belief that the police force was insufficient to stop the Communist Party or labor leaders within the country, and it has been growing secretly. Later, the outbreak of the general strike was only avoided with MacArthur's direct intervention, and those who supported this proposal became more numerous as a result. However, it is not known whether a formal request has been submitted to the Allied Headquarters.

### Theaters Cannot Maintain Operations if Entertainment Tax is Increased

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Winter Relief Committee plans to increase the entertainment tax on entertainment businesses by 20% in order to raise funds for winter relief. This matter has aroused opposition from the film and theater industry. Foreign film distributors strongly oppose the government's move and stated that they will stop supplying films if it is decided to implement it. The theater industry has not yet received official notification, so there is no statement at present, but according to the person in charge: If the winter relief tax is increased by 20%, it will be impossible to maintain operations in reality. For example, based on the ticket price of 15,000 yuan for first-run cinemas, after deducting various taxes, the actual profit for the theater is only 3,400 yuan. If the government decides to increase the tax from the 16th of this month, the theater industry will convene a meeting of the industry to discuss countermeasures, and the result will be either theater closure or increased ticket prices.

However, the accusers expressed disagreement with this, stating five reasons, believing that the prosecutor failed to mention the shortage of 26,000 cast iron bars (i.e., water pipes) in the indictment, which seemed to be an omission. They expressed disagreement with the dismissal of the charges against Ding Guitang, Guo Yourong, Liu Gongyun, Chen Shouzhi, Wu Rencang, Lu Shishang, and Xie Meng, and filed a petition with the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday requesting continued investigation.

### Thousands of Colors and Varieties: Chrysanthemum Exhibition Opens Today, Leaders Praise Continuously After Yesterday's Preview

[Our Newspaper Special] Our national character respects integrity and resilience, enduring hardship with a leisurely spirit. Chrysanthemums, blooming defiantly amidst the decline of other flowers, symbolize this national spirit and are admired by Chinese people. The Public Works Bureau's Gardens Administration, in this crisp autumn season, has gathered over 30,000 pots of famous chrysanthemums, holding a chrysanthemum exhibition at Fuxing Park. The dazzling array of colors and rare varieties inspire awe at the remarkable skills of the chrysanthemum growers. This chrysanthemum exhibition is divided into display and competition areas. The chrysanthemum competition area includes: Cascade chrysanthemums, small chrysanthemums with long branches, trained artificially into various cascading shapes, are very artistic. Potted chrysanthemums, with three or four flowers on each plant, come in a variety of names, including "Drunk Spring," "Phoenix Facing the Sun," "Morning Glow," "Hibiscus Spring Color," and "Emerging Lotus." Single-stem chrysanthemums, with only one stem and one flower on top, are very rare. Upright chrysanthemums, the entire plant is particularly tall and the number of flowers is also large. The Hengyuan variety is the best, and the Fourth Nursery has the most flowers, with 127 flowers.

Black Chrysanthemums and Green Lotus are the Most Difficult to Grow A pot of precious chrysanthemums must have a balanced plant, harmonious and bright colors, a novel and rare variety, lush stems and flowers, and no shedding of lower leaves, which is not easy to cultivate. Among the most precious chrysanthemums in this exhibition, it is said that the black chrysanthemum and the green lotus are the most precious. The black chrysanthemum is purplish-black, and the green lotus is light green. Due to the rarity of the varieties, they are also the most difficult to grow.

In addition, the Gardens Administration arranged various chrysanthemums such as Yellow Shushuang, White Lotus, Xueqing, and Xuexie into chrysanthemum pavilions, chrysanthemum screens, chrysanthemum bridges, chrysanthemum mountains, chrysanthemum towers, and double dragon snatching pearls, creating a fascinating scene of thousands of colors.

At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, the Gardens Administration first invited guests from all walks of life to a preview. Mayor Wu, Mrs. Zhao Zukang, Ambassador Situ Dangdeng, and the Canadian Commercial Counselor arrived on time, and everyone praised continuously.

Simple and Noble, Beneficial to Social Customs The success of this year's chrysanthemum exhibition must be attributed to Xu Tianxi, director of the Gardens Administration, horticultural expert Cheng Shifu, and his daughter Miss Chu, who have worked hard silently. They said: "Nowadays, social customs are declining, and citizens' entertainment is becoming increasingly low-level. We take this opportunity to cultivate a simple and noble interest. If we can change customs and improve social education, that is what we hope for."

Today, the chrysanthemum exhibition opens and is scheduled to close on the 16th. However, the weather has been particularly warm recently, and although the flowers are blooming prosperously, we are afraid that they will wither quickly. We hope that the people of Shanghai, living in dust, will not miss this once-a-year chrysanthemum festival!

### Xin Zhuang Three Bao Residents Petition, Requesting to be Incorporated into Shanghai Urban Area, Dispersed After Persuasion on Hu-Min Road

[Our Newspaper] Residents of the Xinzhuang District requested that the district be incorporated into the jurisdiction of Shanghai. After several meetings between representatives of Jiangsu Province and Shanghai Municipality, a draft plan has been decided. The area east of Zhugang in Xinzhuang District will be incorporated into the urban area, and Twelve Bao, Fourteen Bao, and Twenty-six Bao, namely Changqiao, Zhuxing Town, and Wengbanqiao areas, will be incorporated into the jurisdiction of Shanghai County. After hearing the news, the residents of the district were indignant. The three Bao chiefs, Pan Xiaobei, Zhu Guangyao, and Wang Baoyan, together with Li Yusheng, the district chief of Twenty-six Bao, led district representatives Zhu Zhongfang and three or four thousand men and women, each holding a small flag, and planned to petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, the Land Administration Bureau, and the Civil Affairs Bureau at approximately 8:00 a.m. yesterday. When they arrived near the No. 2 Bridge on the Hu-Yue Highway, Xu Linhai, the chief of the Longhua Police Sub-bureau, learned of this. After reporting to Inspector Zhang of the General Bureau, he immediately ordered Jia Weijun, the captain of the mobile army, to lead the mobile team and the police officers of the Second Bao Police Sub-team to rush to the scene. At the same time, Chief Xu, together with Liu Jing, the chief of the first section, and Guo Zhikai, a member of the section, led a large number of police officers to arrive first, maintaining order and persuading them earnestly. After hearing the news, Mayor Wu immediately sent Zhang Xiaosong, the director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, to persuade them.

Li Yusheng, the district chief of Longhua, Zhang Shou, chairman of the district residents' representatives, Zhang Xuelian, a member of the Municipal Council, and others also gave speeches in succession.

Zhu said at the time that he did not have such a large sum of money. The prosecutor immediately said that if there was no bail, he would be taken into custody. Last night, bailiffs took Zhu out to find bail. At around 12:00 p.m., a reporter inquired about the District Prosecutor's Office and was told that the bailiffs had not yet returned.

### Qiao Wanxuan and Yan LunKui Indicted According to the Traitor Ordinance

[Our Newspaper] Qiao Wanxuan, the former chief prosecutor of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, willingly turned traitor when the enemy invaded Shanghai.

### Copyright Dispute Over English-Chinese Four-Use Dictionary: Deputy Manager of Xin Sheng Bookstore, etc., Summoned for Questioning, Deny Plagiarism

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, Jing Wen Bookstore accused Xin Sheng Bookstore of printing and publishing an English-Chinese New Character Four-Use Dictionary by reprinting Jing Wen's published English New Character Dictionary, infringing on copyright. The case is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. On the 22nd of last month, Wu Tiesheng filed a complaint with the Jiangning Road Police Station, stating: "In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], Wu, along with Gui Shaoxu, Ge Chuanran, and Wu Mengxiong, jointly compiled the English New Character Dictionary, which was typeset and printed by Mei Ling Deng Company in Hong Kong, totaling 10,000 copies. It was distributed by Jing Wen Bookstore at 796 Beijing Road and registered with the Ministry of Interior, obtaining a copyright registration certificate. On October 10th of this year, it was suddenly discovered in the Ta Kung Pao that Xin Sheng Bookstore was publishing an English-Chinese New Character Four-Use Dictionary. Upon investigation, the content of the manuscript of that book was found to be nine-tenths identical to the English New Character Dictionary written by Wu and others."

After the police station dispatched officers to the Zhongwai Printing Factory at No. 30, Lane 727, Huai'an Road, the person in charge of printing the Four-Use Dictionary, Zhang Lianfang, was summoned to the station for questioning. Zhang stated, "The dictionary was entrusted to be typeset and printed by Yu Weiqing, the manager of Xin Sheng Bookstore, with a quantity of 10,000 copies. It will take another 20 days to complete printing. When the manuscript was delivered, half of it consisted of pieces of paper torn from a book, and these pieces of paper were approximately the same as the English New Character Dictionary." The police station repeatedly summoned Yu Weiqing, the manager of Xin Sheng Bookstore, without success. Therefore, Yu Shaoqing (Yu Weiqing's younger brother), the deputy manager of the bookstore, and Lu Yaping, the sales director, were summoned for the case. They vehemently denied the reprinting and claimed that there was no such thing as tearing pages from a book as a manuscript, but they were unable to produce the manuscript as proof. The police station, suspecting them of plagiarism and reprinting, ordered Yu and Lu to post bail and transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the Copyright Law. Yesterday, the prosecutor summoned the plaintiff Wu Tiesheng, the defendants Gan Shaoqing and Lu Yaping, and the witness Zhang Lianfang for questioning. The defendants claimed that the dictionary was compiled and translated by Guan Xuewen and Xia Sungui and denied plagiarism. The prosecutor stated that a detailed comparison of the two dictionaries was needed before a decision could be made, and all were ordered to return home for now.

### Russian Woman Who Twice Divorced Her Husband, Confined in a Mental Hospital, Former Husband Agrees in Court to Pay 40 Million Yuan in Compensation

Criminal Part XIV Pronouncement

[Our Newspaper's Report] A 25-year-old Russian woman, Fannaditina, married Ai Sisin Keweiqi. After their marriage, they lived together at No. 6, Lane 1275, Central Linsen Road. Their relationship was generally good. On November 8th, 1946, Fan was arrested by the police for drug use and sent to a hospital for detoxification. Ai divorced Fan at this time. In mid-December, Ai went to the hospital to visit Fan and saw that Fan's addiction had been eliminated and her health had recovered. The two reconciled and on December 19th

remarried. However, a separation had already grown between the two, and they could not thoroughly understand each other. Finally, on February 17th of this year, they divorced for the second time. At approximately 3:00 PM on April 12th, Fan was strolling with her boyfriend at the intersection of Central Linsen Road and Sinan Road when Ai drove by. Seeing Fan, Ai stopped the car, pulled Fan into the car, and drove away quickly. Fan was confused. The car went to the Changshu Road Police Station, where Ai took Fan inside and reported to the police authorities that Fan was suffering from a mental illness and requested that she be sent to a mental hospital. The police station, accompanied by Ai, transported Fan to Minhang Puci Hospital for examination. Unexpectedly, Ai colluded with two doctors at the hospital, Peng Erna and Huang Yingbang, to certify that Fan had a mental illness and needed to remain in the hospital for

long-term treatment. Fan was subsequently confined in the hospital. A friend, Luo Mainuofu, went to Puci Hospital to visit his wife and met Fan, learning the details. Luo consulted with friends outside and hired lawyer Zhu Gaorong and Dr. Ren Huijia, a specialist from the Fourth Municipal Hospital, to examine Fan. They proved that Fan was mentally and physically normal and had no mental illness. They then negotiated with Peng and Huang, and on May 22nd, Fan was allowed to leave the hospital. Afterward, Fan filed a private prosecution with the District Court, accusing Ai, Da, and Huang of

restricting her freedom and including a civil suit, demanding compensation of 40 million yuan for damages. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Judge Shao Renjie presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court. First, the plaintiff Fannaditina stated the facts of the case. Then, the first defendant Ai Sisin Keweiqi, the second defendant Daerbang, and the third defendant Huang Yingbang were questioned in succession. At this point, the court discussed a settlement, but Fan refused, stating that Ai had

imprisoned her without cause for more than 40 days and did not provide her with food in the hospital, so she had to sue him. The court then asked the first defendant Ai Sisin Keweiqi if he was willing to pay 40 million yuan. Ai readily agreed, immediately signing a settlement record, providing 40 million yuan, but stating that it was a "gift" to Fan. Fan refused again, requesting that it be changed to "payment." Ai reluctantly agreed. The compensation portion was resolved in court, and the criminal portion was scheduled for pronouncement on the 14th of this month.

### Wang Huayi, the Main Culprit in the Trunk Corpse Case Twelve Years Ago, is Like a Trapped Beast Caught in a Tiger Trap

[Our Newspaper's Beiping Airmail Dispatch on the 5th] Twelve years ago (1936), in the last days of January, it was the time when the Spring Festival had just passed, and all the people were celebrating. The baggage section of Beiping's Qianmen Railway Station received two painted iron trunks, one blue and one purple. When weighed, they were found to be very heavy. The staff thought they were some kind of goods and requested to open them for inspection. The passenger who delivered them did not have the key and said he would go home to get it, but he never returned. These two heavy painted iron trunks, destined for Shenyang, were abandoned by their owner like discarded shoes, and no one ever came to inquire about them. The station staff became suspicious and opened the trunks. What luggage was inside? Hey! It turned out to be two piles of dismembered, bloody, and blurred male corpses. The heads, arms, and thighs had been cut off and covered with old cotton quilts.

This horrific trunk corpse case shocked North China and even the entire country at that time and kept the Beiping security authorities busy. Finally, the accomplice Li Liangjing, but not the main culprit, was arrested. It was learned that the deceased, Zhang Shulin, was having an affair with Wang Huayi's nanny, Liu Wangshi (commonly known as Liu Ma), at the same time as his master, who was also

his love rival. Wang Huayi was consumed by jealousy and later invited his brother-in-law, Xi Cangyou, and bribed the cook Li Liangjing to kill Zhang Shulin on the night of January 27, 1936. Four days later, they prepared to transport the body to Panyang to dispose of it and destroy the evidence. After the case was discovered, the accomplice Li Liangjing was arrested and sentenced to death, but Wang Huayi, the main culprit who instigated the crime, and another accomplice, Xi Cangyou, disappeared without a trace. People in Beiping and Tianjin, in the turbulent and difficult years of the past twelve years, had long forgotten this personal grievance.

On October 18th of this year, at No. 40, Lane 7, Dongsi, the detective team arrested a drug offender named Wang Zongyao. Wang confessed to drug use in the detective team. After being sent to the police station, Wang recanted his confession, and the police station could not proceed. He was returned to the detective team for further investigation. At this time, Wang's nephew Zhou was working hard to help him, and in some combination of circumstances, he inadvertently revealed that Wang Zongyao was Wang Huayi. Coincidentally, a reporter was nearby, and the next day, the news was published in the newspaper with a large headline. On the other hand, the Detective Team No. 8, which was re-investigating the case, was the same detective team that handled the trunk corpse case twelve years ago. So, they found the original file and interrogated him strictly, finally unearthing this

man who had changed his name and hidden himself

and had traveled far and wide, a "living dead man".

After a veteran team member who had worked in the detective team for fifteen years recognized him as the main culprit in the trunk corpse case twelve years ago, and after Liu Liushi, who was familiar with Wang, identified Wang Zongyao as Wang Huayi, Wang Zongyao could no longer deny his original name, Wang Huayi. He is now sixty-two years old, with a burly body, pale complexion, fierce eyes, and a full beard. In the detective team, wearing a blue coat, yellow leather shoes, and velvet trousers, he looked extremely embarrassed, like a trapped beast in a tiger trap.

Twelve years is a long time. People and things have changed, becoming unpredictable. Wang Huayi, who had originally run away and traveled far and wide, has returned to the original place after twelve years

wearing shackles.

However, Li Liangjing, the accomplice who was arrested after the incident, has regained his freedom after ten years behind bars. According to lawyer Gao, ten years in prison have greatly changed Li Liangjing. Li was not very literate before, but after fighting a lawsuit for ten years, Li's writing has become clear and readable, and his handwriting is also good. However, his strength has become much weaker. Because of the murder case, it is not easy for him to find a job. Although he has the skills of a cook, he had to change careers. It is said that Li has returned to his native Suining. He has not been seen for the past year.

### Analysis by the Economic Research Department of the National Bank: Deposit Currency Circulation Speed, The Relationship Between Floating Capital Moving South and Overseas Remittances is Not Very Close

[Our Report] Regarding the recent trend of currency circulation speed and capital moving south, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank yesterday, who provided a detailed analysis as follows:

The currency circulation speed of Shanghai commercial bank deposits, calculated starting from this year, has now been calculated up to June. The circulation speed for each month is as follows: January: 19.77, February: 24.63, March: 21.32, April: 22.57, May: 33.96, June: 38.05. The calculation for July is in progress and is expected to be even higher than June. This circulation speed is the circulation speed of deposit currency (current deposits), not the circulation speed of legal tender (banknotes). It is often mistakenly referred to as the circulation speed of legal tender, which is not factual. In reality, although we cannot calculate the circulation speed of banknotes, it is undoubtedly much lower than the circulation speed of deposit currency (also known as credit). Furthermore, this circulation speed of deposit currency only includes the deposit currency of commercial banks and does not include the deposit currency of state banks. Since state banks do not allow the use of negotiable instruments, the circulation speed of deposit currency in state banks is much lower than that in commercial banks. Moreover, this department has not yet started this work in other cities, but it can be asserted that the circulation speed of deposit currency in other cities is lower than in this city. This is not only because this city is the largest speculative market in the country, but also because other cities rarely have a negotiable instrument system.

The movement of domestic floating capital is mainly due to speculation and smuggling. Recently, the relationship between the southward movement of floating capital and overseas remittances has not been very close. Generally speaking, floating capital is still concentrated in Shanghai because Shanghai is the place for speculation and hoarding. As for the recent flow of floating capital to South China, it is related to the "all-access permit."

### Representatives of Private Yarn Factories Report on Petitioning Process

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association held a temporary board meeting yesterday, where Liu Piji and Rong Erren, who had just returned from petitioning in Nanjing, reported on the petitioning process. They stated that private yarn factories in the city only have free sales of cotton yarn accounting for slightly less than 30% of the total output. Most businesses are based on custom spinning. In fact, yarn production has already been allocated by the government, and there is no real need for certificate-based allocation. Moreover, it is very difficult to allocate the production volume of Shanghai alone to the entire country. It is said that government authorities are very sympathetic to the opinions of private yarn factories, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will formulate a new allocation plan. At the same time, it was learned that Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will come to Shanghai today, and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association will send representatives to present their opinions to Minister Chen again.

### Chinese Stocks Struggle Between Bulls and Bears; Slight Decline at Closing

Yesterday, Chinese stocks saw various parties such as the yarn flower gang adding positions. Gold firms and Guangdong merchants still had healthy buying appetite. Large securities firms covered short positions. National banks showed a large excess. Off-market stimulus reappeared, leading to many gains. However, new shorts also resisted, and there was considerable struggle after the high. At closing, the market gradually became uncertain.

At the morning opening, stocks that opened earlier saw highs, while those that opened later were lower, due to the lower exchange rate for British currency, while the US exchange rate did not change. After opening, Yong An Cotton Mill rose from 284 yuan and 291 yuan, but then fell to 279 yuan for immediate delivery and 287 yuan for forward delivery. There was gradual absorption, and the off-market interest rate opened lower at 13.5 cents and 18 cents. Foreign stocks looked good, and off-market bidding prices rose to 291 yuan and 299 yuan for immediate delivery. At this time, Meyer also started to rise. Yong An Cotton Mill rose again to 294 yuan and 303 yuan. Near closing, it rose to a high price of 296 yuan for immediate delivery and 304 yuan for forward delivery. The noon closing was 294 yuan for immediate delivery and 302 yuan for forward delivery. Other stocks, except for the Five Harmonies which saw sluggish transactions and a sharp drop, and the still tired underwear stocks, mostly ended at high levels.

The market was stable in the afternoon. Although Guangdong merchants entered, they were eager to sell at high prices, and the market was momentarily unsustainable. Yong An Cotton Mill fell to a low price of 293 yuan for immediate delivery and 298 yuan for forward delivery. At this time, there was no shortage of buyers for both spot and forward delivery. National banks once again had an exchange surplus of over 100 billion. China Silk hit the upper limit, rising to 303 yuan for immediate delivery and 308 yuan for forward delivery. China Cement also hit the upper limit, and sentiment was very high, rising to a high price of 310 yuan for immediate delivery and 315 yuan for forward delivery. Wan Tai Trading House had a closing account, and sentiment became weak. Near closing, the market became increasingly uncertain. Yong An Cotton Mill closed at 304 yuan and 307 yuan. Off-market, all old stocks trended upward uniformly, especially cultural stocks, public utility stocks, bank stocks, and Da Sheng.

### National Bonds Slightly Recover; Foreign Stocks Surge

Room 360 also sold after buying in. As a result, compared to the previous closing, A and B rose by 500 yuan, Bing rose by 200 yuan, Ding rose by 800 yuan, and E rose by 100 yuan.

Foreign stocks were stimulated by various factors yesterday and saw a surge. Jardine Matheson opened at 198,000 yuan and rose to a new high price of 210,000 yuan. Foreign firms and Guangdong merchants supplied, while money changers and securities firms bought in. The rise in paper stocks was even more intense, and the process was very tense. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Jardine Matheson, British-American Tobacco, Shanghai Steel, Telephone, and Tramways each rose by 50%, while John D. Hutchison and Navigation & Construction rose by 10%. Paper stocks alone rose by 20%, and the rest all rose.

### Domestic Tea Sales Are Booming

Yesterday, domestic sales of black and green tea continued to be like fish in water, especially ordinary black tea and Ping Shui flag tea, which were even more favored by buyers. Opening prices were uniformly excellent. As for the foreign firm tea market, the English merchant export firm continued to suppress the price of this year's Keemun black tea, and because sellers were unwilling to sell easily, transactions remained unclear and the situation remained firm and quiet. As for other green tea varieties, the French firm Yongxing continued to be interested in Anhui and Tunxi merchants, but due to the scarcity of goods and supply shortages, the process was not lively.

Commercial Briefs

The National Goods Factory Association held a board meeting yesterday and resolved to telegraph the central government again, petitioning to consider the actual difficulties of the business community and allow the use of current bills for turnover.

The November issuance of 36-year short-term treasury bonds, as of the 6th, has sold a total of US$1,040,390, equivalent to 54,764,850,000 yuan in legal tender.

### Reader Consults on Legal Doubts: Weak Woman Under the Shackles of Old Morality Seeks to Break Free and Pursue Light

Dear Editor: I am a woman shackled by old morality. I am already twenty years old this year. When I was six years old, my grandmother decided on my marriage to a man surnamed Guo. At that time, because I was young and ignorant, I naturally did not object. For thirteen years, I have had no feelings for Mr. Guo at all, and even his appearance is vague to me. Furthermore, he enlisted in the army in the winter of the 33rd year and has been away since. In these three long years, he has sent no news to me. From this, it seems that I have disappeared from his heart.

Last spring, I studied at a certain school and met a classmate named Li. Under enthusiastic encouragement, our feelings grew with each passing day. For more than a year, we have plunged into the white-hot sea of love. So I asked my father to cancel the engagement with the Guo family, but my father flatly refused in a feudal tone. In this environment blocked by old morality, I have become a fragile lamb, not knowing what method to use to resolve this difficult problem. I have long heard that your newspaper is a guide for lost souls. I respectfully ask you to shed light on the following questions, for which I will be extremely grateful. Is the marriage contract made by my grandmother without reaching the legal age valid? Can I individually publish a statement in the newspaper denying this marriage contract? If I propose to cancel the engagement, can the other party demand compensation for losses? If the other party does not agree, what should be done? If I have not dissolved this marriage contract, can I get engaged to Mr. Li? Are there any other issues regarding legal preferential treatment for Mr. Guo as an active-duty soldier? If my parents do not agree, what legal methods can I use to deal with this? From reader He Fen.

[Lawyer Chuan Kuang Replies] If the person has reached adulthood, they can claim that the marriage contract made by their parents in the past is invalid. Yes. If the other party is not at fault, they can demand compensation for damages suffered as a result. If the other party does not agree, it can be ignored. Yes. No. Cannot be forced to perform.

### The Rage of the German Writer Fritz Von Unruh

— Zhao Jingshen

Fritz Von Unruh is a famous German playwright and lyric poet. When the Nazis came to power, he, like Thomas Mann and other modern German writers, fled abroad. During the war, he was in France and lost everything, including his manuscripts. He was imprisoned in a French concentration camp. It was Einstein and Thomas Mann who asked President Roosevelt to rescue him. He arrived in the United States in 1941. In the United States, he relied on his own memories and the imagination of "angry anti-Teutons" to create a "panorama of the apocalyptic era." At the end of his strange and huge long novel, he only added a simple note. He said: "I wrote the dance of death of this era in dramatic prose. By doing so, I was isolated in the darkest and most secluded places, making it easy for me to analyze the microbes that Nazism infected me with. I not only showed it to others but also pointed out the possibility of eradication—that is the consciousness of this work." This work is called "The End Is Not Yet." Before its publication, many translators were eager to translate it, and many publishers saw the original manuscript. To quote the author, everyone "was amazed by this dramatically moving epic."

Thomas Mann believed that Unruh was the most talented German playwright of the past decade or so, and Unruh's lyrical poems are also the best in modern German literature. Obviously, such a profoundly creative writer (his recent works are all symbolic) can produce very moving novels describing the Nazi devastation of culture. Furthermore, his poetic and dramatic genius are products of his strong personality and powerful self-confidence. His ancestors were wealthy Prussian landowners, and his father was the governor of East Prussia and a friend of Hindenburg. Such a person, after enduring the humiliation of ten years of exile and escape, after his books were burned by the Nazis and he was deprived of his citizenship, could not write his epic prose novel. His heart was burned by rage against the huge group that brought his country to ruin and caused the Second World War. He could only turn his anger into dramatic symbolism, and his sad memories into cohesive narratives. The result is this book. The terror and corruption created by the madmen written in it are almost unimaginable.

One scene takes place in the German Embassy in Paris. Hitler, Goebbels, Hess, and many officers are present. A Polish Jewish dancer, Nadia, is thrown into a cage with a large ape. "The African great ape wrapped its huge arms around Nadia's hips. Her screams disappeared in laughter and shouts. Saliva dripped down Hess's chin. He shouted: 'Like the law of the Pharaohs against the Jews, it is necessary to prevent inferior races from mixing with the noble Egyptian race, thus degrading it. Drive the Hebrews out of the Nile.' Hitler ran to the side of the cage, 'That's right. I want to sterilize all of you people in the world! You rising sow,' Nadia's hands trembled weakly, 'Oh God, oh God! Are you going to drown them? Dear, dear God, drown them. Drown them in a red sea of blood, a sea of blood, these murderers!'" This imaginary sentence is very simple.

On the same night, in another scene, the murderous demon Buch tortures a Polish Catholic dancer to death. Hitler, out of insane selfishness, wants to bring the dead girl back to life. When the naked corpse of the girl is placed in front of Hitler's feet, he says to the officer Keitel: "Keitel, listen to me. My flesh has been crawling all the way to my fingertips! My blood feels a stinging sensation, as if ants are walking into my veins! What? It would be a joke if a superman like me, Hitler, would be like this in front of such a weak female corpse!" He clenched his fist and struck the spiritual keys, and the strings made a clanging sound. "Keitel! You are a noble warrior, and I solemnly ask you, do you believe that I can bring this dead dancer back to life?" Initially, the dancer was invited to dance, Hitler was with her, stripped her clothes, and forced her to dance on the large glass floor of his study. The result naturally reached the climax of madness and depravity. The madness of Hitler and his subordinates is not only expressed once in the whole book. Hitler's boasting and madness almost made readers not believe that his power had expanded to Germany and most of Europe. The animal that Unruh portrayed seems to be entirely imaginary, and the people around him also seem to be from a mental asylum.

Part of what Unruh wrote is factual. We may as well regard this book as a fable. The characters in it are all symbols, not men and women of flesh and blood. But symbolism and allegory fully capture the madness and inhumanity of the Nazis.

### Small Note on Being Pickpocketed

— ·Qu Yi Xiao Li·

After receiving a small amount of manuscript fees, I went out with my wife to buy some fabric to prepare winter clothes for the children. I am ashamed to say that although the country has won, we, who have experienced great disasters, are still wearing ragged clothes like we did ten years ago when we returned to Shanghai.

We went to a large company on Nanjing Road and bought two pieces of clothing material and two sets of what we considered cheap and good children's clothing. After repeated planning, we bought a Jishi brand electric clock and dragged our tired steps and satisfied hearts out of the Xinxin Company.

The sun was now shining slantingly on the road. The good time of the whole half-day had passed quickly like this. I began to feel a little hungry, so I suggested going to Dasanyuan for refreshments.

My wife and I talked about what we bought and studied the colors of the clothing material. I was most happy that we had bought an electric clock. From now on, when I rest from writing at night, I will no longer have to wait for the neighbor's clock to tell me the time. My wife was also happy for me, so I took out a pen from my inner pocket and drew on the back of the tea menu the place where I planned to hang the electric clock.

In this way, we finished our refreshments very satisfactorily. Because we were too excited, I carelessly stuck my pen in the small pocket outside my suit. Carrying the full load of things, we walked out of the Dasanyuan restaurant.

On Nanjing Road, we were still talking happily when we suddenly saw people surrounding a fallen electric pole. I said to my wife, "It looks like a military vehicle caused trouble again—."

At this time, a man in his thirties, speaking fluent Beijing Mandarin, continued, "Isn't it a military vehicle?" He pointed to a shop with iron doors closed and said, "What a force! It knocked down the electric pole, ran onto the sidewalk, and drove straight into someone's shop..."

"Was anyone injured?" I asked.

"Of course, someone was injured..." he said, and then hurried away.

Suddenly I was awakened by a kind of alertness and quickly touched my pocket. My pen was long gone.

I very upsetly took a pedicab home. To us literati, a pen is like a soldier's gun. A soldier who has been disarmed has lost his inherent courage and combat ability. I was such an absurd soldier.

### Tennyson: Break, Break, Break

— Zhen Quan Shi (Translator)

Break, break, break,

On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!

And I would that my tongue could utter

The thoughts that arise in me.

O well for the fisherman's boy,

That he shouts with his sister at play!

O well for the sailor lad,

That he sings in his boat on the bay!

And the stately ships go on

To their haven under the hill;

But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand,

And the sound of a voice that is still!

Break, break, break,

At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!

But the tender grace of a day that is dead

Will never come back to me.

[This poem was first published in Tennyson's "Poems" in 1842. Tennyson wrote this poem and the long poem "In Memoriam" for the death of his friend Arthur H. Hallam. The latter has become one of the three major elegies in English literature. - Translator]

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"So, who initiated this night raid?" In my imagination, it was like a movie, projecting some terrifying scenes. Spies, counter-spies, counter-counter-spies, all sorts of complex plots intertwined, playing out a terrifying and tragic story. Just thinking about the ending of this story sent chills down my spine.

"You could say it was Mrs. Shaw, or you could say it was me, or you could say it was initiated simultaneously by both of us!" Yaoqun casually replied to me.

"Then what was Mrs. Shaw's motive?" Thinking of the terrible ending of things, I asked Yaoqun.

"She didn't explicitly state it. But..." Yaoqun said calmly, "But I know very well that she also wants to take advantage of the conflict between our two armies to find a way to slip away on her own. According to her, she very much wants to see her old friend, who is now the Commander-in-Chief defending Nankou."

"He's going to sneak through alone?" My doubts deepened.

"That's right." Yaoqun nodded; "Initially, when planning this night raid, just yesterday afternoon, she wanted to invite us to go together. Because I didn't want her to know my subsequent actions, I didn't say anything. She nodded casually, and I don't know why she nodded. Perhaps this afternoon, she will bring up this matter again to discuss with someone, who knows."

Yaoqun and I were talking here. Little Tiger sometimes sat quietly listening on the side; sometimes walked around, strolled a few steps outside, and came back again; presumably taking on the responsibility of guarding. In the corner of the room, Dingyuan, sitting on a pile of straw, was already fast asleep, snoring from time to time, probably because he was extremely tired; so when we spoke, we kept our voices very low, for fear of waking him up.

Regarding Dingyuan's problem, I originally planned to bring it up and discuss it with Yaoqun; to see what Yaoqun's opinion was: should we let him continue to drift along here as he is now? Or should we prepare to take him back to Peiping and entrust him to Mr. W? Or do we have other plans for him? As for me, I very much hope that Dingyuan can return to Peiping, to a sanatorium, whether in the city or in the Western Hills, to let him rest and recover for some time. And wait until his health is fully restored, and then find a way to send him to the south, to join the engineering corps in the army, so that he can also make a career. Because I deeply know that talents like him are greatly needed by any military group.

Yaoqun saw me lower my head in contemplation, knowing that I was thinking, so he also remained silent for the time being. The room was unusually quiet except for Dingyuan's breathing and occasional snoring. Just after these few minutes of silence, I was just about to bring up Dingyuan's problem to Yaoqun when I suddenly saw Little Tiger leap up from the ground, as agile and light as a civet cat; at the same time, he looked at Yaoqun and me, stretched out both hands, and pressed down in the air, looking very nervous.

"What...?" Yaoqun and I were both taken aback; the three words "What's the matter?" had not yet fully left my mouth, Little Tiger glared with a pair of large round eyes, and pressed down even harder on us in the air with his outstretched hands.
