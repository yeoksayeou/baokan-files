### This Morning's Departure Statement: Special Envoy Wedemeyer's Delegation Flies to Japan, Then to Korea; Report Will Be Divided into Facts and Recommendations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The US Embassy announced that General Wedemeyer's special mission will depart Nanjing for Japan at 9:30 AM on the 24th, concluding its one-month stay in China. The group will travel via Tokyo to Seoul for a brief survey of southern Korea. Furthermore, according to Watson, the press advisor to the Wedemeyer mission, Wedemeyer remained at his residence all day on the 23rd, receiving no guests. Besides focusing on official duties, he only interacted with Ambassador Stuart and his advisors, packing his belongings in preparation for the 24th departure. Due to a busy schedule of banquets and discussions this week, the final arrangement and classification of materials were not completed as expected. The mission will take all materials with them, and those arriving later will be forwarded to Seoul for continued study. Wedemeyer's final work report will be submitted to President Truman upon his return to Washington, D.C., with its content roughly divided into two major parts: facts and recommendations, to assist President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall for reference and selection. The mission will issue its final public statement as a farewell address on the morning of the 24th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] This reporter visited the office of the Wedemeyer mission in the US Embassy on the evening of the 23rd. Lieutenant Colonel Harkins, the chief of staff, political advisor Sprouse, and press advisor Watson were packing typewriters and documents. When asked by reporters about the rumor that Wedemeyer would return to China as the US Ambassador to China, spokesman Watson said, "I am unaware of that. I only know that Wedemeyer has spent most of his life in the military and still hopes to serve in a military position in the future. Therefore, after reporting the results of this trip to President Truman, he will return to Fort Meade in Maryland, where the Second Army Headquarters, which Wedemeyer commands, is located." In addition, the mission has added two sergeants as secretaries to assist the busy work of organizing data.

[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Before Special Envoy Wedemeyer flies to Tokyo, three boxes of classified documents, weighing over 500 pounds, will be loaded onto the special plane under armed guard. Mission personnel stated that the classified documents include reports, statistics, and memoranda, which the special envoy will use to draft a formal report to President Truman to decide the future US policy toward China. In addition, about one ton of documents from various sources has been reviewed and abridged by the special envoy and destroyed. The mission continued to work late into the night to organize the last batch of letters and telegrams.

[United Press International, Nanjing, 23rd] High-ranking Chinese official sources said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had asked General Wedemeyer to serve as his military advisor, but Wedemeyer replied that he could not accept this position. Wedemeyer's spokesman Watson neither confirmed nor denied this news, only saying, "I don't know." Wedemeyer succeeded Stilwell as commander of US forces in China in 1944 and has a very deep friendship with Chairman Chiang, so this news is not surprising. Later, an official spokesman for the special mission was invited to comment on this report, saying, "Such things do exist. The Chinese government has repeatedly suggested giving American advisors different positions." However, the special mission cannot currently state whether it will ultimately recommend assistance in advisory, material, or other aspects. Therefore, it cannot comment on such suggestions, as this suggestion is somewhat related to the recommendations we will make in our report to President Truman.

### Wealthy and Poor Children Alike Should Shoulder Heavy Responsibilities, Participating in the Struggle for Political and Economic Stability: Wedemeyer's Advice to Chinese Students

[United Press International, Nanjing, 23rd] A group of Chinese students asked General Wedemeyer to help them study in the United States. Wedemeyer replied that in this "critical moment," students should stay in China and participate in the struggle for vital political and economic stability.

The US Embassy issued a letter on the 23rd in which Wedemeyer replied to a group of Chinese wartime translators, stating, "It is most unfortunate that Chinese students, even some professors, are unwilling to bear the great responsibility of being citizens."

Wedemeyer pointed out that the special treatment given to student soldiers by the government during the war was "unfair and undemocratic." He said, "The sons of the wealthy should fight alongside the sons of the poor, suffering equally. Those who are educated and those who are not share the fruits of victory equally, and they should also bear the responsibility of war equally."

"Every able-bodied man and woman should serve the country with enthusiasm and selflessness," as it is their sacred and unavoidable responsibility.

"In the recently concluded war, those who suffered the most and contributed the most were the working masses of China. Those who endured hardship and danger in the army were mostly illiterate people. In fact, many of them did not even know why they were fighting."

"The sons of farmers were the backbone of the small country's army. On the other hand, student soldiers were all given special preferential treatment by the government, with higher salaries, better equipment, more food, and other special attention. I believe this is unfair and clearly undemocratic."

"I have received many letters and verbal protests from students and intellectuals, all complaining about the stagnation of education and saying that the government should increase funding for schools. I dare to say frankly, what should the government do for the poor farmers who offer their harvests and their sons to the army?"

"I suggest that you seriously consider the above thoughts and discuss them with your friends." I assert that because of the patriotism you have shown during the war, you will agree that every Chinese, whether rich or poor, whether educated or not, has an unwavering responsibility to their country. If true happiness, true unity, and the realization of lasting democracy are desired, then this responsibility must be shared equally."

[Another report] Wedemeyer told members and ministers of the National Government on the 22nd that the Communist Party in China is not purely a military problem, but also a problem of improving the people's living standards.

Wedemeyer also said that the relationship between officials and the people, and between the army and the people, should be improved. The sons of the wealthy, the sons of military officers, and the sons of high-ranking government officials should also be drafted according to the new conscription plan. It is reported that Wedemeyer stated that he was making the above remarks as a friend of China, and not in his capacity as a special envoy.

### Insufficient Reasons for Postponing the General Election

Talks with a senior official of the Election Headquarters

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] A senior official of the Election Headquarters said that only 200 to 300 of the 2,100-plus counties in our country are currently unable to hold elections. The rumor that 22 provinces cannot carry out electoral politics is not true. More than three of the nine northeastern provinces can hold elections, and only parts of Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi provinces cannot promote electoral politics. If the military situation improves, the areas where elections can be held can be increased. The above is in terms of regions. In addition, there should be no problems with elections for Mongolia, Tibet, overseas Chinese, border areas, professions, and women. Therefore, the reasons given by some people for postponing the general election are insufficient.

### New Mexican Ambassador, Eguiluz, Arrives in Nanjing Today

It has also instructed commanders to pay attention to the nurturing of new recruits, break down the boundaries between officers and soldiers, improve the food for soldiers, instill political knowledge, enrich recreational and medical facilities, promote soldiers' health, and cultivate good qualities. It has also instructed supervisory officials to dispatch personnel for on-site inspections at any time.

### The US President Is Extremely Dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's Breach of Faith; Soviet Newspaper Criticizes the Wedemeyer Mission

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 23rd broadcast: US Congressman Sabath had a long talk with President Truman yesterday to review the international situation. It is said that the US President is extremely dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's breach of faith.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 23rd broadcast: The Soviet Navy's official newspaper "Red Fleet" published today that the US will lend 2 billion US dollars to the Chinese government and equip 20 divisions of the Chinese army. The newspaper fiercely criticized the Wedemeyer special mission, believing that the mission has made the connection between the Chinese Kuomintang and the US government even closer.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs maintained silence on the US again protesting the Soviet Union's continued occupation of Dalian. It could not be confirmed whether the envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had discussed this matter with Foreign Minister Wang the other day. However, according to authoritative sources, the authorities are paying attention to this matter as always, and the time to reaffirm our position or take appropriate steps is not far away.

### Most of the Measures for Implementing Economy Have Been Drafted

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The measures for implementing the Outline of Economy and Consumption have been drafted separately by the relevant agencies, and most have been completed. The measures drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs were sent to the Executive Yuan on the 23rd, and the measures for encouraging the use of domestic goods drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs are also expected to be sent out next Monday. The implementation measures drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs include the following seven types: (1) Measures for Implementing the Movement to Strictly Observe Time (regulations on time for work, meetings, banquets, receptions, transportation, and entertainment); (2) Measures for Implementing Work Relief; (3) Measures for Establishing Vocational Training Centers; (4) Measures for Promoting the Abolition of New Year's Gifts; (5) Measures for Economizing on Gifts for Celebrations and Commemorations; (6) Measures for Economizing on Banquets (regulations on ordinary social events, receptions for foreign guests, etc.); (7) Measures for Restricting Banquets in Government Agencies and State-Owned Enterprises.

### Measures for Banning Dancing May Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan Tomorrow

Content Takes into Account the Actual Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The implementation measures for the prohibition of commercial dance halls, as stipulated in the Outline of Economy Measures, are being drafted by the Ministry of Interior and are expected to be submitted to the Executive Yuan next Monday. According to the person in charge of the Department of Etiquette of the Ministry of Interior, who is drafting these measures, "In drafting these measures, in addition to emphasizing the application and scope of the law, we also take into account the actual social situation. Therefore, we attach great importance to the opinions of local governments. It cannot be confirmed that the Shanghai Municipal Government has exchanged views with the Ministry and provided a written opinion for the Ministry's reference. However, since Shanghai has many dance halls and people who rely on dancing for a living, the Ministry will pay attention to this when drafting the measures. As for what constitutes a 'commercial dance hall' and what steps will be taken to ban dancing, we will refer to opinions from all parties." When asked by reporters whether the report that Shanghai dance halls would use a lottery system to ban them in batches was true, he said that banning dancing would be implemented step by step.

### It Is Undecided Whether to Continue the Four-Bank Joint Industrial Loan; Some Influential People Advocate Stopping the Loan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] After the Four-Bank Joint Office decided to tighten lending, various parties speculated about the inside story of this decision. According to a senior staff member participating in economic decision-making who told this reporter, the decision to tighten lending is probably a sign before a major change, because the government has not yet made a final decision on this policy. Some influential people believe that the purpose of the loan is solely to increase production and stabilize prices. However, in fact, the importance of currency in modern production conditions cannot exceed raw materials, power, and technology. Therefore, if the source of raw materials is not smooth and power technology is not improved, the result of the loan is that factories not only cannot use it to increase production, but also use it for speculation and profit, resulting in increased floating capital and stimulating prices. Therefore, it is better to stop the loan. However, the general public believes that although the implementation of the loan policy in the past has not fully achieved the expected goals, many factories have been able to maintain it for many years. If the loan is stopped, some large-scale factories that rely on loans will inevitably stop operating, resulting in an increase in unemployment on the one hand and a decrease in production on the other. Therefore, the loan should continue. The dispute between the two sides is unresolved, but the former opinion seems to be dominant, and the Four-Bank Joint Office's recent decision to carefully consider loans is the result of being influenced by this opinion.

### Foreign Exchange Settlement Banks Are Designated as Twelve

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 23rd] The Beiping Branch of the National Bank recently received an order to determine the twelve designated foreign exchange settlement banks in the city, including: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central Trust of China, Postal Savings Bureau, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, China Industrial Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque de l'Indochine, and The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (not yet reopened). Citibank does not do business with the public, and HSBC reportedly did not meet the conditions when Fu Chu applied, so they were not included.

### The Agreement Between Us and the Hong Kong Government Is Extremely Extensive

Announcement Date Delayed Due to Reasons

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The economic and financial agreement between us and the Hong Kong government, which has been negotiated for several months, includes a wide range of issues, such as anti-smuggling, taxation, exchange, and crackdown on the black market. It was signed in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month by Shao Zenghua, the representative of our Central Bank, and Ross, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong. Zhang Jia'ao, the Governor of the Central Bank, has brought the full text of this agreement to the government in Nanjing yesterday. Our government and the Hong Kong government originally scheduled to announce it simultaneously on the 23rd. According to sources, since the British government announced new economic measures at midnight on the 20th of this month and suspended the acceptance of US dollars in pound sterling, the exchange rate and several related issues in this agreement have yet to be resolved.

### The Issue of Reporter Identity Can Be Decided in the Short Term

Gu Zhengkang's Reply to the Capital Press

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Liu Qirui, Xu Junwu, Deng Jixing, and three other directors of the Capital News Reporters Association, went to the Ministry of Social Affairs this afternoon on behalf of the Association to state their views on the issue of determining the identity of reporters, and were personally received by Minister Gu Zhengkang. Liu and others stated that the status of journalists is extremely high, and in free occupations, they have a direct influence on guiding society to advance democracy. As the general election is approaching, the government should promptly determine the identity of reporters, in order to prevent abuse and avoid disputes, and set an example for democratic politics. Minister Gu replied that the Ministry of Social Affairs believes that the issue of determining the identity of reporters is extremely urgent. The Vocational Group Election Office has already paid attention to it and is currently exchanging views with the Ministry of Interior. A decision can be made in the shortest possible time, and the expectations of the press will not be disappointed. Liu and others were satisfied and immediately resigned. Due to time constraints, they decided to go to the Ministry of Interior on the 25th to express their opinions and urge the prompt implementation of the Journalists Law.

Although the duties are similar to those of the Inspectors, the powers are greater. As long as there is evidence of a crime, punishment can be given according to law without reporting first. We have received many anonymous letters."

### The Authorities Are Considering Revising the Entire Set of Measures for Gold Notes and Treasury Bonds; Zhang Jia'ao Denies the Saying That Gold Is Nationalized

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun said on the 23rd that the gold issue is being discussed by the All-Economic Council, and the issue of handling US treasury bonds is being studied by the Ministry of Finance. He categorically declined to comment on the reform of the currency system.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Following the revision of the foreign exchange control measures, in order to cooperate with the implementation of these measures, the government is considering formulating, in the future, it may refer to the US black market, first stipulate a certain ratio between the US dollar and gold, and then according to this ratio, determine the daily legal tender price of gold based on the daily foreign exchange market price in China. However, the nature of this measure is not equivalent to a complete opening of the gold market, because gold transactions in the future will still be limited to the people and the national bank, or its designated banks. (2) The decision to stop selling US treasury bonds allows the issue of how to repay the already sold portion, but the relevant parties still have disputes. One group of people advocates repaying according to the foreign exchange market price to maintain the government's credibility, while another group believes that if repaid at the market price, the country's losses would be too great, and it would be better to give up higher interest rates when repaying. (3) Except for the unfinished part of the barter debt repayment by the Resources Committee and the determined purchase part of the spring silkworm loan, the rest of the export goods will be stopped from being purchased, and all subsidies will be stopped.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 23rd] Governor of the Central Bank Zhang Jia'ao met with this agency's reporter alone on the 23rd and stated that the Chinese government has no intention of nationalizing gold or forcing the people to sell gold to the government at the open market price. The rumors about this matter in recent days are all unfounded. Zhang also revealed that the authorities are studying issues related to short-term US treasury bonds and believe that a satisfactory solution will be found soon. When Zhang spoke about speculators raising the prices of export commodities after the government promulgated the new foreign exchange regulations, he hinted that the government might take action to stop them. However, Zhang then presented a price list of China's main export commodities, showing that the prices of various items have only increased slightly since the new foreign exchange regulations were promulgated. He believes that China can continue to import urgently needed food and fuel to stabilize the people's lives without harming the progress of China's industrial recovery work. Zhang said that the limit of a maximum of 100 US dollars carried by travelers entering and leaving China is based on international customs rules.

### The Center of US Trade in the Far East May Be Replaced by Shanghai in Tokyo; US Industrialists Will Invest Heavily in Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] After Japan resumed foreign trade, several American industrialists who recently arrived in Japan were ordered to specifically investigate the possibility of making Tokyo the center of their company's Far East trade. They told a Central News Agency reporter separately that the hope of making Shanghai the center of their company's Far East trade has almost vanished. Macau, Tokyo, and Hong Kong are expected to rise up and replace them as the main ports for their Far East trade, and said that because the Hong Kong government's control over trade is increasing day by day, the importance of Hong Kong is also gradually disappearing. They specifically pointed out that although Macau is a notorious gambling den on the coast of South China, they believe that it is the back door for our country to import foreign goods, so its status has become suddenly important. They continued that shortly after Japan's surrender, their company transported a batch of goods to Shanghai, and has not continued to transport goods to our country in the past six months. They believe that Tokyo is the "possible clearing station" for the Far East, and finished products manufactured in Tokyo or other cities in Japan with American capital can be supplied to the Far East market at low prices. However, they are not yet sure whether the situation in Japan after the occupation will allow the realization of this plan. But in any case, this may have been determined and cannot be changed, that is, the vision of several American companies has gradually shifted from Shanghai to Tokyo, regarding it as the center of Far East trade, and are preparing to invest heavily in Japan.

Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Declares That There Can Be a Trade Surplus After Three Years

[Another Dispatch] Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani Chozaburo replied to a question from the Commerce Committee of the House of Councillors yesterday, saying that Japan's trade can have a surplus after three years, but this depends on whether the plan set by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to produce 15 million tons of coal annually for the next three years can be realized.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] According to the figures released by the Hong Kong Immigration Department, Japanese goods have gradually become active in the Hong Kong market, in addition to American goods maintaining the top spot. The import value of American goods last month was over 28.568 million yuan, and the value of American goods shipped out was over 4.899 million yuan. In the first seven months of this year, the import of American goods was 169.52 million yuan, and the export in the same period was 80.287 million yuan, with an import surplus of 89 million yuan. The import from Japan last month was 5.068 million yuan, and the import from Japan in the past seven months was 88.465 million yuan, with an import surplus of 7.7 million yuan.

[Central News Agency, Canberra, 23rd] The Australian government has ordered the resumption of private trade with Japan, but permits will only be issued when satisfactory financial regulations have been established to conduct trade between Japan and the Sterling Area. The Allied occupation authorities in Japan still control private trade and do not allow any contracts to be concluded before September 1. However, Australian merchants who had contractual relations with Japan before the war have been allowed to conduct business activities and negotiate new contracts.

There Is Still No Perfect Countermeasure for the Problem of Smuggling Japanese Goods

Wu Yun Chu Told Reporters

[Our Dispatch] Regarding the selection of industrial representatives for the business delegation to Japan, according to Wu Yun Chu, letters have been sent to the branch offices of the Industrial Association in various places to solicit opinions and ask them to send the list of selected representatives to Shanghai. It is expected that all representatives can be produced within two weeks. Wu himself said that he is not familiar with business and is unwilling to go to Japan. He also said that as a result of the industry and commerce representatives going to Beijing several times, the government has respected public opinion, and all commodities that can be produced domestically and in Taiwan are not intended to be imported from Japan. On the contrary, Japanese raw materials that are useful to us, such as rayon, sulfur, and copper, are all on the list of imports. Japanese machine parts are useful for the factories we have received, so they should be allowed to be imported. The smuggling of Japanese goods will be a major problem in the future, but so far there is no perfect countermeasure. American people believe that Japan today is also a country with high wages, so the competition of Japanese goods is not to be feared. In fact, compared with China, Japanese wages are far lower. According to news from the textile industry in Shanghai, the wages of our textile workers are actually eight times higher than those of Japanese workers, and it is impossible to compete.

### Recovery of Shangcai in Southern Henan; Remnant Bandits Pursued, in a Dilemma; Bandits in Western Henan Attacked Vigorously While Crossing the River Yesterday

[Our newspaper, Bengbu, 23rd] The Communist bandits trapped on the border of Henan and Anhui are in a dilemma. Shangcai has been recovered by the National Army, and the Communist bandits are fleeing southeast. One group has reached Dongyangbu in Runan, and another has reached Longkouji north of Xincai, still preparing to cross the Huai River and flee south. The National Army, advancing westward along the Huai River, is currently pursuing the troops to Wulongji (southeast of Xixian, on the north bank of the Huai River).

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] The remnants of Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns of Communist bandits, numbering approximately 40,000, who had fled to the northern foothills of the Dabie Mountains, are now surrounded layer by layer by the National Army in the triangular area of the Hong and Ru Rivers, according to the pre-planned strategy. Liu's 2nd Column, with over 6,000 men, attempted to harass Yingshang on the border of Henan and Anhui on the 22nd but was fiercely intercepted by the National Army at Nanzhaoji (12 kilometers southwest of Yingshang) and Huanggangji. The bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated towards the Sanjian River, appearing to be attacking Gushi. This time, Liu's bandits fled from western Shandong to southern Henan, originally intending to jump out of the National Army's encirclement to avoid annihilation and solve the problem of food supply. However, they were pursued and intercepted by the National Army along the way. The bandits fought during the day and had to break through and flee at night, averaging one meal every two days. Currently, the officers and soldiers are all emaciated and have swollen feet and legs. Since the 19th, over a thousand people have surrendered to the National Army every day.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 23rd] Approximately 2,000 Communist bandits on the north bank of the Yellow River in western Henan crossed the Yellow River in groups from Kuangkou, under the jurisdiction of Xin'an, this morning at daybreak, taking advantage of the brief respite after a heavy rain.

Editorial

### Farewell to Special Envoy Wedemeyer

General Wedemeyer, by order of President Truman, led a fact-finding mission to China to investigate the actual political, economic, and military situation in our country. The mission has been completed and is scheduled to leave China this morning to fly to Tokyo. General Wedemeyer arrived in our capital from Guam at 5:00 p.m. on July 22 and immediately began his investigation work. He traveled extensively in the summer heat, taking pains to personally go to Ping, Shen, Qing, Hu, Taiwan, Guangzhou and other places to "seek facts," meet with people from all walks of life, and conduct extensive consultations. It has been just one month since then, and he is already embarking on a journey to fly to Korea. We cannot help but express our regret at the departure of this "friend of China." In particular, General Wedemeyer's candid advice is worth our country's reflection and self-reflection.

After General Wedemeyer leaves China and returns to his country, he will certainly prepare a report on his observations of China's political situation and submit it to President Truman as the basis for the United States to adopt a new policy toward China. The content of the report is currently unknown, and we do not want to speculate arbitrarily. However, on the eve of General Wei's departure from China, he attended a symposium at the chairman's residence and frankly criticized China's current situation to our Central Health Bureau. According to reports from various sources, the general meaning can be summarized as follows: Everything in China is extremely promising, but unfortunately, nothing can achieve the expected results. The crux of the problem is "poor human planning" and incomplete utilization of human resources. (1) Politics: Although the government has made some progress in recruiting talent and improving administrative efficiency, it is still insufficient. It is hoped that the government can accept free criticism from all parties, eliminate corrupt officials, and prohibit civil servants from engaging in business. (2) Economy: China has abundant resources and ample wealth, but unfortunately, it has not yet been developed, resulting in goods being discarded on the ground and wealth hidden in "self." The total amount of private Chinese assets in the United States is quite large. If they can be well managed and used properly, it will be enough to promote China's economic development. (3) Military Affairs: The treatment of soldiers is too low and must be improved as soon as possible so that officers and soldiers can share weal and woe. In order to save military expenses, it is especially necessary to adopt a policy of elite troops. (4) Communist Bandit Problem: The government must not regard the Communist bandit problem as a purely military problem. In addition to military affairs, political forces are also needed, and improving people's lives is of utmost urgency.

The above-mentioned points are indeed worth our country's introspection. General Wei's frank and sincere attitude is especially praiseworthy. The Chinese people have always held a philosophical view of "treating people with sincerity" in the way of making friends, and "words of loyalty and trustworthiness" is the beginning of establishing sincerity. As the saying goes, "Cultivate words to establish their sincerity." In addition to humbly accepting General Wei's kindness, we would also like to offer some slightly different perspectives for reference by General Wei and our general American allies.

First, Special Envoy Wedemeyer spent a month in China, traveling tirelessly from Beijing and Shanghai to North China, from North China to the Northeast, and then from Beijing to Taiwan and South China. He was tireless and his enthusiasm is admirable. However, we do not know how many credible facts Special Envoy Wei actually sought in various places, and not entirely the same as hearsay? Yesterday, various newspapers disclosed a memorandum jointly submitted to Special Envoy Wei by some people from all walks of life in Shanghai, which could not help but remind us that Special Envoy Wei came to Shanghai three times, and why did he never seek to meet with and exchange opinions with the responsible persons of the Shanghai local groups, industrial and commercial education groups? In terms of humbly seeking information and conducting thorough investigations, there are some regrets. What's more, we have heard that the people Special Envoy Wei met were mostly pre-arranged by his subordinates, as long as they had opinions different from the government, no matter what their social status, reputation, or the value of their opinions, they had priority for interviews. If so, we are deeply afraid that his "hearsay" will not only be unhelpful to Sino-U.S. relations, but also to the overall world situation.

Second, we completely agree in principle with Special Envoy Wedemeyer's advice to the Chinese government to reform itself voluntarily. We believe that China needs reform in politics, economy, and military affairs, and without reform, it may not be able to extricate itself. However, we also believe that after eight years of war, China has suffered greatly and is like a patient just recovering from a serious illness. It can only recover slowly. If we want to talk about thorough and drastic reforms, it is not something that can be done urgently. China has a history of four or five thousand years, and the traditional concepts of the people and the social customs do not allow China to reform completely immediately. The national characters of China and the United States are not entirely the same, and Americans sometimes have a somewhat subjective view of China's political situation. The reason why some people in the United States cannot deeply understand China's politics is also because of this. Therefore, we hope that when Special Envoy Wei investigates China's political situation, he should pay special attention to the essence of Chinese culture and the stage of China's evolution, and never use American standards to measure China's current politics.

Third, we want the Chinese and American people to pay special attention to the history of friendship between the two countries. The foundation of Sino-U.S. relations can be said to have been laid after the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900. At that time, the theory of "partitioning" was rampant, and China's situation was precarious. Fortunately, U.S. Secretary of State John Hay issued a statement in 1902, proposing the Open Door Policy, which broke the sphere of influence and turned the crisis into safety. Since then, the Chinese people have realized that the United States has no ambition to territorially aggress China. Until the "September 18th" Incident, Stimson's non-recognition doctrine deepened the friendship between China and the United States. During this war, Sino-U.S. relations underwent another baptism of blood and became friends in need, and the great achievements of U.S. President Roosevelt at the Yalta Conference made us never forget it. We believe that the close relationship between China and the United States has a long history of development and cannot be exchanged for any material price. All Chinese and American people should especially cherish and love each other, and should not allow this extraordinary friendship to be diminished due to temporary commercial interests. However, unfortunately, there is a small group of people in China who are trying their best to alienate the deep friendship between China and the United States, thinking that there is room for him to use one country against another for own benefits. We call on Special Envoy Wedemeyer and our American allies to pay attention to this, for the sake of the overall world situation and for the sake of long-term peace, never be fooled by this!

Fourth, we would also like to point out that there are also a few people in the United States who advocate supporting Japan and want to regard Japan as the stabilizing force in the Far East in the future. This view not only runs counter to the wartime U.S. view of China as the stabilizing force in the Far East in theory, but is also practically impossible. At the beginning of the 20th century, did Britain not form an alliance with Japan, and how did Japan repay Britain? Before the Anti-Japanese War, did China not want to be friends with Japan, and how did Japan repay China? Can Japan have integrity in the future? It is still unknown. Japan verbally said friendship, but its intention was to invade, which eventually led to the Second World War. This historical lesson is worth the attention of the U.S. authorities. Is the superficial respect of the Japanese people a sincere and willing surrender of the Japanese people to the United States? "A gentleman can be deceived by his proper way." Special Envoy Wei is flying to Tokyo this morning, and we wonder what his feelings will be.

Finally, we want to reiterate that the Chinese people are extremely willing to maintain friendly relations with the United States at all times, and whether the United States actually provides aid to China is something that the United States should consider itself. The Chinese people do not care about this, because we deeply know the way of "self-reliance." Under the premise of not harming China's sovereignty and national character, any suggestions made by Special Envoy Wedemeyer or any advice given by the United States is welcome by us. On the contrary, the Chinese people will never want to see the government damage its sovereignty and destroy its national character in order to seek American aid. This is China's style and the integrity of the Chinese people.

### Resources Commission Actively Plans to Rebuild Power Equipment in Hunan and Guangxi

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The power equipment in Hunan and Guangxi provinces has been severely damaged since the Hunan-Guangxi Campaign in the 33rd year of the Republic, and the Resources Commission is currently planning to rebuild it. In Changsha, the pre-war power generation capacity was 10,000 kilowatts, but the equipment was almost completely lost during the restoration. A 1,000-kilowatt generator has been purchased from the Materials Supply Bureau and was installed on the 13th of this month and can be officially supplied with electricity. In addition, several generators allocated by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) will be distributed in Changsha with a 2,500-kilowatt generator. Some of the equipment has already arrived. After power generation, the total available power capacity will reach 3,500 kilowatts. However, the local market is prosperous, and this capacity is still insufficient. The committee has ordered a 5,000-kilowatt generator from the United States to supplement it. The large-scale motors needed for the Xiangtan industrial zone must wait until the implementation of the Japanese compensation case before they can be realized. However, two 1,000-kilowatt generators from UNRRA have already been allocated, and all the equipment has been transported and the installation has actively begun. As for Liuzhou, since the 500-kilowatt new generator at the Liuzhou power plant began supplying electricity in July of this year, the market has also become more prosperous. The plant is now repairing the original 2,000-kilowatt generator and started a test run on the 8th of this month. After that, there should be no shortage of electricity in Liuzhou. In addition, the committee recently received a telegram from the Jibei Power Company stating that the company's 500-kilowatt generator in the Zhangjiakou power plant has also officially started supplying electricity and the situation is good.

He will present Argentina's views in the Political Committee of the General Assembly.

### Security Council Discusses Anglo-Egyptian Dispute, Egypt Opposes Direct Negotiations, A Disturbance Occurs in the Spectator Gallery

[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] In the Security Council chamber today, United Nations guards twice stopped disturbances by Egyptian spectators. First, a young man with a beard wearing a red Turkish fez was dragged out of the chamber by two guards. Then, an Egyptian man stood up in the spectator gallery and shouted slogans such as "Freedom or the death of international peace, death to the Security Council," "Down with imperialism," and "Long live the Nile Valley." This person was also escorted out of the chamber by the guards.

[Reuters Dispatch] After order was restored, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy stood up and spoke, firmly opposing the Brazilian proposal that Britain and Egypt resume direct negotiations, and firmly stated that the Egyptian government is determined to protect Sudan from separation. He also declared that if the Security Council adopts the Brazilian resolution, it will not eliminate the existing threats to peace, and Egypt may have to submit another appeal to the Security Council. Nokrashy welcomed the amendment proposed by the Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu, which added the words "the British government has already partially withdrawn its troops stationed in Egypt and is preparing to negotiate a complete withdrawal" to the Brazilian resolution. He also said that the Brazilian resolution did not specifically mention the end of British rule in Sudan. He pointed out that the territorial integrity of Sudan has been threatened, so he must reiterate that the Egyptian government is determined to protect Sudan from disintegration and enable the Sudanese people to manage their affairs under an organization united with Egypt. Nokrashy finally stated that the Egyptian government believes that the Brazilian resolution is intended to evade the primary responsibility that the Security Council should bear.

### Australia Formally Requests the General Assembly to Review the Veto System

[Reuters, Lake Success, 22nd] Australia, which is most strongly opposed to the system of powerful countries exercising the veto power in the Security Council, formally requested today that a motion to "re-examine the resolution established by the previous General Assembly on the issue of the veto power" be included in the supplementary agenda of the next United Nations General Assembly. Australia also requested that the General Assembly examine to what extent the proposals contained in the resolutions of the previous General Assembly have been implemented. It is expected that the small countries' criticism of the veto system will be a tense scene in the next United Nations General Assembly, which will begin on September 16. Argentina believes that the inconsistent voting method, namely the veto power, should be abolished, and requests that a special committee discuss how to change this regulation.

### United Nations Agency Decides to Continue Intervening in the Indo-Dutch Dispute, But Opinions on the Method of Intervention Still Differ

[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] The United Nations seems to have decided to continue intervening in the Indo-Dutch dispute, although opinions on the method of intervention still differ. However, it is generally agreed that the Security Council can decide on the method of intervention on Monday or Tuesday, at the very least organizing a monitoring group of the eleven countries of the Security Council to investigate the extent to which the United Nations truce order is being complied with.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 23rd] Soviet Representative Gromyko criticized the proposal made by China and Australia in the Security Council today to order the consuls stationed in Batavia to report to the Security Council on the current situation in Indonesia. He believed that the Security Council could not trust the opinions and actions of the consuls of the three countries, Britain, France, and the United States, stationed in Batavia, because the positions taken by Britain, France, and the United States on the Indonesian issue were all favorable to the Netherlands, and the joint proposal made by China and Australia in this regard was suspected of circumventing the United Nations organization. If the Security Council wants to deal with this issue, it must establish two committees, one to supervise the recent truce order and one to implement arbitration, or establish a single committee with the functions of the previous two. The Security Council must act quickly, and these two committees or one committee must be composed of Security Council member countries, and the number of its members may be less than eleven, but they must be representatives of the Security Council member countries. Prior to that, Gromyko also rejected a resolution proposed by US Representative Johnson, which suggested that the Security Council make mediation suggestions to the parties to the dispute to help resolve the dispute peacefully. In order to carry out this assistance task, the Security Council should establish a three-member committee, in which two members are selected by the parties to the dispute from the members of the Security Council, and the remaining one member is selected by the former two selected members from the members of the Security Council. Dutch Representative Kleffens attended the meeting and warned the Security Council that what the Security Council could do and has done is beneficial to extremist elements. He reiterated that the Netherlands does not recognize the Security Council's right to deal with this "internal matter that does not threaten international peace."

### International Trade Conference Discusses the Contents of the Draft Trade Charter

[Reuters, Geneva, 22nd] Jin Wensi, the head of the Chinese delegation, expressed his frank opinion on the draft international trade charter while discussing it at the International Trade Conference here today. He said: Although it is good to maintain a broad basis for the charter to accommodate various opinions, he found it difficult to understand why some existing trade barriers were still tolerated, since all other restrictive measures of a similar nature had already been prohibited. Jin said that after describing China's loss of balance in its international payments and the failure of its economic recovery plan to be implemented, "China hopes to have the opportunity to study more closely some provisions in the charter that will not alleviate but will increase China's current difficulties." According to reports, Jin will speak at the plenary session of the preparatory committee for the Havana World Trade Conference in November this year. The draft trade charter must be approved by the plenary session of the preparatory committee before it is submitted to the Havana Conference.

### Japan to Adopt Dumping Policy to Compete for Foreign Markets

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] In order to compete for foreign trade, the Japanese government will not adopt a controlled price system for exports, and has decided to set up a committee within the price bureau that specializes in determining the prices of exports. This committee will have the right to determine exceptional selling prices for the purpose of promoting certain exports. In other words, the committee will have the right to determine the dumping price for exports, regardless of their cost.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Foreign business representatives who have arrived in Japan have begun trading in various places, and have mostly criticized Japanese goods for their outdated and unpopular styles, poor quality, and high prices, and believe that improvements are needed.

### Britain, the United States, and France Meet in London to Discuss Germany's Industrial Level, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Formally Request to be Provided with Meeting Information

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Representatives from Britain, the United States, and France began secret meetings here today to discuss the previous decision by Britain and the United States to raise the level of German industry, especially steel production. The meeting place is Lancaster Hall, where the representatives of the four foreign ministers discussed the German-Austrian peace treaty this spring.

Judging from the initial signs of the meeting, the situation of the daily meetings thereafter will be kept secret. Today's initial meeting likely only discussed the procedural issues of the meeting. According to people close to the three delegations, the topics discussed today included: (1) the way the news of the meeting is disseminated externally; (2) the discussion of the requirements of other relevant countries to provide information on the meeting; (3) the order of discussion of the items on the agenda. The meeting is expected to last no more than a few days, and the way it publishes news to the outside world is expected to be to issue a short communique after the first meeting, and then issue a final communique at the end of the meeting. According to very reliable sources, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have formally requested that the results of the London talks be made known to them, and the Netherlands has also requested that no final decision on Germany's industrial level be made before its opinions have been sought. This request is expected to be discussed at today's first meeting. It is heard that the British delegation is expected to support the requests of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to provide information. According to the Potsdam Conference, the German steel industry was set at an annual production level of 5.8 million tons, but the actual production in 1946 was only 2.5 million tons. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov expressed his intention at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference to raise it to an annual production of 10 million to 13 million tons, and the provisional target agreed upon by Generals Clay and Robertson in July this year is said to be 11.5 million tons.

Senior British and American officials discussed the non-discrimination clauses in the agreement regarding trade between the two countries, but no agreement was reached. Although Eady returned home after the United States agreed to Britain's suspension of the convertibility of pounds to dollars, the remaining members of his delegation will remain here to discuss the "trade without discrimination" clauses in the agreement. According to this clause, Britain must purchase American products unless it can purchase such products from other sources at lower prices. Britain must also abolish the imperial preference system and the trade privileges it grants to its dominions.

[United Press, Seoul, 23rd] It was learned today that the US military authorities have proposed to the Soviet Union that a Korean people's vote be held under international supervision as a way to break the stalemate between the US and the Soviet Union on the issue of the form of the future Korean government.

Brown Responds to Soviet Accusations

[Reuters, Seoul, 22nd] The Soviet delegation to the US-Soviet Joint Commission today held a reception for reporters in Seoul, accusing North Korea of destroying left-wing newspapers and arresting staff and groups, which hindered the work of the US-Soviet Joint Commission in establishing a temporary Korean government. A Soviet spokesman said that the targets of destruction were those who supported the Moscow Agreement of 1945 on the trusteeship of Korea, and he also called on the US delegation to restore the work of the Joint Commission. Major General Brown, Director of the US delegation, said afterwards that the Soviet delegation was attempting to interfere in the work of the South Korean government in Korea, and that it was not the task of the Joint Commission to govern Korea.

### Movie Theater Strike Breaks Out: Over Ten Theaters Stop Selling Tickets; Morning Shows on Sunday Unlikely to Open; Social Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Convene Labor and Management Today for Mediation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the Meiqi Grand Theater's staff objecting to the agreement and failing to prioritize the employment of unemployed members of the union, workers began a slowdown starting at 1:30 PM yesterday. Upon hearing the news, workers at other theaters responded one after another, and by evening, over ten theaters, including Da Guangming, Nanjing, Hu Guang, Guotai, Carlton, Da Hua, Jinmen, Lido, Jin Du, Paris, Queen, and Xin Guang, were caught in the whirlpool. Other theaters remained open as usual. To prevent the situation from escalating, the Social Affairs Bureau urgently dispatched personnel late at night to the union to persuade them, and scheduled a negotiation between labor and management for this morning. It is unlikely that the aforementioned theaters will be able to open their Sunday morning shows. Whether or not the afternoon shows will be screened will depend on the outcome of this morning's negotiations. Those who went on strike yesterday were members of the Second Branch of the Movie Theater Workers' Union, including ticket sellers, ticket checkers, ticket takers, and errand boys. The workers of the First Branch (projection room) continued to work as usual.

At the end of last year, the labor and management of the movie theater industry signed a written record stipulating that each theater should prioritize hiring unemployed members of the union when adding staff. Recently, three White Russian female ticket takers at the Meiqi Grand Theater returned to their country, and the theater hired three local girls to replace them from outside. The union wrote to the Social Affairs Bureau, accusing the theater of violating the agreement. Before the Social Affairs Bureau could convene labor and management for mediation after receiving the report, the workers of the Meiqi Grand Theater launched a slowdown at 1:30 PM yesterday. The tickets for the first show had already been sold, and it was screened as usual. The performance was stopped from the second show onward. After the news spread, other movie theaters responded one after another, and the union sent out "pickets" to various theaters. By the evening, over ten theaters, including Da Guangming, which were caught in the whirlpool, had also stopped selling tickets, but the movies were still being shown as usual, and those who had already purchased tickets could still watch them. Only Meiqi, Jinmen, and Da Hua were completely shut down. Upon hearing the news, the various district patrol bureaus dispatched a large number of officers to maintain order in the theaters. There was a slight dispute in front of the Xin Guang Theater, but fortunately, nothing serious happened.

Personnel Sent to Persuade; No Results

Upon receiving the report, Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Fan Zhenbang, Chief of the Mediation Section, seeing that the situation was gradually deteriorating and might affect all movie theaters in the city, urgently dispatched Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Chief of the Mediation Section, and Zhu Guilin to the Second Branch of the Union late at night to persuade them. At that time, workers from various theaters who had participated in the slowdown were gathered there. Deputy Chief Gu began to persuade them, telling them that while it was inappropriate for the Meiqi Theater to violate the agreement, the workers' rash action was also inconsiderate. If the employer violated the agreement, the labor side could report it to the Social Affairs Bureau, which would convene mediation. If the employer still repeatedly refused to attend the negotiations or ignored the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation, the Social Affairs Bureau could file a lawsuit with the court to enforce it. The most serious administrative punishment would be to revoke its business license. Now the workers' report claimed that the Meiqi Grand Theater had violated the agreement, and the Social Affairs Bureau had not yet convened mediation when the workers took this action, which also affected other movie theaters that had not violated the labor-management agreement. Their actions really needed to be corrected. The persuasion did not end until 11:00 PM, and they telegraphed Director Shen and Chief Fan about the situation. In order to prevent the situation from escalating, even though today is Sunday, labor and management will still be convened for mediation to find a solution.

In addition, the Movie Theater Business Association is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on this day to discuss countermeasures. The chairman of the association, Liang Qitian, is the person in charge of the Meiqi Grand Theater.

### Wang Xifan Re-tried for Allegedly Manufacturing Military Cloth for the Enemy

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Xifan's case of suspected traitor was tried in the High Court yesterday. Wang was accused of raising funds to organize the Yuantong Cloth Factory before the war. During the period of the fall, he cooperated with the enemy's Gongda Yarn Factory to change Yuantong into a Yida Dyeing Factory. He served as the chairman of the factory and used the power of the enemy and puppets to successively occupy more than 100 acres of nearby people's land. He colluded with the Japanese factory director Takao Naoshi and Inoue Mitsujiro to extract materials and manufacture military cloth.

Subsequently, nine workers of the factory, including Wu Shenhu, jointly reported the case, and the High Prosecutor's Office filed a lawsuit.

### Highway Robbers on Qinghu Road: Investigation Shows They Were Remnants of the Former New Fourth Army; The Wounded American is Not Seriously Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] A gang of bandits robbed a car on Qinghu Road on the morning of the 21st and shot an American. The details have been recorded in yesterday's communications section of this newspaper. Since the incident, the security authorities in charge of security in this city have attached great importance to it. Yesterday, Tao Gengrong, chief of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Bureau's Criminal Investigation Section, and staff member Xu Guoji and others went to the scene to investigate. The robbed vehicle was a small jeep owned by the US Navy Office, with the vehicle number 12811. The injured American was George Lawton, an employee of the office. He is currently being treated at the US Naval Hospital. It is reported that his injuries are not serious and he will be discharged from the hospital in about a week.

According to George, he and his colleague Pan Lai and two girlfriends drove a Navy Jeep to Sheshan for fun that day. When they returned after enjoying themselves, it was already 12:00 late at night. When the car passed the Fangjiayao area of the 15th Bridge on Qinghu Road (under the jurisdiction of Qingpu County), more than a dozen bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Half of them were wearing grass green uniforms and held guns, ordering the car to stop. George and others did not pay attention at first, so they accelerated forward, which angered the bandits. They opened fire, and a bullet hit George in the buttocks. He eventually lost his driving ability due to his injuries and crashed into the rice fields on the side of the road. The bandits took the opportunity to surround them and beat George and Pan Lai with gun handles. Several bandits began to loot, taking more than 300,000 yuan in legal tender, a string of keys, and a lighter. At this time, a truck full of fishmongers happened to pass by. The bandits abandoned the car and rushed to the middle of the road to intercept and rob the truck. It took a long time. After that, they robbed another truck in the same way. Until 6:00 in the morning, because they saw a military vehicle driving from Shanghai, the bandits fled in all directions. Because the wheels of George and others' car were stuck in the mud, they could not start. They were helped by passers-by to push the car to the road, and Pan Lai drove back to Shanghai. He immediately sent the injured person to the Naval Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the authorities. Yesterday, the US Naval Hospital sent the bullet taken from George's buttocks to the police station for inspection. According to the police investigation, it was learned that this gang of bandits was the remnants of the former New Fourth Army Gu Fusheng, with a number of about 70 or 80 people, owning more than ten rifles and three pistols, and usually appeared in the Huangbo Jiwang Temple area, causing great harm. However, because the area is under the jurisdiction of Qingpu County, it is necessary to wait for instructions from the highest security authority in this city before jointly going to search and suppress them.

### Fu Bo Case Compensation Issues: A Solution Has Been Negotiated

The families of the officers who died in the Fu Bo incident previously requested relief from the China Merchants Bureau and the issuance of compensation because of their difficult lives.

It is now learned that the Ministry of Communications has negotiated a solution with the Ministry of National Defense and will notify the families to go to Nanjing to personally explain the situation. The China Merchants Bureau will notify the families as soon as the official documents arrive in Shanghai.

### House Seized as National Property: Ma Jiayong Accuses Wu Rencang

Wu Rencang, Director of the Central Trust Bureau and Secretary-General of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee, was recently accused by Ma Jiayong, the owner of the Shanghai Peichang Iron Factory, of "infringing on private rights" based on a judgment example of the Administrative Court. Ma Jiayong purchased the base house at No. 1, Alley 84, Xiangde Road from Japanese Nishimura on October 2, 1943. The deed was Japanese Registration No. 1352 (originally American Registration No. 3920). After the victory, the house was allocated for military use. Ma recently applied to the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office for return. After investigation, the Japanese Registration deed number in the document submitted by him was 1307, which did not match the original number. Wu Rencang, Secretary-General of the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee, approved the rejection, and the house was confiscated as national property. Ma believes that the land was legally purchased and there is sufficient evidence to prove it, so he specially hired a lawyer to file a complaint against Wu Rencang, the legal representative of the committee, based on the judgment example of the Administrative Court. The case was heard yesterday by Zhao Yinglu, judge of the Civil Court of the District Court. After a long interrogation in court, the case was adjourned for retrial.

### Secretary General of the US Air Transport Team Admits to Misusing Public Property

[Report from Our Newspaper] Filipino Paimen, Secretary-General of the US Army Air Transport Team, took advantage of his position from April to June this year to privately issue export permits without the permission of his superiors, and transported 108 gallons of kerosene and wood to his home (No. 4, Alley 51, Gloschi Road). This was discovered by the team and sent to the City Police Bureau for transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

The kerosene has been used up, and there are still ten gallons left. The wood was used to repair his own kitchen. I filled out the export permit myself, because the Secretary-General has this power. After the interrogation, the court ordered him to be remanded.

### Suddenly a Violent Guest Arrived During a Banquet for Relatives and Friends: Gold Bracelet Snatched, Young Girl Shot

[Report from Our Newspaper] Feng Pu (25 years old), No. 108, Cihou Nanli, Hadong Road, specializes in wholesale cold noodles. Last night at about 8:00, he held a ghost festival ancestor worship and set up several tables for guests, and many relatives and friends arrived. Because the weather was hot, two tables were set up inside the house. Among the guests were nieces Pu Guidi and Pu Xinnv. Guidi is a dancer in a dance hall, with modern clothes and wearing two gold bracelets. While drinking and chatting, two bandits suddenly came, one wearing a xiangyun gauze shirt and trousers, and the other wearing a white shirt and trousers, both armed with guns. Seeing that Guidi was wearing gold bracelets, they pointed their guns at her chest and snatched the two bracelets. Her younger sister, Xinnv, screamed "robbery", which angered the bandits. They fired a shot, hitting her right neck and penetrating her left neck, and she fell to the ground. The bandits then fled with the stolen goods towards Fuxu Road, Zhongzheng Road. Upon receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Police Station immediately sent the injured person to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injury is serious and life-threatening.

### Investigation of Corruption and Extortion by Tax Officials; Millions Demanded; Direct Taxation Bureau Thoroughly Investigating Allegations Against Woodworking Industry

[Our Newspaper's Report] Song Yimin and Ding Shenxiu, auditors from the Direct Taxation Bureau, went to Jin Yuan Cotton Cloth Store at No. 3 Shunshou Lane, South Wuxi Road, on the morning of the day before yesterday to examine the store's accounts. They accused the store of operating an illegal money exchange and evading taxes, intending to take all of the store's account books back to the bureau for review. At that time, Ding Shenxiu interjected, urging the store to "be sensible," and also mentioned why the previously issued business registration certificate had not yet been processed. This, he said, was already a significant favor. Song then took the opportunity to extort a bribe of ten million yuan, while Ding mediated, and they finally agreed on five million yuan. Zhao Erkang, the assistant manager of the store, paid the bribe at that time and invited them to lunch. Fang Qingcai, the store's manager, happened to return from outside and witnessed this scene. Realizing it was extortion, he was furious and called the police, who arrested Song and took him to the police station. The other investigator, Ding Shenxiu, seeing the situation was unfavorable, managed to escape.

"Another Report" City Councilor Pan Gongzhan, at a meeting in Beijing the day before yesterday, criticized the extortion by tax officials from the City Direct Taxation Bureau. Yesterday, Lou Guowei, the director of the Direct Taxation Bureau, stated: On the afternoon of the 21st of this month, Yan Esheng, the secretary-general of the City Chamber of Commerce, had informed him that auditors targeting the Chinese-style woodworking industry were making "conditional demands" to three businesses and asked him to pay attention. Since it was already past office hours, an investigation was launched by the Supervision Office on the 22nd. Lou also said: Out of more than a thousand people in the entire bureau, it cannot be guaranteed that everyone is honest and self-disciplined. However, once any corrupt behavior is discovered, the bureau will hand the case over to the judicial authorities for legal action. As for the fourteen auditors (two for each business) who audited the account books of seven Chinese-style woodworking businesses, the bureau has already reconfirmed the original guarantees with the guarantors. If any illegal activities are discovered through investigation, they will be handled according to the law. When asked by the reporter when the senior officials sent by the Ministry of Finance would arrive in Shanghai, Lou replied that he had only seen it in the newspaper and the bureau had not yet received any notification. However, the bureau is currently conducting a thorough investigation and hopes that Chairman Zhang Zhongyuan of the woodworking industry will provide leads to facilitate the investigation. If such situations are discovered, they will be dealt with according to the law. Otherwise, the salaries of public servants are already so meager that they cannot withstand further stimulation.

### Main Culprit in Li Zao Kidnapping Case Arrested

Last year, in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, Shi Zhang, a woman from a prominent family in Li Zao, Pudong, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits, who demanded a large ransom. The 8th Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters managed to rescue the hostage on the spot and arrested four accomplices. However, the main culprits, Lin Pinyuan, Lin Sanmao, and Lin Shouzhis, fled in advance after hearing of the situation. At the beginning of this month, the brigade commander of the 8th Brigade received a tip that the three criminals had secretly returned to their hometown. So, on the 16th of this month, they went to the address in the 14th Bao of Nicheng Township, Pudong, and arrested the three criminals. According to the confessions of the criminals, in November of last year, they colluded with Gu Xiaogen, Bao Yinfa, Shen ChuanGen, Shen Chuanlin, and others to go to the Shi residence late at night. They forcibly dragged Shi Zhang out of her bed and onto a sailboat by the creek, sailing to Zhapu Port, and demanding a ransom of 50 million yuan. The three criminals are scheduled to be transferred to the District Court today for strict handling.

### Shop Apprentice Shows Sympathy and Helps with Student Aid; Hopes for Continued Response from All Sectors

Our newspaper's student aid fund received a total of 2.2 million yuan on the second day of fundraising yesterday. Reader Maozai donated 2 million yuan alone to the "Honor Team," making him the top donor in the past two days. His enthusiasm is truly touching.

Also, Yao Fugen, who lives on Xiaoshadu Road, sent a letter late last night stating: "I am a loyal reader of Shen Bao. My family was poor when I was young, and I dropped out of school after graduating from elementary school. I now work in a small cigarette paper shop, but I always feel the lack of knowledge and deeply resent the pain of dropping out of school in my childhood. Therefore, I deeply sympathize with your newspaper's initiative. I am now contributing my savings of 10,000 yuan to your newspaper's student aid fund. The amount is small, please don't laugh at it. However, there are many benefactors in Shanghai. I hope everyone will contribute money to help. I would be very honored." Although Mr. Yao is an apprentice, he is able to act righteously. Although his donation is only 10,000 yuan, it is quite commendable. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will actively donate to achieve the goal of 1 billion yuan as soon as possible. The donations received during the day yesterday are listed below:

8th Team: Zai Rong Honorary Team: 2 million yuan

9th Team: Wu Yantao Thanksgiving Liao & Hong Second Public Student Aid Team: 200,000 yuan

The above totals 2.2 million yuan, bringing the total collected so far to 3.6 million yuan.

### Police Bureau Telephone Number Painted on Official Cars; Police Station of the City God Temple Punished

### The Lost Golden Age of the Pengli Lake Route; Struggling On

[Special dispatch from Poyang, 20th] Poyang Lake is the only reservoir in Jiangxi Province, nurturing the Gan, Rao, Fu, Xin, and Xiu rivers, the five major trunks and tributaries. The Chang and Le rivers are located upstream of the Poyang Lake tributaries. The Chang River originates in Qimen, which borders Jingdezhen and Fuliang, while the Le River originates in Wuyuan, which borders Dexing. Each has a waterway of over 300 miles. The waters of the two rivers flow day and night, ceaselessly and turbulently. In the past, they made the greatest efforts for the lives of people along the rivers. In the past, they transported local products from Wuyuan, Dexing, Wannian, Qimen, Fuliang, and Poyang, loading ships full of goods in batches, and at the same time, they transported Chinese and foreign goods from Suzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jiujiang, loading ships full of goods in batches.

The most famous Jingdezhen porcelain, Leping Mingshan's manganese coal, Poyang's tobacco and grain, and even the foreign tea leaves of Qihong and green tea, which account for a large proportion of exports, all relied on its intake and output to connect the inside and outside, meeting the needs of trade and assisting the unparalleled prosperity of industry and commerce along the river for many years. Therefore, the tributaries of the Chang and Le rivers are the only lifeline of commercial specialties in the counties along the river. In this hinterland where there was no rail transportation in the past, the importance of inland navigation can be imagined.

Former Prosperity
Full Sails Competing

In terms of Poyang Lake shipping tools, just the category of civilian ships alone has as many as 60 types. There are approximately 100,000 large and small ships in the province's inland rivers, employing 500,000 boatmen. The most famous include Fu boats, Ba Dou boats, Crow Tail boats, Diao Zi boats, Full River Red boats, Evening Lotus boats, Crow Tip boats, Ji Tip boats, Rowing boats, Leping boats, and Duck Center boats. The shapes of the boats vary, the names are different, the load-bearing capacities are different, and the speeds are also different. In the early years of the Republic of China, there were more than 50,000 large and small ships on the Chang and Le rivers in Poyang Inner Lake, and the tributaries of Shangrao, Hekou, Yiyang, etc., sailing on the above-mentioned routes, supporting approximately 250,000 people who relied on the boat industry for a living.

At that time, the local products of the counties along the lake, such as black tea from Qimen, Fuliang, and Hekou, green tea from Wuyuan, Dexing, Yushan, and Yujiang, porcelain from Jingdezhen, lotus seeds and tobacco from Poyang, Indigo and coal from Leping, candy paper from Dexing, and miscellaneous grains from Wannian, Yugan, and other counties, were all transported through the Chang and Le Rivers to Poyang Lake and then transshipped to Jiujiang for export. Foreign goods from various counties also relied on these many civilian ships for continuous import. The volume of special products and commercial goods exported and imported throughout the year was astounding. Therefore, the civilian ship transport industry was the most prosperous period in adapting to the times.

The water freight rates for shipping goods by boats are slightly lower in spring and summer and double in autumn and winter. Boat owners soliciting cargo and the industry often has disputes. Accepting transportation and departing, both compete to shorten the time, rushing to reach the destination with rapid efforts; and quickly soliciting cargo and loading for return. At that time, the sails along the lake rivers were fully inflated, like dragon boats racing during the Dragon Boat Festival. The income of boat owners was abundant, and their lives were naturally more comfortable. Whenever they sailed through the waves, the shouts of the boatmen could be heard, and the pole supported them against the current, humming and pushing forward. Their spirit of peace of mind and professionalism could not help but make people envy the true joy of life on the water.

Having Gone Through the Sea
Pole Laborers Quit Their Jobs and Boats Sink

Since the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic of China [1929], the Red Disaster spread southward and the pole laborers quit their jobs and the boats sank to the north. Fang Shao's communist bandits rose up in eastern Jiangxi, invading Leping, Fuliang, Dexing, Wannian, and other counties, and traffic along the Poyang Lake river was blocked. Qimen and Wuyuan's boxed tea and Jingdezhen's porcelain were changed to land routes through Tunxi for export. The special products of other counties were also changed to other routes and methods, and most agricultural products declined due to the uneasiness of bandit disturbances. In order to avoid danger, merchants reduced their imports and mostly transported them by land. As a result, the civilian ship industry along the lake was in a desolate situation, with ships completely suspended and the lives of boat owners becoming increasingly difficult. Some sold their boats and changed their jobs, returning to their hometowns to farm; others sank their boats in the water, hoping to resume their business in the future; or broke their boats into firewood to show their determination to quit their jobs. During these years, occasionally passing by the lake and looking around, there were no boats tied up by the green willow banks; on the reed beaches, the sound of poles could not be heard. This special scene at this time truly made people feel overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and the present!

After the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934], the bandit disasters gradually subsided, and local commerce and industry gradually moved towards the path of restoration. No one could have imagined that while planning to restore, the sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge started the Anti-Japanese War, and the flames of war spread from North China to Southeast China. The Yangtze River waterway was once again blockaded. The inland river civilian ship industry had no freight transport and many corvée services. Civilian ships that had just resumed navigation like a flash in the pan fell into the state after the 18th year of the Republic of China. The opportunity for them to struggle given by the times was lost again. Undoubtedly, their lives and property suffered huge losses, just like the people in the occupied areas, and there was no way to recover. After the restoration in the past year, the power of the atomic bomb

Resuming Sailing Now
Just Making a Last Struggle

After the restoration in the past year, the power of the atomic bomb made the civilian ship industry, an outdated means of transportation that was about to die, revive again as if planted by the spring breeze. Clever merchants then abandoned the previous shortcuts of car transport and used the old routes of civilian ships to serve their cargo transport. In this year, although the original boat owners have gradually resumed sailing, they are not as spectacular as the past ship transport industry.

Speaking of today's shipping, Poyang is still the center of ship gatherings. Along the lake for several miles, boats are lined up and masts are like forests. Every day, civilian ships and steamships sail to various places, to Leping, to Nanchang, to Jiujiang, to Yingtan, to Hekou. In the early morning and evening, the sound of whistles echoes each other. There are still many people who leave here, and many people who meet here again. The emotions of sending off in the middle of the river, the gatherings of shaking hands and saying goodbye, meeting by chance, and being a guest in a foreign land. This situation is still reminiscent of the grand scene of that year.

Poyang is such a water terminal full of farewells and gatherings, with tons and tons of black coal, baskets of porcelain, boxes of tea, and bags of rice and miscellaneous grains gathered here from the production areas of northeastern Jiangxi. Then, coal carriers, steamships, Luo Tongs, Diao Zis, Fu boats, and various types of ships divide their routes to Nanchang, Jiujiang, and other places, and then cotton yarn, cloth, and imported goods are transported from Nanchang and Jiujiang to the rural hinterland of various counties. Between one export and one import, the price given by the goods naturally supports many boat owners and boatmen.

However, times have changed. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Southern Xun railways have been completed and opened to traffic one after another. The Beijing-Jiangxi Railway is now being proposed for restoration. In addition, the trunk and branch highways between Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi are also being repaired quickly. Sensitive merchants naturally abandon the backward means of transportation at this time and use the convenient and enhanced railways and highways as their cargo transportation tools. Although some inland areas that railways and highways do not reach still rely on civilian ships for loading, the remaining quantity must be very low. In general, smart boat owners know that their decline is approaching. Driven by food and clothing, at this time, they all hold the idea of "do one day as a monk and ring the bell for one day," temporarily maintaining their current lives and making a final struggle.

### Township Head Arrests Recruits; Fatal Incident in Rong City

[Dispatch from Fuzhou, 20th] With the start of conscription, unscrupulous township and baojia personnel have acted perversely, ignoring government laws and regulations, and regard this as an opportunity to make a fortune for themselves. It is reported that some people in neighboring counties are buying recruits in Fuzhou City at high prices, which will affect the conscription of volunteers in Fuzhou. It is learned that the city government has ordered strict prohibition. A case recently occurred here in which the arbitrary arrest of recruits led to a fatal incident. It turned out that Wang Shengxian, the township head of Qianyu Township, Linsen County, personally led township soldiers and without the cooperation of local bao police personnel in the urban area, rushed into the Minsheng Western Clothing Store in Zhongzhou, Rong City, claiming to be recruiting soldiers and wanting to arrest Guo Kuitie, the shop owner's nephew. Guo, seeing the situation, fled in a hurry and jumped into the Minjiang River, where he drowned, arousing public outrage among the local people. Guo is 27 years old this year, and is not subject to conscription according to the law. This matter has attracted the attention of the authorities and various sectors.

### Zhengzhou's "One-Dragon" Arrested in Bian for Drug Case; Slogans for "Down with Chen" and "Support Chen" Posted Throughout the City

[Dispatch from Zhengzhou, 20th] Chen Yaolong, chairman of the Zhengzhou General Labor Union, nicknamed "One-Dragon," is one of Zhengzhou's notables. He recently went to Bian, where he was secretly reported to have committed crimes such as drug abuse and drug trafficking, and was arrested by the Henan Provincial Government. Because Chen was also serving as the captain of the Zhengzhou Investigation Team, the case was handed over to the Zhengzhou Headquarters Command for handling, and Chen was also sent to Zhengzhou. All parties in Zhengzhou are paying attention to the case almost as much as they are paying attention to the communist bandit Liu Bocheng's southward flight. Because some who had been harmed by Chen in the past have risen up to launch a "Down with Chen" movement. Some who are currently being supported by Chen have risen up to launch a "Support Chen" movement. As a result, different slogans and leaflets are seen throughout the city. Chen was examined by the Health Institute today (20th) to see if he was addicted to drugs, and the results will be known within three days. However, other parts of the case, such as drug trafficking and whether he had served as a detective captain for the enemy puppets, will require a considerable period of investigation before a decision can be made.

### Zhejiang Provincial Government Hosts Reporters; Reports on the Current Stage of Banditry

[Dispatch from Hangzhou, 3rd] The banditry in Zhejiang Province has been exaggerated too much by various newspapers. The provincial government specially hosted reporters today, saying: All the bandit gangs in Siming, Kuocang, Kuaiji, Wencheng, and various border areas only number more than 2,000 people. Zhu Zhiguang's bandit force also has only over 100 people, so the 7,000 to 8,000 people reported in various newspapers are really mistaken. In Changhua and Yuqian counties on the border of Zhejiang and Anhui, communist bandits recently planned to attack Changhua County, and the situation was tense for a while, but fortunately they were repelled by our Zhejiang Protection Force.

### Fishing Disputes Occur Frequently in Shangyu and Shaoxing

[Central News Agency, 23rd] Fishermen from Shangyu and Shaoxing counties often have disputes due to conflicting interests. Although Commissioner Zheng Xiaoyin of the Third District Commissioner's Office personally handled the fishing area disputes in May of this year fairly and issued a ruling, announcing that both parties should abide by it, recently the fishermen of Shaoxing suddenly broke the agreement, prohibiting the fishermen of Shangyu from fishing in the area designated by Commissioner Zheng, and even hijacking the fishing boats of Shangyu and driving them to the central sandbar, taking photos forcibly, and accusing the fishermen of Shangyu of violating the ruling. A member of the county's fishermen's association suffered such illegal bullying and cannot remain silent. He has issued a statement on the incident and appealed to the people of Zhejiang and both Zhejiang provinces, requesting that justice be upheld.

### Changzhou City Council Unanimously Passes; Impeachment of the Director of the Education Bureau; Dispatches Telegrams to the Provincial and County Governments for Investigation and Handling

[Dispatch from Wujin, 22nd] On the fifth day of the meeting of the County Council of this county, in the Education Group case, councilors Zou Xingeng and Zhou Kuyu proposed an urgent motion: Education Bureau Director Xu Daxing's words and actions are absurd, his measures are arbitrary, and he is corrupt and derelict in his duties. He should be impeached. The motion was supported by 96 members. Jiang Chun also made a temporary motion: "Education Bureau Director Xu Daxing disregarded the inspection report and transferred a large number of principals for no reason." The reason for supplementing the impeachment was presented to the meeting. Jiang Xingyan and others also made similar temporary motions. The three cases were discussed together, and the entire meeting unanimously passed the motions: separate letters and telegrams were sent to the provincial departments and county government to dismiss him from his post and investigate and handle the matter.

### People Gone, Building Empty, How to Execute? Xinyu Grain Official Sentenced to Seventeen Years

[Dispatch from Nanchang, 18th] Tan Ruwen, the former section chief of the Xinyu County Farmland and Grain Management Office, abused his authority while in office, engaging in corruption and dereliction of duty. He was reported and a total of five cases were filed against him. The district court concluded four cases, and he was sentenced to a total of nine years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for nine years. While serving his sentence in prison, he took the opportunity to escape while being temporarily released from prison to be interrogated in the fifth case. Now the fifth case has also been concluded, and he has been sentenced to another eight years in prison and deprived of his civil rights for eight years for directly profiting from the affairs under his management. Together with the previous sentences, he should serve a total of seventeen years in prison, but with "people gone and the building empty," how to execute the sentence is truly an interesting story.

### One of the Four Great Rice Markets: Wuxi's Unprecedented Prosperity; Rice Boats Concentrated at Shuanghekou, Stem to Stern; Every Warehouse Piled High with Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains

[Wuxi, 20th Dispatch] Wuxi is renowned throughout the nation as a land of fish and rice. For thousands of years, residents of both urban and rural areas have enjoyed abundant food and clothing, with collective disturbances rarely occurring. Unfortunately, on the fifth day of the fifth month of this year, because the price of rice suddenly soared from 80,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) to over 200,000 yuan within three days, many rice shops refused to sell rice, triggering a rice-grabbing frenzy. Although the police authorities dispatched officers to suppress it, the tide of anger could not be stopped in time. In less than half a day, the grabbing spread to both inside and outside the city. It was not until the garrison troops assisted in implementing martial law late at night that the serious situation was quelled. The total loss was estimated to be over five to six thousand shi.

Recently, although the price of rice has risen from over 200,000 yuan to over 400,000 yuan per shi, this should be attributed to the effective measures taken by the county government. Social order is very peaceful. In the past month, rice and grains from various places have poured in like a tide. Dozens of warehouses throughout the county are piled high with rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, making it impossible for latecomers to find space. In the river channel from Sanli Bridge to Shuanghekou outside Wu Bridge, rice boats are connected stem to stern, without the slightest gap. At its peak, there were over 5,000 boats docked. The sources of these rice boats range from nearby neighboring counties to places as far as Hunan and Sichuan. Because the price of rice is cheap in those areas, they travel thousands of miles to Wuxi to sell it, thus creating an unprecedented prosperity not seen in hundreds of years.

Judging from the recent prosperity of the Wuxi rice market, it seems that a detailed investigation and statistics of the rice shortage in various places is still necessary. If the authorities can thoroughly study the production and sales of rice throughout the country and make reasonable adjustments and circulation, I believe the rice shortage can definitely be reduced in severity.

The coal mined will be used, with 80% supplied to various places in Beijing and Shanghai, and the remainder used by the company's own coal factory.

### Leaders of All Circles in Shanghai Discussed Yesterday at Tea Party: Problem of Scholarships for Poor Students; Target of 5 Billion, Full Amount Recognized Immediately

[Our Paper] Leaders of all circles in this city, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Xuan Tiewu, Yan Zhuang, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilu, Wu Kaixian, Wu Shaoshu, Gu Yuxiu, Zhu Jingnong, and others, in order to assist poor students in schools at all levels in this city, to hold scholarships, specially named Dong to please enthusiastic people from all walks of life, on the afternoon of yesterday Four o'clock, held a tea party on the 14th floor of the International Hotel to discuss the problem of raising scholarships for poor students. More than eighty guests arrived, including Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yun Chu, Liu Gongyun, Mei Lanfang, Wang Yunsheng, Cheng Zhongxing, Wang Zhuyi, and university presidents Zhang Yi, O Yuanhuai, Dai Cuilun, and others. Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, happened to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning and was also invited to participate.

Worried About High Tuition Fees

First, Mayor Wu, the chairman, made a speech, explaining that the schools will soon begin, and students in universities, middle and primary schools are worried about the high tuition fees, especially the poor students. In view of the recent voluntary fundraising and charity sales by students from various schools, it is enough to prove the plight of the students. It is not only dangerous for them to buy on the streets, but also affects social order. We should try to help the next generation of students to study with peace of mind. I have made preliminary consultations with all parties, and the city will organize a unified student assistance agency to coordinate the work. All donation agencies can still retain their names, so that it is easy to raise public support and fairness. Those who agree with this principle of donation can participate in the supervision of this agency. The detailed method will be discussed later. Wu Kaixian then rose to say: This time, students who receive scholarships should know the source of the donations, and those with excellent grades will continue to be awarded scholarships in the future. At the same time, donors can designate students to study specialized academics, and guarantee their careers after graduation. Excellent award-winning students will surely be able to study with peace of mind. Lu Ganchen, based on the experience of the Youth Association in handling scholarships over the years, believes that scholarships should be widespread and suggested that school principals and relevant forces study and implement good methods.

Expand Fundraising and Proceed Regularly

Cheng Zhongxing was invited to speak and explained that the News has been donating scholarships for a long time. He believes that personal wealth is taken from society and should also be contributed to society, expand fundraising, and should proceed regularly. Wang Yunsheng said in his speech that the country should pay attention to national education. The education budget is too small, and the planned six-year compulsory education has not yet been implemented and cannot be compared with Japan. General MacArthur is now ordering Japan to conduct another three years of compulsory education. Since the war, college students in our country have been supplied with public funds, forming a partial state. From the next issue, the public funding for universities will be cancelled, and it is necessary to raise scholarships. After the university burden is rationalized, its funding should be used to enrich national education, and it is hoped that it will be implemented next year. At this point, Vice Minister Hang declared that the Ministry of Education is currently planning to strive for 15% of the education budget in accordance with the Constitution and will strive to enrich national education in the future. The Far East Basic Education Conference held in Beijing on September 1 is enough to prove the importance of national education? Hang suggested that schools increase the service opportunities for students to work part-time and study part-time to reduce the number of young people out of school. Finally, he expressed his gratitude to all walks of life in Shanghai for their enthusiastic assistance to poor students.

Tremendous Benefit from Assisting Scholarships

Subsequently, Pan Gongzhan spoke, saying that school fees are too high, not only poor students cannot afford it, but also the parents of ordinary students feel the difficulty of their children's tuition fees. If a solution is not sought quickly, it may cause student unrest in the future. The financial resources of the government and local governments are also difficult. Now, society is helping scholarships, and students benefit greatly. After measurement, Zhang Yi, President of Fudan University, represented the universities and expressed his thanks to all sectors of society for their kindness.

Zhang also suggested two points: (1) Narrow scholarships, give special bonuses to students with special academic and moral excellence, (2) Broad scholarships, today's social and economic situation is not good, and ordinary students are unable to study, and those whose academic and moral behavior are above the standard should be generally rewarded. The two can be parallel without contradiction. Jun also had many specific suggestions for the organization of scholarship institutions and methods, which will be left to be decided at a meeting next week. The tea party was successfully concluded at about 7 o'clock.

In addition: Mayor Wu announced at the tea party that the goal of raising scholarships this time is 5 billion yuan, and all parties immediately recognized the full amount on the spot, and decided to continue fundraising, and Mayor Wu will convene all parties next week to organize fundraising institutions to discuss the way forward. The amount of recognition donated by all parties yesterday is as follows: Shanghai Stock Exchange 1 billion yuan, Industrial and Commercial Bank 300 million yuan, City Bank 200 million yuan, Municipal Government 500 million yuan, Students writing election tickets 500 million yuan, Shen Bao 300 million yuan, News 500 million yuan, Youth Association 700 million yuan, Youth League 250 million yuan, Anonymous 250 million yuan, Mei Lanfang Zhou Xinfang invited famous artists to perform charity shows, raising 500 million yuan, the amount recognized by Ta Kung Pao is pending.

When Hang met with reporters, he made a speech on the tuition fees of private universities, middle and primary schools in this city for the next semester, saying: "From the position of the Ministry of Education, I hope that the tuition fees of private schools at all levels will be as low as possible, so as to prevent most poor students from dropping out of school, and I hope that the economic administration of the schools will be made public."

### Review of Imported Cotton Purchases Completed, China Trust Sets Up Spinning Method, First Batch of 19,144 Bales Purchased

[Report from our newspaper] The China Trust Bureau has completed the review of the application for the purchase of imported cotton. The China Trust Bureau, the Textile Adjustment Committee, the China Textile Construction Company, and other relevant agencies have discussed the issues of spinning and sales of this imported cotton several times and have formulated the following methods:

(A) Regarding the purchase part (1) For the imported cotton purchased by our association, if the applicant is a yarn factory, it will be handed over to the applicant yarn factory for acceptance. In addition to signing a spinning contract with the factory and handing over the cotton for spinning to the factory for storage, the remaining cotton that is unwilling to spin (no more than 50%) shall be issued by the factory with a warehouse receipt in the name of our bureau, so that it can be combined with the imported cotton purchased from non-yarn factory applicants. In addition to appropriately allocating a part of it to the yarn factories that applied for spinning to the Six District Association before July 31, the rest will be handed over to the China Textile Construction Company for acceptance and spinning.

(2) It is proposed that the purchased imported cotton be inspected and accepted by the buyer together with the spinning factory and the public brokerage house. After weighing, payment will be made based on the quantity and quality of the code list. If foreign manufacturers and banks do not allow payment after weighing and acceptance, the CIF Shanghai price will be paid first, and the interest, insurance, and bank handling fees for deferred payment will be paid after the cotton is officially accepted and verified. The foreign exchange and bank handling fees that have been paid for insurance ( % ) shall be paid in legal currency at the official price.

(3) If the CIF Shanghai price is paid first, the yarn factory applying for the purchase of cotton shall convert the cotton yarn according to the quantity of cotton purchased and hand it over to the China Trust Bureau. If any damage or shortage is found during acceptance, the yarn factory shall contact for claims settlement by itself. The quantity of cotton yarn to be paid shall not be reduced. When a non-yarn factory applies, a bank guarantee statement must be prepared, stating that if there is a shortage in acceptance, it guarantees to return the foreign exchange within five days with the notarization certificate of the public notary, and all claims shall be borne by the applicant.

(4) After the China Trust Bureau signs a purchase and sale contract with the applicant, it will request the Central Bank to remit the price abroad to the payee with the bank guarantee. The applicant does not need to issue separate invoices or receipts.

(5) The imported cotton purchased by our association shall be sent to the Transportation Management Committee to issue a permit with the simplest procedure to declare and pick up the goods.

(6) After the imported cotton purchased by our association is paid for and purchased, it shall be insured by the spinning factory (including the processing fee).

(7) The first batch of applications has been reviewed and approved for purchase in 24 cases, totaling 19.144 bales of cotton. For the six cases that do not fully comply with the original date, a signed report will be submitted to the President for approval before purchasing.

### Yarn to be Delivered by Spinning Factories in One Month

(B) Regarding the spinning and export part (1) Each spinning factory shall deliver the yarn within one month after acceptance and send the delivery schedule and bill of lading to the China Trust Bureau first. (Shenxin is allowed to deliver all the goods within one and a half months due to the large quantity. The China Textile Construction Company will deliver the existing yarn for the imported cotton it sells, and the delivery period for other spinning will be negotiated separately).

(2) When the bill of lading is sent to the China Trust Bureau, the approved processing fee shall be paid to the spinning factory in full.

(3) The spinning cotton yarn shall be negotiated according to the cotton procedure. The number of cotton yarn to be handed over shall be based on the principle of exchanging the same amount of foreign exchange in order to facilitate the spinning factory to deliver the goods quickly.

(4) The cotton yarn delivered by each spinning factory shall be inspected and accepted by the China Textile Construction Company. The China Textile Construction Company shall contact the export of the cotton yarn spun by the China Textile Construction Company itself and negotiate and decide with the China Trust Bureau. However, the spinning factory may also contact the export first, and finally consult with the China Textile Construction Company and the China Trust Bureau.

(5) The processing fee and round-trip freight required for spinning in yarn factories in other places shall not exceed the processing fee of yarn factories in this city in principle.

(6) The processing fee proposed by the China Textile Construction Company for 20-count yarn is 2,418,846,26 yuan (including 500,000 yuan for losses in the Northeast), and the processing fee proposed by the Association for 20-count yarn is 2,729,025,29 yuan, plus 10% profit. The Association believes that the proposed figure cannot be reduced any further. The China Textile Construction Company believes that the Association's figure is very reasonable and lower than that set by the Textile Adjustment Committee. It was decided to sign and submit it to the President for approval.

### Since Six Months This Year, Foreign Rice Has Been Continuously Shipped to China, Another 6,000 Tons Shipped from Myanmar Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The foreign rice ordered by the China Trust Bureau from Myanmar and Siam is still being shipped in succession. Yesterday, another 6,000 tons were shipped from Myanmar by the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Chen ship, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai in about ten days. According to the person in charge of the purchasing department of the bureau: In the past month, a total of 21,000 tons of foreign rice were shipped from Myanmar.

According to relevant sources, the total quota allocated to our country in the second half of this year can reach 287,000 tons. The person in charge also said: The number of foreign rice is considerable. If it can arrive successively, the supply of rice will be greatly enriched.

Rice Prices Rise and Fall

Yesterday, more than 3,000 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets, and the market conditions rose and fell. High-quality indica rice was average, and medium- and low-quality rice had no buyers, falling back by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. High-quality japonica rice was popular, showing a slight upward trend, medium- and low-quality rice was average, and early thin rice was actively digested, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan remained strong. Flour varied, and foreign flour was sold by the China Trust Bureau to the whole city.

### Bituminous Coal Consumption Increases Frequently

Since the price of coking coal has risen, people's hearts have been extremely stable. The cost of bituminous coal has also been high, and the number of arrivals in later batches has gradually decreased. Driven by actual sales, the consumption has increased frequently, and the market has slowly risen. Although the upward trend of white coal blocks is still constrained by coking coal, the market is quite popular due to the thin arrivals and inventory. Due to the high price of white coal chips, the main raw material of coal balls, all factories have adjusted the wholesale factory price from yesterday. The factory price of large factories is 860,000 yuan per ton, the factory price of small factories is 820,000 yuan, and the retail price is 50,000 yuan per dan.

Timber Market

Because the production cost of fir wood is 1,900 yuan, plus water freight, it will lose money according to the Shanghai market price, so most sellers sell it. Occasionally, there are those who seek cash, but the minimum is 2,350 yuan, and foreign pine is still stable.

Tea Market is Quiet

Yesterday, the foreign merchant tea market was still sluggish, and the market was quiet. According to people in the industry, since the official opening of Qimen new black tea by Jardine Matheson a few days ago, there are still seekers at the moment, but they dislike the price being too high, so the transaction has stopped again. However, it is heard that if the price is around 2 million yuan per dan, sales may continue. The minds of the shops in the local area and the merchants from other places are average for various domestic sales teas.

Cigarettes Increase

Yesterday's cigarette market was very rare for resale in the market. The local office was healthy, and the chips were thin. The market continued to rise. Changhou ten-pack British cigarettes rose to 22.42 million yuan, a further increase of 370,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The other strip cigarettes from Chinese manufacturers also saw an increase, and the price of American strip cigarettes also rose due to the lack of arrivals.

### Taiwan Tea and Camphor Exports are Active

Article 35: 'The import and export of all foreign currency securities are prohibited without the permission of the Ministry of Finance.' If the amount of banknotes carried by the above-mentioned passengers exceeds US$100 or its equivalent value, the excess amount shall be handled in accordance with the current regulations."

### Rumors Spread, Interest Rate Low, Chinese Stocks Turned Down After Popularity

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were bought by major players who were matched off-market. The interest rate opened low at 6 points and 1 point 05, and the buying interest was relatively revived. Therefore, rumors in the industry still focused on reducing the margin requirement for delivering securities from 50% to 30%. It is said that there is great confidence. There are also various other speculations, and outsiders have also heard many rumors about the currency system, but the younger generation has pressure at the top, and the market turned down after popularity.

The market opened steadily in the morning. After the opening, No. 26 and others entered the current Yongsheng yarn, and No. 35 and others entered the delivered Yongsheng yarn, once approaching 220 yuan. No. 218 and others came to sell, once falling to 216 yuan. No. 116 and others entered Shangwei stocks, rising to 220 yuan. After the supply of No. 180 and others, it fell back to 217 yuan. No. 16 and others came to enter, and the interest rate off-market opened low at 6 points and 1 point 05, and some opened low at 4 points and 9 points, and people's hearts were boosted. The tug-of-war situation for an hour and a half was finally broken. The delivered Yongsheng yarn rose to 222 yuan, and No. 226 and No. 119 frantically bought the current Yongsheng yarn. No. 15 and others sold at high prices, and police officers came to dismantle the intercom telephone off-market, falling back to 217 yuan. No. 23 and others still accepted the current Yongsheng yarn, and No. 135 and others also entered the delivered Yongsheng yarn, rising to the high prices of 221 yuan and 223 yuan. After being suppressed by Yang of the younger generation, entrusted to No. 158 and No. 45, it began to fall back slightly. No. 130 sold the current Yongsheng yarn, and No. 110 and others also settled the delivered Yongsheng yarn, falling again to 217 yuan near noon. With the strong support of No. 223, the morning closed with the current Yongsheng yarn ending at the prices of 217 yuan and 220 yuan.

After the close, No. 218 and others had supplies, and the asking price was slightly lower. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the spot stocks increased by about half a percent for Yongsheng, Xinyi, and Zhongfa, and Xin Guang, Meiya, Yonggong, and Jingfu rose slightly. Qinxing and Xinhua remained stable, Datong fell slightly, and Li'an, Jinglun, and Shangwu rose by half a percent. Neiyi and Xinya were also stable, and the remaining stocks all rose slightly. The delivered stocks increased slightly for Yongsheng, Xinyi, Meiya, Jingfu, and Xin Guang, and the off-market Gu Lao stocks were stable.

### US Exchange Rate Unchanged, British Exchange Rate Reduced

[Report from our newspaper] The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee approved the benchmark price of the US exchange rate yesterday, which remained at the original price of 38,500 yuan. However, the benchmark price of the pound sterling was extended to 120,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,200 yuan compared with the previous price. It is reported that the Stabilization Committee, in view of the current disjunction between the US and British exchange rates, the fixed US and British exchange rates are no longer necessary. In the future, the actual situation will be considered and adjusted at any time. According to the benchmark price of the pound sterling yesterday, the US-British arbitrage rate is only about US$3.117 per pound sterling.

Designated Banks Appropriately Reduce the Difference

In addition, the outside world believes that the difference between the buying and selling prices of the British exchange rate of designated banks is 2,000 yuan from a certain standard price, which is considered to be too expensive. The United Association of Designated Banks held a meeting on the 22nd and agreed that from the 25th, the market price of buying and selling British exchange rates would be 1,500 yuan different from the benchmark price, a reduction of 500 yuan compared with this week.

However, scattered retail investors sold at high prices in the middle, and the price slightly fell back. As a result, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn still rose by 550,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to 17.6 million yuan.

The cloth market was popular yesterday, and the market rose. In particular, Biji from the China Textile Construction Company has not yet been sold, and the asking price is even more popular. As a result, the price of Sijunzi Jin Yin Yuan Biji rose by 10,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to 493,000 yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose to 460,000 yuan, an increase of 30,000 yuan.

There were many buyers. 20-count extra fine cloth was 340,000 yuan, and only manufacturers could apply for it.

Sparse Spot Cotton Transactions

Spring and Autumn

### Collected Essays of Thomas Mann

— Zhao Jingshen

The great German writer Thomas Mann occupies a special place in our culture. His reputation is vast, but those who have read his great works still do not fully understand his thinking. This is worth our attention.

If we affirm that the two greatest living literary figures are Bernard Shaw and Thomas Mann, no one would be surprised. However, Shaw often mixes in mockery, while Thomas Mann does not. Thomas Mann is quite like the French Corneille or the English Ben Jonson. He has also recently written political essays, which adds another layer of glory to his reputation.

Now his "Essays of Three Decades" has been translated into English by H.T. Lowe-Porter. This collection of essays can answer the question: on which side does Mann stand? We might answer: on the one hand, he promotes the gospel of reason, opposing the irrationality of Fascism; on the other hand, he is an opponent of Western culture, so he seems to be standing on the side of irrationality himself. In fact, Mann is a multifaceted person whose thought has gradually developed. In his youth, he felt that the Western intellectual class was too rational. Later, when the irrational tide of Fascism swept through Europe, Mann immediately and clearly sided with the defense of reason. But Mann is still Mann. Except for rare moments of political passion, he feels that modern liberal psychology is superficial and lacks religious and tragic depth. Mann believes that liberals should learn from Schopenhauer, Wagner, and Nietzsche.

Later, Mann liberated himself from Orientalism and nationalism, as can be seen in his "Order of the Day," published in the United States five years ago. This is political liberation. As for philosophical liberation, it is found in the current "Essays of Three Decades." Goethe is Mann's lifeline, and Freud throws him a life raft. Goethe successfully reconciled wisdom and instinct, light and darkness. Freud showed that reason can bravely face irrationality and even directly explore its depths. Mann is not like optimistic liberals, but faces "death." However, unlike the irrationality of the decadent, he does not desire death. He believes that death can be overcome by love, while reason cannot overcome death. Mann is probably more profound in his understanding of modern writers who affirm life; and of modern writers who have profound insights, Mann is probably the most beautifully affirmative of life.

It seems only half right to say that Mann turned to democracy, or that he belongs to the German bourgeoisie or the Romantics. He himself knows that the latter still lives in him, but the latter is contained within the former. We know a lot about Mann as a "symbol of democracy," but we don't yet know about Mann as "reactionary."

"Essays of Three Decades" is a more satisfying book than "Order of the Day." To be honest, Mann is not a political commentator. He cannot pretend to be a social prophet. He is a poet, and his inner self is a harmonizer of nature and spirit. Reading his short essays on Storm, Fontane, or Chamisso always feels more nourishing than reading his appeal to the German people.

Unfortunately, this recent book does not include all of Mann's non-political essays. It does not include any essays written after the outbreak of World War II in 1939, nor does it include the best essays from "Past Masters," published in 1933, nor does it include "Freud's Position in the History of Modern Thought." Nevertheless, it is still a rich book, fully expressing the topics discussed and Mann's interests and insights. His essays are extremely profound and broad, neither purely personal nor strictly objective. The three best articles are: "Goethe and Tolstoy," "Wagner's Suffering and Greatness," and "Schopenhauer." To understand Thomas Mann's thought, one should also read these three.

This is a good book. The reviewer may find it difficult to discern his precise thinking. Now, let's write down Thomas Mann's views on writing as a conclusion.

A writer should have brains. Mann said: "A completely stupid poet often dreams of romantic nature worship." But brains alone are not enough, and even adding innate creative genius is not enough. Mann said that two more elements are needed: culture and tradition. In Europe and America, every writer with brains, whose work becomes a bestseller, can become a celebrity and live comfortably for the rest of his life. Whenever a new book is published, book clubs introduce his book, and he can earn a large income. Mann believes that he should still work quietly and gradually, regardless of his living environment, and not be carried away by joy.

Regarding the practice of another group of writers, Mann believes that they should enthusiastically study the work of the masters and warmly accept the cultural heritage. Even the greatest writers are lifelong apprentices. Thomas Mann's humility is truly worthy of pride. In one essay, he often refers to himself as a student of Wagner. In another essay discussing Goethe's greatness, he said: "We modern people are merely conductors of fire." Shouldn't we writers learn this kind of humility? But how few such people there are!

The above is all from Eric Bentley's review. According to the "Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature," p. 510, Thomas Mann lived in Switzerland after 1933, where he ran a publication called "Mass und Wert" (1937). After he came to the United States in 1938, he published two more political essays, "The Coming Victory of Democracy" and "This Peace." Thomas Mann also wrote a four-volume epic novel, which includes: (1) "Die Geschichten Jakobs, 1933" (The Stories of Jacob), (2) "Der junge Joseph, 1935" (Young Joseph), (3) "Joseph in Aegypten, 1936" (Joseph in Egypt), (4) "Joseph, der Ernährer, 1944" (Joseph the Provider). In addition, he also wrote "Lotte in Weimar, 1940" and the novella "Die vertauschten Köpfe, 1940" (The Transposed Heads).

### The Personality of the Painter

— Shi Liangfu

Before the Eastern Jin Dynasty of the Six Dynasties, our country's painting thought had not yet become a system. In fragmentary painting theories, all painters respected the word "personality" as the soul of painting. In ancient times, there was a distinction between artisan painters and artist painters, and personality was the dividing line. Wang Xizhi's "Treatise on Painting" first mentioned the issue of the painter's personality. He believed that the elegance or vulgarity of a work depended entirely on the elegance or vulgarity of the individual's personality.

Indeed, many historical facts, ancient and modern, prove that this is an irrefutable truth.

Everyone knows that Chinese painting takes "Qi Yun Sheng Dong" (spiritual consonance and lifelike quality) as the standard for evaluation. Qi Yun Sheng Dong is not only expressed in the external brushstrokes, but also originates from the internal identity and personality. The internal and external mutually cause each other, and the Qi Yun naturally flows out.

Turning through painting theories, it is rare not to talk about "personality." The following three quotes can show one aspect of this:

Shen Zongqian said: "Although the brush and ink come from the hand, they are rooted in the heart. How can one have a transcendent style with meanness in one's heart? How can one have a serene spirit if one's self-esteem is not released?"

Zhang Pushan said: "Da Chi (Huang Gongwang) was frank and unrestrained, so his paintings are plain and serene... Ni Yunlin (Ni Zan) was completely aloof from the world, so his paintings are remote and detached. If Wang Shuming (Wang Meng) inevitably coveted glory and attached himself to power, his paintings are close to impetuous. Zhao Wenmin (Zhao Mengfu) did not cherish his integrity, so his calligraphy and paintings are both charming and vulgar."

Wen Zhengming said: "If a person's character is not high, their use of ink is without method. Then one knows that putting a dot of ink on paper is not easy. One must have nothing in one's heart, and then the misty clouds and beautiful scenery and the life-giving energy of heaven and earth will naturally gather under the brush, creating wonders. If one is preoccupied with worldly thoughts and has not washed away one's impurities, even if one faces hills and valleys every day and imitates masterpieces every day, in the end, one will only compete with the artisans of lacquer and plaster for skill in minute details."

Here's another example:

There is such a record in "Hua Yan": "Plum Blossom Taoist Wu Zhonggui (Wu Zhen) originally lived next door to Sheng Zizhao. People from all directions sought Sheng Zizhao's paintings with gold and silk, but Zhonggui's door was deserted, and his wife and children laughed at him. Zhonggui said: 'It won't be like this in twenty years.' As expected, it was as he said. Although Sheng was skilled, he had conventional brushwork and a limited scope, unlike Zhonggui, who was rough and unconstrained and had the style of a recluse. Is this not what is meant by Qi Yun?'" The reason for Sheng Zizhao's decline was that he sought profit like a merchant. Over time, although his works were skilled, a merchant atmosphere had covered his psychological perception and his paintings. Even if they were called exquisite, they were no longer precious.

In the pile of books, criticisms, judgments, and historical facts like these are too numerous to mention if you seek them out carefully. This shows how much ancient painters valued the cultivation of their character.

In contrast, what about the current Chinese painting scene? In recent years, due to continuous warfare, under the economic distress of the entire country, everyone has been exhausted in their efforts to make a living. Officials and civilians in and out of the government have no time to take care of "cultivating virtue." Painters engaged in artistic activities are no exception, and they do not pay much attention to the "doctrine" that "if a person's character is not high, their use of ink is without method." Therefore, today's Sheng Zizhaos are simply abundant, everywhere! Not only that, but there are also many painters who are not interested in painting, but use painting as a bridge to run around the doors of powerful people, seeking profit and fame. Compared with Zizhao, they are even worse!

As for the style of painters like Wu Zhonggui and Zhu Da Shi Tao, who in Shanghai doesn't laugh at them like Ah Q?

Of course, I do not advocate that painters should be isolated from society, nor can I say that painters can be hungry. However, the prevalence of the trend of treating painting as a commodity and putting profit first is, after all, a serious crisis for the future of Chinese painting. I ask the wise, do you agree?

### Xi Zi Zhuang Man - Autumn Sentiments

— Xu Bangda

Autumn enters the withering plane tree, cicada chirps turn sharp, secretly reflecting on Xi Shi's beautiful eyebrows, the jade rope low in the night, how long. Leaning on the dangerous building, the phoenix flute plays a plaintive tune. (Rhymes with "Ye") The blue sky has been ancient, and the blue sea has been deep and obstructed year after year; considering the human world, cut off the Hui Wen Suzhou brocade, lightly leaving sorrow to gather. At the long pavilion road, having broken all the soft branches, it also understands having no sentiment; even more can endure the falling Chu minister's heart; giving the ascending, broken clouds and drizzling rain, Wen Jun slowly dances, how to divide towards the river maples and mournful drums, only the cold tide rushes urgently, the distant shore is deep and silent.

### A Self-Taught Young Artist

— Wen Zhaotong

Zhou Dongguang is my young friend. He has walked the arduous path of self-study for five or six years, and has made considerable efforts. Today, it can be said that he has taken the first step on the road to success.

In the first spring after the start of the Pacific War, Yide was going to the interior. On the night before his departure, he said to me: "Zhou Dongguang, a primary school teacher in Nanxiang, is a young friend who has a passion for painting. I hope you can give him more guidance in the future."

It turned out that Dongguang was a friend who used his bicycle to travel from Nanxiang to Yide's studio every day when the Nite Studio recruited summer students in the 29th year (?). After the summer vacation, he still brought his works to Shanghai every Sunday to ask Yide for advice. Although he teaches at a primary school in Nanxiang, he spends all his time and energy on painting research in addition to teaching. He has no "models," only the fields of the countryside; he has no oil paints and easels, only some simple watercolor painting equipment. But he is not discouraged. On the contrary, under heavy work and material difficulties, he has indeed received rewards. These rewards are the dozens of watercolor paintings publicly exhibited in the Da Xin Gallery a few days ago.

Dongguang once discovered the weakness of his own drawing foundation and often discussed with me about going to art school. However, in this day and age, what power does a primary school teacher in a rural area have to afford the cost of art school? Fortunately, Yongsen agreed to my request and accepted Dongguang as a free student at the Shanghai branch of Suzhou Art College. Finally, he completed the preliminary course under the condition of working and studying. Although this is the function of school education, in Dongguang, I only think that this is still a well-deserved achievement of his self-study. Don't believe me, there are quite a few art school graduates, but according to what I know, the number of people who can achieve the same meager achievements as Dongguang is not very large, let alone that Dongguang is still a poor student?

Yaoqun took a look and suddenly understood, everything was clear in her heart, so she remained calm and asked Little Tiger; "Why did you run to the station too?"

"Look, Aunt Ji," Little Tiger blinked his big round eyes; "If I didn't come, your bag of money would be gone. I saw that guy behind you, so I grabbed him and snatched the bag back. See?" Little Tiger raised the money bag; thinking that his fabricated story had no loopholes.

"This won't work, Tiger brother!" Yaoqun tightened her face: "No matter what, I can't take you. Let's go, let's go back; I'm not going anymore."

"Mom already promised me!" Little Tiger, seeing that his wonderful "deceiving the heavens" plan was seen through by Yaoqun, had to use the old trick of being a rascal; "I'm not going back!... You go back, I won't go back either. I've been to Beiping, I'll go find Uncle Zhang..." Saying that, he grabbed his little baggage and prepared to buy a ticket.

Yaoqun had no choice but to coax and deceive, promising to go back to the fort to discuss; "Even if you want to go, it's not so easy, you still have to get a 'permit' and go through customs procedures..." Only then did she trick Little Tiger out of the station. The two were just about to hire a car when someone from the inn came chasing after them, saying that Long Fifth Master and Little Tiger's mother had both come to the city, and they had really agreed to let Little Tiger go to Beiping with Yaoqun.

"This child is really fond of you," Little Tiger's mother blessed Yaoqun twice; "You just fulfill his wish; let him go out and gain some experience. Anyway, this child is quite clever and has some skills. You really need a child like this to run errands for you, or something... Who told you to be so fond of him all the time?"

This was a few weeks ago.

Even Yaoqun didn't expect to be back so soon; even more unexpectedly, the situation in Shenyang had changed again, becoming so fast and so much more serious; so on the way back to the old fort, she had to be even more careful.

As soon as they arrived at the fourth station, Yaoqun dismissed the car, returned to the city overnight, hurriedly changed clothes with Little Tiger, took the horse whip, and each rode a horse, chasing the wind and chasing the electricity, and galloped away.

At this time, if you happened to be wandering in this mountain area, by the afterglow of a waning moon, you could see two inferior horses on a winding path at the bottom of the valley, shape and shadow together, like two small clumps of black clouds being swept by a whirlwind, chasing each other one after another. If you get closer and take a look, you will feel as if you are in the era of knights, with a close-up shot of heroic swordsmen galloping on angry horses for the injustices of the world. At this time, Yao Hua and Little Tiger, following the night-walking rules of the fort, were wearing wind hoods on their heads, capes on their shoulders, all in dark blue; with a German-style ten-shot pistol on one side of their waist, and a real-bullet rifle on the saddle. Coincidentally, most of the horses in the old fort were improved breeds of Mongolian and Japanese horses, mostly dark brown and jujube color, so even the people and horses were like a clump of dark clouds in the moonlight.

In principle, the old fort has arrangements on all routes, and travel should be safe. Why must they be so fully armed and make it so hot, as if facing a great enemy? It is not known that as soon as you leave the city and highways in the Northeast, you have returned to the fifteenth century from the twentieth century. Except for large groups, plus armed escorts, it is really not easy to walk. Those half-breeds, red beards, unfilial bandits, poisoned Koreans, Japanese ronin, and nominal detectives are all unscrupulous robbers. Especially on these small paths in the deep mountains, valleys, forests, and deserts, everyone is in danger of being attacked suddenly; so armed security has become necessary.

### Starting with Dancers

— Haike

Should dancers go to the kitchen or be nurses? I say the dancers should speak for themselves.

If dancers can be given better training, they may have outstanding talents; and dancers who are willing to endure hardship and want to be people are not without hope.

Before the war, I saw a drama written and directed by the dancers themselves, and they knew very well the pain they suffered.

Dancers, why don't you say a few words for yourselves?

The donations of scholarship assistance for poor students in Shanghai, blocking pedestrians for money, seem slightly inferior to those of students in Beiping.

Poor students in Beiping, in order to raise scholarship assistance funds, work on their own during the summer vacation; for example, a large number of students are mobilized to shine shoes for the public. This form of scholarship assistance movement is respectable and moving! Rich children can take cars to school, and poor students automatically shine shoes on the streets for the tuition fees for the next semester. Their actions themselves already have the value of "social education."

We support the spraying of DDT on tricycles and rickshaws for the health of passengers.

However, two-wheeled rickshaw drivers often sweat all day long on the streets, and when passengers are rushing in the constant wind, they often smell a salty sourness, which seems unhygienic. Even if DDT is sprayed, what's the use?

I have to digress, the three-wheeled rickshaw drivers and their slums really need "hygiene," I wonder if there is so much free DDT available?

### The Dream of Japanese Goods Flooding the Market

— Wang Runyuan

— Ajinomoto and Kadou Eye Drops are Coming!

Occasionally, in Hongkou, Shanghai, I see remnants of Japanese merchants' signs and stalls selling bits and pieces of Japanese goods, and I always feel uneasy. I think to myself that one day, we will completely get rid of these things. I've been in Shanghai for a year now, but I still see shop signs with unwashed-off patterns and characters, and occasionally I see Ajinomoto in food shops and medicines of unknown use in pharmacies. This is also because our compatriots are too lazy to notice these unpleasant signs, or perhaps Japanese merchants left behind too much stock, and not many people are buying it, so it has been selling slowly for years. Who would have thought that after August 15th, these signs and advertisements would still be useful, and the stock would not only not be sold out, but new goods would be shipped in large quantities!

The nights after the start of autumn are indeed much cooler. Those who love to sleep can indulge in sweet dreams. Leaning against the bed frame with a newspaper in hand, my eyes are looking at it, but my mind is vaguely thinking about something. Soon, I no longer know what the words on the newspaper actually are. Suddenly, I returned to my distant hometown. The farmers in the fields were all wearing padded jackets made of cloth from the Nagasaki Osaka Textile Mill, and the village girls had all added large shirts made of flowered calico. I was so surprised that I couldn't even speak. I clearly remembered that my family had written to me, saying that things were too expensive and the times were not peaceful, and they couldn't afford even an inch of cloth, and their clothes were patched and patched to make do. How could this be? But my family wouldn't lie to me. There must be a reason. I couldn't help but ask the second sister-in-law of my old neighbor. Ah, the second sister-in-law sighed before speaking. "Since Japan surrendered, it's been two years. Which family can afford to buy new clothes? Cloth is more expensive than satin. My third child hasn't worn a new piece of clothing since birth. The eldest's are altered for the second, and the second's are altered for the third. Recently, cloth has become cheaper. They say Japanese goods are coming again. Who cares about Japanese or Chinese? I'll buy a couple of feet to patch things up if it's cheap." I felt indescribably uncomfortable after hearing that. Ah, right, I returned home very happy. I saw relatives I hadn't seen for many years. We talked about what had happened since we last met. The older ones had more white hair, and the younger ones had grown half a foot taller. My younger brother used to crawl on the ground, but now he carries a schoolbag. The paper he uses for school is Japanese, the pencils are Japanese, the knives are Japanese, nothing is not Japanese except for the writing brush. How did you all start using Japanese goods? Japan was defeated less than two years ago. Who cares what kind of goods they are? Cheap is good. My younger brother felt he had given me a very clever answer. I was speechless because it was my first day home, and everyone was happy. My grandmother specially made some good dishes for me. On the one hand, it was because I hadn't tasted hometown flavors for many years, and on the other hand, it was because my grandmother cooked them herself. I found them very delicious and repeatedly said how good they were. My grandmother was very pleased and replied, "The vegetables are grown in the garden, very fresh. Adding some 'Ajinomoto' makes them especially flavorful. We haven't been able to buy good 'Ajinomoto' for two years, but now it's available again." I had nothing to say, but I just felt that something was not right.

The next day, I went to the county town two miles from my home to visit relatives. As soon as I entered the city gate, there were many posters on the streets: Dongyangtang, Corporation, Marunouchi, Old Dou Eye Drops, University Eye Drops, and Lieber. It was practically Japan. Except for the tiled houses, everything was filled with Japanese goods. I couldn't bear it anymore. I thought to myself, what is this? I quickly left the road and hastily visited a few relatives. When I returned home, I said that evening that I had things to do in Shanghai and couldn't stay long. My family didn't think much of it, but they couldn't keep me. With a heavy heart, I took the train and then the ship back to Shanghai. Before getting off the ship, I saw an old friend standing on the dock to pick me up. I was delighted. When the ship docked, I rushed off the ship to shake hands and exchange greetings. Only then did I take a closer look at this old friend's attire: a brand-new navy-blue serge suit and a brightly colored tie. I said, "Old Lu, how come you've been so successful recently? Your outfit has been upgraded." Old Lu said, "Don't make fun of me. Before, clothing materials cost over two million, and that was for domestic goods. Good foreign goods cost tens of millions. How could we afford that? Now Japanese wool has arrived, which is much cheaper, so I took the opportunity to get a suit. Don't be surprised. If you look around the market, there are many things that are cheaper. Although money is worthless, Japanese goods are cheaper than other goods." I was truly stunned. I didn't expect Shanghai to have returned to the old days before the victory. I felt very unhappy. I took my luggage, hired a car, and returned to my residence. My sister saw me return and asked about things at home. I spoke somewhat listlessly about some things. The next day, I went to the factory to ask for leave. The factory site was originally in the industrial area. After the victory, there were already many smokestacks not emitting smoke. In the past two years, due to economic instability, some factories had started operating, but many had to close again because they couldn't afford to pay. This time, it was even worse. Many factories had closed, especially some small light industrial factories. They couldn't withstand the impact of Japanese goods dumping and couldn't compete, so they had to close down. I said, "It's over, it's over. Eight years of resistance, all the blood was shed in vain. Is it the fate of the Chinese people to let Japan repeat the disaster of economic invasion once again?" I felt a pang in my heart and burst into tears. Suddenly, I heard my sister call me, "Wake up, what are you dreaming about? Did your girlfriend change her mind again?" I opened my eyes, and the room was brightly lit. I was still holding the newspaper in my hand, and I knew that I had just been dreaming. I couldn't believe that I had such a strange dream, so I told my sister everything. My sister said, "This isn't a dream. Maybe next August 15th, it will be like this. If you don't believe me, go home next year and see. Shanghai will be about the same." But I always hope it's just a dream.

Satirical Comedy "Fake Phoenixes and Sham Dragons"

Due to the opposition raised by the barbers' union and their demand to ban the film, this "Fake Phoenixes and Sham Dragons" has become known throughout Shanghai. As a result, this dispute has given "Wen Hua" unexpected publicity.

But does this film really insult barbers?

After we watched it, the definite answer is no. The playwright portrays the pair of barbers, Number Three and Number Seven, as kind and simple, while the female lead, Fan Ruhua, is vain and accustomed to luxury. But in essence, she is still a good person. Otherwise, she would not have given up her enjoyment and married "Number Three" in the end. She even joined the Times Barber Shop as a manicurist. All of this demonstrates the value of those who earn their own living, and Fan Ruhua's awakening is the right path for her to take.

However, in terms of scriptwriting techniques, this cannot be considered a top-notch comedy. The scriptwriting seems insufficiently clean and concise, and the director, Zuo Lin, has obviously put in a lot of effort in his handling. However, due to the director's insufficient familiarity with film techniques, many transitions between scenes are relatively awkward, especially the editing is even more inappropriate. On the whole, a new director with such achievements can be considered competent.

Shi Hui and Li Lihua are the two main leads who carry the most weight in the whole play. Shi Hui's acting skills are more skilled, while Li Lihua's appear relatively stiff in comparison. Ye Ming's "Number Seven" is too restrained and rigid. In the entire play, Chen小姐 (Miss Chen) played by Lu Shan and 張太太 (Mrs. Zhang) played by Zhang Wan are the best.

We don't know why "Wen Hua" authorities wanted to use Li Lihua to star in this film? Audiences with good memories probably still remember "Spring River Regret," a collaborative film with the Japanese puppets during the occupation period, the female lead was this very Li Lihua who joined hands with the enemy.

Depressing Psychological Film "Sick Beauty"

Recently, Hollywood has been popular with filming psychological films. This "Sick Beauty" belongs to this type of play. But these so-called psychological films, if strictly speaking, are just superficial psychological analyses, at most, just wanting to change the audience's taste.

"Sick Beauty" is adapted from Darrell Fordson's play. Precisely because the adapter's skills are poor, the entire play is still limited to a residence, and the female lead Yingling, who has mental illness, needs a beautiful and elegant environment for treatment. However, the adapter needs her to focus on disrupting this peaceful family, so that she can develop as much as possible in this house—acting. Therefore, she is just a puppet being led, and the development in terms of reason and emotion is very far-fetched.

The director's handling of this play is also more depressing. The middle scenes are dragged out for too long, so that the transitions in the later scenes are abrupt and slightly uncoordinated. In short, although the director's handling of the play is very meticulous, it is still not brilliant.

Among the actors, Anna Brest's sick beauty Yingling, although trying very hard to act, never really gets into the role. Compared with her other films, this play is relatively inferior. Leif Bremer's painter is steady and refined in his acting, and is very competent.

Not Worth Watching "Little Five Righteous"

This "Little Five Righteous" is produced by a small American film company. Regardless of the script, director, and actors, they are all below standard. Even compared with the most inferior domestic films, such as "Female Spy No. 76" and "Loyal Soul of Interrogation," such a film is no better.

Even the most patient audience cannot finish watching this film.

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Clarification

### Leaving Behind Thousands of Acres for Ungrateful Descendants: Siblings Divide Property and Cook Each Other in the Pot

Editor: I have two legal questions, please advise: (1) The deceased Mr. So-and-so had one son and one daughter. The daughter was married before 1927. The deceased died in 1946. Does the married daughter have the right to inherit property? (2) Mr. So-and-so has over a thousand acres of land. In 1939, his married daughter was given some property by her father because of financial difficulties. At that time, his son, relying on his economic pressure, incited his father and daughter to sign a unilateral contract, stating that she would voluntarily waive her right to inherit property. Is this contract valid?

[Answered by Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) Yes, inheritance begins upon the death of the deceased. Under current law, married women have the right to inherit property. (2) No. In the Supreme Court's ruling No. 2652 of 1933, it states: "Although the right to inherit property can be waived by the heir, it must be after he has obtained the right to inherit. Therefore, according to Article 1174, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, the waiver of the right to inherit should be made in writing to the court, family council, or other heirs within two months from the time of knowing that he can inherit. Therefore, the time of waiver must be after knowing that he can inherit, and the so-called knowing that he can inherit must be after the inheritance has begun. Otherwise, if the inheritance has not yet begun, how can one know if he can inherit? If the waiver is made before knowing that he can inherit, it is legally invalid. See also Article 1175 of the same law, which stipulates that the waiver of inheritance takes effect retroactively to the time when the inheritance began. Since it is retroactive, it is clear that the waiver must be after the inheritance has begun, and should not be waived in advance." Furthermore, a gift before the inheritance begins is not sufficient to deprive the recipient of her right to inherit property.
