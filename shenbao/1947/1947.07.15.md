Wartime Loans Were Not Wasted

The Central Bank has accounts that can be checked, and the US Export-Import Bank also has accounts that can be checked. The so-called waste is completely unfounded." Mr. Kong also stated that the situation in the twenty-odd counties in central Shanxi is still good, but Shanxi is suffering from a severe drought this year. If it does not rain within days, there will be a disaster. Shanxi's grain requisition is relatively heavy, and the pricing is too low, causing the people to suffer under the burden.

### Ambassador Stuart to Return to Nanjing Today - According to Sources, Special Envoy Wedemeyer Will Come to China Within the Week - China's Economic Crisis Can Be Eliminated

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Ambassador Stuart will leave Beiping for Nanjing on the 15th, but according to sources, the Ambassador will return to Beiping in two weeks. The Ambassador told reporters that General Wedemeyer will arrive in China within the next four or five days, without a long delay. Wedemeyer has a special mission for his visit to China and will stay in China for a maximum of six weeks. After Washington announced Wedemeyer's visit to China for investigation, many believed that this symbolized a change in US policy towards China. The Ambassador believed that this view needed to be revised. He stated that the fundamental principles of the US policy towards China will not change, and if there is any change, it will be methodological or technical. The US's principle towards China is to hope that China becomes a peaceful, free, unified, democratic, and prosperous country. When asked whether the US's dispatch of Wedemeyer, who strongly agrees with the National Government, to China means that it is abandoning its neutrality towards the internal conflicts in China, he replied: The United States is willing to help the government supported by the Chinese people. The United States is willing to assist any government in the world. If the government of any country can demonstrate that it is supported by the people, the United States is willing to assist that government. The Ambassador also stated that the current civil war and economic crisis in China are a symptom of a disease. As long as the government can truly grasp the people's hearts, the symptom can eventually be eliminated.

### US Decides on Aid to China Plan - To Be Handled Separately From Other Areas in the Far East - Marshall to Announce Important Policy

[Our Report] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast; Scrimpers Newspaper Washington Correspondent Parkerle Cable says: Wedemeyer's new appointment heralds a change in American policy, designed to do its utmost in the current crisis. General Wei's return to the Far East is intended to first secure America's position, so as to calmly take more substantial action.

The current plans of the US government include: (1) Reorganizing the National Government again, but without the participation of the CCP, and providing direct assistance from the United States. (2) Providing limited financial assistance for economic reconstruction under US supervision, following the model of the aid to Greece plan. (3) Promoting an early end to military action. (4) Reducing the size of the army to make it a fully equipped force.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall will announce his important policies on Monday. Regarding the China issue, it is widely believed that the future direction of the United States will depend on the results of the Wedemeyer mission's investigation, but in any case, aid to China will be handled separately from other areas in the Far East. Although Marshall made the cooperation of European countries an element of his Marshall plan for reconstruction, it is widely believed that China will not be included in the entire Eastern plan. At the same time, reliable sources also believe that before the European plan can prove successful, an overall plan for the Far East will not be drafted immediately. Therefore, it is widely believed that since the groundwork has already been laid in Asia, the plan is likely to advocate expanding the aid plan to Asia first.

In addition, the Shanghai Branch of the National Diplomacy Association believes that General Wei is a comrade-in-arms of China and has made outstanding contributions while serving in the Chinese theater.

The original production undertakings must be protected as much as possible and actively developed, and the new production undertakings should be gradually increased with reasonable and effective plans.

In addition, how to coordinate the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce and establish our national economic art is also extremely important. When the great construction undertakings are being promoted, we firmly hope that friendly countries will assist and cooperate, but self-reliance is especially important, and it is even more important for both labor and management to work together to complete the national production and construction. Regarding stabilizing prices, Wei pointed out that price fluctuations are a major malady in China's economic sector. The main reasons are the hoarding and speculation by a few people, the manipulation of speculation, and the bad psychology of the general public. These causes must be eradicated in order to stabilize prices and promote the happiness of the people. The whole country must strictly abide by laws and regulations in order to safely get through the economic difficulties.

Editorial
Basic Allied Policy Toward Japan
The U.S. Far Eastern Commission recently announced the basic policy toward Japan after its surrender. The scope of this policy is very broad. According to news reports, the "ultimate goals" of the Allies after Japan's surrender, as stated in this basic policy, are: (1) To ensure that Japan is no longer a threat to world peace and prosperity, and to establish a democratic and peaceful government as soon as possible, so that it can fulfill its international responsibilities, respect the rights of other countries, and support the goals of the United Nations; (2) The above goals can be achieved by limiting Japanese sovereignty to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and other outlying islands to be determined, disarming Japan, abolishing military government, encouraging democratic institutions, implementing reserved industries to support its economy, and allowing fair reparations. The basic policy also stipulates the necessary conditions for submitting reparations, specifying that reparations will be extracted from Japan's existing funds and equipment, as well as from existing Japanese goods and goods that can be produced in the future. As for the amount of reparations each country should receive, it will be based on a broad political foundation and the extent of material and human losses. In this way, China may receive the largest amount of reparations, while the Soviet Union may receive very limited reparations. 

It is worth noting that this basic policy is the basic policy of the Allies towards Japan, not the basic policy of the United States or any other country towards Japan. The decision-making body for this policy is the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, D.C., which includes representatives from all Allied countries that fought against Japan. This policy has been under consideration in the Far Eastern Commission for a year and a half and was decided after careful study by the Allied countries. Originally, since General MacArthur took Tokyo after Japan's surrender, the U.S. government had unilaterally instructed General MacArthur on the preliminary policy towards Japan after its surrender in September 1945. This preliminary policy has been the guideline for MacArthur's rule in Japan over the years. Now, the basic policy announced by the Far Eastern Commission has replaced the "preliminary policy" unilaterally promulgated by the United States in the past. From now on, MacArthur's rule in Japan will no longer be based on the "preliminary policy" unilaterally announced by the U.S. government, but must follow the "basic policy" promulgated by the Far Eastern Commission in everything. In other words, this basic policy after Japan's surrender is in effect the great charter for the Allied countries to rule Japan in the future. 

In terms of its content, the "basic policy" promulgated by the Far Eastern Commission this time is not much different from the "preliminary policy" promulgated by the U.S. government in the past. The "basic policy" is, in general, a reiteration of the "preliminary policy". However, there are a few points that are worth noting: (1) Regarding reparations, the basic policy clearly states that they will be extracted from existing Japanese goods and goods that can be produced in the future. The "preliminary plan" of September 1935 stipulated that reparations would be paid from machinery and equipment and existing goods that Japan did not need for its peacetime economy. This time, the basic policy has been extended to include goods that can be produced in the future. This provision expands the scope of Japanese reparations. (2) The basic policy also clearly states that the amount of reparations received should be based on the extent of material and human losses suffered. This provision is naturally very reasonable. Although this principle has been adopted for the priority implementation of Japan's temporary reparations, it did not have a legal basis until the announcement of this basic policy. 

Next, in this basic policy announced this time, we see the following explicit statement: The Supreme Commander will also carry out the following two points: (1) All economic figures whose past history cannot be trusted to guide Japan's economic efforts towards peaceful and democratic purposes will be prohibited by the Supreme Commander from regaining important positions; (2) Formulate a plan for the liberalization of large industrial and banking unions, and replace them with other organizations based on a broader basis of control and ownership. Regarding the above two points, although MacArthur has cleaned up some financial groups in the past, it is worth noting whether Japanese financial groups will disintegrate as a result of this cleanup, or appear in a new form in post-surrender Japan. The key to the disintegration of financial groups and other special forces is not in their external form, but in their internal hearts. This is truly like Japanese politics, which, although calling for a trend towards democracy, secretly has a strong remnant of militarism. Yukio Ozaki is a clear example. Therefore, when destroying Japanese militarism and other special forces, we always hope that MacArthur can thoroughly implement the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission. 

We must also point out here that the basic policy states "limiting Japanese sovereignty to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and other outlying islands to be determined." The so-called outlying islands here only refer to the islands adjacent to the Japanese mainland, and not only cannot include the Ryukyu Islands, but also cannot include the Ogasawara Islands east of the Ryukyu Islands. Our allied forces have suffered heavy casualties in the Ryukyu Islands and Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands. The attribution of these islands should no longer be a problem. However, due to the recent clamor of Japanese people, this point should be especially pointed out again. 

The Greek War Breaks Out Again
In this series of developments involving the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, and the European Economic Cooperation Organization, we see the breakdown of the Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference and the refusal of countries behind the "Iron Curtain" to participate in European economic cooperation. Today, we see the emergence of the same "International Brigades" as in the Spanish Civil War, and the so-called Greek guerrilla forces invading Greece from Albania, and preparing to form another government within Greece to oppose the legal government of Greece. How this situation will develop still needs to be proven by future facts; but the little information we know now is enough to make us pay more attention to the development of the Greek situation. 

Will Greece become Spain the Second? The "International Brigade" was an armed force of the International Communist Party that participated in the Spanish Civil War, and now it has appeared in Greece again, coupled with Greek exiles and the Communist Party, it will inevitably lead to a re-enactment of the war to fight for what they see as "democracy" and "liberation." However, the development of this situation clearly allows the world to understand the background behind it. The world will not doubt how this situation came about. This is probably a response to the actions of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. 

Although the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan have not yet officially extended to the Far East, aren't the situation developing in China in recent years and the style of the Chinese Communist Party the same as the "guerrilla forces" that recently appeared in Greece? We must raise our vigilance!

U.S. Congress to Temporarily Suspend Action on Marshall Plan
No Need to Convene a Special Meeting This Autumn
Vandenberg Announces After Attending Important White House Meeting
[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: The hopes of implementing the Marshall Plan early and transferring 400,000 refugees to the United States have now been completely shattered. The U.S. Congress has decided not to take swift action on this matter. President Truman met with congressional leaders today, and Vandenberg announced afterward that the leaders agreed that there was no need to convene a special session of Congress this autumn. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee may convene a meeting in January to prepare several unnamed bills. Representative Knutson declared today that he will soon introduce a bill opposing aid to any country that does not support the Marshall Plan. Doubts continued that if the Marshall Plan does not include a policy of appeasement, it would be excellent. It is not necessary to provide aid to countries that accept Kremlin orders. Vandenberg continued that President Truman is extremely concerned about the refugee entry issue, and Congress will also strive to find a way to resolve the issue, but Congress may not be able to take action before January. 

[French News Agency, Washington, 14th] Truman convened six congressional giants today to hold a meeting to discuss the issue of the United States' participation in European affairs. It is widely believed that the content is the same issue that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have recently discussed with the two-party leaders. 

[French News Agency, Baltimore, Maryland, 13th] Maryland Democratic Senator Tydings said today that President Truman hinted when discussing the tax reduction bill today that the United States would allocate 3 to 5 billion U.S. dollars for the European Recovery Program, and this amount would not be included in the regular budget. The President firmly opposes the tax reduction bill because he believes that the United States plans to use large sums of money to aid Europe, so that the U.S. Treasury can maintain a safe balance. 

Optimistic About the Future of the European Conference
Each Committee Can Be Formed
U.S. Ambassador to France Hosts Representatives of Attending Countries
[United Press, Paris, 14th] The working committee of the European Economic Conference met today and completed recommendations on the organization of various technical subcommittees, which will be submitted to the third plenary session tomorrow. In addition, U.S. Ambassador to France Caffery hosted a banquet last night for the leaders of the 16-nation delegations and held informal discussions with some representatives. Although the United States did not participate in the conference, there is no sign so far that Washington is influencing the discussions of the conference, but the friendly concern of the U.S. government can be seen here. 

[French News Agency, Paris, 13th] The atmosphere is optimistic after the second plenary session of the Paris Economic Conference was held today. According to people attending the meeting, the third plenary session to be held on the 15th may declare the end of the conference. The foreign ministers of various countries will return home immediately, and the subcommittees will conduct various technical work separately. The working committee issued a definition at the third meeting, stating that the work they are responsible for is technical in nature and does not involve political or other general issues. The representatives exchanged opinions at the time and were extremely harmonious. Diplomatic observers here said that the good atmosphere in the venue is a natural result of the cooperation of all countries. 

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The progress of the European Economic Recovery Conference and its working committee has so far met the expectations of Britain and France, which convened the conference, but the remarks of the Scandinavian representatives are not without veiled unease. The working committee should make two important resolutions today (Monday): (1) How many countries should be allowed to participate in the executive committee of the cooperation committee; (2) Which countries should serve as members of the four technical subcommittees: food and agriculture, coal and electricity, transportation, and iron and steel. The first issue is expected to be hotly debated. 

Austria in a Difficult Situation
Prime Minister Explains Difficulties
[Reuters, Vienna, 14th] Austrian Interior Minister Helmer told the Austrian Socialist Party Congress that Austria originally hoped that all major European powers could participate in the Paris Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan, but the Soviet Union and the countries in its sphere of influence refused, which made the situation of East-West confrontation increasingly clear, and it must be difficult for Austria to obtain a post-war treaty. Austria does not want to be politically connected to Eastern Europe or Western Europe, and only wants to obtain the assistance needed to revive Austria. Helmer also denied the outside world's rumors that the Austrian government intends to move from Vienna to the U.S. military district of Salzburg, as a deliberate fabrication by traitors.

French cabinet ministers and other people were also present to accompany them. There is a popular anecdote that Mrs. Bidault asked her husband why he did not set the opening date of the Paris Economic Conference to July 15. Mrs. Bidault was eager to take a three-day vacation for the French National Day, not because she wanted to dance wildly in the streets with the French people to celebrate the National Day, but because she wanted to rest in her residence for three days. However, Foreign Minister Bidault replied: "Europe first," and refused his wife's suggestion to take a three-day vacation.

European Conference Passes Seven Important Amended Cases
[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The second plenary session of the Paris Conference was held at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, chaired by Bevin. The chairman of the working committee, Director of External Economic Affairs Alphand, reported that the working committee had passed the organization plan and procedural rules, and made important amendments to the original British and French plans attached to the invitation. The motive for the amendments was to make the proposed organization a fully effective and democratic institution. The amendments are as follows: (1) At the suggestion of several delegations, especially the Turkish delegation, the Cooperation Committee should keep its doors open to all participating countries and other European countries that have not yet participated but are willing to participate. (2) The Cooperation Committee establishes an executive committee. (3) At the suggestion of the Belgian delegation and with the support of the Dutch, Danish, Italian, Swedish, and Norwegian delegations, it was decided to allow the Cooperation Committee to make appropriate amendments to the organization plan at any time when necessary to make it fully flexible. (4) Greece suggested that the technical committee should not be too restricted, and France supported it. Special attention should be paid to construction issues. Italy suggested that special attention should be paid to human resources issues. (5) At the suggestion of Sweden, existing institutions should maintain close relations with the United Nations institutions and their affiliated institutions, as well as existing international economic institutions. (6) At the suggestion of the Netherlands, when the Cooperation Committee prepares a report on the resources and needs of European countries, a period of four years should be used as a limit. The four-year period was decided to be deleted. The Netherlands believes that it is not possible to predict the development of such a fearful period. (7) Existing trade agreements between European countries will not be interfered with. 

[French News Agency, Athens, 14th] It is reported that a large number of troops are concentrated in Albania near the Greek border, and they belong to an international military brigade. The attack on Konitsa, Greece, from the Albanian border is underway, and the scale is larger than before. The French Embassy in Greece issued a communiqué today denying the so-called international army of 2,500 people landing in Cete and going to the Balkans. 

[Reuters, London, 14th] The Belgrade Radio reported that Greek guerrillas have launched a new offensive in the Florina area, 50 miles northeast of the city of Konitsa in Greece. Belgrade Radio also claimed that eleven units of the "International Brigade" have crossed the Greek border and engaged with the Greek government army. The Greek government's communiqué this morning stated that Greek guerrillas and Albanians invaded Greece from Albania this morning and attacked Konitsa. The invading troops, about 1,000 people, have occupied Polosani near the border and have surrounded the city of Konitsa. The defenders are resisting bravely. The communiqué also said that a large number of Albanian troops and a unit of the International Brigade are concentrating along the Albanian border, but officials here do not believe that they have invaded Greece.

Also, three Greek Air Force planes will carry the United Nations Balkan investigation team to Konitsa. 

British Concerns
[French News Agency, London, 14th] Well-informed sources said today that the British Press Office has received detailed reports on the activities of international troops invading Greece.

Katayama Faces Serious Difficulties
New Rifts in the Japanese Cabinet
Labor Policy Causes a Huge Wave
[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] The Katayama three-party coalition cabinet has been constantly hit internally and externally since it was勉strongformed, and cracks have become increasingly apparent. Previously, friction occurred between the Socialist and Democratic parties over the issue of national management of coal mines. Now, the weakness of the coalition cabinet is exposed again due to the labor disaster insurance issue. Atsushi Ichimatsu, a Democratic Party member, insisted that the Labor Disaster Insurance should still be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, while Kokusho Yonekubo, the Socialist Party's Minister of Labor, expressed his opposition. Neither party would give way, so it was decided that Prime Minister Katayama would make a ruling. On the 14th, Katayama expressed that it should be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Labor, while Ichimatsu invited Ashida and other Democratic Party cabinet members to a meeting. As a result of the agreement, the Democratic Party cabinet members decided to support Ichimatsu. On the afternoon of the 14th, Ashida notified Katayama of this opinion. Katayama was quite surprised after hearing this, fearing that if this matter expanded, it would have a serious impact on the coalition cabinet, so he intended to cancel his previous statement. However, Minister of State Yonekuso expressed a tough opposition at this time, forcing Katayama to insist on his proposal, saying that this was the hope of the entire labor community and could not be given up. However, Ichimatsu said that after the Labor Disaster Insurance business was handed over, the scope of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's business would be too small, and its speaking power in the cabinet would be weakened, so he also said that he could not give way. This matter has developed into an emotional issue between the Socialist and Democratic parties, and its trend is worth noting. 

Australian Prime Minister Talks About Evatt's Mission to Japan
Said He Would Never Conflict with MacArthur
[United Press, Canberra, 14th] Australian Prime Minister Chifley declared today that Foreign Minister Evatt left Sydney by ship on the 11th and will arrive in Tokyo at the end of the month.

"You don't need to worry too much that Evatt's trip to Japan will cause an argument with MacArthur. Although we have different opinions with MacArthur, please dispel any thoughts of friction." Recently, Australia has repeatedly protested because MacArthur allowed the Japanese to dispatch whaling fleets to the Antarctic and mine Angaur. Re-propose a protest. 

Liberal Party Cadres Suspected in the Case of Hidden Materials in Japan
Parliament Forms a Special Investigation Committee
[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Since the end of the war, the materials hidden by Japanese soldiers, officials, and financial groups have reached approximately 1.6 billion yen. It is now known that some Liberal Party cadres are also related to this case of hidden materials, so the Katayama cabinet has suspended the investigation work. However, on the 14th, the Diet, from its own independent position, established a special investigation committee on hidden materials and decided to thoroughly investigate. It is also said that the chairman of the committee will be elected by the Socialist Party. 

Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs Investigates the Whereabouts of Bose's Belongings
[French News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Indian puppet National Army leader Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose died in an air crash in Taipei after Japan surrendered. The whereabouts of the large amount of wealth he carried in the plane are unknown. The Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs is now conducting a thorough investigation under the orders of MacArthur's headquarters. 

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 13th Airmail] According to news obtained here, Bose, the leader of the Indian puppet organization, did die in the countryside between Taoyuan and Songshan, Taiwan on August 21, 1945. The place is very close to the 大 flying field. The plane flying from India to Tokyo had an obstacle in the airspace there. When the team landed, Bose was already and was sent to the hospital but died. The treasures he brought with him, worth US$200 million, were plundered from various parts of India and were intended to be spent in Japan to live his tourist life, or it was rumored that it was a tribute to Japan. After the accident, the Japanese military authorities kept the secret. Although there was news from the outside world, the truth was never clear, but it is very likely that it was speculated that the treasures had been divided up by senior Japanese military officers or were no longer in Taiwan. Afterwards, an Indian reporter made a special trip to Taiwan to interview, but did not get any results.

When Jinnah was asked if he would no longer be involved in practical politics and resign from the post of chairman of the Muslim League, he replied: "I will participate in politics and have more contact with reality." 

[Reuters, New Delhi, 14th] Gandhi met with our reporter in a hut in the scavenger residential area in Delhi today and issued a statement, believing that the split of the Indian Army will cause a serious civil war. He does not understand why the Indian Army cannot remain unified to prevent foreign aggression. The division of the army weakens the national defense.

Gandhi also said that he was deeply gratified that Jinnah had agreed to serve as the Governor-General of Pakistan and had guaranteed complete religious freedom and the safety of property and lives of minorities in the territory.

The Minister of Economic Affairs Expresses to the Cotton Spinning Industry: Exercise Caution in Adjusting Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth, and Strictly Control Materials to Adapt to the General Mobilization Order.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian, at a banquet recently held to entertain representatives from the local cotton spinning industry, gave a speech regarding the government's current policies on yarn and cloth regulation. He stated: "Since the government issued the General Mobilization Order, the control of materials will be stricter. Cotton yarn is a particularly important material, so it should be regulated with even greater caution. The success of this regulation policy depends on the cooperation of all parties. Therefore, I hope that all yarn factories will prioritize the interests of the nation and the people, so that the regulation policy will naturally be successful." Mr. Chen then listed three points of hope: (1) Reasonable Pricing: Simply acknowledging black market prices as the cost of reproduction is unacceptable as a pricing standard. However, given current market volatility, calculating prices solely based on original costs may be insufficient. Therefore, reasonable pricing should seek the most reasonable compromise between original and reproduction costs. (2) Joint Distribution: Careful selection of distribution targets is essential to prevent cotton yarn from falling into the hands of speculators and hoarders. The proposed certificate distribution system (where a designated agency issues yarn purchase certificates, which are then presented to yarn factories to obtain yarn) could potentially start with the implementation of a joint distribution system. (3) Commission Spinning and Weaving: Starting with the second quarter's quota-exempt cotton, the government will adopt a commission spinning policy. The spun yarn will then be commissioned to weaving businesses for weaving. The finished products will then be directly sold through retail stores to benefit the general public. The government will comprehensively and rationally allocate resources across all three stages of cotton, yarn, and cloth."

[Another Report] The Textile Regulation Committee may convene pricing and finished product transportation and sales sub-committee meetings this afternoon to devise dynamic countermeasures based on the current yarn market situation. Furthermore, the "Implementation Plan for Developing the Textile Industry and Regulating Yarn and Cloth Supply," passed by the fifth committee meeting, is currently being finalized and will be submitted to the Ministry for review in the coming days. The outline of the plan will then be publicly announced.

### Industry Insider Speaks: Reasons for the Yarn Market's Bullishness

### Yarn Factories Are Not Providing a Sufficient Supply to the Market, and Pricing Is Disconnected from Market Rates

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to industry insiders, the bullishness of the yarn market last week was mainly due to the limited amount of yarn supplied by yarn factories to yarn merchants. The reasons why yarn factories are unable to supply yarn in sufficient quantities are: (1) One batch of 10,000 bales of yarn for joint distribution must be successively allocated before the 15th of this month. (2) Over 30,000 bales of cotton spun from cotton supplied by the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) for April, May, and June must be submitted to the Textile Regulation Committee. (3) Of the 10 million US dollar bonds subscribed to by the Six-Region Cotton Spinning Association, besides the 30% paid in cash upfront, the remaining 7 million must be offset with cotton yarn. (4) Yarn spun from the second quarter's quota-exempt cotton under the commission spinning policy must be entirely submitted to the Textile Regulation Committee. Consequently, all yarn factories are using the excuse of yarn shortages, claiming that all cotton yarn is now concentrated in the hands of the government. Although the Textile Regulation Committee's joint distribution system has just begun, the allocated quantity is small and only extends to weaving businesses. Only a few yarn dealers, those who are long-standing clients of the yarn factories, can occasionally obtain three or four bales. Before the implementation of the joint distribution system, ordinary yarn dealers could still source yarn from the black market if needed. However, because most of the yarn produced by the factories is now concentrated in the Textile Regulation Committee, it is difficult to purchase yarn even on the black market. However, some people criticize yarn factories for holding onto yarn and not selling it, using the excuse of submitting yarn to the government. The key issue remains the disconnection between the market price and the regulated price. Otherwise, how could there be instances of some yarn factories effectively selling yarn at market prices? Fortunately, the sales channels to out-of-town merchants have been weak recently, and the market prices in Tianjin and Guangzhou are similar to those in Shanghai. As a result, the cost of transportation and interest expenses negates any profit from selling to those markets, so although the yarn market rose last week, the trend is still relatively stable.

### Yarn Merchants Again Request Yarn Allocation from the Textile Regulation Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Yarn Merchants Association, in order to have the authorities maintain yarn allocation to the industry, thereby regulating the supply and demand of the yarn market and stabilizing yarn prices, previously sent a letter to the Textile Regulation Committee. The Committee responded that current yarn allocation is temporarily targeted at weaving businesses. However, it did not absolutely reject yarn allocation to yarn merchants. Now, the Yarn Merchants Association believes that yarn factories are required to submit yarn to the authorities in batches, resulting in a further reduction in the allocation quota for yarn dealers, which has caused market prices to rise again. Therefore, they submitted a letter to the Textile Regulation Committee again yesterday, requesting the restoration of yarn allocation to the industry. They stated that the yarn demand of weaving businesses varies between slow and peak seasons. Since the regulated prices are now dynamic, the targets of cotton yarn allocation should also adopt a dynamic approach based on actual market needs, so as to regulate yarn market supply and demand and stabilize yarn prices.

### Cotton Market Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the spot cotton market saw a further price increase due to high demand from yarn factories. Although cotton yarn prices have declined, the cotton market remains strong due to limited availability and the transition between seasons, resulting in demand exceeding supply. The prices for various grades of cotton for factory delivery were: Bao Er: 2,220,000, 2,250,000 to 2,320,000, 2,350,000. Shanghai yarn: 2,080,000, Chongming Shanghai yarn: 2,040,000, 2,070,000 to 2,090,000. Han fine cotton: 2,000,000, 2,070,000, 2,090,000 to 2,150,000. 1/16 Midland cotton: 2,600,000, Shunde cotton: 2,050,000. The prices for cotton traded in the market were: Lingshi cotton: 2,050,000, 2,190,000 to 2,220,000, Han fine cotton: 1,950,000, 1,970,000, 2,020,000, 2,070,000, 2,090,000, 2,150,000. Shunde cotton: 2,020,000, 2,150,000. Chongming Shanghai cotton: 2,060,000, Jingyang cotton: 2,250,000, Zhoupu seed cotton: 356,000 per unit.

### Both Yarn and Cloth See Price Declines

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market declined due to tight credit conditions and sales from yarn factories, as well as the opening of yarn distribution by the Textile Construction Company. As a result, the prices of various yarn counts declined. Later, due to supply exceeding demand, buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the price of 42-count yarn fell to 20,020,000, a decrease of 400,000 compared to Saturday. The price of 20-count "Special Double Horse" yarn also fell to 12,800,000, and "Double Horse" yarn was 12,700,000, both down by 200,000 to 300,000. The prices of other yarn counts, including 40-count, 32-count, 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count coarse and fine yarns, all decreased by varying amounts ranging from 200,000 to 500,000.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was sluggish due to slow actual sales, a wait-and-see attitude among out-of-town merchants, and only scattered sales in the local market. Rumors that the authorities would implement unified purchase and distribution of cotton cloth also dampened market sentiment, resulting in supply exceeding demand and a decline in market prices. As a result, the prices of various grades of fine cloth uniformly declined by 3,000 to 7,000, while the prices of bleached cloth and broadcloth softened. However, the prices of colored cloth continued to rise due to increased dyeing costs. The Shanghai Linbu Factory adjusted its prices, so the market was relatively strong.

### Textile Construction Company Yarn Distribution

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company yesterday followed its routine of acting on behalf of the Textile Regulation Committee to carry out joint yarn distribution, distributing a total of 1,810 bales. A total of 834 purchase applications were received, and all were allocated to various weaving factories.

### Flannel Demand Exceeds Supply

The flannel market remained tense yesterday. Although actual sales were limited, there were many transactions for autumn and winter goods. Linen canvas, white canvas, and rainproof cloth were also actively traded. Thick flannel and overcoat flannel remained in short supply and expensive. All-wool suit flannel was in high demand, standing out from the rest of the market. British goods were generally selling for over 800,000 per yard, American goods were selling for around 600,000, and top-grade locally-made flannel was being offered for 550,000 to 560,000 wholesale. Even ordinary goods with some appeal were priced at 430,000 to 450,000. Retail stores were marking up prices by an additional 15% to 25%.

### Initial Silk Reeling Loans Estimated at 9 Billion Yuan

The silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces previously requested a loan of 84 billion yuan from the Joint Treasury for silk reeling, to be disbursed over four months, through the Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee, which has been approved. It has been learned that the loan will still be managed by the Farmers Bank of China. The order was issued to the Guidance Committee and the Farmers Bank of China yesterday by the Joint Treasury. It is also learned that the bank intends to start signing contracts tomorrow (the 16th) to meet the needs of the factories. The first allocation of funds, covering ten days of silk reeling expenses for each factory, is estimated to be around 9 billion yuan.

### Copper, Iron, and Glass Arrive from Europe

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Statenowickelan," managed by the Fulai Company, arrived in Shanghai last Saturday evening from Europe with a large shipment of copper, iron, and glass. The shipment included 1,847 cases of copper ingots. In addition, 4,300 bales of cotton were loaded in Mumbai. The vessel is currently docked at the Jianyuan Wharf for unloading. The copper ingots were purchased by the China Copper Casting Factory. The glass cannot be claimed immediately due to the lack of import permits. According to the company, not only does this shipment of glass lack import permits, but two previous shipments containing approximately 3,000 to 4,000 cases have been held for over three weeks due to the lack of permits.

### Bank Association Members Have Many Proposals for the General Meeting

The 14th General Meeting of the Bank Association members is scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month. In recent days, member banks have submitted numerous proposals, mostly concerning business operations and expenses. Today (the 15th) is the deadline for submitting proposals. The Association, in order to gather ideas from all sources, will accept written proposals from members even if they are submitted after the deadline. In addition to discussing the proposals from the members at the general meeting, the main agenda will be the revision of the banking industry regulations, the main contents of which are: (1) Defining banking operations in accordance with current banking laws and regulations. (2) Providing detailed definitions for important documents and operational procedures, referencing current laws and regulations as well as established practices, while ensuring the security of operational procedures. (3) Hoping that all banks will standardize the documents and procedures used in their operations as much as possible. According to this plan, the regulatory proposal will be reviewed by the Board of Directors and Supervisors this week before the meeting, and will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for filing after being approved by the general meeting.

### Fuel Management Committee Holds Regular Meeting to Discuss Coal Allocation Methods

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Industrial Association believes that the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal to factories has historically been channeled through the Coal Merchants Association before being distributed to the factories for consumption. As a result, there is a lack of understanding of the actual coal needs of each factory. The Industrial Association, on the other hand, is more familiar with the situations of each factory. It has been learned that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Fuel Management Committee, and the Industrial Association will hold a meeting of the Civil Industry Coal Allocation Review Group at the Social Affairs Bureau this Thursday to discuss how to improve coal allocation methods and to jointly find a solution.

[Another Report] Regarding the 500,000 US dollar quota of coal for the second quarter, the Fuel Management Committee is considering purchasing some coal from South America at the request of various manufacturers and distributing it to the factories for use.

### Metals are Sluggish

Metal prices are sluggish again, with weak out-of-town sales and low retail demand. This is a common phenomenon during the "May barren, June empty" period every year.

### Unified Bonds Rise While Foreign Shares Decline

Yesterday, due to speculation that the economy would improve, renewed buying interest caused government bonds to rise. Unified C bonds opened at 7,000 yuan in the morning, and the prices of the 360 series, 533 series, and 550 series of Runde bonds all increased, rising to 8,100 yuan. There was some supply of the 552 series bonds, and the price hovered around 7,700 yuan at the end, with about 3 million yuan worth of transactions. Compared to last Saturday, the prices of A, B, and C bonds each rose by 900 yuan, and the prices of D and E bonds also rose by 1,000 yuan.

Yesterday, foreign shares saw some profit-taking and selling, with rumors of increased US aid to China. Guangzhou banks, foreign banks, and the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank were all selling. The Ewo Cotton Spinning Company opened at 79,000 yuan in the morning and gradually fell to a low of 74,000 yuan at the close. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the share prices of the Ewo Cotton Spinning Company, Guangzhou Ewo, Beer, Steel, Telephone, and Reclamation companies each fell by 10%, while the share prices of the Paper and Shipping industries fell by 5%. The share prices of the British Union and Jardine Matheson companies saw slight decreases.

### Money Exchange Association Discusses Strengthening the United Reserve Fund and Expresses Opinions on Business Tax Issues

[Report from Our Newspaper] The 18th meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors of the Money Exchange Association was held yesterday afternoon at the Association, chaired by Chairman Shen Rixin. It is reported that discussions were held on the proposal to strengthen the organization of the United Reserve Fund for the money exchange industry, as well as the issue of special business tax.

[Another Report] According to people in the money exchange industry, the government is planning to levy a special business tax on the financial industry, with a tax rate of 4% on revenue (i.e., gross profit), which is considered a heavy burden. Moreover, current operating expenses in the financial industry are substantial, including various management, business, wear and tear, depreciation, donations, assessments, and other expenses. It is unfair to levy taxes on gross profit before deducting these expenses.

### Taiwan Fertilizer Company's Production Volume Increases Significantly

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 14th] The current production volume of the various plants affiliated with the Taiwan Fertilizer Company has exceeded the highest production volume before the retrocession of Taiwan. Plant No. 1 is expected to produce 12,000 tons of calcium cyanamide and 3,000 tons of calcium carbide this year. Plant No. 2 is expected to produce 16,800 tons of superphosphate and 430 tons of concentrated sulfuric acid. Plant No. 3 is expected to produce 25,200 tons of superphosphate and 1,070 tons of concentrated sulfuric acid. Plant No. 4 is expected to produce 1,080 tons of calcium carbide and 145 tons of electrodes. Plant No. 5 is expected to produce 261 tons of calcium carbide and 550 tons of electrodes.

According to Tang Yuanji, General Manager of the Company, the entire province's fertilizer needs can be met within approximately three years. The current implementation plan is divided into two steps: (1) Additional equipment will be installed in Plant No. 1, and the necessary materials are being purchased in the United States. If there are no other obstacles, the expansion project will be completed next year, achieving an annual nitrogen fertilizer production of 36,000 tons. (2) The construction plan for Plant No. 5 to complete a sulfuric ammonia plant with an annual production of 150,000 tons, which was left unfinished by the Japanese, will be expedited. (3) The construction plan for the former Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) to build a superphosphate plant with an annual production of 62,000 tons will be implemented.

### Rumors of Liquidation Fill the Market, and Rayon Prices Plummet

### Factory Merchants See Sluggish Transactions, and Silk Goods Are Also Scarce

Yesterday, the rayon market suddenly experienced a disastrous fall due to rumors of several thousand cases of rayon arriving at the port, creating a sense of panic in the market. The market opened with price declines, and No. 120 "High Mountain" lustrous rayon was first offered at 28,600,000 yuan. By noon, someone was willing to sell it for 28,200,000 yuan. The market further weakened in the afternoon, with the final selling price being 27,800,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,700,000 yuan compared to the end of last week. Other brands such as "Dongyang" and "Tianqiao" also decreased in price accordingly, with very few transactions.

Yesterday, the factory market was quiet, with all parties adopting a wait-and-see approach and an abundance of selling offers, resulting in soft prices. High-uniformity yarns were offered at 500,000 yuan less than the end of last week, with medium-grade yarn quoted between 30,000,000 and 31,000,000 yuan. Random lots of "Gan Jing" yarn were offered at 19,000,000 yuan, but there were no bids, and no transactions took place.

### Flour Sales Are Weak and Prices Decline

Yesterday, a total of over 5,200 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets, mainly glazed rice. Sales were sluggish, and the market was downstream. Both japonica and indica rice prices fell by 10,000 yuan. "Baiyuan" rice still had few buyers, and "Yinyuan" rice fell by over 10,000 yuan. Sales in the northern market were even more sluggish, and the decline was more severe. Both indica and japonica rice fell by over 10,000 yuan, and there were still few customers, making it difficult to be optimistic.

Merchants from Hubei and Hunan were also inquiring about yellow beans, raising prices by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. However, sales of Doutong yellow beans were not smooth, and prices fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and the situation remained a mix of firm and weak.

Sesame seeds were scarce and expensive, and prices were rising sharply, jumping by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Shelled peanuts sales were weak, and prices saw another sharp drop of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Red beans were being purchased by merchants from Hubei and Hunan, and prices rose by 10,000 yuan.

Both arrivals and sales of red sorghum were scarce, and the market was flat.

Both arrivals and sales of corn were weak, and prices were mediocre. In the oil market, merchants from Guangdong were purchasing rapeseed oil aggressively, causing prices to soar by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. The supply and demand of raw peanuts were balanced, and there were no temporary fluctuations. There was also little activity in the Qing oil market. Sesame oil sales were strong due to the summer season, and prices continued to rise by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, Qing oil market remained stable.

### Myanmar Rice Arrives Again

The rice ordered by the Central Trust Bureau from Siam arrived last week, totaling 17,000 tons. Myanmar rice also arrived, totaling over 29,300 tons.

### Tea Market Shows Strong Buying Interest

Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw strong buying interest in various grades of tea such as "Chou Zhen" and "Zhen Jian." However, sellers were more insistent on their prices than in the past, resulting in an overall supply shortage. Transactions were ordinary and unremarkable, but the trend was increasingly upward. Prices also showed an upward trend.

Various domestic sales of tea saw inquiries from local shops and merchants from other regions, and the situation was not desolate, with uniformly high prices. It is learned that there is an increasing need for rough black tea in the Lai Jing area. Negotiations are currently heated, but sellers are frequently raising prices, asking as much as 570,000 to 580,000 yuan per dan. Therefore, the gap between the buying and selling prices remains, and transactions have stalled. It remains to be seen whether a deal can be reached.

### Cigarette Market Declines

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with firm and stable sentiment, and there was a continuous buying of low-priced cigarettes. The price of ten-pack "British American Tobacco" cigarettes once rose to 8,900,000 yuan.

The goods to be exported include: (1) agricultural products such as brick tea and tung oil, and (2) mineral products such as tungsten and antimony. The Bureau plans to supply goods worth 10 million US dollars for barter trade this year and has submitted the plan to the Executive Yuan for record. Currently, the contract has not been signed due to unresolved issues such as freight costs. Once the contract is signed, the barter trade will be officially launched.

### First Batch of Petroleum from Kaohsiung, Taiwan Arrives in Shanghai, totaling 2,200 Tons

After receiving instructions from the Kaohsiung Petroleum Refinery in Taiwan, the China Tanker Company dispatched two tankers directly to Kaohsiung to transport the first batch of domestically produced petroleum to Shanghai. It is now reported that the two tankers have arrived in Shanghai, carrying a total of over 2,200 tons of domestically produced Kaohsiung petroleum, which will be allocated and sold to users by the China Petroleum Company. According to the person in charge of the China Petroleum Company, the Kaohsiung Petroleum Refinery resumed production and shipments last month.

### The Rising Trend of Chinese Shares is Blocked, and Yong Yarn's Spot Deferred Delivery Stock Drops to the Limit

Yesterday, the rise of Chinese shares was blocked due to the visit of U.S. General Wei to China and the increased hope for loans. After a long period of struggle, the market finally collapsed. Both spot and deferred delivery of Yong Yarn stock dropped to the limit. After the deferred delivery of Yong Yarn stock dropped to the limit, there were further decreases in the gray market, and younger investors No. 152 and No. 157 all increased their selling. Suddenly, there were rumors that trading in Yong Yarn stock would be suspended for a month. However, small stocks were relatively stable, and the new Rongfeng stock stood firm at the upper limit.

After the market opened in the morning, the deferred delivery of Yong Yarn stock immediately fell to 11,100 yuan. At this time, the Xinnuo, Meiya, and various small stocks such as Jingfu and Xinguang all had their own unique environments and were stable. The deferred delivery of Yong Yarn stock then rose to 11,300 yuan. No. 76 and others continued to sell, and it fell back to 11,050 yuan. Afterwards, the situation stabilized, and the price fluctuated around 11,100 yuan between 10:20 and 10:40 AM. After 10:50 AM, although domestic products No. 106 and No. 79 were listed at the upper limit, No. 162 (Guangzhou), No. 117, No. 89, No. 224, and No. 171 all increased their selling and fell back to 10,880 yuan. At 11:15 AM, No. 24 and No. 219 once rose to 11,000 yuan. However, credit conditions tightened, sellers flocked in, and the market immediately loosened. The news that there would be economic measures and that the Yong Yarn stock's capital increase would require a one-month market suspension further worsened the situation. The deferred delivery of Yong Yarn stock gradually fell to the 10,390 yuan limit. At 12:20 PM, the spot delivery of Yong Yarn stock also fell to the limit. After this, all stocks except Rongfeng, which remained at the upper limit, saw price declines. The gray market for deferred delivery of Yong Yarn stock was offered down to 10,070 yuan. No. 91 frequently increased its buying, raising the price to 10,200 yuan, and finally to around 10,150 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the price of Yong Yarn spot delivery stock fell to the limit, the price of Zhongfa fell by 45%, and the prices of the Xinnuo and Yonggong stocks fell by a little more than 10%. The prices of the Xinhua, Meiya, and Huafeng stocks each fell by a little more than 5% to nearly 10%. The prices of the Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing stocks each fell by a little less than 5%.

The Starving Province of Guangxi: People May Escape Hunger and Cold, but They Cannot Escape Disease

Guilin, 4th (Airmail) - Our reporter Liang Xiaozhong

The profound sorrow chokes me, rendering me speechless!

I can only tell you that after countless disasters and tribulations, Guangxi has once again fallen into the clutches of a major famine!

The unprecedented catastrophe in northern Guangxi last spring was something we tearfully appealed to our compatriots across the country about. But today, after so many people have shed their tears, another year has passed, and they are walking from death toward death.

### Save a Few More People, Give Them a Few More Days to Live

Quanxian County, the largest county in northern Guangxi, saw its disaster victims escape the shadow of death last year. Today, 85% of them are crying out in despair due to starvation. Starvation! That single word encompasses fourteen kinds of grass roots, six or seven kinds of tree bark, and even the kernels of hard-shelled fruits. Leaves that can be softened are consumed. Many people have died from poisoning as a result. In Xinjian, Xianshui, and other villages, corpses litter the ground, and bones fill the fields. It's heartbreaking to speak of! Please see the telegram sent by the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly to the relief sub-committee:

"I beg Director Huang (Ronghua) to embody the compassion of God and to consider the suffering of our compatriots. After the relief grain has run out, please provide extraordinary assistance so that a few more people can be saved from the realm of hungry ghosts and a few more days can be added to their lives on the line of death. This would be the virtue of Heaven, which cherishes life, and a blessing for future generations. I offer these words with tears; I beg for your merciful consideration!"

Each word is a tear, filled with immeasurable sorrow. After reading it, even I, as a reporter, cannot help but lament the cheapness of human life in these chaotic times! At this time last year, it was still possible to receive three to five catties of relief flour, allowing people to prolong their lives temporarily. But now, with the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) coming to an end, there is no hope of seeing even a single grain of flour again. Some would rather prepare to use the large quantities of remaining relief supplies for other "venues" than allow hundreds of thousands of people to live for a few more days. It's truly hair-raising to contemplate! In the early days of victory, when grief-stricken cries filled the fields, there were only three million disaster victims, accounting for one-fifth of Guangxi's total population.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] The Central Government, to assist in economic general mobilization, has specially established a Materials Regulation Advisory Committee within the Central Bank. It was originally planned for Zhang Jia'ao to serve as the chairman, but due to Zhang's busy schedule, it has been decided that Ren Qun will serve as the chairman. The committee will dispatch investigators to nine coastal cities, including Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Guangzhou. Zhang Jia'ao will come north to deploy personnel for the committee's work in North China. Mr. Zhang will depart for Tianjin tomorrow.

### US Foreign Policy Will Place More Emphasis on Asia; Lattimore Praises Marshall's Advocacy

[United States Information Service, Washington, 14th] Owen Lattimore, who served as an advisor to Chairman Chiang during the war, recently declared in a weekly column jointly sponsored by several American newspapers that the "Marshall Plan" for Europe was a development of an idea that the Secretary of State initially applied to the China problem.

Lattimore wrote that in the history of our relations with the rest of the world, this is the first time we have had a Secretary of State whose diplomatic doctrine emphasizes Asia even more than Europe. We are now entering a new stage of development in which our policies toward Asia and Europe seem more consistent than before, and Asia will command more of our attention than before.

Due to the acceleration of transportation, the closer coordination of world trade and economy, and the increased range and speed of strategic action, our Pacific and Atlantic borders now have a more mutually influential impact than before. We can almost say that it is a reasonable accident that a figure (referring to Marshall) has emerged to initiate this policy due to the need for a more consistent world policy. He was the first to think of the new shift in policy towards Asia.

Marshall's policy toward China established two principles that we are still following in China and have begun to apply to Europe under the "Marshall Plan." The first principle is that we will never be intimidated into delving so deeply into China that we lose our freedom of maneuver. The second is that we will never be intimidated into withdrawing from China so hastily that we do not have the option of re-entering.

Marshall's statement on China in January of this year should be read again and praised as an introduction to an idea that is also the basis for the European policy. In his statement on China, Marshall criticized those right-wing elements of the Kuomintang, letting them know that they could not use the pretext of preventing a coalition policy to coerce him into saving their skins; at the same time, he also criticized the extremists within the Communist Party, leaving himself plenty of room for maneuver, such as the army and navy training groups, making it clear that we would never abandon China to the Soviet Union and its friends because of threats.

When Marshall personally conducted mediation in China, the Chinese failed to reach a compromise. They can now all understand that neither side can knock the other down with one punch, and that a victory is impossible. The inevitable outcome is still compromise. The only question is whether the current leaders on both sides agree to compromise, or whether those willing to compromise will need to succeed them.

Although the Soviet Union has greatly publicized our weaknesses, it has not yet begun to act and replace us in China.

In China, compromise is still possible, and the result is the establishment of a united or federalized government. This result must be based on the premise that it must be deemed feasible by the Chinese themselves and must be related to the proportion of Chinese territory and power.

This idea is the essence of Marshall's plan for Europe. The degree to which Western and Eastern Europe are separated or merged remains to be decided by the Europeans. Marshall's attitude toward Churchill and the Western European bloc is like his attitude toward the Chinese Kuomintang: he will not allow them to order him to implement an Iron Curtain policy against the Soviet Union. His attitude toward countries controlled or organized by the Communist Party is like his attitude toward the Chinese Communist Party: he will not recognize their right to dictate "compromise" entirely on their own terms. His ability toward the Soviet Union, regarding European issues, is like regarding China, that he can agree to cooperate and also accept provocation.

### Minister Bai Discusses Current Affairs: The Northeast Must Be Defended with the Strength of the Entire Country; Reception of Lushun and Dalian Still Proceeds Through Diplomatic Channels

[Our Newspaper] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Nanjing, told reporters that although the siege of Siping has been lifted, the situation in the Northeast remains difficult. Because the Northeast is a national defense resource area, it must be defended with the strength of the entire country. The disasters from the Yuan and Qing dynasties originated in the Northeast. Judging from the current situation, protecting North China requires first defending the Northeast. The reception of Lushun and Dalian is currently proceeding through diplomatic channels. Regarding the situation in Xinjiang, the situation is complicated because it is not an internal problem. Since Maisud took over as chairman, he has implemented the principle of "Xinjiang people governing Xinjiang," which has been welcomed by most people, with only a few people with ulterior motives opposing it. There are a total of four million Uyghurs in Xinjiang, of whom more than three million support the central government's policies. When discussing general military issues, Bai said that the existing troops will be expanded, the self-defense forces of the people will also be strengthened, there will be no problem with the replenishment of weapons, and the principle of improving the treatment of soldiers has been determined, hoping to be equal to that of civil servants, and in order to boost morale, the basic living of soldiers must be guaranteed. Regarding the Weidmeyer Investigation Group's visit to China, Minister Bai declined to comment, only saying that he would talk in detail after meeting him. Weidmeyer was a friend in need to our country during the war and has always been sympathetic and friendly to us. I welcome his second visit.

### People in Guangdong and Guangxi Suffer Great Disasters, Compatriots from All Over Should Lend a Hand; Minister Bai and Others Host Shanghai's Various Circles

[Our Newspaper] Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaohong, and Huang Xuchu held a garden party at Huang Shaohong's residence on Linsen Middle Road at 5:00 PM yesterday to raise relief funds for the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi, and hosted various circles in the city. Attendees included Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiyu, Fang Zhi, Yan Huiqing, and more than a hundred people from Guangdong and Guangxi in Shanghai. Minister Bai said in his speech that the disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi is unprecedented in the past 30 years. Deputy Chairman Sun and others have already reported on it in the past, so I won't repeat it. Although China and the United Kingdom have already allocated funds for emergency relief, the country is limited by its financial resources, and I hope that all circles in Shanghai will provide more assistance. In the past century, the people of Guangdong and Guangxi have made major sacrifices and contributions in the history of the revolution. Today, they are suffering from this great disaster, and I sincerely hope that compatriots from all over will help them overcome their difficulties. At the same time, I, standing in the position of the Ministry of National Defense, hope that the great disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi will be relieved as soon as possible, so as to mobilize manpower and material resources to quell the internal strife. I wish the Guangdong and Guangxi Relief Association success. Deputy Chairman Sun then gave a speech, saying that the current problem is to concentrate efforts and raise huge sums of money. The government is already providing disaster relief, and I hope that compatriots from all over the country will assist. I would like to ask the leaders of all circles in Shanghai to study practical measures in the shortest possible time to mobilize all efforts for disaster relief. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the disaster victims of Guangdong and Guangxi. At 6:20 PM, Kong Xiangxi arrived. Bai Chongxi stepped forward to shake hands and said, "I came to Shanghai today specifically to welcome you." Then they sat at the same table and had a long conversation. (Kong's remarks can be found on the front page.) The garden party ended happily at 7:00 PM.

Chen told reporters that Vice Minister Dai Kui Sheng was dispatched to visit overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia before his death. Now I am dispatched to visit again, and Chairman Jiang has also entrusted me with a letter of condolences to take with me, which shows the Central Government's concern for overseas Chinese.

### Singapore Deported 17 Overseas Chinese for the Second Time, Escorting Them to Hong Kong

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 13th] Seventeen overseas Chinese were deported by the Singapore government on the 13th. They were escorted to the Dutch ship Wanfushi under heavy guard. The ship will sail to Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 3rd. Some police authorities explained the reason for deporting these 17 people, believing that they were related to the crime of riot. The names of the 17 people have not yet been announced. Since the restoration of the Singapore Civil Government last year, the above-mentioned 17 people are the second batch to be deported. The first batch, totaling 12 overseas Chinese, were deported in April last year.

### Proposed Legislation to Discriminate Against Foreign Nationals in Various Countries

Overseas Chinese Closely Monitor

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 13th] A reporter has recently learned that the Siamese government parties have announced a split on the matter of drafting legislation that discriminates against foreign nationals in various countries (especially overseas Chinese). The bill is similar to the anti-Chinese bill passed by the previous cabinet. The bill advocates that only Siamese people be allowed to live in certain provinces. The bill was proposed by Asa Bao, a member of the Cooperation Party, and is expected to be discussed in parliament next week. It is rumored that the proposer of the bill has requested the support of the Cooperation Party and the Constitutional Front Party, but both parties have refused. Therefore, Asa and another member have stated that they will withdraw from the Cooperation Party. Overseas Chinese here are closely monitoring the development of the bill in parliament, but they believe that the bill will not be passed, as the bill violates the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship.

### Tungsten Ore Smuggling Is Rampant in Guangdong; Rumor That a Certain Country Is Secretly Purchasing

The Ministry of National Defense Sent Personnel to Guangzhou to Investigate and Handle

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 14th] The trend of smuggling tungsten ore exports here is becoming increasingly rampant. It is rumored that merchant ships from a certain country are mooring in the vicinity of Macau and Dapeng Bay, secretly purchasing large quantities. The price is HK$380 per hundred catties, which is far from the official price of HK$31 per hundred catties. Therefore, in recent days, smugglers have become even more unscrupulous. Their smuggling routes: on the Dongjiang side, they mostly pass through Huiyang, Boluo, Bao'an, and exit to Macau; on the Beijiang side, they are transshipped through Guangzhou to the Xijiang, mostly passing through Jiangmen, Yangjiang, and Meixian to go to sea, and are mostly escorted by armed forces. The Ministry of National Defense has now sent personnel to Guangzhou to investigate and handle the matter, and it is reported that a portion of the smugglers have been detained.

### Xinjiang Hui Muslim Grand Ahong Ai Baidula and Others Arrive in Nanjing

Processing Exit Procedures for Pilgrimage to the Holy Land

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Xinjiang Hui Muslim Grand Ahong Ai Baidula and his party recently arrived in Nanjing to process exit procedures for pilgrimage to the Holy Land. It is reported that there are 200 Hui Muslims from various provinces making the pilgrimage this year, who will all come to Nanjing one after another. However, the pilgrimage special ship is scheduled to depart from Jeddah. With the time approaching, the Hui Muslims eagerly hope that the government will approve foreign exchange as soon as possible, as the pilgrimage is not only a religious ritual, but also has important relations with international politics. In recent years, a certain country has often provided assistance to Hui Muslims making pilgrimages in Xinjiang and other places, which has greatly affected the Hui Muslim's sense of belonging. It is rumored that a special plane will be sent to escort them again this year. Last year, the Hui Muslims missed the deadline due to the cumbersome exit procedures for pilgrimage, which was very disappointing. This year, they all hope that our government can thoroughly understand and attach importance to it and provide convenience.

### Soviet Troops First Remove Equipment, Then Communist Troops Destroy It; The Essence of the Northeast Is Almost Completely Destroyed; The Time to Achieve New China's Construction Is Greatly Affected

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 14th] The Central Daily News here published an article by Sun Yueqi entitled "Please Look at the Destruction of the Northeast by the Chinese Communists" in the Sunday essay column on the 13th, detailing the destruction of the essence of the Northeast by the Communist bandits after the Soviet army removed industrial equipment, electricity, cement, and steel worth approximately US$2 billion in the Northeast over the past year.

In his article, Mr. Sun cited the report of the Northeast Japanese Overseas Liaison Office, "Investigation Report on Damage to Northeast Industrial Facilities During the Soviet Army's Stationing," which is roughly consistent with the figures presented by Pauley, stating: "Of the 2.04 million kilowatts of power generation equipment in the Northeast, 1.3 million kilowatts were dismantled by the Soviet army, and 300,000 kilowatts were destroyed by the Communist troops. The two combined have destroyed 80 percent. Of the nine iron-smelting furnaces in Anshan, the six newer ones have been dismantled by the Soviet army one after another, and the remaining one has been destroyed by the Communist bandits. The newest steel-smelting and steel-rolling equipment, such as rail-rolling machines and train-wheel machines, have all been dismantled. The remaining equipment has only one-tenth of its original production capacity."

In his article, Mr. Sun recounted that before the Communist bandits launched a full-scale disturbance in the Northeast, the remaining industrial equipment in the Northeast could still save the current domestic industrial crisis. He stated: "The Northeast has suffered great calamities, and most of its important essence has been lost. However, due to its wealth and long-term management, the remaining scale is still the largest in the country. In October 1946, the Resources Committee handled industrial and mining enterprises in the Northeast. At that time, the government in the area had a total power generation capacity of over 389,000 kilowatts, accounting for 60 percent of the total power generation in China and Taiwan. The coal mine suffered heavy losses, but it still has equipment with an annual output of 6 million tons, one and a half times the production capacity of the Kailuan Coal Mine. With a little supplement, it is not difficult to produce 10 million tons. Although the remaining steel equipment is old, it can still reach a production of 200,000 tons within one year if repairs are carried out according to the planned schedule. It can be increased to 420,000 tons in 1948, which can supply the country's needs. As for cement, only the five factories of Xishui, Yangyang, Benxi, and Xiaotun in Anshan remain, but their output is greater than that of the factories in Guannei. Therefore, the Northeast has not lost its importance in revitalizing and building a new China and making it a decisive force for peace in the Far East and the world, and is valued by the Chinese people and the world, with unlimited expectations placed on it. It is believed that on this broken industrial base, if supplemented with Japanese reparations and a small amount of new equipment from abroad, it is still a strong capital for national construction.

The article concluded: "Unfortunately, after this calamity, the only remaining hope is like a flickering candle in the wind under the shroud of war. As soon as this place is relieved, that place is evacuated. Those who are lost are destroyed, and those who are not lost cannot work. The most serious source of power for the Northeast's important industrial and mining and all other enterprises, the Fengman Hydropower Plant, and the 360-kilometer-long 220,000-volt high-voltage transmission line, have recently been damaged everywhere and can hardly be used at all. It will take time and effort to repair in the future, which is even more fatal. This not only dispels people's hopes in the early days of victory, but also affects the time to achieve the construction of a new China, pushing back the industrialization of China by several years.

Wuxing: The Zhejiang Provincial Inland River Police Bureau stationed in this county recently received a provincial order to move to Jiaxing. All agencies and French consulates here believe that Wuxing is located near Taihu Lake, and if the defense is transferred, the bandit forces will inevitably rise again.

### The Soviet Attitude Towards the Lushun and Dalian Issue Does Not Surprise the Citizens of Changchun; Compatriots from Lushun and Dalian Demand Strong Negotiations

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] Regarding the Soviet Union's reply on the Lushun and Dalian issue, many people in Changchun are not surprised by this expected reply due to the Soviet Union's actions in the Northeast over the past two years. However, they all believe that the non-armed administrative reception is actually a sophistry and deception by the Soviet side, as the citizens of Changchun have not forgotten the 414 Incident caused years ago and the failure of the administrative reception in Harbin and Qiqihar. The Lushun and Dalian Compatriots Association, which has more than 100,000 members, held a meeting on the afternoon of the 13th to discuss the Soviet Union's reply on the Lushun and Dalian issue, and resolved to telegraph the government to demand strong negotiations.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] When a reporter asked Zhang Yuan, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whether there was a possibility of development on the Lushun and Dalian issue in the coming days, Zhang replied that he sincerely hoped that the Soviet Union could change its attitude on this issue.

### The 7,000-ton Guoxing Ship Was Sunk on the Jiangmian River in Pukou; Crew Rescued, Losses Nearly One Hundred Trillion Yuan

[Our Newspaper] The "Guoxing" ship of China Shipping Company (No. 9, 3rd Floor, Zhongshan East 2nd Road), with a total tonnage of about 7,000 tons, was leased by the Shipping Department of Shanghai Industrial Company and operated between Qingdao and various ports along the Yangtze River to transport edible salt. It has been in operation for two months. This time, it was transporting 3,970 tons of salt from Qingdao to Pukou for delivery. Due to the continuous rain in recent days, it could not be unloaded and has been moored in Pukou for nearly a week. At about 6:00 PM on the 13th, it was moved from Pier No. 4 to Pier No. 6 in preparation for unloading salt. Unexpectedly, near Pier No. 6, two sailboats suddenly sailed across the river. The ship urgently steered to avoid them, but the downstream current was very rapid, causing the third cabin in the middle of the ship's left side to crash violently into the bow of the China Merchants Bureau Hai'e ship moored at Pier No. 6, and it was immediately pierced. River water poured in and gradually sank. Fortunately, the sinking was slow, and the crew was rescued by nearby ships. All more than 100 people were able to escape, and the ship slowly sank into the water. By 6:00 AM yesterday (14th), it had completely sunk. The salt loaded on the ship this time was half official (Salt Affairs Bureau) and half commercial. Shanghai Industrial Company also had 2,800 dan, and the loss, including the ship's price, was nearly 100 trillion yuan. It was also found that the Hai'e ship of the China Merchants Bureau was also carrying 1,500 tons of salt from Tianjin to Pukou for delivery. Due to the rain, it had been delayed for many days. After being violently hit by the Guoxing ship, the bow of the ship was also slightly damaged. The captain of the Guoxing ship is named O. Andreassen, a foreigner, and the other Chinese captain is named Li. The shipping company is awaiting the reports of the two captains on the accident.
