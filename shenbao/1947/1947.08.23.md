### Chairman's Residence Hosts Symposium: Envoy Wei Criticizes China's Current Situation, Believing the Key Problem Lies in "Inept Governance"

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek invited approximately thirty individuals, including National Government Committee members in Nanjing, heads of various agencies, Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao, and National Government Chief Military Counselor Xue Yue, to a symposium at his Huangpu Road residence at 10 AM on the 22nd. The purpose was to introduce Envoy Wedemeyer to the attendees.

Chairman Chiang delivered an opening address, stating that Envoy Wedemeyer was a good friend of China and himself personally. Although his visit to China, mandated by President Truman, had only lasted a month, he had traveled extensively and gained considerable insights. He hoped that Wedemeyer could frankly critique China's current situation, offering valuable lessons and guidance for improvement.

Subsequently, Zeng Qi, a National Government Committee member from the Youth Party, spoke, emphasizing the late President Roosevelt's legacy of "indivisible world peace" and Secretary of State Stimson's "non-recognition doctrine" advocated during the "September 18th Incident." He stated that the former was a timeless truth, and the latter remained highly applicable today. He earnestly hoped that the United States would remember and steadfastly uphold these principles. Finally, he firmly declared that while China's current problems were indeed quite challenging, they were not insurmountable. He believed that the near future would reveal sufficient optimism.

Following this, Wedemeyer was invited to speak. With extreme frankness and honesty, he presented a completely truthful critique of China's current situation. The main point of his speech was "inept governance," asserting that while everything in China had the potential to be excellent, nothing ultimately achieved the desired results. The root cause, he argued, lay in the failure to fully utilize human resources.

Regarding the political sphere, he acknowledged that the current government had made some progress in attracting talent and improving efficiency compared to the past, but this progress was clearly insufficient.

In the economic sphere, he believed that China was rich in resources and wealth, but due to the neglect of resources and the hoarding of wealth, the current economic and financial situation was on the verge of bankruptcy. He cited examples to prove China's wealth, estimating that Chinese emigrants' assets in the United States amounted to approximately 1.5 billion yuan.

Concerning commerce, he stated that whether in domestic or international trade, the principle of equality must be strictly observed. Officials should not engage in commercial activities until they have resigned from their public office positions. He believed that if outstanding management talent could be discovered and the factories and mines in Taiwan and the Northeast restored to production, the economic and financial difficulties could be overcome smoothly.

In the military sphere, he believed that the treatment of soldiers was too poor. A soldier's monthly income and living standards were lower than those of a rickshaw puller, a situation that must be improved as quickly as possible; otherwise, it would be difficult to accomplish any mission swiftly.

He affirmed that the current strength of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was far greater than when he left China last April. However, from the government's perspective, the most effective countermeasure was to reflect internally and strive for self-improvement.

Finally, he praised Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's greatness, saying that Chairman Chiang's leadership and the support of the vast majority of the people were the guarantees of China's bright future.

After Wedemeyer concluded his remarks, Mo Dehui, a respected member of society and a National Government Committee member, and Jiang Yuntian, a political committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party, spoke in succession. Mo emphasized in particular that the Northeast was an inseparable part of China's territory and that China must fully fight for sovereignty over the Northeast, a position that would not be abandoned or compromised. Jiang stated that China's current situation was not overly serious and that China's future remained full of hope.

Finally, Chairman Chiang expressed his gratitude to Wedemeyer, and the meeting adjourned at 12 noon. The two-hour meeting was filled with an atmosphere of frankness, sincerity, friendship, and hope from beginning to end.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The American Embassy announced that General Wedemeyer visited Chairman Chiang at his Huangpu Road residence at 10:00 AM on the 22nd and, at the invitation of the National Government, attended a meeting of the National Government Committee. He departed at 12:15 PM to return to Ambassador Stuart's residence on Shanghai Road. In the afternoon, he held meetings with his advisors to handle official business. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, he hosted a cocktail reception invited by the mission.

### Wedemeyer Hosts Cocktail Party, Bidding Farewell to Chinese Leaders, Flying to Tokyo Tomorrow to Meet with General MacArthur

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Wedemeyer mission held a grand cocktail party in the living room and on the lawn of the Ambassador's residence on the evening of the 22nd to bid farewell to Chinese officials and dignitaries, as well as foreign envoys stationed in Nanjing.

Government leaders Zhang Qun, Yu Youren, Zeng Qi, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Wansheng, Yu Hongjun, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Yu Dawei, Bai Chongxi, Gu Zhenggang, Zhou Yichun, Li Minqi, Zhou Qianchong, Jiang Yuntian, Ye Gongchao, Dong XianGuang, renowned scholars Yu Bin, Wu Yifang, Luo Mengce, Chen Yuguang, foreign envoys and their families, totaling over a hundred people, were in attendance. Wedemeyer and Ambassador Stuart personally served as hosts. Wedemeyer expressed that he had gained much from this trip and extended his sincere gratitude for the assistance provided by all parties. The gathering ended happily at 9 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] U.S. Presidential Envoy General Wedemeyer is scheduled to leave China for Tokyo on the morning of the 24th. He will stay in Tokyo for one day on the 25th to meet with General MacArthur to discuss issues related to Japan and Korea. He will fly to Seoul on the 26th. According to a spokesperson for the mission, the group is expected to stay in Korea for about ten days. The itinerary and work plan in Korea will be determined after arriving in Seoul and consulting with U.S. authorities stationed in Korea.

[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The Wedemeyer Fact-Finding Mission has been extremely successful in gathering information.

Judging from various signs, Wedemeyer has also obtained a large amount of reports from the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. officials. His recommendations will remain confidential until they have been presented to President Truman. Wedemeyer can contribute three possible approaches to the U.S. policy towards China: (1) a complete "hands-off" policy, (2) intervention in the Chinese civil war by the United Nations, and (3) providing broad assistance to the internationally recognized National Government. Rumors are rife in diplomatic circles here that if Wedemeyer believes that U.S. aid is the best plan to adopt towards China, he will be appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to China and return to China. Chinese, American, and other parties unanimously agree that Wedemeyer is someone familiar with China and its problems and is qualified to supervise any U.S. aid program to China, which would have three objectives: (1) create a good government, (2) assist China's economic recovery, and (3) stop communism.

### National Election Budget Approved at 60 Billion Yuan

Tianjin Election Office Established Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The national election budget was initially drafted by the General Election Office and estimated at 90 billion yuan. After being submitted to the National Government for approval, the central government has now reduced it to 60 billion yuan to subsidize election offices at all levels across the country. The General Election Office has requested and received approval to allocate a portion of the funds in advance, to be directly requested by the respective election offices from the Ministry of Finance according to their actual needs.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The General Election Office announced on the 22nd that since the 19th, election offices in various locations have continued to report their establishment. Five offices have been established in Chahar, Guangxi, Nanjing, Ningxia, and Songjiang, bringing the total to 36.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 22nd] The Tianjin Election Office was established on the 22nd. Du Jianshi is the chairman. The committee members are the government representative and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Hu Menghua, from the Kuomintang, Xu Qia, from the Youth Party, Zhu Dewu, and from the Democratic Socialist Party, Cao Youyi. It was decided that voter registration will be open until September 5th, and voter announcements will be processed from the 25th to the 10th.

### Symposium on National Reconstruction Donation: Consensus Favors Targeting Wealthy Households, Location Should Not Be Nationwide to Avoid Increased Disturbance

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] An expanded symposium to discuss the levying of a national reconstruction donation was held at the International Social Center here at 3 PM on the 22nd. Attending People's Political Councilors, Legislative Yuan members, and the speakers of the Nanjing and Shanghai city councils spoke one after another. They unanimously agreed that the wealthy should enthusiastically contribute money during this period, but the target should be mainly high-ranking officials and should not extend to the middle class or below, to avoid disturbing the people. After two hours of lively discussion, there was general agreement that the starting point for the levy should be raised to around 50 billion, and it should be limited to major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Kunming, and Chengdu, rather than nationwide, to minimize harassment. Tax targets should also be mainly natural persons, not legal entities. As for whether real estate should be levied, it was believed that the super-rich with 50 billion in assets should have cash to pay, so it would still be included in the assessment. After today's discussion, the National Overall Economic Council will use this as a principle to formulate another plan and find ways to start levying the donation in the short term.

Today's symposium was convened by Wang Yunwu, Shao Lizi, and Wu Tiecheng. Attending were Shanghai City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Nanjing City Council Speaker Chen Yuguang, People's Political Councilors Wu Chunwu, Wu Zhaoxu, and Yin Shuxian, as well as Legislative Yuan members Di Ying and Chen Ruxuan, and National Overall Economic Council members Yu Hongjun, Bai Chongxi, Chen Lifu, Chen Qitian, and Zuo Shunsheng, totaling about fifty people. Wang Yunwu first gave a speech, explaining the reasons for convening the symposium. Yu Hongjun then reported on the drafting process of the proposed national reconstruction donation plan, saying that the purpose of this new donation was to get the wealthy to contribute money to make up for the shortage of state treasury revenue and to quell the public outrage of the general public. However, this matter had many technical difficulties. To gather opinions from all sides, this symposium was held to solicit opinions from all aspects, so as to avoid technical flaws, disturb the middle class, and have counterproductive phenomena. After Yu's speech, the participants spoke one after another, with most arguing that the tax on property should target the super-rich. Di Ying, Xue Mingjian and others argued that it would be better to rectify old taxes than to create new ones.

Wu Chunwu was the first to speak, believing that the technical difficulties that will arise in organizing property donations were not a major issue, and the main key was whether the government has the sincerity and determination. The current government is a revolutionary national government and should seek welfare for the people through revolutionary means. The government should not be too partial to a few wealthy people. The government has not failed to organize grain collection and conscription because the population has not been clearly investigated, so why is it using this as an excuse for collecting property donations? Wu pointed out that the government has various ways to prevent wealthy households from evading taxes. If they underreport, the government can buy it up. If they hide and do not report, it can be confiscated. If they break it up into smaller amounts, they can be based on the family. Changing names can also be thoroughly investigated. Tax authorities have rich experience. Those who have no money can still be made to contribute money, but there is no way to deal with those who have money, is it not a strange thing?

Di Ying and Xue Mingjian spoke in succession, pointing out that it is better to rectify old taxes than to establish new taxes. It is not worth killing the chicken to get the eggs. Xue pointed out that the population of Wuxi is less than one million, and its unified tax on industrial mines has reached 425 million, an average of 425,000 yuan per person, is this not shocking?

People's Political Council member Yin Shuxian believed that before discussing this issue, we must first clarify its nature. If it is collected based on financial reasons, it will only increase disturbance, and he does not approve of it. If it is collected for political reasons, so that the wealthy and those who make a fortune by speculation pay taxes, then he expresses his agreement. He also pointed out that some Chinese people live too extravagantly abroad, causing controversy, and should be heavily taxed. If 200 households can be targeted, with each household levied 1 billion, that would be enough, and it should not be levied on the middle class to increase trouble. Lu Qian proposed a new term, advocating that the use of the new donation tax should be announced to the world. At this point, Shanghai City Speaker Pan rose and gave a speech on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai, detailing the pros and cons (see separate article). Nanjing City Council Speaker Chen Yuguang also spoke on behalf of the capital, believing that taxation should start with rectifying old taxes, and hoped that it would not be a case of draining the pond to get all the fish, allowing those in charge to muddy the waters. He advocated that the national reconstruction donation can be held in stages, with the first phase starting at 50 billion and decreasing thereafter. People's Political Council member Wu Zhaoxu advocated using revolutionary means to "choose the fat and bite," and the name should be patriotic donation. However, he did not approve of holding it nationwide at the same time to avoid disturbing the people. He believed that it can be handled in Shanghai, Kunming, Chengdu and other places, and that overseas Chinese are suffering abroad and should not be levied on property donations again.

Legislative Yuan member Zhou Yizhi raised an opinion on the time of collection, arguing that since it is named the National Reconstruction Donation, it should be collected after the end of the war for the purpose of national reconstruction. As for the starting point for the levy, Zhou also advocated raising it to 5 billion or 10 billion, and raising the tax rate to 50% or 100%. Finally, he also hoped that the currency system would be reformed as soon as possible to reduce various strange phenomena. Chen Ruxuan suggested changing the name to "Freedom Donation," and when implementing it, the target should be the super-rich, who should be forced to pay. Peng Chunshi made a passionate argument, believing that in the current situation, since there is no way to operate on certain people, what is the use of this harsh ordinance?

After the participants finished speaking, Wang Yunwu summarized the opinions of all parties and made a conclusion. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM.

### Dalian Port Temporarily Closed: Executive Yuan States It Is Not a "Blockade": Foreign Ships Must Obtain Chinese Permission to Dock

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Executive Yuan issued the following statement on the order to temporarily close Dalian Port on the 22nd: (1) Recent reports stating that the Executive Yuan had ordered the "blockade" of Dalian Port do not correspond to the facts. The original wording of the order was "temporarily closed," not "blockaded." (2) After this order is issued, any foreign ships intending to dock at Dalian Port must first obtain the permission of the Chinese government. (3) Regardless of whether Dalian Port is open or not, no foreign ships may engage in coastal trade in China.

### Prominent Figures from All Walks of Life in Shanghai Send Memorandum to Envoy Wei, Delivered to the Envoy in Person in Nanjing by Speaker Pan for Forwarding

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Shanghai Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan was invited to the U.S. Embassy at 3:30 PM on the 22nd to speak with Ambassador Stuart. Pan personally delivered a memorandum to Wei De Meyer, requesting him to forward it. The memorandum was jointly signed by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council and people from industry, commerce, education, and cultural circles. Pan left the embassy about half an hour after speaking with the Ambassador.

[Local News] During Envoy Wei De Meyer's visit to China to conduct an investigation, he visited various places and came to Shanghai three times. Due to the urgency of the schedule, he came and went in a hurry, so most prominent figures did not have the opportunity to contact him or state their views. Now that Envoy Wei De Meyer's mission is about to be completed and he is about to return home, some leading figures from the cultural, educational, financial, industrial, and commercial circles of this city have specially gathered on their own initiative and jointly sent a memorandum to Envoy Wei De Meyer to express their views. There is a Chinese version and an English version of the memorandum. The night before, Shanghai Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan took it to Nanjing. Yesterday, Pan personally visited Ambassador Stuart Leighton, when he delivered the letter to the Ambassador, requesting him to forward it to Envoy Wei De Meyer. The full text is extracted as follows:

To General Wei De Meyer and Members of the Investigation Group:

Gentlemen, you have traveled across the ocean to visit our country. In the summer heat, you have been working tirelessly, travelling for a month. Your thorough consultations and sincere feelings are reminiscent of the days when our comrades-in-arms fought side by side in the battlefields of India and Burma. We, who work in or near Shanghai, the political, economic, and cultural center of our country, including major figures from the cultural, educational, economic, financial, industrial, commercial, and religious sectors, are more aware of the crux of our country's affairs and the suffering of our people in recent years. We originally planned to make a statement when you visited Shanghai, and to provide consultations. However, due to the hurried schedule and limited time, some of us only attended banquets, while others did not even receive your instructions. We all regret not having the opportunity to express our innermost feelings. Now, as you have completed your visit and are about to draft a report and leave China, we would like to offer three suggestions for your attention.

When we review Sino-American relations today, we must not forget the merits of your late President McKinley. International assistance to those in need will eventually bear good fruit. The increasingly deep Sino-American relations over the past forty years can serve as a powerful proof. Moreover, since the war, China and the United States have been allies and have shared common hardships, which is different from ordinary diplomatic relations. Furthermore, the degree of friendship between Japan and your country cannot be compared. Therefore, it is natural for our country to appeal to your country for assistance in times of urgency and distress, and it is also within the expectations of your country's government and people. After your four weeks of personal visits, you will be able to understand the legitimacy and urgency of this appeal. How to understand our country's actual needs and the wishes of the people, and make a decision that is incumbent upon you, is the main task before you. We firmly believe that the public-spirited American people will continue to ensure the gains of your late President McKinley, in addition to engaging in commerce, missionary work, and education in China, and further promote its former glory, and lay the foundation for the two countries to continue to work together to stabilize the situation in the Far East. Then your trip will be worthwhile. This is the first point to pay attention to.

Secondly, our country has suffered the longest war, made the greatest sacrifices, and suffered the deepest trauma, as the world knows. After the victory, we were just about to take a breath, but unfortunately, domestic wars broke out again, followed by frequent border alerts. You have personally visited Northeast and Mongolia, and I believe you have heard and seen something. We have thoroughly reviewed all of this, and we cannot deny the shortcomings of human governance, but the international factors cannot be denied either. Since the Yalta Conference, the international struggle between power and justice, slavery and democracy, seems to have its own boundaries. Since the precedent has been set, the dynamic situation in some countries today is almost an inevitable consequence, and our country has unfortunately suffered its consequences. Intensifying the situation is a natural evolution and also an accurate fact. The Sino-Soviet Treaty carries on the legacy of the Yalta Conference and is entrusted to the peaceful and compromising beliefs of your late President Roosevelt and our Chairman Chiang. Even if our country has made some sacrifices, we should abide by it unswervingly. However, the Nine Eastern Provinces are the territory of China, and the exercise of sovereignty should not be hindered or infringed upon in any form or in name. Otherwise, the blood of the Chinese people's resistance will be shed in vain. If the Soviet Union can deliberately delay or violate the Sino-Soviet Treaty due to any excuse other than the treaty, then the dignity of the treaty will not exist, and will future international treaties, including the signing of peace treaties with former enemies, not cause more trouble? And the inability to maintain international credibility is directly or indirectly related to this treaty. Obviously, this was not what your late President Roosevelt expected. What is the remedy for a lost cause? Your country also has a moral responsibility, and the absurd proposal that is circulating outside that China should give up the Northeast and divide the border for governance is definitely not something the Chinese people can tolerate. This is the second point to pay attention to. (The following text continues on page 2)

### Chinese and British Authorities Negotiate to Prevent Smuggling in South China: Measures to Crack Down to Be Announced Soon

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to senior customs officials, negotiations between China and the United Kingdom to crack down on smuggling from Hong Kong have gone through three stages. Initially, the Kowloon Customs Commissioner and the Hong Kong government conducted preliminary consultations. Subsequently, Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao personally went to Hong Kong for negotiations and reached a broad understanding on the general issue of smuggling in South China. In the third stage, London became particularly concerned about this matter, and the focus of the negotiations shifted to Nanjing. The British Embassy is now discussing the details with relevant Chinese ministries. Detailed measures on how to eliminate smuggling centered on Hong Kong will be announced soon. What can be said at present is that in the past, our country could only crack down on smuggling around Hong Kong, but in the future, we can send people to Hong Kong to combat smuggling, and its effectiveness will be incomparable. Moreover, since the foreign exchange adjustment, overseas remittances have had a legitimate outlet. In the past, because the official price and the black market were too far apart, merchants did not hesitate to take risks to smuggle. Since the announcement of foreign exchange trading prices, reports received here have proven that the smuggling situation in South China has eased slightly. As far as the various regions of the country are concerned, there are only sporadic smuggling incidents in the coastal areas, and no large-scale illegal activities have been discovered recently. Sometimes, ships carrying returning overseas Chinese from Korea also carry some goods. It was originally intended to strictly prevent this, but the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that overseas Chinese should be given considerable preferential treatment, so it has not been further investigated. In addition, smuggling is not a criminal offense in law. Even if a large-scale smuggling case is uncovered, at most the goods will be confiscated. Because it is too lenient, it is not enough to have a deterrent effect. The competent authorities submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance six months ago, advocating that the "Regulations on the Punishment of Smuggling and Evasion of Customs Duties" be strictly enforced against smuggling. In this regulation, smugglers, regardless of nationality, are criminal offenders. It is now known that this regulation has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, but it has not yet been forwarded, so it cannot be enforced.

### Canadian Delegation Flies to Hong Kong Today to Return Home

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] General Crerar, head of the Canadian delegation to Japan, and his party are scheduled to leave Nanjing for Hong Kong on the morning of the 23rd to start their journey back to Canada. General Rooks, head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, hosted a luncheon for the entire delegation at 1:00 PM today.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Canadian Embassy held a cocktail party at 6:30 PM on the 22nd, where Ambassador Davis introduced General Crerar and others to the guests. Government leaders Bai Chongxi and Gui Yongqing, and envoys from various countries, Steven and Menon, and their families, totaling over sixty people, attended. The gathering ended happily at 7:30 PM.

### Analysis of the Merits and Demerits of Levying National Construction Donations: Speaker Pan's Earnest Plea, Hoping the Authorities Can Rectify Tax Collection Agencies

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] At the enlarged symposium on levying national construction donations held on the afternoon of the 22nd, Shanghai Municipal Assembly Speaker Pan Gongzhan deeply analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of levying property donations. Representing the citizens of Shanghai, he made an earnest plea, hoping for the rectification of tax collection agencies to prevent them from becoming self-enriching intermediaries. He believed that instead of starting the levy from ten billion yuan and including real estate, which would cause nationwide unrest, it would be more fair to negotiate with the Americans and first levy or borrow from Chinese people's deposits in the United States. This would also refresh the people's perception. Mr. Pan spoke generously today and cited various examples in Shanghai as proof. After Speaker Pan's speech, Finance Minister Yu and Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Direct Taxation Department, both stated that any tax personnel found to be engaged in corruption would be severely punished if evidence was found. Speaker Pan also cited facts as examples and was willing to bear the responsibility of providing evidence. The main points of Mr. Pan's speech are recorded as follows:

Mr. Pan first pointed out that the levy of property donations is of great importance. If handled well, it can help the national treasury and boost people's confidence. However, if handled improperly, it will not only fail to supplement revenue but also cause disturbances, resulting in more harm than good. Therefore, before the levy, issues such as the investigation methods, the target of collection, and whether to levy from legal entities in addition to natural persons should all be carefully considered. Now, I would like to share with you the opinions I have recently gathered from the Shanghai Municipal Assembly and business community.

First, whether the property donation can be successfully levied depends primarily on whether the financial authorities have the determination to rectify the tax collection agencies. In the recent standard tax inspection conducted in Shanghai, auditors often demand "percentages." Businessmen suffer losses but dare not speak out. Currently, it is said that the price is as high as one percent. This point can be reported to the Minister of Finance. If this phenomenon is not eliminated, then when property donations are levied in the future, the government will definitely receive less than those who are enriching themselves.

Second, whether the collection tools are adequate and effective is also worth considering. In Shanghai's profit tax process, after the account books are taken away by the auditors, an appointment is made to "talk" at Guanshengyuan Restaurant. What exactly is discussed is self-evident. Therefore, all tax collection agencies must be rectified. As for the target of collection, I support politically motivated levies, as this can refresh the people's perception and have the significance of redistributing wealth. However, when levying, natural persons should be the target, not legal entities. Under the current circumstances, very few companies, factories, or businesses have assets less than ten billion. If levies are added to legal entities, then none will be spared. As for levying on real estate, it is best not to levy on all real estate, as Shanghai rents are very high and most of them are pocketed by intermediaries. Now, let me tell you a heartbreaking story. A widow in Shanghai has a three-bay storefront on the main road, and the estimated value of the property is over ten billion. The store is profitable due to its central location, but the widow's rental income is minimal, barely enough to support her family. So she filed a complaint in front of her property, lamenting her plight. If property is levied in the future, those with over ten billion will be taxed one or two percent. How can she afford this tens of millions of yuan in property donations? She will inevitably have to donate a corner of the house. Furthermore, starting the levy at ten billion yuan will absolutely not work. Currently, prices have increased to 30,000 times pre-war levels. Should someone with 33,300 yuan before the war be considered a wealthy person? This point is worth considering. I hope that after the property donation is levied, small fish are not caught in the net while large fish are not caught at all, or even because the net opening is not large enough, the large fish cannot enter the net. As for levying on the wealthy, there are many Chinese people with foreign exchange deposits abroad, and it is said that the list is known to some. Why not announce it immediately? Since the government lacks foreign exchange, why not start the property tax levy from this source? In the past, some said that foreigners were unwilling to announce the names of depositors, but today, American businessmen in China are deeply dissatisfied with Chinese people's deposits in the United States. It is said that Wedemeyer also raised this point with our government. Why don't we take this opportunity to make a counter-request? If foreigners are willing to help, they can first announce the list, which will benefit our collection. If not levied, borrowing is also acceptable. Since our country has borrowed from foreigners, there is no reason why we cannot borrow from our own people. If we do not plan for this and are preoccupied with catching small fish, causing nationwide unrest, how can this be considered fair?

Third, regarding the collection agencies, according to the collection plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance, there are reporting agencies, evaluation agencies, supervisory agencies, and collection agencies. Before the donation and tax are collected, agencies are first established, and there are many titles. How much will be collected in the future is still unknown, but the expenses will be in the thousands upon thousands. All provinces and cities have financial departments and bureaus, which are branches of the central government. Why not utilize them instead of establishing new organizations? The property donation is levied to meet the central government's needs, not to support the agencies.

Fourth, the original plan has provisions for rewarding whistleblowers. All of this will only cause more disturbances, and there is no need to set them up separately.

### Major Annihilation War Launched in Southern Henan: National Army Recovers Xiangcheng and Advances Rapidly Day and Night; Joint Land and Air Forces Tighten Encirclement

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch of the 22nd] A major annihilation war has been launched in southern Henan. On the 21st, the National Army north and south of the Shaying River recovered Xiangcheng. After Shenqiu, they advanced rapidly towards Runan and Xincai in separate routes day and night. On the 21st, the Liu bandit's 1st and 7th Columns attempted to flee west of the Pinghan Railway but were intercepted by the National Army in the area east of Queshan and Zhumadian. Unable to withstand the attack, they turned back and fled. Currently, National Army troops along the Pinghan Railway are arriving in a steady stream with strong forces. On the 22nd, the joint land and air forces of the National Army tightened the encirclement of the Liu bandit's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns, which had fled and occupied the triangular area of the Honghe and Runan rivers from the northeast, west, and south.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch of the 22nd] Liu Bocheng's main force, passing through southern Henan, arrived at Zhengyang, with the vanguard approaching the Pinghan Railway. According to military observers, the Dabie Mountains lack food, and their proximity to the Yangtze River makes them vulnerable to encirclement and annihilation. It is highly unlikely that Liu's troops will flee there. Observing their escape route, they are bound to flee into the Tongbai Mountains, hoping to replenish and prolong their existence. The local Eighth Route Army units led by Wei Fenglou and Li Renlin are still harassing the north bank of the Shaying River. The National Army is currently seeking to annihilate their main force.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 21st] The remnants of the Liu Bocheng bandit gang, the 1st and 6th Columns, totaling more than 18,000 men, fled from Xiangcheng to Longkouji, 40 miles north of Xincai, on the night of the 19th. A nearby unit fled to Wanjindian, 60 miles southeast of Runan, on the morning of the 20th, and continued to flee to the vicinity of Handong, 30 miles southwest of Wanjindian, in the afternoon. Another unit of about 5,000 men fled to Anji, 30 miles south of Shangshui, at dawn on the 20th, and continued to flee to Baigumiao, more than 20 miles east of Shangcai, at noon. The 2nd Column, after fleeing south from Shenqiu, has now arrived in the Linquan and Taihe areas. The main force of Wei Fenglou's bandit troops is cooperating with a unit of Liu's bandits in the vicinity of Zhoujiakou, seemingly to cover Liu's southward escape. Observing the bandit situation in the border area of Henan and Anhui in recent days, it is still undecided how Liu Bocheng's bandit troops, who are struggling desperately like trapped beasts, will break free from the National Army's encirclement to prolong their existence. The National Army is closely monitoring the situation.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch of the 22nd] The bandits in southern Shanxi are stepping up their efforts to support the Liu bandits fleeing in Henan and continue to move south. The 22nd Brigade fled from Anyi to Zhangmao Avenue. The communist bandits in Wenxi are also moving south in the same direction. The 23rd Brigade fled from Anyi to Yangcheng. The so-called "Democratic Allied Army" 55th Division fled and arrived at Yuanqu. The areas left behind by the various bandit units are being taken over by the bandit's independent regiments and local armed forces.

### Recovery Work Unfolds in the Jiaoji Railway Recovery Area; Remnant Bandits Cleared Between Jiaxiang and Yuncheng in Western Shandong

[Our Jinan Dispatch of the 22nd] In the two newly recovered areas of the western section of the Jiaoji Railway, recovery work has been actively launched.

### Memorandum to the German Envoy from Prominent Figures in Shanghai, Continued from Page 1

Furthermore, we believe that due to differing traditions of Eastern and Western civilizations and varying levels of political sophistication, a political system of any "coalition government" clinging to the form of political parties may not be the best way to address our country's current crisis. You are also aware that the continued class representing the majority of our people is where the core strength of true free individuals lies. This class cannot be represented by any party or professional politician. This group has collaborated with revolutionaries to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and Hongxian's imperial regime, participated in the National Revolution of the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China to eliminate warlords and corrupt officials, and pioneered the path of democratic politics in our country. They have spared no effort to rise up united and fight alongside our American and British allies to achieve victory. However, you also know that the ancient sayings, "A gentleman is ashamed to speak of profit and honor," and "A gentleman associates widely but does not form factions," are still followed by the majority of our people. The "Chinese coalition government" in the minds of people in your country's government and public seems to be a "coalition government" jointly organized by various parties (parties with a developed party system), believing that this can solve all difficulties. However, today, our country's political development is still in its infancy, and there are few with foresight and political strategies and policies sufficient to shoulder heavy responsibilities and overcome difficulties. Therefore, such parties are still largely limited by reality, only knowing how to maneuver, and may not each have distinct political programs to adhere to. If a "coalition government" is formed by such parties, it will not be considered representative of the majority of the people. If you continue to adhere to the usual practices of Western party politics, ignore the opinions and efforts of the majority of free individuals in our country, and mistakenly believe in any "coalition government" that emphasizes form over substance, without considering how to enable the government to gain the support of the majority of good people in our country, then you may still have regrets in solving our country's pressing problems. This is the third point that should be noted.

We deeply believe that your trip will be successful. Given the close relationship between China and the United States, your report of the facts after returning home will greatly help our government and people in addressing the current crisis and laying the foundation for recovery. We deeply believe that world prosperity and world security are inseparable. The urgent efforts of our people today are completely the same as the hopes of your people for us, namely: (1) stabilizing currency values, (2) revitalizing rural areas, (3) promoting economic and international trade, (4) restoring transportation and local order, and (5) providing guarantees sufficient to safeguard world collective security and the sanctity of treaties. All of this will depend on the sympathy and assistance of you and your country's government and people. We are well aware that our country's economic policies for reconstruction and nation-building will move towards a free economic system that is in line with the Principle of People's Livelihood. This is not only expected by our friendly allies but also the historical desire of our people nationwide. Our government has repeatedly and solemnly stated that it sincerely welcomes international investment, which is evident to people both in China and abroad. In recent years, British and American merchants in China have inevitably developed some resentment due to occasional difficulties encountered in their own businesses. We believe that the existence of such unevenness will require time to correct: First, the general social and economic situation must be improved, so that some controls can be gradually lifted (these controls are actually inconvenient for both Chinese and foreigners alike). The recent moderate opening of the foreign exchange market is one example. Second, both sides must review and correct themselves automatically. Our government and people should be able to implement the spirit of a free economic system and eliminate all obstacles as much as possible. And our American, British, and other allied business people in China must also abandon some traditional concepts of the past century, face up to the requirements of our country's reconstruction, and, based on the understanding that should exist after the abolition of unequal treaties, engage in commerce and mutual benefit with the Chinese business community. We firmly believe that in the near future, our country will surely strive for innovation and have a firm and strong government that can truly represent the will of the people to faithfully implement this Principle of People's Livelihood free economic policy that meets the needs of the country and the people.

Furthermore, there is something else that must be told to you: International trade must involve mutual exchange of goods between each other in order to be permanently smooth and mutually beneficial. If foreign merchants operating in China only know how to sell foreign goods in China without engaging in assisting our country in increasing its export trade, then the accumulated trade deficit will inevitably block the gateway to Sino-foreign trade due to our country's lack of "US dollars." And who will suffer from this? In short, any suggestions from you, any technical, economic, financial, or spiritual assistance from your government or people, if they do not ignore the three points mentioned above and can respect Chinese sovereignty as a prerequisite, we firmly believe that it will be easy to obtain the welcome and cooperation of the majority of our people. Before parting, we respectfully present these points for your consideration, and we wish you all success in your mission, and we ask you to convey our gratitude and greetings from us and the citizens of Shanghai to President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, members of Congress, and the people of your country upon your return.

### Planning Shipping Routes in the Qiantang River Estuary, the Seawall Engineering Bureau Plans to Send Ships for Survey Next Month

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 22nd] Since the Tagu ocean liner ventured into Hangzhou Bay, passing through Biezimen and entering the Qiantang River, setting a new record, all parties have placed great hope on the opening of the Qiantang shipping route. Wang Huzhen, Deputy Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, recently personally inspected the channel and told reporters upon returning to Hangzhou that there is absolutely no problem in opening shipping routes to Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other places. The winds and waves along the way are actually smaller than in the open sea, and slightly larger ocean liners can sail directly without hindrance. Therefore, the most urgent issue to be resolved is the route. The Seawall Engineering Bureau will specially dispatch steamships starting next month to survey the depth in order to facilitate the entry and exit of ocean liners.

Also: It was previously rumored that American experts claimed that destroying the Zhelong and Erlong mountains on the Qiantang River would eliminate the Qiantang River flood. According to Wang, this was fabricated by those who do not understand modern geography. The fact that these two mountains are the exit of the Qiantang River is seen in Ming Dynasty historical records. Due to the changes of the sea and land, the Qiantang River's exit to the sea is no longer here today, so blasting the mountains has nothing to do with stopping the flood.

### Ten Counties in Zhejiang Report Disasters

Serious Drought Along the Shangtang River

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 22nd] Ten counties in Zhejiang have been hit by disasters this summer, including Shaoxing, Dongyang, Pujiang, and Yiwu, which have been hit by wind and rain; Ningbo and Ruian have been hit by insect plagues; Yongjia has been hit by both imperial insects and plagues; Shangyu and Longquan have been hit by floods; and Linhai has been hit by drought. The provincial government has forwarded the reports to the Executive Yuan, requesting disaster relief.

[Another dispatch] Provincial Governor Shen, accompanied by Deputy Director Wang of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, inspected the disaster situation along the Shangtang River. The land on both sides of the river for more than 20 kilometers was cracked. If there is no rain within seven days, there will be no harvest of grain. The water released from West Lake only flows a short distance out of Hangzhou City. Because the drought has been too long, it has been intercepted by nearby farmers and drained completely. Currently, in the Linping area, those who have dug ponds are using manpower to draw water to irrigate the farmland, which costs 300,000 for one acre. Rice fields are unable to afford this high price for irrigation and will be allowed to wither and turn yellow. Sugarcane fields need a lot of water, and they are buying water for irrigation. However, farmers are worried about what to do after the pond water is used up. In addition to the Seawall Engineering Bureau having three water pumps to pump canal water into the Shangtang River and continuing to release water from West Lake, the water plant has also been ordered to pump water for four hours for agricultural use. At the same time, Director Sun of the Executive Yuan Zhejiang Office and Director Pi of the Construction Office have jointly gone to Shanghai to urge the delivery of water pumps for emergency relief.

Editorial

### The Re-Emergence of the Gold Nationalization Issue

On the 15th of this month, the State Council passed revisions to the foreign exchange regulations, which still stipulate the crackdown on gold speculation and the prohibition of foreign currency circulation. However, many people have speculated that these two speculative items will soon appear on the market in new forms. Because the US dollar and foreign exchange are essentially the same thing, and although gold and foreign exchange are not absolutely linked, their relationship is extremely close, so there is no reason to maintain the status quo for long. Now that the exchange of US dollars has been determined in principle through twelve plenary sessions and implementation is being planned, the gold issue will naturally be resolved again.

Recently, there have been rumors in the market that gold will be nationalized, or that the government will purchase gold. Upon closer examination, the first statement may not be very reliable. The reasons are as follows:

Why would the government want to nationalize gold? To sum up, there are three possible reasons: (1) to prepare reserves after currency reform; (2) to replenish foreign exchange funds; (3) to prevent it from flowing into the private sector, which may have adverse economic and financial consequences. These are all valid reasons. But the question is: does the government currently have the huge sum of money needed for the purchase? Will it deepen the degree of currency inflation and worsen the financial and economic situation? If gold bonds are issued to finance the purchase, will it be possible to promote them successfully under the current circumstances? If confiscation is enforced without compensation, it would infringe on the legitimate rights of private individuals, which is absolutely impossible and has already been stated by the authorities. Since this path is blocked, then there is only one way to buy at the official price. However, if the official price is set too low, such as at the current 4.8 million, it is essentially the same as a dummy setting; and if it is set too high, it can make the general holders willing to sell, but it will inevitably cause the problem of purchasing funds. Therefore, the gold nationalization matter, in the current reality, seems to have very little possibility.

Secondly, there is the issue of purchase. If enforced purchase is carried out, with a deadline for completion, the situation will be no different from what was described above. Therefore, what is actually feasible seems to be only to appropriately revise the official price, raise it to a reasonably reasonable level, so that the exchange by the public and the purchase by the government are carried out in a free and indefinite manner, which may be less difficult.

Some people believe that since foreign exchange can be bought and sold at market prices, gold should be allowed to circulate freely without further control. This is naturally the simplest and easiest method. Moreover, the difficulties of the silver industry and the large amount of deadlocked gold can be found a way out, and a way to save money can be found when there is surplus funds and no other way to use them. The question is still whether gold speculation will stimulate prices. According to the past situation of mutual stimulation between gold prices and commodity prices, the drawbacks are indeed terrible. Now the public is demanding a stable life, and the government is also striving to stabilize people's livelihoods. Whether the so-called gold market should be fully opened is indeed worthy of consideration. Weighing the pros and cons, considering the severity, the timing seems to be too early!

### Aspiring Young People Aspire to Join the Army

Shanghai will start enlisting volunteers for the army on the 25th of this month. According to the Ministry of National Defense's troop quota, Shanghai should enlist 3,000 active-duty soldiers and complete the enlistment and training by September 15. This is the first time that Shanghai has promoted military service, and most people are not very clear about the enlistment methods and procedures. However, the success or failure of the first military service will have a great impact on the atmosphere of military administration. Therefore, we must pay close attention to this volunteer enlistment.

According to the spirit of the Military Service Law, the conscription system should be implemented nationwide to establish a national emphasis on military affairs and lay the foundation for national defense. For expedient measures, the military service organs and local governments may implement a volunteer system in accordance with the supplementary provisions of the Military Service Law to achieve the purpose of troop recruitment with simplified procedures. Shanghai has a population of more than 4 million, with a total of 23,537 men of active duty age. If 3,000 people are conscripted according to law, it will not be a problem. Now, changing conscription to recruitment (volunteers should be called recruits in the military system) does not tarnish the dignity of the Military Service Law in theory. However, if the promotion of volunteer enlistment fails, it will affect the subsequent normal conscription and the atmosphere of military administration throughout the country. Recently, looking at the efforts of the Shanghai military service organs, the development of the military service association, and the supervision of the public opinion organs, its work and its deployment are practical and orderly, and the future seems quite optimistic. As long as aspiring men strive to be the first, everyone moves forward, and eagerly join the army, I believe that Shanghai's first implementation of military service will achieve amazing results and become a model for the country.

Serving in the military is a national duty that every citizen should fulfill. Everyone has this duty, which cannot be evaded; and everyone has this right, which cannot be taken away. Military service is divided into two systems, conscription and recruitment. Although the methods are different, the goals are the same. Conscription is based on compulsion, while recruitment is based on volunteering. Conscription involves designating active-duty men of age among the population to enlist and serve in the military according to law. Violators will obstruct military service and violate criminal law. Volunteers, on the other hand, use a call-up method to encourage aspiring young people to join the army and do not use coercive measures, allowing aspiring men to consciously strive for a good opportunity to serve the country. This year, Shanghai will promote military service, focusing on volunteers and supplementing with conscription, and recently announced the "Shanghai Measures for Enlisting Volunteers," with a total of eleven articles, which were published in newspapers. Analyzing the content of the measures, it is very much in line with the principle of fairness. The thoughtfulness and the preferential treatment for volunteer enlistment are all very beneficial to the promotion of military service.

Now, I will briefly describe the content of the conscription and volunteer measures. According to the regulations, any man between the ages of 20 and 30 who is physically healthy, has a clean background, and has never participated in a communist organization can enlist. Qualified volunteers will be given a settlement fee of 50,000 yuan at one time, and a settlement subsidy fee of 4 million yuan will be given, which will be distributed in two installments before entering the camp. In order to avoid desertion and fraudulent acquisition of settlement fees, it is stipulated that volunteers should obtain a reliable guarantee when enlisting. If there is desertion, the guarantor is responsible for compensating for the loss, so volunteers and guarantors have joint and several military service responsibilities. For the sake of the safety of military administration, joint and several guarantees can also prevent crimes that obstruct military service and have considerable social legislative significance. The spirit of these measures has considerable legitimacy. As for whether volunteers should enjoy the preferential rights listed in the Military Service Law after entering the service, the measures do not specify. According to law, volunteers who serve in the active service should enjoy the various preferential rights listed in the Military Service Law. Therefore, we believe that this volunteer enlistment in Shanghai has the advantages of both conscription and recruitment, and should have an effective harvest for the inspiration of aspiring young people.

September 15th is approaching soon.

### Jiang Jiadong Will Fly to Yogyakarta on a Special Plane to Investigate the Situation of Overseas Chinese on the Ground. Indonesia Expresses Its Determination Not to Surrender to the Netherlands

[Our Newspaper News] London, 22nd Broadcast: The Indonesian Republic News Agency said: The Chinese government has dispatched a special plane to Batavia to transport Chinese Consul General Jiang Jiadong to Yogyakarta to investigate the situation of overseas Chinese in the occupied areas of Indonesia. It is reported that the Indonesian Republic government, in view of the fact that most of the information obtained by Jiang is distorted, has made this suggestion.

[United Press Batavia, 22nd] The Indonesian Republic has today sent a formal memorandum to the Chinese government. It stated that the Indonesian government cannot be responsible for the damage and terror suffered by the Chinese people in the area after the withdrawal of Indonesian administrative and military authorities from a certain area, especially when the area is controlled by the enemy. The memorandum stated that the most appropriate way to protect overseas Chinese is for the Chinese government to send official representatives to Indonesia. Previously, Chinese Consul General Jiang Jiadong in Batavia had suggested to the Republic government that a Chinese self-defense force be organized in the Republic's territory to protect the Chinese people, but this suggestion has been rejected.

[Reuters Batavia, 21st] Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir broadcast to the Indonesian people tonight, urging them to continue to fight the Dutch and resolutely not succumb to coercion. Sjahrir also estimated that since the ceasefire order came into effect on August 4, the Dutch army has advanced 88 miles in western Java, 54 miles in central Java, about 94 miles in eastern Java, and about 30 miles in Sumatra. He also refuted Governor-General Van Mook's claim in his broadcast last night that the Indonesian Republic was controlled by Japanese forces, pointing out that the Dutch did not give the Indonesians an appropriate method of resistance and surrendered to the Japanese immediately. He also said that the Dutch's failure to educate the Indonesians allowed Japanese forces to infiltrate Indonesian society.

[Reuters Batavia, 21st] Yogyakarta Radio said: Governor-General Van Mook had made four demands to the Indonesian Republic, and these four demands were not included in Van's English speech distributed to reporters. These requirements are: (1) Indonesia must stop violent actions; (2) Indonesia must stop conflicts; (3) The order to destroy and terrorize must be withdrawn; (4) The intimidation and threatening orders issued to those who recognize their own responsibilities and are therefore regarded as enemies of the Republic must be withdrawn.

### Stalemate in US-Soviet Joint Commission; US Decides to Aid South Korean Reconstruction; Marshall's Letter Still Awaits Soviet Reply

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] It is reported that the United States has virtually abandoned hope of resolving the Korean issue with the Soviet Union. It is now intensifying preparations to support the economy of the US-occupied zone of South Korea as the only means of countering Soviet obstruction of Korean unification.

US officials stated that the economic austerity mentality of the 18th US Congress, coupled with the hopelessness of reaching a common US-Soviet agreement on Korea, has delayed the multi-million dollar reconstruction plan for Korea. However, the fact that the Soviet side did not respond to Marshall's request for a report when US-Soviet talks on Korea reached a stalemate has made this issue even clearer. They stated that the US administration will expedite the submission of a Korean plan early next year, which may cost up to $100 million. The report also indicated that if Congress takes further aid action for Korea, this amount may increase beyond the current $137 million military occupation budget for this fiscal year. It is also learned that the US government is currently seeking a high-ranking, capable civilian official to take charge of the administration of the US-occupied zone of Korea.

[United Press International, Seoul, 22nd] The representative of the Soviet side, Shtikov, today accused the US military authorities of oppressing Korean democratic parties and left-wing social organizations, stating that the Soviet delegation insists on immediately taking measures to restore normal Joint Commission negotiations. Many democratic leaders have been arrested by the US military authorities, and democratic parties and South Korean people who actually support the Moscow Resolution and the work of the Joint Commission have been oppressed. However, Lieutenant General Hodge expressed surprise at the Soviet accusations, stating that those arrested by the US side were of no political significance.

### Soviet Rule; Asian Plan; Report by US Journalist

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] Chicago Daily News correspondent Hulse, in a report on Korean news, stated that the US-Soviet stalemate may force the United States to continue occupying South Korea even after withdrawing from Japan. It is generally believed that the Wedemeyer Mission's task is to change US policy on Far Eastern issues and adopt a tougher approach to Soviet control. If the United States withdraws from Korea, Korea will be controlled by the Communists. Even if the United States and the Soviet Union withdraw from Korea simultaneously, the 150,000 Korean troops trained by the Communists in North Korea will eventually take over the entire Korean peninsula. At the same time, Chicago Tribune reporter Simms, in a report, discussed the Asian plan under Soviet rule. He said that the plan includes: (1) North Korea has been thoroughly communized and will be permanently occupied; (2) North Korea will be merged into a large group comprising Northeast China, Eastern Siberia, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, and Outer Mongolia. If conditions are favorable and Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang are allowed to secede from China, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia will also be added; (3) South Korea will be seized as soon as the United States is unwilling to support it; (4) Japan will be incorporated into the Soviet bloc to encircle China. Regarding the close ties between North Korea under Soviet occupation and the Chinese Communists in Northeast China, Simms said that grain from Northeast China has been transported to North Korea, and tens of thousands of Korean soldiers have joined the Chinese Communists in combat. When the Chinese Communists in Northeast China are oppressed by the National Army, they flee to North Korea.

### Three US Soldiers Arrested in North Korea; Soviets Agree to Release

### Striving to Overcome Severe Economic Crisis; Britain Launches Agricultural Production Increase; Special Appropriation of 400 Million Yuan to Assist Farmers

[Reuters, London, 21st] Minister of Agriculture Williams today launched a large-scale four-year agricultural plan, expecting to increase production by more than 100 million pounds within four years to reduce the burden of purchasing grain from abroad. Williams emphasized that this plan requires unprecedented effort in the history of agriculture. If this goal is unfortunately not achieved, the British people will face widespread malnutrition and widespread unemployment.

The new production volume in the plan will exceed the highest domestic agricultural record during the war when Britain was blockaded by Hitler's submarines by more than 50%. The increased agricultural products should focus on food that originally had to be paid in US dollars, such as pork, eggs, beef, lamb, grains, and flaxseed. The government plans to expand the wheat and barley planting areas, and open another 400,000 acres of flaxseed planting area. The wheat planting area is expected to increase by 50 acres next year, and the number of pigs is expected to triple by 1951-52.

[United Press International, London, 21st] The British government has just announced an appropriation of $400 million for food production increase plans.

### Argentina and Sweden React to New British Economic Measures

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Argentina's decision to stop issuing all import foreign exchange permits and Sweden's decision to stop buying goods from the sterling area are the fastest and most important reactions to the British government's decision to stop redeeming pound sterling. The measures announced by Argentina are even more important than those announced by Sweden, as the suspension of imports includes imports from any part of the world. What impact this will have on Argentina's international finances, or whether Britain is about to negotiate a new trade and financial system with Argentina, is still unclear.

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] President Truman stated at a press conference on the 21st that he may again request Congress to legislate to allow more immigrants to enter the United States.

### Britain Continues to Draw on US Loans; $450 Million; Remaining Portion to be Frozen Indefinitely

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] US Treasury officials announced today that Britain has drawn another $150 million from its loan from the US today.

According to the US-UK financial negotiations that began in Washington on Monday, the loan had a remaining balance of $850 million. The US has approved the continued withdrawal of $450 million, which is to be used to pay for goods already ordered from the US. Three senior US officials were unable to provide any definite date as to when Britain can resume accepting pound sterling and when the frozen loan can be unfrozen.

However, they pointed out that the Bank of England still needs considerable time to establish the necessary institutions to investigate currency exchange conditions. The two technical committees of the US-UK economic talks continued their work today. The trade committee is studying the clause in the US-UK loan agreement that prohibits discrimination against imports from the dollar area, while the financial committee is continuing to review Britain's dollar situation.

### Laborers Believe in Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shanghai Gas Company Employees Once Went on Strike to Fight for Consultant

[Our Reporter] More than 200 employees of the British Shanghai Gas Company had previously demanded that the company hire additional Chinese medicine consultants, but the company refused.

At 8 am yesterday, the union convened a New Chang meeting, and misunderstandings occurred between the two parties. The employees stopped working at 9 am.

The case was dismissed in court, and Liu was released on bail of 10 million yuan.

### Profiting from Selling Conscripts, Two Cases Cracked, Multiple Arrests

[Report from our Newspaper] Yu Peiyuan, through his friend Zhang Rengen, sold a watch to Yang Meifang. Because the mechanism was not good, Yang wanted to return the watch. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, a fight broke out on Nanjing Road. As a result, they were brought to the police station to argue. After investigation by Chief Jiang of the Criminal Division, it was revealed that Shi and Zhang claimed to have met Yang Meifang at the Great World Amusement Park and that Yang was suspected of selling conscripts. For each conscript sold to Ningbo, he could earn 3 million yuan, the introducer would receive a commission of 300,000 yuan, and the conscript would actually receive 1.5 million yuan. The remaining 1.2 million yuan would be used by the transporters to cover travel and food expenses. The brokers Gong Bingsheng and a man surnamed Wu acted as intermediaries, profiting from this. Several batches had already been transported to Ningbo.

Chief Jiang immediately ordered officers to rush to the scene, where they arrested brokers Wang Bingsheng and conscripts Gong Xiaoyou and Xu Xigen. They also went to a secret location and arrested Zhu Zhongliang, a clerk, his wife Wang Suling, and brokers Xie Akun, Wu Afa, Wang Jinshan, Wu Tianxi, Zhou Ade, and eight others. They continued to search and found conscripts Du Zhifang, Li Chungen, and Zhang Erlang. In another hotel, they found a fourteen-year-old boy named Xu Jidong. According to Xu, he was tricked into coming to Shanghai from Jinan, Shandong. He was originally scheduled to be transported in the previous batch, but because he was deemed too short, he was waiting for the next batch. The police substation, because the case involved selling conscripts, plans to hand it over to the garrison headquarters for investigation.

[Another Report] Shi Baogen from Nanyan, under the order of Wang Shengfu, the chief of the tenth bao in his hometown, came to Shanghai to buy conscripts. After arriving in Shanghai, Shi contacted a beggar leader surnamed Chen on Sichuan Road the day before yesterday. For 4 million yuan per person, Chen recruited Lu Demin, Ke Zuoqing, Xu Mingxi, and Fang Genfa. Yesterday morning, when paying, they only gave each person 1.3 million yuan. While waiting for the ship at the Bund, all four were unwilling to go, leading to a conflict. The street police arrived, inquired about the situation, and took everyone to the Huangpu Police Station, accusing them of obstructing military service. It is planned to report the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for punishment.

As a result, he obtained nothing and took her to the team headquarters for torture. Before long, the woman died. Seeing that he had caused trouble, the vigilante buried the body in a deserted field near the northern end of the Shangnan Railway, attempting to destroy the body and reduce the evidence. However, someone discovered it and reported it to the Yangsi Police Substation. After sending personnel to investigate and confirm the facts, in addition to detaining the vigilante who caused the incident, they also requested instructions from the headquarters yesterday for handling the matter.

### Securities Firm Privately Trading Gold and Foreign Currency: More Than Twenty People Summoned for Questioning on a Specific Date

### Shutting Down Illegal Jewish Organization: Unauthorized Establishment of Court Undermines Our Sovereignty

[Report from our Newspaper] The "Arbitration Court" of the illegal organization of Jewish expatriates in Shanghai has been sealed off by the Social Affairs Bureau together with the Police Department on the 16th of this month. The German and Austrian Jewish refugees in Shanghai, numbering about 15,000 to 16,000 people, live in the Hongkou area and have formed the "Jewish People's Protection Association," located at No. 22, Lane 412, Tangshan Road. On February 18, 1940, the association established an arbitration court to mediate civil disputes between Jews. The organization procedure of the "Arbitration Court" is divided into a "four-level, four-trial" system, with a total of six people, including judges, assessors, lawyers, and assistant lawyers. Any civil dispute between Jews that has been mediated by the first, second, and third trials of the court and one of the parties is still not satisfied may request a retrial from the fourth trial (supreme court). The person in charge of the Supreme Court is Laskost, the chairman of the Jewish Expatriate Association. After his ruling, both parties must comply and may not have any further objections.

The discovery of this "Arbitration Court" was in May of this year. When Cheng Rui, a judge of the Shanghai High Court, was handling the divorce appeal case between Jewish people Badi Baitlet and Yixue Daobate, he learned from the evidence presented by the appellant Badi Baitlet that the "Jewish Expatriate Association" had set up an "Arbitration Court" on Tangshan Road and was openly accepting cases. The public judgment book contained the main text and reasons for the parties, just like a court judgment. The High Court sent a letter to the Municipal Government, requesting the National Government to review and instruct. Soon, Chairman Chiang telegraphed an order stating that "the arbitration court undermines sovereignty and ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work with the Municipal Government to ban it." After receiving the order, the Municipal Government secretly ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to thoroughly investigate. Yang Zhifang, a specialist from the Second Division of the bureau, confirmed the facts and also found that the "Jewish Expatriate Association" had not registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. Therefore, on the 16th, he went to the association's office to seal it off. He posted a joint announcement by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department at the site and translated the contents of the announcement into English and informed the vice-chairman of the association. However, the association stated that the "court" had already ceased operations.

### Yang Xiaoquan Surrenders and is Put on Trial: Claims Friction Within the Party

[Report from our Newspaper] Yang Xiaoquan, the special commissioner of the Zhonghe Party stationed in Shanghai, was previously accused of fraud for issuing bad checks at Jinghua, Kang Le, and Dulu restaurants and posing as a friend of Zhuo Qingbao, the director of the New City Police Substation.

### Striving Hard Against Foreign Goods: Zhengtai Rubber Factory Actively Produces, Expanding from Small Scale to Three Factories

[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] While most people are immersed in air conditioning and poolside relaxation, escaping the annoying heat, how many people are toiling in temperatures often exceeding 150 degrees, constantly sweating for China's industrial construction?

As we stepped into the engine room of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, a moving scene unfolded before our eyes: Thirty-one large mixing machines exuded a palpable heat, and more than a thousand workers were diligently operating in a soaking wet environment. Every day, they supply 30,000 pairs of rubber shoes and more than 1,000 tires to the market, enabling domestically produced rubber products to begin to engage in a close-quarters battle with foreign-made products on roads, sports fields, and rainy days!

Planning to Build New-Type Factory Buildings

China's rubber industry has always struggled under the suppression of foreign goods. Zhengtai Rubber Factory's twenty years of research and operation truly reveals a long and heroic process of China's industry seeking a new life. It started from a small-scale establishment in the 16th year of the Republic of China and has now progressed to three factories operating on a large scale at the same time; starting with the trial production of simple rubber shoes, it is now able to manufacture car tires and V-belts. In the process, they purchased 60 mu of open space on Jungong Road, preparing to build new-type factory buildings; established a physical and chemical laboratory, designed and created automobile tires with the highest physical properties; and effectively prevented cracking by replacing the old-fashioned baking method with "vulcanization" drying and using fillers, accelerators, and the latest coatings. As a result, the reputation of "Warrior Brand" was finally established. This reputation was exchanged for the perseverance and devotion of so many people to domestic industry!

Its Internal Frustration

After we visited the factory's staff and workers' children's school, factory director Yuan Shusen began to talk about the difficulties. He said that the factory's medical expenses for workers and all the expenses of this school alone put a burden on the factory, not to mention the workers' food expenses. Therefore, at least half of the manager's energy is spent on stabilizing the economy. The severity of labor-management problems has now caused general industry to suffer the same pain and depression, and the rubber industry has its own internal frustration in this regard: there are four days of power outages in a month, rubber raw material imports are listed under quotas, sales fields are limited to domestic, and Sino-Japanese trade has been opened up again. Thinking that this industry, which has already reached a considerable scale, will once again encounter a decisive blow in the future, we all let out a disappointed sigh.

More Than Two Thousand Strong Arms

It is said that the work efficiency of general workers is also lower than before the war, because the turbulent economic environment motivates them to want to maintain their pre-war living standards at all times. However, as we walked past the tire making machine, we saw sections of red like the setting sun, passing through the hands full of sweat, being pulled out from the machine, the scorching heat making the workers almost suffocate, they were still patiently and calmly looking for broken layers on the tire skin, for work, for the industry, this loyalty is enough to move us, what reason is there to harshly blame them?

The final finishing and boxing of rubber shoes and military tires are all handled by female workers. From female workers in their forties to teenagers, they silently perform their respective tasks under different ages. These more than two thousand strong arms are filling the past emptiness of China's rubber industry!

When you are turning the wheels of your car, speeding towards the breezy poolside, have you ever thought that someone is wiping sweat and fighting hard against those foreign rubber products?

### Head of UNRRA Denies Early Closure: Director Huo States It Is Not True, Supervisory Office Sends Personnel to Question Accused Staff

[Report from our Newspaper] Huo Baoshu, head of UNRRA, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last and went to the office yesterday morning to meet with Li Zhuomin, the deputy director of the agency, and other senior staff. Xu Shichang, the recently dismissed director of the General Affairs Office, was also summoned and questioned for a long time. Regarding the rumor that UNRRA will close early at the end of September, Huo firmly stated that it was not true. UNRRA was originally scheduled to close at the end of this year. After the closure, relief affairs will be handled by the Post-War Relief Committee. The committee is still in the preparation stage. It is generally speculated that the affairs of UNRRA are complicated and that the committee is likely to still be presided over by Huo. It is rumored that Jiang Tingfu, the former head of UNRRA, will make a comeback and be responsible for UNRRA and the Post-War Relief Committee again. People close to Jiang have said that this is definitely impossible.

Chen Jianye, a section chief from the Supervisory Office, went to UNRRA yesterday to investigate and questioned the accused senior staff in detail.

### Continuing to Investigate UNRRA's Account Books: Court Receives Another Secret Report

[Report from our Newspaper] He Huimin, a prosecutor from the District Prosecutor's Office, reviewed UNRRA's relevant account books yesterday. It is rumored that the investigation of the case has come to an end. Prosecutor He said that the investigation of the case has just begun, and it is too early to say that it has come to an end. When reporters asked whether the suspected persons would be summoned for questioning, Prosecutor He said that after reviewing the accounts, if any suspicious points are found, those with serious suspicion will be summoned, but it cannot be decided at this time. Prosecutor He also said that he received a new secret report yesterday with the name "UNRRA Purge Corruption Committee," providing some new clues to the various charges against Li Zhuomin and other six people that have been disclosed in the newspapers. The letter may be the same as the original secret report and was written by people inside UNRRA. Although the letter does not have a responsible person's name, making it impossible to summon them for questioning, the new clues are quite valuable and will be used as a reference to speed up the "investigation."

### Yue Opera School Fundraising, Social Affairs Bureau Urges Completion of Project Plan

[Report from our Newspaper] Yue opera actresses Yuan Xuefen and others have raised 5 billion yuan to establish a Yue opera school and build an experimental theater, and are specially performing "Shan He Lian" at the Golden Grand Theater. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau stated that before the performance, the Social Affairs Bureau instructed them to prepare a project plan for establishing a drama school and building a theater, determine the fund management methods, and fill out a fundraising application form for approval before proceeding. Now that the project plan and other documents have not yet been submitted, the performance has started on the 19th, and the use of the ticket sales proceeds is very questionable. If the procedures are delayed again, the Police Department will be consulted to ban it.

### Workers at Pier No. 1 in Nanshi Scramble for Work: Police Suppress, Fortunately No Trouble Caused

[Report from our Newspaper] Pier No. 1 in Nanshi and Warehouse No. 1 on the shore were previously the property of Ningshao Shipping Company. After Piers No. 1 to No. 9 in Nanshi were taken over by the Public Works Bureau, Warehouse No. 1 was still managed by Ningshao Company. After the victory, Ningshao Company had no ships to operate, so it leased it to Sanbei Company this year. However, after Sanbei leased it, the warehouse was stationed by military police, making it impossible to take over. It was not until the end of last month that the military police were transferred, and Sanbei took over at the beginning of this month. The workers at Pier No. 1 and the warehouse were employed by Da Ji workers when the military police were stationed. Da Ji was originally approved by the Social Affairs Bureau to work at Pier No. 2, while Piers No. 1 and No. 3 were assigned to Sheng Ji workers. Sheng Ji was originally an old worker of Sanbei, and in the past, he rarely worked at Pier No. 1, so he did not care. After Warehouse No. 1 was taken over by Sanbei Company, Sheng Ji workers went to work at Pier No. 1, but were rejected by Da Ji workers. Although Yu Shunhuai of Sanbei Company acted as a mediator, it was still ineffective. The number of Da Ji workers working at Pier No. 2 was originally limited to 40. If there were more, Sheng Ji would send additional workers. Now, in order to resolve the dispute over Pier No. 1, Sheng Ji expressed its willingness to give up Pier No. 2 and allow Da Ji to work there completely. Hua Daxiu, the foreman of Da Ji, also persuaded the workers not to fight any more, but the workers still refused to listen. At around 9:00 AM yesterday, the two sides gathered a crowd at Pier No. 1 and were about to fight. After the Yimiao Police Substation and the Water Police Team learned about it, they sent police officers to the scene to suppress it, and the situation was finally resolved. The Yimiao Police Substation and the Water Police Team are currently inviting the responsible workers from both sides to mediate. As of yesterday evening, there was still no result.

### Pre-Made Uniforms: Prisoner Plans to Escape, Liu Ziyuan is Recognized, Detention Center Staff Suspected

[Report from our Newspaper] Liu Ziyuan, the former judicial section chief of the Yulin Road Police Substation, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was detained at the Masinan Road District Court Detention Center. On July 8, Liu, together with Zhang Hansheng, the mail clerk and guard of the detention center, put on a pre-made guard uniform and strode out of the prison door. When passing through the third iron gate, he was recognized and captured. After questioning, it was determined that he had attempted to escape and was sent to the District Court for handling. The case was heard in court yesterday. According to Liu's statement, he knew from a family letter that his mother was seriously ill and that there were many people in his family, so he thought of escaping home. The guard's hat and badge were stolen, and the Zhongshan suit material was sent by his family and entrusted to Zhang Hansheng to be made in the sewing factory in the detention center, but he did not tell Zhang about the attempted escape. He asked the court to be lenient. Zhang Hansheng stated that Liu's family situation was indeed pitiful, and the Zhongshan suit made from the cloth sent by his family was approved by the operations section of the detention center in advance. He denied any collusion with Liu's escape. The court ordered the sentence to be announced on the 29th of this month.

### 鎭安大血案　孫濬伯餘熖未減　重上法堂

[Our Newspaper's Xi'an dispatch on the 18th] The large-scale bloodbath in Zhen'an County, Southern Shaanxi, which shocked the entire country, involved the former county magistrate of the county, Sun Junbo. This spring, he first seduced the female teacher Wang Min into cohabitation. Afterwards, Ms. Wang, filled with resentment, died of poisoning. This was exposed by Wang's father and the county council, and the latter also revealed other corrupt and illegal acts. Sun then personally led the county government's armed forces on May 2nd, shooting and killing four people, including the Speaker of the Council, Li Weihan, inside and outside Li's residence. Afterwards, he was escorted to the province. In mid-July, the Chang'an District Court sentenced Sun and his two guards to death. Sun and others refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. The first investigation court session was held this morning, with Yuan Binghui, the head of the criminal court, serving as the presiding judge. More than 700 people attended the hearing, creating an unprecedented crowd.

The criminal Sun wore a yellow khaki uniform, had his hair freshly cut, and looked radiant. He entered the court with his head held high and a steady pace, carrying a briefcase. His imposing manner had not diminished at all. Sun claimed that his discord with Speaker Li was due to Li's default on military grain delivery, and Li's collusion with the provincial councilor of the county, Liu Nanhui, in the smuggling of opium, which was discovered by Sun. He claimed that he and Ms. Wang were old acquaintances of ten years, and Ms. Wang voluntarily married him, with a wedding officiant present. Their relationship after marriage was also happy. Ms. Wang died due to a miscarriage, not from poisoning. He also accused Speaker Li of plotting a riot, evidenced by a large number of military firearms and ammunition found in Li's residence after the incident.

Sun then loudly declared: "I am a revolutionary soldier, a hero, and I am not afraid of death. Speaking of death, I can die here in court. I am appealing only to fulfill my duty." It is said that Sun had previously declared, "If I am found guilty, I will not appeal, I will definitely commit suicide in court." Therefore, he made this statement to "dissipate embarrassment." Sun even said, "Li's death eliminates a scourge for Zhen'an!"

Sun's defense lawyer stated that the first instance of the district court did not pay attention to collecting evidence favorable to the defendant, and only made a judgment based on one-sided testimonies unfavorable to the defendant, which was unfair. He expressed "regret" towards the Xi'an news media's unanimous criticism of Sun Junbo after the incident was exposed, which led to the court being subjected to pressure from public opinion and unable to deliver a fair verdict. This naive inference by the lawyer has aroused widespread resentment in the journalistic circles.

When the two guards who assisted Sun in committing the crime were brought to court, they also denied the murderous acts at the time, attempting to evade the death sentence handed down in the first instance.

One thing that was not understood by the people inside and outside the courtroom was that the two guards had shackles on their feet, while the "County Magistrate" Sun did not have any restraints. He rode in a carriage between the court and the prison.

Whether the second instance will uphold the original judgment is worth watching. (Reporter Mai Ye)

### Qing-Hu Highway Bandits Open Fire: One American Injured, Escapees Flee, One Truck Looted

[Our Newspaper's Qingpu dispatch on the 21st] A hijacking incident occurred on the Qing-Hu Highway this morning, involving the shooting and wounding of an American. Around six o'clock in the morning, more than 20 bandits, hiding on the side of the 14th bridge on the highway (30 miles from the city), were planning their attack when a Jeep driven from Shanghai to Qing arrived. Two American men and two women were inside, on an outing. As the Jeep drove by the side of the bridge, three bandits in grass-green uniforms with fast-firing machine guns rushed out from the roadside, shouting for the car to stop. More than 20 other bandits, fully armed, each with a handgun, swarmed up. The Americans in the car, seeing the unfavorable situation, attempted to draw their guns for self-defense, but the bandits preemptively opened fire. One American was shot and injured on the spot. Another American quickly turned the car around and sped away. The car was slightly damaged by stray bullets, but ultimately escaped and was not intercepted. At the same time, a truck also traveling from Shanghai to Qing, carrying more than 60 fishmongers including Song Liangsheng, intending to transport fish at Fangyao Town on the 11th bridge, arrived behind the Jeep and was unable to escape. It was immediately intercepted by the bandits and looted completely, with no one spared. The losses amounted to around 100 million yuan. The bandits then fled from Liuxia Township towards Songjiang County. The three nearby townships of Fangyao, Hemu, and Xujing, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched self-defense forces to track and encircle the bandits. According to residents of Laozhai Township, the American Jeep that was attacked by the bandits fled in panic, overturning into a field near Laozhai Town (5 miles from the scene). Fortunately, it was rescued by the villagers and driven back to Shanghai. One severely injured American had a bullet enter from the back and exit from the front of his groin. The injury was quite serious, and his life may be in danger. His name is unknown.

### Abusing Daughter-in-Law Provokes Public Outrage: Taiyuan Shrew Paraded Through the Streets

[Our Newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch on the 18th] A case of a mother-in-law abusing her daughter-in-law occurred in Taiyuan City, arousing public outrage, resulting in the unusual event of parading her through the streets as a public display. Hao Chu, the 39-year-old wife of Hao Guangming, who lives at No. 14 Haibian Street, is naturally shrewish. Her eldest son, Fulu, 18, had been engaged by a matchmaker to Tao'er, the daughter of Zhao Yu of No. 14 Luoguo Lane. Zhao is a civil servant, and because his income was not enough to support his family, he sent his beloved daughter to the Hao family as a child bride. After entering the Hao family, Hao Chu treated this child bride with all kinds of abuse. In the 34th year of the Republic (1945), Zhao Yu discussed with his father and received his consent to welcome Tao'er back to her parents' home to complete the wedding according to local customs. The young couple got along extraordinarily well after they got married. Unexpectedly, this greatly increased the resentment of her shrewish mother-in-law, Hao Chu, who abused her daughter-in-law even more. Severe beatings and scolding became commonplace. A few days ago, Fulu received 50,000 yuan in relief funds from the school. Thinking that his wife was often abused and that his wife's family was also poor, he secretly gave all the money to his wife to use as pocket money, without holding back a single penny. Unexpectedly, Hao Chu found out about this. Like an angry lioness, she roared and questioned Tao'er about the source of the money. Tao'er preferred to endure the beating herself and hid the truth. Hao Chu became even more angry and beat her severely with a wooden stick, causing injuries all over her body. At this point, Fulu could no longer bear to stand by and watch, so he resolutely admitted that he had given her the money, and knelt down to plead for her. Unexpectedly, Hao Chu thought that it was her own son who was now protecting his wife, which was extremely rebellious and unfilial, adding fuel to the fire and making her even more furious. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable and fearing his mother's fierce power, Fulu got up from the ground and took the opportunity to sneak away. Hao Chu vented her anger on her daughter and ordered her to go out and look for him. However, the sea of people was vast and unattainable. She wandered the streets until late at night, but did not dare to return home. However, due to the severe injuries she had suffered and the fact that she had not eaten all day, she eventually became exhausted and fainted on a pile of ashes in front of the door. The next day, neighbors found her and rescued her. This tragic incident immediately spread to every household on the street, arousing public outrage. More than a thousand residents gathered at the street office at noon on the 11th to discuss how to deal with the situation. With many opinions flying, everyone agreed to parade Hao Chu through the streets as a public display, and ordered the guarantor to no longer abuse her daughter-in-law in the future. Zhao Tao'er will be temporarily taken back to her relatives for recuperation. A storm finally subsided.

Sewing Thread Industry Representatives Survey Southeast Asian Markets

[Report from This City] The main business of China's sewing thread industry is the production of "wood yarn balls." Before the war, it was widely sold in Southeast Asia, earning a large amount of foreign exchange every year.

### Revision of Exchange Settlement Methods Increases Coal Mining Costs by 10%

[Our Dispatch] According to a responsible person from the Management Committee speaking to reporters: Since the government revised the exchange settlement methods, the direct impact on coal mining is mainly in two areas: (1) pit props, and (2) mining materials. This will generally increase production costs by about 10%. Currently, the only foreign coal used in our country is Hongji white coal. The main coal supply still relies on the mines of Kailuan, Huadong, Huainan, and Taiwan. The 30,000 tons of bituminous coal ordered from Canada by the previous government, over 9,000 tons has arrived by the week before. This time, the government has specifically listed coal per catty as one of the five kinds of materials eligible for official exchange rates. However, it is believed that most of this official-price foreign coal will be reserved for safety coal. In this city, it is planned to increase the safety coal reserve to 300,000 tons in case of insufficient coal supply, to be allocated for regulation and so on.

### Japonica Rice Slightly Increases

Yesterday, a total of over 2,600 shih of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. Rumors circulated that Hankou was again under blockade, and inland prices were frequently rising.

White yuan remained stable, and yin yuan also rose by ten thousand yuan. New japonica remained temporarily stable. In the northern market, japonica and indica rice sales were very brisk, and both japonica and indica rice rose by ten thousand yuan.

The oil market is experiencing a sharp rise in prices. Shipments from Qingdao are scarce, and prices are soaring. Raw oil increased sharply by thirty to fifty thousand yuan, rapeseed oil increased sharply by thirty to forty thousand yuan, soybean oil also jumped by twenty to thirty thousand yuan, and refined oil followed suit, rising by twenty to thirty thousand yuan. The supply and demand of sesame oil are both low, and market conditions are firm.

### Sino-Hong Kong Agreement Signed Successfully; Hong Kong Government to Assist Us in Combating Smuggling; Shao Zenghua Completes Mission and Returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong

[Our Dispatch] Deputy Director of the National Bank's Business Bureau, Mr. Shao Zenghua, along with the bank's consultant, Mr. Rogers, flew to Hong Kong earlier last month, representing the National Bank to negotiate financial and economic cooperation issues with the Hong Kong government. They have successfully concluded the negotiations and formally signed the Agreement Memorandum in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. Having completed his mission in Hong Kong, Mr. Shao has returned to Shanghai on the 20th of this month to report on his work.

It is reported that Mr. Shao's discussions with the Hong Kong government during his stay in Hong Kong were quite smooth, and the Hong Kong side expressed great cooperation, which ultimately led to the completion of the agreement signing. Mr. Shao declined to disclose the detailed terms. According to reporters, the scope of the agreement mainly covers the following three points: (1) The Hong Kong side is willing to assist us in combating smuggling of imports and exports. (2) The Hong Kong side is willing to assist us in combating the existence of black market exchange rates for national currency and US dollars in Hong Kong. (3) The Hong Kong government agrees that its US dollar revenue (which mainly comes from remittances from our overseas Chinese and export trade) should, after deducting the amount required by Hong Kong, be used only for Sino-Hong Kong trade and not for trade with third countries. If there is a surplus, the surplus should be resold to the National Bank.

General observers believe that this agreement signed between us and the Hong Kong government will be able to mutually cooperate with the implementation of revised import and export trade and foreign exchange management measures. It is expected that issues such as smuggling in South China and the black market for foreign exchange in Hong Kong can be thoroughly eliminated in the future, thereby removing the threat to our country's financial trade.

### Encouraging Nurse Wang to Work Hard

This column previously received a letter from Nurse Wang, stating that due to her qualifications, she is often looked down upon by her colleagues. Currently employed at a certain organization, she has also had her base salary reduced by the superior authority due to the lack of a diploma. Having suffered repeated blows, she feels deeply distressed. Therefore, she described in detail her experience of missing out on education and her hard work, hoping to be disclosed in the newspaper, expecting the sympathy of the public, and so on. The original text was too long and could not be published, so a brief reply is provided below, Editor's Note.

Dear Ms. Wang, After receiving your letter, we learned that you have devoted yourself to nursing work based on a spirit of universal love, rescuing and protecting soldiers during wartime, and caring for patients groaning in their sickbeds during peacetime. Your work is extremely meaningful, and your spirit is very admirable! We deeply sympathize with your pain of being unable to complete your studies due to your poor family circumstances. The so-called discrimination due to a lack of "qualifications" is, under certain circumstances, inevitable. It is certainly very fulfilling for a person to have both excellent character and genuine knowledge. However, if a young person who has missed out on education and whose circumstances do not allow them to obtain qualifications can aspire to work diligently and persevere in their studies, seeking learning in their work, then, given time, it may well be a path to honing genuine talent and practical skills. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." Although you do not have "qualifications" due to missing out on education, there is really no need to be pessimistic. Let people laugh at you in whispers. We sincerely hope that you will work hard and study hard! Everything is a learning opportunity. We believe that the result of hard work and self-encouragement will "certainly lead to extraordinary achievements." Wishing you progress!

### Explanation of "Tianhu Yuan"

Reply to reader Zhang Weici

Recently, I read a news item in your newspaper on August 13th, titled "Creating and Destroying Tianhu Yuan," and it stated that the central government periodically destroys it, but it is not explained what "Tianhu Yuan" is. I hope you can provide an explanation. Reader Zhang Weici

[Editor's Reply] The so-called "Tianhu Yuan" originated from farmers on the banks of Dongting Lake in northern Hunan, who, when the lake water recedes each year, embank a portion of the lake area (i.e., Tianhu Yuan) to create fields, causing the lake area to shrink. When the water rises, it cannot be contained and overflows into Hubei Province (due to the terrain). Therefore, people in Hubei firmly demand that Tianhu Yuan be created and destroyed, returning the fields to the lake to avoid harm, while people in Hunan oppose the creation and destruction due to their interests. The dispute has been going on for a long time. However, the central government, in order to take into account all considerations, has decided to create and destroy it.

Telecommunications Q&A

### Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Answers

[Question from Xu Ping, Hangzhou] How does a "facsimile machine" transmit true-copy telegrams?

A facsimile machine uses photoelectric phenomena to transmit telegrams. The main transmitting equipment includes a rotating cylinder, guide screw, synchronous motor, light source, lens, plane mirror, and phototube. The receiving side includes a rotating cylinder, guide screw, synchronous motor, and tracing needle. The transmitting function is to divide the original text into lines and dots, convert them into electrical current by the phototube, and then send them to the other party through wireless or wired circuits. The receiving side amplifies the received current and then uses the tracing needle, driven by the synchronous motor, to generate a corona on a specially prepared receiving paper, reproducing text that is exactly the same as the original. This is the general working principle of a facsimile machine for true-copy telegrams.

[Question from Lu Jun, Zhabei Water and Electricity Road] (Omitted)

Our bureau's repair of telephone user faults is based on user reports or daily routine tests. The repair room issues a work order and sends a repairman. The repairman holds a work order when going out for repairs. If the same fault occurs again within a specified period after the repair, our bureau has penalties, and the repairman will be punished. If the user's line experiences a fault in the future and there are suspicions of "artificial damage" as mentioned in the letter, the user can report the fault occurrence and the date of each repair to our bureau, and we will conduct a thorough investigation. Our bureau highly welcomes users' good intentions in assisting in exposing malpractices. Our bureau has always prohibited employees from soliciting bribes. However, it also relies on the cooperation of users. If there are incidents of solicitation, please report them in detail, and we will strictly crack down on them. As for the suggestion to handle the transfer procedures, according to Article 8 of the revised "Measures for Limiting Urban Telephones" promulgated by the Ministry of Communications, "Transfer is only allowed two years after the installation of the machine. If the transfer is done privately within two years, resulting in inconsistency between name and reality, the phone will be suspended and the machine dismantled once discovered by the authorities." Those who meet the above regulations can apply for verification.

Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn, literary section)

### Flowers and Children

— Ren Jun

In the early morning, I just got out of bed and stood on the lawn in front of the door.

Some flowers and trees grow around the lawn. Many flowers are in bloom. White, red, yellow, purple… fully bloomed, half-bloomed, budding… the petals are all covered with overnight dew, shimmering like pearls under the sunlight.

A breeze blew by. The flowers swayed on the branches, as if nodding to me, as if smiling and saying to me: "Good morning"!

——Good morning! May you all be well! I also smiled unconsciously and answered them in my heart.

Not long after a burst of urgent ringing, a group of children, still rubbing their sleepy eyes, ran out of the house to the lawn.

They were jumping and skipping, like calves or lambs that had just been released from the pen.

They were busy playing seesaw, riding wooden horses… They were laughing and making noise, like a large group of sparrows chirping incessantly.

At this moment, I suddenly felt very keenly, realized: Children are also flowers, flowers of humanity!

Isn't that so? ——The relationship between us adults and children is like the relationship between branches and flowers! Flowers decorate the branches, continue the branches, enrich the branches, bring the future and hope to the branches… Similarly, children also decorate our lives, continue our lives, enrich our interests, bring us the future and hope…

Moreover, our little flowers are more beautiful, more lively, and more lovely than all of them.

Isn't that so! ——Ours can jump and make noise, while theirs are always silently and rarely moving; ours can speak, laugh, and sing, while theirs are always silent…

While I was standing and contemplating, the children had already run to my side and discovered my existence; they immediately cheered as usual: "Good morning! Uncle × good morning"!

So, I picked up the smallest one among them, named Zuo Zuo, and held him up as their representative, kissed their apple-like rosy and full cheeks, and then also replied loudly:

"Good morning! Children, no, little flowers, good morning! May you all be well! May you all grow stronger, more beautiful, and more fragrant than those flowers! Our tomorrow, our career, everything of ours, is completely entrusted to you!"

(1947, mid-summer, in Shanghai)

### Knowing the Warmth and Coldness Oneself; One of the Rambling Talks During a Busy Schedule

— Li Baifeng

Li Changji, with his long eyebrows and long fingernails, has a line that says: "I don't believe that year after year on the Liaohai Sea, where does literature cry in the autumn wind?" These short fourteen characters have revealed the loneliness of literati who know their own sweetness and bitterness. Although "Autumn tombs ghost sing the poetry of the Bao family" is eerily scary, Changji's wandering life is actually the same as that which Qu Dafu entrusted to the "Mountain Ghost." Using objects for satire is also an example of knowing the warmth and coldness oneself.

Ancient and modern poets do not seek to follow the fashion when writing, so the situation of knowing the warmth and coldness oneself is deeper and greater. When the literary movement of the Six Dynasties was popular, Chen Ziang began to sigh, "In front, I do not see the ancients, behind, I do not see the successors..." He is not sighing that he cannot see the ancients, but rather sighing that "I regret that I was born too late to love the ancients." The predecessors have passed away, and there is no one to continue. Although I have the will, I am not known to anyone… Is this Chen Ziang's sorrowful and bleak heart that knows the warmth and coldness himself? And Li Qingyun's "The Great Elegant has not been composed for a long time, who will present my decline?" and Du Shiyi said, "Read ten thousand volumes of books, and the pen writes as if divinely guided." "Words that do not startle people will never rest," on the one hand, it is enough to show the deep and great achievements of the predecessors, and on the other hand, it is also enough to show the feeling of knowing the sweetness and bitterness of the warmth and coldness.

Yuan Zheng's inscription on Du Zimei's tombstone said, "Since poets, there has been no one like Zimei." This sentence can be said to be extremely pertinent. If Du Gongbu did not know the warmth and coldness himself, then the six quatrains on poetry could not have been written, with the line "There is no doubt about the former sages." This statement is indeed a humble one, but it is also enough to see the source of Gongbu's great achievements. And "Wang Yang Lu Luo was the style of the time, and frivolous writing was ridiculed without end; your bodies and names will perish together, but the Yangtze River will flow forever." Shouldering great responsibilities, one cannot speak of it unless one is absolutely able to know the warmth and coldness oneself. The source of frivolous contemporary writing still follows the Six Dynasties. If the true stream of poetry does not perish, then Wang Yang Lu Luo will certainly not be recited for thousands of years. Although Wang Yang Lu Luo are praised as the Four Great Talents of the early Tang Dynasty, when comparing their poetry with that of Li Du, it still feels delicate and weak. Du Fu was not a frivolous youth. With his feelings for Li Bai, which have not changed for decades, we can know that his difficulty with Wang Yang and others actually comes from the standpoint of artistic appreciation. His "Literature hates those who are successful" is originally an appeal for Li Bai, and at the same time, it is a resonance of knowing the sweetness and bitterness oneself. Especially when viewed with the two sentences "Do not despise modern people who love ancient people, clear words and beautiful sentences must be neighbors," we can know that what he despised in Wang Yang and others is that their poetry and prose still derived from the Six Dynasties; what he loved in the ancients is that their words and atmosphere were heavy and substantial. And Du Fu's love and hate were not about "people," but determined by "poetry." Therefore, he was particularly fond of Li Bai, because his clear words and beautiful sentences were lovely, and he must seek to be his neighbor with virtue. His self-knowledge and knowledge of others are also unique to poets throughout the ages. It is not like today's poets, who form factions and attack dissidents. It can be deeply felt when speaking of it.

Su Dongpo's poem "Spring River Water Warm, Ducks Know First" is said to be about ducks, but it is actually about people. He identified those who did their best as "disciples who overturned the style of China," not only because of their "thick soil, deep water, and heavy words," and "but opening the style and not being a teacher," but also because their poetic style was high and ancient, clear and strange, and could possess grief, supervision, heroism in one furnace. Ducks know the warmth of the water first, because they have not left the water. Poets must also know the sweetness and bitterness of the good and bad of poetry. If they do not often cherish the heart of "fearing to become the dust of Qi and Liang," and even as Mr. Zhu Xiang said: "Using poetry as a stepping stone to advancement, and waiting until they have officials and money, they will no longer write poetry." (The general meaning is like this, see "Collection of Letters"), like this kind of strange rhyme of "presenting a letter to a certain Ministry of Works," and "being in the mountains and forests, but with the heart in the imperial court," randomly composing in even and uneven tones will eventually lead to the destruction of both body and name. The only treatment for this kind of poet is to read the collection of Zheng Banqiao, so that they can slightly dispel their absurd thoughts.

Meng Haoran was known to the world for his ability to chant, but he did not know the bitterness of the world's warmth and coldness. His response was not with the poem "The lake is level in August," but with "The incapable are abandoned by the enlightened ruler, and the many illnesses cause the old friends to be estranged." No wonder he ended up with the sentence "It is not I who abandoned you, but you who abandoned me," and eventually died in seclusion in the forest springs. The two sentences of "incapable" are a complaint when the bitterness is expressed to others. The matter of complaining cannot be done by the foolish, nor should it be done by the wise. In the past, Su Dongpo was demoted for his washing-baby poem, which is also an example of "I have been misled by cleverness all my life." Birds lose their lives because of their colorful feathers, so one must be careful!

Jia Yi, who said, "An owl gathers in the house, the master will leave," could not know the warmth and coldness himself, and forced himself to be clever. He found it difficult to deal with the affairs of the common people and ghosts and gods, and eventually ended up being transferred to Changsha and dying in depression.

Therefore, "warmth and coldness" contain some "sweetness and bitterness." If you do not see it clearly yourself, you will only damage this path. In this time and in this world, writing three or two articles does nothing to supplement the national economy and the people's livelihood, and it is not urgent for the tears of the common people, it is really better to burn the manuscript and bury the flowers, and listen to the ghosts singing in the autumn tombs at night.

### Memories of Western Hills

— Feng Li

On a hot summer night, there was no breeze, and the leaves were still as if they had fallen asleep. My heart was anxious and I had no sleepiness at all. The thoughts of my mind gradually drifted away, and I thought of the Western Hills of Peiping. It was the first time in my life that I had gone to escape the summer heat, and it was the only time. Ever since I came back from that summer retreat, I began to taste the troubles of life—I began to study, which is a trouble that children cannot escape. After that, the various troubles that my age brought me followed. I, who was stimulated by twenty years of troubles, could no longer bear to look back on the happiness of the past.

Lazily leaning on a rattan chair, silently gazing at the horizon, I hoped to find a shooting star among the stars.

A little phosphorescence flew under the dark shadows of the trees. I suspected it was a fallen shooting star. It seemed to be a little spiritual rhinoceros horn, illuminating my childhood memories.

I remember it was the summer of my fifth year. My maternal grandmother and mother took my cousins and me to the Western Hills to escape the summer heat. We rented two rooms in Biyun Temple. Our neighbors were three university students. Mr. Lin was the most lively of them. He liked to tease me the most. His liveliness and naughtiness stimulated my young mind.

They often took us donkey riding, and it was always Mr. Lin who took me. Stepping on the wildflowers covered with dew, a burst of the donkey's copper bell rang loudly. Our donkey took the lead, and his classmates and my cousins all fell behind. A light breeze blew through my loose hair, brushing against his chest. I couldn't help turning my face and smiling at him.

The spring water in the Western Hills was very sweet. Mr. Lin held the spring water in his hands for me to drink. That sweet spring was a great comfort to travelers, but at that time, I had only traveled such a short journey!

In the evening, the cool breeze was blowing, and in the bushes outside Biyun Temple, there was a sea of phosphorescence, like the stars tonight. I burrowed into the bushes to catch the fireflies, and several times I wanted to put them together in my palm, but before I could get close, they had drifted away gently like ghost fires. At this time, Mr. Lin brought a gauze bag, full of fireflies, and slowly walked to my side. Then my heart blossomed like this group of fireflies.

But happiness is short-lived, like a shooting star sliding across the sky, only a momentary flash of light, shining in my life.

### Juniet's Cart

— Rousseau

Rousseau (Henri Rousseau, 1841-1910) was a man of little education. He served in the military, participated in the Franco-Prussian War, and also worked as a customs officer. He did not learn to paint from a teacher, but simply described himself like a child. Soon, he suddenly jumped to become a painter. However, he never joined the ranks of professional painters, and rarely appeared in public until he participated in the "Independent Art Exhibition" in 1886, when he began to attract attention.

His work is simple and unadorned, innocent and archaic, neither imitating the ancients nor imitating the contemporary, and without any scientific knowledge. He only describes according to the illusions in his eyes, becoming an absolutely subjective expression. He is one of the four great vajras of the Post-Impressionist school.

This work is owned by P. Rosenberg. (Liu Shi)

### Frog Song

— Li Yixun

After a vacant lot outside the wall was just converted into a small garden, I heard frog songs every night. So, in addition to the barking of dogs and the monotonous sound of the night watchman's clapper, summer nights added another kind of music.

On the first night, I didn't know where they were calling from, and I went to look for them in the moonlight, but I only heard the sound coming from a patch of shallow grass, and I still couldn't see their traces. I stood and listened for a long time, and I was really a little surprised that these flat, wide mouths were chattering non-stop. What did it mean: singing? Dialogue? Or cursing? Or, just calling for the sake of calling, nothing at all.

In Lu Xun's "Comedy of Ducks," he mentioned that the Russian blind poet Eroshchenko was concerned about why there were no frog songs in Beijing as soon as he arrived in Beijing, as if he was unbearably lonely. In fact, I think it's not because this blind poet has any special preference for frog songs, but because he is blind and sees nothing; when he first arrived in Beijing, it was during a hot summer night, and in a monotonous circle of life without any sound, even frog songs seemed to be a wonderful kind of music.

But if you get used to this music that never changes except for "ge ge ge", you will also feel monotonous and tasteless, and even think that this sound is simply superfluous, and only destroys the loneliness of summer nights.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 382

— Ye Jingfeng

Speaking of "Dunjia" (遁甲, a metaphysical system), many people with excessive imaginations will again force associations with mystical and incredible magic. In fact, according to the new explanation, it's just a kind of "camouflage" in the deployment of positions. With camouflage, you can deceive the enemy's eyes and ears, and as a result, I can avoid bad luck and seek good fortune.

The old stockade's method of camouflage is extremely simple; it merely sets up several devices to lead people to other small roads, preventing them from reaching the road into the canyon. After the Japanese occupied Shenyang, there were indeed several armed exploration teams that came to the old stockade; however, after exploring twenty or thirty *li* beyond the canyon, they were blocked by a stretch of treacherous forest. At the edge of the treacherous forest, there were only a few dilapidated thatched huts, inhabited by some poor hunters, which they deemed unworthy of deeper investigation. Fortunately, each time Lord Long conducted guerrilla warfare, it was two or three hundred *li* away. After the attacks, the main force had already left; only a few hidden sentry lines remained, leading the enemy search parties into the remote mountains and treacherous forests, letting them see gods and ghosts. They never imagined that these poor hunters surrounding the old stockade had anything to do with it.

The several routes leading in and out of the old stockade all had secret agents dispatched, directly reaching Shenyang. In Shenyang City, there was also a precise network of informants; therefore, the old stockade understood the dynamics of Shenyang like the back of its hand. Since the Republic of China's restoration, only one person knew the situation of the old stockade: the captain of Zhang Zuolin's special detective team, a naturalized Italian. He had good eyesight and learning, and his actions were very much in line with the chivalrous path. Only then did Lord Long come into contact with him. After the September 18th Incident, he resigned from his post. The Japanese side did not allow it but instead placed his wife and daughters under surveillance, wanting to use him to guide routes to "annihilate" the righteous people's corps, volunteer army, Red Spears Society, White Way Society, and various stockade "anti-Japanese" groups, etc. How could they restrain him with this clumsy method?

Tsurumi was a thoughtful person with keen eyes, so he came into contact with this person. It was Tsurumi who introduced him to Lord Long. … However, while there was contact, Lord Long never allowed them to visit the old stockade. This wasn't because Lord Long lacked friendship; it was simply that these two people's actions attracted too much attention. For the sake of the old stockade's safety, only implementing this "isolation" method could be considered appropriate. The two men were quite understanding.

Later, Tsurumi introduced Yaoqun to learn the truth from this detective team leader. After his death, seeing that Yaoqun had no prospects, and wanting her to gain some practical experience, he introduced her to Lord Long to stay as a guest in the old stockade. Before the July 7th Incident, the Japanese aggression against China was increasingly urgent. Yaoqun felt that this kind of passive waiting, occasionally fighting guerrillas, could not compensate for the overall situation, nor could it fully display her talents. Only then did she tell Lord Long that she wanted to enter the pass to seek opportunities and do some work for the country. Lord Long originally had this idea, so he greatly agreed and also expressed that if there was a suitable opportunity in the future, he himself would also be willing to enter the pass and serve the country loyally. Immediately, he personally ran to Shenyang, sent a secret telegram, and informed Zhang Jinlong, the old stockade's business representative stationed in Peiping, to properly receive Yaoqun and suggested that Yaoqun select a few male and female strong people to bring with her to use.

Yaoqun pondered for a while and politely declined Lord Long's suggestion: She thought that her future was still a blur, how could she make such arrangements. She would wait until she had made progress before considering it. Lord Long had no choice but to drop the suggestion. He only instructed Yaoqun that if she encountered any trouble, Zhang Jinlong was quite resourceful and could be asked to help. After discussing and deciding, Yaoqun then prepared her travel arrangements and set off alone.

Who knew that the day Yaoqun entered the station, even though she was so meticulous and clever, she was pushed in the crowd, and somehow, her handbag was opened. When she went to get money to buy a ticket, she realized that the clothes in the bag were still there, but only her purse was missing. Just as she was feeling distressed and amused, she heard a child's voice behind her calling "Aunt Ji..." After spending endless effort and countless words, she had finally gotten rid of the little tiger, but she hadn't expected him to still secretly chase after her.

### Remotely Pointing at the Milky Way to Discuss "Qixi"

— Shilang

"Qixi" (七夕, the Double Seventh Festival) and "Qiqiao" (乞巧, begging for skills) can evoke many beautiful reveries in us: this legendary "festival" gives the ancient, leisurely Chinese sons and daughters a lot of warmth. But today, who has the mood to beg for skills from the Milky Way? Who has the leisure to kneel down to the double stars crossing the river and pray for blessings?

Prices are like thorns, making you restless day and night; after the exchange rate was recognized, the cigarette industry rose by 30%; gasoline doubled; private universities charge 2 million per semester; public utilities are also clamoring to adjust prices. These things, those things, make today's sons and daughters, what mood do they have to peep at the "Cowherd" and "Weaver Girl's" meeting in the Milky Way.

Look, Japanese goods are immediately pouring into Chinese ports; after suffering eight years of hardship, enduring the long-term humiliation of Japanese bandits, those cheap goods from before the war are again displayed before your eyes. According to general purchasing power, everyone should like Japanese goods, because they are cheap and exquisite; but emotionally speaking, this hatred hasn't been eliminated, yet it comes to your door putting on a "flattering smile." Do you buy it or not?

It is said that 15,000 Japanese alarm clocks have arrived in Hong Kong, and their ringing cannot awaken the confusion of Chinese sons and daughters!

To return to the ancient mood of seeking blessings under the Qixi Milky Way, in today's view, it is somewhat ironic, isn't it?

Perhaps tonight, this evening, there will still be the embellishments of congratulating "Qixi", but every parent, they are either calculating the rise in rice and oil, or they are shivering for their children's education expenses. Although the Milky Way is still there, who has the mood to beg for skills from the Milky Way cloud magpies?

### Orders of the Seventh Month

— Xiang Ruo

A few days before the Start of Autumn, a light rain urges coolness, as if it were early autumn. Therefore, there is a saying, "Ten days in advance, it's autumn." Li Fu thus composed a poem: "The green shade of parasol trees fills the courtyard, inviting the new coolness to the pillow's edge. A few gusts of light rain and slanting wind pass by, ten days in advance, it's autumn."

Thunder on the Start of Autumn indicates that the rice ears will not be full. There is a saying, "Autumn grain is stony, harvest empty grain." Also, when the rice ears are in bloom, a thick fog arises, with a white rainbow traversing it, commonly called "Baiqi," it also indicates a harvest of empty grain, called "heaven's harvest." Cai Yun's *Wu Yu* says: "Rain sprinkles and wind blows, the sun is clear again, ten days before autumn, the sounds of autumn begin. Snow melons and fire wine are nearly refreshingly new, afraid to hear the jade tiger鳴 (meaning thunder)鸣鳴鳴 in the sky."

According to local custom, the morning and night of the Start of Autumn are used to predict coolness and heat. There is a saying, "Autumn begins in the morning, *sou sou* (onomatopoeia for cool wind), autumn begins at night, hot *pan pan* (onomatopoeia for hot)." After morning, there may still be times when it is unbearably hot, which is called "autumn tiger."

On the Qixi Festival, the market is already selling clever sweets. Some accompany flowers and fruits, placing incense and candles in the courtyard, or on the terrace, to worship the double stars to beg for skills. Cai Yun's *Wu Yu* says: "How many female companions worship in the front courtyard, joyfully speaking of the magpies building a bridge across the Milky Way. Clever sweets fill the plate, and the young ladies gorge themselves, begging every year from the double stars."

On the evening of the seventh day before, take a cup and fill it with "Mandarin Duck Water", scoop it and mix it with dew in the courtyard. Expose it to the sun the next day, slowly wait for a membrane to form on the surface of the water, then each take a small needle and toss it to make it float. Then look at the shadow of the needle at the bottom of the water to verify intelligence or clumsiness, which is called begging for skills. Wu Manyun's Preface to *Jiang Xiang Festival Items* says that it is right to thread needles to return to custom, and those who rely on it call it "needle shadow." The poem says: "Threading needles every year, we make appointments with neighbors, further using the remaining skills to kill the needle god. Alone at home, I see the shadow of the dragon shuttle, continuing the Mandarin Ducks that do not cross people."

After Qixi, observe the brightness and darkness of the Milky Way to predict the rise and fall of rice prices, saying that darkness indicates expensive rice, brightness indicates cheap rice. Gu Tieqing's poem says: "The color of the waning moon reflects the Former Han, the quiet night Milky Bay looks low in one sweep. Wanting to predict the new rice price in the coming autumn, the Heavenly Granddaughter marries far away in Hexi." At this time, the farmers have just finished plowing, and each collect money to offer sacrifices to the god of fierce generals, carrying the god to the field, slaughtering livestock and setting up offerings, with drums and music to thank him. It is said that if this is done, locusts will not be a disaster, which is called burning green seedlings.

The Hungry Ghost Festival, commonly known as the Seventh Month Half. People, regardless of rich or poor, all worship their ancestors. Wu Zimu's *Meng Liang Lu* says: "On the Hungry Ghost Festival, sacrifices to ancestors use hemp grain nests, implying the intention of reporting the autumn harvest in advance." It also says: "Those who have the means set up ancestral halls in their homes to mourn." On this day, farmers worship the god of the fields, each with rice dumplings, chicken, millet, melon, and vegetable offerings at the crossroads of the fields, bowing twice and offering blessings, which is called Zhai Tiantou (斋田頭, fasting the field head).

Those who are fond of such things collect money and form associations, gather monks, set up altars for rites and chanting sutras, capture lonely souls, judge *hu* (斛, a unit of volume) and distribute food, release *Yan Kou* (flaming mouths, spirits suffering from starvation), burn a stack of paper money, beat gongs, and mix in [omission], burning in the streets and corners of the city, called [omission]. *Yi Shi Yao* (绎氏要), *Meng Lan* (孟兰), a 天竺 (India) term, is like saying upside down, an emergency rescue device. Thus, it has been passed down as a Buddhist saying. Also, on the night of the Hungry Ghost Festival, lanterns are released along the river, called illuminating the dark. Wu Manyun's Preface to *Jiang Xiang Festival Items* says: "The custom is to cut paper into lanterns like lotuses, and burn them, saying that it illuminates the suffering of the underworld, but this is done on the last day of the seventh month, not on the Hungry Ghost Festival."

On the twentieth day, according to popular tradition, it is the birthday of cotton, and rain is taboo. There is a saying: "If it rains on the twentieth day of the seventh month, the cotton will not go to the store."

The thirtieth day is the birthday of Dizang Wang (地藏王, Ksitigarbha), and there is a custom for women to take off their skirts. The skirts are made of red paper, and it is said that for every birth, a skirt is taken off once, so that in the next life they can avoid the hardship of childbirth. At dusk, every household puts incense and candles on the steps of the courtyard. There are also those who use lotus lanterns and burn dog excretion incense to make offerings. Jiang Yuanxi's poem says: "The golden immortal转劫降東瀛 (transmigrates to the east), the teaching master comes from the day of the full moon. A little Zen lamp is divided into real flames, and all the darkness is illuminated."

### Magpie Bridge Fairy

— On the Double Seventh Day of *Ding Hai* (1947)

In a tavern in a remote place, by the swimming pool; the enchanting scenery is like a thread, and every night the Double Seventh Day is merry! Sigh, how many times do the twin stars meet?

War clothes soaked with tears, the weaving machine is interrupted; foreign goods flood thousands of miles, manufacturers stop production, suffering and longing for each other, envying the cowherd and weaver girl talking about farming and weaving!

### Random Thoughts on the Double Seventh Festival

— Shufeng

The scorching heat of *Xunnan* has passed, and in an instant, it will be the season of "yellow leaves dancing in the autumn wind." Gazing up at the Milky Way at night, facing the twinkling stars, I am stirred by boundless deep feelings.

According to *Shi Wu Ji Yuan* (事物紀原, Records of the Origins of Things): "King Huai of Chu first established the Double Seventh Festival." Judging from this sentence, it can be known that the origin of the Double Seventh Festival has a splendid and long history of thousands of years. The myth of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's "meeting on the magpie bridge" has also been widely circulated as early as before the Li Tang Dynasty. As for calling the Double Seventh Festival the "Daughters' Festival," it is not without basis, because in ancient times, women were everywhere restricted by rituals and had few opportunities to freely revel all day long. Only on this day of the Double Seventh Festival could they do so. The sentence in "The Peacock Flies Southeast" says, "On the seventh and ninth days of the first lunar month, let us play and frolic and not forget each other." The seventh day refers to the Double Seventh Festival, which says that the Double Seventh Festival was the festival of revelry for women in ancient times. Therefore, the ancients fabricated the story of the "heavenly match." It was not only for embellishment but also had its factors and significance.

Although the Double Seventh Festival refers to the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, before the Song Dynasty, the sixth day of the seventh lunar month was also regarded as the Double Seventh Festival. According to [omission], the "begging for skills" day of the people in the capital at that time was entirely because of the different left and right compartments, such as taking the sixth and seventh days as the Double Seventh Festival. It was not until the third year of the *Taiping Xingguo* reign (978 CE) that Emperor Taizong of Song issued an edict to determine the seventh day of the seventh lunar month as the Double Seventh Festival. The edict said: "The Double Seventh auspicious day, written in the order, the current customs mostly use the sixth day, which is not the old system, it should be restored to using the seventh day." In order to "should be restored to using the seventh day," the imperial court even specially issued an edict to establish it. This shows how popular the trend of taking the sixth day of the seventh lunar month as the Double Seventh Festival must have been at the time. However, this trend has not been seen in Tang people's books, so it may have originated in the Five Dynasties period.

Speaking of the Mid-Autumn Festival, everyone will think of the legendary story of Emperor Ming of Tang's visit to the Moon Palace, but few know that Emperor Ming of Tang's relationship with the Double Seventh Festival is truly intimate. *Kaiyuan Tianbao Remains* records: "Emperor Ming and Consort Yang had a banquet on the Double Seventh Festival in the Huaqing Palace, arranged wine and fruits in the courtyard, sought favor from the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars, and each caught spiders in small boxes. At dawn, they used the density of the silk webs as a sign of skill. Even today, men and women imitate them." And the *Song of Everlasting Regret* states: "In the seventh month of autumn, on the evening of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's meeting, the customs of the people of Qin were that on this night, they displayed embroidered fabrics, arranged food and drink, planted melons and fruits, and burned incense in the courtyard, called begging for skills. It was especially popular in the palace." I can't help but secretly sigh for Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, who, even in the midst of military affairs, still had such elegant interests. Looking back at the present, every time the Double Seventh Festival comes, in addition to a few theaters routinely staging a few performances of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl's heavenly match as an embellishment, it is the seasonal fruits and foods supplied by food stores once a year. There is no other Double Seventh Festival atmosphere. It just points out that the folk people no longer have the interest in begging for skills that the ancients had.

### Double Seventh Festival Research

— Xu Ren

The Cowherd and Weaver Girl double stars cross the Milky Way on the night of the seventh day of the seventh lunar month for their annual reunion. This myth began in the Han Dynasty. Ying Shao of the Eastern Han Dynasty said: "The Weaver Girl crosses the river on the Double Seventh Festival, and magpies form a bridge." This is the earliest record of the Double Seventh Festival.

In the Eastern Han Dynasty, on the evening of the Double Seventh Festival, wine and meat were set up to [omission] the stars, and people stayed up until late at night without sleeping. If they saw a kind of glory appearing in the sky [omission] the double stars crossing the river.

In the Jin Dynasty, the customs of the Double Seventh Festival were also to set up wine, meat, fruits, and cakes, scatter incense powder on the table, and pray to the stars for wealth, longevity, or to be blessed with sons, but only one could be requested, not more.

In the Six Dynasties, in addition to offering melons and fruits, women used colored threads to thread seven-hole needles. The needles were made of gold and silver. The meaning of threading the needles was to ask the Weaver Girl to grant them skillful skills in needlework. If a spider's web was found on a melon or fruit that night, it was considered a sign that the request had been granted. This threading of needles is the origin of what the world calls "begging for skills." The reason why the Double Seventh Festival is also called the Begging for Skills Festival is due to this.

Emperor Ming of Tang, the amorous emperor of the Tang Dynasty, attached great importance to the Double Seventh Festival. Every year on the night of the Double Seventh Festival, he and Yang Guifei (Consort Yang) held a grand banquet in the Huaqing Palace to enjoy music. Bai Juyi's *Song of Everlasting Regret* says that Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Taizhen "On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Palace of Eternal Life, in the middle of the night, no one was there to whisper." It is indeed a factual record.

By the Song Dynasty, the patterns were even more distinctive and novel. *Meng Hua Lu*, written by a Song person, says: "On the Double Seventh Festival, soil is laid on a small board, and millet is planted to make seedlings grow. Small thatched houses, flowers, and trees are placed, and small figures of farmhouses are made, all in the state of villages, called grain board. Various patterns are carved on melons, called flower melons. Smiling faces are made of oily dough, sugar, and honey, called fruits and foods, with ingenious and varied patterns. Also, tea, beans, small beans, and wheat are soaked in water in porcelain containers, growing several inches, and tied with red and blue silk, called planting life. 彩模 (Color molds) are set up in the street center to sell goods."

### Cactus Flower

— Photo presented by Gong Xinyuan

This "Cactus Flower" photo is clear and lovely. The shape of the flower is unusually similar to what is generally called Epiphyllum (昙花, a type of flower), which is sufficient to prove that the so-called "Epiphyllum" is indeed a cactus family plant, and is specially published here to remove all mysterious atmospheres about Epiphyllum. According to the cactus family, there are a total of 20 genera and 1,500 species. "Cactus ball" and the commonly called "Epiphyllum" are two plants of the same family but different genera. Cactus ball is a plant of the "Cactus ball genus", and the genus and species names of Epiphyllum have not yet been determined, or it is said that it should belong to the "Leaf Cactus genus", but it is not yet certain.
