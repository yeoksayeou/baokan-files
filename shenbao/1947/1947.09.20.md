After that, he will depart for Taiwan, Central China, and South China for a second inspection tour.

Mr. Zhang plans to stay in Shenyang for three days to investigate general administrative affairs and intends to inspect the mines in Fushun and Anshan before proceeding to Changchun. Mr. Zhang stated that he would adhere to the principles of "seeing more, speaking less, and eating less" during his stay in the Northeast to gain as much as possible. In addition, it was learned that Lu Han was invited by Chen Cheng to Shenyang to console and inspect the Yunnan provincial troops in the Northeast. Mr. Lu stated that he was here to take a look and brought mustard greens, canned goods, and other Yunnan specialties to赠与 his Yunnan colleagues.

### President Zhang's Remarks in Shenyang: The Situation of Northeast Imports Exceeding Exports Must Be Improved; A Solution Must Be Found to Alleviate the Suffering of the People

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 19th] Zhang Qun stated at a press conference at 4:00 PM on the 19th: "The fact that I came to the Northeast on my first trip after taking charge of the Executive Yuan shows that the central government attaches importance to the Northeast and seeks to solve the problems of the Northeast. Recovering the Northeast, stabilizing the Northeast, and developing the Northeast are the unchanging policies of our country. All compatriots, generation after generation, will work towards this goal. In the past, the Northeast was a surplus area; now it is in deficit. We must urgently seek to improve this. I will also observe the actual situation of the people's hardships and seek ways to alleviate them. The unreasonable phenomena, such as transporting steel out of the Northeast in exchange for foreign cigarettes and the products of the Northeast Locomotive Factory being turned over to the Ministry without being fully utilized, must be carefully studied and improved. The situation is good after the implementation of the revised import/export and foreign exchange settlement methods. The export figures have increased, reaching over 37 billion yuan in Tianjin last month. Regarding the general election, the government has never considered postponing it. The Kuomintang has stipulated a bottom-up method for nominating parties. The Democratic and Youth parties are also processing it, but there is no ratio regulation. Our country's diplomacy has always maintained an independent stance and is not affected by the content of the Wedemeyer Report. For example, in the preliminary peace conference with Japan, our country mainly proposed that the two-thirds voting system of the eleven countries should include three of the four major powers. Regarding the veto issue, our country advocates that the veto power should not be used for suggestive cases, but it should be used for destructive cases. These two major issues are different from the United States and the Soviet Union. Regarding the issue of receiving Dalian, I firmly advocate sending troops there, because Dalian is a free port in terms of commerce, and in terms of national sovereignty, our army must go to receive it, but negotiations have not yet been successfully concluded."

### If the Veto Issue Is Not Resolved, We Will Not Participate in the Peace Conference; Foreign Minister Wang Talks About China's Stance on the Peace Treaty with Japan; Advocates Submitting to the Far Eastern Commission for Discussion First

[United Press, New York, 19th] Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Shijie declared in an exclusive interview with a United Press reporter on the 19th that if the United States invites the eleven nations to immediately convene a peace conference with Japan, China will reject it along with the Soviet Union. Mr. Wang stated: "The reason why China cannot accept the US invitation is the same as that of the Soviet Union, that is, the US proposal does not include the veto power of the four major powers. China fought hard for a long time before it was able to defeat Japan. If the peace conference cannot guarantee its rights and interests, China will not be able to participate. However, the Chinese government intends to compromise between the positions of the US and the Soviet Union and requests that the issue of the peace treaty with Japan be transferred to the Eleven-Nation Far Eastern Commission for discussion. This suggestion by small countries is higher than the Soviet Union's suggestion of a four-power conference, because it allows more countries that fought against Japan to have representatives present. At the same time, the procedures of the Far Eastern Commission have long guaranteed that the four major powers will reach a consensus." He hoped that this suggestion would be accepted by Washington and added: "If the deadlock in convening a peace conference in this way can be broken and the peace treaty can finally be fully agreed upon, I believe that the world situation will greatly improve."

Mr. Wang predicted that this session of the General Assembly would achieve very little in resolving world tensions. The basic problem facing the world is that there is still no peace two years after the end of the war. The United Nations General Assembly agenda does not consider this issue at all.

### Foreign Minister Wang's Speech in Chinese; Simultaneously Translated into English and French

Representatives from Various Countries Listen Quietly with Headphones

[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 18th] Foreign Minister Wang's opening remarks at the United Nations General Assembly today were actually the first important speech made in the Chinese language at the United Nations General Assembly. When Foreign Minister Wang stepped onto the podium, applause thundered. Representatives from the 55 countries immediately used headphones to listen to his speech. The speech lasted 15 minutes. Cameras, movie cameras, and television cameras all turned, and silver light shone. Because there were talents and equipment available in the venue, Foreign Minister Wang's English and French translations of his speech were simultaneously transmitted from the headphones in the two languages commonly used by the General Assembly. This was the first use of the new system this year. Any speech delivered in any of the five official languages of English, French, Chinese, Russian, and Spanish is simultaneously translated into English and French. Representatives can listen by wearing their headphones.

[Another Cable] Shortly after Foreign Minister Wang delivered his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, he held his first press conference. The Foreign Minister stated that China supports the US proposal and advocates that the General Assembly discuss methods and ways to assist Korea in achieving independence as soon as possible. Mr. Wang reviewed the Korean situation and stated that it is doubtful whether the General Assembly can reach a satisfactory plan to resolve the Korean issue. The key to resolving the Korean issue lies in whether China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union can reach an agreement on any plan resolved by the General Assembly.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Foreign Ministry's Committee for Reviewing the Peace Treaty with Japan held a meeting at 5:00 PM on the 19th, chaired by Vice Minister Liu Shishun. Those present included Wu Dingchang, Hu Huanyong, Liu Keshu, Jian Guansan, De Bai, Yu Shude, Wan Can, Zhang Qingzhen, Liu Shidu, and Huang Zhengming, totaling more than ten people. During the meeting, they extensively exchanged views on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. They all agreed that if the Soviet Union does not participate, China should not participate either. Regarding the voting rights issue, most people believed that the "four-country agreement right" was the most appropriate. Regarding the survival of the emperor system, Wu Dingchang believed that the words "Emperor" were inappropriate and should be changed to "Japanese Emperor" or "Japanese King". In addition, issues such as reparations and armaments were mentioned, and the basic policies on Japan after its surrender drafted by the Far Eastern Commission were discussed.

### Proposals for the Peace Treaty Are Amended and Approved by the Resident Committee

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The "Proposal on the Propositions Regarding the Peace Treaty with Japan" drafted by the People's Political Council's Research Association on Policies Towards Japan was submitted for discussion at the Resident Committee of the People's Political Council held on the morning of the 19th. It was amended by Secretary-General Bu Lizi and others and decided to be changed to a proposal. At the same time, it was decided that the preamble of the proposal could be passed. The wording of the latter part of the clauses still needs to be considered. Except for the first and second clauses of the procedural part, which were passed and published along with the preamble first and sent to the government for reference, the remaining clauses will be reviewed again. When the proposal was submitted for discussion, most of the councilors believed that the sentence "The signing of the peace treaty should insist on being held in Shenyang, China on September 18" listed in Article 14 was too rigid and contained sufficient retaliatory meaning and should be amended. It was then decided to change it to "The signing of the peace treaty should be held in China."

### Petrov Will Return to His Post; Sino-Soviet Relations May Enter a Better Phase

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Soviet Ambassador to China Petrov may return to his post in Nanjing in the near future. Our embassy in the Soviet Union has applied for his passport visa. The Soviet Embassy here has confirmed this today, but the exact date is still unknown. According to authoritative sources, as a result of paying attention to and adopting China's recent attitude and actions in diplomacy, the Soviet Union has a better understanding than before, and the excessive doubts of the past have been greatly reduced. The return of Petrov not only brings hope that some of the knots between China and the Soviet Union will be resolved, but also contains a very important significance. Sino-Soviet relations may enter a better phase, and close cooperation in some international affairs will promote friendship between the two countries.

### Guan Jiyu Will Be Appointed Vice Minister of Food

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 19th] Guan Jiyu will be transferred to Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food and will go to Beijing soon.

### The Ministry of Food Adapts to Current Needs; Formulates Measures for Food Re-Export; Purchase by Food Merchants and Institutions Must Be Approved

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Regarding food management and re-export, the person in charge of the Ministry of Food recently stated: "In recent years, our country's food policy has always adhered to the principle of free circulation of domestic food in order to achieve the effect of mutual replenishment. Now is a time of mobilization and suppression of chaos. Military and civilian food are extremely important. To meet the needs, appropriate management must be implemented for the current food in various regions, and measures for food re-export have been formulated and approved for implementation. The main significance is three points: (1) to avoid food aid to bandits; (2) to prevent food from flowing out; (3) to strictly prevent unscrupulous food merchants from engaging in hoarding and speculation with their large amounts of capital. This year, the provinces along the Yangtze River have reported harvests, while the provinces in North China have suffered successive droughts and floods. The floods in Guangdong and Guangxi are also extremely serious. Relief for the victims requires food urgently. Most of the military food required this year and next year must also be prepared in the provinces along the Yangtze River due to the disaster situation in North China. Therefore, how should the purchase and transportation quantities be properly stipulated so that the producing areas will not stimulate food prices due to excessive purchases, the sales areas will obtain considerable regulation, and the military food supply will be guaranteed? The formulation of measures for food re-export is actually a necessary measure to adapt to the current needs. Legal food merchants only need to comply with the application procedures and the documents submitted to apply for the purchase of food, and they can be approved. If there are any illegal acts due to the application for the purchase of food, once verified, no matter who it is, they shall be liable for legal responsibility. If the municipal governments or institutions and legal entities of the north and south provinces need to purchase food from the provinces along the Yangtze River, they should also apply to the Ministry in accordance with the regulations in order to arrange it as a whole, and they should not send personnel to purchase from various places first. Moreover, all institutions and legal entities must entrust legal food merchants to handle the food they entrusted to purchase and transport and must supervise them to ensure that the food arrives and is used locally. Do not allow merchants to get rid of the old ones midway and make profits from them. Moreover, for the food that is handled, the next batch can only be started after the first batch arrives. The Ministry will only approve the shipment of the next batch of food after each merchant has sold a batch of food that has been purchased and transported by a legal food merchant. I hope that all sectors will fully cooperate so that the government's food policy can be implemented satisfactorily."

### US Criticism of China; Praised Excessively in the Past and Criticized Harshly Today; Foreign Minister Wang Says Both Are Excessive

[Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 18th] Since Foreign Minister Wang arrived in the United States, he has been asked by various parties for his views on the recent US criticism of China. The Foreign Minister replied today: "Both the US praise in the past and the US criticism today are excessive." At his first press conference for Chinese reporters, Mr. Wang recalled that five or six years ago, US public opinion and the people all considered China to be perfect and praised it excessively. At that time, China was actually ashamed of it. Now, most American newspapers and commentators are moving to the other extreme. The Foreign Minister hopes that Americans can view the situation in China with appropriate eyes and not change from one extreme to the other.

The workers are demanding a 200% wage increase, while the management has only agreed to a 40% increase. At the same time, workers in Hong Kong's major public utilities have also filed requests for wage increases, so the tram workers' strike may trigger strikes by workers in other public utilities.

### Wedemeyer Recommends to Truman That the US Continue Economic Aid to China; The Investigative Report Is Forwarded by Lovett

[United Press, Washington, 18th] General Wedemeyer arrived here at 10:38 AM on the 18th (0:38 AM on the 19th, Shanghai time). According to Wedemeyer's news advisor, Watson, Wedemeyer's recommendation includes a recommendation that the United States continue economic aid to China. The full text is very long, with thousands of words and many attachments. General Wedemeyer refused to comment when he arrived at the airport with his entourage. Watson also said that the date for Wedemeyer's audience with the President has not been set. The date will probably be decided after Lovett reads his report. So far, unless Lovett or President Truman decides otherwise, Wedemeyer can be said to have completed his mission.

[US News Agency, Washington, 18th] Wedemeyer's report was completed during his stopover in Hawaii and is likely to be submitted to Acting Secretary of State Lovett on Friday. Wedemeyer will then resume his position as commander of the Second Army (at Fort Meade in Maryland).

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] Wedemeyer arrived in Washington today and brought with him a complete report of thousands of words after his investigation into the facts in our country, as well as recommendations to Truman regarding the next steps the United States should take in the Far East. Wedemeyer refused to comment on his trip to China at the airport and left for nearby Fort Meade to resume his duties as commander of the Second Army. Wedemeyer is scheduled to submit the report to Acting Secretary of State Lovett tomorrow. The date of his meeting with Truman has not been set, but according to Wedemeyer's spokesman, reports to the President during Marshall's absence will first go through Lovett and then to the White House. It is rumored that Wedemeyer brought three large boxes of secret documents from our country. Wedemeyer's spokesman said that a large amount of information obtained from the investigation in China has been included in the thousands of words in the report and there is a huge appendix, so the report is quite long. The spokesman continued that unless Acting Secretary of State Lovett wants General Wedemeyer to return to China, Wedemeyer's mission to China can be considered complete after the report is submitted to the President. He declined to clarify whether the above can be interpreted as the State Department wanting Wedemeyer to return to China as the US ambassador to China.

### Conference of Councilors' Standing Committee: Chen Qitian Reports on Economic Measures, Plans Textile Industry Initiatives, Urges Coal Mine Resumption and Increased Production

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Economic Minister Chen Qitian attended the Conference of Councilors' Standing Committee on the morning of the 19th to report on the implementation of government policies, roughly divided into two parts: (1) Supporting private enterprises to increase production capacity, and (2) Encouraging international trade to earn foreign exchange and balance payments. Chen then elaborated on the coal mining and textile industries. Regarding the coal mining industry, due to the impact of the Northeast war, coal shortages have become widespread. He has discussed with the Ministry of National Defense to find ways to protect mines, and at the same time, discussed with the Four Banks Joint Office to seek loans for increased production and expansion. As for the current state of the textile industry, China currently has over four million spindles, but not all of them are operating. Experts estimate that 15 million spindles are needed to meet demand, so there is a significant shortfall. Furthermore, China currently only exports textiles, so the textile industry urgently needs improvement. In terms of supporting private industry, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established industrial and commercial guidance offices in major cities such as Shanghai, Yunnan, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. It is planned that the survey of the overall situation and actual conditions of factories in major cities across the country will be completed within this year. Then development and expansion can be further sought. Regarding the allocation and supply of factory equipment, a general warehouse for factory equipment was established during the war, but it was abolished after the victory. The part of factory equipment under its jurisdiction was transferred to the Materials Supply Bureau, which was very inconvenient for manufacturers. Therefore, it has now been discussed with the Four Banks Joint Office to grant manufacturers more foreign exchange for the purchase of factory equipment to facilitate imports, and a factory equipment group has been established under the industrial and commercial guidance offices. Regarding the adjustment of the production and sales of yarn and cloth, the first step is to increase cotton production. According to statistics, this year's harvest has doubled compared to last year, from five million dan last year to eleven million dan this year. To meet the needs of the national population, there is still a shortage of one-third. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has established a cotton production improvement office, with 45 billion allocated for promotion and improvement, hoping to increase production next year. Secondly, regarding the price of yarn from the Central Textile Corporation, since the establishment of the Textile Management Committee, yarn prices have been subject to dynamic negotiation, so the current situation has improved. The third step is to purchase spring cocoons. This spring, a total of 270 billion was lent to purchase spring cocoons from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces for foreign exchange. Now the autumn cocoons are coming onto the market, and 133 billion has already been loaned, with 33 billion used to purchase Sichuan cocoons, and the rest for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] At the meeting of the Councilors' Standing Committee on the morning of the 19th, after Economic Minister Chen Qitian finished his report, councilors raised inquiries and suggestions one after another, which Minister Chen answered. It was learned from Chen's replies that: (1) The Ministry of Economic Affairs is formulating a five- to ten-year plan for the textile industry, and is also paying attention to the establishment of yarn mills in different regions (especially in cotton-producing areas). (2) The Beijing-Shanghai area needs 260,000 tons of coal per month, mainly from the Kailuan Coal Mine, which supplies about 100,000 tons per month, and the Huainan Coal Mine, which supplies about 40,000 tons. The rest is supplied by coal mines in Taiwan. The Ministry is currently urging coal mines along the Yangtze River that have not resumed work to resume work as soon as possible.

Chen Qitian Answers Various Inquiries: More Advantages Than Disadvantages in Trade with Japan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] After reporting on the general situation of the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the Conference of Councilors' Standing Committee on the morning of the 19th, Economic Minister Chen Qitian answered inquiries from various councilors.

Wu Chunwu first inquired about the issue of trade with Japan. Since the initiative is in our hands, but according to the facts, Japan exports industrial products, while China still exports agricultural products, will we fall into the old trap of surrendering to Japan's aggressive policy (agricultural China, industrial Japan)? Therefore, should the opening of trade with Japan be reconsidered? Chen replied that the opening of trade with Japan is a fait accompli. We can only say whether to participate or not. If China does not participate, it will not have much impact on Japan, but it will have an impact on our country. The State Council decided to participate, and the Executive Yuan is only implementing the policy. The Ministry of Economic Affairs can only impose strict restrictions on management. Chen also believes that this is trade between Chinese people and Japanese people, not trade between Japanese people and Chinese people. The initiative is in our hands, and there are more advantages than disadvantages.

Xue Mingjian inquired about the reasons for the increase in electricity prices. Chen replied that there are three reasons for the increase in electricity prices: (1) General price increases. (2) The addition of machinery requires expensive foreign exchange, resulting in excessive costs. (3) Labor wages are too high. The government plans to set a standard for the prices of various public utilities and set prices according to the standard. The government is currently determining the standard and its calculation method.

Chen Shaoxian inquired that we need a lot of cotton, but it is best to develop and increase production as much as possible to achieve self-sufficiency. At the same time, he suggested that the government purchase Indian cotton to avoid a large consumption of US dollars. Chen replied that the Cotton Production Management Office will try its best to enable all cotton-producing areas in the country to promote increased production. Regarding the purchase of Indian cotton, the Central Textile Corporation has recently ordered a portion. Recently, it has purchased US cotton three times, the first time 40 million dan, the second time 20 million dan, and the third time 25 million dan. The reason for purchasing US cotton is that US cotton does not require cash payment, but is a loan, while Indian cotton requires cash payment. Regarding the management of the domestic textile industry, the Central Textile Corporation is currently evaluating the price. It has been decided that 30% will be retained by the state, and the remaining 70% will be sold. The method will be formulated by the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises.

Yin Shuxian said: Wei Demai's criticism of the government is that it is incompetent and corrupt, and there are two examples to prove it. One is regarding corruption. When the Fuel Management Committee transports coal from Jinpu Road to Shanghai, it must pass through Pukou. However, it must be inspected at Pukou Station. If the inspection is delayed by one day, it will be fined. Therefore, the inspectors can arbitrarily delay the time. Those who are inspected are willing to pay various fees in advance to bribe and advance the time for fear of being fined. This is the first example. The price of yarn from the Central Textile Corporation is set at 500,000 yuan per piece, while the outside price is 1 million yuan. Even if foreigners obtain the approval of the Textile Management Committee, they must pay a package fee of 400,000 yuan per piece to the person in charge. This is the second example. Another example is the Three Gorges Water Conservancy Power Generation Plan of Saffani, which should be started immediately. Chen replied that he could investigate it, but there are already improvement measures.

Measures to Encourage Young People to Study Abroad: Decision to Submit to the Government for Reference

Postponement of Various Election Cases Reserved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] The Councilors' Standing Committee held its fifth meeting on the morning of the 19th, chaired by Jiang Yong. Economic Minister Chen Qitian attended to report on current economic measures and the recent work of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and answered inquiries from various councilors in detail. Then, proposals were discussed: (1) A proposal to request the government to encourage outstanding young people to study and investigate abroad to contribute to the revival and benefit the nation-building, which stated in the measures: "For self-funded students who have obtained permission from foreign universities and have been awarded scholarships or subsidies, regardless of whether they have graduated from domestic universities, the Ministry of Education should uniformly issue study abroad certificates so that they can go abroad for further studies." After discussion, it was decided to submit it to the government for reference. (2) A proposal to request the government to postpone various election cases. The original proposal listed two measures: (1) Request the government to promptly solicit the opinions of representatives of various countries by means of communication, and (2) Request the government to promptly convene a meeting of the Legislative Committee to discuss the issue of postponing the elections. The proposer, Cai Zhisheng, stood up and explained, emphasizing that the current period is not a suitable time and environment for elections. After the councilors spoke, they believed that the proposal was submitted too late. The government is already actively promoting election affairs, so it is not necessary to submit it again. It was decided that the case would be reserved.

### Jiaodong Bandits Disperse, Chinese Troops Mop Up by District, Expected to Pacify Entirely Before Month's End, Western Shandong Bandits Attempt to Flee Across Eastern Section of Longhai Railway

[Our Weixian Dispatch, 19th] Since the Chinese troops recaptured Laiyang, the location of the Communist Bandit Jiaodong Military Region Headquarters, on the 18th, the bandit's one column, four newly formed divisions, and local teams, located in Jiaodong, lost their eastern heart and dispersed, hiding in the surrounding villages and adopting guerrilla tactics. Currently, the Chinese troops are mopping up by district, hoping to completely pacify Jiaodong before the end of this month.

[United Press, Qingdao, 19th] The Chinese troop authorities here claimed today that after the recapture of Laiyang, it is only 50 miles north of Yantai, and the gateway is wide open. The Chinese troops are expected to directly attack Yantai and celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.

### Chen Qitian Reports on Economic Measures, Continued from Page 2: Price Fluctuations in June, July, and August

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Economic Minister Chen Qitian reported on the price issue at the Conference of Councilors' Standing Committee on the 19th, giving a detailed analysis of the price fluctuations in June, July, and August. Chen first stated that the basic reasons for price fluctuations after the war were nothing more than (1) fiscal imbalance, continuous increase in currency, (2) production stagnation, lack of materials, (3) traffic disruption, stagnation of freight, and (4) rampant speculation, prevalence of speculation. This year's prices began to fluctuate in April. The short-term stability created by the emergency economic measures was completely shaken. It was not until mid-May that it began to stabilize slightly. At that time, the national average price was about 19.685 times that before the war. Chen then analyzed the price fluctuations in June, July, and August, saying that the price index for June was 2,564.256, which is the average wholesale price index of the six major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan (with the first half of the 26th year as the base period in June). In the first two weeks of this month, general prices continued to show a steady state. By the last week, however, waves arose again. Black market foreign exchange rose nearly doubled in a week, and various prices also rose sharply. In this month, the average increase rate of the six major cities compared to the previous month was 21%. The reasons were: (1) Loose monetary policy, abundant speculation, (2) Wages increased greatly due to unfreezing, (3) Cancellation of subsidies for public utilities, successive price adjustments, (4) The expiration of the US Import-Export Bank's US$500 million loan, (5) The emergency situation in North China, and the surge of speculation moving south. The price index for July was 3,115.492. The so-called July price surge was not as large as predicted. The reasons were: (1) The arrival of Special Envoy Wei Demai made the market psychologically believe that it was the prelude to US aid to China, and the Chinese economic situation could improve, (2) The US State Department issued a joint announcement that private trade with Japan would be opened from August 15, and cheap Japanese industrial products might be thrown into the Far East market to compete, (3) In early July, the "Economic Supervision Council" was established in Shanghai, and it was decided to set up investigation teams for gold, banknotes, cotton yarn, food, fuel, and edible oil to strictly enforce inspection work, (4) National banks and bureaus actively tightened their positions, and (5) The stability of the battle situation in Northeast and North China, and the return of speculation. In the first half of July, Shanghai's monetary policy was extremely tight, and prices had no power to rise. However, although other places followed Shanghai's lead, the rise was still very fierce due to the later response. The average increase rate of the six major cities in August compared to the previous month was 21%. The price index for August was 3,458.749. Although the price increase rates in various places were uneven, they were generally stable. The reasons were: (1) This month is the busy farming season, and the market is relatively sluggish, (2) The food harvest in various places is still considered abundant, (3) The government revised the foreign exchange management and import and export trade methods, and the market response was still good, (4) The battle situation in Shandong and other places improved, and (5) The outlines for the implementation of the suppression of the rebellion were gradually implemented, and the price control work was strengthened, and people's hearts were more stable. This month is only halfway through, and prices in various places seem to have an upward trend again, with rice, food, yarn, and cloth rising particularly sharply. The reasons were: (1) Wei Demai's departure statement showed that US economic assistance was still under consideration, (2) Japanese goods could not pour in and dump due to the strict restrictions in our country, (3) Bandit troops roamed Hubei and Anhui in central China, and speculation moved eastward, and (4) The official prices of British exchange and gold rose slightly. As for the two items of materials, yarn, cloth, and coal under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Minister Chen believed that the fluctuation situation since April was still relatively gentle compared to general prices, and both July and August showed a downward trend. As for the price of bituminous coal, the increase rate in July still exceeded that of general prices, but this was because the subsidies were canceled, so the rise was inevitably steeper. However, if the average price index of January before the implementation of the subsidies is calculated, it is still not seen to exceed general prices.

### Continued Mopping-Up in Northern Jiangsu, Zhang Xuezhong Goes to Lianshui for Inspection

[Our Huaiyin Dispatch, 19th] The troops of the Hongze Lake Chinese Army who advanced and suppressed bandits completely defeated about 1,000 bandits of Zhang Jinchen and Wei Longshou on the northwest bank of Gaoyou Lake in the Caihuaziqiao and Yinjiaji areas in the past two days.

### Trial of Zhonghe Bridge Massacre Completed: Savani Declared Not Guilty

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Savani, an accomplice in the Zhonghe Bridge Massacre, was declared not guilty by the US military court on the 19th and released in court. Savani's part of the case was tried for four days from the 15th. Because the testimony of the main witness Tu Chonghai was contradictory and other witnesses failed to prove that Savani conspired with Arrey or got out of the car to commit the crime, the verdict was not guilty. Savani was overjoyed after hearing the verdict and saluted the judge to thank him and shook hands with his defense lawyers to congratulate each other. This criminal part of the absurd case of drowning two people has come to an end. As for the civil part of the compensation, a spokesman for the US military advisory group told reporters that the total amount of salary that the victims Wang Shouben and Lu Huatian (both military officers) should have received within five years will be paid, but if the amount exceeds US$5,000, it must be approved by Congress. This matter is currently being handled by the US Damage Compensation Committee in Shanghai.

### Wuxi Grain Merchants Hoarding and Raising Prices: Seven Grain Store Owners Detained, Temporarily Released on Bail After Interrogation

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 19th] Recently, the grain price in the town has risen sharply due to the manipulation of unscrupulous grain merchants.

County Magistrate Xu Yuanruo, based on a secret report this morning that a large number of grain merchants were taking the opportunity to hoard and raise prices and privately transporting large quantities of grain out of the province, immediately secretly ordered the Food Bureau to send personnel to investigate and detained Zou Xinquan, Wu Bangjun, Ye Yinzhen, Xu Zhangsheng, Zhang Chengfu, Zou Fuzhi, and Cai Yaoqing, the owners of seven grain stores including Yongdasheng and Wu Changchun. In the afternoon, Deputy Director Yan personally opened a court for interrogation to thoroughly investigate their relief items and destinations of transportation in the past month. As a result, due to major suspicions, they were temporarily released on bail with substantial security to await punishment.

### Commemorative Ode for the 25,000th Issue of Shen Bao

Time passes, articles accumulate, month after month, year after year. Since the *Shen Bao* was first published, to this day, it has reached its 25,000th issue, and in terms of years, it has been seventy-five years. This cannot be said to be other than a brilliant page in modern cultural history. We cherish it, we applaud it, and it has its own profound significance, and should not be silently glossed over. Seventy is the age of antiquity in a human life. Speaking negatively, it may inevitably verge on decline; speaking positively, it is just the beginning of joyful attainment. Having experienced richness, its grand aspirations do not wane; in facing opportunities, it goes wherever it is fitting. The *Shen Bao* is just like this! Throughout the seventy-five years of its enduring history, like spreading ripples, it has gained thorough insight and silently observed the vicissitudes of change. Its experiences and trials advance with each passing day. Now, with its ever-renewing appearance, it provides readers with the most comprehensive and fulfilling service. Ceaseless innovation dispels the feeling of decline, and profound understanding of both bitterness and sweetness expands the way to respond to events. This is what we find privately gratifying in addition to our joy and excitement. The fact that *Shen Bao* has been able to flourish and continue uninterruptedly is truly due to the support of people from all walks of life, the readership of thousands upon thousands, and the nurturing of painstaking effort, the unsparing irrigation, the diligent gathering of dew, and the spiritual and physical investment of its staff. They deserve undeniable credit for their achievements. However, by the universal principle of natural evolution, the new replaces the old, and the talented depart. How can anyone living under the heavens transcend this limit? Looking back over the past decades, many colleagues have exhausted themselves and passed away, or retired due to old age and illness. The positions of these gentlemen may be gone, but their legacies endure. If we wish to maintain the *Shen Bao* for eternity, we must follow the standards set by our predecessors. As we cherish the loyalty of our predecessors, we must strive to expand the *Shen Bao* even further. Bearing heavy responsibilities, it is not easy to attend to everything. This, in addition to our joy, is what we find alarming and cautionary.

*Shen Bao* was first published in the eleventh year of the reign of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty, which corresponds to 1872 in the Western calendar. At that time, the influence of European and American trends had not yet fully spread. The Chinese people's awareness of newspapers was mostly ignorant. Aside from official gazettes, the only newspapers they occasionally saw were the Chinese-language newspapers from Hong Kong. The *Shen Bao* was the first to formally publish a newspaper. Although it was in its initial stages and the scale was not complete, the clear layout was already noteworthy. Compared with the London *Times* of England and the New York *Times* of America, it could not be compared, but it could at least follow in their footsteps. The birth of *Shen Bao* coincided with a time of many troubles for the nation. At that time, the Taiping Rebellion had just ended, and rebellions in Shaanxi and Gansu were gradually being suppressed. Superficially, the Qing Dynasty seemed to have the potential for development, but in reality, it was already in an irreversible decline. Subsequently, diplomacy deteriorated, and domestic affairs became increasingly corrupt. One turbulent situation followed another: there was the Sino-French conflict, the Sino-Japanese War, the Hundred Days' Reform, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Eight-Nation Alliance invasion. The *Shen Bao* witnessed and chronicled all these dangerous and difficult times. News spread rapidly, and even the smallest details were recorded. It allowed people in remote areas to communicate through a single piece of paper, and enlightened and awakened the minds of the closed-off populace. This was the contribution of *Shen Bao* in its youth, and the achievements it attained before the Republic of China.

With the fall of the Qing Dynasty, a new political system emerged. With its spirit of continuous self-improvement, *Shen Bao* assisted in the establishment of political and educational institutions. It took the lead in promoting justice and freedom and used its substantial strength to assist in the establishment of political and educational institutions. The beginnings were vast and cannot be fully described. In the past thirty-six years, the times have changed, and there have been many periods of tension and relaxation. The *Shen Bao*'s reporters have always been able to distinguish right from wrong and clearly show their support, such as recording the failure of Hong Xian's claim to the throne, the failure of Zhang Xun's restoration, the collapse of the Northern warlords, and the success of the National Revolution. Its arguments were unbiased, and its language was standardized. During the sacred War of Resistance, in times of hardship and urgency, with repeated adversities and frequent setbacks, it suffered particularly great trauma and unforgettable difficulties. Fortunately, in the midst of national jubilation, it was able to witness the restoration of the country, and the *Shen Bao* also gained its new life. Time flies, and two years have passed in a hurry. Although post-victory China has not yet recovered from its wounds, and wars continue to break out, people throughout the country, under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, are overcoming obstacles and working together with one heart, and it is expected that peaceful reunification will not be far off. With its long history, the *Shen Bao* seeks to promote post-disaster reconstruction, and should strive to be even more sharp and industrious so as not to fail the readers' trust and to fully perform the duty of a journalist. Taking this opportunity, I offer a piece of my humble sincerity, expressing our wishes and seeking correction from the readers.

First: Newspapers are tools for social education and have the function of subtle and gradual influence. The more advanced the culture, the greater the need for newspapers; the wider the readership, the greater the effectiveness of newspapers. Some people compare newspapers to the wands wielded by magicians, saying that they contain unlimited mystery. Others refer to newspapers as spiritual food, saying that they can satisfy the hunger and thirst for knowledge. The authority of newspapers lies in this, and the binding power of newspapers also lies in this. Because of its authority, reporting must be objective and truthful, and its authority must not be misused. Because of its binding power, commentary must be responsible and cautious, and one must not fall into bondage oneself. The news motto of the New York *Times* is: "Only what is worth printing is news." Bleyer also said: "Good news must be palatable to the majority of people." These are all valuable creeds and are very worthy of our consideration. *Shen Bao* has always adhered to prudence as its guiding principle and conformed to this spirit; in the future, it should adhere to its original position and never change.

Second: Newspapers are pioneers in promoting democratic politics and have the responsibility to guide society at the grassroots level. Our country's constitution has been established, and the general election is imminent. The display of the power of public opinion will become even more important. How to strive for effective performance and promote the realization of democratic politics is our pressing task. As for freedom of speech, it is certainly something to be striven for, but it also has its limits and cannot be abused. We firmly believe that the bad consequences of abusing freedom of speech are no different from destroying the true meaning of freedom of speech. The differences between these two should be clearly distinguished. We believe that the minimum belief of a journalist is: to appeal for those who have been wronged, to attack those who act arbitrarily and abuse their power, to ignore malicious slander, and to treat yellow journalism with contempt. We must use true freedom of speech as our standard and be the voice of the majority of good people.

Third: Newspapers advance with the times, and the world has the inherent ability to change. *Shen Bao* has been in the newspaper industry for seventy-five years. In terms of seniority, it is like an old horse, but in terms of ability, it can hardly be said to know the way. Therefore, we are determined to learn extensively and make progress and are determined not to be complacent and stick to the old ways. We will carefully consider the advantages of newspapers in advanced countries and the techniques they display and strive to learn from them. For example, the widespread distribution of communication networks, the emphasis on speed and efficiency in reporting, the constant improvement of printing, the effort to make layouts eye-catching, and the effort to achieve universal sales are all within our practical plans, with the aim of gradually achieving perfection. *Shen Bao* is one of the leading newspapers in the country, but compared with democratic countries such as Britain and the United States, there are still many things that are difficult to compare equally. Leaving aside other things, in terms of sales, the Chicago *Tribune* in the United States sells one million copies a day, and the Daily Express in the United Kingdom sells three million copies a day. Comparing them to us, there is a huge gap. However, we are quite confident that as a result of continuous efforts, there may be a day when we can catch up.

The reason why we do not hesitate to be so verbose is that seventy-five years is not a short period of time, and 25,000 issues is a considerable number. It is time to review and distinguish what we should have. Reflecting on the hard work of the past, we are all the more motivated to plan for the future! We always maintain a sense of caution, knowing that complacency is not a good plan. Let us take the 25,000th issue as a stage, then countless stages are still ahead. Mountain forests and distant roads, this is just the beginning. We sincerely hope to work together with our colleagues and earnestly seek cooperation from our readers, in order to achieve greater and deeper progress and to promote the boundless glory of the *Shen Bao*!

### Vyshinsky's Speech at the UN General Assembly: Directly Rejects US Proposals, Demands a Halt to Malicious Propaganda by Various Countries

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 18th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, in his address to the UN General Assembly today, categorically rejected Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation Interim Committee on Peace and Security, denouncing it as a manifestly unconstitutional proposal designed to circumvent the Security Council, and declared that the Soviet Union would fight vigorously against the proposal. After urging the Assembly to take punitive action against non-compliance with its directives, including the presence of US troops in China, Vyshinsky also introduced a resolution calling for a ban on the use of atomic weapons as military equipment by any country. The resolution also strongly condemned war profiteers and called on governments to impose criminal penalties on those engaged in war propaganda. Vyshinsky also sternly criticized Britain and the United States, accusing them of violating the founding principles of the UN and in some cases of directly defying the resolutions of the General Assembly. He pointed out that such policies of using UN agencies as tools for individual selfish and narrow interests are sufficient to weaken the position and strength of UN agencies.

Vyshinsky's points are summarized as follows: (1) The British and American attempts to disregard UN agencies, to break away from those agencies to implement their political measures, this policy is contrary to the Charter and the founding purpose of the UN agencies, the Assembly should pay serious attention to the threat posed by this policy.

(2) The most important setback in the activities of the UN is the unsatisfactory state of the disarmament plan. Britain and the United States are unwilling to disarm and have obstructed the realization of disarmament in many ways. Foreign Secretary Bevin's recent statement can explain why the disarmament issue is in such an unsatisfactory state. The announcement of the issue of atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction is particularly worrying. The Soviet Union has taken various steps to resolve the atomic issue, but they have all encountered resistance. The main resister is the United States. Although the Soviet Union intends to have strict international control of atomic energy, it can never accept foreign interference in atomic energy production plants.

### Criticizes US Aid to Europe Plan, Firmly Upholds Veto Power

(3) The Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe are both attempts to violate UN principles, intending to force other countries to accept their policies. The so-called US aid to Greece and Turkey is nothing more than a political weapon. The Marshall Plan for aid to Europe is an attempt to force European countries to rely on US monopoly capital, and is intended to form an alliance in Europe to oppose Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, dividing Europe into two major fronts.

(4) Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation Peace and Security Committee is an attempt to circumvent the Security Council and is a clear violation of the Charter. The Soviet delegation will oppose it. The Soviet Union demands unconditional compliance with the principle of unanimous agreement among the great powers. The Soviet Union will strive to uphold this principle, meaning resisting any attempt to amend the veto system.

### Involves the Presence of US Troops in China

(5) The UN General Assembly should take action on the following cases of non-compliance: (a) British troops stationed in Egypt, Greece, and Transjordan; (b) US troops stationed in China; (c) Argentina's disregard of the last General Assembly resolution by sending an ambassador to Madrid; (d) South Africa's failure to submit a trusteeship agreement for Southwest Africa.

(6) The Indonesian incident can absolutely only be described as an act of aggression.

(7) The Iranian issue should be removed from the Security Council agenda. The retention of this issue by Britain and the United States is clearly for a special purpose.

(8) The accusations against northern Greece are groundless accusations.

(9) The United States' submission of the Korean issue to the UN General Assembly is a violation of the Four-Power Moscow Agreement.

### Implies the Soviet Union Has No Intention of War

Vyshinsky said that the newspapers of some countries are already launching propaganda for a new war, especially the newspapers of the United States and countries subservient to the United States, such as Turkey, which have been engaged in frenzied propaganda to make public opinion support the outbreak of a new war. War profiteers are using fabricated news that the Soviet Union is preparing to attack the United States to stimulate the people, as a pretext for their own war preparations. The Soviet Union does not have the slightest intention of attacking any country, while some countries, especially the United States, have moved from a state of war mentality to taking concrete military strategic measures, including establishing new military bases, reorganizing their armies, expanding arms production, and improving combat weapons. Vyshinsky then questioned why the British and American Joint Chiefs of Staff are still maintained in Washington, more than two years after the end of the war.

Vyshinsky then introduced a resolution stating that the UN severely condemns the criminal new war propaganda launched by reactionary elements in some countries, especially the United States, Turkey, and Greece, which are disseminating various suggestive arguments through newspapers, movies, and public speeches. The UN believes that it is necessary to urge governments to prohibit any form of war propaganda, with violators subject to criminal penalties, and for governments to take preventive measures against dangerous war propaganda that harms the peace, national interests, and happiness.

### Why Doesn't the Soviet Union Set an Example and Withdraw Its Troops from North Korea First?

Statement by UN Observer from Korea

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] Ms. Yim Young-sin, a Korean observer attending the UN General Assembly, criticized Vyshinsky's speech, saying that in world history, apart from Hitler's masterpieces, it is extremely difficult to find a solemn diplomatic statement filled with such contradictions. Vyshinsky strives to demand that foreign troops withdraw from non-enemy countries. Of course, he specifically refers to the US troops stationed in China and other places, not to the Soviet troops stationed in North Korea. If, as Vyshinsky claims, the withdrawal of these troops would help to increase international confidence and build peace, then why doesn't the Soviet Union take the lead and withdraw from North Korea first? The Korean people unanimously believe that the Joint Commission has failed. In the two years after the so-called liberation, Korea's situation is worse than at any time in its history. Therefore, Marshall's efforts to put the Korean issue on the agenda are extremely justified.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] After US Secretary of State Marshall proposed that the Korean issue be submitted to the United Nations for discussion, various political parties and organizations here attached great importance to it. The Public Relations Minister of the Korean Democratic Party made a statement on this, saying, "The Democratic Party absolutely supports Mr. Marshall's proposal and hopes that the United Nations will resolve it satisfactorily."

### Various Reactions to the Soviet Representative's Speech

[Associated Press, New York, 19th] Today it was learned that after Soviet Representative Vyshinsky delivered a long speech of 8,000 words at the UN General Assembly, fiercely criticizing the American "war merchants," US Secretary of State Marshall, after receiving advice from other key members of the US delegation, will continue to strive to establish a peace organization, regardless of the Soviet Union's firm opposition.

[Associated Press, New York, 18th] Representatives from various countries have different views on Vyshinsky's speech. A few think it is "vivid," most think it is "severe," and some see it as purely "propaganda." However, Vyshinsky's assurance that the Soviet Union has no intention of launching a war has been taken seriously by all parties. British Chief Representative McNeil said, "This is an interesting speech, but most of the citations and accusations are clichés." French Representative Parodi said, "This is the most severe speech. This is a very important meeting." The initial reactions from the US Congress came from members of the House of Representatives. It is said that this kind of speech is the ultimate in slander. Syrian Representative Gojeh said that this speech was "thunder." It is said that "the most important thing is the Soviet Union's assurance that it has no intention of launching a war."

### Greek Deputy Prime Minister Flies to the US

[Reuters, Athens, 19th] Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsaldaris is scheduled to fly to New York tomorrow to attend the UN General Assembly. The newly appointed Minister without Portfolio, Liberal Party member Mylonas, will accompany him.

### The Soviet Union Monitors Developments at the UN General Assembly; Molotov Meets with Stalin

[Associated Press, Moscow, 18th] Foreign Minister Molotov went to the Black Sea area a few days ago to meet with Premier Stalin and has now returned here. Diplomats from various countries attach great importance to this, believing that Molotov is closely monitoring the various developments at the UN General Assembly. One diplomat believes that this General Assembly session poses a danger to the future of the world organization. The Soviet Union believes that the veto power is a tool to promote unanimous agreement among the five great powers. If it is to be abolished, it will cause danger. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to this issue. If this session seriously attacks the veto power, the Soviet Union will also strongly resist it.

### Representatives from Australia, Canada, etc. Criticize Abuse of Veto Power

Australia Advocates for Drafting Treaties with Germany and Japan

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 18th] Australia, Canada, and South Africa all delivered speeches in the general debate of the Assembly today, criticizing the abuse of the veto power and supporting the US proposal to establish an Interim Committee of the Assembly, demanding that the Assembly be given greater power to be the final arbiter of international disputes that threaten security and peace. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt frankly opposed the veto power and enthusiastically supported the Assembly, which prevailed over the Security Council. Evatt called for the prompt drafting of treaties with Germany and Japan. Chinese Chief Representative Luo Longji stated that people around the world must choose between the United Nations and the veto power in its current form. If the application of the veto power is not properly regulated, then we may lose both. Luo also enthusiastically supported Marshall's proposal and supported the US decision to include the Korean issue on the Assembly's agenda.

### UN Special Committee on Palestine Scheduled to Elect Members on Monday

### Showdown Between US and Soviet Union Inevitable

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] Representative Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who was denounced as one of the "war makers" by Soviet Representative Vyshinsky at the UN General Assembly, said in a nationwide broadcast after Vyshinsky's attack: "A showdown with the Soviet Union is inevitable." Eaton, apparently unmoved by Vyshinsky's condemnation, urged Americans to make it clear that the United States is determined to defend its freedom and "do its utmost to help other people" maintain their freedom. Eaton said, "We believe that a showdown with the Soviet Union is inevitable for three reasons: (1) The world is urgently required to choose one of two incompatible philosophies of life. (2) The Soviet Union has an aggressive ideology, its avowed purpose is to conquer the world with world revolution, its motives are extremely despicable and inhuman, like a hungry tiger. (3) Communism delusionally believes that if the US free government system and free capitalist enterprises are not weakened, the Soviet system will fail. Sooner or later, we will confront the Soviet Union, the embodiment of communism, head-on, and investigate whether the two can coexist in the modern world." Eaton also said, "The United States has decided to maintain its current leadership position in the United Nations at any cost. This position will serve as the cornerstone of our foreign policy."

### If the US Proposal Passes, the Soviet Union May Withdraw from the United Nations

[Reuters, New York, 10th] Representatives attending the UN General Assembly are today seriously discussing the possibility of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the UN. Some representatives believe that if the General Assembly passes the US proposal to establish a 55-nation Peace and Security Committee, then it is highly likely that the Soviet Union will withdraw from the UN. At the same time, according to authoritative sources, the US delegation is prepared to implement this new Marshall Plan immediately after two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly pass the proposal, regardless of the Soviet Union's participation. American newspapers warmly defend Marshall's new plan, unanimously demanding that the General Assembly pass the proposal quickly, regardless of the Soviet Union's threats. When considering the possibility of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the UN, the delegations of some small countries do not dare to express their views on this proposal before receiving instructions from their governments.

### In the Future, Battleships and Artillery Will Be Replaced by Rockets; Prediction in British Naval Yearbook

[Associated Press, London, 18th] The naval yearbook "Jane's Fighting Ships" 1946-1947 edition was published yesterday, in which it predicts that within the next one or two years, the position of the main weapon on the latest battleships, the 16-inch caliber artillery, will be replaced by rockets, and the United Kingdom is entering a new era of conversion to cope with atomic bombs. Construction of the US 45,000-ton battleship "Kentucky" and the 27,500-ton battlecruiser "Hawaii" was temporarily suspended, probably because it was planned to add rockets to the equipment.

### Indian Government Denies Discrimination Against Muslims

[Reuters, New Delhi, 19th] After Khan, the representative of Pakistan attending the UN General Assembly, stated that if the Indian government does not take steps to stop the killing of Muslims, Pakistan may appeal to the UN. The Indian government issued a statement today stating that it is prepared to have any impartial authority adjudicate Pakistan's accusations against India. The statement also denies Khan's claims that the Indian government is unable to fulfill its responsibilities, and states that the Indian government has never incited any ethnic group to use violence against violence. Mrs. Pandit, the Indian representative attending the General Assembly, also issued a statement to the press, stating that retaliation against discrimination is never the way to peace. The statement that India does not want Muslims in its territory is absolutely untrue. There are still 30 million Muslim residents in the Dominion of India, and the Indian government has no intention of relocating them. The Indian government's purpose in the immigration work is limited to the Punjab.

### Hata Shunroku on Trial

Prosecutors Amend Indictment

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] The Tokyo International Military Tribunal began the trial of Hata Shunroku on the 19th. The main points of his charges are: (1) He was the commander of the China Expeditionary Army and engaged in wars of aggression; (2) He planned and prepared for wars of aggression during his tenure; (3) He was one of the masterminds of the overthrow of the Yonai Cabinet. Hata's defender stated in his defense that Hata did not agree with the war of aggression and assisted Umeda Daisen in his defection. He also stated that Hata did not conspire to overthrow the Yonai Cabinet. The prosecutor in charge of this case unexpectedly deleted most of the indictment and only accepted part of it. Hata Shunroku is the most well-known Japanese war criminal to the Chinese people. His misdeeds and crimes during his time as commander of the China Expeditionary Army and his condoning of the brutality of the Japanese army are truly unforgivable.

### The Political Situation in Vietnam Turns Delicate: Political Turmoil Erupts Again in Cochinchina

[Reuters, Saigon, 18th] The Cochinchina Council in Saigon today passed a vote of no confidence against the country's President, Lê Văn Vỹ, further escalating the political turmoil. The Cochinchina Council's resolution also addresses the Governor of Vietnam, Borel, regarding this dispute. The Republic of Cochinchina has been established for eighteen months. Some parties within the country are inclined to maintain the status quo, while others view the Lê Văn Vỹ government as an untrustworthy puppet regime. Simultaneously, according to French sources, Annam's Emperor Bảo Đại's agreement to negotiate with France offers hope for an early resolution to the Vietnam War. While French officials point out that Bảo Đại's declaration refers to Vietnam's "independence," and the French propose "autonomy," a gap exists. It is believed this gap can be bridged. Paris hopes Bảo Đại will formally engage in negotiations with France. French authorities may issue another statement encouraging the Vietnamese to support Bảo Đại.

### Severe Flooding in Japan: Tokyo Residents Evacuate

Two Hundred Thousand Homeless

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] The Ministry of Social Welfare announced today that another 50,000 Japanese people have begun to evacuate the northern districts of Tokyo. Reconnaissance by the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division estimates approximately 200,000 Japanese are homeless on the Kantō Plain. Dikes have been eroded by the floodwaters and are showing signs of damage. Coupled with tidal surges, the city faces the threat of being inundated. Approximately 350 U.S. troops from the 11th Airborne Division in northern Honshu, stranded for four days and nights due to floodwaters while traveling by train, have returned to their base unharmed.

### U.S. Soldier Rapes Japanese Girl

The Command dispatched military police to arrest the perpetrator, who is currently being interrogated.

### Allied Officials: From Arrogant to Deferential

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] As the date for concluding a peace treaty with Japan approaches, the attitude of senior Allied officials toward Japanese government officials has become noticeably "milder." For the first year and a half after the occupation of Japan, relations between the Allied forces and Japanese government officials remained formal and constrained. This is gradually changing. The relationship between American and Japanese representatives has now evolved towards a more natural state, approaching a position of equality to some extent. This clear symbolic change can be seen in the demeanor of General MacArthur during his meetings with Emperor Hirohito in May of this year. According to sources with authority, in the first two meetings, MacArthur addressed the Emperor as "you," but in subsequent meetings, MacArthur consistently addressed Hirohito as "Your Majesty." The shift in the U.S. attitude towards Japan, from stern to moderate, began after the new constitution came into effect on May 3rd. A few days after the constitution was enacted, several senior Japanese government officials visited key personnel in the Allied Command. After the meeting, Allied officials, unusually, escorted them to the door, much to the surprise of the Japanese officials.

Intense fighting with Dutch-Indian forces occurred in heavy fog for ninety minutes, resulting in sixty Dutch soldiers killed and twenty wounded.

[Central News Agency, Flushing, 18th] It was announced here today that the United States will be the third member of the cessation committee handling the Indonesian issue in the Security Council. The governments of Australia and Belgium, attending the United Nations General Assembly, had jointly requested the United States government to serve as the third member of the mediation committee. With the United States' agreement, the mediation committee has been finalized as Australia, Belgium, and the United States.

[United Press, Sumatra, Padang, 19th] Representatives of the United Nations Consular Investigation Team from the UK, France, and Australia flew to Bukit Tinggi yesterday to conduct an on-the-ground investigation into the implementation of the ceasefire order by the Dutch and Indonesian sides. This marks the first visit to the area by European personnel since the outbreak of the Dutch-Indonesian conflict. The representatives originally planned to travel by jeep, but switched to a dedicated Dakota aircraft of the Australian Air Force due to road obstructions and landmines.

[Reuters, The Hague, 19th] The Dutch cabinet held a special meeting for two and a half hours yesterday, which included Governor-General Van Mook, who recently returned from the United States. The Dutch Cabinet has decided to issue a statement on Indonesian policy next Tuesday.

Employed workers and women caring for children under the age of fifteen are exempt from this rule.

### Soviet Union Sends Another Note to Iran: Urges Prompt Ratification of Oil Agreement Between the Two Countries

[Reuters, Tehran, 18th] Reliable sources state that the Soviet Union has sent a second note to Iran, sternly demanding that the Iranian parliament take swift action on the joint Soviet-Iranian oil exploitation matter and refrain from procrastination. The note was submitted to the Iranian government by the Soviet Ambassador to Iran, Sergey Kavtaradze, on September 15th, in response to Iran's reply to the Soviet Union's first note. The Iranian reply refused the Soviet demand for Iran to sign a new oil agreement with the Soviet Union without the approval of the Iranian parliament. The Iranian parliament currently has no intention of immediately passing a vote of confidence in the Qavam government. Without this vote of confidence, Qavam cannot request parliament to ratify the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement signed last year.

### Burma to Gain Independence Next Year: U.S. and Burma Agree to Exchange Ambassadors

[United Press, London, 18th] The British Minister of State for Burma Affairs, Arthur Henderson, stated today that Burma will become a "completely independent republic" in January 1948. The Burmese Constituent Assembly will complete its new constitution for the "Union of Burma." At that time, the British government will sign a treaty with the Burmese government and will introduce the "Burma Independence Act" when the British Parliament convenes on October 20th. It is hoped that the legislative process for the independence act can be completed before Christmas, so that Burma can celebrate its independence by next January.

Having recently visited Burma to conduct an inspection, the terms of the treaty have been agreed upon in principle. The British government has appointed the current British Minister to Egypt, Gilbert Laithwaite, as the British High Commissioner to Burma. Later, Laithwaite will serve as the first British Ambassador to Burma. The situation in Burma is different from that in India. There is no transitional period of dominion status. After the transfer of power and the passage of the independence act, Burma will become an "independent and sovereign state."

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The U.S. State Department announced that the United States and Burma have agreed to upgrade the diplomatic missions of both countries to ambassadorial rank. U Thant will be the first Burmese Ambassador to the United States, and it is generally expected that Edwin Stanton will be appointed as the first U.S. Ambassador to Burma.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The silver shops in the city, which have been closed for six months, have been authorized to reopen and resume selling gold ornaments following the passage of a resolution by the Municipal Council yesterday. The official reopening date will be decided after the Social Affairs Bureau convenes a meeting with the responsible parties of the silver shop guilds on the 22nd. The selling price of gold ornaments is stipulated to be based on the exchange rate set by the Central Bank, plus an additional 40% for operating expenses (including chemicals, fire, labor, mold depreciation, staff commissions, public levies, packaging, coloring, advertising, stationery, operating expenses, and interest), and a 20% legal profit margin, plus a separate labor cost per item. To protect the interests of ordinary citizens, the purchase price will be based on the approved price, with the members of the silver shop guilds providing subsidies, subject to the approval of the Social Affairs Bureau.

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, solemnly stated yesterday that although silver shops are allowed to reopen and resume selling gold ornaments, they must not take this opportunity to purchase gold bars or melt the gold ornaments they receive into gold bars. Guild members should supervise each other and provide joint guarantees. If any illegal activities are discovered, they should be immediately reported. Otherwise, there is no guarantee of their long-term operation.

### Continued Interrogation of Witnesses in the Case Against Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Officials

[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Procuratorate has been holding hearings for days to investigate the case of alleged corruption against senior UNRRA officials, including Li Zhuomin and five others. A large number of witnesses were questioned yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Prosecutor He took the stand, first summoning Zhu Rushan, General Manager of Yutong Flour Company, because the company had a flour milling contract with UNRRA. He then summoned Wu Zhiheng, Manager of Zhiheng Pharmaceutical Factory. Before the accusations against UNRRA were made, Wu had a housing dispute with Hou Aichang, Director of the Transportation Department of UNRRA. After UNRRA's corruption was exposed, someone suddenly reported to the District Procuratorate that Director Hou had accepted a bribe of a house, specifying that it was related to Wu. Therefore, Wu was summoned to the court for questioning. Responsible parties from Fufeng Flour Company, Xi Debing, Pan Qiwen, Sun Zhongde, and staff members from Fuxin Flour Company, Liu Shouqi and Qian Shouchun, were also questioned, but the hearings were postponed to a later date.

The news of Li Zhuomin's preliminary suspension from his position has attracted great attention from all parties. However, according to a spokesman for UNRRA, the organization had not yet received any orders from the government as of yesterday. Li did not go to work at the organization yesterday.

### Municipal Museum Hosts Exhibition of Artifacts from Past Dynasties

### Representatives of Hongmen Groups Express Their Regards to Situ Meitang

Situ Meitang, a prominent figure in the Hongmen community in the United States, recently publicly announced his abandonment of the idea of forming a political party and his departure from the China Hongmen Minzhi Party. Representatives from two major organizations, the Preparatory Committee of the China Hongmen Global Kinship Conference and the Hongxing Society, including Cheng Zhuang, Zheng Ziliang, Chen Peide, Wang Zhiben, Wang Tiemin, Jiang Hao, Long Qingquan, Yang Wendao, and Shi Zhenjiang, visited Situ yesterday to express their deep admiration for his past contributions to the revolution. The Hongmen has always prioritized the nation and has a glorious history in the revolutionary cause. They promote justice and retire after success, fulfilling their obligations without seeking power. This is the consistent spirit of the Hongmen. If the original Hongmen organization were reorganized into a political party, it would lose the aforementioned meaning. If a political party were formed by some Hongmen members and named after the Hongmen, it would be even more inappropriate. Now, by abandoning the idea of forming a political party, departing from the Hongmen Minzhi Party, and striving for the overall unity of the Hongmen, they expressed their sympathy and extended their regards. Situ expressed his deep gratitude for the aforementioned goodwill and hoped that his Hongmen colleagues at home and abroad would continue to follow the original path, unite as one, and promote the early completion of the work of building a new China.

### Enthusiastic Response to Volunteer Soldier Recruitment: Expect to Meet Quota by the End of the Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the recruitment of volunteer soldiers began on the 15th, as of last night, a total of 761 people from various districts have reported to the new soldier recruitment center.

### Contribute Money and Labor

The Publicity Committee of the Military Service Association held a reception for the press at the Municipal Council at 3:00 PM yesterday to report on the recruitment of volunteer soldiers. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and Gao Baoshu, Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Garrison Command, also attended. Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Association, stated that since the recruitment of volunteer soldiers began, only a few days ago, the average number of people reporting from each district has been around 120 each day. Many did not meet the requirements but insisted on enlisting, and many donated their resettlement allowances to education, which was deeply moving. The enthusiasm of the people in each district in sending off volunteer soldiers was particularly evident. The city needs to recruit 3,000 people, and it is believed that the quota will be met by the end of the month. If the quota is not met, it will be collected by lottery according to law. During this period of total mobilization, all patriotic people should "contribute money and labor" and enthusiastically join the army or enlist. Central Committee Member Soong Tzu-wen donated all of his shares in the investment business of the China Construction Bank. It is said that Kong Lingkan, son of Kong Xiangxi, and other shareholders will soon take similar action, which can serve as a model. This is truly an excellent phenomenon.

### Oil Purchase Problem Remains Unresolved: China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) May Be Forced to Suspend Flights: Company Business Meeting to Discuss Proposals Starting Today

In order to actively improve its business, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is convening a business meeting in Shanghai from the 19th to the 21st, bringing together all senior officials of the company and the heads of eleven major offices in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Qingdao, Pan, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Calcutta. The 19th will be devoted to work reports from the heads of various departments and offices, and the discussion of business proposals will begin on the 20th.

According to CNAC General Manager Liu Jingyi's statement to reporters, the most difficult problem for CNAC to solve at present is the gasoline problem. CNAC's gasoline is supplied by British and American oil companies in Shanghai, so it must be purchased with U.S. dollars. The government has only given CNAC an official exchange rate of 500,000 U.S. dollars. Although the Executive Yuan approved this 500,000 U.S. dollars to be used for paying foreign employee salaries and purchasing aircraft parts, the Import Management Committee was supposed to allocate additional U.S. dollars at the official rate. However, the Import Management Committee has not yet provided a concrete response. CNAC is facing a major crisis with its oil supply due to the shortage of U.S. dollars and the prohibition of purchasing U.S. dollars on the black market. If a solution is not found in the next few days, CNAC may have to temporarily suspend flights starting on the 25th of this month. Liu added that even if U.S. dollars were obtained on the black market, the company would not be able to sustain itself due to its expenses exceeding its income. Otherwise, it would have to raise prices. However, an increase in airfreight rates would affect overall prices. In today's unstable financial situation, CNAC does not want to stimulate prices by raising airfreight rates. CNAC is continuing to negotiate with the responsible authorities, hoping to resolve this major issue as soon as possible.

### Bai Lu Buried in Hongqiao Cemetery Amid Gloomy Twilight and the Low Playing of a Funeral Dirge

[Report from Our Newspaper] The famous film actress Bai Lu, who previously died after falling down the stairs at the International Hotel, was buried yesterday afternoon in Hongqiao Cemetery. Before the burial, Bai Lu's relatives and friends held a public memorial service at the China Funeral Home. Tian Han presided over the service, and Hong Shen, Xiong Foxi, Luo Mingyou, Xia Yunhu, Bai Yang, and Wang Renmei were among those who attended. During the memorial service, Feng Zi gave a detailed report on Bai Lu's life. Tian Han and Hong Shen also delivered eulogies. Afterwards, Jin Yan, Liu Huan, Shi Dongshan, Shen Fu, Feng Zi, Pan Zichen, and others helped to move the coffin to Hongqiao Cemetery, where it was covered with earth amid the gloomy twilight and the low playing of a funeral dirge. This young artist has thus bid farewell to the world forever.

Bai Lu's two children, Anmei and Xiaomei, had originally planned to come to Shanghai from Hong Kong to see her one last time, but they had not arrived as of yesterday. Bai Lu's husband, Mr. Jiang, stood precariously in front of the grave for a long time, unwilling to leave. A few bouquets of flowers and a mound of yellow earth were enough to cause him endless grief.

### Drastic Increase in Land Tax Conversion Rate by More Than Tenfold; Director of Land Bureau Pleads for Farmers, Principle Accepted by Central Government

[Our Newspaper Report] Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, went to Beijing by night train on the 16th to request the central government to reduce this year's land tax rate and returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties yesterday. It is reported that the central government has, in principle, accepted the request. The collection of this year's land tax still awaits the official document from the Ministry of Food. According to the central government's regulations, the standard for this year's land tax collection is 3.45 dou per mu (including 1.5 dou for price conversion, 1.5 dou for actual grain, and 0.45 dou for public grain). This is a considerable increase compared to last year's 1.96 dou per mu. Furthermore, as this city is not a production area, it is impossible to collect actual grain. According to central government regulations, the average grain price of the three months before the tax collection should be used as the standard for converting to national currency. If calculated according to this standard, this year's land tax conversion price in this city will increase by about 13 to 15 times compared to last year. Farmers will definitely be unable to bear this burden. Therefore, Director Tian personally went to Beijing to plead for the farmers of this city. After contacting Zhang Daomin, Director of the Land Tax Department of the Ministry of Food, agreement was reached in principle, but it still needs to be submitted to the Ministry of Food for a final decision.

### Abandoned Monstrous Fetus; Eye Growing on Forehead

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday afternoon, residents near the Central Clinic at 1420 Kangding Road, Caojiadu, West District, reported that a monstrous fetus had been abandoned on the side of Kangding Road, its limbs twitching and emitting faint cries. The clinic sent a doctor to retrieve the fetus. Upon detailed examination, it was discovered that the infant had an eye growing on its forehead, was in a semi-sleep state, and had two fleshy horns protruding from the top of its head. The physique resembled that of a boy, with a vaguely visible genital area. It was still breathing last night and was fed liquid food, but due to concerns about the digestive system and the intestinal tract not being open, its life is unlikely to be prolonged.

### Clues to Gold Bars, Involving Unnamed Young Girl; Bar Girl Saw Photos at Malai's Place

[Our Newspaper Report] The District Court continued the trial of the case of British citizen Ke Li Aque, accused of shooting Yu Shengxiao, at 9:00 AM yesterday. After Judge Zhu Yuying and Prosecutor Ding Tongjun took their seats, the first witness called was Paichuluofu, the owner of the car rental company. He testified that he had a car for rent and had known Ke Li for two years. Ke Li often rented cars, and usually had a driver with him, for a period of one to three hours. August 1st was the longest time he used the car. Ke Li came to rent the car that afternoon, saying that he was going out with his girlfriend and did not need a driver. At that time, they agreed on 80,000 yuan per time. When returning the car, he gave me a check for 800,000 yuan, along with the key, and told me to cash the excess amount and return it to him the next day. At this time, I saw that there was another person behind Ke Li, who was shorter in stature, not wearing a hat, wearing a white shirt, with a suit jacket draped over his shoulders, made of gabardine, which seemed to be summer clothing. The two of them walked into the Huizhong Hotel. Later, Ke Li ordered me to drive this person to the Broadway Mansion, and then take Ke Li home. The two of them spoke softly in the car, and the content was unclear. After the car stopped at the Broadway Mansion, I opened the door for him. I paid a little attention and it seemed that this person was flustered. When getting out of the car, I only heard "See you tomorrow." Then I drove Ke Li home.

Car Owner's Testimony Differs from Ke Li's

At this point, the court, noting the contradiction between his testimony and Ke Li's testimony the previous day, turned to Ke Li and questioned him: "Did you go alone when you returned the car?" Ke Li first said: "I went alone." Then he said: "Malai drove." He also testified: "The car fare was paid in advance with a check for 800,000 yuan. I did not want a driver at that time, and I did not say that I was going out with my girlfriend." Then Ke Li's wife, Natalia, was summoned and testified, "We have been married for three years. Because I have been deeply traumatized, I am mentally unstable and do not want to answer questions. I submitted a written report to the court previously, please use that as a basis." The court ordered the translator to translate her previous testimony into Russian and showed her the transcript from the US military court, which she nodded in agreement to. Afterwards, Fulinjing Yena Luoweifu, the owner of the New Luminous Pearl Wine Shop, testified that he was an American, 50 years old. Malai often came to the wine shop. On the morning of August 1st, at about 10:00 AM, Malai and Ke Li came together, and Malai introduced Ke Li to me. Malai came again at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, while Ke Li waited outside.

Planning to Exchange Gold Bars for US Dollars

Next, Hu  Wen, the wife of Yunlunhang staff member Zengnian, testified that at around 6:00 PM on the first day of the month, Ke Li and another person came to our house to find Xie, saying that they had a gold bar and wanted to exchange it for US dollars. At that time, I replied that I did not do this kind of business and introduced them to Chengdu Car Company to inquire. Then Hu Genhui, the owner of my sewing shop, was questioned and testified that Yu Shengxiao was in the store that day to avoid the rain, and mentioned the gold bar transaction, saying that if this business was successful, he could earn 2 million yuan. The questioning ended at 11:15 AM. The court adjourned. The questioning continued from 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Wang Zirong, the accountant of Chengdu Car Company, testified that Ke Li had come to visit with Xie's business card. Wu Zhongying, the manager of Chengdu Car Company, said that he was out at the time and did not know the situation. Le Shi, the wife of the victim Yu Shengxiao, said: On August 1st, Yu told me that an American official with great power wanted to buy gold bars. After going out at 9:30 AM, he was never seen again.

Malai Preparing to Marry, Needs One Thousand US Dollars

Finally, Gao Meiying, the cigarette girl at the Boxuelong Bar, testified that at about 10:00 AM on August 1st, Malai came to the Boxuelong Wine Shop to drink. Later, he led me to the Broadway Mansion and showed me two photos of young girls, saying that he was preparing to get married but needed 1,000 US dollars and did not have the money. I told him to drink less wine and save some money. Malai shrugged his shoulders at this and said nothing. The next morning, at 9:00 AM, he drove me home. At 8:00 PM in the evening, he came to the Xuebolong to drink again and gave me 20 US dollars. Not long after, Malai went out. At about 10:00 PM, he came again, and the two young girls in the photo also came. When Ke Li was questioned, he said he did not know Gao Meiying, but Malai had told me that a friend could exchange US dollars for him, probably referring to the cigarette girl at the Xuebolong Wine Shop. At this point, the defense lawyer Tang Huai requested the court to try to summon the two young girls in the photo to the court for questioning next time, which might lead to the discovery of the whereabouts of the gold bars. The questioning ended at about 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The court decided that the case would be heard again in ten days. The court also requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask the US military to arrange for the American suspect Malai to appear in court at the next hearing to testify.

### Challenging the Great Tide! Emergency Repair of Collapsing Embankment in Nansha

[Our Newspaper Report from Hangzhou, 17th] The Qiantang River has the world-famous tidal bore, and people from all over the world go to Haining every year to see the "Qiantang River Tide," which is truly a sea of people. Now that the "Ghost Tide" of the seventh month has passed, the "Osmanthus Tide" of the eighth month is about to come like an avalanche; travel agencies and tourists are already preparing to see this annual spectacle. However, the weather is not cooperating, the tide has changed direction, the tidal bore at Haining has caused sand and soil to accumulate, and the water flow of the Qiantang River is concentrated on the south bank. The first to bear the brunt is Nansha in Xiaoshan County. However, the residents of Nansha are in no mood to watch this roaring tidal bore because the tide is more ferocious than the Japanese during the occupation. It will devour their lives, property, and land in an instant. The tidal water of the Qiantang River moves underground. With enormous force, it rushes into the strata from the riverbank, hollows out the soil, and with a booming sound, dozens of acres of farmland suddenly collapse and are scattered in the surging tidal bore, leaving no time to escape. Therefore, it has become very common for farmers in Nansha to dismantle their houses and move, just like refugees fleeing during wartime, but their feelings are even more miserable than those of wartime refugees. Their situation is exactly the opposite of that of their ancestors who immigrated to Nansha more than a hundred years ago. Their ancestors went to the New World with joy and hope, like the Europeans who went to America in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; but they are being driven back by the sea with dejection and despair, so many men who have never shed tears before are now weeping bitterly by the river.

River Water Erodes Toupeng Town

The change in the flow of the Qiantang River began in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, but at that time, the sand accumulation on the north bank and the embankment collapse on the south bank were gradual and not very obvious. In Nansha, at first, it swept away the sandy beaches that no one cared about and collapsed the uncultivable land, gradually eroding the farmland. At that time, the overall situation was unstable, and no one paid attention. By the time of victory, it had already swallowed up farmland that extended seven or eight li inland. It was not until after the spring tide this year that the embankment collapse became more severe, and the river water had eroded the first large town near the river, Toupeng, putting the residents in imminent danger. The local area was in a state of panic and commotion. Petitions and appeals for relief resounded through the town, but the Dyke Construction Bureau said that its responsibility was to protect the dike and was fully repairing the dikes that had collapsed in Haining on the north bank last year. Nansha was 20 to 30 li outside the dike on the south bank, so it could not be taken care of. The local authorities were asked to repair it themselves. The Dyke Construction Bureau could only send technical personnel to assist. After repeated requests, 400 tons of flour were allocated. However, the local area promised to raise 500 to 600 million yuan in construction funds, but they never managed to raise the money, so the emergency repair work was equivalent to doing nothing. Toupeng Town also suffered, and a large number of houses were swallowed by the sea. As a result, the Nansha problem became more serious. In mid-July, Chairman Shen rushed to inspect the disaster area and decided that the engineering office would be reorganized and taken over by the Dyke Construction Bureau. In name, it was still jointly run with the local government, but the Dyke Construction Bureau would advance the funds for emergency repairs first. On August 1st, the new engineering office was established, and the Dyke Construction Bureau specially sent Commissioner Dong to supervise the emergency repairs. Under the difficult conditions of tight funding, lack of transportation, and shortage of materials, Commissioner Dong made every effort to repair the embankment. Initially, it was planned to build three T-shaped embankments at the head and tail of the riverbank of Toupeng Town and the riverbank east of Toupeng, according to the most effective method of building embankments. However, the experiment failed because the tide was too ferocious and the riverbank was still collapsing, and the embankments became small islands separated from the land. Therefore, the most basic method had to be used, directly using stones to protect the embankment. However, due to the lack of funds and stone, the project could only build 40 meters in the most dangerous area. Therefore, embankment collapse would still occur in areas without engineering, but the embankment collapse in Toupeng had improved day by day, and the residents celebrated and no longer dismantled their houses and moved.

Raging Waves Hitting the Shore, Giant Stones Flying

On the third day of the lunar seventh month, the tide was unprecedentedly turbulent. The raging waves hit the shore, and the white waves soared into the sky, reaching a height of four or five zhang! The giant stones that were submerged in the water to protect the embankment, which required five or six people to move, were washed ashore by the tide and reached a distance of more than a hundred feet! Some of the giant stones were carried to the center of the river, and some were carried upstream. Only about 10% to 20% remained. When the residents saw that the giant stones could fly, they knew that the situation was beyond saving, so they rushed to dismantle their houses and move again. However, the engineering office still had to fight the water with all its might. They had spent more than 100 million yuan to buy wood, preparing to make wooden  and sink stones into the water to lay the foundation, and then make bamboo cages to hold stones to protect the embankment. The cages and  are connected with lead wire to prevent them from being washed ashore or carried away. The only remaining problem is how to deal with the "underground activity" of the tide. Commissioner Dong said, "The tide that is concentrated on Nansha now is the same as the tide that rushed to Haining one hundred and fifty or sixty years ago. At that time, Emperor Qianlong used a large amount of the national treasury and built a solid fish-scale dike and stone dike, plus a water diversion channel, to protect Haining. Now Nansha has no defenses, and the entire funding is only enough to build one zhang of stone dike, so it is like a large knife team resisting a modern mechanized force, how can it be resisted? Toupeng has collapsed by a quarter, becoming a peninsula, and the turbulent tide still has one month left, its fate is determined here! Our project can only be said to have done our best."

### Shen Kai Case Re-Investigated Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Report from Suzhou, 19th] The Wu District Procuratorate re-interrogated Shen Kai, the former Chief of General Affairs of the Suzhou Rent Collection Office, yesterday on suspicion of corruption and embezzlement. Summons were also issued to the directors of various branch offices. As a result of the serious charges, Shen Kai was returned to custody. The directors of various branch offices were each granted bail upon the submission of written guarantees worth three thousand yuan from three shops.

### Ministry of National Defense Collects Traitor Data

[Our Newspaper Report from Suzhou, 19th] In order to  report on the organizations of traitors and the overview of punishment, the Historical and Political Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense  collected information from the Ministry of Justice. After the Ministry issued orders to various provinces, the Jiangsu Provincial High Court has sent the files of major traitors such as Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, and Chen Biguin to Beijing.

### The Qiantang River Flow Tends Towards the Central Channel; Saving the Overall Situation Instead of Just Nansha

The Nansha project is currently the most dangerous and difficult. The dike construction bureau is not doing its best to save Nansha even though the north bank has sand accumulation and the dike can be ensured to be safe. Many people are criticizing it this way, but the Dyke Construction Bureau is thinking from the overall situation and has a completely different view. Deputy Director Wang Huzhen said, "The change in the direction of water flow is a good phenomenon for the Qiantang River itself. The river flow tends to the central channel, scouring the riverbed, deepening the waterway, which is extremely beneficial to the navigation of the Qiantang River and is in line with the ideal river management plan of the Dyke Construction Bureau. The outflow of water divided into two routes, north and south, due to the influence of the sand accumulation from Jianshan to Mamuxiang during the war, can also be combined into one. The area along the river from Jianshan to the Zhutoujiao of Wengjiabu is covered with sand accumulation, covering an area of 200,000 mu, which is connected to the riverbank, so the dike is safe. Although Nansha is collapsing, it will probably stop slightly at the line of Shushan and Xinwandai. It is of less importance than ensuring the safety of Hang, Jia, Hu, Song, Su, Chang, and Tai. Before the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were three outlets in Qiantang River, one for the current road, one for the small and middle doors between Shushan and Zhesan, and one for the Nanshan Gate between Zhesan and  Mountain. At the current trend, gradually returning to the ancient road, the hidden danger of the seven counties experiencing major floods since the Ming and Qing dynasties can be eliminated."

From the perspective of natural trends and economic conditions, it is beyond our power to protect Nansha, and it is also unnecessary. Instead of spending manpower and resources on rescue efforts that are of no help to the overall situation, it is better to use the construction funds to provide relief to the victims. Toupeng Town is located along the river for more than 1,000 meters, but the project is only more than 4,000 meters. The tidal bore on the third day of the lunar seventh month was not very effective, let alone the turbulent "Osmanthus Tide" that is coming. Nansha is collapsing, Toupeng has become a peninsula, and the engineering office is still trying to fight the water with all its might, but what awaits them may be a dark fate. (Xing Tian)

### Su Province Handles Military Grain; Simultaneously Advancing Procurement and Borrowing

[Our Newspaper Report from Zhenjiang, 18th] This province is ordered to prepare military grain for October and November of this year, divided into two types: borrowing and procurement. Regarding the borrowing part, Chairman Wang has ordered the Provincial Grain Office to properly draft a borrowing plan, according to the grain production situation of each county, to determine the amount of allocation, the grain borrowed will be allowed to offset the land tax for this year, or be returned in the collection of grain tax for this year as soon as possible, and deduct the interest of two liters of rice per stone of grain first.

### Anhui Western Refugees Gather in Bengbu; Curfew Advanced One Hour

[Our Newspaper Report from Bengbu, 17th] About 2,000 refugees from western and central Anhui who were detained escaped hastily, with few belongings. All hotels here are full, and it is very difficult to find a place to stay, so they mostly live in public places or sleep in the countryside, which is very sad. The Bengbu fellow villagers associations of various counties have organized a refugee relief association to appeal to all parties for relief. For the sake of stepping up prevention, the city defense department advanced the curfew by one hour from the 15th, starting at 11:00 PM every night, martial law began, and lifted at 5:30 AM the next morning.

### Zhejiang Autumn Cocoon Harvest Only Reaches 70%

[This newspaper's Hangzhou nineteenth dispatch] This year's hot weather has greatly affected the Zhejiang autumn cocoon harvest, with only 70% harvested.

### Shanghai County Magistrate Yu Talks About the Water Monster

[This newspaper's Minhang sixteenth dispatch] Recently, rumors of a water monster in the Huangpu River have been rife, causing widespread anxiety. Shanghai County Magistrate Yu specifically made a statement to reporters, saying: "The so-called water monster is actually a purposeful rumor. Residents should remain calm. If you don't find it strange, the strange thing will disappear by itself."

### Between Shanghai and Taiwan

[This newspaper's nineteenth dispatch] Thirty hours by sea or three and a half hours by air, has made the distance between Taiwan and inland Shanghai shorter and shorter. Normal transportation on the Shanghai-Taiwan line helps the overall integration and intersection of inland and island culture and life. But even though the distance is shortening, time doesn't seem to help get rid of multiple barriers.

Taiwan Dollar Incites Division

The only special thing about Taiwan is the Taiwan dollar. The Taiwan dollar is actually used to stabilize prices in the province and build a breakwater for the island. But at the moment, this breakwater has been cracked by the surging waves inside and outside. Industrial products on the island cannot be exported steadily, while supplementary raw materials and machinery are still urgently needed. In the past, it relied on the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's 20 billion legal currency to make the foreign exchange conversion, but whether Taiwan Sugar is willing to convert it at the official price of 72 yuan to the Taiwan dollar has become a problem. Therefore, the provincial government has repeatedly sought a normal way for exchange but failed. The black market price of Taiwan dollars in the Taipei market has fallen to as low as 52.

Prices Exceed Shanghai

This situation has hurt the gold diggers who went from the Nanjing-Shanghai line, but on the contrary, it has encouraged the peddlers. They can remit one million legal currency with a ship ticket, which is more than enough to pay for the travel expenses. This kind of money-making travel has made Shanghainese see Taiwanese local products, and has also made Taiwanese compatriots see the index of rising prices.

Saying that prices in Taiwan are low, either is wrong or it is something in the past. People who go from Shanghai to Taiwan or from Taiwan to Shanghai will feel that prices on the island are high. When converted with the Taiwan dollar, it exceeds Shanghai. It is not easy to earn a lot of money in Taiwan, and commercially speaking, there is no big appetite, but it is not difficult to consume. The provincial government's institutions for controlling and regulating supplies are still busy receiving because of personnel transactions; many people are saving infinite heat.

Maintaining Traditional Life

Those who have been in Taiwan for a long time are unwilling to stay there any longer, but there are many people in Shanghai who are attacking Taiwan. The island has its advantages, but it also has its shortcomings. The government that "digs for gold" is not welcome, and the people are not happy either. Taiwanese people need to maintain and continue a simple, honest, earnest, and hardworking life tradition, but unfortunately it is being destroyed and diluted day by day.

Outside of the New Soldier Base

Militarily, Taiwan can be used as a base for training new soldiers, and it seems more suitable as an island park. The existing construction adds modern beauty to the monotonous scenery, and the favorable weather and geographical location give the island another view. Here, a two-week tour can obtain great fun.

There are several types of people who can be praised, such as technical workers who work hard in the field, academic researchers, and honest and dedicated administrative staff... They seek comfort in work and career in narrow, monotonous, and lonely situations. This is the vitality that stability gives them. (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)

### The Education Bureau Orders That Newly Hired Teachers and Staff of Municipal Elementary Schools Be Submitted for Review by a Deadline

[This newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau recently instructed all national schools in the city that the periods for submitting newly hired teachers and staff of the municipal national schools for review varied, and the various forms to be submitted were also not uniform. Special notes on submitting teachers and staff for review have been formulated, stipulating that the submission matters should be completed within 20 days after the start of each semester. Because the method was promulgated later this semester, it is specially postponed for half a month, extending to before October 5. The following are the details of the notes: (1) The submission of newly hired teachers for review by each school should be completed within 20 days after the start of each semester. (2) Teachers hired by each school must be registered and qualified by the bureau before they can be submitted for review. (3) When submitting for review, the "School-wide Proposed Teacher Application Form" and the "Salary Grade Review Record Form" of the personnel to be reviewed should be filled out, and a photo of the person should be attached and stamped with the school seal. (4) The name filled in should be consistent with the name on the registration or qualification certificate. If there are any inconsistencies in other qualification documents, a valid certificate from the person's native county government or other qualification certificate should be submitted. (5) When submitting for review, the registration certificate or qualification certificate and various qualification documents should be submitted together, bound into a book in order, and a cover directory should be added. (6) The service record column of the review form should be filled in chronological order and should not be filled in reverse order. (7) If service documents (such as appointment orders, etc.) do not have start and end dates or do not indicate the stage, the payment period will be used for calculation. (8) If teachers and staff fail to submit for review on time, they will be paid at the lowest grade before they are submitted for review, and they will not be allowed to request additional payments. (9) According to Article 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Government's Provisional Measures for Employees to Apply for Salary Revision, a solid certificate and reason should be submitted within one month of the arrival of the approved document, and the application for revision should be limited to one time.

### A Primary School Teacher's Confession Reveals the Dark Side of Japanese Education

School Education Still Advances on the Road of Militarism

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo twelfth airmail] The Asahi Shimbun's "Voice of the Readers" column here published a letter from Ermu Xingping, a primary school teacher in Miyagi Prefecture, entitled "Democratization of the Education Sector?" The letter stated: "The teacher qualification review has been held since last year, but it has always been just a formality. Among the 9,000 teachers in Miyagi Prefecture, only 10 have failed the review. The wartime school administration posture is still preserved. The Ministry of Education officials do not criticize or review it in any way, and school education still follows the road of militarism. People who were local inspectors in the Ministry of Education during the war, although some of them continued to work after the war, most of them transferred to various counties to serve as principals. We firmly oppose this kind of formal democratization. Furthermore, in terms of personnel administration, we have never valued those who come from exams. Even with decades of teaching experience and excellent teaching skills, it is difficult to be promoted to principal. The personnel changes in March of this year caused anger among general teachers. Now, if this kind of injustice and discrimination are not broken, there is no hope of realizing the democratization of education forever." From this paragraph in the letter, it can be explained not only that Japanese education administration has not been democratized at all, but also that the democratization situation of other general politics and economy can be inferred from this. This confession of a primary school teacher is by no means a meaningless complaint. At a time when the Allied countries are discussing the peace treaty with Japan, this fact should be paid attention to.

The three-day agenda includes the opening ceremony on the morning of the 20th, followed by group reviews of proposals in the afternoon. On the morning of the 21st, each district will present a report, followed by a conference in the afternoon to discuss the proposals reviewed by each group.

Important Issues

The important issues for this conference are to discuss the overall plan for the production, construction, and development of the textile industry. Among the important proposals, Shi Fengxiang proposed a ten-year plan for the development of the national textile industry. The proposals from the District 6 Association include: (1) A proposal that member factories that directly spin finished products from their own spun cotton yarn should not be subject to business tax in accordance with the law. (2) A proposal that the stamp tax on warehouse receipts should be applied at the rate for deposit documents, with each item (i.e., each sheet) stamped with 500 yuan. (3) A proposal that the standard for fixed asset appreciation be stipulated and depreciation methods be established to achieve uniformity, as the fixed asset appreciation of member factories varies widely. (4) A proposal that the electricity supply in the Shanghai city area is often cut off, causing heavy losses to cotton mills. Measures should be taken to expand power generation equipment and restrict unnecessary consumption to benefit production. (5) A proposal to request all yarn factories across the country to restore the twelve-hour workday to increase production and reduce costs. (6) A proposal to determine how to handle foreign-owned yarn factories and Chinese-operated yarn factories within the jurisdiction of each district that have delayed joining the association. In addition, Districts 1, 6, 7, and 8 proposed three items for seeking remedies regarding the issue of opening trade with Japan, urging the government to pay close attention to the matter.

When the association reviews the proposals, it will be divided into five groups: association affairs, raw materials, production, sales and transportation, and economic administration, for separate review. The association held its first general meeting in Chongqing in 1945.

The Central Trust Bureau, in view of the fact that the restoration of free trading in the edible oil market has not achieved the expected stability in prices, plans to entrust oil mills to purchase and produce oil by proxy, increasing production by 30,000 dan per month, and is actively promoting this plan to achieve it as soon as possible.

It is learned that the various oil mills are interested in this method. The Third Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association has drafted the method, which is similar to the previous method by which the Central Trust Bureau entrusted manufacturers to purchase rapeseed by proxy. However, of the 30,000 dan of finished products, soybean oil will account for half, and the rest will depend on the quantity of rapeseed and sesame raw materials. The main targets for the purchase locations for rapeseed will still be Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuhu, while soybeans will be expanded to Kaifeng, Hankou, Xuzhou, and Bengbu.

According to the ratio of raw materials to production, soybeans can produce an average of 9 jin of oil per dan. If 15,000 dan of oil are produced, approximately 170,000 dan of raw materials will be required. Each dan of rapeseed produces 30 jin of oil, and sesame produces 40 jin. If the two are mixed to produce the above quantity of oil, approximately 50,000 dan of raw materials will be required. According to the market price on the 19th, soybeans cost 240,000 yuan per dan.

### China Tanker Company Invites All Sectors to Visit

China Tanker Co., Ltd. is the first oil transportation institution in China. It has four Class A tankers with a deadweight of over 10,000 tons and eighteen Class B tankers with a deadweight of 1,200 tons. Since its organization and establishment in February of this year and the start of navigation, it has been more than half a year, and its business development has been extremely rapid. It is heard that the company, with its Class A tanker Yonghong about to set sail for the ocean, has specially scheduled tomorrow (the 21st) from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the Yonghong tanker at the China Merchants Bureau's Outer Hongqiao Second Wharf to invite people from all walks of life to come and visit. Chairman Weng Wenhao will personally host the event and will provide visitors with an oil tanker brochure, which describes the company's overview, the structure and equipment of the oil tanker, and the history of the development of oil tankers in the world in great detail.

### Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices Remain Unchanged - Market Price of Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise Yesterday

[This Newspaper] The negotiated price of cotton yarn at the Textile Association did not change yesterday, with 20-count yarn still maintaining the original price of 11.8 million yuan. The prices of other counts of yarn are determined by the Textile Construction Company in proportion and with reference to market conditions.

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions saw the market turn from stable to firm. In the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose to as high as 19.3 million yuan, a further increase of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

The cotton cloth market opened slightly firm, but the market sentiment softened due to the arrival of inspectors on the scene for spot checks. Throughout the day, Jingyuan fine cloth and dark-colored White Cat floral cloth sold well, and the market was firm. Longtou fine cloth ended up rising by 12,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

China Textile's Allocation Price for Yarn is Too High

According to investigations by the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, the recent price fluctuations in the yarn market are mainly due to the fact that the allocation price of yarn by the China Textile Company has increased along with the black market price, and there have been cases where the black market price has fallen but the allocation price has not, resulting in prices exceeding the black market price. This has made it difficult to carry out price equalization work. It is hoped that the company will pay attention to this.

The China Textile Construction Company followed its usual practice of selling yarn in two groups, A and B, yesterday. Group A sold 694 pieces of yarn, with 268 applications. Group B sold 1,215 pieces of yarn, with 965 applications.

Seven People Detained for Entering Without a Permit

The Yarn and Cloth Group of the Economic Investigation Brigade of the Police Bureau continued to send personnel to monitor the cotton cloth market yesterday. They arrested Xu Yaozhang, Bao Zipei, Zhang Chengzhao, Wang Xishan, Chi Zhishan, Ren Songmao, Chen Xueyi and other seven people for entering the market without a permit and detained them for three days as a warning. They also found 79 expired entry permits, and the police bureau has ordered the person in charge of the cotton cloth industry association to complete the entry permit procedures before the 26th and has given them a warning.

### Cotton Market Quiet

Cotton transactions were quiet yesterday. Cotton mills are watching cautiously due to tight money and weak yarn prices. Some traders have tight money, some have loose money, and not many transactions were made. Most of the deals that were made were on credit. Due to interest rate relations, prices were clearly stable but secretly declining. Stalls sold a total of 740 bales.

### Unified Bonds Mediocre, Foreign Stocks In Consolidation

Public bonds fell slightly yesterday, but the situation was still mediocre. Unified C opened at 12,400 yuan. Lots 360, 555 were sold, and the market fell to 11,600 yuan. Lots 503, 550 were slightly accepted and rose slightly to close at 12,000 yuan. As a result, Unified A and B fell by 200 yuan compared to the previous close, Unified C fell by 500 yuan, Unified D fell slightly by 100 yuan, and Unified E fell by 400 yuan. The transaction volume was still only 5 million.

Foreign stocks fluctuated uncertainly yesterday, with the process being weak at the beginning and gradually stabilizing later. Ewo Silk opened at 92,800 yuan and immediately rose. In the afternoon, it rose slightly to 94,700 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Although the Guangdong gang and foreign firms were accepting, securities firms and retail investors were selling, and the transaction volume was still small. It was even rarer in the afternoon. As a result, British Union, Wheelock Marden, Guangdong Shipping, Steel Industry, and Telephone fell slightly compared to the previous close, Ewo fell by half a percent, and Ewo Silk Paper was still flat.

### Rayon Soars

The rayon market soared yesterday. 120 Golden Three Horse, Gaoshan, and others opened at 25.3 million yuan, and there was a strong demand from all parties. By noon, it had risen to 27 million yuan. The upward trend intensified in the afternoon, with new highs emerging one after another, but the buying enthusiasm did not diminish, and finally created a new record price of 29 million yuan. Dongyang was 29.5 million yuan, an increase of 3.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. This was due to the exhaustion of inventory and frequent sales. Although the Central Trust Bureau sells allocations on schedule, it still cannot meet the amount of consumption, which has caused the market to rise day by day.

Raw Silk

The market also rose sharply yesterday. Bids for all grades were 1.5 million yuan to 2 million yuan higher than the previous day. D-grade and E-grade grades were especially sought after. With current inventory drying up day by day, the market is even more popular. Yesterday, BC grades were bid at 40 million yuan, D-grade at 29.5 million yuan, and medium grades were bid at several levels from 26.5 million yuan to 28 million yuan. Gan Jing opened with a general bid of 26 million yuan, and 28 points and 5 dans were around 28 million yuan.

### Developing Nanyang Trade - There Should Be a Sense of Urgency and Priority

[This Newspaper] According to the analysis of economic expert Gao Shiheng, Nanyang is an agricultural society, and industrial products all rely on imports from foreign countries. The main categories are cotton yarn, cloth, cotton textiles, machinery, hardware and electrical appliances, and food. In 1938, the total imports of various states reached more than 330 million US dollars. Before the war, China's trade with Nanyang was mostly with Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. China imported more rice from Vietnam, and a large amount of oil was imported from Borneo and Jambi, so the trade volume with the Dutch East Indies increased significantly. The goods that China exports to Nanyang can be divided into two major categories: light industrial products and native products. The former is dominated by yarn and cloth and cotton textiles. China also has a place in hardware and daily necessities, such as light bulbs, electric fans, glassware and stationery. Chemicals and miscellaneous grains also have sales. In terms of export and trade figures, 1940 was a great improvement compared to 1938, but it was unfortunately interrupted by the outbreak of the Pacific War. In the future, China's trade with Nanyang should be arranged with a sense of urgency and priority. From a global perspective, China should strive to win the Dutch East Indies market with all its strength, because the area has the largest population and the strongest capacity. If we can capture the market in this area, half of the problem will be solved. The second is Malaya. The rubber and tin produced there can still maintain the world market, and Singapore is its hub. After Siam clears its debts, it will restore economic freedom, and trade is also promising. The prospects for Vietnam and Myanmar to trade with me are still difficult to predict.

### Public Sentiment Remains Indifferent - China Stocks Still Have Not Improved

The off-market terror of China stocks continued to exist yesterday, and more and more people were delivering goods, and another wave of declines reappeared in the middle of the session. However, after the sharp decline, the shorts accepted, and the situation gradually stabilized. Hot stocks rose and fell slightly, while miscellaneous stocks were slightly inferior, and Cement New Asia closed down.

Morning

The public sentiment was still stabilizing. When the market opened, the increases and decreases were slight. After Yongsha opened, Hengshu and Qianduiye continued to sell. Starting from 222 yuan for immediate delivery and 230 yuan for deferred delivery, they gradually gained lower. However, deferred Yongsha struggled within 220 yuan, and eventually, because the lingering fear had not dissipated, many people delivered the goods. The off-market interest rate was still standing at a high price of 2 jiao, 2 fen, 5 li and 2 jiao, 7. Immediate delivery was constantly selling short.

After 10:30, it was forced down to a low price of 210 yuan for immediate delivery and 217 yuan for deferred delivery, and then some people began to cover. Cement was sold urgently from 225 to the limit of the stop board, and then it was slightly recovered by No. 137 Weite. New Asia was sold from No. 191 to the stop board, but Yongsha's position stabilized, and the situation hovered, with few transactions. Extending to 11:15, yarn and flower gangs accepted slightly more, and the afternoon closing rose to 216 yuan and 224 yuan. Although the hot stocks fell, they did not fall much. Deferred Jingfu even rose slightly. Only deferred Xinhe fell the most by half a percent. The miscellaneous stocks fell more. New Asia fell to the limit, and Cement rebounded slightly after falling to the limit.

Afternoon

The off-market first called higher. Deferred Yongsha showed slightly when it appeared on the market, but after hearing the night report that there would be continued aid to China, it became weak again. Present Yongsha was as low as 218 yuan, and deferred Yongsha stopped at 223 yuan. Later, although the National Bank exchanged the difference, the upward trend could not last, and eventually ended in a consolidation. As a result, in comparison with the previous close, the immediate delivery stocks Yongsha, Xinguang, Zhongfa, Xinhua, Jing, Commerce, Zhongfang, Rongfeng, and Zhabei fell slightly, Xinhe, Huafeng, and Jingfu rose slightly, Meiya, Zhongsi, Huochai, and Lian were still flat, and Ni Nei fell by half a percent, while Cement New Asia rebounded after falling to the limit, closing down by half a percent. In terms of deferred delivery stocks, Yongsha, Xinhe, and Xinguang fell slightly, Huafeng was flat, and Meiya and Jingfu fell slightly. The off-market old stocks were relatively stable, except for Dasheng, which fell a little more.

### Flour Evaluation Meeting Scheduled for Next Monday

[This Newspaper] In order to rationalize the price of flour, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has decided to restore the flour price negotiation system with reference to the actual cost of manufacturers. The first flour evaluation meeting has been scheduled for 10:00 AM next Monday at the Social Affairs Bureau. The attending agencies will include the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Fourth District Flour Industry Association, the Municipal Flour Business Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, the China Trust Bureau, and the Materials Allocation Advisory Committee.

Also: The allocated price of flour is the same, but most of it is miscellaneous brand flour, which is actively being sold, and the market is firm. Miscellaneous brands have risen slightly, and the same is true for unified flour. Bran sales have turned sluggish and have fallen back by 1,000 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### A Bird's-Eye View of the World Literary Scene Over the Past 75 Years

— Zhao Jingshen

The editor asked me to write on this topic, limiting the word count to within 2,000 characters. This is truly a difficult task, but since I am a special contributor to this publication’s "Current World Literary Scene," I found it hard to refuse. I can only offer a rough overview.

The Shen Bao was founded in 1872. Coincidentally, this is close to the beginning of the Neo-Romanticism era. Most researchers of literary trends say that the period of Naturalism was from 1830 to 1870. Would it be inappropriate to consider 1871 as the beginning or gestation of Neo-Romanticism? Probably not.

Neo-Romanticism

The difference between Neo-Romanticism and Romanticism, in simple terms, is that the former is Romanticism that has passed through Naturalism, that is, Romanticism that has been baptized by science, while the latter is merely idealistic Romanticism. In other words, Romanticism seems to envision a realm of fantasy outside the world we live in, like a lark soaring in the sky, or dreaming of knights of the Middle Ages. But Neo-Romanticism wants to build a paradise on earth, and all the mystery and symbolism have passed through reality.

Neo-Romanticism includes the following various movements: Decadence, Symbolism, Aestheticism, Mysticism, Hedonism, all of which can be grouped together.

Decadence (Decndant) originated in France, around 1882. A group of young literary scholars gathered in the basement of a café in the Latin Quarter of Paris, singing and drinking, which marked the beginning of Decadent literature. Initially, this group was just a symbol, completely without meaning. Later, the famous poet Morias joined and changed the name to Decadence, meaning borrowing a term from French history of civilization for people in the declining period of Roman civilization. In addition to Morias, this school included Meends, Baudelaire, Veraine, Mallarme, Huysman, Regnier, etc., and was also known as Symbolism.

When this school spread to England, it became Aestheticism. Swinburne and Wilde were both great figures of this school. It is a well-known story that Wilde wore strange clothes and paraded through the streets holding a lily.

The masters of Mysticism include Maeterlinck and Verhaeren of Belgium. They often like to use mysterious themes, but in fact, they are just symbols of truth. Maeterlinck's fairy tale drama "The Blue Bird," which uses the blue bird to symbolize happiness, is well known.

Neo-Idealism

In Hakuson Kuriyagawa's famous book "Ten Lectures on Modern Literature" and Hisao Honma's "On Modern European Literary Trends," only Neo-Romanticism is discussed. Zhang Menglin's ("Reminiscence of Autumn Life") "Recent European Literary Trends" has a final chapter titled "Literary Trends in the Period of Transformation," but it also includes German Expressionism. Finally, it also mentions Neo-Idealism. However, Huang Lihua's "Modern Literary Trends" and Wu Yun's "Modern Literature" both directly use the general name of Neo-Idealism to include all 20th-century literature (such as Humanism, etc.), but these were all old works before 1928.

As the name suggests, Neo-Idealism has an ideal, that is, a kind of advocacy. The name Humanism is even more obvious. The difference between it and Naturalism lies in the fact that Naturalism only exposes the darkness of society and does not point out a bright path; it only describes the symptoms, but does not prescribe a prescription. But Neo-Idealism clearly shows us what we should do. Tolstoy and Rolland are the two giant stars of this movement. Tolstoy's "What is Art?" vigorously attacked the decadent Symbolists. Rolland's "Jean-Christophe" (translated by Fu Lei) has become a passionate favorite of Chinese youth.

Expressionism is mostly in the form of drama, starting from love for humanity. German writers opposed their country's warmongering. This type of drama can also be called "Shouting Drama," all of which are enthusiastic shouts, so they cannot write novels. See Liu Dajie's "The Literature of Expressionism" and "An Outline of German Literature" for details. Representative writers include Kaiser, Unruh, Toller, and Werfel. Of the above four, only Unruh is still alive; the others have passed away. Kaiser and Werfel both died in 1945, and Toller died in 1939.

Kiyoshi Naruse's "A Short History of Modern World Literature" and Takeo Chiba's "An Outline of Modern World Literature" want to use the First World War, which began in 1914, as a new boundary, but it seems that they cannot be simply summarized into a unified system. Naruse Kiyoshi said: "No matter which era it is, there are many literary circles that repel, combine, and intertwine with each other. Such a complicated and chaotic situation as the current literary circle has never been seen before." For example, the British D.H. Lawrence and James Joyce, who construct sexual psychology, have a feeling of being unclassifiable.

Neo-Realism

According to Yi Qun's "Basic Knowledge of Literature," the literature of the past ten years or so is called Neo-Realism, which is actually an extension of Neo-Idealism. If we focus on the Second World War, we might as well call it Democraticism. (Democraticism) This is a name I made up. I think this war was a struggle between the democratic camp and the fascist camp. Finally, the fascist German, Japanese, and Italian imperialism fell, and the democratic countries won. Most of the progressive German writers also fled abroad, opposing their country's measures. See my translation "Recent German Literature" published in "Bungei Shunju," Volume 5, Issue 3. The May issue of "Renaissance" has five long articles introducing the recent literary trends of five countries: Britain, the United States, Germany, France, and the Soviet Union.

For Soviet modern literature, see "The Road of Soviet Literature" and "The Road of Post-War Soviet Literature" (both published by Shidai Shubaoshe). For British modern literature, I bought a book by John Hayward, "Prose Literature Since 1939." Unfortunately, Stephen Spender's "Poetry Since 1939" and H. Reed's "Short Stories Since 1939" could not be bought. "Drama Since 1939" has no author yet. These four books are all included in the "Arts in Britain" series. There are also special books on architecture, dance, film, painting, and music, as well as the arts of Scotland and Wales. For the United States, I bought a book by Ludwig Lewisohn, "The Story of American Literature," which narrates up to the present. For France, I recommend Xu Zhongnian's "The Main Trends of French Literature." Except for the first chapter, all of them talk about modern French literature. Shangwu.

Finally, I would like to introduce a very important English book, that is, Horatio Smith's "Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature." Each entry is written by experts in the literature of various countries, who are responsible for signing their names. There are a total of 899 pages, with small font and double lines. A total of 237 professors were invited to write it. Even the literature of small countries such as Albania, Catalonia, Turkey, and Ukraine has an overview. It is really a book worth reading.

Due to space limitations today, there are also several articles such as Xu Weinan's "Shanghai Literature in the Past 75 Years" and Yu Jianhua's "Chinese Painting in the Past 75 Years," which will be published successively. "One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood" will be suspended for one day. We hereby declare this. (Editor)

### Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Dedication

Someone occasionally asked about "Chunqiu," saying, "'Chunqiu,' how tall is 'Chunqiu'?" I would like to answer like this: If "Chunqiu" can be said to represent one of the supplements of this newspaper, then this newspaper has been soliciting poems, ballads, and the like from poets and writers since the day it was founded, as the initial form of the supplement, it has only passed the age of seventy-seven. Although it is a long life for a person, it has only been three-quarters of a century in a career, and its qualifications are still shallow. If calculated from the publication of "Ziyoutan," it is only thirty-six years old, which is even younger. As for "Chunqiu" on "Chunqiu," it was founded in the 21st year of the Republic of China and is only fifteen years old today, just in its prime, which is even younger.

I often think that if "Ziyoutan" is the eldest son of this newspaper, then "Chunqiu" is just a little sister.

Therefore, it is because she is a little sister, young and ignorant, with unremoved childishness, who often cannot help but sing about the wind and the moon, interact with poets and writers, and like to quibble over words. This can also be said to be the family style of a scholarly family for seventy-five years. However, she has not forgotten the "spring plowing and summer weeding, autumn harvest and winter storage" of cultivation and harvest; she is sincere, frank, and pure, and she symbolizes her pursuit of truth, goodness, and beauty with the two characters "Chunqiu," just like Confucius used "Chunqiu" to rectify names and define divisions. She believes that as long as the spirit of truth, goodness, and beauty is universally promoted, rebellious officials and traitors will disappear without a trace. Of course, this kind of thinking is somewhat out of tune with the times. But she doesn't care.

Some people also say that since the national newspaper supplements originated in Shen Bao, then the source of Shen Bao's supplement should be the beginning of the national newspaper supplements. So, why does a newspaper have a supplement? What is the definition of a supplement? Yes, the emergence of the supplement, like the emergence of the newspaper, has its own reasons. So, it might as well try to formulate a definition today:

Any literary, specialized academic, and all knowledgeable and interesting texts on newspapers, which are published on fixed pages to meet the trends of the times and the needs of readers, are called supplements.

The status of supplements, according to the development of the newspaper industry, can be said to be as important as the main publication (commentary and news pages). Its function and value are: (1) to cooperate with newspaper commentary and news, (2) to introduce ideas, scholarship, and knowledge and skills, (3) to regulate and increase readers' interest, (5) to provide readers with the opportunity to publish texts and exchange opinions.

As for the supplement editor, for the supplement, it is like a nanny; for the reader, it is like a chef, and some people say it is a gardener. In fact, whether it is a nanny, a chef, or a gardener, in the final analysis, it is just a servant. However, according to the custom of democratic countries, all government officials, from the president down, can call themselves public servants. In this way, how fortunate is the supplement editor! In fact, it is not necessarily the case.

Now, on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of this newspaper and the commemorative birthday of the 25,000th issue, the editor cannot be without a word. Therefore, I will briefly discuss the general meaning of the supplement based on what I know, in order to correct the previous editors, writing authors, and readers who love this publication, and to wish you peace and happiness!

### Old Records of "Chunqiu"

— Shou

How fast! Seventy-five springs and autumns have passed since this newspaper was published. If it is compared to a person, then he is an old gentleman of seventy-five years old with high moral character. The author entered the museum in the eighth year of the Republic of China and was fortunate enough to be an old partner of his for thirty years. In this long life history of seventy-five years, I unconsciously consumed most of my years. He has indeed overcome one difficult situation after another with deep roots, and the author has also shed tears and has seen the vicissitudes of life. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War until after the victory, the author has not participated in actual work in the museum, just like Miaoyu in the Grand View Garden in "Dream of the Red Chamber," who is an outsider. However, no matter what, the outsider is still in the wall circle of the Grand View Garden, and of course, we share the joys and sorrows, and we feel the same pain. I thought that after braving the dangerous waves, it was easy to see the moonlight and wind again, which is already a commendable and congratulatory thing. What's more, he is getting stronger as he gets older and is revitalizing his family business. Not only does he not have any signs of old age, but he is returning to his childhood and is full of vigor and vitality. So, how can we old partners not be happy and celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday?

Brother Wang Jinshan, the editor of Chunqiu, urged me to narrate some of the circumstances of the founding of the journal because I was the founder of Chunqiu. This is just like the people of the Tianbao Palace telling the story of Kaiyuan. It is inevitable that I will feel a lot of emotion. I have been editing "Ziyoutan" for more than ten years, and I have always dealt with it conscientiously. In the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the late General Manager Shi Gongliang wanted to change the taste of the readers, so he specially invited Mr. Li Liewen to assist in the management, to collect articles from some new writers, and still ordered me to be responsible for reviewing and editing. I was originally a good old man, and I could do everything. I obeyed the order respectfully. However, after a few days, the submitted articles were often not reviewed by me, and they were published on their own, which made me a mere figurehead, doing nothing. Therefore, I had to know that it was difficult to retreat and express my intention to let Xian to Shi Gong. Thanks to Shi Gong's old feelings and kindness, he insisted on keeping me and said, "Since 'Ziyoutan' has changed its nature, you might as well have another supplement, and you can lead an army alone and work hard." Out of gratitude, I used the silly spirit that a scholar would die for his confidant and hurriedly recruited troops and bought horses, determined to do a good job. Finally, in January of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Chunqiu was founded, and the name Chunqiu was also decided after repeated discussions with Shi Gong.

I have always taken an eclectic attitude when editing supplements. I welcome the new school of manuscripts, and I do not discriminate against the old school. The main purpose is to be meaningful and interesting. I also strive for beauty in the arrangement of formats and the embellishment of books. Therefore, at the beginning of the publication, in terms of writing, I specially invited Mr. Cheng Zhanlu to write "Zhanlu Random Notes," Mr. Wang Zhongxian to write "Shanghai Gossip," and I also wrote a kind of "Violet Tea Talk," which were published in turn under the headline, in the first place. In the middle, I arranged a short story, which was Mr. Sun Honglei's "Guilt," and at the bottom, I arranged a special column, divided into twelve kinds: "New Invention," "Small Common Sense," "Travel in Art," "Small Gardening," "Small Novel," "Character Sketch," "Custom Sketch," "World Rare News," "Travel Traces," "Children's Paradise," "Women's Paradise," and "Laughter Mobilization," publishing one kind every day, and the material seemed to be very substantial. On the one hand, I also specially invited the famous painter Mr. Fang Xueli to be responsible for the design of the paintings. The headlines of the newspaper were changed from horizontal to vertical from time to time, and a small and exquisite pattern had to be matched with each article. The titles of the special columns and novels were also specially drawn according to their meanings. Therefore, from the surface, there was a kind of colorfulness. Later, when I got tired of short stories, I specially invited Mr. Zhang Henshui to write long stories, including "Four Company Commanders of Northeast," "Little West Heaven," and "Changing Nest Orioles and Phoenixes" (this work was not finished due to the outbreak of the August 13th War). Mr. Qin Shouou also translated a "Record of Imperial Fragrant Silk" by Ms. Deling, which were all well-known at the time. When the special columns were used up, I specially selected a few small and sophisticated works and compiled them into a small Chunqiu column, just like a kangaroo's pouch, with a small kangaroo in it, which was very interesting! I have to mention here that I have received a lot of help from my brother Huang Jiping in the past few years. To this day, we still maintain a warm friendship, which has not changed for a long time.

Shi Gong seemed to pay special attention to the supplement, so I was often summoned to discuss everything at that time. He once said to me with a smile: "Don't underestimate the small newspaper butt, it is very important to the circulation of the entire newspaper." Under his constant supervision, I dared not do my best. Now, more than ten years have passed since the day Shi Gong was killed. Recalling his last words, I am very sad!

"Ziyoutan" Seventy-fifth Anniversary Special Issue

### "Ziyoutan" in the Past Thirty-six Years

— Zheng Fan

Counting on my fingers, "Ziyoutan" has a history of thirty-six years. In the Chinese newspaper industry, a newspaper that can stand firm for decades is rare. And a newspaper supplement that can stand firm for decades along with the growth of the newspaper is even rarer. If there is one, it is only "Ziyoutan."

We cannot say that thirty-six years is a long time, but in these thirty-six years, in terms of the domestic situation, it was the most important period of change in Chinese history. The Chinese people experienced the Xinhai Revolution and were liberated from the oppression of the Qing Dynasty. They experienced the Northern Expedition and awakened from the oppression of the warlords. They also experienced the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and raised their heads from the oppression of imperialism. It includes the entire history of the Republic of China. At the same time, in the Chinese newspaper industry, these thirty-six years were also a period from the formation to the enrichment of the modern Chinese newspaper industry.

And "Ziyoutan" grew and thrived in these thirty-six years. In any issue of "Ziyoutan," you can smell the atmosphere of that era. In these thirty-six years, "Ziyoutan" has also experienced vicissitudes of life: it used to be a place for the Saturday School to talk about love, and it used to be a place for new writers to fight fiercely. The published texts ranged from qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting to European and American styles, from game ink to self-cultivation sketches, almost all-inclusive. However, although the style and content have changed again and again with the evolution of the times, there is only one principle that has remained unchanged - that is, it has always been a veritable "Ziyoutan," talking freely, without prejudice, and without restraint!

"Ziyoutan" is not only the longest-lived supplement in China, but also the earliest supplement to appear in China.

When we narrate the history of "Ziyoutan" here, we must mention the origin of Chinese newspaper supplements. Newspapers have been publishing some poems and essays for a long time, mostly attached to the news. The Tongwen Hubao, published in 1900, included a "Tongwen Leisure Record" with the newspaper, which was completely in the style of a small newspaper and not the form of a supplement to a major newspaper. But the establishment of a formal supplement started with "Ziyoutan."

On the first day of the seventh lunar month of the third year of Xuantong in the late Qing Dynasty (August 24, 1911), the Shen Bao authorities announced a reform of the editing policy with the motto "The world is progressing day by day, and human affairs are becoming more and more complicated," taking into account both seriousness and liveliness. Ziyoutan met the readers on this day. Initially, it was edited by Wang Dungen, and most of the published articles were game texts, such as "Overseas Anecdotes," "How Can This Be True?" and "For Your Amusement," as well as some poems and parallel texts, and overlapping-character poems, etc., and long-form translated novels were serialized every day. At that time, the target was the general gentry class and business people in the society, and the content was limited to entertainment texts after tea and dinner.

From March 18th of the fourth year of the Republic of China, Wu Juemi took over the editing work, and the editing policy remained the same as before. He once solicited poems and articles from soldiers to stimulate the national spirit of martial arts.

After a year, Yao Yuanchu took over the editing work of "Ziyoutan" (April 1, 1916), and slightly changed the content of "Ziyoutan," focusing on old literature, publishing the most poems and articles from the Nanshe Society, which became a unique garden for Nanshe Society members to publish their poems and articles for a time. In addition, a small garden called "Ziyoutan's Ziyoutan" was opened.

Yao Yuanchu edited for a full six months, and from October 31st of the same year, it was taken over by Tian Xuwo Sheng (Chen Xuyuan). At that time, in addition to publishing sketches and essays, he also published some texts such as "Family Common Sense," so that this supplement not only allowed readers to appreciate its texts, but also gave readers practical benefits, which was quite popular with readers at that time.

In addition to managing the literary career, Tian Xuwo Sheng was also committed to national enterprises. After the seventh year of the Republic of China, Tian Xuwo Sheng had become an entrepreneur. Therefore, Xu was edited by Chen Lengxue (that is, Mr. Chen Jinghan, the publisher of this newspaper). Mr. Lengxue's moral articles have always been admired by the world, and his sharp and powerful short comments have long been well-known in the Chinese newspaper industry. At this time, "Ziyoutan" focused on short and精悍short comments, which hit the current malpractices and were deeply loved by readers. (Above)

### Eulogy

— Ji Qiu'an

The saying goes: There is nothing difficult in the world, only afraid of people with hearts. Knowing that the world's successful things can only be done by those with hearts, but those with hearts for themselves will have small success, and those with hearts for the public will have great success. There are only journalists who have hearts for the public and work tirelessly every day, collecting all things and spreading them across the world, day after day, line after line, and endlessly, from self-cultivation, family management, governance, and peace in the world. Everything is complete. And especially filial piety, brotherhood, loyalty, trust, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the main points. Every time there is an editorial, it is explained in detail. Although it is in a noisy and competitive world, it still contains the style of morality and propriety, such as Speaker Pan's commemoration of the Double Eighth Father's Day. Your newspaper sincerely praises it, making people know that filial piety should be done to the fullest. Those who see it feel it is the essence, knowing that the sky has not lost this article. Therefore, those who are trusted by your newspaper's editors use Dong Hu's pen and Li Lou's vision. Many scholars gather in one hall to draft, discuss, modify, and embellish, each doing their best. The manuscript is published as soon as it is received, and when it is published, it is made public. Therefore, reading your newspaper, you can know the affairs of the world without going out, how happy is this! Therefore, wherever your newspaper goes, everyone says "Old Shen Bao," neither rigid nor soft, neither biased nor leaning, and many people compete to read it. From west to east, from south to north, no one is not convinced. In terms of recording events, it can compete with the national history for glory. In terms of merit, it can be compared with Gan Tang. Moreover, it was founded early and has a long history. Among the same industry in the country, there is no one like it. Even if we examine the countries, it is rare. Since its publication, it has reformed politics, improved culture, prospered commerce, and developed reclamation and animal husbandry, all of which have been guided in detail. It also advises people not to do good because it is small, and not to do evil because it is small, hoping that the world will be full of good people, turning the national fortune to prosperity and the people to live and work in peace. The intention is like this, how great is the merit! And especially not afraid of trouble, day and night, like a Bodhisattva saving people from suffering and difficulties, watching the waves of humanity, wanting to quickly help the world, wanting to use a brush to spread the Yangzhi branch, to purify the world, to solve the upside down, and to promote this ambition, can be against heaven and earth, can be against gods, can be against the world, its merit and virtue are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, what is it like! Therefore, all people of insight know that your newspaper is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its founding and the publication of its 25,000th issue, and they have launched a joint celebration ceremony to celebrate the middle newspaper. The friendship is deep and the meaning is profound. It is also the way to receive grace and not forget it. Your newspaper is selfless, presenting everything and giving it to others. This is truly the beauty of being happy alone is not as good as being with others, and being happy with a few is not as good as being with the masses. Mencius said: Boyi is the pure one among the sages, Yi Yin is the responsible one among the sages, Liu Xiahui is the harmonious one among the sages, and Confucius is the timely one among the sages. Looking at all the newspapers, purity, responsibility, and harmony are all available, and all can be in the ranks of sages, but your newspaper alone has obtained its time and can be passed down with the timely sages. The timely sages are always respected for thousands of generations, and I think your newspaper is also like this. Therefore, on the occasion of the life of your newspaper, I also respectfully praise it and say:

The life of your newspaper is as long as the Southern Mountain.

May all of you enjoy this.

Li Qiu'an respectfully presented on August 15th, 36th year of the Republic of China, at the age of 69.

### Editor's Message

Happily celebrating the 75th anniversary of this newspaper, standing in the position of an editor, I cannot but say a few words.

"Free Talk" has had a glorious history. Precisely because it has had a magnificent journey, the editor feels the responsibility is all the more arduous.

Every day, when you sit at the desk, you come into contact with all kinds of readers, accusing you of the darkness of society, blaming you for the hardship of life, calling out to you for the corruption of the wealthy. In the lines of text, sometimes you can see their tears, sometimes you can breathe in their anger and resentment.

After eight years of the War of Resistance, everything is still on the road to recovery, and many situations of separation and chaos are naturally unavoidable. All the unsatisfactory situations, we can say with certainty, will definitely slowly get better. The decayed will surely die, and the newborn will surely grow. Metabolism - this is the inevitable development of history. During the "transformation" period of the summer cicada, the mother body naturally feels great pain.

The Chinese people are now in this state of being neither fully alive nor fully dead. We should look forward to the future. Under the blue wilderness, with golden clouds filling the sky, there are naturally beautiful sceneries.

颓丧 · 消沉 (Dejection and depression), this is a shameful term. The more difficult a person's life is, the more he will appreciate the meaning of life.

From the founding of "Free Talk" to now, it has been thirty-six years and one month. In these long years, you can see how much fighting spirit it contains.

The future focus of "Free Talk" is still to cooperate with the newsworthiness and strengthen the introduction of science and knowledge. Wise readers and authors are expected to give us greater assistance.

In the past few months, the editor should thank many authors for taking the time to write for this publication. We should sincerely express our highest gratitude!

--Tai Sheng, September 19th.

### Familiar People Don't Follow Etiquette

--Wei Zhuang

There is a Western saying that means: "Familiar things are inevitably despised." The newspapers we see every day seem like very close friends in our daily lives. Because we are used to seeing them and are familiar with them, we don't take them seriously. Moreover, due to the close relationship, we unknowingly develop the habit of being disrespectful.

People often say that the arguments in newspapers are always clichés, neither painful nor itchy; the records in newspapers inevitably repeat what others say, being all the same. These opinions and criticisms are understandable from the perspective of general readers. However, in all fairness, newspapers are like a recording machine of society, and like a mirror. What they produce and reflect cannot be separated from the real environment of society. Only with a stable society can there be an ideal newspaper. Ragged wool cannot weave a beautiful carpet, so we cannot solely blame the newspaper for not making progress.

The *Shen Bao* was born on this day seventy-five years ago. If we compare it to a person's life, seventy-five years has already exceeded the age of seventy, and it can be said to be a sign of longevity. Not to mention domestically, even among the famous daily newspapers in the world today, its peers in 1872 are likely only the American "Bosten Globe" (the German "Berliner Tageblatt" was also founded in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, but it is unknown whether it still exists). Even based on the principle that rare things are precious, it is worth our attention!

In the past half-century of unscientific China, it is a miracle in our cultural history and academic circles that the *Shen Bao* has been able to remain intact and grow to this day. How many famous universities in China are as old as the *Shen Bao*? None. Which academic research institution in China has a history like that of the *Shen Bao*? None either... In the past turbulent and unstable seventy-five years, the *Shen Bao* has served society and spoken for the people in a steady and unyielding spirit, enduring hardships, struggling to survive, and forming a leading transportation agency with a sense of public community (Gemeinschaft). The *Shen Bao* calls itself "the oldest," which it truly deserves, and it is only natural that we give it due respect.

Given the vastness of China's territory and the size of its population, even ten or a hundred *Shen Bao* would not be too many. However, the current reality is not so. Society should show more care for newspapers, needless to say. As for the so-called new newspapers that are emerging, they should be well nurtured so that the foundation of China's newspaper industry is more solid and far-reaching.

As the saying goes, "Familiar people don't follow etiquette." Although the *Shen Bao* is an old friend we see every day for ten or several decades, on this occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary, when we see it in the morning, we seem to need to express some respect in our hearts.

The highest leader has instructed us to respect the elderly and love the young. May readers fully understand this point!

### Trivial Recollections of an Old Shen Bao Employee

--Retired Old Soldier

The *Shen Bao* "elder" is seventy-five years old this year. The twentieth of this month is her big birthday. All the colleagues of this newspaper are offering her a toast for longevity, which is very pleasing.

But this "elder" was originally an American, born and raised in Shanghai. It was not until the 30th year of Guangxu (?) that she acquired Chinese citizenship, so she can be considered a Chinese. Therefore, while it is appropriate to commemorate the "elder's" seventy-fifth birthday, I believe the year she joined the Chinese nationality should especially be commemorated, as she has only been fully considered Chinese for forty-five or six years.

The *Shen Bao* was originally founded by the American company Meizha, and was an American Chinese-language newspaper. The Chinese manager was Xi Junzimei. After Zimei's death, his disciple Zipei took over. In the 30th year of Guangxu, the company had no intention of running the *Shen Bao*, so it was taken over by Xi Junzi Zipei. Thus, the *Shen Bao* began to break away from American nationality and formally entered our country's territory.

After Zipei bought the *Shen Bao*, he wanted to make major changes, so he invited Jin Junjianhua to be the editor-in-chief, and Zhang Junjiqi, my brother Yunhe, and I to be editors. Others, such as Sun Yusheng and Lei Junyao, were all old employees of the newspaper. The translator was Yan Junjunqing (?). Yan Jun had a limp, a gun wound on his forehead, and carried a walking stick. He would arrive late in the evening, and the tea servant would immediately place a chair next to his desk, and bring him Western newspapers such as *Shi Lin* and *Wen Wei*. Yan Jun would smoke a cigar, open the newspapers and orally translate five or six telegrams, or as many as six or seven. The one in charge of writing was mostly Lei Junyao. The time was no more than half an hour or so, but the treatment was exceptionally good. At that time, the eight-legged essay era, English was quite valuable. Unfortunately, Yan Jun did not work for long before leaving. He was succeeded by Lu Jundaquan, and later by Yan Yiting.

The address of the *Shen Bao* was originally at the east end of Jiangxi Road on Sanma Road, where the offices of various bureaus of the current municipal government are located, opposite the so-called Red Church. The typesetting room and the editorial department were both upstairs, separated by a public alley. A hemp rope was tied across the window, with a tin can tied to the end of the rope. Manuscripts for typesetting were all placed in this can for sending and receiving, and proofs were also handled in the same way. At that time, the most important news was nothing more than official documents and memorials from senior officials in various provinces. Other news, such as "local news," was also very scarce, or simply used what had been collected by others. As for "local news," theft and fires were already excellent material. However, the daily essay was required to be 1,200 characters, no more and no less. The plates were set every day before dinner. How different it was from nowadays, when work must be completed by four or five in the morning.

At that time, I was fascinated by English and not interested in a reporter's career. I only worked as a writer for a year or so. Then, the governor-general of Liangjiang, Wei Guanglian, opened a higher school in Nanjing, so I resigned from the newspaper and entered the school. Before long, my brother also left the *Shen Bao* to go to Japan to study education. Upon his return, Mr. Zhi Zanxi founded the *Southern Newspaper* at the intersection of Jiangxi Road on Sima Road, inviting us to take on editorial duties. Zanxi was the brother of Consort Zhen. Because Consort Zhen lost favor with the Empress Dowager Cixi and fell into a well to die, Zanxi took refuge in Shanghai and founded this newspaper. Unexpectedly, because it published the happy news of Prince Zhen's marriage to the famous actress Yang Jiexi, Prince Qing was furious and telegraphed the governor-general of Liangjiang, Duan Fang, to order its closure. At that time, Prince Qing was a Grand Councilor and concurrently the Minister in Charge of Foreign Affairs, and was greatly relied upon by the Empress Dowager Cixi. There was no way to resist, and the *Southern Newspaper* had to die prematurely at that time.

At that time, the *Shen Bao* had moved to Wangping Street, originally the address of the Youyicun Western restaurant. The editor-in-chief, Sun Jundongwu, felt that there was a shortage of editors in the office. Hearing that the *Southern Newspaper* had closed, he strongly urged me and Xi Junzi Zipei to go there. Zhi Jun still intended to organize a new newspaper and asked me not to take other jobs. I refused because of the relationship. Xi and Sun insisted again and again, and I finally agreed, but I asked to rest at home for two months before coming to work, partly to rest and partly to see what Zhi Jun was up to. After I returned home, the incident of Xu Xilin assassinating the Anhui Governor Enming occurred, and Zhi Jun's plan to reorganize was not realized for a while. So I re-entered the *Shen Bao* for the second time. My brother Yunhe also re-entered the *Shen Bao* the following year. At that time, the organization of the *Shen Bao*'s editorial department was still very simple. There were few editors, and one proofreader also served as a news editor, so often the editing and proofreading were done by one person. At this time, I was most diligent in my duties as a reporter. Unexpectedly, in the third year of Xuantong, I developed a disease and left the office to recuperate. After more than a year of not recovering, I finally resigned.

In the ninth year of the Republic, I entered the *Shen Bao* again. This was the third time I entered the *Shen Bao*. At this time, the *Shen Bao* building was located where it is now. The shareholder and manager was Mr. Shi Liangcai. He had taken over from Xi Junzi Zipei in the first year of the Republic. Every time I enter the *Shen Bao*, it moves once. Every time I enter the *Shen Bao*, it also prospers once. The advancement of the giant wheel of the times is truly endless.

Note: I am quite forgetful. I cannot remember the years and months clearly in this account, and there may be errors in the names, but in general, they are not too far off.

### Mr. Pan Gongzhan Encourages the Colleagues of This Newspaper

--Pan Gongzhan

Although the history of the newspaper business in China is less than a hundred years old, this newspaper has occupied 25,000 issues over seventy-five years. This newspaper has undeniably fulfilled a major part of its responsibility in promoting China's modernization. Around the Xinhai Revolution and the Northern Expedition, newspaper people promoted public opinion with sincere revolutionary enthusiasm, overthrowing autocracy and sweeping away warlords. After the start of the War of Resistance, people in the news media shed blood and sweat in the occupied areas and the rear, fighting hard to support the government's long-term war of resistance policy. In the past two years, newspaper people across the country have been working towards the goal of national unity and construction after the war. In short, every time the opportunity arrives, news reporters have stood at the forefront, unafraid and unwavering, fulfilling their greatest responsibility. As we commemorate this newspaper's anniversary, I will briefly state my personal feelings about the newspaper business, in order to encourage myself and my colleagues.

A news reporter is an extremely heavy and arduous profession. But in recent years, the progress of the news industry and the rapid increase in practitioners have shown that more and more people have developed an interest and confidence in this work. Why is this? Because everyone has come to realize that the news business is a meaningful and valuable job that has a great impact on the future of the country and human civilization. The meaning of life lies in seeking to serve the majority and benefit the majority, like a torch, igniting the brilliance of one's life to illuminate the future for thousands of people walking in the darkness. To achieve this goal, the news business can be said to be the most ideal job. Because a news reporter's word or sentence can affect hundreds of thousands or even millions of readers and generate great power.

Precisely because of this, we news reporters must be more cautious and vigilant. If we report a false message or express a wrong view, imagine the adverse consequences it will have on society. Therefore, we news reporters bear not only a professional responsibility, but also a moral and social responsibility. A news reporter must never rely solely on his own likes and dislikes, or indulge in temporary emotions; we should consider the mission it bears to society and the possible impact of any word or sentence, always taking into account the entire environment. We should guide people on the right path, report more constructive news, so that they can always see the bright prospects ahead, and encourage the upward power of the whole society. Only in this way can a news reporter truly assume the responsibility of correct public opinion.

Achieving this goal is not an easy task. It requires knowledge, cultivation, experience, and courage. So I often feel that, although the qualifications of news reporters have not yet been clearly defined, it is more difficult to be a good news reporter than to engage in any other profession. Now there are news reporter associations in all parts of the country, but there has never been a clear legal provision on what qualifications are required to be a news reporter. Other freelance professions, such as doctors, lawyers, and accountants, have strict requirements for their qualifications. In the education sector, whether it is a university professor, lecturer, or primary and secondary school teacher, they must be approved or certified. Only news reporters have no regulations. In this case, I hope that our news reporters can cherish their sacred position. Since we cannot prove that we are qualified to be a news reporter based on clear qualifications, we must prove that we are qualified to be a news reporter based on the facts of our work. We should constantly review and reflect on our words and deeds, establish a good reputation in society, and gain their confidence. Only then can we exert the leadership role of news reporters in society. News reporters must first respect themselves in order to gain the respect of others.

As mentioned above, being a news practitioner is not an easy task. It requires knowledge and experience, as well as a high degree of service spirit and courage. In today's news technology with increasing progress and news competition becoming increasingly fierce, I feel that a good reporter should at least possess the following four characters.

The first character is: "True". The prerequisite for news is truth. News that deviates from the truth is nothing more than a rumor. Untrue news, whether intentional or unintentional, is inexcusable. Any news we collect must be done to the best of our ability, to find ways to determine whether this news is true. This kind of judgment sometimes relies on the confirmation of other news sources, sometimes on one's own understanding and observation of the matter, and sometimes on one's own knowledge and experience of a certain issue, to compare and verify with the news obtained, in order to determine its truth. In short, we must make the most thorough judgment in the fastest time, so that only true and valuable news appears in the newspaper. It must be known that an untrue message, or an untrue view and criticism arising from it, will affect the reputation of one's own news report and give people a bad impression, as far as the newspaper itself is concerned. In terms of external impact, to a small extent, it harms the reputation of a person, a thing, or a certain group, making it difficult for people to clear up even if they make corrections; to a large extent, it may even cause social unrest and instability, affect the security of the entire country, and even lead to international suspicion and disputes, which is not impossible. From this, we can know how important the truthfulness of news is. News reporters should have the confidence and sincerity to pursue the truth; news should seek its "truth," which is indeed the first condition for being a good reporter.

The second character is: "Swift". Due to the invention of radio and radio facsimile, the progress of modern communication technology is rapid. The most important thing about news is its timeliness, so speed is also an essential condition for a news reporter. Modern newspaper competition is very fierce, so after a reporter obtains accurate news, he must notify the newspaper by phone, telegraph, or radio in the fastest way possible. Before the end of this World War, when the Allied forces landed in Normandy and crossed the Damtain River, reporters from all armies used every means to send the news to their newspapers three or five minutes earlier than others, and broadcast it immediately in order to gain time. But the "swift" character we are talking about here must first have the first "true" character in order to have value. Because only true news is worth reporting quickly; otherwise, if we want to be fast and rashly send out news that has not been confirmed to be true, only to find out that it is unreliable, and then send a telegram to cancel or correct it, it is not only a great waste of materials, but also a great loss of credit. If it has already been published and there is no time to correct it, wouldn't it cause even more adverse consequences? Therefore, this "swift" character must go hand in hand with the "true" character to have value; "swift and detailed", neither can be missing. How to find ways to verify the truthfulness of news in the shortest time, and then send it out in the fastest way, is a question that a news reporter should pay close attention to and study.

The third character is: "Careful". This is especially important for those who are engaged in editing work. As mentioned above, since the impact of newspapers is so great, when we decide whether to publish a piece of news, we should not only consider whether it is beneficial to our own newspaper, but also consider the possible impact of the publication of this piece of news on groups, society, or the country. Sometimes, we clearly know that this news is true and swift, but for the sake of the whole society and the country, we are afraid that it will have adverse consequences, and we would rather give it up. Newspapers are a social undertaking, bearing the important mission of social culture, so we must never be like general commercial companies, who sell goods as long as they are profitable, and never ask whether customers may suffer losses. Our newspapers have such a great impact on society and such a heavy responsibility, so we should carefully weigh the pros and cons and weigh the importance of any news we publish in order to determine whether to adopt it or not. A person who works as an editor must have extremely clear judgment in this regard.

The fourth character is: "Diligent". Diligence is a necessary condition for success in any matter, but the "diligent" character possessed by a news reporter must include three aspects, namely: diligent in work, diligent in learning, and diligent in reviewing. The so-called diligent in work means that he must make the greatest effort to enable his own duties to achieve the expected results, so that every part of the organic nature of the newspaper can reach the ideal state. The so-called diligent in learning means that a news reporter must not forget to improve himself in his work, so that he will never lag behind. The development and progress of world thought, knowledge, and science is very rapid. If we do not diligently learn from time to time, but only stick to our own work, then as a result, we will definitely feel that we are out of touch with the times and lagging behind the times. Only knowing work and not knowing learning can never be a good news reporter for a long time. Therefore, news reporters must embrace the spirit of "daily renewal and daily renewal," and maintain close contact with world trends and cultural knowledge at all times, learning in work and using learning to assist work. Finally, speaking of diligent in reviewing, it is also very important. On the one hand, we must constantly review our own work to see if there is anything that can be improved; on the other hand, we should also review the advantages and disadvantages of our own newspaper, and make a comparison with other newspapers. Moreover, we should also try our best to welcome the review of our newspaper by the general public. What news does others have that we don't? Is it because we neglected to interview it? Or is it because we feel that it is not suitable for publication or not worth publishing, so we automatically delete it? What are other people's advantages and disadvantages? We must understand other people's advantages in order to see our own shortcomings and find ways to remedy them; we must also see other people's shortcomings in order to understand our own advantages and preserve and promote them. This kind of review work on one's own work and the entire newspaper is what a good news reporter must do.

If a news reporter can understand the sacredness of his mission and the importance of his responsibility, and at the same time strive to achieve the conditions of these four characters, "True", "Swift", "Careful", and "Diligent", in his work, then, I think, he will surely become an ideal news reporter, and he will surely be able to strive for the brightness of his career and the strength of the country in his own work position. On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of this newspaper, I have especially recorded these few words to share with my colleagues in this newspaper.

### The Old Shen Bao

Newspapers are historical material of the contemporary era. Whenever later generations wish to know the course of an event or the important endeavors of a person, newspapers contain detailed records. However, the news published in newspapers occurs at any time and is recorded sequentially. If there are interruptions, it will inevitably be incomplete. Therefore, the value of collecting newspapers and periodicals lies in persistence, without allowing interruptions.

The Shen Bao has been published for seventy-five years. This period coincides with a time of dramatic change in China, with successive foreign troubles. In politics, it went through the Reform Movement of 1898, the Xinhai Revolution, and the Northern Expedition before laying the foundation for democratic politics. It also experienced the Second World War, during which our country fought the Japanese invaders alone for eight long years, and half of our country's territory was lost and regained. In economics, steamships, trains, and other Western material civilizations flowed into ancient China, changing China's mode of production. Social systems also fell into a state of chaos, with traditional old ethics abandoned by the youth, while new morals have not yet been established. Therefore, everything shows a sudden change.

To investigate China's domestic and international political situation, society, economy, cultural relics, and systems in recent decades, newspapers are the best material. This newspaper has a longer history and records more events, and it focuses on cultural aspects, which has attracted the attention of modern historians. Therefore, the complete set of Shen Bao from the past seventy-five years is not only a record of the development of this newspaper but also an important document for modern China and the world. The seventy-five-year-old Shen Bao currently stored in this newspaper's archives is the biggest asset and a priceless treasure of this newspaper.

Currently, according to the author's knowledge, there are two complete and intact sets of the Shen Bao from the past seventy-five years. One is stored in this newspaper, and the other is in the Xujiahui Library. Collecting is a kind of interest, and maintaining that interest for a long time is not an easy task. It is even more difficult for descendants to inherit the aspirations of their ancestors if a person cannot complete the task in their lifetime. Furthermore, there have been frequent changes and unrest in the past seventy-five years, and people's livelihoods have been unstable, making it difficult to prevent collections from being scattered. Libraries are public undertakings and can collect for a long time. However, when this newspaper was founded, it was the early stage of modern Chinese culture, and there were not many libraries, and they did not know how to collect newspapers. The copy in the Xuhui Library is indeed rare.

Not only did others not know how to preserve this complete collection of the modern historical document that is the Shen Bao, but this newspaper itself did not preserve it well. Because when Medhurst founded the Shen Bao, he was entirely focused on business and did not regard it as a very precious document. Perhaps he did not expect the Shen Bao to have such a long history and become a respected elder in the Chinese newspaper world. Therefore, at first, they only asked about making money, only cared about publishing, and did not know how to preserve it. This is really a laughable matter.

The Shen Bao that we now collect, complete and intact, was made possible by the great kindness of Mr. Zhang Zhongzhao. Mr. Zhang is an old friend of the Shen Bao. Since the publication of the Shen Bao, Mr. Zhang has purchased and read it every day and cherished it after reading. From the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty until the Xinhai Revolution, he never stopped for forty years. After Mr. Shi Liangcai took over this newspaper, he regarded it as a great regret that he published the newspaper but could not preserve it himself. Therefore, he published an advertisement publicly requesting a complete set. Mr. Zhang immediately presented his forty-year collection and returned it to this newspaper. The kindness and enthusiasm of Mr. Zhang will be forever remembered by this newspaper, and his contribution to the preservation of modern cultural relics is indelible.

### Brief Announcement

We are delighted to celebrate the anniversary of the newspaper. Today, we are publishing an additional three and a half pages for this commemorative special issue. We are grateful to the founding fathers of the Party and the country, and to the scholars from all walks of life, for their kind contributions of articles or calligraphy. We are deeply moved by your lofty sentiments and friendship. Due to space limitations, we were unable to include everything. We express our deepest apologies and boundless gratitude.

### Thoughts on the 25,000th Issue of the Shen Bao

— Shi Yonggeng

Seventy-five years have passed since the Shen Bao was born. Comparing it to a human life, it is older than I am. I feel that my experience is not deep enough to trace back to the distant past; even with my knowledge, much is vague. On this auspicious occasion of commemoration, I only feel a sense of lingering reluctance. To be asked to express my thoughts is like a circle without end. I will, therefore, offer a few humble observations.

The entire Shen Bao can be divided into two periods: the period before my late father, Liangcai, took over, and the period after my late father's management. I do not know the details of the first period. Based on my understanding, I rely on Mr. Guang's account. My late father said that he dedicated his life to the newspaper industry, so he spared no effort to exert his mind and energy to approach it and put his heart and soul into it. If a plan was not perfect, he found it difficult to enjoy his meals, and if a review was accidentally omitted, he would stay up all night. At that time, the two gentlemen, Chen Jinghan and Zhang Yunhe, were powerful assistants to my late father. Mr. Chen maintained an impartial and unbiased attitude, holding a just opinion without fail. Mr. Zhang maintained a consistent spirit, never faltering or yielding, for thirty years. This enabled my late father's ambitions to be further developed, and the future of the Shen Bao became increasingly promising. I once heard my late father say, "Without Mr. Chen Guangsheng's fair and just arguments, the Shen Bao could not have gained the support of a large number of readers. Without Mr. Zhang's peaceful and comprehensive measures, the colleagues could not have achieved a harmonious effect from top to bottom." This was not just my late father's personal opinion, but something I alone heard in the courtyard, and it is agreed upon by all the people of the newspaper. Anyone who is familiar with the actual situation can recognize this as an immutable assessment. Other gentlemen, such as Zhang Zhuping and Wang Yingbin, put their heart into the business management of the newspaper, not leaving any stone unturned, and their contribution cannot be ignored.

Now the Shen Bao has reached its 25,000th issue. The abundance of the autumn harvest is guided by cultivation; the magnificence of the new building is due to the hard work of the builders. My late father and Mr. Zhang both gave their all but were unable to personally witness this grand occasion. Recalling the past, how can one not feel a sense of sorrow! Fortunately, Mr. Chen is still responsible for the distribution of the Shen Bao, and the two gentlemen who have recently presided over the affairs of the newspaper, Pan Gongzhan and Chen Xunjin, one is an old colleague of my late father, and the other is an outstanding figure in the newspaper industry. It is expected that the Shen Bao will be able to achieve even greater heights in the future. I am incapable and unable to carry on the legacy of my predecessors. In the midst of shame and bewilderment, I can only follow behind these gentlemen and wait to see their success!

### The Rebirth of the Shen Bao

The Japanese invaders' surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on "January 28th" broke the silence of the Pacific Ocean; the isolated Shanghai also sank with the waves of the Pacific Ocean. The opinions of the Shen Bao were originally regarded as a thorn in the side by the enemy and puppets. At this time, they wanted to use the seventy-year-old brand of the Shen Bao and forcibly ordered it to resume publication. Soon after, they sent the traitor Bin Jie to implement a forced takeover. From then on, this Shen Bao with a long history was controlled by the enemy and puppets and temporarily fell into a dark period.

The firecrackers of victory eliminated the black curtain that had been shrouded, and it returned to its former brightness. The Shen Bao also began its rebirth. The Shen Bao, which had been held by traitors for three years, was like a person suffering from all kinds of illnesses and needed to be properly treated and recuperated. The central government was particularly concerned about this historically important newspaper and appointed Central Committee member Pan Gongzhan as the instructor and chief editor, and Legislative Yuan member Chen Xunjin as the general manager and editor-in-chief, to carefully plan the reorganization. It was officially re-launched on November 22, 1945. In May 1946, the guidance period expired, and it was returned to the company. On May 15, a joint meeting of directors and supervisors decided to appoint Pan Gongzhan as president and editor-in-chief, and Chen Xunjin as general manager and editor-in-chief. Since its reorganization, the Shen Bao has taken on a new look, and its organization has become more sound.

After the Shen Bao resumed publication, the editorial department strived to enrich the content and made every effort to expand the news network. Local news was collected through a collective interview system, which was both economical in terms of manpower and time and achieved great results. Special correspondents, reporters, and correspondents were stationed in various cities, large and small, in other parts of the country. In foreign countries, major cities in Europe, America, Southeast Asia, and Japan also had reporters from this newspaper, who maintained close contact with the editorial department. Due to careful coordination, the layout of each edition became more substantial and vivid.

In addition to news, great attention was also paid to photographs and illustrations. There were several photojournalists in this city who took photos at any time for application. Correspondents and reporters in other places also often provided news photos for publication in various editions. In addition, the New York Times was specially contracted to provide foreign news photos to match international news. The publication of a large number of photographs made it easier for readers to understand the news, and the layout was particularly lively.

The archives were also greatly expanded. A large number of Chinese and Western books and magazines were added, old and new books and newspapers were sorted, and biographies and photographs of celebrities, as well as overviews of various institutions and societies, were collected for reference during editing.

After the Shen Bao resumed publication, the sales volume increased sharply, reaching as far as Suining, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Xikang. In order to facilitate readers in remote areas, a photo-offset edition was published, which was only two-fifths the size of the original edition, making it easy to send by air and reducing the burden on readers, while also being clear, beautiful, and more suitable for collection. Unfortunately, it was interrupted due to printing issues, but it is hoped that it will be restored soon.

Since July of last year, in order to promote the sale of domestic products, the Shen Bao, at the request of major manufacturers, has organized a joint grand giveaway, which has been held for five months. The number of participating manufacturers has increased from more than twenty to eighty, and the total value of the giveaways issued has reached 250 million yuan. Starting in August this year, manufacturers are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Shen Bao and the publication of its 25,000th issue by repeating the giveaway.

As mentioned earlier, the Shen Bao often received many photographs from various places. In addition to a small number of them being published in the newspaper, the majority could not be published due to space limitations. On New Year's Day this year, the Shen Bao held an exhibition of current affairs photographs in Hangzhou, which caused a sensation throughout the city of Hangzhou. Following this, exhibitions were held in Nanjing, Suzhou, Nantong, Fuzhou, Taiwan, Beiping, and other places. Each place was a grand occasion. Before the exhibition was held, Nanjing often had current affairs photographs displayed in its office, which were changed every week. The Hangzhou Youth Center also regularly exhibited them. Photographs are the most vivid and authentic records, and especially in China, where education is not yet widespread, they are more likely to attract audiences. These photo exhibitions of the Shen Bao have great educational significance. In addition, the West Lake Museum in Hangzhou requested a complete set of photographs from the Shen Bao regarding the convening of the National Assembly to preserve these meaningful historical documents. The Directorate General of Posts also requested photographs from the Shen Bao to serve as the basis for designing stamps. These two events further increased the value of current affairs photographs.

Using radio to broadcast news is also a new work created by the Shen Bao. Compared with European and American countries, the sales volume of newspapers in our country is very small, which is because there are too many people who cannot read the newspaper. After eight years of resistance against Japan, people are more concerned about national affairs than before, but other than occasionally hearing a little bit, they cannot obtain it. In addition to its existing readers, the Shen Bao seeks to enable more people to acquire current affairs knowledge. Starting on March 17, it cooperated with 18 private and public radio stations in the city to broadcast news three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, which has been well received by all sectors of society. Especially the news of the National Army's attack on Yan'an. The Ministry of National Defense received a phone call from Xi'an at 4:30 that afternoon, while Shanghai radio stations broadcast the news from the Shen Bao at 6:00.

The Shen Bao's use of radio to broadcast news expands the scope of the newspaper from a plane to a three-dimensional space, which is a great achievement. It then held a special all-day broadcast on Sundays, which was held in rotation on various radio stations. The content included weekly current affairs reviews, celebrity speeches, local correspondence, science lectures, social services, and other items, with the main goal of spreading culture, combined with noble music and entertainment programs to promote proper entertainment.

In addition to its own business, the Shen Bao also attaches great importance to social undertakings. In the past, it has organized many social undertakings with great success. After the resumption of publication, the work of social service continues. In addition to the medical and legal advisors who are regularly published in the newspaper, it has successively organized midwifery campaigns, tuberculosis X-ray examinations, relief funds for the orphaned, widowed, poor, and sick, and fundraising for the bereaved families of martyred journalists. Recently, it has also organized a scholarship campaign with a target of one billion yuan. Donations have been pouring in in recent days, but the number of students who have applied is very large. The target of one billion yuan is still not enough to distribute to everyone.

Seventy years is a rare age in life, but from the perspective of a career, seventy-five years is only a small part of the entire career. The Shen Bao is the elder brother in the Chinese newspaper industry, but its spirit has not aged. Especially after the resumption of publication, it has become young again, regained its youth, is full of vigorous vitality, and is working hard to advance its career.

### Popularized News

Although the writing of the Shen Bao in the early years did not cite classics, it was profound and elegant, and not everyone could fully understand it. Fortunately, the people who read the newspaper at that time were "all literate," and the editors prided themselves on their writing and elegance. It seemed that they were not concerned at all about the fact that many people could not understand the difficult language. However, the Shen Bao had long recognized that newspapers were a powerful tool for promoting culture. Therefore, in addition to this newspaper, it also published two more popular news publications: "Min Bao" and Illustrated News.

"Min Bao" was founded on the fifth day of the third lunar month of the second year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. It was published every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The news was written in vernacular Chinese, which ordinary literate people could understand. Its publication announcement stated: "This newspaper is specially set up for the people, so the sentences are like ordinary speech, and each sentence, as well as the names of people and places, are clearly marked, so that even those who are slightly literate can easily understand." This newspaper can be regarded as the ancestor of vernacular newspapers.

On March 31, 1936, the "Sixty Years Ago" column of the North China Daily News contained a passage about Min Bao. It stated, in brief: "We see that the Min Bao published by the Shen Bao is indeed a new type of newspaper. Its characteristic is that it is written in popular language, so readers can easily understand its content. At the end of each sentence, there is a space, and the people and places are marked with straight lines and dashed lines on the side. Anyone who has read two years of school can read it. Therefore, it can penetrate the stage that the Shen Bao cannot reach, such as shop assistants and laborers."

Pictures are news without words, which is easier to understand than newspapers in vernacular Chinese. Since 1930, the Shen Bao has issued an illustrated supplement, which is attached to the newspaper and has been well received. However, the earliest illustrated publications of the Shen Bao date back to the early years of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. In August of the third year of Guangxu, the "Yinghuan Pictorial" was founded, which published illustrated descriptions of world affairs and customs. It was an irregular publication, with more than ten pages per issue. The illustrations were drawn by famous British artists, and Cai Erkang added explanations. A total of five volumes were published. Starting in April of the tenth year of Guangxu, another pictorial was published, which was issued every ten days, with eight pictures in each issue, all of which were amazing and memorable events in the news. Because it was printed by Dianshizhai, it was named Dianshizhai Pictorial.

Sixty years later, education in our country is still not widespread, and there are still many illiterate people. Although the writing in newspapers has become very popular, there are still many people who cannot understand the newspaper. In recent times, the evolution of society, especially after eight years of resistance against Japan, has made many people eager to know about domestic and foreign affairs. Therefore, in the current situation, newspapers with popular writing and news reported with illustrations are still very much needed, and Zhong Bao can take on this responsibility.

### Literary Inquisition

The responsibility of a newspaper lies in reporting news and promoting public opinion. In the late Qing Dynasty, when politics was not well-managed, criticism of public opinion was regarded as a thorn in the side. Therefore, the news of various government offices was strictly sealed off, and it was not easy to interview news involving military finance. There were even cases of literary inquisition caused by this.

At the turn of Guangxu and Xuantong, the number of newspapers gradually increased, and news competition was fierce. Beiping was the political source at that time, and all parties focused their attention on it. Therefore, all newspapers recruited personnel to interview news. At that time, the correspondent of this newspaper was Zhong Shenshu. Zhong worked in the Grand Council, and although his position was not very high, he could see one or two of the confidential affairs of the court. Therefore, as a secretary of the Imperial Chancellery, he won the title of "Little Grand Councilor," but the great prison also arose from this.

Zhong was very diligent in his duties. Since being hired by this newspaper, he sent a letter every day to report the news. Although only a glimpse of the inner workings was dared to be fully declared, the rare and secret news was enough to add color to this newspaper. One day, he suddenly received a private telegram stating that Zhong had been arrested for leaking secrets. His colleagues were extremely shocked, but there was no way to send a telegram to inquire about his safety. Tao, a driver at the telegraph bureau, was also arrested at the same time. Another person, Lei, was also implicated. Fortunately, he heard the news in Tianjin and hid in advance. Although he was not arrested, he suffered from neurasthenia due to shock. Zhong and Tao were initially sentenced to capital punishment, but fortunately, influential people interceded for them, and they were leniently sentenced to exile in Xinjiang. Zhong had a high reputation for talent and extensive social connections. Later, someone interceded for him, and he was released and returned after two years in Manchuria. Tao was not freed until the restoration. This great prison ended in this way, which was fortunate.

Zhong was honest and trustworthy and cautious in his work. The editors of this newspaper also carefully considered the news provided by Zhong before publishing it, thinking that he would not be imprisoned. However, the reason for this turmoil has always been unclear. It was only after someone talked about it that the inside story of this case was known to be an international conspiracy. At that time, Tsarist Russia was plotting to swallow up our country's northeast, so it used various methods to probe our country's secrets and formed a large-scale spy network. Tao and others were used by them, and Zhong was also implicated, which led to his imprisonment. It was not a real literary inquisition.

### The Best-Selling Day

The sales volume of this newspaper has increased with the age of this newspaper, from hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands. But compared with European and American newspapers, which sell millions of copies a day, we are far behind.

In normal times, the sales volume of newspapers is always stable at a fixed number, and although there are slight differences, the number is very small. On Sundays, it is usually a little more, and on New Year's Day, National Day, and other commemorative days, the sales volume will also increase. Otherwise, there must have been a particularly major accident. I remember on the evening of August 11, 1945, Japan surrendered. The next day, all the newspapers in several major cities in the rear were snatched up. If you were late, you would not be able to buy them.

In the past, important domestic and foreign news did not arouse the interest of many people. What they were most concerned about at that time was the publication of the list of successful candidates in the provincial and metropolitan examinations. Those who participated in the examination, of course, wanted to know the results of the examination as soon as possible; the fathers and brothers were also very concerned about the fame of their younger brothers; even relatives and friends, as well as people from the same village, felt that knowing the people on the list was a very honorable thing. Therefore, the grand occasion on the day of the publication of the list of successful candidates in the provincial and metropolitan examinations was perhaps similar to the day of the announcement of the US presidential election. Originally, in the era of the imperial examination system, the so-called great Dengke was a major event in life.

The publication of the list of successful candidates in the provincial and metropolitan examinations was originally posted in front of the Ministry of Rites or the Academy. At that time, there were many people who specialized in the work of reporting the news, and they would report the people who had been admitted on the list to their families, relatives, and teachers in the fastest way, which could earn them a lot of rewards. Fortunately, this was a great happy event, and they were happy to spend a few taels of silver more.

After the publication of this newspaper, on the date of the publication of the list of successful candidates in the metropolitan examination or the provincial examinations in the provinces of Jiangnan, the list of admitted names was disclosed in the newspaper. Therefore, many people who were directly or indirectly related to the examination learned to buy it, and the sales volume on this day was particularly high, and the price was temporarily raised. At that time, although the sales volume of the Shen Bao was mostly in the Jiangnan area, the literary style in Jiangnan was always strong, and there were many people who were concerned about the publication of the list of successful candidates in the imperial examination. Therefore, this day became the best-selling day for the newspaper. This number is still very small compared to the current sales volume, but at that time, it was indeed very large.

### Zun Wen Ge (Respect News Pavilion)

In the interview room on the third floor of the Shen Bao, there is a plaque with the three characters "Zun Wen Ge (尊聞閣)," meaning "Respect News Pavilion". According to the date inscribed, it was written in the eighth year of Guangxu, which is sixty-five years ago. When this plaque was inscribed, only Mr. Dai Yunqing, who is now an old colleague of the newspaper, had been born, but he was still at the stage of learning to walk! Its historical relationship with this newspaper can indeed be said to be not short.

The three characters "Zun Wen Ge" were written by Mr. Wu Jutan of Qiantang and were inscribed for the building of the Shen Bao. In the past, halls and study rooms often had inscriptions, especially literati, who liked to inscribe some elegant plaques. The Shen Bao is a place where literati and refined scholars spend their days and nights together, so it is naturally impossible to avoid customs. The three characters "Zun Wen Ge" contain the meaning of "respecting the news industry."

From the three characters "Zun Wen Ge," one cannot help but think of the building of this newspaper. At first, this newspaper was opposite the Hong Church on Hankou Road, which is now the site of the municipal government. It was an old-fashioned two-story building with a small room and a dim light all night long. Compared with today's tall buildings and magnificent structures, the distance cannot be measured. These three humble houses were the place where the early colleagues of the Shen Bao lived and rested, and the plaque of "Zun Wen" should have been hung there.

During the Xuantong reign, business became increasingly prosperous, and the old house was not enough to use. Therefore, it was moved to 263 Wangping Street. The three-story building there, although still a very old Western-style house, was much more spacious and brighter than before. This was the second home of the Shen Bao.

In 1913, after Mr. Shi Liangcai took over, he planned to build a new building to ensure permanence. As a result, he chose the corner of Hankou Road and Shandong Road, designed and drew the drawings, and built it. In 1918, the new building was completed, which is today's building. This new five-story steel and concrete building is magnificent in appearance and bright and spacious inside. In October of that year, the third relocation was made. The cost of this new building at that time was more than 700,000 taels of silver. However, due to the European War, the source of cement and steel was scarce, and the price was extremely high. The construction company suffered a loss of 100,000 yuan. Later, when Mr. Shi Liangcai learned about it, he generously donated another 50,000 yuan in addition to the construction cost to compensate for the company's losses.

Building its own building was initiated by the Shen Bao. At that time, building such a building could show the power and enthusiasm of the host for running the newspaper. Although many people sourly criticized it for being a waste, the industry was envious of it, especially the clean and hygienic toilets, which were "coveted" by the editors of various newspapers. At that time, Mr. Bao Tianxiao wrote novels for the Free Talk, so he had the right to enjoy these toilets. Many editors of other newspapers who knew Mr. Bao also took the opportunity to secretly solve the "convenience" problem, and the Shen Bao opened the door to convenience.

Ten years later, this five-story building felt insufficient again. Therefore, in 1930, a new building was added to the south of the old building. The height and style were the same as the old building, forming a U-shape. Last year, another floor was added to the platform of the new building, so now the front half is still five stories, while the back half is six stories.

### Foremen and Secretaries

When the *Shen Bao* newspaper was first established, the editorial department was headed by Jiang Zhixiang, with He Guisheng and Qian Xinbo assisting in the editing duties. Later, Jiang Zhixiang succeeded in the imperial examinations and naturally no longer wanted to engage in the work of a frustrated intellectual. (People at that time all viewed the newspaper business in this way.) Thus, He Guisheng was invited to take charge, followed by Qian Xinbo and Huang Shiquan. In terms of accounting, the chief accountant was initially Zhao Yiru, followed by Xi Zimei. After Xi Zimei passed away, his disciple Pei Gang took over. This was the lineup of the *Shen Bao* at that time. Although it was just starting out, the key players were quite well-rounded.

The terms "foreman" and "secretary" are rarely heard now. However, in the *Shen Bao* of that time, under the management of foreigners, the people in the accounting and editorial departments were referred to as "foremen" and "secretaries."

Although they were honored with the titles of "foreman" or "secretary," their lives were very meager. At that time, the highest salary was only forty yuan, with the rest decreasing accordingly, and the lowest was only a little over ten yuan. Food, laundry, haircuts, and the cost of writing materials were all taken from this amount. Although the cost of living was still low at that time, it was still felt to be very difficult to make ends meet. It is said that He Guisheng's monthly salary was thirty yuan, and he loved buying books all his life, so half of his money was always spent on buying books, so he often found himself penniless. He had no choice but to go to the willow-lined pavilion alone every day, brew a pot of tea, and buy a few sesame cakes to satisfy his hunger, which could be compared to General Feng Huanzhang's life of eating large flatbreads and fried dough sticks.

At that time, not only were newspaper employees poorly paid, but also the place where they worked was very simple. Lei Zeng, an old reporter of this newspaper, once described the early situation of this newspaper, saying: "At that time, the *Shen Bao*'s buildings were very dilapidated. Only the office of the foreigners was spacious, clean, and tidy. As for the place where we resided and worked, it was no more than a few feet square, the light was dark, and eating, sleeping, and relieving oneself were all done in it. In winter, the cold wind was bone-chilling, and in summer, it was as hot as a furnace. The most unbearable thing was the large number of bedbugs breeding everywhere, which was very surprising. Often, one was disturbed all night and could not sleep." After reading these few sentences, one can also imagine the difficult living conditions of newspaper employees in those years.

### A Brief History of This Newspaper

When this newspaper was compiling "The Most Recent Fifty Years," the editors said something like this:

"Shall we commemorate fifty years? Then the person must be at least fifty years old to be qualified as an editor. And within twenty years of age, it is the year of life for seeking knowledge, even if there are hearings, it is still not dare to believe whether it is enough for writing materials. Then the editor of the 50th anniversary book must be at least 70 years old. And someday, when compiling the 100th anniversary book, how can we get some centenarians to spread their old pens!"

This year is the 75th anniversary of this newspaper. As the editor of "The Most Recent Fifty Years" predicted, it is a pity that there is no centenarian to write this brief history for him. What is written now can only follow the old example of historians, and everything that cannot be seen or heard is relegated to the category of "hearsay."

According to Mr. Zhang Yunhe (Mo) in his article "The *Shen Bao* in the Past Sixty Years," the ancient history of the *Shen Bao* is:

"At the end of the Tongzhi reign of the former Qing Dynasty, an Englishman named Ernest Major established a company in Shanghai, and the *Shen Bao* was one of its businesses. At that time, there were no newspapers in Shanghai, and Major was the first to establish one. From our perspective today, we must think that he had some ambition, or wanted to manipulate public opinion, or wanted to invade culture. However, Major at that time did not have such a profound meaning. He simply regarded it as a type of business and facilitated his commercial publicity. Therefore, after its establishment, everything was entrusted to Chinese managers, and the first person to write the articles was Jiang Zhixiang."

This was the beginning of the publication of the *Shen Bao*. It was actually on the 23rd day of the third month of the Ren Shen year of the Tongzhi reign of the former Qing Dynasty, which is April 30, 1872, in the Western calendar. At that time, there was more than one founder. Mr. Hu Daojing said in the history of the 66th anniversary of the *Shen Bao*:

"The *Shen Bao* was jointly established by Englishman Major and his friends C. Woodward, W.B. Pryer, and John Wachillop. Each person contributed four hundred taels of silver as capital. On May 19, 1871, which is the first day of the fourth month of the tenth year of the former Qing Dynasty, a contract was signed to establish a Chinese-language daily newspaper."

According to Mr. Lei Yao (Guan) in his article "The Past Conditions of the *Shen Bao* Newspaper," the people in the newspaper were:

"The location of the newspaper was east of Hankou Road in the British Concession. It is said that the first Chinese manager was a Mr. Zhao from Zhejiang, so the chief writers he hired, such as He Guisheng and Qian Xinbo, were all from Zhejiang."

The so-called Zhao from Zhejiang refers to Mr. Zhao Yiru. Mr. Huang Shiquan (Xie Xun) said in his article "The Experience of the Early Days of This Newspaper":

"The chief writers in the newspaper were successively Mr. Jiang Zhixiang, Mr. Qian Xinbo. After Xinbo resigned, I took over his position. The person in charge of translation was Mr. Bi Linna (H.A. pereira), assisted by Mr. Dong Yunsun. The person in charge of accounting was Mr. Zhao Yiru and Mr. Xi Zimei. After Zimei died, his disciple Pei Ji took over. This was the situation when the Westerners were the owners of the newspaper."

However, Major soon had no intention of operating the newspaper anymore. Mr. Huang said:

"At that time, the sales volume of the *Shen Bao* became more and more prosperous. Major happily said: My energy has been exhausted, and my reputation has been promoted. With the profits I have gained from the *Shen Bao*, I have added the Dianshizhai Stone Lithography Bureau, the Tushu Jicheng Letterpress Printing Bureau, the Suichang Match Factory, and the Jiangsu Medicinal Water Factory, and all have successively achieved success. It is time to retire gracefully, so I changed the *Shen Bao* Newspaper into a company, and then sailed back to my home country."

After Major left, there was still a small transitional period. Mr. Lei said:

"In the Ding You year of Guangxu twenty-three (1897), Major returned to his country after making a profit. The head of the company was Englishman E.O. Abuthnot, and the translator was Portuguese Bi Linna. The Chinese manager was still Mr. Xi Zimei, and the chief writer was Mr. Huang Shiquan. The overall power of the entire newspaper was controlled by the English head. However, the head was not familiar with the Chinese language, and when there were matters to be discussed, they were all translated by Bi Linna. Mr. Bi was the key to communicating between China and the West and connecting the upper and lower levels."

The recovery of this newspaper and its management by the Chinese was actually on the 13th day of the fourth month of the first year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, which is May 31, 1909, in the Western calendar. It had been 37 years since Major founded it. Mr. Zhang recorded the process:

"Mr. Jin Jianhua from Qingpu and Mr. Lei Yao from Songjiang catered to the new trend and succeeded Mr. Huang Shiquan as the head of the writing department. Also, because the head of the company, although he was isolated from the Chinese political situation and did not interfere much, it was very dangerous for a country's public opinion organ to be controlled by foreigners and not be free and independent. Therefore, they strongly urged the Chinese manager, Mr. Xi Zipei, to negotiate with the Westerners to recover the newspaper. The head of the company discussed it with the directors and agreed to transfer all the assets of the *Shen Bao* Newspaper to the Chinese for a price of 75,000 yuan, and Mr. Xi signed the contract with them. From this point on, the *Shen Bao* was completely in the hands of our Chinese people."

Soon after, Mr. Jin and Mr. Lei also left the newspaper, and Mr. Zhang became the head of the writing department. Not long after, the revolution was successful. In the early years of the Republic of China, the first major event in this newspaper was the takeover by Mr. Shi Liangcai. Mr. Zhang recorded the process:

"After the establishment of the Republic of China, the whole country was full of the atmosphere of innovation, and the people were happily looking forward to the boundless development of the future. The *Shen Bao* was also at this time changed hands. Mr. Shi Liangcai entered the newspaper as the general manager and hired Mr. Chen Jinghan (Leng) as the chief writer. After Mr. Shi entered the newspaper, he planned all administrative affairs and recruited several people who were committed to doing things to help him, and gradually expanded the newspaper's affairs. Mr. Chen gradually reorganized the editorial department. Therefore, at this time, the *Shen Bao* was even more prosperous and developing upwards in great strides."

Mr. Hu also said:

"In 1912, the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Xi Zipei sold the *Shen Bao* Newspaper to Mr. Shi Liangcai. The contract was signed on September 23 of the same year, and the handover was on October 20. Mr. Shi took the position of general manager himself, adopted new methods, and used new people. The business increased even more, and he became the leader of the Shanghai newspaper industry."

The general management office of this newspaper was established in January of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932) as the highest authority in charge of the entire newspaper. The internal organization was completely new. Unfortunately, Mr. Shi was killed on the Shanghai-Hangzhou road on October 6 of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). The newspaper lost the figure who presided over the overall plan, so the board of directors was organized to replace the authority of the general manager. After another three years, the July 7th Incident occurred. Mr. Hu said:

"If there is something to say, it is long. If there is nothing to say, it is short. Speaking of July 7, 1937, our country launched a full-scale war of resistance against the violent Japanese. On August 13, the war in the eastern battlefield began. Our army fought in Shanghai for three months and withdrew the entire army according to the predetermined strategy, luring the enemy to go deep. Except for the concessions, the entire city of Shanghai fell into the hands of the Japanese. At this time, the Japanese army was arrogant and jealous of the Chinese newspapers still publishing in the concessions, so they organized a puppet news censorship office and notified the Chinese newspapers to send the newspaper samples for inspection from December 15 of that year. They also notified the concession authorities that the Chinese newspapers that did not send the inspection would be closed. The newspapers were angered by righteousness and would rather die than surrender. Either before or at the time limit, they all automatically announced a temporary suspension of publication. The *Shen Bao* was published on December 14, 1937, and stopped publishing after the 23,208th issue. On December 14, the *Shen Bao* published a clear announcement: "Due to environmental reasons, the publication will be suspended from December 15. This is a notice for public review."

"When the war was going on in Shanghai, the *Shen Bao* had moved part of its printing machinery to Hankou, preparing for the *Shen Bao* to be published in Hankou to continue its mission of encouraging the national spirit. The *Shen Bao*, which had been published for 65 years, stopped publishing in Shanghai. The Hankou edition was actively promoted and published until January 15, 1938. On March 1 of the same year, the Hong Kong edition was issued in Hong Kong, and the two places were published at the same time.

"From August 1, 1938, the Hankou edition of the *Shen Bao* ceased publication. The machines were moved to Guilin, intending to be published in Guilin, but it was not realized. At this time, the resumption of the Shanghai newspaper had begun.

After Shanghai fell, the Chinese newspapers run by British and American businessmen in the concessions still adhered to justice and tried their best to report accurate news and encourage the spirit of the Chinese people. The Japanese were not satisfied with this third country's industry that upheld justice, but they could not infringe on it. The Shanghai *Shen Bao* was then contracted by the American Columbia Publishing Company. It was republished on October 10, 1938. Shanghai and Hong Kong were published at the same time."

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, this newspaper has been in a dark age. It was not until the 34th year of the Republic (1945) that it was able to see the light of day again and reorganize. The resumption of publication on December 22 said:

"The *Shen Bao* has done some small work for China's press, cultural circles, and even the general public in the past. Except for the temporary suspension of publication in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) due to the withdrawal of the national army to the west, there has never been a suspension of publication in its publication record. However, since the Pacific War, the *Shen Bao* has been kidnapped by the enemy and puppets, and its actions have lost freedom. Although the *Shen Bao* is still published after that, it is not an expression of the *Shen Bao*'s free will, and it is invalid in law and in principle. Therefore, the *Shen Bao* is republished today, and its issue number is based on December 8, 1941 of the Republic of China." "In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the national army withdrew to the west and the Shanghai concessions were still preserved, we not only relied on American businessmen to avoid being subdued by the enemy, but also published in Hankou and Hong Kong one after another. In the meantime, Jin Huating, a reporter for the *Shen Bao*, was assassinated by the enemy and puppets. Other colleagues, either were subjected to coercion and refused to surrender, or suffered hardships but did not change their integrity, all of which are enough for our *Shen Bao* to always retain righteousness."

The resumption of publication was the 24,338th issue, and today is exactly the 25,000th issue. From the 11th year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty to today, it has been 75 years. When this newspaper entered the 10,000th issue, it was still on February 14 of the 27th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. The topic of the commentary on that day was "The First Issue of This Newspaper," which said:

"It is hoped that China will learn from the past and strive to reform, promote all benefits, and eliminate all waste."

In the 11th year of the Republic of China, this newspaper published a commemorative book "The Most Recent Fifty Years" on the 50th anniversary. Chen Jinghan wrote an article "A Review of the Reporter's Life in the Past Twenty Years," which contained several sentences:

"In the first ten years, I had only one thought about newspapers. I often thought to myself: What must I do so that people will read my newspaper? In the next ten years, I had another thought about newspapers: What must I do so that people will benefit from reading my newspaper?"

In his article "The *Shen Bao* in the Past Sixty Years," Mr. Zhang quoted this sentence and said: "It is a famous saying and a great truth, not only for the colleagues who are commemorating the 60th anniversary today, but also for the press in the future 600 years and 6000 years, it will not be changed."

The publication of the 20,000th issue was on November 19, 1928. Mr. Chen also said:

"The *Shen Bao* is the epitome of history, and the *Shen Bao* is a history museum. Although it is an overstatement, I hope that from the 20,000th issue, it will gradually reach 100,000 and 1 million issues, and it will always serve the public and advance to become a world history view."

On July 21, 1932, this newspaper created the *Shen Bao* Monthly to commemorate the 60th anniversary. In the inaugural speech, we said in our mission:

"We must fulfill the mission of culture and economy, take the increase of public happiness as a prerequisite, and move forward to reach the bright and prosperous avenue."

Finally, we still quote a few words from the resumption of publication speech:

"The construction of a democratic country should be based on fair public opinion. The *Shen Bao*'s resumption of publication has no lofty ideals, but it is willing to make faithful reports of news for readers. When publishing an event or making a statement, it must be carefully considered whether it is beneficial to the people and the public, and whether it is beneficial to the overall situation of the country and the world."

### Original Report of This Newspaper

The modern Chinese newspaper industry was started by foreign merchants, and the *Shen Bao* was born under these circumstances. On May 19, 1871, the Englishman Ernest Major, along with his friends Woodhead, Palamede, and Varchiro, signed a contract to found a Chinese-language newspaper—namely, the *Shen Bao*. However, the inaugural issue of the *Shen Bao* was actually on April 30 of the following year, and this year marks its 75th anniversary. After Major founded the *Shen Bao*, it was not until 1909 that it was taken back by Chinese people and run independently. Therefore, for one-third of its 75 years, it grew up under the management of foreign merchants. When writing the history of the *Shen Bao* today, this earliest period cannot be omitted.

When this newspaper was first published, it was at a time when domestic wars were gradually ceasing. At the same time, the pressure from foreign forces was not yet strongly felt. The people, having finally caught their breath, believed that they could live in peace from then on. Those in official circles were still busy running around and scheming, seeking wealth and status. The general scholars were engaged in writing stereotyped essays, obsessed with the path of the imperial examination. The *Shen Bao*, in this environment of superficial peace, also took this as its guideline for editing and selecting materials. At that time, the content of the *Shen Bao* included imperial edicts, Beijing gazettes, and palace gate transcripts, reporting news from official circles. It also included examination questions for various levels of exams, for the reference of scholars. In addition, there were poems and songs, which were works of famous scholars who, inspired by the moment, composed verses about the wind and the moon. The so-called "news" was actually fire alerts, murder cases, strange stories, and odd events from various places, which were only suitable for people's after-dinner conversation. The more decent part was an essay, equivalent to the current editorial, but the subject matter was not related to current affairs, and the writing was extremely pedantic. Even so, it was still inevitably denounced as reactionary! At that time, the sources of news domestically were only a few major cities that had reporters stationed, while foreign news was all translated or reprinted from Hong Kong newspapers. At the same time, due to inconvenient transportation, the date of an event occurring was at least a week or ten days away from the date it was published in the newspaper. For distant places, it was even more than a month. This kind of record had already lost its news value. Fortunately, most of what was published was social news, so the timeliness was less important. At the same time, readers' mentality was to treat them as fictional stories.

At that time, the *Shen Bao* was not only very empty in content but also extremely rigid in form. A large sheet of *maotai* paper was printed on one side. The whole sheet was divided into eight sections, each section being about 20 centimeters high, and a little space was left between the two sections for folding. The text was all printed in No. 4 lead type, and the headlines were also the same, while advertisements were changed to No. 5 type. Except for the headlines of essays and important texts, which were listed on a separate line, ordinary news headlines were only separated from the main text by one space. Such a newspaper looked very much like a remnant leaf from a woodblock book, antique and fragrant, making people "feel nostalgic for the past." But under the conditions at the time, it was already very difficult to achieve this.

When the *Shen Bao* was first published, it came out every other day. From the fifth issue (May 7, 1872), it was changed to daily publication, but Sunday was suspended. It wasn't until April 27, 1879, that the newspaper was also published as usual on Sundays.

The year 1881 was a new turning point in the history of Chinese transportation. On December 24 of that year, the telegraph line between Shanghai and Tianjin was completed. At that time, people thought that being able to transmit books and letters from a long distance of three thousand *li* through telegraph lines was an unprecedented miracle. At the same time, people's concept of time was still very weak at that time. Unless there was a very urgent matter, they would not bother with this new tool. Before the telegraph was connected, Major notified the Tianjin reporter that in the future, decrees of the Qing court could be transmitted by telegraph. From then on, the Beijing gazette, which could only be received every six or seven days, could be received on the same day and published in the newspaper the next day. This was the first time that the Chinese press used telegraph to transmit news. Three years later, the telegraph lines between Beijing and Tianjin were also established. At that time, major events in the imperial court were sometimes also transmitted by telegraph. Thus, news gradually appeared in a truly "new" form.

Two years after the publication of the *Shen Bao*, Japan used the pretext of the murder of Taiwanese aborigines to send troops to attack the aboriginal communities. This was good news material, so Major personally went out to investigate the news and collected historical facts and local customs about Taiwan and coordinated them with the news, publishing them together in the newspaper. At that time, most readers mainly focused on entertainment, and people in official circles might pay a little attention to political news, but it was also very limited. Since Major used this novel material, it greatly aroused readers' interest, and sales increased sharply.

In 1884, French troops invaded Vietnam. Major, considering that the news of the Japanese attack on Taiwan in the past was very popular with readers, decided to make great use of this Sino-French War. So he hired a Russian as a reporter to interview news in the French military camp and transmitted it by telegraph from Hong Kong to Xiamen to Shanghai. The following year, when French warships attacked Ningbo, the *Shen Bao* still sent Russians there. At that time, China's war was unfavorable, but other newspapers were deeply silent. Only the *Shen Bao* reported accurate news. At first, many people thought that the *Shen Bao* was biased towards France, but later it was proved that the *Shen Bao*'s news was correct, and sales increased greatly. At the same time, advertising customers came in droves, and the original space could no longer accommodate them, so only additional pages could be added.

When the *Shen Bao* was first published, it was at a time of great change in China. This opportunity could be used, but it was also the most difficult to deal with. The *Shen Bao* was published in an environment of lack of materials and simple equipment, and there were few readers. It happened to encounter two wars, and the *Shen Bao* seized the opportunity and laid the foundation. With the increase in sales, the paper also gradually improved. The original *Shen Bao* was printed on *maotai* paper. After publishing the truth about the Japanese attack on Taiwan, sales increased to several thousand, and *maotai* paper was no longer applicable. From September 11, 1874, it was changed to printing on seralian paper. By 1884, due to the Sino-French War, sales increased again, and it was necessary to abandon the handmade seralian paper and switch to machine-made glossy paper. The Opium War opened the door to China, but most people, except for those with clear minds, were still not awake. By the time of the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, people's hearts were shocked; the Reform Movement of 1898, with the massacre of partisans, shocked people's hearts again; the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, with the Eight-Nation Alliance entering Beijing, shocked people's hearts again. After three stimulations, the people were like waking up from a big dream, and they realized the faintness of the court and the corruption of politics. They realized the trend of the world's currents. New ideas and new insights came one after another, and many newspapers followed this path. At that time, Jin Jianhua and Lei Junyao, who assisted the *Shen Bao* in writing, had very novel ideas and tried their best to cater to the trend and planned reform measures. This was thirty-four years away from the initial publication, exactly half of the seventy-five years.

In January 1905, at the end of the 30th year of Guangxu, the cadres of the whole newspaper office discussed for two days and two nights before deciding on the reform plan. From February 7, they met the readers with a new posture. The new look of this newspaper, in terms of form, expanded the space to two pages, front and back, arranged in two columns, and used larger typefaces for the headlines to make them eye-catching. In terms of content, news was valued, and correspondents were hired in major cities and towns in various provinces to collect news, especially about transportation, commerce, and entertainment, which was more detailed. In European and Western countries, reporters were also recruited to inquire about international situations. At the same time, for important news, all places where telegraphs were available were transmitted by telegraph so that readers could see it quickly. In terms of editorials, in order to meet the needs of the times, in addition to the regular writing of the main writer, if there were insightful current affairs essays from the outside world, they were also selectively published to gather opinions and expand benefits. At the same time, texts from various Western newspapers were translated for reference.

The sudden change in the tone of the *Shen Bao*, which had always been considered old and heavy, surprised everyone. At that time, the ideas of society were divided into two factions, one advocating reform and the other advocating conservatism. The reform of the *Shen Bao* caused the ideas of the two factions to converge. Conservatives, seeing that the attitude of the *Shen Bao* had also changed, felt that the general trend was that reform and self-strengthening were necessary. And reformers, believing that the *Shen Bao*'s arguments also expressed sympathy for them, further enhanced their new strength. Indeed, that reform of the *Shen Bao* made many people look at each other in surprise.

Major founded the *Shen Bao* purely for profit, so all editorial matters were completely handed over to the Chinese to handle. The earliest chief writer was Mr. Jiang Xiangzhi, and the successors were Mr. He Guisheng, Mr. Qian Tingbo, and Mr. Huang Shiquan. The people who acted as editors were successively Cai Chongjiu, Cai Zhifo, Yao Zhujun, Zhang Xiaoxuan, Qian Minglue, Lai Huisheng, Liu Hebo, Jin Jianhua, Lei Junyao, Zhao Menglin, Pan Zhengqing, Huang Xiansheng, and Shen Yinjie. Only the Portuguese Bili Na presided over the translation affairs. On the management side, the first was Mr. Zhao Yiru. After Mr. Zhao passed away, Mr. Xi Zimei was invited. After Zimei died, his disciple Pei took over.

The businesses run by Major in Shanghai, in addition to the newspaper, included the Suichang Match Factory, the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory, the Tushu Jicheng Printing Bureau, and the Dianshizhai Printing Bureau. Even the newspaper office itself, in addition to publishing the newspaper every day, also engaged in publishing as a side business. (1) Editing and printing comprehensive monthly magazines, such as "Yinghuan Suoji," "Siming Suoji," and "Huanyu Suoji," specializing in publishing essays, novels, poems, and lyrics. (2) Editing and printing the popular "Min Bao," specially for women, children, business people, and people who could not understand high-level texts to read. (3) Editing and printing "Yinghuan Pictorial," selecting interesting world events and customs, drawing them into pictures, and briefly adding explanations, which was the originator of Chinese pictorials. Because it was printed by Dianshizhai, it was called Dianshizhai Pictorial. (5) Using movable lead type to print pocket-sized series of books, which pioneered the trend. More than 100 kinds were printed successively, including reprints of old ones and publications of new ones, among which there were quite valuable materials. At the same time, the meticulous proofreading and clear printing can also be compared with the Qing Dynasty Wuyingdian edition, known as the *Shen Bao* Juzhen edition. Some of them were also published by the Tushu Jicheng Printing Bureau.

In 1889, Major suddenly had the idea of returning home. So he reorganized the businesses he operated into Major Limited, including the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory, the Suichang Automatic Fire Factory, the *Shen Bao* Newspaper Office, the Shenchang Bookstore, and the *Shen Bao* Newspaper Office's buildings and land. The assets were estimated to be 300,000 taels, divided into 6,000 shares. Major recovered the original capital, converted it into 2,000 shares, and sailed back home. The company affairs were changed to be handled by directors Abornot, McBain, Mackenzie, Liang Jinzhi, and manager Finlin. At that time, Chinese people had obtained part of the shares of Major Company, so Mr. Liang was also listed as one of the four directors.

In 1909, the directors of Major Company planned to sell the *Shen Bao* to expand the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory. Manager Xi Zipei then took over the *Shen Bao* at a price of 75,000 yuan. From then on, this most historic opinion organ completely belonged to the Chinese people. At this time, it was 37 years since Major founded the company, and the era of foreign merchants in the newspaper office came to an end.

### Mr. Shi Liangcai's Career

If the era of Major is regarded as the founding period of the *Shen Bao*, then Mr. Shi Liangcai's management is the period of improvement and expansion of the *Shen Bao*. The reason why the *Shen Bao* was able to become a large enterprise and occupy an important page in the history of Chinese journalism is all due to Mr. Shi's efforts.

In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Shi Liangcai took over the *Shen Bao* for a price of 120,000 yuan, serving as the general manager. He invited Mr. Chen Jinghan as the chief writer and Mr. Zhang Zhuping as the manager, adopting new methods, recruiting new people, reforming the layout, and enriching the content. The atmosphere was completely new. Business was booming, and it began to move towards the path of development.

When the revolution was first completed and the republic was founded, a new atmosphere filled the whole country. The people had infinite expectations for the future of the country and the nation. Soon, the European War broke out, and there was a desire to know about the current situation of the new world and China's position in the international arena. Then, the May Fourth Movement occurred, and the need for new culture and new knowledge among young students became even more urgent. The *Shen Bao* also followed the trend of the times, catered to the needs of readers, and made improvements. In addition to editorials and news, it also set up various columns.

From August 31, 1919, the "Weekly Supplement" was created, which translated essays and important news from foreign newspapers and magazines, and systematically introduced international affairs to supplement the daily international news. From June 1, 1920, the "Common Sense Supplement" was added, with content including economics, health, science, municipal administration, customs, etc., to instill in the people the ordinary knowledge they should have, and to work harder to promote the Three Principles of the People. From February 8, 1924, the "Local Supplement" was republished, dedicated to serving all sectors of the local community, publishing the activities of various social undertakings in Shanghai, and advertisements for theaters and shops.

The earliest special issue was the "Automobile Supplement", which began on November 27, 1921, publishing news about highway construction and articles about the use of automobiles. "Education and Life" began on December 8, 1924, and was evolved from the "Education and Life" weekly magazine published in 1923, discussing ways to improve education. In 1925, a new column called "Art World" was opened in the Local Supplement, publishing news and reviews about art, sports, painting, music, dance, photography, and songs. After that, there were also economic special issues, national goods weekly magazines, medical weekly magazines, radio weekly magazines, construction special issues, etc., which were published successively to satisfy the readers' wishes.

From May 18, 1930, the "Picture Weekly" was added, published once a week, and was in charge of the famous reporter Mr. Ge Gongzhen. Mr. Ge had rich experience and selected materials very carefully. Moreover, it was printed on copperplate paper with rubber plates, which was even more beautiful. The *Shen Bao* had previously compiled and published Yinghuan Pictorial, Dianshizhai Pictorial, etc., which were the pioneers of pictorials, but with the progress of the times, stone-printed pictorials had tended to decline, so photographic plate-making replaced drawing, and rubber plates replaced stone printing.

After the founding of the Republic of China, the political situation was unstable and internal strife arose. Because Yuan Shikai claimed the title of emperor, there was the Yunnan Uprising; because the military governors were tyrannical, Zhang Xun took the opportunity to restore the monarchy, and there was the Machang Instructor; Duan Qirui was in power, and a chasm arose between the north and the south, and there was the Hengyang Uprising, and the southwest had the War of the Constitution. Then there was the Zhili-Fengtian War and the Shandong War. The domestic split became more and more serious, the political situation deteriorated day by day, commerce was depressed, finance was exhausted, bandits rose up, and the people were in dire straits. Until the National Revolutionary Army vowed to launch the Northern Expedition and established its capital in Nanjing, the overall situation gradually stabilized, and when the Northeast changed its banner, the great cause of unification between the north and the south was completed. The railway transportation was used by the newspapers to promote this, but every time there was a war, the railway was interrupted once. The rapid telegraph communication was relied on by the newspapers to develop, but every time there was a war, the telegraph communication was inspected once. The *Shen Bao* felt extremely difficult to cope with in this environment, but fortunately it was handled properly, and it was able to develop further in the stormy waves.

The *Shen Bao* worked hard to seize the door with the environment, so as not to fall behind the trend of the times. In addition to improving the content of the newspaper, it did its best to do everything that could increase the efficiency of the newspaper, such as the construction of large buildings and the purchase of new equipment. The *Shen Bao* Newspaper Office was originally located in the west of Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road, which is now part of the Shanghai Municipal Government Building. During the Xuan统 period of the Qing Dynasty, it moved to Shandong Road, which was slightly wider than before, but with the increasing development of business, the old house was no longer sufficient. It was gradually felt that renting private houses was not a long-term solution, and it was not suitable for the use of newspaper offices. For a permanent solution, it was decided to build its own building. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, it bought the base at the corner of Hankou Road and Shandong Road, and engaged in design and drawing, and construction, which is now the *Shen Bao* Building.

The new building started construction in the fifth year of the Republic of China and was completed in the seventh year of the Republic of China. It was moved in in October of the same year. The exterior of the house was magnificent and the interior was refreshing, costing 70,000 taels of silver. The Shanghai newspaper office also started with the *Shen Bao*. When the new building was not yet completed, the owner of the Shandong Road house urged it to move out for some reason. Therefore, a small house opposite was used as the business department, while the editing and printing departments were set up on Tianjin Road. It was inconvenient to travel back and forth between the two places, and the houses were cramped.

This five-story new building had more than 100 rooms inside, which was indeed more than enough at that time. However, the newspaper office's business expanded day by day, and the number of employees increased day by day, and the office space became smaller. Therefore, in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, a new building was added to the south of the old building, and the old building was combined into a 口 shape. Last year, a layer was added on the platform of the new building. Therefore, the front half is still five floors, and the back half has been changed to six floors.

After the completion of the new building, the printing equipment was also greatly renovated. The original machines of the newspaper office could only print 4,000 copies of newspapers per hour. However, sales increased day by day, which could not be handled by the original machines. Moreover, in order to make the news flow smoothly, the news manuscripts must be compiled at midnight and published at dawn, so as to catch the early train and transport them to other places. The printing time was only one or two hours. Therefore, in the year after the completion of the new building, the latest printing machine was ordered from the United States. In the eighth and tenth years of the Republic of China, three more units were added successively. Therefore, more than 100,000 copies of newspapers can be completely printed within two hours. In addition, copperplate machines, typecasting machines, paper plate machines, lead plate machines, and lead type copper molds were also purchased successively, and the equipment became more and more perfect, and the efficiency increased day by day.

The 21st year of the Republic of China was the 60th anniversary of the *Shen Bao*'s founding. When people reach their sixtieth birthday, they must raise their glasses to celebrate, and the *Shen Bao* has been operating hard for 60 years, not only establishing a foundation, but also making progress day by day, and its history is precious. On September 1, 1931, the museum "used this" year as a commemorative year, and planned to make new contributions to readers. It was announced on September 1. "First, start with the reform of the newspaper itself, and gradually promote it to various affiliated businesses.

How to reform the newspaper? The "Declaration of the 60th Anniversary of This Newspaper" published on September 1 explained the *Shen Bao*'s future direction: (1) Strive to promote new scientific knowledge to encourage the Chinese people's interest in research. (2) State the world's economic situation and dissect the economic characteristics of our country to seek the path to be taken in the future. (3) Investigate the problems of various social problems in view of the current contradictory phenomena to seek solutions. (4) To be sincere To the government, fulfill the public opinion. (5) Assist young people to solve difficulties and make progress on the healthy and pure road. (6) Discuss the plan and problems of immigration and border colonization, and urge them to realize it. (7) Awaken the Chinese people's understanding of our country's international situation, seek to get rid of the shackles of unequal treaties, and promote our country and nation to the position of freedom and equality."

In addition to improving the newspaper itself, affiliated businesses were also established one after another. In terms of publication, the *Shen Bao* Monthly, the *Shen Bao* Yearbook, the *Shen Bao* Map, and the *Shen Bao* Series have made great contributions to culture. The *Shen Bao* Monthly is a comprehensive magazine of politics, economy, and literature and art. It has been published since July 1931, stating the domestic and international reality and pointing out its trends to supplement the daily newspaper. Later, with the changing world situation, publishing once a month was considered too long. Therefore, in 1936, it was changed to a weekly magazine. In order to popularize it, in addition to retail subscriptions, it was also sent with the newspaper, which is the same as the weekly version of foreign newspapers. The yearbook collects important political, economic, and social events in the country for one year and makes a systematic narrative, with various statistics attached, which is a chronological history of our country's national conditions. From 1933 to 1936, a large volume was compiled and printed every year. The *Shen Bao* Series has been compiled and published since 1933, with the theme of world current affairs and various knowledge, and is also used to supplement newspaper materials. The publication of new maps is the most important item in the publishing business. Mr. Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and Zeng Shiying were hired to preside over it. They collected various precise materials and spent more than two years carefully surveying and mapping it. It was detailed and clear, and there was no better one at that time. The use of contour lines for coloring was a pioneering work. It is still a powerful figure in Chinese maps.

Secondly, in terms of social work, the *Shen Bao* Circulation Library, the *Shen Bao* News Correspondence School, and the *Shen Bao* Amateur Evening School were established one after another. The *Shen Bao* Circulation Library was founded in 1932 with thousands of books to provide vocational youth with proper entertainment and to increase their knowledge and skills. The *Shen Bao* Amateur Evening School is a sister of the Circulation Library, both of which are places for vocational youth to pursue further studies. When it was established in 1933, there were only two classrooms in the rest of the house of the Circulation Library in the mainland market, which could accommodate more than 80 students. Later, the number of students increased day by day, and branch schools were added. In less than two years, the number of students had increased to more than 2,000, and the number of branch schools had increased to as many as five. This shows that the youth's desire for knowledge is strong and the need is urgent. The establishment of the News Correspondence School was due to the lack of communication and communication among reporters in other places, so it was necessary to train them. Therefore, the school was established in 1932. The school used the correspondence method to train news personnel in various places. More than 800 students joined the school successively, reaching as far as India, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Many people from Europe, America, and Nanyang came to participate. This work not only has considerable gains for the *Shen Bao* itself, but also contributes more to local newspapers. Just as the *Shen Bao* was working hard to innovate and develop on the road of social culture, an unfortunate event suddenly occurred. On November 13, 1934, Mr. Shi was killed on the way back to Shanghai from Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Mr. Shi's death was not only unfortunate for the *Shen Bao*, but also for the national press, losing a talented person who could do great things. Fortunately, the internal organization of the *Shen Bao* was tight, and no impact occurred, and it continued to work for the cause. Many social and cultural undertakings organized by the *Shen Bao* on the occasion of its 60th anniversary were suspended one after another due to environmental reasons, and returned to their original positions, opening up a news network and enriching the content of the newspaper. Every year, people were sent to various places to collect data and write special articles, which was praised by all sectors of society.

On August 13, 1937, the war broke out. After three months of brave fighting by our army in Shanghai, the whole division was withdrawn for the sake of luring the enemy deep. Except for the concession, the whole city of Shanghai fell into the hands of the enemy. The enemy army was high-spirited and very jealous of the Chinese newspapers in the concession. They began to notify the inspection of new newspapers. The *Shen Bao* was angry and unwilling to be inspected by the enemy, so on December 15, it announced the suspension of publication. The *Shen Bao*, which has a history of 67 years, had to temporarily say goodbye to the readers of Shanghai.

Over the past seventy-five years, in addition to shouldering the task of reporting news itself, this newspaper has also been able to adapt to the needs of the times and society, successively publishing various types of books and periodicals, year after year; it can be said to have fulfilled a considerable responsibility in promoting culture. Now, a brief description of the various publications published by this newspaper in the past is made as a commemoration of the "75th Anniversary" and in admiration of the hard work of our predecessors, and also as a glorious page in the history of this newspaper.

Juzhen Edition Books

During the period from the first year of Guangxu to the twentieth year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, this newspaper used lead movable type to imitate the Qianlong "Juzhen Edition Series" to typeset and print new and old books. It is also called the Juzhen Edition Series (Note: In the thirty-eighth year of Qianlong, Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty ordered Confucian officials to compile the Yongle Dadian and other rare books and print them with wooden movable type, a total of one hundred and thirty-eight types, named "Juzhen"). More than one hundred and sixty types were published successively. As early as the eleventh month of the thirteenth year of Tongzhi, several types such as "The Scholars" had been printed and sold. During the period from the first to the fourth year of Guangxu, announcements were published to solicit contributions extensively. The original text is recorded as follows:

"Solicitation Announcement: This newspaper regularly prints and sells various books. If gentlemen from near and far have completed but unpublished works that they intend to publish, this newspaper is willing to purchase the manuscripts at a price and typeset and print them on their behalf. Alternatively, after the books are bound, dozens or hundreds of copies can be sent as a token of gratitude, which is also acceptable, depending on the salability of the book. Furthermore, if there are rare copies in the world that are suitable for reprinting, this newspaper can also buy them at a price or send dozens of newly printed books as a reward. The original manuscripts can still be returned after publication."

After receiving the manuscripts, they were generally published as soon as they were received. The content varied, mostly notes and miscellaneous records, but there were also quite a few novels in chapters. These series were printed using movable type, with a maximum of three thousand copies and a minimum of only one thousand copies. Moreover, they were disassembled after printing and could not be easily reprinted. To this day, there are probably very few copies left, making them extremely difficult to obtain. Fearing that readers would not be able to see the true face of the original books, a few types were selected and summaries were written for each to give a glimpse: Compilation of Treaties and Agreements, Six Volumes, Edited by Wang Chui

This compilation of treaties of various countries is a classified compilation of various treaties signed by our country with foreign countries from the Renyin year of Daoguang to the Jiaxu year of Tongzhi.

This massive book was called the "Kangxi Encyclopedia" by Westerners at the time, and this version was called the "Meicha Edition."

### Commemorative Publication of the Fiftieth Anniversary

In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, it coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of this newspaper. Therefore, experts were hired to write and compile "The Most Recent Fifty Years." The content was divided into three sections: (1) The World in the Past Fifty Years, (2) China in the Past Fifty Years, and (3) The News in the Past Fifty Years, as a commemoration. It was printed in February of the twelfth year, a large octavo book of more than four hundred pages, a finely bound volume, covering major events at home and abroad, trends of the times, academic inventions, and so on, with comprehensive and precise analysis and explanations.

Mr. Hu Shih's "World Philosophy in the Past Fifty Years" and "Chinese Literature in the Past Fifty Years" had already been published in the "The Most Recent Fifty Years" commemorative publication. In March of the thirteenth year, they were printed separately as single-volume editions and still distributed by this newspaper.

### "Education and Life" Weekly

On October 15 of the twelfth year, this newspaper published a weekly called "Education and Life." The content of this weekly included essays, academic discussions, education news, investigation reports, introductions and criticisms of new publications, and lecture records. In addition, it also had two special columns, "Sports" and "Friends of Youth," and was published every Monday. The data room of this newspaper currently still has a bound volume of the first to fiftieth issues of this weekly, which was published until September 29 of the thirteenth year.

### Pictorial Weekly

In the early years of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty, this newspaper had already used lithography to publish pictorials. "Yinghuan Pictorial" and "Dianshizhai Pictorial" were published successively as single-volume editions. However, the shadow-copied version and the regularly published "Pictorial Weekly" were first created on May 18 of the nineteenth year. Mr. Ge Gongzhen was in charge of the editorial affairs, carefully selecting current affairs photos and artistic photos from home and abroad, one sheet in folio, divided into four pages, published every Sunday, and attached to the newspaper without additional charge.

In the twenty-first year, the "January 28th" Incident occurred. This newspaper reduced its size, and the Pictorial Weekly was published until the eighty-sixth issue, and then temporarily suspended. On March 15 of the twenty-third year, the Pictorial Special Edition was changed to be published twice a week. From the 183rd issue, it was restored to one close-up edition per week. After the outbreak of the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan in the twenty-sixth year, it was suspended again. (Continued on page 21)

### On the Isolated Island of the Press

"A brush sweeps across a thousand soldiers," was originally just a saying. However, during these eight years of the War of Resistance, news reporters, relying on a worn-out brush, exposed the enemy's conspiracies, ignited public sentiment, and launched a spiritual attack on the enemy, much like a paper bullet, sharply and forcefully shooting at the enemy. Newspapers, which usually promoted culture, generated the power of struggle during the war, becoming a type of weapon besides artillery fire. At that time, a news reporter's brush truly equated to a brave general resisting three armies.

In the cultural battlefield, there were also several different strategic approaches. Newspapers in the Great Rear Area were like a defensive army, while newspapers in the occupied areas were like guerrilla warriors. Shen Bao, adopting the stance of soldiers on the front lines, engaged with the enemy on the isolated island for more than three years. This was the most arduous stage in Shen Bao's history, spending its days amidst the enemy's conspiracies and schemes. It wasn't until the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor incident on December 8, 1941, when the isolated island sank and Shen Bao was seized by the enemy, that this magnificent and tragic historical drama came to an end.

The July 7th Incident, the August 13th Incident - the enemy's artillery fire moved from north to south, and many newspapers were destroyed one after another. Although Shanghai had concessions, it became an isolated island after the National Revolutionary Army retreated westward. Recognizing the severe environment in Shanghai, Shen Bao ceased publication. Later, realizing that Shanghai was a very important stronghold in cultural strategy, it resumed publication in Shanghai on the Double Tenth Festival of 1938. From then on, Shen Bao began its life as a soldier.

After Shanghai became an isolated island, it outwardly maintained the international organizational form of the concessions, but the enemy's potential forces gradually infiltrated. Many newspapers, under the guise of foreign merchants, promoted the awareness of resistance against Japan, avoiding interference from the enemy. When Shen Bao resumed publication, it also put up the sign of an American business, meeting its readers again under the name of the Columbia Company.

The Shen Bao's resumption statement on October 10, 1938, elaborated on the significance of Shen Bao resuming publication in Shanghai. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Shen Bao "called for justice and humanity." When the National Revolutionary Army retreated westward and Shanghai became an isolated island, Shen Bao announced its suspension of publication "to preserve the last breath of freedom." However, with the continuous warfare and the distant prospect of victory, Shen Bao "did not want to remain silent for long," and thus established this new organization under an American company. The guiding principles for future commentary were: (1) To continue adhering to righteousness as its foundation, serving as the voice of the Chinese people, and fighting against the difficult environment. (2) To base itself on the principles of the Three People's Principles, inspire the self-confidence of the Chinese nation, promote unity, and cultivate courage. (3) To foster friendly relations between China and the United States. (4) To work together for world peace.

The guiding principles initially outlined were as described above. After resuming publication, Shen Bao proceeded based on these goals. Its commentary attitude promoted the established national policies, strengthened the belief in resisting Japan and building the nation, fully exposed the enemy's conspiracies, criticized Wang Jingwei's collaboration, and thoroughly and sternly condemned the atrocities of slaughtering compatriots. Internationally, it pointed out the enemy's ambition to challenge the world. It encouraged the relocation of compatriots and capital to the interior, and indicated the path that young people should take. Everything centered on the task of elucidating principles, supporting the leader, and coordinating with the national policies for resisting Japan and building the nation. This kind of commentary was greatly feared by the enemy, and the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department also paid special attention to it.

In terms of news, it tried to publish as much material related to the War of Resistance as possible, such as the central government's decisions, the Generalissimo's instructions, and especially proclamations issued on commemorative days, always finding ways to disclose them. After 1940, the enemy's oppression intensified daily, and it was very difficult to publish the full text. Therefore, it was rewritten into a news format and placed in the most prominent positions. Many news items about the War of Resistance and the Great Rear Area were not just published and forgotten. The proposed headlines had to grasp a central theme so that readers would be interested upon seeing them. In terms of content, it also strived to be consistent with the facts. What was most difficult to clarify was the situation of the enemy's and our forces facing each other, so maps were drawn at any time to complement the news, indicating the correct location for readers, even for a small village or a small river.

In addition, many feature articles were published, reporting the life impressions of the Great Rear Area to the readers in Shanghai, making them yearn for it. This material was mostly selected from newspapers in Chongqing, Kunming, Guilin, Hong Kong, etc., either directly reprinted or carefully rewritten. If foreign magazines had such articles, like the record of the American Life magazine publisher Roy E. Larsen's visit to Chongqing, or the report of the American writer Ernest Hemingway's visit to the wartime capital, they would be translated and published in the newspaper. If there were suitable photos, they would also be published as much as possible. This kind of special report greatly aroused the interest of the broad readership.

Regarding international issues, a large number of magazines and publications were ordered from the United States to systematically select articles, exposing the Nazi atrocities of invading Europe, accompanied by photos, under the name "Silent War Records." Among them, the arrogance of the Supreme Commander entering Paris, and the tragedy of the French military representatives negotiating on the train, were filled with indignation and made people vigilant. This work continued for a year and a half.

There was also the "Thief's Column." "Loose Talk" and "Spring and Autumn" also did a lot of work under the entire editorial policy. They published short and concise texts, exposing the crimes of the enemy and traitors, and did everything possible to satirize and rebuke them. For example, on the Double Tenth Festival of 1941, a special issue was published, and the writers were all well-known figures (but all used pseudonyms). Each article contained profound meaning and unlimited expectations. The article "Face Reality" was written based on the Generalissimo's exhortation to the compatriots across the country to "face reality."

In short, Shen Bao made every effort to seize opportunities to promote the awareness of the War of Resistance. Any related news and usable materials were never easily abandoned once grasped. In a situation of uncertainty and shock, this was very easy to incur disaster. Initially, the Shanghai Municipal Council set up a news censorship mechanism, but at that time, the enemy still feared the power of the British and Americans and did not dare to make excessive demands, so it was not very strict. As the situation shifted, the enemy's power in the concessions gradually expanded, and their attitude became tougher day by day. When the traitor arrived in Shanghai, dressed up like an ape, preparing to take the stage, the pressure on the press gradually increased. The "Special Operations Headquarters" at 76 Jessfield Road was established, and gangsters openly shot and arrested people in the concessions. In addition to anti-Japanese elements, anyone with a slight reputation and status in society who was unwilling to collude with them was their target. A dark and terrifying situation was created in the concessions, and news reporters felt threatened.

In the summer of 1940, everyone was talking about a blacklist of eighty-three anti-Japanese elements, and more than ten of them were employees of Shen Bao. At first, it was thought to be a threat, but as the rumors gradually intensified, people who were "wanted" began to be sniped at, and everyone became panicked. The entrance of the newspaper office was heavily guarded, and staff members also moved into the office to live, to avoid danger when traveling back and forth.

From July 1940, until the Pearl Harbor incident in December 1941, this year and a half was constantly filled with tension and terror. According to various investigations, the puppet "Special Operations Headquarters" first wanted to deal with Shen Bao, because if Shen Bao were to yield, other newspapers would be easier to manage. Shen Bao, standing in this position of being the first to bear the brunt, began to encounter the enemy's conspiracies and schemes. Seeing that the "wanted" people lived in seclusion and that the newspaper office's gate was so heavily guarded, making it impossible to start for a while, the puppets came up with another insidious plan. On April 5, 1940, Mr. Wang Yaoqin of Shen Bao was kidnapped from his home by several unruly thugs. They used threats to make Mr. Wang call the "wanted" people, inviting them to a secret place to eat, so that they could be rounded up in one fell swoop. Mr. Wang resolutely refused, saying, "I have lived to be over sixty years old, which is enough. If I die for justice, it would be a glorious sacrifice..."

At the same time, Mr. Huang Yanqing was arrested in another place, but they could not get a word out of him. Not long after, they attempted to kidnap Mr. Lu Yiming, but Mr. Lu learned of it beforehand and avoided it. So, they adopted the method of taking hostages, dragging away Mr. Lu's seventy-year-old mother and ten-year-old child, his whole family. But still, there were no results, and the traitors wasted their efforts.

When the enemy's conspiracy failed, another one was hatched. They adopted the method of stabbing people in the back, throwing hand grenades and setting time bombs, making it impossible to defend against. In the early morning of July 16, 1940, thugs threw a hand grenade from the newspaper's window, and for a time, smoke filled the air, and shrapnel flew in all directions. Five employees, including Shi Zhenghong and Wang Anlu, were injured, and Wang Anlu died soon after due to his serious injuries. When the thugs threw the grenade at the window, they threw two more grenades outside the door, and as many as fourteen innocent passers-by were injured by shrapnel. This was the first time Shen Bao was attacked by traitors.

After this incident, not only were those on the blacklist in danger, but other employees also felt uneasy. However, motivated by justice, everyone was not afraid of the enemy's threats and continued to fight. The newspaper office strengthened its defenses and remained calm as usual. Not long after the first bombing, the second one occurred. On a late autumn evening, the puppet "Special Operations" threw a total of three bombs, but not only did they not hurt anyone, but they also captured a thug. After interrogation, it was confirmed that he was instructed by Number 76.

At the beginning of 1941, because of the matter of the puppet "Central Reserve Bank," bombs were thrown twice in succession. On the eve of the opening of the puppet "Central Reserve Bank" on December 30, 1940, Shen Bao published a record of a symposium on the "Sino-Japanese Currency War," exposing the enemy's financial conspiracy and the plight of counterfeit currency, which greatly angered the traitors. On the afternoon of January 4, three hand grenades were found on the sidewalk in front of Shen Bao, but fortunately, they did not explode. Later, the puppet "Central Reserve Bank" sent a large advertisement for the opening, requesting that it be published on the opening day, but the newspaper office refused. On the evening of January 6, there was a fourth bombing. The thugs threw a total of three bombs, but only one exploded, injuring four passers-by.

In addition, there were two other times when the traitors secretly brought bombs in. Once, it was placed in the bookcase of the editorial department, and once, in the bookshelf of the library, hollowing out four or five Western-style books and placing a time bomb inside. Fortunately, the bombs were not sophisticated and had already lost their timing, otherwise, the explosion would have been even more dangerous. This happened between the summer and autumn of 1940.

In such a turbid and miasmic environment, and in a time of darkness and storm, the lives of news reporters were truly in imminent danger. Mr. Jin Huating, a reporter for Shen Bao, sacrificed himself under these circumstances. At four o'clock in the morning on February 2, 1941, Mr. Jin passed by the Dahua Ballroom on Avenue Edward VII and planned to hire a car to return to the newspaper office. Coincidentally, all the cars of the car rental company had gone out on business, so he had to wait there. Unexpectedly, the thugs had been lurking around him and immediately surrounded and attacked him. Because of the harsh environment and the need to go out for work, Mr. Jin had also prepared a pistol to prevent accidents. But at that time, he was caught off guard and did not take out the pistol, and the thugs fired several shots in succession. Mr. Jin was shot four times and died.

After investigation, the reason for Mr. Jin's death was the advertisement for the puppet "Central Reserve Bank." When the second advertisement for the puppet "Central Reserve Bank" came, Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao discussed ways to refuse it. Mr. Jin expressed his indignation at the side and analyzed in detail the reasons why it must be rejected. The newspaper office authorities listened to his reasons and resolutely returned it. This matter was discovered by the intelligence officers of the puppet "Special Operations," who placed all the responsibility for refusing to publish on Mr. Jin, and finally, he was martyred under the clutches of the traitors, martyred for the country. This spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness is admirable, and his heroic name will forever remain in the annals of history. I remember that a week before Mr. Jin's death, he said in a casual conversation with his colleagues, "My children are young, what will they do if something unexpected happens to me?" It is clear how distressed he was inside. And this sentence became his premonition.

During this period, there was also a work that is worth mentioning, that is, the development of the student aid movement. The student aid movement was originally unrelated to newspapers. But the newspaper office itself is a social enterprise, which should serve the public. In the past, Shen Bao ran many cultural enterprises, which had many effects. At that time, in that dark Shanghai, this type of work was even more needed.

The beginning of this work can be said to be very accidental. In the summer of 1940, a poor child owed tuition fees, and by the end of the semester, he was still unable to repay them, so the principal sued him in court. After the news was published, many enthusiastic people voluntarily sent money to the newspaper office, requesting that it be handed over to the student. On the first day, more than a thousand yuan was received. In three days, the donations received could be used to support the child until he graduated from middle school. So, his parents were notified, and they were asked to bring the child and his report card to the newspaper office to talk. The results were indeed good. The money was handed over to him, and the receipt was made into a plate and published in the newspaper the next day. This connection led the colleagues of the newspaper office to organize a student aid movement.

In the summer of 1941, the "Shen Bao Reader Student Aid" was started. All the staff of the newspaper office took on various tasks, and a committee was established to preside over this matter. After the student aid movement was launched, it won the sympathy of society, and donations poured in. Most of the donations were money earned by ordinary citizens with their blood and sweat, saved by economizing on food and clothing, which was even more precious.

The newspaper office handled this donation based on the two principles of "purity" and "simplicity." It paid special attention to the family situation, academic performance, and conduct of the applicants, which can be said to be the main basis for the review.

Since the student aid movement was launched in the summer of 1941, many poor students were helped that summer vacation. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the newspaper was controlled by the enemy and could no longer fully exercise its power to promote national policies. So, it put more energy into the student aid movement. From the summer of 1941 to 1945, lasting four and a half years, Shen Bao received a total of about 40 million yuan in donations. More than 20,000 students of all levels, from elementary to high school, were helped. This great act of righteousness was completed by the joint efforts of the newspaper office and the readers. It demonstrated the power of human mutual assistance and promoted the noble spirit of service.

### Record of Ernest Major

Ernest Major was the founder of Shen Bao. In 1871, he and his friends Woodhead, Prlay, Wachello, and Hoffer joined together to run a Chinese newspaper, each contributing 400 taels of silver, for a total of 1600 taels. On May 19th of that year, a partnership contract was signed, which is the first important document in the history of Shen Bao. Although there were four elders, Major was the key figure among them. The idea of running Shen Bao was also his original idea, and after it was opened, he also served as the first host.

Major's name was Annerst Major. In the early years of Tongzhi, he and his brother Friedrich came to China to do business, selling foreign cloth and tea. He slowly learned the Chinese language and writing, and became more familiar with the Chinese situation. One year, he suffered a loss in business and was very discouraged with his original profession, and he had the intention of changing careers. At this time, the sales of Shanghai Xinbao were very good. Major's comprador Chen Xinsheng suggested running a newspaper, and Major also expressed his agreement. So, he consulted with his friends and hired Qian Xinbo to go to Hong Kong to investigate the newspaper industry as a reference. Therefore, when this newspaper was first published, it imitated Hong Kong newspapers. In the inaugural issue, there was the following passage: "The making of newspapers originated from Westerners and was introduced to China. Having seen the Chinese-character news in Hong Kong, the style is very good. Now, imitating its meaning, Shen Bao is established in Shanghai." Major was a very fair and enlightened person. Although he was British, the opinions of Shen Bao were not biased towards Britain. He said, "This newspaper is for Chinese people to read, and the writing should be from the Chinese perspective." He very much wanted to make China move towards modernization, and sometimes he himself wrote editorials, vigorously advocating it. He was indeed a good friend of China, but unfortunately, the atmosphere at that time was narrow-minded, and his ideas were too high-minded and unpopular, and did not attract attention in society.

Major hosted Shen Bao, and the business was booming. So, he also started the Dianshizhai Printing Bureau and the Jiangsu Water Works, and the business became more and more prosperous. His brother's tea business also turned around, and there were profits every year. At that time, there were not many foreigners in Shanghai, and the two brothers were very respected by the foreign businessmen. Ernest Major was once elected as a director of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

In 1889, the Major brothers suddenly had thoughts of home and prepared to return to their country. So, they reorganized their businesses into the Major Brothers Company, including the Jiangsu Water Works, the Suichang Match Bureau, the Shenchang Bookstore, and this newspaper office. The total capital of 300,000 taels was divided into 6,000 shares. The Major brothers recovered their original capital, converted into 2,000 shares, and sailed back home.

Major's wife was the daughter of a bar owner, slim and beautiful, the most beautiful of the Western women. In British customs, family background was still valued, and it was thought that those who ran bars would not be upper-class figures. Only Major was infatuated with his daughter. At that time, many friends advised him, and many people ridiculed him, but he ignored them all.

Outside Nicheng, there was a club organized by Westerners, called the "International Association." The qualifications for membership were very strict, and the members were all well-known figures. Major was also one of the members. Later, because he was in love with the daughter of the bar owner, his membership was revoked. But Major did not mind at all, and continued to run his business. Every day after work, he returned home to enjoy his tenderness and beauty, and declined all external banquets and social events. After more than three years, the business developed day by day. The foreign businessmen originally had great faith in Major, and although they did not associate with him for three years, they respected him even more than before. Three years later, the International Association re-invited Major to join, but he only laughed it off.

In 1908, Major died of illness in England at the age of seventy. This newspaper office received the telegram on March 28th of that year and deeply mourned the old labor of this founder. So, on the newspaper of March 29th, a short biography of Major was published.

### Review of Publishing Undertakings of This Newspaper (Continued from Page 19)

*Shen Bao Monthly*

"Shen Bao Monthly," which commenced publication on July 15th of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], although intended to commemorate the 60th anniversary of this newspaper, was the subject of great expectations. The inaugural editorial of the monthly stated: "It is our sincere wish that this publication become a public forum for the academic and literary world, and a free liaison for the works of various scholars and the general readership."

The journal's aims and content focused on elucidating the international situation, discussing domestic current affairs, introducing academic thought, and promoting productive enterprises. Thanks to the efforts of the contributors, it received praise from all sectors after publication.

Due to a change in editorial policy, it was decided to switch to a weekly publication, and thus the 12th issue of the 4th volume of "Shen Bao Monthly," published on December 15th of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], was its final issue.

*Shen Bao Yearbook*

"Once statistical science flourishes, and the art of statistics advances, the evolution of humanity and the traces of social change can be seen in their true colors through numerical tables. As the Western saying goes, 'Figures don't lie.' The sufficiency of statistics far surpasses written records. To compile various statistics for reference is the function of a yearbook. Therefore, in addition to the daily newspaper and monthly magazine, this office also has the yearbook to follow."

The above passage is excerpted from a few sentences in the preface to the first volume of "Shen Bao Yearbook," published in December of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], titled "The Purpose of Publishing the Yearbook." A total of four volumes of the yearbook were published, ceasing after the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936].

*Shen Bao Weekly*

"Shen Bao Weekly," which focuses on the explanation and recording of current affairs issues of the week, was launched on New Year's Day of the 25th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1936], succeeding the "Shen Bao Monthly," which had been decided to cease publication. This weekly was published every Sunday and distributed with the newspaper, resulting in more widespread circulation. It continued until the outbreak of the full-scale War of Resistance, when the weekly was also forced to cease publication.

*Shen Bao Monthly's Auxiliary Publications*

The publishing house of *Shen Bao Monthly* edited and published a total of eleven auxiliary books. The first was "Memoirs of the Battle of Shanghai" by General Weng Zhaoyuan, listed in November of the 21st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1932], which went through three editions. The second was "Studies of the Soviet Union," followed by: "Studies of the Abundance of People and Beauty," "Selected Creative Novels, First Collection," "General Situation of the Chinese Economy," "Inspection Records of Gan, Wan, Xiang, and E Provinces," "Selected Creative Novels, Second Collection," "Lectures on the Current State of the Chinese Economy," "Conversations on India," "Selected Essays," and "Records of What I Have Heard at Chunlu," etc.

*Shen Bao Auxiliary Books*

The Shen Bao Auxiliary Books were edited by the "Shanghai Library" and published by this newspaper, starting in June of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]. A large portion of them concerned the domestic and international situations, with the most about Japan and the Soviet Union, including: "Japan's Wartime Economy," "The Japanese Army," "The Japanese Navy," "Japanese Aviation," "Japan's Military Industry," "On the Current Situation in Japan," "On Contemporary Japanese Figures," "The Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan," "The Lives of Soviet Women," "The Soviet Union's Agricultural Five-Year Plan," "Education in the Soviet Union," "On the Current Situation in the Soviet Union," "Outline of Russian History," "A Brief Explanation of the Soviet Constitution," "An Overview of the Soviet Economy," "Twelve Studies of the Soviet Union"; there were also those concerning war and armaments: "New Weapons (Part 1)," "Comparative Study of Armaments of the Great Powers," "On War," "European and American Aviation," "Air Warfare," and "Armaments of the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union," among others; the rest were: "Collected Advice to Shen Bao Readers," "Outline of Planned Economics," "On Modern Film," "Wireless Reader," "Young People," "America's Wartime Economic Plan," "World Economic Conference," "Inspection Records of the Northwest," "Collection of National Humiliation Speeches," "Where is Germany Going," "On the Greater Nanyang," etc., totaling as many as forty types.

Map Production

The suggestion for this newspaper to compile maps originated with Mr. Ding Wenjiang, and it was endorsed by the late General Manager of this newspaper, Mr. Shi Liangcai. Mr. Ding then invited his colleagues, Mr. Weng Wenhao and Mr. Zeng Shiying, to begin compiling in the winter of the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930]. In the process of compiling, they also prepared the plates, and by the winter of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], the entire map was completed, with two types of maps printed:

(A) *New Map of the Republic of China* – Published on April 20th of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], a large octavo volume, exquisitely bound. The contents were divided into: General Map of Administrative Divisions, General Map of Topography, General Map of Transportation, Climate Maps, General Map of Cities, General Map of Languages, Mineral Resources Maps, Agricultural Production Maps, Various Ethnic Group Maps, Topographic Maps of Various Provinces, Maps of Important Cities, and a Table of Railway Distances. It also had five advantages: (1) It consulted both domestic and foreign documents and widely consulted world experts to newly determine latitude and longitude numbers. (2) It was based on various actual topographic maps from provincial survey bureaus, railway bureaus, water conservancy agencies, etc., referring to a total of seven or eight thousand maps before and after. (3) Terrain elevations were differentiated by layered coloring. (4) It referenced more than 1,500 maps made by foreign countries, correcting many errors in previous editions. (5) The entire map was drawn using two projection methods, polyconic and Albers equal-area conic projection. Place names were separately indexed by radical index, four-corner code index, and Roman phonetic index for easy reference.

(B) *New Provincial Maps of China* – Published on August 16th of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933]. This map was actually a prototype of the former, because the former was larger in size and more expensive, so it was negotiated with the original compilers, Mr. Ding, Mr. Weng, and Mr. Zeng, to reduce this map for use by schools, youth, and the general public.

Both of the above maps became excellent reference books and can be said to be one of the major contributions commemorating the 60th anniversary of this newspaper at that time.

Children's Reading Material

Recognizing the importance of children's education to the nation, this newspaper also devoted itself to the publication of children's reading materials. Starting from Children's Day in April of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935], in addition to compiling and printing Children's Day commemorative albums every year, this newspaper also compiled and printed the children's weekly published in this newspaper into a separate volume called "Children's Friend," one volume per year, totaling three collections, until the full-scale War of Resistance broke out, when it was temporarily suspended.

In June of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], this newspaper published various popular reading materials for children, beautifully printed and richly illustrated, including "Five Righteous Men of Suzhou," "Wu Xun," "Su Wu Herding Sheep," "Jie Zitui," "Niu Lu," "Lin Xiangru and Lian Po," etc., all of which were works that cultivated personality and inspired integrity. In July of the same year, more volumes of popular science reading materials were published, specifically for children to read.

Other Publications

In addition, the number of miscellaneous books published by this newspaper over the years is also quite considerable. Their titles and years of publication are recorded as follows:

*Game Methods for Boy Scouts*, *Observations on a Trip to America* (both in the 8th year of the Republic [i.e., 1919]), *Reference Materials for the Pacific Conference*, *One Hundred Secrets of Success*, *Western Maxims*, *Records of the Far East Inspection of the American Congressional Delegation* (all in the 10th year of the Republic [i.e., 1921]), *Advertising and Life* (in the 14th year of the Republic [i.e., 1925]), *Selected Shen Bao Commentaries, First Collection* (Shen Bao's Student Essays Solicited for the 60th Anniversary), (both in the 21st year of the Republic [i.e., 1932]), *Wireless Research, First Collection*, *Commemorative Album of the Sixth National Games* (both in the 24th year of the Republic [i.e., 1935]), *Inspection Records of the Northwest, Volumes 1 and 2*, *Royal Fragrance Amidst Misty Clouds* (both in the 25th year of the Republic [i.e., 1936]), *True Records of the European War, Volumes 1 and 2* (in the 30th year of the Republic [i.e., 1941]), *Shen Bao Shanghai Citizen's Handbook* (in the 35th year of the Republic [i.e., 1946]).
*National Assembly Commemorative Booklet*. On November 15th of last year, the National Assembly grandly opened. This newspaper prepared for it several months in advance, compiling a type of National Assembly Commemorative Picture Album, which was published on February 1st of this year, colorful and magnificent, worthy of being a historical record of an epoch-making era.

### In the Past Seventy-Five Years: This Newspaper's Advertising, Distribution, and Other Matters

I. Advertising

Advertising and newspapers now have an inseparable relationship; for any newspaper, advertising revenue must be the greatest element for sustaining its life. However, the history of general stores not hanging advertisements in front of their own doors but publishing them in newspapers is not very long. It goes without saying that the earliest Chinese newspaper—*Chinese Monthly Magazine*—did not have advertisements; even the publishers of the later newspapers did not think of using the position of the newspaper to publish notices as a source of income for the newspaper. Exactly when did the gentlemen at the newspaper suddenly think of soliciting advertisements? This question is not within the scope of this article. However, when *Shen Bao* was first published in Shanghai seventy-five years ago, advertisements had already been found in the newspaper.

The "Regulations of This Newspaper" in the first issue of *Shen Bao* contained the following "Advertising Publication Regulations":

"If there are advertisements for postings, cargo ships, brokerage prices, etc., wishing to be published in this newspaper, with fifty characters as the standard, those buying one day will be charged 250 copper coins; if there are more characters, 50 copper coins will be added for every 15 characters. Those buying two days will be charged 150 copper coins, with 30 copper coins added for every ten characters from the starting point. If there are those wishing to buy three or four days, the price is the same as the second day."

From these "Advertising Publication Regulations," it can be seen that, first, the advertising fee for "buying" one day and "buying" two days was different, and the difference was quite large. For the newspaper authorities, this was certainly a way to encourage customers to "buy" several days, in order to increase the newspaper's own income. Second, from these regulations, it can be seen that the advertising fee at that time was really very cheap. Because at that time, the general public was still quite unfamiliar with newspapers, and the matter of "buying" advertisements in newspapers was simply a bit "incomprehensible." Everyone was still not very clear about what effect publishing an advertisement in the newspaper would have on them, so the *Shen Bao* authorities specially lowered the advertising fee to encourage them.

However, the above advertising publication regulations were only limited to Chinese people; they did not apply to foreigners and foreign firms who came to "buy" advertisements. Perhaps the owners of the newspaper believed that it was no longer necessary to lower the advertising fee for foreigners with blue eyes to "use for encouragement," so the advertising publication regulations set for Westerners were quite harsh. The same fifty characters cost one silver dollar, with one cent added for each character, which was four times higher than the advertising fee for Chinese people, and it was necessary to "collect the publication fee in advance" and "limit it to one day." If they wanted to "buy" several more days, then "this newspaper is limited by space, and the price will be negotiated separately."

Here, we would like to mention the general form of advertisements at that time. There is no doubt that the arrangement method at that time was not at all elegant, and the people who published advertisements certainly had not read "Advertising Psychology" and knew nothing about the effect of stimulus-response! The stores simply drafted a manuscript, took it to the newspaper, and after the editor added a title (just like editing news), it was published in the next day's newspaper. The wording of the early advertisements was all the same. Apart from a title written as "Selling Foreign Soap" or "Selling Foreign Goods," the beginning of the main text was always "Notice: This store sells... a full range of supplies. Please visit No. X, XX Road for discussion. The price is exceptionally fair, with no deception of the old or young." At the end, a sentence was added: "Respectfully announcing this," and then "XX No., Month X, Day X, Notice" was added to complete it.

This kind of advertising format almost continued until after Emperor Guangxu ascended the throne. However, in these few years, the advertising business of the newspaper had made considerable progress: First, it was the expansion of quantity. When this newspaper was first published, because people in society did not understand the effectiveness of advertising, the advertisements published in the newspaper were only for a few foreign firms and a few businesses near the newspaper office. But by the twelfth year of Tongzhi [i.e., 1873], the amount of advertising had greatly increased. At that time, each issue of this newspaper had eight pages, and advertisements accounted for almost four pages at the back (at that time, the arrangement was news in the front and advertisements in the back). Therefore, in November of the twelfth year of Tongzhi, the font size of the advertisements was reduced by one size to accommodate more advertisements. Second, it was the enrichment of quality. In addition to stores promoting their businesses, announcements and advertisements for finding people also appeared in the newspaper. In addition, in the first year of Guangxu [i.e., 1875], theaters gradually opened and lotteries began, and these advertisements increased day by day. Third, it was the adjustment of prices. From the twelfth year of Tongzhi, the advertising publication regulations were set at a fee of five li per character for the first day and two and a half li per character for the second day, uniformly for both Chinese and Westerners, with no distinction between high and low.

In the thirty years that followed, apart from advertising clients improving the wording of advertisements and using different fonts and pictures to attract the attention of readers, there were few other changes. Starting from the thirteenth year of Guangxu [i.e., 1887], the advertising publication regulations changed the currency from cash coins to silver dollars, with each fifty characters costing 25 cents for the first day, 15 cents per day from the second to the seventh day, and 12.5 cents per day from the eighth day onwards. The position of advertisements was still at the end of the news. Clients who published advertisements not only did not "sit in numbered seats," but also did not have a distinction between "flower building," "building seats," "front hundred," or "back hundred," with everything being uniform, just like the audience going to see an early movie on Sunday.

The start of improvement was in the thirty-first year of Guangxu [i.e., 1905]. At this time, the social atmosphere was relatively open, and the newspaper business in Europe and America had already matured, affecting the Chinese newspaper industry. At the same time, the owners of *Shen Bao* also felt that such an advertising arrangement method was too unrefined, so they only then divided the advertising publication regulations into several types, such as "front page," "back page," "long line," and "short line," and the prices were also readjusted. This was a big step forward. As a result of the implementation, many people came to *Shen Bao* to publish advertisements, and it was almost impossible to accommodate them all. Starting from the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu [i.e., 1908], advertising fees were no longer calculated per character but per line, as they are now. At this time, the development of *Shen Bao* was very smooth, and advertising continued to increase. At the same time, due to the expansion of news coverage, it increased from one large sheet to two large sheets, and then increased to three large sheets, and this continued until the overthrow of the Qing court.

When the Republic was founded, everything was renewed, and this newspaper also engaged in renewing its content and expanding its layout. In terms of advertising, there were also great improvements. At that time, the front page advertisements (i.e., cover advertisements) often accounted for about two and a half pages, and there were also many back page advertisements. The *Shen Bao* authorities therefore opened up "middle seam advertisements," which were published in the "rectangular area" where the newspaper was folded in half, and the price was the same as the cover advertisements. This seems a bit "odd" now, but at that time, it was considered an innovation. Currently, general small-sized daily newspapers still use this type of "middle seam advertisement." At the same time, at the top of the commentary page, a "important notices" section was opened up. Although this position was not as good as the cover, it was also quite prominent, and the four large characters "important notices" naturally attracted more attention from readers. Many businesses published long-term advertisements in this position. The social economy at that time was not as chaotic as it is now. If it were now, then no business would publish long-term advertisements in the newspaper. From that time onwards, the distribution and advertising of this newspaper laid a solid foundation, and the business was booming, always leading the way. However, the purpose of the *Shen Bao* owners was not purely to make money. They paid great attention to social service, so this newspaper often allowed many poor people who wanted to publish an announcement to do so for free. There was a period when there were often people from the countryside who came to Shanghai and lost their beloved sons and daughters on the road, crying and pleading with the newspaper to help them find them. Out of consideration for humanity, this newspaper specially published free "finding child advertisements" in the "important notices" section, stipulating: "Anyone who is poor and comes to publish a 'finding child advertisement' will be exempted from fees; if there are illiterate people who cannot draft the advertisement themselves, this newspaper can also draft it for them."

Starting from September of the seventh year of the Republic [i.e., 1918], a narrow space was opened up along the top and bottom edges of each page to serve as a "special advertisement." For those published on the first, second, and third pages of the first sheet, each horizontal row cost 8 yuan per day at the top and 6 yuan per day at the bottom. The fourth page of the first sheet and the third page of the second sheet, etc., cost 3 yuan per day at the top and 2 yuan per day at the bottom. By this time, the grades of advertisements were invisibly divided into five grades:

Special Grade (Special Advertisement)

First Grade (Cover Long Line)

Second Grade (Middle Seam Long Line)

Third Grade (Ordinary Long Line)

Fourth Grade (Short Line)

This "special grade advertisement" was abolished in the eighth year of the Republic [i.e., 1919], and the fourth grade advertisement was also abolished in the ninth year of the Republic [i.e., 1920]. From April of the tenth year of the Republic [i.e., 1921], the advertising publication regulations were only calculated per line per day, abolishing the old rule that "the publication fee for the first day is more expensive, and the publication fee for the second day is cheaper."

In the past thirty years, the advertising business of this newspaper has been constantly developing. Due to the soaring cost of living, the adjustment of advertising publication regulations has also been repeated countless times (especially in the recent ten years). Regarding the improvements and developments in advertising, there are several points that can be specifically mentioned: First, what must be mentioned first is the publication of classified advertisements. Classified advertisements have been practiced in European and American newspapers for a long time, but Chinese daily newspapers before the tenth year of the Republic [i.e., 1921] had not yet thought of this. The advantages of classified advertisements do not need to be mentioned by me, everyone already knows. In hundreds of large and small advertisements, readers can quickly find the advertisements they need based on the classified sections, which is really the most economical and effective method. In view of this, this newspaper specially opened a classified advertisement column around the twelfth year of the Republic [i.e., 1923]. Later, when *Shen Bao* published the local supplement, classified advertisements were published on the supplement. At that time, classified advertisements were divided into the following categories: (1) Sales, (2) Purchases, (3) Announcements, (4) Rentals, (5) Renting Houses, (6) Hiring, (7) Seeking, (8) Seeking Employment, (9) Celebrations, (10) Real Estate, (11) Property, (12) Education, (13) Medicine, (14) Finding.

This type of classified advertisement, except for occasional slight changes in the subheadings, has never been interrupted until now.

Secondly, it is the expansion of the advertising space. From the tenth year of the Republic [i.e., 1921] to before the war, this newspaper often published three to six large sheets, plus the local supplement, the automobile supplement, the common sense supplement, and the weekly pictorial, etc., in which advertisements constantly accounted for about seven-tenths. Full-page advertisements were not uncommon, such as the Xth version of "Investiture of the Gods" performed on the Tianchan Stage, which also published full-page advertisements in *Shen Bao*. After the war, because the source of paper was not easy, the size could not be increased at will. The *Shen Bao* authorities adopted a principle of refined compilation, and the advertising space was naturally also limited. However, after decades of cultivation by pioneering colleagues, the advertising business of this newspaper had already established a century-old foundation.

### The Past Seventy-Five Years: The Newspaper's Advertising, Distribution, and Other Matters

(Continued from page 22) 2. Distribution

When the newspaper was first established, the distribution process simply involved staff members distributing copies daily to various businesses, entrusting them to sell on consignment. In addition, the newspaper hired newspaper vendors to sell on the streets. At the time, the retail price was eight cash coins per copy, and ten coins per copy for distant sales. The extra two coins were considered the vendors' meal money. Wholesale to businesses from the newspaper office was priced at six coins per copy. Comparing these prices to current ones, the difference is truly vast. Roughly estimated, the newspaper's price has increased at least two hundred thousand times over the past seventy-five years.

At that time, the total circulation was only around six hundred copies. Distribution locations were mostly within the city, and there was no so-called "distribution network." By the end of the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi era, circulation had doubled, totaling one thousand two hundred copies. In May of the second year of the Guangxu era, it doubled again, becoming over two thousand copies. The following year, it doubled again, becoming five thousand copies. With the straight-line increase in circulation, the distribution range gradually expanded. Initially, the newspaper contacted local stores and letter agencies in the suburbs to distribute the newspaper. Then, it sought development in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas. According to the newspaper's records, by the sixth year of the Guangxu era, the newspaper was distributed in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Wuchang, Hankou, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Hong Kong, Anqing, Baoding, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Hangzhou, Fuzhou, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Ningbo, Yantai, and other places. Letter agencies in other areas uniformly sold the newspaper on consignment. Although the organization of the "distribution network" was not robust or tightly knit, it was indeed considered quite extensive.

At that time, the newspaper's distribution method, apart from sending special staff to various distribution points for sales in this area, relied entirely on letter agencies for areas outside of it. Because the newspaper had not yet established branch offices or distribution points in other areas, and the delivery methods were limited to postal delivery, it would take one or two days to receive the newspaper in places like Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In distant places like Hong Kong and Tianjin, the sent newspapers had already become old news, and the news value naturally greatly diminished. It was not until the twenty-third year of the Guangxu era that wholesale points were established in major cities to ensure that the readers could see the newspaper on the same day. Starting from the thirty-first year of the Guangxu era, the newspaper began to establish Shen Bao branch offices in various places. Many of the newspaper's current branch offices in various parts of the country were established at that time and have a history of forty years.

The first price adjustment occurred in the second year after the newspaper's founding, with an increase of two cash coins per copy, making the retail price ten coins, twelve coins for other areas, and eight coins for wholesale. For provinces without established wharves, the price was calculated annually, at four silver dollars per copy per year. The second adjustment occurred twenty-six years after the first price adjustment (the twenty-fifth year of the Guangxu era), with another increase of two coins. However, there was no increase for other areas, and the prices were uniform for local and out-of-town sales, but for newspapers sent to other areas, postage fees were added according to the distance. The third adjustment was in the eleventh and twelfth years of the Guangxu era when the cash price was changed to silver dollar price. The newspaper's price was changed to 1.4 cents per copy and 45 cents per month. The following year, the annual price for other areas was 5.4 silver dollars, 2.7 silver dollars for half a year, 8.4 silver dollars for Japan annually, and 10.8 silver dollars for European and American countries annually. It should be added that at that time, the Shen Bao was already sold in Japan, Europe and the United States.

After this, there were occasional price adjustments, which we need not list one by one. Fortunately, for the past hundred years, the prices of goods, including the newspaper cost, have only increased with each adjustment, up, up, and up. However, the increase in the price of the Shen Bao, apart from the increase in paper prices and the increase in postage fees, was largely due to the increase in the number of pages. The newspaper's page count increased from one large sheet to two large sheets, three large sheets, four large sheets, five large sheets, six large sheets... even ten large sheets, the price adjustment was of course inevitable.

Let's talk about sales. The first few years have been mentioned above. For clarity, let's look at the chart below.

(Year) (Sales Volume)

1872 600

1875 1,200

1876 2,000

1877 5,000

1912 7,000

1916 14,000

1917 20,000

1920 30,000

1921 45,000

1931 50,000

1925 100,000

1926 141,440

1936 150,000

In the ten years from 1926 to 1936, sales always hovered around 150,000 copies, so they are not included in the table. (Among them, in the first half of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), sales once exceeded 200,000 copies.)

Then came the war. The newspaper once moved to Hankou and Hong Kong to publish. In the 27th year, it returned to the "isolated island" to resume publication. During the three years of the isolated island period, due to the seriousness of the newspaper's speech, sales increased without end. Although sales in other areas were affected due to the war, the people in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang could still buy Shen Bao from Shanghai merchants every day.

If there is something to say, it's lengthy; if there is nothing to say, it's brief. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the newspaper resumed publication in Shanghai with glory. Thanks to its long history, solid foundation, the efforts of the host and all colleagues, it quickly restored its former appearance in a few months. At present, the number of publications is increasing day by day, and it seems to exceed the number of publications before the war, and the distribution network, from domestic areas far to Xikang, Xinjiang provinces, foreign countries far to New York, Chicago, Berlin, London, the newspaper has offices in all of these places, managing the distribution matters of this newspaper.

3. Supplements

The newspaper was initially a single large sheet. From the eighth year of the Guangxu era, a supplement dedicated to news from the capital city, called the "Beijing News Supplement" was added. This supplement was published for a long time, until the end of the Guangxu era. In the third year of the Xuantong era, due to "the daily progress of the world and the complexity of human affairs," a reform of editorial policy was announced, and the supplement "Free Talk" was launched at that time. Starting from January of the sixth year of the Republic of China, a column was opened on the fifth sheet, called "Old Shen Bao," carrying "a review of more than forty years," and extracting strange articles and stories, as well as political, customs, poetry, game articles, etc., published over the past forty years to readers and then discontinued.

The above is a rough introduction to the early supplements and columns of the newspaper. Looking at the nature and content of these supplements and columns with modern journalistic eyes, of course, we cannot give them too high an evaluation. The "Beijing News Supplement" simply copied imperial edicts, and the early "Free Talk" and other supplements also simply talked about romance, played with the arts and painting. Therefore, these supplements were added specifically for the general scholar-official class, and at that time, the Shen Bao was indeed a newspaper for the scholar-official class.

However, times are constantly advancing, and the essays of the scholar-officials are gradually being eliminated. Here, we will begin to describe from the eighth year of the Republic of China - at that time, it was the aftermath of the First World War, and the Chinese people were eager to understand the current situation of the new world and the relationship between the international community and China. Then, the vigorous May Fourth Movement took place, and the young people's demand for new knowledge became more and more enthusiastic. At the same time, the social undertakings in this city progressed very rapidly, and the number of local chronicles increased day by day. Due to these reasons, the newspaper added a variety of supplements and columns to meet the needs of readers in various aspects.

After this, it was also a period of rapid expansion of the content of Shen Bao. The important supplements are as follows:

A. Weekly Supplement: First published on August 31 of the eighth year of the Republic of China, a large sheet was published every Sunday and sent with the newspaper. The content was to publish systematic records of international current events and to translate and translate articles and important news from foreign newspapers and magazines to supplement the inadequacy of daily international news telegrams. Later, in the autumn of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, it was discontinued due to the occurrence of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang war and the contraction of the paper.

B. Common Sense Supplement: First published on June 1 of the ninth year of the Republic of China, with the purpose of introducing new knowledge of various subjects and cultivating healthy citizens, it was published daily. The content included common sense, economy, health, science, municipal administration, etiquette, miscellany, and other aspects. There was also an illustration every day, criticizing the dark forces and promoting the spirit of freedom. It stopped publication at the end of March of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China.

C. Automobile Supplement: First published on November 27 of the tenth year of the Republic of China, a large sheet was published every week and sent with the newspaper, publishing articles and news promoting the construction of highways and automobile knowledge.

D. Local Supplement: The Local Supplement was the creation of this newspaper. Zhang Zhuping, the former manager of this newspaper, explained the reasons for the creation of this event: "The purpose of this newspaper's creation and distribution of the Local Supplement is to facilitate the posting of advertisements by all sectors of the local business community, so it is limited to the local reason, one is because the content is limited to the local area (such as various details or the day's events, etc.), one is because the value of local advertisements is lighter, and the amount paid outside is twice that of the local area, I will use the two points of paying less postal tax and less paper consumption to directly give the local advertising users substantial benefits, the facts are obvious, and now the industry is following suit!"

The Local Supplement was first published on February 8 of the thirteenth year, and was published daily. In addition to publishing forecasts and records of various social activities in Shanghai and advertisements for theaters and shops, a column called "Art World" was opened daily from September of the 14th year.

E. Book Weekly: First published on May 18 of the 19th year of the Republic of China, sent with the newspaper. It was temporarily suspended when the Songhu War broke out in the 21st year. On March 15 of the 23rd year, it was renamed "Picture Special" and published twice a week. It was discontinued when the all-out War of Resistance began in the 26th year.

In addition, a "Commercial News" column was opened on October 31 of the 13th year of the Republic of China, and a "Education News" column was opened on December 8 of the same year, and a second supplement "Spring and Autumn" was opened in the 21st year. In addition, Shen Bao Monthly, Shen Bao Weekly, Shen Bao Yearbook, Shen Bao Industry Book... etc., were published one after another, forming the most brilliant page in the Chinese press. These are detailed in the article "Review of the Newspaper Publishing Business", and will not be repeated here. Later, in the 24th year of the Republic of China, "Science Weekly," "Popular Lectures," and "Medical Weekly" were published.

I don't want to write more about the situation after the war. Readers should be able to understand it. Let me add a little bit about the celebration supplements for commemorative festivals as the end of this section.

The first "National Day Special" was added on the Double Tenth Festival in the seventh year of the Republic of China.

The first "New Year's Day Special" was added on January 1 of the ninth year of the Republic of China.

The first "Jesus Christ Special" was added on the eighth year of the Republic of China

4. Paper and Illustrations

The early newspaper used locally produced bamboo paper, which was thin and soft, easy to break. When reading the newspaper, you had to sit upright and be careful, and you would tear it if you were not careful. However, the words printed on it were clear and did not impair the reader's eyesight. At that time, it was printed inside, with eight pages per sheet, each page about nine and a half inches long and wide. From August of the 13th year of the Tongzhi era, the paper was slightly flared, divided into two rows, separated by lead lines, and it was only done for one month, and it was still changed to a long line.

From March of the 24th year of the Guangxu era, glossy paper was used, which was smooth and not easy to get wet. It was not until the Xuantong era that high-quality newsprint was used, and the layout was enlarged at the same time. From bamboo paper to glossy paper, and then from glossy paper to white paper, this is the progress of the newspaper paper.

Copperplate illustrations began to appear in the news in October of the seventh year of the Republic of China. The attached picture is a copperplate picture published in this newspaper, "Group Photo of All Students Sent Abroad by the Ministry of Education." However, at that time, inserting copperplates into the news could be said to be rare. If you compare it with the current "newspaper", it is of course not comparable.
