### Second Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty External Affairs Ministry to Release Statement Tomorrow Eagerly Hoping the Soviet Side Respects Its Obligations

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] The 14th of this month marks the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a solemn statement, detailing the implementation of the treaty between China and the Soviet Union over the past two years, as well as the progress of various negotiations between the two countries. The statement will address the crux of current issues between China and the Soviet Union and the prospects for friendly relations between the two countries. This aims to inform the nation and the world of the difficult facts regarding the implementation of the treaty over the past two years and the government's continuous efforts to overcome these difficulties. The statement will also convey an earnest hope to the Soviet Union, urging it to respect its treaty obligations. According to informed sources, frequent diplomatic incidents have occurred in recent months, with frequent negotiations between China and the Soviet Union. An unpleasant atmosphere has been gradually moving toward a normal and reasonable course. However, there is a trend that cannot be allowed to continue. For example, regarding the issue of the recovery of Dalian and Lushun, the reasons given by the Soviet Union are based purely on a misinterpretation of the treaty, with a strong intention to occupy the area for a prolonged period. Regarding the issue of the northern Mongolian border, the Soviet side has openly assisted Outer Mongolia in military operations with aircraft and supported the fabrication of evidence by Outer Mongolia regarding the Sino-Mongolian border. All of these actions lack a credible basis and are far from international morality. Our side stands firmly on solid legal and logical ground. Future actions may not be simply ineffective arguments, but possibly the selection of a variety of forceful measures. Even if the Soviet Union's interpretation of the treaty and the basis of its claims are completely contrary to our side's, it should not act arbitrarily and unilaterally against the peaceful and reasonable methods of resolving disputes stipulated by international law. At this time when the diplomatic situation is extremely bleak, this statement marks a new era in Sino-Soviet diplomacy and may gradually brighten overall diplomatic negotiations.

### Wei's Envoy Arrives in Shanghai from Taiwan Today Yesterday Inspected Keelung Harbor and Factories Mission Denies Plans to Train Troops in Taiwan

[Our Report] General Albert Wedemeyer and his party are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. They will fly from Taiwan to Jiangwan Airport at 2:30 PM. Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Executive Yuan Information Office will be dispatched to the airport to welcome them. The Special Envoy plans to stay in Shanghai for two days to organize the information he has gathered and meet with representatives from the country's industrial and commercial sectors. The detailed itinerary will be decided after his arrival in Shanghai. It is only known that the U.S. Acting Consul General Meyer will host a banquet on the evening of the 14th.

[Our Taipei Bureau, 12th] General Albert Wedemeyer personally presided over a round table meeting at 9:00 AM, listening to reports from the economic, educational, and factory groups. Attendees included leaders from the Education, Construction, Finance, Transportation, Agriculture and Forestry, and Health departments, as well as executives from various companies of the Resource Commission. General Wedemeyer left the meeting at 10:30 AM to visit the Peng Meng Zhen, Deputy Commander of the Garrison Command. The meeting continued and adjourned at 12:00 PM. At 3:30 PM, he went to Keelung to inspect the harbor and fertilizer factory.

[U.S. Information Service, Taipei, 12th] A spokesman for the Wedemeyer Mission denied reports that General Albert Wedemeyer's visit to Taiwan was to inspect or discuss the possibility of the island serving as a military training zone. He stated, "The mission did not discuss any military-related issues during its stay in Taiwan."

### Korean People Oppose Trusteeship

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] Min Seok-rin, deputy head of the Korean Provisional Government's delegation to China, told this reporter on the 12th that the delegation had submitted a memorandum to General Albert Wedemeyer. The main points of the memorandum can be divided into three areas. The most important point is to protest the five-year joint trusteeship decided at the Moscow Conference. No other nation has been placed under trusteeship after this war. However, Korea, with its four-thousand-year history, has suffered this kind of unequal treatment. Koreans consider it a great shame and will strive for complete independence. The second point is that the work of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission should be reviewed and re-evaluated. It has been almost a year since the liberation of Korea, but the Joint Commission has made no progress. The Korean people cannot tolerate further delays by the two countries, as the general living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult, leading to starvation. The third point is to remind of the expansion of the armed forces under Soviet control in North Korea and to point out that the U.S. governance policies and measures in South Korea are improper due to a lack of understanding of the Korean situation. In particular, economic policies must be changed, and the blockade of foreign trade must be stopped. Min stated that there is no reason for the United States to treat Korea more harshly than Japan. He hoped that General Albert Wedemeyer and his mission would discover all the irrational facts when they arrive in Korea in the future. Wedemeyer has stated that his mission is to investigate the recovery capabilities of China and Korea. However, given the current tragic situation in Korea, recovery is a distant prospect. The Korean people must first obtain autonomy and independence.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] Du Guang-hsun, Wu Zhao-xu and other representatives of the Northern Twenty-nine Provinces and Cities Relief Association, recently sent a letter to Albert Wedemeyer, explaining the importance of the North and its relationship to world peace. Du and others are scheduled to visit Albert Wedemeyer at 10:00 AM on the 19th.

The allocated ships will sail to designated locations around the 24th of this month. China received eight ships in this allocation, which will sail to Shanghai. When the Chinese naval representative drew lots today, he was granted the first choice and received the third group of ships, including the Yue-class destroyer.

Other smaller vessels, such as patrol boats, lifeboats, and minesweepers, will be drawn in the first week of September.

### Sichuan Province's Conscription and Grain Collection Expected to Meet Quota by New Year's Day

Chairman Deng Xihou Says

[Our Chengdu Bureau, 12th] Regarding the conscription and grain collection issues in Sichuan Province this year to support the suppression of the rebellion, Deng Xihou said on the 11th that Sichuan Province bears a great responsibility during the suppression of the rebellion. The conscription and grain quotas are the highest in the country. The central government has extended the deadline for conscription to the end of September. Zhitong and other counties have already reported that they have met their quotas. The people of Sichuan are eager to serve in the military, and it is expected that the quota will be met. In addition to the 9 million dan (unit of dry measure) of grain to be collected, an additional 5 million dan of public grain reserves will be collected, totaling 14 million dan. Under the active promotion of the provincial government, and with the patriotism of the people of Sichuan, it is expected that the quota will be met without any problems. The grain inspection team found that approximately 4 million dan of grain were owed in various places and decided to strictly pursue the collection of these arrears without any leniency.

### Wei's Envoy Understands Public Opinion More Comprehensively The Council Does Not Submit a Memorandum The Standing Committee of the Diplomatic Group Resolves

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] The Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council's Diplomatic Group held a closed meeting on the morning of the 12th to review the records of the exchange of opinions on General Albert Wedemeyer's visit to China at the Political Consultative Council's Fellowship Association on the 5th. After a long and careful discussion, they expressed their gratitude for Wedemeyer's diligent efforts during his visit. However, regarding the submission of a memorandum, it was decided not to submit it, and the review opinions will be sent back to the Fellowship Association in a letter. The attendees at today's meeting included Political Consultative Council members Fan Yu-sui, Zhang Qian-hua from the Diplomatic Group, and Yin Shu-xian, Wu Zhao-xu, Chen Shao-xian, Wang Jun-ying, and Gan Jia-xin, who are not members of the group. Secretary-General Shao also attended the meeting. During the meeting, opinions were divided on whether to submit a memorandum. Those who advocated maintaining contact with Wedemeyer included Wu Zhao-xu. Wu and others pointed out that Political Consultative Council members should explain the current situation to Wedemeyer from the standpoint of the people. Other Political Consultative Council members believed that this matter was of great importance, and the current Political Consultative Council is not a popularly elected parliament. Even if it were a parliament, it has never been heard of that the parliament of another country would submit a memorandum to a special envoy from another country. At the same time, during this recess period, a small number of resident committee members are insufficient to represent the opinions of all Political Consultative Council members. During his stay in China, Albert Wedemeyer has traveled to many places and contacted many people. Although many of them are government officials and party members, he has also had extensive contact with people from all walks of life and understands Chinese public opinion more comprehensively. It seems unnecessary to submit another memorandum. It is also understood by Wedemeyer that our country's construction requires American assistance. If Wedemeyer believes it is necessary to seek the opinions of the Political Consultative Council members, it is also permissible. Secretary-General Shao also expressed his opinion. In the end, it was decided not to submit a memorandum, and the temporary meeting of the Standing Committee originally scheduled for the 15th will no longer be held.

### Far Eastern Commission Announces Trade Policy Toward Japan All Imports and Exports Controlled by MacArthur

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th] The Far Eastern Commission announced today a provisional import and export policy toward Japan, consisting of sixteen points. Private individuals and companies can be approved to participate in Japan's foreign trade, but all imports and exports will be directly controlled by General Douglas MacArthur. Currently, unless approved by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, no private individual or government can have contact with the Japanese government or private individuals. The main points of the Far Eastern Commission's statement also include: (1) Foreign purchases and sales will be conducted on a government-to-government basis. Japan's foreign purchases and sales will be handled by its government. (2) The Supreme Commander is responsible for determining the types and quantities of goods available for export, as well as proposing the types and quantities of goods to be imported. (3) Currently, there are no definite funds, goods, or equipment that will be exported to pay for imports. (4) Industries whose exports would help Japan's war potential should not be developed, while textiles and other goods that are in short supply worldwide, especially in Asia, should be encouraged. (5) The proceeds from the export of current products, including current production of gold and other precious metals, will be primarily used to pay for past and current imports. (6) The proceeds from the export of raw materials and goods not included in reparations should first be used to pay for imports. (7) Cultural artifacts produced before September 1, 1945, as well as plundered gold, silver, and other precious metals in the occupied areas, may not be exported from Japan. Gold, silver, other precious metals, and jewelry that clearly belong to Japanese individuals should be allocated for reparations. In addition, the value of various Japanese assets should be preserved, but military uses to obtain foreign exchange to maintain an economic plan aimed at restoring Japan's peacetime economy are allowed. The Far Eastern Commission passed the above policy at its 67th meeting on July 24 and has submitted it to the Allied Headquarters for implementation.

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] Regarding the dispatch of a delegation to Japan for overseas Chinese affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted "Organizational Measures and Implementation Outline for the Business Delegation to Japan," which contains detailed regulations on the selection criteria and other matters. It is expected to be submitted at the first meeting of the Japan Trade Steering Committee to be held on the 13th.

### U.S. Navy Reverses Conviction in Shen Chong Rape Case Two U.S. Soldiers Acquitted Our Diplomatic Authorities Prepare to Lodge Representations

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] The news that U.S. soldier Pierson, who raped a female student in Beiping, was released by the U.S. Navy Department and had his rank of corporal restored arrived here in the afternoon of the 12th. All parties are paying close attention. The diplomatic authorities were particularly shocked and immediately ordered an investigation and made the necessary preparations to lodge a diplomatic representation after receiving formal notification from the U.S. side.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The Navy Department announced today that Defense Secretary Forrestal has ruled that there is insufficient evidence in the case of U.S. Marine Pierson, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison and dishonorably discharged by a local U.S. military court for raping Chinese girl Shen Chong in Beiping last December. The original verdict was declared invalid. At the same time, the case of U.S. Marine Prichard, who was sentenced to ten months in prison and dishonorably discharged as an accomplice, was also declared invalid due to insufficient evidence.

Regarding this case, Democratic Senator Johnson disclosed in June that after re-examination by the Inspector General of the Navy Department, it was believed that the evidence for the allegations was insufficient and the original verdict should be declared invalid. A few days later, Hu Shi, President of Peking University, issued a statement stating that this case was a test of American justice, and all of China attached great importance to it, hoping that Forrestal would not approve the above recommendation to acquit the two defendants.

The Navy Department also announced today that the evidence in this case was insufficient, stating that Shen Chong, aged nineteen, was with Pierson at the polo ground near a busy area of Beiping for about three hours before lodging a complaint the next day. Medical examiners from both China and the United States did not find any evidence of rape on Shen Chong's body.

Johnson stated in June that once Forrestal approves, Pierson can be released and have his military rank restored.

### Communist Bandits Attempt to Cross the Yellow River in Western Shandong National Army Attacks from Both Sides Wang Yaowu and Ding Zhi-pan Inspected Eastern Shandong Yesterday

[Our Jinan Bureau, 12th] On the 12th, Chen Yi's remnants crossed the Yellow River from the Shilibu area, 30 kilometers south of Dong'a, attempting to flee to the north bank. The National Army attacked from both the north and the south, and the Air Force conducted fierce bombing at the crossing point, causing heavy casualties to Chen's forces.

[Our Xuzhou Bureau, 12th] The Communist bandits in western Shandong are currently attempting to break through to the north of the Yellow River and the south of the Longhai Railway in two groups. After interception and pursuit by the National Army, they have fallen into the National Army's iron barrel positions northeast of Yuncheng and south of Cao County. Elite units of the National Army are shrinking the encirclement of the remnants of the East China Field Army 148th Division and Liu Bocheng's Second and Third Columns and Independent Brigade between the Yuncheng-Dongping Lake line in the northeast, with the goal of annihilating them in one fell swoop. In addition, Liu Bocheng's 167th Division and the New Fifth Brigade, totaling approximately 30,000 men, have been attempting to infiltrate the central area between Shangqiu and Lanfeng on the Longhai Railway for days. The National Army has been blocking and attacking them separately. Fierce battles broke out on the 12th at Lianditou (7 kilometers northwest of Shangqiu), Wangqiao (3 kilometers northeast of Yejigang), Dayiji (5 kilometers southeast of Cao County), Zhatongji (north of Lanfeng), and Liumiaoji.

### Yanchi County Seat Recaptured Several Crossings in Western Sui Sealed Off

The National Army is currently actively advancing towards Dingbian.

[Our Guihua Bureau, 12th] The Yimeng area is suffering from a combination of hunger, war, and chaos. The poor people are fleeing north in large numbers, creating an empty house situation. To prevent spies from infiltrating, western Sui has sealed off several crossings on the Yellow River.

[Central News Agency, Yulin, 12th] According to Communist bandits who surrendered to the National Army, "When launching the attack on Yulin, Peng Dehuai, Wang Zhen, and others said that the invasion of Yulin was intended to establish a Soviet government in the area and set a three-day deadline for its capture. Currently, the city of Yulin has been under siege for a long time without being captured, and the morale of the troops has been greatly shaken. The majority of officers and soldiers want to find an opportunity to surrender." The cooperation between the military and civilians in Yulin is good, and the defense is solid. A powerful National Army unit is expected to arrive on the 12th, and the Communist bandits' delusions will be thoroughly shattered.

[Our Zhangjiakou Bureau, 12th] Since the issuance of the General Mobilization Order, the bandits have also felt that their future is bleak, and the number of those who escape and surrender has increased daily. In July, the Chahar Province received 399 surrendered bandits. After providing for the costs of taking care of those surrenders, there are 2372 still housed in the city. Also, 12 bandits from the Liang Qingyun unit in the Longguan District, carrying 12 guns, surrendered to us on the 5th. In addition, eight bandits from this unit, carrying eight guns, surrendered to our Huai'an County on the same day. It can be seen that the morale of the bandits is deteriorating and the army is disloyal.

[Local News] According to the East China News Agency: Amidst the opening of trade with Japan, a large-scale smuggling case involving a Japanese ship recently occurred near Xiamen.

Reflections on the Anniversary of August 13th by Yang Hu

Ten years ago today, under the wise leadership of our supreme leader, the Chinese nation initiated the unprecedented and sacred War of Resistance against Japan in Shanghai. Although this battle lasted only over eighty days, it exerted its maximum effectiveness in the political, diplomatic, and military aspects. The Battle of Shanghai occupies the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese nation's revival. On the day the Battle of Shanghai broke out, I happened to be re-appointed as the Garrison Commander of Shanghai and was also ordered to serve concurrently as the Martial Law Commander of Shanghai. The former's primary task was to assist the frontline military, while the latter's primary task was to ensure local security. It was my principle to perform these two tasks simultaneously without neglecting either, mobilizing the military and civilians to exert all efforts to defend the local area and the country. On the eve of the war, I was summoned to Nanjing and personally instructed by the supreme commander. I felt the gravity of the responsibility even more deeply. Before our main forces arrived at the designated frontline positions, my task was to command the local military and police to secure the vanguard positions, awaiting the arrival of the main forces from the rear. After our main forces arrived, my troops, in addition to fulfilling our own responsibilities, mobilized all available local manpower and material resources to contribute to the War of Resistance. Looking back, from the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai until the withdrawal of our troops to the west, we relied on the sincere assistance of our military and civilians, as well as friendly allies, to accomplish our mission. I am deeply grateful. Time flies, and it has been two years since our victory in the War of Resistance. Looking at the current situation, in terms of international relations, the United States and the Soviet Union stand opposed to each other, engaging in mutual suspicion and rivalry. The friction in Eastern and Western Europe is also intensifying. Furthermore, Japan, our enemy during the war, is being treated with a policy of appeasement by the United States, which seeks to use Japan as its main strategic base in the Far East, providing assistance and support without reservation. The increasing strength of Japan is something that should deeply concern us. On the other hand, within our own country, the dream of peace talks has long been shattered. The nation is weakening due to years of war, and the people are suffering. Our supreme leader is overseeing the overall situation, working diligently day and night, which inspires all of us. Today, the affairs of the nation are something that none of our compatriots can ignore. The national mobilization order has been issued, and Special Envoy Wedemeyer has come from afar despite the hardships. It is hoped that all compatriots will rise up together, and under the leadership of our supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek, quickly quell the internal strife and strive for the success of national reconstruction. This is my reflection and the greatest wish of my life.

Editorial: Commemorating August 13th!

The sound of cannons in Shanghai on this morning ten years ago marked the beginning of China's full-scale war of resistance. Due to the disparity in military strength between the enemy and ourselves, the Battle of Shanghai only lasted for more than eighty days. However, the valiant resistance of the Chinese army and civilians established the belief that the entire nation would "surely win the war of resistance." In particular, the isolated army of Xie Jinyuan's battalion in Zhabei fought to the last, not only causing a sensation throughout China but also earning the sympathy and admiration of the world. Therefore, the outbreak of the August 13th Battle of Shanghai will never be forgotten in the hearts of our nation. After eight years of resistance, China finally achieved victory, which not only comforts the souls of the fallen soldiers in heaven but also encourages the youth to continue their efforts. Logically, when we encounter the anniversary of the August 13th Battle of Shanghai, we should all be excited and welcome August 13th with new emotions. However, today I am filled with mixed feelings. Although the enemy has been defeated, in less than two years, the defeated enemy is trying to make a comeback. Looking back at our own country, because of the communist bandits who are raising troops and causing chaos, the fruits of victory have been almost completely spoiled. The people in the war zones have not only failed to escape from the abyss of suffering due to the victory of the war but have instead sunk deeper into it. Even the people in the rear, although not directly suffering from the devastation of the communist bandits, are inevitably threatened economically and feel the pain of the people's livelihood being difficult. Therefore, today, as we commemorate the most glorious August 13th anniversary in our nation's history, we are filled with emotions!

However, most of the four million citizens of Shanghai personally experienced how our military and civilians fought bravely from the outbreak of the August 13th full-scale war of resistance until the retreat of the isolated army in Zhabei on November 1st of the same year! During this period, countless touching and admirable deeds were created, inspiring the people of the whole country. The arduous perseverance of the eight-year war of resistance cannot but be said to be the result of the inspiration of the military and civilians throughout the country by the Battle of Shanghai. Now, the Chinese government is like a brave man cutting off his wrist, and has no choice but to order the suppression of the chaos, so that after the source of the domestic chaos is eliminated, the country can embark on the road to national rejuvenation. The current difficult situation is no less than it was ten years ago today; the rise and fall and survival of the country are all tied to the thoughts of the Chinese people. If the suppression of the chaos cannot be ended soon, the nation's vitality will inevitably be exhausted, and the blood and tears shed during the eight-year war of resistance will not be in vain? How can we comfort the souls of the fallen soldiers in the Battle of Shanghai?

Therefore, when we commemorate August 13th, we must carry forward the Shanghai spirit of the August 13th Battle of Shanghai, regardless of party affiliation, gender, or age, we should unite and strive together. We should use the spirit of resistance to clear away the obstacles on the road to national reconstruction, so that the country will no longer be threatened by the communist bandits; in the active aspect, we should especially save on food and clothing and devote ourselves to the great cause of national reconstruction. We must ensure that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the belief that "national reconstruction will surely succeed" can be fully realized. Chairman Chiang telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Council the day before yesterday, hoping that the citizens of Shanghai would be able to understand the difficulties of the times and actively contribute to the government's requisition of food; all citizens of Shanghai should rise up in response, in order to preserve the most glorious anniversary of the War of Resistance in the history of the nation!

A Five-Year Plan

According to a report from Nanjing yesterday, China's first five-year railway construction plan after the war has been drafted. The selection of all routes emphasizes the connection between the mainland provinces and the border provinces, thereby achieving the goals of strengthening national defense, improving people's livelihood, and developing heavy industry. This five-year plan, although part of the overall plan for China's rejuvenation and reconstruction, is that railway transportation is nothing less than the main artery of a modern country. With everything in ruins after the war, if we want to talk about rejuvenation and reconstruction, we must start with the construction of railways. Therefore, the government's drafting of this five-year plan is actually the first step for China to start the work of national reconstruction during the suppression of the chaos, which deserves our attention.

According to statistics, China currently has more than 27,000 kilometers of railways. Compared with the country's area or population, the percentage is really too small. Moreover, the distribution is biased towards the Northeast and Taiwan. According to statistics from the Ministry of Communications, within the 27,000 kilometers, the Northeast's railways account for more than 11,300 kilometers, and Taiwan accounts for 1,200 kilometers. The mainland provinces account for only 14,554 kilometers. This uneven distribution should be actively remedied. Therefore, the first five-year railway construction plan should not add icing on the cake and build railways in the Northeast or Taiwan again. It is reported that the railway lines to be built in the five-year plan are divided into four major systems: (1) the Northwest System, centered on the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, is the main artery of transportation between the Northwest and Southwest; (2) the Southwest System, centered on the four provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi, is an important route for China's transportation with Myanmar and Vietnam; (3) the Southeast System, centered on the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian, can become the driving force for the development of China's southeast economy in the future; (4) the Border System, which will build five railway lines, totaling 3,700 kilometers. The focus is on strengthening China's national defense.

From a general point of view, this five-year plan has been carefully studied by the Ministry of Communications, and it can be said to be quite complete. However, the problem now is not whether the plan itself is complete, but whether the government can complete it as scheduled. The railways to be built in the four major systems total more than 14,300 kilometers. In terms of China's actual needs, increasing more than 14,000 kilometers of railways in five years is not too much. Moreover, Chairman Chiang pointed out in his book "China's Destiny" long ago, according to his father's industrial plan, that China must build 140,000 kilometers of railways in ten years. Now, the first five-year plan builds 14,000 kilometers of railways, which is only one-tenth of it. Therefore, this plan should not only be completed as scheduled within five years but should also be completed earlier.

However, looking back at the actual situation in China, the communist bandits are raising troops and causing chaos, destroying transportation everywhere, making people live in deep waters. The little vitality that the country has left after the war will also be completely eliminated in the war. Under such circumstances, it seems impossible to complete this five-year plan by relying solely on its own resources and manpower. Therefore, in terms of material technology, China cannot do without foreign investment and technical cooperation. The United States has always required China to submit a plan for its loans for China's rejuvenation and reconstruction. Now that this five-year plan has been drafted, the United States should assist China in completing this plan as scheduled!

Indonesia Rejects US Mediation, Still Insists on Arbitration by Security Council; Dutch Suddenly Propose Round Table Conference

[Associated Press, Batavia, 12th] According to semi-official reports from Yogyakarta, the Republic has rejected all US proposals to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. The Indonesian Antara News Agency stated: After US Consul-General Foote visited Yogyakarta on the 11th, Indonesia sent a letter to US officials, stating that the Republic insists that mediation should be carried out by an international committee established by the Security Council.

[Reuters, Batavia, 12th] Acting Dutch Governor-General Van Mook recently issued a statement proposing the immediate establishment of a temporary Indonesian federal government, exercising its authority in areas currently occupied by Dutch troops, as well as in the Indonesian Republic, East Indonesia, and West Borneo. Van Mook also stated that the establishment of this government would not hinder the task of the mediation mechanism proposed by the United States. Van Mook further suggested convening a round table conference immediately to discuss the steps to establish this government. He specifically invited Indonesian leaders to cooperate on this new proposal and stated that once the government is established and has the appropriate ability to maintain order throughout the territory, the Dutch government plans to withdraw a significant number of Dutch troops currently in Indonesia.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 12th] The Security Council will resume discussing the Indonesian issue today after discussing the Balkan issue.

[Reuters, Batavia, 12th] Today's Dutch military communique stated that 350 Indonesian soldiers attacked a Dutch patrol southwest of Anyer, Central Java, with rifles, machine guns, and grenades, causing slight casualties to the Dutch side.

Jiang Tingfu Decides to Raise the Issue of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 11th] Jiang Tingfu, the acting representative of China to the Security Council, told a Central News Agency reporter today that he will raise the issue of overseas Chinese in Indonesia when the Security Council continues to discuss the Indonesian situation on the 12th. He declined to comment formally at this time but said he would speak at the Security Council on the 12th. The United Nations headquarters has not been able to confirm the report from Batavia that a delegation of overseas Chinese in Indonesia will go to Lake Success, USA, to request the United Nations to take action to protect the overseas Chinese in Indonesia.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 11th] The local branch of the Chinese Kuomintang today called on all overseas Chinese newspapers and organizations to demand that the Chinese government use force to protect the overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra, stating that force is the only effective measure to protect overseas Chinese. At the same time, the local Kuomintang asked our representative to the Security Council to refrain from making any decisions until the atrocities against overseas Chinese in Indonesia are stopped.

Indonesian and Dutch Representatives in the US Claim to Do Their Best to Protect Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, New York, 11th] Appeals from overseas Chinese leaders in Batavia and Semarang because the Indonesian government has failed to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in its territory have been met with denials, counter-denials, accusations, and counter-accusations from both Indonesian and Dutch representatives here. Indonesian Special Envoy Sharir told a Central News Agency reporter that the accusations of the overseas Chinese in Java are part of a Dutch propaganda offensive to undermine the reputation of the Republican government. Sharir firmly declared that the stories of Indonesian people mistreating overseas Chinese are absolutely untrue. A spokesman for the Dutch delegation to the United Nations said that the fact that the overseas Chinese in Java are also accusing Indonesia of destroying the lives and property of Chinese should explain everything. Both sides said they would do their best to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese in their areas. Sharir said that the Republican government has, in fact, taken special measures to protect overseas Chinese. The Dutch side revealed that the Dutch-Indonesian government has spent one million guilders to help overseas Chinese. Sharir pointed out that there are two Chinese cabinet members in the Indonesian cabinet, namely Wang Yongzhi, who serves as Deputy Minister of Finance, and Xiao Yucan, who serves as a Minister without Portfolio. This is a sure guarantee that the interests of all overseas Chinese in the Republican territory can be taken care of by the cabinet. However, a Dutch spokesman said that the radio speech by the Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Batavia could prove that the Indonesian accusations that the Dutch military destroyed the lives and property of overseas Chinese are untrue. A Dutch spokesman declined to comment on the reports that the Chinese Navy Headquarters is considering proposing to send Chinese warships to Indonesia to perform a mission of comfort to protect the Chinese nationals in the area.

Government Economic Emergency Measures Bill Passes Third Reading in British Lower House; Becomes Law Once Approved by Upper House

[Associated Press, London, 12th] After nearly seventeen hours of continuous debate, the British Lower House passed the government's economic emergency bill with an overwhelming majority of 178 to 63 on the morning of the 11th. The bill has now been sent to the Upper House, which may subject it to extensive amendments, as was the case with the previous nationalization of transportation bill. Exhausted members of the Lower House held a final vote in complete silence. After the Lower House rejected all amendments proposed by the opposition party (except for two amendments that were adopted), the Lower House completed the third reading of the bill, and Attorney General Shawcross, a key figure in the Labor Party, handed it over to the Upper House.

At the beginning of the Lower House meeting, Conservative Party leader Churchill engaged in a heated debate with government supporters regarding the government's request for full peacetime powers. Churchill attacked the cabinet, saying that it was requesting powers that no British government had ever dared to request except in times of great enemy presence. This attack was rebutted by Morrison and Shawcross.

[United Press, London, 11th] Labor Party members of Parliament held a secret meeting today to vote in favor of Prime Minister Attlee's cabinet's decision to postpone discussion of the nationalization of the steel industry bill, which may be postponed until after the economic crisis.

The Labor Party members of Parliament's secret meeting also resolved to demand that the government immediately resume trade negotiations with the Soviet Union. Minister of Commerce Cripps replied that future actions must be viewed by the Soviet Union. Other Labor Party members demanded a reduction in the military, a larger number than Attlee proposed. Government personnel replied that they are doing their best to reduce the number of soldiers in the army, navy, and air force. Regarding steel issues, a government spokesman said at the meeting that the government has no intention of abandoning the state-owned plan, but the cabinet should be free to choose the appropriate time. It is rumored that Minister of Health Bevan is prepared to resign if the government decides to abandon or indefinitely postpone the state-owned steel industry plan.

The letter also stated, "France is waging a full-scale war in Vietnam and has reduced Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Madagascar to a state of slavery. The Security Council is so concerned about the Balkan guerrillas but turns a blind eye to mechanized troops. It is incomprehensible that the appeals for justice and peace from the people of Vietnam and Madagascar are ignored."

[Reuters, Petrópolis, Brazil, 11th] Diplomatic sources here say that the Pan-American Conference may establish a mutual defense pact stipulating the establishment of a mechanism to handle disputes in the Western Hemisphere, without going through United Nations mechanisms. It is understood that one of the clauses in the draft agreement proposed by Brazil, if adopted, will establish an agency to prevent communist activities in the Americas, and may enable Argentina to submit its dispute with Britain over the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic to a Pan-American regional mechanism instead of to the United Nations mechanism, as well as the dispute between Honduras and Britain over British Honduras, and the claims of Argentina and Chile to Antarctic territory can also be submitted in this way. It is expected that the treaty to be established by the Pan-American Conference will stipulate that when taking mutual defense measures, the United Nations mechanism must first be notified, and only when these measures cannot achieve the expected results can they be submitted to the United Nations mechanism. In this regard, the presence of United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi at the Pan-American Conference is highly valued. If he feels that the establishment of the aforementioned mechanism has a tendency to overstep the powers of the United Nations mechanism, he should express his opinions.

[Reported by our newspaper] Regarding the bloody clash between military police and police at the Jindu Theater, Chief Bao Qihuang of the Prosecutor's Office of the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense and others continued their investigation yesterday. Those interrogated included Li Tianjie, police officer No. 6143 of the Laozha Police Precinct, Yang Xunzhang, police officer No. 6716, Zhuo Qingbao, chief of the Xincheng Police Precinct, Xia He, deputy chief, Gu Qi, a staff member, Zheng Kuan, police chief No. 3612, Yun Heng, Li Baozhen, Xu Jianbin, Mei Zhuoliang, and Tong Yinzhi, all police officers, Wu Bolian, a military policeman, Liu Heqing, manager of the Jindu Theater, Li Dayu, assistant manager, Zhao Qingliang, general affairs manager, Gu Yongquan, a tea server, Yu Naisen, a police officer stationed at the theater, Qian Hongsheng, manager of the White Rose Barber Shop, Lu Sicheng, a clerk at the Great Xia Leather Products Store, and Parlier, a military policeman from the US Navy, totaling twenty people. The interrogation lasted from 10:30 AM to 7:00 PM. Chief Bao, considering that police officers Li Tianjie, Li Baozhen, Yang Xunzhang, Xu Jianping, Mei Zhuoliang, and Tong Yinzhi, police chief Zheng Kuan, and military policeman Wu Bolian were more suspected of committing crimes, ordered their detention and transfer to the garrison command for custody, pending further questioning. The others who were initially questioned were ordered to return. Over ten people who arrived in court yesterday but were not questioned are scheduled to be interrogated again at 8:00 AM this morning. If the interrogation can be completed before noon, the collegiate court will be convened this afternoon. Chief Bao explained that although the police do not have military status, the military law department has the power to detain them during the military law trial. The purpose is to prevent them from colluding in their statements, and the police are also suspected of criminal activity in this case and are at risk of fleeing, so they are temporarily detained. However, the military court will not sentence the police. After the entire case is tried, they may be transferred to the local court for trial according to judicial procedures.

In addition, Director Liu visited the Municipal Council yesterday, but Speaker Pan was out on official business and was received by Secretary-General Xiang Changquan.

This morning, he will go to the Jindu Theater on Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road to conduct an on-site inspection. Director Liu estimated that the interrogation will take about two days to complete.

Jindu Grand Theater Suffers Another Scare; Huile Lane Gets a Cold Shoulder; Policeman Injured in Jingqin Lane

[Reported by our newspaper] The Jindu Grand Theater on Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road had once suspended performances after the tragedy occurred. Recently, it resumed business.

After the officers of both sides met, the plainclothes military police were taken away by their officers, and no accident occurred. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 PM that night, eleven plainclothes military policemen suddenly came to the Meixing Brothel at No. 4, Huile Lane, 253 Yunnan Road.

Short Selling Profit-Taking Offsets, Chinese Stocks Turn Stable After Weakness

Financial stocks such as No. 103, No. 45, and No. 207 were actively bought, and the young stock No. 163 turned from short to long.

Also, it is learned that all colleagues in this city went to bid for the wholesale enemy-owned export aged tea that was publicly auctioned by the China Trust Bureau for the third time last week.

Rice Re-enters Weakness, Grains Decline Across the Board
Yesterday, more than 2,700 stones of rice and grain arrived in the north and south markets. The market situation re-entered a weak state due to digestion turning dull. Xian rice had more supply than demand, falling by 10,000 yuan. Japonica rice returned lower by 35,000 yuan. White rice followed suit and fell by 10,000 yuan. New japonica medium and second-class gradually revised, continuing to weaken by 35,000 yuan.
There were inquiries about flour in the north. The factory was very firm in selling, and the financial community also had an appetite, so the price rose by 12,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brand flour continued to rise by 23,000 yuan, while unified flour was still flat. Digestion of foreign flour was weak, falling by 12,000 yuan. Wheat bran sales were stagnant, and the factory continued to sell off, with a clear and dark weak trend.
Bean cake went downstream step by step, continuing to decline by 23,000 yuan. Arrivals of soybeans were crowded, and the appetite was not good. Aged beans fell by 11,000 to 15,000 yuan, and new beans continued to plummet by 10,000 yuan. Green beans from Sichuan and Hankou arrived one after another, with few buyers, and fell by 35,000 yuan again.
Adzuki beans were scarce and strong. Broad beans were traded in Shantou and Taiwan. This street's appetite strengthened, continuing to rise by 23,000 yuan.

The oil market in Guangdong stopped, and this street looked forward without moving. Raw soybean oil continued to fall by 230,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil and clear oil also fell by 120,000 yuan. However, sesame oil rose by 340,000 yuan due to the high production price.
[Our Newspaper] The Tantaila, manager of Jardine Matheson & Co.'s foreign department, arrived from Vancouver yesterday with 7,500 bags of flour, 350 railway steel rails, and 1,600 tons of timber, and is currently unloading at buoys No. 3 and No. 4.

Issue of Reducing the Price of Rayon Allocation, China Trust Bureau Submits to the Executive Yuan for Instructions, Silk Prices Decline, Factory-Managed Silk Goods Decline Across the Board
[Our Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau submitted a letter to the Executive Yuan yesterday for instructions on the request of the silk weaving industry to reduce the price of rayon allocation. The letter stated briefly: According to the principle originally set by your hospital for handling government materials, the price should not be lower than 20% of the market price. Now, the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association's request to reduce the price of rayon allocation has exceeded the scope of the Bureau's handling power, so it is specially submitted for instructions on the handling method for compliance.
Also, although the Central Trust Bureau's weekly distribution price of rayon has been announced, the silk weaving industry is still waiting for Mayor Wu to mediate and has not paid for the goods, so the black market price fell again yesterday. In the morning, No. 120 Takayama Yuko first called for a selling price of 4.2 million yuan, and then dropped to 3.8 million yuan for a transaction. In the afternoon, the price was called for 4 million yuan, but there was no transaction, a drop of 400,000 yuan from the previous day.
Due to the large number of sellers and the thin appetite in the market, yesterday's market prices for various grades of high uniformity were all 500,000 yuan short. Only E-grade was traded, with a price of 27 million yuan in cash. Mid-level scattered pieces were quoted for several pieces, with a price of 27.5 million yuan, with 10 million yuan paid first and the balance in 14-day term bills. Yesterday's dry goods market was very lacking in transactions, and the quoted price also fell.
Yesterday's silk goods market, real silk quilts, fell miserably again. Huagang goods opened with a quoted price of 10.1 million yuan, and then fell step by step. The final spot price was 9.92 million yuan, and the deferred date was 960,000 yuan, a drop of 350,000 yuan from the previous day. The reason was that the factory's opening price fell to 9.96 million yuan, and it was even sold off in the market, resulting in a complete collapse. Dacheng goods were also affected and fell together. The final closing price was 10.03 million yuan, and the deferred date was 70,000 yuan. 将十縐喊三萬四千元賣出, 三千五百元有人要, 未曾成交.

Spinning and Adjustment Subcommittee Decides to Maintain the Original Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn
[Our Newspaper] The spinning and adjustment conference price negotiation subcommittee was held at 4:00 PM yesterday. After discussing the cotton yarn negotiated price, it was decided to maintain the negotiated price standard of this week and make no new adjustments.

Yarn Prices Rebound
After several days of weakness, the yarn market rebounded yesterday because dyeing and weaving factories and retail investors absorbed slightly at low prices. The market's demand for coarse yarn was stronger. Owners, in view of the negotiated prices being higher than the market price, held on tightly, and the chips were tight, so the market rose.
Until the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rebounded by 300,000 yuan from the previous day to 15.8 million yuan. 110-count Double Horse also rose to 9.6 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming was 8.45 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan. The remaining coarse and fine yarns, except for 12-count heavyweight Special Jincheng, fell slightly, and the rest improved by 120,000 to 450,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth is Idle
Yesterday's cotton cloth market was mostly traded on the table. The trend of this street and foreign merchants was closed and scattered, and new sellers still participated in the activity, but overnight short positions were also offset, and the market was slightly supported. However, it was heard that a certain high-end Shilin cloth in Hong Kong added 20,000 yuan for freight; it was said that it could be shipped to Shanghai, making the selling atmosphere in the market feel even stronger.
Until the close, with the rebound of the yarn market, people in the industry had a lot of interest, and the market became slightly firm. Finally, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell by 6,000 yuan from the previous day to 383,000 yuan. The prices of various grades of fine cloth such as Wufu Jianji Caiqiu Yanghe continued to fall slightly by 78,000 to 20,000 yuan. Other serge, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, plain cloth, floral cloth, and Shilin cloth also fell uniformly by 56,000 to 120,000 yuan.

Small Factories Face Great Difficulties
Also, according to representatives of small factories who came to Shanghai a few days ago: Now the raw materials and expenses of yarn factories are increasing step by step. If there is no allocation of flowers, survival is unbearable, and the situation of small factories is even more critical. The representatives of small factories in Yuxi Tai and other places came to Shanghai last time to request the Spinning and Adjustment Committee to allocate flowers according to the example of large factories. Fortunately, the committee approved the allocation, but the small factories must first hand in the yarn, and then notify the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee to allocate flowers. If large factories allocate flowers first, there will be some days of waiting in between. The small factories felt uneasy after hearing this, because the yarn factory must first have raw materials to spin yarn. This is a certain principle. Furthermore, the small factories rely on the sale of finished products to obtain flowers and expenses. If the products are handed in first, the raw materials will be interrupted and the expenses will be impossible to meet. Therefore, the small factories feel that this move of the Spinning and Adjustment Committee is very difficult.

Spinning and Construction Company Sells Cloth as Usual
[Our Newspaper] China Spinning and Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 1,320 pieces, with a total of 30 application forms. One domestic manufacturer purchased 400 pieces of cloth, and 29 cloth shops purchased 920 pieces of cloth.

Jinlian Miaowu Yuan serge was sold for 390,000 yuan. Four Gentlemen's straight-grained wool was 510,000 yuan, and Jumping Carp gray light twill was 260,000 yuan. The listed price was 5,000 yuan higher than the market price, and people in the cloth industry were optimistic.

Three Factories Formulate Measures for Producing 30,000 Picul of Cooking Oil, Raw Materials Mainly Soybeans and Sesame
In accordance with the new regulations of the Four-Bank Joint Office, the Central Trust Bureau will adopt the production method instead of the old practice of loans to promote the increased production of daily necessities. Previously, relevant parties and representatives of the China Plantation Oil Factory and the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association were convened on the 7th to entrust the factories to produce 30,000 piculs of cooking oil. The raw materials are limited to soybeans, sesame, peanuts, and rapeseed, and detailed rules have been formulated to solicit the opinions of the factories.
It is learned that Zhongtong, Dayouyu, and Dade Xin San have decided on the following methods: (1) The purchasing locations of raw materials are Northeast China for soybeans, Bengbu and Hankou for sesame, Qingdao, Xuzhou, and Kaifeng for peanuts, and Suzhou, Pinghu, and Wuhu for rapeseed. Other goods in this city are also included. (2) Estimated oil yield: 10% for soybeans, 40% for sesame, 38% for peanuts, and 30% for rapeseed. (3) Estimated raw material value: If each kind of oil is extracted for 30,000 piculs, the amount of soybeans is about 70 billion yuan (at market price), sesame is about 3.25 billion yuan, peanuts are about 4.24 billion yuan, and rapeseed is more than 24 billion yuan. (4) Processing fee: 25,000 yuan per picul for soybeans, and 46,000 yuan per picul for other oils that need to be re-extracted, but it will be increased or decreased according to the cost of living index. (5) Raw material allocation: Zhongzhi accounts for half, and the rest is allocated to various factories. (6) Finished product standards must be in accordance with Zhongzhi's past qualified inspection. Regarding the above methods, the above-mentioned factories jointly submitted them to the China Trust Bureau on the 12th.

Stop Purchasing Soybeans in Northeast China
[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] The purchase of soybeans in Northeast China has been stopped. According to the person in charge of the Shenyang Branch of the China Trust Bureau, the China Trust Bureau's purchase of soybeans in Northeast China has been suspended due to the excessively high reserve price and actual difficulties. The previously purchased soybeans were mostly lost in Siping, Kaiyuan, and other places, amounting to more than 14,000 tons. The losses in Shuangmiaozi, Dongfeng, and Xi'an are still impossible to estimate. The 3,000 tons of soybeans that were previously planned to be exported to Japan for barter have been diverted to other uses due to actual needs.

Zhongzhi to Start Oil Distribution This Weekend
In order to prevent the resurgence of the cooking oil price surge, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Zhongzhi Oil Factory has decided to resume the distribution of cooking oil to 600 retail oil shops starting this weekend, with 100 households rotating daily, one barrel per household, weighing three and a half dan, totaling 350 dan. Rapeseed oil will be the first target, and then gradually extend to other oils. The distribution price will be slightly reduced with reference to the market price. According to the recent reasons for the passive oil price, the main raw materials, such as the scarce source of soybeans and the sharp reduction in the number of shipments from Qingdao to Shanghai, coupled with the rampant smuggling of raw oil in South China, have caused the price of raw oil to rise by 20% in one week.

Cotton Now Downstream
Yesterday's current cotton market situation continued to be weak, and transactions were still rare. Yarn factories had loose silver in name but tight in reality, so the appetite was slack. At the same time, the purchase price limit was too low, making it difficult to approach the sellers, so the transaction was silent, and the price was consistently lowered. The prices of various grades of Lingbao store were 1.98 million and 2 million, Fire Machine 1.5 million, and Zhoupu seed flower 287,000.

Cigarettes Reach the Peak
Yesterday's cigarette market situation reached its peak. It was heard that the Yizhong Company's distribution of goods will be managed flexibly according to the market price, and the distribution date may be delayed. Rumors were conducive to buying, demand was even greater, the market atmosphere was激昂, and the market price rose in a straight line.
The result of the midday market was that 10-pack British cigarettes set a new high of 10.85 million yuan, continuing to rise by 550,000 yuan from the previous day. Old Knife brand cigarettes also continued to rise by 550,000 yuan to 8.45 million yuan. The prices of other strip cigarettes from Chinese manufacturers, such as Beauty Golden Mouse, Million Jin, and Cres Red Gold, also rose uniformly, from 500 yuan to 2,4500 yuan. The market prices of American goods such as LG, Camel, and Morris strip cigarettes, and 50-pack canned cigarettes, also rose by 12,000 yuan.

Woolen Cloth is Light
The season has reached the height of summer, and the woolen cloth market is light in all aspects. Especially with the current uncertain environment and high interest rates, hoarding has long disappeared, and transactions are even more deserted than at this time in previous years. The standard market situation, the tea party, is uneven.

Rice Prices Fall in Suzhou
Our newspaper, Suzhou, 12th. Grain prices are trending down today, with top white at 360,000 yuan and coarse japonica at 290,000 yuan. The market situation is good.

Spring and Autumn Nobel Prize for Literature Zhao Jingshen

The Nobel Prize for Literature is the largest of the literary prizes, and has always been valued by international writers. Before the war, two books were published in China specifically discussing this prize:

(1) "The Nobel Prize for Literature and Its Recipients" by Shi Honggao, Mei She, published in 1932 by Renwen Bookstore. Each winner has a biography, up to Karlfeldt in 1931. The false rumor about the Spanish literary critic Bida (R.M.Pidal) in 1932 cannot be counted.

(2) "The Nobel Prize for Literature Winners: Essays on Modern World Writers" by Ms. Yang Jikan and Chen Yisun, published in 1934 by Hanwen Zhengkai Printing House. This book was published later, so it was able to include Galsworthy in 1932 and Browning in 1933.

The author has been writing about world literary news since "Fiction Monthly," and it has been a long time since I put down my pen. Now I am continuing to write for the Spring and Autumn column of the "Shen Bao," and it has been nearly a year. After 1933, I would like to give a brief report on the winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature. Fortunately, I have Anne J. Richeter's "Literary Prizes and Their Winners" compiled last October, so I will write a brief table based on this book:

1934 Pirandello (L. Pirandello)

1935 Not Awarded

1936 O'Neill (Eugene O'Neill)

1937 Martin du Gard (R. Martin du Gard)

1938 Pearl S. Buck (Pearl S. Buck)

1939 Sillanpää (Frans Emil Sillanpää)

1940 to 1943 Not Awarded

1944 Jensen (Johannes V. Jensen)

1945 Mistral (Gabriela Mistral)

1946 Hesse (Hermann Hesse)

Among the above eight writers, Pirandello is an Italian playwright and novelist. Xu Xiacun translated his "Six Characters in Search of an Author." His winning works are "As You Desire Me," "The Outcast," and "Tonight We Improvise." O'Neill is an American playwright, and his winning work is his complete works. Pearl S. Buck is famous for "The Good Earth." I introduced Hesse in this newspaper last year.

Among the four relatively unfamiliar writers, Mistral is from Chile. According to a Central News Agency telegram at the time: "The Swedish Academy announced that the Nobel Prize for Literature for 1945 has been awarded to the Chilean poet, diplomat, and teacher Mistral. This is the first time that a Latin American has won this prize." Note that he taught at Columbia University, and his winning work is "Desolation."

Sillanpää is the most famous modern Finnish novelist, born in 1888. In his early work "Life and the Sun" (Elama Ja Aurinko, 1916), he already showed that he was a rare genius, like an impressionist painter who is good at shadows. The novels "Fallen Asleep While Young" (Fallen iq Asleep While Young, 1931) and "Holy Misery" (Hurskas Kurjuns, 1919) are also well written. Recently, his "Life's Beauty and Pain" (Jhruiselon Jhanuus Ja Kurjuus, 1915) shows that he is still an art master.

Martin du Gard was born in 1881 and is a French novelist and playwright. His family was middle class. He graduated from university in 1906. In 1909, his first novel "Becoming" (Devenirl) was

### General Chen Addresses Northeast Military and Administration: Legal Tender to Circulate Outside the Pass; Headquarters and Political-Economic Committee to Be Abolished

[Our Paper, Shenyang, 12th Dispatch] Chen Cheng's arrival and firm hand in dealing with military and administrative affairs in Pan[yang] have left a good impression on the local people. At the same time, it is generally believed that the Northeast military and administration have begun to improve. Because Chen focuses on winning people's hearts, he is rectifying military discipline and planning to eliminate economic barriers. Regarding the rectification of military discipline, it is said that military departments will be ordered to focus on military affairs and stop running other businesses. In terms of eliminating economic barriers, it is said that they are considering allowing legal tender to circulate outside the pass, turning circulation notes into banknotes similar to Customs Gold Units to prevent the sharp drop in circulation notes. At the same time, the security is good (Northeast only) to reduce the burden on the people of twenty or thirty counties. It is rumored that the two committees, Political and Economic, under the Northeast Headquarters will be abolished, and the large organization will be transformed into a research institution. Northeast veterans in the Political Committee will be given the title of committee member and other similar consultant national titles to facilitate the advancement of government affairs.

[Our Paper, Shenyang, 12th Dispatch] After the Northeast Headquarters expands its organization in the future, in addition to the director, four deputies will be set up first. In addition to Du Yuming and Zheng Dongguo, the other two have not yet been determined. Dong Yingbin will serve as the Chief of Staff, and Dong Yanping and Zhao Jiaxiang will assist him. It is rumored that Zhao will also serve concurrently as the head of the Third Division, and each division will also add one deputy director. After the Northeast Headquarters is closed, its offices will be merged into the headquarters with the same nature, and the surplus personnel will be incorporated into the officer corps for training and then reorganized and placed.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th Dispatch] Chen Cheng received Sun Liren on the evening of the 12th and decided to go to Jinzhou by car on the morning of the 13th for inspection.

[Our Paper, Changchun, 12th Dispatch] The central government has decided to unify the command of Northeast military and administration. The Northeast Security Commander's Headquarters has been ordered to be abolished. The headquarters has been increased and a deputy director has been established, to be held by Mr. Zheng Dongguo. In addition, three pacification offices will be established in Shenyang, Changchun, and Longjiang.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 12th Dispatch] The security in Changchun City has gradually returned to normal, and the surrounding situation is tending to be stable. The Changchun Garrison Headquarters has recently shortened the curfew time from 11:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. the next morning.

[Our Paper, Changchun, 12th Dispatch] Due to rainy weather here, Sun Liren's arrival in Changchun has been postponed to the 13th.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th Dispatch] Sun Liren arrived in Shenyang by plane from Ping[jin] at 1:25 p.m. on the 12th and is scheduled to fly to Changchun on the morning of the 13th.

### General Sun Liren Talks About Recent Developments in Northeast Military Affairs

[United Press, Peiping, 12th Dispatch] General Sun Liren, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army, said that the next offensive by the Communist army in the Northeast may begin "after the end of the rainy season this month." Sun said that the Communist army has acquired the equipment of the elite Japanese Kwantung Army (left by the Soviet army), and its artillery is now stronger than the National army. On the contrary, after the victory in the war against Japan, the New First Army and the New Sixth Army have been unable to obtain replacements for their vehicles and firepower, so they are increasingly feeling the shortage. The same is true for the troops using American equipment in the Northeast. Sun said that at its peak, the artillery strength of the New First Army was only half that of the American army. "We are now unable to replenish consumption and losses. Comparing one division with another, the Communist army's firepower should be equal to ours, if not stronger." Sun estimated that the Communist forces in the Northeast number between 250,000 and 300,000, with 18 regular divisions, each with 8,000 to 9,000 men. As for the number of Communist reserve forces north of the Songhua River, Sun said he could not report. He also said that the government is busy preparing for the next offensive by the Communist army, which will not be long after the end of the rainy season, as the Communist army is eager to prevent the National army from completing its defensive measures. The rainfall in the Northeast accounts for 60% of the annual rainfall in June, July, and August, making the roads muddy and difficult for marching. General Sun does not believe that the Communist army can capture Changchun, Yongji, and Jiyang, because the Communist army does not dare to launch a sustained attack on one place for more than two weeks, causing excessive consumption of manpower. However, the Communist army may break through to the south, encircle cities, and destroy city chains and railways. Sun said that the training plan is quite difficult and must start from scratch by building barracks. Sun explained that China has no second-line forces, so it is necessary to train new troops. According to government statistics, after the reorganization of the National army in 1946, there were 2.9 million people. Sun finally said that after the core organization is completed, it will still take at least a year and a half to train a division of troops.

After Foreign Minister Wang reported on foreign affairs and Minister Bai reported on national defense, discussions were held, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Diplomatic envoys to Sweden will be mutually upgraded. (2) Tang Enbo, who concurrently serves as the Commander of the Garrison of the Capital, should be relieved of his concurrent post, and the vacancy will be filled by Zhang Zong, who will also serve concurrently as the Commander of the Military Police.

At today's meeting, a wide-ranging review was conducted on the issue of adjusting the salaries of civil servants and military personnel, but no concrete decision was reached, and a lot of time was spent, so other cases could not be discussed. It was decided to convene a special meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 13th to continue discussions.

[Our Paper, Nanking, 12th Dispatch] Regarding the adjustment of civil servants' salaries, the Executive Yuan held a routine meeting on the morning of the 12th, and a detailed discussion was held.

After the salary increase, the national treasury's expenditure will increase by about 2 trillion yuan. This matter must await the final decision of the 9th State Council meeting on the 15th.

### UNRRA Supplies to Communist Areas: We Have Made Concrete Representations; We Cannot Guarantee the Safety of UNRRA Personnel

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 12th Dispatch] UNRRA previously announced that it would suspend the transportation of relief supplies to Northeast and North China from July 28, and suggested that the Chinese government (1) not consider Yantai as a "blockaded port" under the laws of war for a certain number of weeks in August and September so that UNRRA supply ships could enter Yantai; (2) transport 27,000 tons of supplies into Communist-controlled areas from Tianjin along the Grand Canal within two weeks with extremely rapid action. UNRRA also stated that this recommendation would expire on the 15th, hoping to obtain a satisfactory decision and guarantee from our government. Since UNRRA's recommendation was announced in Washington, UNRRA China Office Director Cleveland and CNRRA Director Huo Baoshu have consulted with relevant authorities on this matter. Now the deadline of the 15th has already passed. It is learned that our government has made concrete representations, which have been handed over to CNRRA for forwarding to the UNRRA China Office. Although it is not easy to find out the details, according to reporters' speculation, our government is afraid that it cannot guarantee the safety of UNRRA and CNRRA staff in the current war zone and Communist-controlled areas, but in certain areas designated by the government, relief supplies can still be transported to Communist areas. As for the people in the Communist areas who have suffered for a long time, the government is extremely concerned and eagerly hopes that UNRRA supplies can truly reach the hands of the people in the Communist areas. If it does not contradict the above-mentioned purpose of relieving the people, the government will not oppose the transportation of supplies to the Communist areas. [Our Paper News] According to sources in CNRRA, Director Dong of the Information Office of the Executive Yuan will make a second formal statement regarding UNRRA's suspension of relief supplies to North China.

### After CNRRA is Concluded, a Rehabilitation Committee Will Be Established

CNRRA drafts a plan and submits it for approval

[Our Paper, Nanking, 12th Dispatch] As CNRRA and UNRRA are about to conclude, the issue of continuing their operations has reached a decision time. According to reliable sources, CNRRA has accepted UNRRA's suggestion that various relief supplies are donated by member states of the United Nations, and its operations are different from ordinary post-war relief. Therefore, an additional organization should be established to transport the relief supplies that will continue to arrive to benefit our disaster-stricken people. CNRRA has also drafted a plan to establish a Post-War Rehabilitation Committee based on this principle and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for review. The Post-War Rehabilitation Committee will be directly under the Executive Yuan, and several offices will be set up under it to carry out operations. For the reconstruction work in the Yellow River flood area, the Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan Yellow River Flood Area Reconstruction Bureau will be established immediately. This plan has been submitted to a group for review by the Executive Yuan and will be finalized within a month.

### No Fear of Famine in China's Food-Deficient Areas This Year

Cleveland Releases China Food Report

[Our Paper News] UNRRA China Office Director Cleveland publicly stated in his China Food Report yesterday that there is no fear of famine in southern Hunan and other less dangerous food-deficient areas this year. One of the main reasons is the timely supply of food by UNRRA and CNRRA. The improvement in Hunan's harvest this year is attributed to the following reasons: (1) The damage suffered during the War of Resistance has gradually recovered; (2) The food supply from UNRRA and CNRRA during the transition period; (3) UNRRA's assistance to farmers in increasing production by providing seeds and agricultural tools. However, it is estimated that 100,000 people in Hunan still need food relief this year. Now that the autumn harvest is in sight, and UNRRA and CNRRA are rapidly supplying food to food-deficient areas from 50 distribution stations, the serious situation has been alleviated. As for the food situation in other provinces, it can be briefly described as follows: In Guangdong, 10,000 tons of food have been supplied for emergency relief after the floods, half for emergency relief and half for work relief. In Guangxi, UNRRA recently received reports that the 5,000 tons of food pre-stored are enough to meet the needs of disaster relief. There are no signs of large-scale famine in other possible food-deficient areas, such as northern Fujian, Henan, Hebei, Rehe, and Andong. Anhui had a very good spring harvest, with surplus for preventing famine. Jiangsu also had a good spring wheat harvest, but there have been recent floods, so UNRRA and CNRRA have paid attention to it. Shandong had a poor spring harvest, and UNRRA and CNRRA have pre-stored sufficient food to prepare for relief, but there is currently no action due to the suspension of relief supplies in North China.

### Once a Wasteland, Now a Green Field: A New Atmosphere in the Yellow River Flood Area; 20,000 Tons of Food Can Be Harvested This Year

[Our City News] CNRRA News: Reconstruction work in the Yellow River Flood Area of Henan began in April this year, and more than 400,000 refugees have returned home in an endless stream. According to the personnel of the Yellow River Flood Area Inspection Team led by CNRRA Director Huo Baoshu, "When Director Huo led the UNRRA inspection team to conduct in-depth investigations in the flood area in April this year, what they saw was a wasteland. At that time, it was boundless, the earth was grayish-yellow, and there were no plants. This time, the CNRRA special plane flew low over the flood area in Xihua, Fugou, Zhoujiakou, and Taikang in Henan, and saw that most of the land was green squares, and crops were growing. Since this spring, CNRRA's main work in the flood area has been 'investment' in agriculture. The refugees who returned home were all impoverished and had nothing. The materials that UNRRA transported to the flood area were a large number of seeds, flour, and hand-held agricultural tools. This material, combined with the hard-working spirit of the refugees, created green squares on the land. The spring tillage area accounted for 70% of the land in the flood area, and there is great confidence in harvesting 20,000 tons of food this year. There are a total of 200 American plows in the Henan flood area, which are used to cultivate the land. The soil in the flood area is covered with thick sand, and it is impossible to cultivate without mechanical plowing. During this low-altitude inspection, famous playwright Cao Yu and Zhang Junxiang were also on the plane and were very interested in the miracle of farming in the flood area. The two have stayed in Henan and have not returned, preparing to take a long trip in the flood area for further investigation."

[Another News] The flood in northern Jiangsu this time was due to the flooding of the Yi and Zhong Canal, but the Huai River, which must have flooded in previous years, was safe and sound under the protection of the newly built river embankment. CNRRA allocated a total of 14,500 tons of work food to the Huai Embankment, which proves that human power can ultimately control nature.
