### Art and Social Life

— Pan Gongzhan

Society's needs are upward and forward progress, and only art can create this kind of driving force; the need of life lies in cultivation of truth and beauty and stops at the ultimate good, and only art can educate the human spirit to develop in this direction of truth, beauty, and goodness.  The use of art to cultivate life and promote society depends entirely on the creativity and effort of artists. Contemporary master painter Liu Haisu embraces the determination to take art as his life, avoids no difficulties, spares no effort, relying only on his transcendent talent, noble personality, and extraordinary perseverance, engaging in the creation and effort of art and art education for forty years as if it were a single day, creating the authority of the Chinese art world and establishing the foundation of national art education.

I still remember when Mr. Haisu was ordered to go abroad, traveling in Europe for three years, his reputation filled foreign countries, winning infinite glory for the Chinese art world. After returning to Shanghai in the 21st year, the Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to promote art and encourage writers, held a solo exhibition for Mr. Haisu at the Lake Society Yingshi Memorial Hall. At that time, Mr. Cai Yuanpei also wrote an inscription saying:

"Mr. Liu Haisu has a profound family background, widely browsed ancient famous works, especially close to the Southern Song Dynasty, letting his brush go, not rigidly adhering to the likeness of form, but taking vivid spirit as the standard.  And when he also studies oil painting, he is not restricted by the painting school factions of various European countries; but radiates colors, expresses individuality, and has the spirit of forming his own style...'"

Mr. Cai knew Mr. Haisu very well, so his words were more sincere; as seen by our Chinese people, we also have the same feeling. Because the artist's creation is the expression of his spirit, the display of talent, the reflection of personality, and the expression of perseverance, Mr. Haisu's works are not only free from the constraints of one school or faction, but also keep pace with the times, so his thoughts and spirit also constantly step into new realms along with his era. It proves that the value of art is not only in depicting images for people to appreciate; but the greater meaning lies in promoting society, cultivating life, improving culture, and promoting the true essence of truth, beauty, and goodness in the universe.

After seeing Mr. Haisu's recent works, the style is superb, the spirit is magnificent, entering seriousness from unrestrainedness, and not losing unrestrainedness in seriousness, which is especially commendable! It shows the abundance of creativity and a deeper understanding of the great value of Chinese art.  Here, I would like to wish Mr. Haisu even more brilliant achievements in the future; and also hope that the modern Chinese art world will have a shared, brilliant, and great future!

### Hai Su and His Works

— Gu Shusen

Haisu and I have known each other for nearly forty years. In the early years of the Republic of China, Haisu founded the Art Academy (now the Shanghai Art College) in West Shanghai. At that time, we often visited each other and regarded each other as confidants. I participated in every art exhibition, and always saw his best works first. Haisu managed this school with careful planning. Over the decades, he has achieved remarkable results. To this day, it is difficult to count those in the art world who serve society under his tutelage. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, I went to Europe to study education, and Haisu argued with warlords and pedantic Confucian scholars of the world over the model case. Since then, Haisu's name has become increasingly prominent, and Haisu's paintings have also improved day by day. For a time, opponents criticized him as a traitor to art, and he also called himself that. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, I returned to China from Europe. The following year, Haisu was sent by the Ministry of Education to Europe to investigate art, visiting France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany to study the schools of art and the changes in history. In three years, he wrote more than two hundred excellent works, which were twice selected for the French Autumn Salon, and then specially invited to exhibit at the Tuileries Salon. For a time, Paris regarded him as a giant in the Chinese art world and held an exhibition of his works in Europe at the house of Mr. Wenhaolai Lu'a (professor at the University of Paris), who personally wrote the preface, praising him as a master of the Chinese Renaissance. His masterpiece "Snow in Luxembourg" was purchased by the French government and collected by the Etherbaum National Art Museum. Haisu is the first Chinese whose Western paintings have been collected by French art museums. This is not only an honor for Haisu personally, but also the glory of the country.

Painting not only expresses the individual's personality, but also transforms the culture of an era. Painting is not only about depicting nature and striving for a complete likeness of form, but also about the expression of the whole personality. All the life activity of the spirit, the life activity of thought, is expressed in the painting beyond the form, and this active spirit can reveal its great personality. Moreover, the expression of this internal spirit often evokes external responses, so the paintings of famous artists often move people and enable the spirit of the reader to come into contact with the spirit of the author. Therefore, in an era, if there is a great artist, it can have a great impact on social culture, enough to advocate the academic thought of an era, small enough to inspire future generations, and become a master of an era. Just like the Renaissance in Europe, artists emerged in large numbers and were the pioneers of modern culture. In this sense, painting has value; in this sense, art feels precious.

Haisu's paintings have a superior style and great spirit. There is life in them, which is enough to express his great personality. Therefore, reading his books can reveal his character. He can disregard the worship of the secular world and resolutely devote himself to new life. The revelation of his emotions is enough to arouse future scholars and open up new paths in the art world. After this, the atmosphere changed and he became a great master of an era. His influence may even extend to culture, so Haisu's contribution cannot be ignored.

### On Reading Hai Su's Paintings, A Poem

— Ye Gongchuo

Hundreds of rivers flow eastwards, donating their streams;
Ten thousand tributaries come westwards, offering tributes.
Who with the midstream becomes a pillar of strength?
Yet pity my Dao, belonging to the vast continent.
Between the lines, intention is hard to conceive ingenuity,
Beyond objects, far-reaching thoughts ultimately uncollected;
Truly, this is a fine piece of uncut jade,
In cinnabar and azure, divine transformations let the pursuit be.

### On Hai Su

— Jiang Danshu

Painting is divided into Chinese and Western, but the principles are the same. Chinese painting emphasizes brush and ink: the so-called use of brush is like the brushstrokes of Western painting. The so-called use of ink is like the color tones of Western painting. Therefore, if a writer can be proficient in both Chinese and Western styles, the appearance of his works will be different, and the charm he discovers will be perfect. There are not many writers in the world who are proficient in both Chinese and Western styles, and my friend Haisu can be called a master. Haisu has a high talent and a strong personality; he first studied Western painting and liked to use emphasized lines and colors, and he can express his self-personality everywhere. When you look at his paintings, you don't need to see his signature to recognize them as Haisu's paintings. The same is true when he later studied Chinese painting. I think that Tang people often took scenery from nature. The so-called taking creation as a teacher means that their composition is often similar to today's Western paintings, so they feel that the interest of nature and the interest of brush and ink are both lush. The Song people's interest in brush and ink has gradually become greater than the interest in nature. After the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, they paid more attention to the interest in brush and ink, and even submerged the interest in nature. The reason for this is that they are far away from nature. If you don't look at the works of the Ming and Qing people, you will often see their signatures saying, "Imitating the brush of so-and-so." It is precisely because Haisu first studied Western painting that he carried a paint box and an easel and traveled through real mountains and rivers for many years, cultivating a broad mind and sensitive hands and eyes: once he studied Chinese painting, he could get great help. Moreover, he has seen many famous works on weekdays, and he has also made decisions on the top, so he can inherit the past and usher in the present, and form his own style. This is called a work with life. Its life is Haisu's spirit, not the old clothes of other dead people. I have been painting for forty years, although I have achieved nothing, but I have also advanced in both Chinese and Western styles, following the same path. Therefore, I deeply know that Western painting can help Chinese painting, and I also know that the style of writers who are proficient in both Chinese and Western styles must be different from those who are only proficient in one. This is the new trend of modern style. Before the Republic of China, there was no such example. Since painting can be used to judge an era, this is the characteristic of this era's judgment, and it can be recognized as a new category without waiting for future generations to see it. Because I watched Haisu's painting exhibition, Chinese and Western styles were juxtaposed and reflected each other, with two faces and one spirit, so I discussed it.

### Peony and Green Leaves

— Lu Xiaoman

The painting exhibition of Grand Master Liu, which I have been eagerly awaiting, will be held on the 21st. This is an exhibition that we should appreciate. Among Chinese painters, only Grand Master Liu can paint both Chinese and Western paintings well at the same time. He began by focusing solely on Western painting. His Western painting is not only appreciated by Chinese people, but also admired by many Western painters in Europe. I remember that Zhimo wrote a very long article in those years about how European painters recognized and praised the Grand Master's paintings! Later, after he returned to China, he devoted himself to studying Chinese painting. He personally collected many famous ancient paintings, all of which are masterpieces. Because he has innate intelligence, he soon grasped the mysteries of them, and the paintings he painted were both elegant and profound, with a majestic spirit, and a kind of indescribable greatness? I am a junior scholar, and I dare not comment on them casually, or talk nonsense about the good and bad. Fortunately, there is a public opinion.

I only feel one thing, that our Grand Master's character is really a rare talent among painters; he not only closes his doors and paints at home, but he also has the talents of a diplomat and a politician. He can do what others dare not do to the outside world, and he can say what others dare not say, just like when the Japanese were looking for him when the South Seas Islands were lost, he was able to deal with them in a very calm manner, using his eloquence to win, and the Japanese did not dare to arrange him casually. He showed toughness in silence and never softened, so later the Japanese respected him and bowed their heads. In the end, they had no choice but to politely send him back to Shanghai by plane; this attitude is really admirable.

Also, he is not afraid of difficulties and external blows when he does things. If he wants to do it, he must do it. He has great creativity. For art, he is willing to sacrifice anything. The Shanghai Art College can have today's achievements. He doesn't know how much energy and money he has spent; sometimes he has to endure external criticism, but he can ignore everything and resolutely use his consistent style to do it to the end; that's why he has today's success.

Recently, his progress in Chinese painting has been even more amazing. This painting exhibition will definitely have many unexpected good paintings, and also his wife's works! This is the most rare thing. Although she has lived in Nanyang for a long time and has received advanced Western education, she has always loved Chinese culture; especially calligraphy, she must write a piece of calligraphy every morning before doing other things, so her calligraphy is very skilled, beautiful and simple, and has a masculine spirit, which is really a rare masterpiece. Sometimes Haisu paints a good painting and adds a long inscription from his wife, which makes the peony and green leaves even more beautiful. I dare not continue to write more, but I heard that his couple has this grand event, so I scribbled a few words to wish them well and tell the comrades in Shanghai who love art not to miss the opportunity.

### Letter to Hai Su

— Liang Shoudai

Haisu: Your art has reached a mature stage. In other words, your paintings have progressed from groping to firmness, from relying to creating; and, at the moment of spiritual satisfaction, from the impulse and worship of power to the conquest and realization of power. This sounds a little strange, right? … I don't need to explain. I believe that the audience this time, as long as they have a certain understanding of art, as long as they pay a little attention and think, will naturally get such an impression.

Sometimes I think: the inspiration of writing and the maturity of art are very wonderful things, and it is even more wonderful to use "once you get through, everything is connected" to describe this realm. A talented artist gropes, explores, and studies in the dark, one year, ten years… Suddenly, look? At the turning point, a vast and boundless sky appeared on the head, and dazzling valleys and plains appeared at the bottom of the eyes. Don’t we often have this feeling when climbing between towering peaks? This is no different from ripe fruit: we watch it turn from green to yellow, from yellow to red, but we never see any movement. One day, we don’t pay attention, but it suddenly falls—no different; but it is the difference between conscious and unconscious. Or, to be more accurate, one is the will of nature, the power of the sun; the other is the will of the artist, the power of the spirit. At this time, the artist's creative power is like a hot furnace, melting all kinds of iron and pure gold into one. Therefore, literary and artistic creation is not as new and ingenious an invention as most people imagine, but a constant effort and infinite patience in exchange for the natural and reasonable development of the future; therefore, there is only evolution and no revolution in literary and artistic history; no matter how ambitious you are to open up the world, unless you connect to the source of tradition, you can only open rootless flowers and bear seedless fruits, which will wither and rot before the end of the day. Not to mention those who are determined to be different or stubbornly resist the current. … Power, needless to say, is your painting emblem, your painting is the incarnation of power. Whether you are a connoisseur or a layman, once you see your painting, you will be swept into the vortex of that moving and powerful force. I don't want to repeat the common truths that are obvious to all: what you paint is the light of the setting sun, the height of the mountains, the turbulence of the waves, the strength of the lions, the fierce luan of the eagles, the vigor of the pines, the bright red of the cockscomb flowers… However, this only speaks of your subject matter, your temperament, the longing of your soul and the elements of your spirit. Regarding this level, Guo Moruo, a new poet, shares it with you to some extent. It is also natural for the general audience to compare your paintings to his poems, but when it comes to art (Moruo has to give way on this point), the so-called power is not only the grandeur of the subject matter, the liveliness of the lines, the intensity of the colors, and the unrestrained composition; but also the internal freedom and relocation in order to achieve the balance and concentration of expression. …

I believe that your continuous efforts will definitely have greater gains. Now, you can put all the degrees of right and wrong aside, because... you have created something with life.

Note: Yesterday I accidentally read Mr. Zongdai's handwriting, in which several paragraphs - commenting on Mr. Haisu's paintings, were very pertinent. From this letter, we can see Mr. Liang's own learning and also know his friendship with Mr. Haisu. I arbitrarily interrupted and excerpted it and published it without obtaining consent. I think Mr. Liang will not blame me for being meddlesome, right? (Excerpted by Liu Shi)

### On Liu Haisu and His Art

— Wen Zhaotong

Mr. Liu Haisu, he is already fifty-two years old this year, but his spirit is still young. Otherwise, how could we have so many magnificent and unpretentious large compositions to see today.

When Mr. Liu was twenty-four years old, the progressive intellectuals in China were in the midst of the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement. He stood at the avant-garde of new art to participate in this struggle, because eight years before the "May Fourth" Movement, Mr. Liu had already built the fortress of new art—the Shanghai Drawing and Art Academy, the predecessor of today's Shanghai Art College. What is most worth mentioning at this time is "model as an art traitor.

Mr. Liu's anti-feudal ideas were misunderstood. At the age of sixteen, he expressed them by quietly leaving his family and coming to Shanghai to establish the Drawing and Art Academy. After the agitation of the "May Fourth" Movement, and during the era when Sun Chuanfang occupied five provinces, he did not hesitate to risk his own life to fight with such a violent warlord for the "model" issue that had been suppressed by feudal forces for ten years. Finally, he stubbornly overcame this.

If we want to thoroughly understand Mr. Liu's character, the best evidence is his art. Because, in his exploration and pursuit of art, the guides and companions he cited are the old man Qingxiang, who is full of spirit and has a broad mind in Chinese national art; as for the entire history of Western art, the spirits of Michelangelo, Delacroix, Monet, Van Gogh, and Cezanne are in tune with him. Therefore, whether he uses ink, rice paper, yellow ocher, vermilion, ultramarine, or emerald green oil paint, he always expresses his character in this way. In fact, this is Mr. Liu's eternal creation. On the negative side, Mr. Liu has opposed the stubbornness and inferiority of academic art, and the stereotypes and weakness of academy painting. This can be said to be another piece of evidence against feudal forces.

Mr. Liu's spirit is always young, and so is the creation in art.

### Viewing Mr. Hai Su's Painting Exhibition

— Zhao Qingge

The task of an artist is not only to depict nature and strive for a complete likeness of form. In other words, a great artist is also a thinker and scholar, and should shoulder the responsibility of promoting the culture of the times. A sublime work of art has a sacred power that can have a great impact on society. It not only expresses the scholarship and thought of the time, but also is enough to inspire future generations; even for eternity. Therefore, a great artist must not only cater to the demands of the world, but also reverse worldly concepts and produce serious works.

China is an ancient country of fine arts. Her fine arts have a special style and form. After thousands of years of evolution, although it has been infected with a lot of Western flavors, it has always maintained its traditional essence. In other words, it has not only been subverted by Western fine arts, but also has recognized and transformed Western fine arts. Since the Republic of China, fine arts, like other cultures, has stirred up a revolutionary upsurge, changed its old appearance, abandoned the ivory tower, stood in front of the times, and shook hands with reality, until today.

Mr. Liu Hailai, who has made pioneering contributions in the history of Chinese fine arts, everything about him does not need me to elaborate. Everyone is familiar with it. Here, I will only introduce a few words about my feelings after encountering his works:

The impression that Mr. Haisu's Chinese and Western skills gave me before the war was boldness, dates, strength, and group wildness. This has its unique features. However, it is inevitable that it is a little too fiery.

After ten years of separation, in the war, Mr. Haisu cultivated his mind and nurtured his character, and worked tirelessly on the production of fine arts and reading. Therefore, his Chinese painting has surprisingly reached perfection. Whether he paints a grass, a tree, a mountain, or a river, he fully expresses the poetic interest in his hot and practiced skills. Several large-scale works, such as "Fisherman's Picture" and "Snow Accumulation in Cold Rock", although overflowing with the atmosphere of Song and Yuan painters, the style of Fan Kuan and Zhu Duan; but its grand and transcendent artistic conception, exquisite and flexible brushwork, outstanding ancient and clumsy layout, pure and mellow ink rhyme, can simply sweep away the mediocrity and restraint of Chinese fine arts for two hundred years, and form its own school. From this, we know that the genius and cultivation of an artist will eventually be extraordinary. Conversely, if you only have talent and lack cultivation, no matter how skilled your skills are, but you lack achievements in the realm, your works will suffer from anemia and cannot be appreciated by the audience, and are not enough to be passed down through the ages!

In today's prevailing painting exhibitions, following Mr. Zhang Daqian, Mr. Haisu wants to make his exquisite masterpieces known to the world, which can save the declining trend and correct the perception! Because China has always paid little attention to art education, which has led to the extremely shallow appreciation of art among the people. If we want to improve their appreciation level, artists must solemnly present their works, be responsible for themselves, and be responsible for history. Isn't this also a way to promote art education! ‘This is a difficult task.

### Historical Examples of Currency Inflation

— Heizi

The inauspicious term "currency inflation" is a headache for everyone. From high prices, from the unemployed, from the recession, we will think of currency inflation, and blame it on currency inflation. According to general estimates, the amount of legal tender issued is probably between 25 trillion and 30 trillion, which is much better than Germany in the First World War and Hungary in the Second World War.

During the First World War, Germany issued 518,000,000,000,000,000,000 marks, that is, 51.8 million trillion marks, an increase of 86.3 billion trillion compared to the pre-war issue of 6 billion in 1914.

The economic collapse caused by this kind of inflation has frightened many people, but Hungary after the Second World War was even more impressive.

The amount issued reached 76,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, a number of thirty-eight digits.

The numbers generally used for payment in transactions are not ten thousand, nor one hundred million, but one trillion trillion, or even one hundred million trillion. Therefore, the commercial idiom "different prices in the morning and evening markets" is no longer needed. It is simply different every quarter of an hour and every hour.

But just like Germany's success in reforming the currency system, Hungary's Pongo was also completely reformed more than a year ago. The new currency, Florin, issued only 200 million, and it completely recovered the issuance of this thirty-eight-digit number. One new Florin was exchanged for as much as 400,000 trillion trillion Pongo. One digit was exchanged for thirty digits. This is really a mathematical and economic miracle.

Now our 12,000 yuan of legal tender can still be exchanged for one US dollar at the legal price. It takes a thirty-digit number to exchange for one US dollar. In this way, we don't have to worry too much about our legal tender. Even Hungary's hyperinflation can be rescued. It is even easier for us to enter a favorable situation. As long as the whole country strives to embark on the smooth road of peace and construction, it can promote its realization. The so-called new currency (such as the legendary Sun Coin, etc.) may only need to be converted by five digits and one digit.

But on the other hand, if the national finances are still made up by issuing, then the geometric accumulation of the issued numbers may also increase from fourteen digits to twenty digits, and then to thirty digits. Therefore, the plan for today is to balance the national budget first, then talk about stability, and then talk about reorganization and reform.

### Save the Children's Brains

— Ding Wen

Recently, the newspaper reported that a female reporter visited George Bernard Shaw. She asked the 91-year-old writer the question: "If you were given the opportunity to go through ten years of school life again, would you be willing to go to this school?" The old man did not directly answer, but asked the female reporter: "Suppose a prisoner has finished the hard labor that the judge sentenced him to, would he be willing to do hard labor again?" At first, the female reporter was confused, because this felt like a horse and cow were unrelated. Gradually, she found out that this old man was opposed to the current elementary school education system to the death. He declared that when he was in school, he used "resolute idleness" to preserve this brain. Whenever he was in boring geography or natural history classes, he secretly read novels to get through this painful time. He also opposed this kind of examination method, where the teacher asks questions and the student must answer according to the teacher's intention to get full marks. The female reporter then asked: "In this case, is it a complete failure to run children's education?" The startled old man replied angrily: "Yes, this is simply a big scam of wisdom and morality. A reasonable teaching system may be realized in fifty years."

### Really Don't Understand?

British judge: "You should be fined five pounds."

French criminal (frequently shaking his head to indicate incomprehension, and speaking in French): "What? What are you saying?"

Bystander (in French): "You should be fined ten pounds, understand?"

Criminal (angrily): "Nonsense! The judge clearly said five pounds."

### Hunger Envelops Europe

— Bao Zhongqi

This is a report by Arthur Rostin, a reporter for the American magazine *Fortune*, after traveling around post-war Europe.

I didn't expect to have any joy on this trip around Europe, and I imagined that Europe would not be a beautiful sight. Every city I arrived in, except for Paris and Rome, was devastated, the traces of war still visible, truly heartbreaking! What I couldn't bear to see the most was the sight of people starving, but what came into my view was all starving people. In all the countries I traveled, it can be said that no one could eat their fill.

In Naples, Italy, I saw tattered housewives lining up in long queues waiting for food rations, their trembling hands clutching lira (Italian currency) and ration cards, hoping to exchange them for just a few ounces of dried fish. In Frankfurt (Germany), men and women were like scavengers, digging through piles of garbage for discarded cans, looking for scraps of food. Residents of London were more willing to queue up to buy horse meat.

When I was having lunch in Paris, a Frenchman said to me that what he spent on this meal was more than what they earned in a week! What horrified me was that the residents of Berlin lived in underground cellars, most days without water, electricity, or gas, the houses without heating, and the drinking water completely unusable. I heard a young German say, "While we are alive, Berlin probably won't be rebuilt!"

The second generation of children is growing up in this cold and hungry Europe, receiving nothing more than meager rations in terms of clothing and food. The British are considered the luckiest to receive a clothing ration once every three years.

But what displeased me the most was the universal decline in the moral standards of Europe. No one expects a future, and people greedily seek food, let alone entertainment. Pride and self-esteem have long been lost. The only common phenomenon is theft and begging.

Traveling around Europe is no longer easy or enjoyable. The hotels are full, transportation is still difficult, all the stores are empty, and prices are rising sharply. The entire atmosphere of Europe is unhealthy, with both material and moral illnesses. Today, Europe needs help!

What about China? We hope that the reporter from *Fortune* magazine can also come to China for a "detailed" trip and bring some footage back home.

### Idle Chat on Cartoons

— Cao Xin

Although cartoons are a type of drawing, there are significant differences between them and other drawings. Other drawings, whether Chinese or Western paintings, are merely reflections of the author's thoughts and the surrounding environment. Aside from providing artistic appreciation, they rarely serve other purposes. Cartoons, on the other hand, must also serve the purpose of expressing one's will and improving others' perspectives. Therefore, cartoons also have "educational" value.

To create a cartoon that possesses the characteristics it should have is certainly not an easy task, but a painting that lacks the educational significance mentioned above is like a soulless shell, so there's no point in discussing its value.

There are many ways to construct a cartoon image, and the most commonly adopted is "satire," which certainly has its merits. However, complaining like Ah Q doesn't seem to be desirable. The influence of modern life on the author's psychology is the biggest reason for this, but I think the thinking of someone dedicated to art should not be so narrow, because that would be like destroying your own future!

I am someone who likes cartoons, so I sincerely hope that all artists will put more "heat" into your works. Even though it is summer, people are shivering and can no longer withstand the destruction of "depression."

Drama Translation

### "Peking Man"

— Ma Gao

This is a delicate and complex depiction of the remnants of old Chinese society, a black scar on feudal ethical and moral civilization. With a strong desire for freedom, the author ruthlessly uncovers it, exposing its hateful face as it continues to wreak havoc in human life. It encourages victims to dare to hate, dare to love, and dare to touch the true lives of people.

Here, the author lists the various images of the ghosts of the old society—the decrepit Old Master Zeng, dreaming of reviving his family's glory, struggling in his twilight years, and his unfilial children and grandchildren, only concerned with pleasing him. At the same time, in this hopeless and dark rat's nest, new hope is injected—the anthropologist Yuan Rengan and his daughter, and the simple, native, and lovable characters of the "Peking Man" model and Xiao Zhu'er. They are used to illustrate how the descendants raised under the inhuman education of a family of poets and scholars are so useless and pitiful.

We admire the author's pure and profound writing, rigorous structure, and exquisite character portrayal, which is truly unmatched. However, it is pale and bloodless, not very healthy, and lacks substantial vitality. It only offers a vague hope for improving life. What should those friends who jump out of this circle do? How should they do it? A series of question marks are left for the audience to pursue. The author does not provide a concrete representation of a new life, so it only lets us appreciate the technique, hate the civilization, and ridicule the ethical and moral principles.

The director here is unusually consistent with the author's requirements, conveying the various aspects of the old family life plainly and appropriately. The arrangement of the atmosphere, the rhythm of the segments, and the distribution of positions are all carefully and systematically designed.

However, we are not very satisfied with most of the actors here. Of course, Ye Zi's Zeng Siyi is quite good, but the other characters are somewhat disappointing. Geng Zhen's Wen Qing, as well as Zeng Ting, Rui Zhen, Jiang Tai, and Wen Cai, all lack the elegance and refinement of a son of a noble family. Even the choice of body types is inappropriate. Shen Yang's Old Master Zeng has a very good appearance, but some scenes are too slow, while others are rushed. For example, the scene where he kneels down after discovering that Wen Qing is still smoking opium is perfunctory and neglected. Lin Yun's Nurse Chen has a very honest and kind appearance, but if she were a little more "pure," it would be even better.

### Postal Envelopes

— Zhong Zhi

The Postal Authorities Might Consider

It was reported in the newspaper: A person in charge of the post office stated: "The thirty-eight-yuan stamp is a waste for the repaired society, a consumption for the postal pool, and a trouble for the sender. It can be abolished and replaced with a new method."

I believe that postal envelopes are much better than stamps and are worth considering by the postal authorities.

A postal envelope is a combination of an envelope and a stamp. The post office prepares the envelope and adds a stamp-like imprint in an appropriate position. This saves a lot of paper and glue for the whole society, reduces a batch of unnecessary consumption for the postal authorities, and reduces a lot of trouble for the sender.

A postal stamp can be used more than once; a postal envelope cannot.

Postal stamps can be pasted haphazardly, causing trouble for the cancellation staff; postal envelopes do not have this problem.

Private envelopes vary in size and are easily lost during delivery; postal envelopes can be standardized in size, making them more convenient for packaging and delivery.

Private envelopes can be printed with the name of a business or a private name; postal envelopes can also do this. Postal envelopes can use colors to distinguish the types of letters, making the sorting work much easier; stamps cannot.

The selling price of postal envelopes will certainly be greater than that of stamps, but senders always need envelopes. If fees can be reasonably increased, it is likely to benefit both parties and be welcomed by everyone.

Therefore, I believe that the postal authorities should consider postal envelopes when they consider the burden of a thirty-eight-yuan stamp to be too heavy. The royalty statements for the first half of June have been issued. The following authors are requested to send their mailing addresses: Yuan Zhang, Bo Sheng, Yu Jing, Gu Jiafeng, Hu, Wu Ti, Chen Zhong Sheng.

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

"Uncle Zhu, is there any water left?" Fei Fei suddenly seemed to wake up and said in a weak voice.

"Yes, yes, yes," Old Zhu hurriedly stopped and took out the half-small bottle of water left from his left pocket.

Fei Fei drank it all at once.

When Old Zhu's hand touched her skin, her frightening high fever made his heart feel like it was about to jump out of his chest.

He threw away the empty water bottle, picked up Fei Fei again, and hurried on his way.

"Uncle Zhu, why don't you... sing...?" Fei Fei made this very strange request in his arms.

"Didn't you always say that Uncle Zhu's old tune was unpleasant?" Old Zhu was secretly pleased, thinking that her mind had cleared, and her illness might be turning around.

"Sing, sing!" She urged in a very short voice.

"5111, 5271, 5444, 321712..." Old Zhu moistened his dry lips with the tip of his tongue and gently began to play according to her wishes. In the quiet and deep wilderness at night, the sound was quite clear.

"Is it good, Fei Fei?" After finishing the song, he lowered his head and asked gently.

Fei Fei seemed to nod her head, but her head began to arch backward again, and at the same time, her breathing became more rapid.

"Fei Fei, how do you feel? Are you better?" Old Zhu's heart turned cold again. He knew that she had obviously not escaped the danger period, and his skills were exhausted. In the dark night and desolate wilderness, what method could he think of? He could only keep walking and keep asking like this, while Fei Fei only replied with a groan.

The faint starlight shone like pity on Zhu Zhaonian, who was rushing desperately on the dirt road, exhausted and at his wits' end. His panting and Fei Fei's groaning seemed to have merged into one, and it was no longer possible to distinguish whether it was Old Zhu panting or Fei Fei groaning.

His sweat-drenched limbs had reached the point where they could no longer obey the commands of his nerves. As he approached Nandan, a small county town, he almost tripped over the stones on the road four or five times. He knew that he would not be able to support it for much longer, but he still gritted his teeth and struggled forward step by step. The one policeman and the few vendors still remaining on the street late at night watched with great curiosity as a young man with a broken appearance and a face full of dust, carrying a terribly heavy girl, ran wildly, looking around as if he were looking for something.
