### The National Army Achieves Initiative, The Battle Situation in Jiaodong Will Be Decided Soon, Clearing the Remaining Communist Troops in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway

[Our Newspaper Jinan, 6th Dispatch] Fierce battles are raging in Weixian and the outer suburbs of Qingdao on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway. The Communist forces have been increasing without end. Including more than 20,000 men who landed at various ports in Jiaodong from Dalian at the beginning of the month and moved south, the total has increased to seven divisions, six garrison brigades, and eighteen independent regiments, totaling approximately 170,000 men, among them Gaomi. In the areas of yesterday's mountains, the National Army, facing overwhelming numerical inferiority, inflicted heavy losses on the Communist forces and then voluntarily abandoned them on the morning of the 5th and moved to favorable areas to continue fighting. Outside Weixian, the Kuomintang and Communist forces are still fighting at Changle, Changyi, and Dongwangsong Railway Station in Xiamatun, with no changes in the positions. As for the foreign forces outside Qingdao, after the Communist troops who attacked Jimo were repelled, they attempted to attack again with reinforcements. In the Jiaoxian area, after the Communist troops were repelled, they launched reinforcements again from the north and south on the evening of the 4th, attacking Laopeng, Ducun, and Mazhan, and the fighting was more intense than before.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 6th Dispatch] The National Army, firmly defending Gaomi, resisted the Communist forces, who attacked with several times their strength, fighting a bloody battle for three days and nights. After achieving their expected mission, they have moved to favorable areas and gained the initiative. The battle situation is expected to be decided within a week. A portion of the Communist forces in the Gaomi area fled north towards Jiaoxian on the 5th.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th Dispatch] The battle situation on the outskirts of Jinan was still very quiet on the 6th.

The fighting was fierce. By dawn on the 6th, they were repelled by our defending troops.

[Our Newspaper Baoding, 6th Dispatch] The National Army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway launched a full-scale sweeping operation against the main force of the Communist army. Nie Rongzhen has led the Hebei-Central Plains Field Army east to Hejian. Other Communist units fled to the Taihang Mountains. The remaining Communist local troops, militia, etc., are currently being pursued and swept away by strong National Army forces. The military announced on the afternoon of the 6th that at 12:00 PM on the evening of the 4th, more than 3,000 Communist troops took advantage of the National Army's rotation of troops in Mancheng and suddenly entered the county seat, setting fires and destroying buildings in the city. On the morning of the 5th, the National Army arrived and repelled them. In addition, more than 10,000 Communist troops infiltrated Dawangdian, Maliangying, and Dongxiaoli Town, at the junction of Xushui and Mancheng, attempting to attack the National Army's rear supply line.

### Order in Nong'an Gradually Returns, Communist Troops in the Surrounding Areas Have Been Cleared, Partial Traffic Resumes on Changtao and Jichang Lines

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th Dispatch] According to a telegram from Dehui, General Chen Mingren, Commander of the Fifth Pacification District, arrived in Dehui at noon on the 6th from his forward command post. General Chen led the left-wing corps of his troops and has repeatedly severely damaged the main force of the Communist 3rd, 4th, and 5th Divisions in the past week, pursuing them relentlessly. The largest engagement between his National Army troops and the Communist forces took place in the area between Nong'an, Buhai, Erdaogou, Kezigou, Sitonggou, and Panjialing. The Communist forces suffered more than 2,000 casualties on the spot, and the political commissar of the 11th Regiment of their 4th Division was killed. The remnants fled northwest.

### Different Factions Among the Northeast Communist Army, Lin Biao Will Be Forced to Step Down, Nie Heting Has Been Assassinated Due to Internal Strife

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th Dispatch] The composition of the Northeast Communist Army is complex, with various factions. Although they are all under the command of Lin Biao, the units of the Jilin-Heilongjiang, Jilin-Liaoning, Rehe-Liaoning, and Liaodong Military Regions each have their own independent history and background, and their compliance with Lin Biao's command is often hesitant. In terms of horizontal relationships, it is even more difficult for the various military regions to have a harmonious connection. Since the Siping Street Campaign last year, every offensive of the Northeast Communist Army has resulted in failure. The reason for this is precisely that. This time, Lin Biao launched 250,000 men to invade Changchun. The strength of the force cannot be said to be weak, but after the troops of the Rehe-Liaoning Field Army reached Wanbaoshan, they still failed to capture Dehui from the front. The Communist troops from various routes were unwilling to attack fortified positions. When the National Army deployed a counterattack, the Communist troops were unwilling to defend their already captured strongholds, watching each other, resulting in them being defeated by the National Army one by one. Currently, there is discrimination among the senior generals of the Communist army, and there are rumors that Lin Biao will be forced to step down.

[Another Dispatch] Nie Heting, Commander of the Songjiang Military Region of the Northeast Communist Army, has been assassinated by the Communist army. It is believed that Nie Heting was transferred back to Bei'an in January. The Chinese Communist military and political leaders had long been suspicious of Nie's ideology, and after he arrived in Bei'an, they sent someone to assassinate him. Currently, most of the important officials on the Chinese Communist side are panicking. Another report: After Nie's death, the Communist army secretly did not announce it, but instead claimed that Nie had embezzled 700 million yuan and fled.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Supervisory Yuan has added Commissioner He Hanwen to go to Taiwan to assist Inspector Yang in his work. He is waiting for a flight to depart (possibly by boat), and will likely leave on the bingri [third day of the week], staying in Taiwan for about two weeks.

### Control of Cotton Yarn in Peiping

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 6th Dispatch] The Beiping Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in accordance with the central government's emergency economic measures, convened more than 20 directors and supervisors of the silk, textile, and grain industry guilds at 3:00 PM this afternoon to hold a discussion. It was decided to implement the following preliminary measures for controlling cotton yarn: (1) The current situation of the yarn, cloth, silk, and dyeing industries must be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau within the next week. (2) The inventory of the shops under each industry must be reported on a ten-day basis. (3) The production and sales of the textile factories under the textile and dyeing industries must be reported on a ten-day basis. (4) To prevent the outflow of cotton yarn, it is strictly forbidden to transport whole bolts of cotton cloth out of the city. The Social Affairs Bureau will send a letter to the Police Bureau requesting them to pay attention to the ban at each city gate. (5) The source of cotton will be supplied in large quantities by the Municipal Government to the Tianjin Zhongfang Company. (6) The Beiping Municipal Government will telegraph the central government to instruct Zhongfang not to increase prices at will to avoid hindering the market. (7) The transaction prices of cotton yarn and silk will be reported daily by the respective guilds. (8) Merchants who are not legitimate merchants and have cotton yarn in stock will be reported and dealt with by merchants in each industry at any time.

### Measures for Buying and Selling Gold Ornaments, Principles for Revision Determined, Finished Gold Ornaments Can Be Redeemed and Sold

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] It is learned that the revised principles for the buying and selling of gold ornaments drafted by the Ministry of Finance are approximately as follows: (1) Finished gold ornaments can be redeemed and sold. (2) Purchases and sales must be made according to the prices posted by the Central Bank. (3) If there are purchases and sales, they must be reported and registered immediately. These measures have been revised without violating the economic emergency measures plan, but the final decision has not yet been made and is expected to be announced soon.

### The Third Plenary Session Is About to Open, Each Group Prepares Proposals

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is scheduled to open on the 15th. The venue is located in the National Assembly Hall and is already being arranged. The meeting is scheduled for ten days and is expected to close on the 25th. The Proposals Committee is divided into party affairs, economy, politics, and constitutional affairs groups. After days of discussion, it has drafted a concrete plan, similar in content to the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction of 1937. The economy, politics, and constitutional affairs groups are being drafted by Chen Lifu, Luo Jialun, Sun Ke, and Zhang Lisheng, etc. The party affairs and political affairs groups have completed their discussions. The purpose of politics is to clarify official corruption and implement democratic politics. The principle of party affairs is to end political tutelage and allow other parties to openly operate on an equal and legal basis. The economy and constitutional affairs groups are still under discussion.

### Wu Tiecheng Receives Reporters in Shanghai, Talking About Ways to Resolve the Current Situation, Reorganizing the Government, First the Central Government, Then the Local Governments

[Report from Our Newspaper] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng stated at a press conference yesterday: There are only two ways to resolve the current situation: one is to seek peace through political means, and the other is to seek peace through military means. Because the Chinese Communist Party resolutely refuses to negotiate peace and puts forward unacceptable conditions, closing the door to peace talks, the government can only seek peace through military means today. The Chinese Communist Party has consistently propagated that the Kuomintang does not want peace, but today, the people can easily see who is the destroyer of peace. War is dangerous and tragic, and it is deeply heartbreaking to talk about! As for when the civil war will end, I am not a military expert and dare not speculate. I remember Zhou Enlai saying: By June of this year, both sides can be evenly matched, and then there can be reasonable peace. Such is the view of the Chinese Communist Party, and the people suffer deeply!

Regarding the reorganization of the government, the government hopes that the two parties can join the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan as soon as possible, but because opinions are not yet consistent, discussions are still ongoing in Shanghai. The government hopes that the reorganization can be completed as soon as possible by March 15, and the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will be reorganized at the same time. The number of seats occupied by the two parties is generally correct as reported in the newspapers. The procedure for reorganization is first the central government and then the local governments. Because the Youth Party has more members in local governments, it is natural for them to request participation in local governments. As far as the Kuomintang is concerned, it cannot be said that a transitional government has been formed if the opposition parties only participate in the four institutions of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans and do not participate in the National Government and the Executive Yuan, jointly shoulder responsibilities, end political tutelage, and complete party politics.

### Leaving Space for the Democratic League When the Government Is Reorganized

The government's request for the withdrawal of personnel from the Chinese Communist Party's offices is because it is convenient to obtain transportation by American planes before March 5. As for the points pointed out in the documents of the Garrison Headquarters, they are "local reasons." In the future, the government's attitude towards the Democratic League will be determined entirely by the Democratic League's attitude towards the government, which bears the responsibility of the country. When the government is reorganized, space is left for the Democratic League, welcoming them to participate. This is truly the ultimate in benevolence and righteousness. As for the rumors that there are unfavorable actions against certain pseudo-personnel, I can responsibly answer that they are completely unfounded rumors. Furthermore, because Beiping is close to the front line and Communist troops are emerging in the suburbs, there has been a major search. The situation in Shanghai is different, and this is not necessary.

The economic emergency measures plan has been announced, but it must be implemented effectively. If anything is found to be unworkable in practice, it must be modified. If problems are discovered, they must be corrected immediately. It is hoped that this plan will be supported by the people when it is implemented.

Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng said: This time in Shanghai, one is to urge the standing committee members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties to go to Nanjing to discuss the reorganization of the government, and the other is to welcome his family members who are returning from the United States. As for the celebration of his birthday, at a time when the war has not ceased and the people are suffering, I dare not raise a glass. I expect to return to Nanjing within a few days.

### Progress in the Government Reorganization, Personnel and Positions Will Be Decided Soon

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] Hong Lanyou recently told reporters that if the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties can quickly submit their lists of candidates, the reorganization can definitely be completed before the 15th. It is also learned that progress has been made to the issue of the distribution of seats in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan, and the allocation of ministries. After the members of the Democratic Socialist Party arrive in Shanghai, they will gather to discuss and decide. The Youth Party held a banquet in response to Hong Lanyou's invitation on the evening of the 6th, and some discussions were held. Furthermore, the government and the Youth Party do not seem to deny the Youth Party's decision to participate in the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education. The Democratic Socialist Party may take charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. As for the position of President of the Executive Yuan, there is currently no firm decision-making discussion. People from the Democratic Socialist Party said that the Chairman should not concurrently serve as the President of the Executive Yuan for a long time. As for Zhang Junmai's participation in the Executive Yuan, both the government and the Democratic Socialist Party said that the possibility is extremely small, because Zhang himself firmly stated that he would not participate.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Minister Chen Lifu took the 11:00 PM train back to Nanjing yesterday. Before his departure, he told reporters: This time, he came to Shanghai to listen to the opinions of the industrial and commercial circles, focusing on the production aspect. He will have to read and organize it after returning to Nanjing before he can make a statement.

### The Democratic Socialist Party Opens a Meeting of the Central Standing Committee

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party held a meeting of the Central Standing Committee at the Fanwei yesterday afternoon. The standing committee members who went to Nanjing reported on the negotiation process and exchanged opinions extensively. Because they were waiting for standing committee members Wu Xianzi and Li Daming to come to Shanghai, no specific decisions were made. According to Jiang Yuntian, who told reporters, the government has agreed to a responsible cabinet system and, in principle, does not oppose the point that the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan. Regarding the opening up of local political power, the views of the Democratic Socialist Party are not entirely consistent with those of the Youth Party. What the Democratic Socialist Party focuses on are the constitutional institutions in the local government, such as the institutions that handle elections, etc. The focus of the Democratic Socialist Party's demands is that the number of participants can have an effect and that there can be political achievements after participation. As for the issue of seats in the National Government and the Executive Yuan, the current reports are those proposed by the government in the past, and whether the Democratic Socialist Party agrees depends on the number of participants.

The Command has officially announced the personnel of the Pacification Headquarters, with Commander Sun Lianzhong serving as the Director of the Pacification Headquarters. There are three Deputy Directors, Chen Jicheng, Shangguan Yunxiang, and Ma Fawu.

### Minister Chen of the Municipal Party Department Discusses Relations Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party at a Welcome Reception

[Central News Agency, this city] After Minister Li-fu Chen of the Central Organization Department arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department held a welcome reception yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. at the Municipal Gymnasium on Avenue Albert. Attending were Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, Commander Xuan, Director Kai-xian Wu, Director Yu-xiu Gu, all members of the Municipal Party Department, members of various district party departments and directly subordinate district branches, and party member representatives, totaling more than 3,000 people. Minister Chen, accompanied by Chairman Fang and Commander Xuan, arrived at the venue to a standing ovation. Chairman Fang delivered a speech of introduction, followed by a speech by Minister Chen, which roughly stated: "Today, I am very happy to meet with cadres at all levels of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and some party members. Due to the limited time, I do not have the opportunity to talk to all of you individually. I would like to take this opportunity to present a few points for discussion.

From Accommodation to Purification

Our late Premier led comrades to engage in revolution, overthrow the Manchu Qing dynasty, and establish the Republic of China. He believed that to build the nation, the first step was to achieve unification. If this point were neglected, the nation would be plunged into irretrievable disaster. At that time, there were two forces: the Kuomintang of China and the Communist Party of China. If revolutionary forces were not concentrated, it would be extremely dangerous, and the country would inevitably be fragmented. Therefore, in 1923, a joint declaration was issued with the representative of Lenin, General Joffe, stating that China's revolutionary cause needed unification and that China needed the Three Principles of the People, while communism was not suitable for China's environment. The purpose of this declaration was to bring all forces back into the camp of the National Revolution. As a result, the Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, and all members of the Communist Party were accommodated into our party. We must note that at that time, members of the Communist Party joined individually, not as a group. In order to unify the country, our party compromised and cooperated with the Communist Party, allowing them to join individually. Unexpectedly, after joining, they violated their promises and specialized in making trouble, hindering the progress of the revolution. Therefore, we could no longer tolerate it and had to allow them to leave, leading to the purge of 1927. The occurrence of this event was not a happy occasion for our party, but a very painful one. From 1927 to 1936, for ten years, there was struggle between the two sides, and both sides sacrificed greatly. Therefore, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, we negotiated with the Communist Party again to concentrate our strength and unite against foreign aggression. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the central government, based on the conditions we proposed, issued a declaration on September 21, 1937, committing to a joint national crisis, recognizing that the CCP military would obey the command of Chairman Chiang, that the Three Principles of the People would be the central belief for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, abolishing the established Soviet regime, and ceasing uprisings. Although the CCP did not exert its full strength for the country during the War of Resistance, the goal of preventing them from hindering the War of Resistance was achieved. We only needed the CCP not to be used by the Japanese, in order to show that our country was unified and able to unite against foreign aggression. After the end of the War of Resistance, we needed to intensify the work of nation-building and needed unification even more, so that the country, after eight years of life-and-death struggle, could enjoy long-term stability and move onto the path of democracy. We wanted to realize the nationalization of the military and the democratization of politics, and we did not hesitate to adopt various methods, such as political consultation and peace talks. All of this was done with forbearance, hoping to establish a unified country. The country must be unified in order to have a bright future. The reason why we endured what others could not endure and tolerated what others could not tolerate was not for the party, but entirely for the country, so that the work of national construction could be completed. However, more than a year of effort completely failed. Whether it was the ceasefire order, the military reorganization plan, or the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, all were undermined by the CCP. Finally, the CCP brazenly closed the door to peace, and by last month, peace had become hopeless, and we had to enter a new stage, which was to ask them to return to Yan'an. In short, our past accommodation of the Communists, the purge, and the previous peace talks, all sacrifices, all tolerance, were for the country.

Entering a New Stage

However, today, the facts tell us that all of our party's hopes for the CCP have failed. Our party has not failed the CCP, but the CCP has indeed failed our party (applause). Now, we are starting to step into a new stage. This stage is very difficult. Although the CCP members have left on the surface, in Shanghai, only 34 people have left. Do you believe that there are only 34 CCP members in Shanghai? From this, you can see that your future responsibilities are very heavy. On the one hand, you must work hard in your own work, and on the other hand, you must be able to touch the hearts of the Communists and make them consciously awaken, so that they also have the concept of a nation and a state. That is the greatest success of our comrades. But this is not difficult, because the fundamental weakness of the CCP is that it treats people as tools, making ordinary young people not even know what a country is. We know that some young people are dissatisfied with the status quo, but young people will never fail to love their country and their nation. The fundamental flaw of the CCP is that it has no concept of nation or state. When Mao Zedong went to Chongqing the year before last, he came to see me and asked me why I opposed the Communist Party. I told him at the time that the realization of the Three Principles of the People could transform the semi-colonial Republic of China into an independent, free, and democratic nation. If communism succeeds, at most, the semi-colonial Republic of China will be transformed into a colonial Republic of China (applause). You comrades can convey these few words to every young person. After the War of Resistance, the patriotic thinking of young people became even more fervent. As long as we actively approach them and actively persuade them, even those who have been anesthetized by the Communist Party will surely return to the banner of the Three Principles of the People in a very short time. In short, the only prerequisite today is whether our strength is united and whether our organization is truly strict. The President has instructed us that the current era is an era of scientific mass movement. What is science? The Founding Father said, "Science is the study of different categories." The responsibility of each of our comrades is clear, every moment of time is properly allocated, every space is appropriately utilized, and every matter is handled legally, which is in accordance with science. Now is the beginning of a period of struggle. Whether or not we can succeed depends on whether the methods used are scientific methods and whether our actions are detached from the mass base. Sun Tzu's Art of War tells us that winning without fighting is the best strategy. We must intensify our propaganda work to awaken the remaining Communist elements and return them to the camp of the Three Principles of the People. I hope that you comrades will complete our mission with the greatest confidence and enthusiasm.

Actively Prepare for Constitutional Rule

The Constitution has already been promulgated on New Year's Day this year, and constitutional rule will begin on December 25th. During this transitional period from political tutelage to constitutional rule, we must reform various methods in detail. The Third Plenary Session will discuss this in the future. In short, our words and actions must be especially careful. Each of our comrades should raise our vigilance, increase the enthusiasm of our work, and study how to improve the technology of our work. We must regard the district branch as a school and as a research institution to correct our shortcomings. We have now moved from the defensive response stage to the progressive striving stage. I hope that you comrades will, based on the glorious history of struggle in the past, adapt to the needs of the times and complete the arduous mission with the greatest determination and effort. After the speech, Chairman Fang encouraged all comrades to abide by Minister Chen's instructions, work diligently, and introduced Commander Xuan to speak. Xuan pointed out that during the period of national construction, it is urgent to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and what the citizens of Shanghai need most at present is "stability first." He hoped that the party and government would work together to stabilize Greater Shanghai. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 noon.

### Order in Taiwan Returns to Normal; Government Determined to Improve Politics; Chen Yi Sincerely Explains to Taiwanese Compatriots in Broadcast

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 6th] The disturbances in Taiwan, triggered by the crackdown on cigarette smuggling in Taipei, have been handled through the cooperation of the Governor-General's Office and representatives from all sectors, and social order is gradually returning to normal. Regarding the aftermath of punishing the perpetrators and providing compensation, matters are being handled separately. At 11:00 a.m. today, Governor-General Chen Yi met with representatives of the people, including Jiang Weichuan, and conducted further review of future governance. Chen announced on the spot the government's major decision to improve politics. The meeting ended at 12:40 p.m. (see Chen Yi's broadcast speech for details). The representatives present were satisfied and expressed that they would encourage all compatriots in the province to abide by and implement the decision.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 6th] Governor-General Chen Yi broadcast to compatriots at 8:30 p.m. tonight. The full text is as follows: Taiwanese compatriots, since the "February 28th" incident occurred in Taipei, I have broadcast twice, announcing extremely peaceful solutions. Thanks to the efforts of the authorities and local people in Taipei over the past few days, order has been restored. The various counties and cities that had problems are also improving, and I expect they will return to their original state soon. However, there is still one issue that everyone is concerned about, which is how to improve politics. To improve politics, we must first adjust personnel. I have also considered this point, and I would like to openly and honestly discuss my thoughts with you: First, regarding provincial-level administrative organs, I have considered changing the Governor-General's Office to a Provincial Government and have requested instructions from the central government. Once approved, it can be implemented. During the reorganization, the members of the Provincial Government, the nine department heads, or the heads of various departments, should be appointed as much as possible from local people in the province. It is hoped that the Provincial Assembly and other legitimate organizations that can represent public opinion will recommend suitable local candidates with high character, correct thinking, and outstanding abilities to the central government.

Second, regarding county and city-level administrative organs, I have planned and prepared to hold direct elections to elect county and city mayors starting on July 1st, under the condition that the procedures can be completed. As for the current county and city mayors who have not been democratically elected, I can dismiss those whom the local people believe are incompetent and appoint others based on consultations among the local county and city councils and various legitimate organizations. If you want to participate, you can also be decided by local people through consultation. In short, I hope to represent the majority of public opinion and jointly recommend three candidates, from whom I will appoint one person to serve as county magistrate or mayor and be responsible for preparing for the democratic election of county magistrates and mayors. The current county magistrates and mayors who are deemed competent by the people will continue to perform their duties. As for how to reform various administrations, the provincial government will decide after the reorganization, and the county and city governments will be responsible after the county magistrates and mayors are adjusted.

I have decided to resolve the political problem in this way, but the most important thing at present is to quickly restore order, otherwise the traitors can take the opportunity to make trouble and easily ruin the place. This afternoon, there were still lawless people riding in trucks and snatching weapons from soldiers on the road. The grain problem is also becoming increasingly serious. Now that order has not been established, it is said that the black market price of rice has soared to more than 60 yuan, and the lives of ordinary people have been greatly affected and are extremely painful. I have also heard that students at National Taiwan University have been eating porridge for several days, and I am very concerned. You must know that the current food shortage is entirely caused by the lack of order. To solve the food shortage, we must quickly restore order.

I have heard that some compatriots have moved away because the traitors are spreading rumors to confuse the public. I hope that you will trust the government and not easily believe rumors. The greatest virtue of the Chinese nation is tolerance, not repaying evil with evil. Can we not show the beauty of tolerance towards our own compatriots in this province? This afternoon, I have already spoken to the civil servants and teachers in this city, asking them to show the virtue of tolerance of our Chinese nation, forget this tragic incident, and love and unite with our compatriots in this province.

Compatriots: I have already told you the principles for solving the political problem. As long as the method is decided, it can be implemented. From now on, everyone should quickly calm down, assist the government, restore order, solve the food problem, and prepare for the reorganization of the provincial government and the democratic election of county and city mayors. I mean what I say and take full responsibility for my words. After this painful experience, I hope that the government and the people will jointly strive for a stable, prosperous, pleasant, and peaceful life.

### Shanghai Gold Rush Investigation Report Continued from Yesterday

Analysis of the Causes of Gold Price Fluctuations

Second, analysis of the reasons for gold price changes: Our government borrowed money from the United States, part of which was used to purchase and transport five million taels of gold. The gold policy began to be implemented with the original intention of tightening currency and stabilizing prices. However, due to improper measures by policy implementers and negligence by those executing the business, corruption arose, and the result of the gold policy was the opposite of what was intended. This is one reason for gold price fluctuations.

Those who hold a large amount of legal tender do not engage in production but aim solely to profit. Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and floating capital from all over the country rushes to gather here. The actions of this so-called floating capital and the manipulation by big players are natural phenomena. Now, with inflation, large amounts of legal tender are concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy individuals, who speculate in gold. This is the second reason.

Since the central government announced subsidy measures, imports have decreased, leading to hoarding of foreign goods and an increase in black market items. Transactions are often conducted in gold because of the desire to hoard foreign goods, which inevitably leads to a scramble for gold. This is the third reason.

Shanghai is full of banks and money houses, none of which engage in productive enterprises but engage in commercial speculation and usury. Purchasing gold is unavoidable. This is the fourth reason.

Shanghai workers' wages are too high. At the end of last year according to the lunar calendar, the bonuses and rewards distributed by various factories exceeded 500 billion. Those who held this large amount of legal tender mostly scrambled to buy gold. During the days leading up to the Lunar New Year, gold shops were crowded with buyers. This is the fifth reason.

At the end of last year, the government decided to issue production loans to factories in Shanghai. A total of 314 factories were approved for loans totaling over 65.5 billion yuan. This huge amount of legal tender suddenly increased in the market was not used for production but was used for speculation, harming the market. This is the sixth reason.

Recently, many military and government institutions have been using emergency payment orders or other excuses and means to withdraw cash in Shanghai, misappropriating public funds to engage in commercial speculation, including buying and selling gold. This is the seventh reason.

Shanghai's banks and money houses frequently violate regulations for collateral loans, using 100 million yuan in gold and US dollars and 20,000 gold bars to manipulate legal tender for speculation, disrupting the market. At the end of the year, various banks and money houses settle accounts and receive substantial income, some of which is also used to purchase gold. This is the eighth reason. After the announcement of restrictions on foreign exchange supply, applicants for foreign exchange often only received approval for half or part of their request, forcing merchants to search the market for gold and US dollars on their own. This is the ninth reason.

The Communist Party spreads rumors and incites people to transport agricultural products such as grain, pigs, and cattle from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai specifically to buy gold. This kind of attempt is even more prevalent in Shanghai, and Shanghai newspapers occasionally publish black market gold prices, fueling the gold rush. This is the tenth reason.

In the days before February 8th, the Central Bank suddenly suspended secret transactions, and from the 9th, it suddenly stopped open allocation, causing prices to gradually increase from the 4th to the 8th, and skyrocketing after the 9th. People generally believed that the Central Bank's gold reserves were depleted, leading to even more frantic buying. Moreover, counterfeit gold bars were discovered in the market at this time, further eroding confidence. This is the eleventh reason. In short, the expansion of legal tender, the wavering of credit, and the instability of the situation all create psychological panic among the people, who are unwilling to hold legal tender. Coupled with the Lunar New Year, the Central Bank suddenly issued large denomination bills of 5,000 and 10,000 yuan, concealing the policy in advance and not informing the people of its issuance policy, thus people rush to abandon legal tender and store it in goods and gold. This is inevitable and is the intrinsic factor in gold price fluctuations. (Continued on page 3)

### Hong Kong Legislative Council to Be Amended Official Councilors Reduced by Two, Chinese Councilors Stipulated at Three Yang Muqi Advocates for Half of Municipal Councilors to Be Chinese

[Central News Agency Hong Kong 5th dispatch] A Hong Kong government spokesperson announced tonight that, according to a statement made by the British Colonial Secretary in the Lower House, Hong Kong will amend the Municipal Legislative Council. The original nine official councilor seats will be reduced to seven. According to the statement, the British government has accepted the decision made after consultation between Hong Kong Governor Yang Muqi and representatives of various local organizations, that the Hong Kong government should be formed on the basis of the broadest possible representation.

Editorial

### Sending CCP Personnel Back to Yan'an

The CCP personnel residing in various places in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing flew back to Yan'an today on American aircraft. This must be said to be a major event in domestic politics this year. We, who are full of hope for peace, once rejoiced at the prospect of peace, unity, and democracy. Today, as CCP personnel withdraw to Yan'an, in addition to offering our friendly wishes for a safe journey, we cannot help but sigh at their return!

Everyone knows that the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is subtle and complex. The more one tries to untangle the tangled threads, the more tangled they become, and the farther away peace becomes. The reason for today's temporary severance of relations is, of course, a matter of different opinions. However, the fact that the Communist Party refused peace talks and, more recently, denied the legal status of the National Government is undoubtedly the reason why the door to peace is completely closed. From our objective point of view, there was hope for success in the matter of peace negotiations. The reason for the breakdown was that the Political Consultative Conference at that time did not effectively resolve the Northeast issue. Although there was a ceasefire resolution on January 10th last year, there was still a dispute over the right to take over the Northeast. The government had the right to take over the Northeast in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Agreement, while the Communist Party, taking advantage of its proximity, preemptively occupied Changchun, Harbin, and the railway lines, which forced the first ceasefire order on January 21st last year to fail. On May 23rd, the National Army recovered Changchun, and the Communist Army inside the pass launched a strategic offensive to coordinate with the Northeast. Then, the Military Mediation Department was busy for a long time, and the military ceasefire negotiations began to make headway. On June 2nd, there was a second ceasefire order. Unexpectedly, the point of contention shifted again to the proportion of the Communist Army inside the pass and the withdrawal of the Communist Army from Rehe, Chahar, and northern Jiangsu. Negotiations after negotiations, procrastination after procrastination, the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou on July 3rd and issued the convocation order for the National Assembly, thinking that the military could come to an end and hoping to resume political negotiations. During this period, thanks to the efforts of American General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, other parties and social figures in the country, on October 16th, Chairman Chiang issued an eight-point statement to resolve the situation, and in November, he issued a third indefinite ceasefire order, hoping to gain the list of representatives from the Communist Party to participate in the National Assembly. As a result, peace talks were shelved again. On November 19th, Zhou Enlai and others withdrew to Yan'an, and the general situation had been determined. When General Marshall and Zhou parted, they suggested that Yan'an consider a comprehensive ceasefire on all lines and reopen negotiations. On December 6th, Zhou replied to Marshall, believing that only by immediately disbanding the National Assembly currently being convened and restoring the military position before the ceasefire order of January 13th could all negotiations be restarted. This statement aimed to disintegrate the National Assembly in spirit, undermine the government's credibility, and destroy the value of the constitution. The problem was obviously becoming more complex.

On January 8th of this year, General Marshall left China and returned to the United States, issuing a statement acknowledging the failure of the ceasefire. At this time, the overall situation had reached an impasse. Most observers believed that there was little hope of reversing it, but the government still tried hard to break the deadlock. On January 15th, the government notified Ambassador Stuart to inform the central government that the government intended to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an with peace talk conditions. As a result, Yan'an formally announced its rejection on the 17th. On the 20th, the government issued four statements, but the CCP still refused to accept them. As the situation evolved to this point, military conflicts on all lines became more intense, and the US government announced the termination of its relationship with the three-person group. Then, the Military Mediation Department announced its end. This is the factual process of the government's pursuit of peace talks and the Communist Party's rejection of peace talks over the past year or so.

Although the door to peace talks has been closed, CCP personnel still remain in various places in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, seemingly as if the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are both watching the overall situation, and the political relationship between each other is still tenuously connected. Politics is inherently pragmatic. As long as there are subjective and objective efforts, the door to peace does not seem to be impossible to reopen. However, on February 2nd, the CCP suddenly issued a bombastic statement in Yan'an, denying the validity of all treaties for foreign negotiations, loans, leases, and trade and navigation concluded by the National Government after January 10th last year, and emphasized that the CCP neither acknowledges nor assumes any obligations now or in the future. The nature of this statement is absurd. The National Government is a legitimate government and has long been internationally recognized. There is no reason why a domestic opposition party opposes it while it is internationally recognized! The means by which an opposition party seizes power, the rational and democratic means, are electoral competition and struggles over policies and propaganda; the irrational means are violent revolutions. There is no way to shatter the government's legal status in this way. Therefore, this statement by the Communist Party has no repercussions at home or abroad, and only adds to the ridicule of enlightened people. However, the side effect of this statement is to stimulate a legitimate government. In addition, the Communist armies in various places have stepped up their attacks on the National Army, appearing as enemy countries. Therefore, on February 28th, the government took measures to request the withdrawal of CCP personnel. This measure seems to be the government's countermeasure against the Communist Party, and the Communist Party's determination to sever relations with the government was already evident in the statement on the 2nd of the 2nd month. This is the misfortune caused by the Communist Party's policies, and also the misfortune of the Kuomintang and Communist Party's prospects for peace and unity. It is really worrying about the evolution of the future.

Regarding the withdrawal of CCP personnel, people generally believe that this is an inevitable trend, so there is no surprise internationally. As for the withdrawal of CCP personnel in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, in fact, the CCP may not be willing to withdraw all the lurking party members. Not to mention other places, let's take Shanghai as an example: according to the list nominated by the CCP, there are 17 people in the Zhou Mansion at 107 Sinan Road and 17 people in the Xinhua Daily at Zhubaoshan Road. Any discerning person should know that the number of CCP personnel in Shanghai is definitely more than these 34 people. This kind of withdrawal method obviously has two opposite effects: because CCP cadres withdrew in a hurry, only 34 people were withdrawn, while other party members were abandoned. If this is the case, then the CCP's sense of responsibility to its party members seems to be insufficient. It has failed to fulfill its obligation to withdraw and protect its party members. This is one. Or the CCP has a planned reservation of latent party members, and after the severance of relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it will still take secret activities and prepare to be hostile to the government in action. If this is the case, then the people's tranquility and the order of society will inevitably be threatened by political secret struggles; water flows downwards, and fire burns upwards. The future situation may be unimaginable. Therefore, it is hoped that the government can investigate and register the CCP party members in Shanghai and other places. Their freedom of thought and belief should be allowed, but their actions should not be allowed to affect peace and order, and their personal safety should be guaranteed. If the government allows it to go unchecked and does not take appropriate measures, then if any turmoil unfortunately occurs, and the people suffer losses, or the CCP party members lose legal protection, the responsibility of the government authorities is difficult to shirk.

In short, today is the time for the country to correct chaos and restore order. Everything must not be chaotic. The permanent peace and unity of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is what we fervently hope for. Today, on this day when the Kuomintang and Communist Party's relations have temporarily broken down, we cannot but reiterate our views. On the government's side, we hope that it will continue to do its best to pursue the realization of peace, making every effort for every ray of hope. On the side of all parties and social figures, we hope that they can still seek favorable opportunities, participate in the government as soon as possible, and try to break the deadlock in peace talks and rebuild peace. To the CCP and the CCP personnel who have withdrawn to Yan'an, we hope that they will face up to the reality of politics, not make decisions based on emotions, be frank and open, lay down their weapons, and still make the last and greatest efforts for the future peace prospects. "The past cannot be recovered, but we hope for the present." Although we are very worried about the current situation of the country, we are gazing at the brilliant rosy clouds in the distance. The country's future is gradually moving towards governance, and there is infinite hope. Let us encourage each other!

### Marshall Arrived in Paris Yesterday Held Political Talks with French Authorities Staying Overnight Scheduled to Continue to Moscow via Berlin Today

[Our Newspaper News] London 6th Broadcast: Marshall arrived at the Paris airport at 12:40 this afternoon (Greenwich Mean Time, Shanghai time 8:40 PM). Marshall will stay briefly in Paris and hold political talks with French President Auriol and Prime Minister Ramadier. Since Foreign Minister Bidault has already gone to Moscow, Marshall will discuss matters with Acting Foreign Minister de Hauteclocque. According to the French side, Foreign Minister de Hauteclocque will ask to what extent Marshall's attitude towards a suggestion made by Vernasse in April last year, regarding the signing of a four-power pact to guarantee German disarmament for 25 years after the end of Allied occupation. Does Marshall still wish to proceed with the signing of the agreement? Marshall is scheduled to fly from Paris to Berlin on Friday and to Moscow before the weekend.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 6th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall arrived here at Orly Airport at 12:40 this afternoon by special plane, en route to Moscow. Several senior State Department officials came with him. US Ambassador to France Caffery and French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet were at the airport to welcome him. Marshall told reporters: "This trip is fast, ahead of schedule. I am sincerely pleased to revisit France and have the opportunity to have contact with French government personnel. Perhaps asked about the Moscow Conference, Secretary Marshall only said that before expressing his opinion, he should quietly observe the development of the situation. After Marshall and his party got off the plane, they drove to the US Embassy to rest. French Prime Minister Ramadier issued a welcoming speech on the day of Secretary Marshall's arrival, saying: "We are greatly honored to have General Marshall as our guest for a few days. General Marshall is one of the greatest creators of our common victory. The French government should do its best to repay him. As far as we French are concerned, General Marshall is not only a representative of an allied country, but also one of the creators of the liberation of France. We should express our gratitude in the most glorious way in the next two days. It is a pity that Secretary Marshall's stay here is too short." French President Auriol is scheduled to meet with Marshall at the Presidential Palace that evening.

[Reuters Paris 6th Dispatch] According to the Chicago Tribune reporter on Secretary Marshall's special plane, at the French President's banquet, Secretary Marshall will discuss with the French government leaders the alliance relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union, and France may suggest, in a skillful way, the establishment of a similar alliance with the United States. Former US Secretary of State Byrnes made such a proposal to the French side last summer, but was rejected by the French side. Now that the diplomatic situation is different from last summer, the French government may be willing to raise this matter.

[Reuters London 5th Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin and others arrived in Berlin this afternoon and will arrive in Warsaw at noon on Thursday. The Polish government has invited Foreign Secretary Bevin to stay in Warsaw for a few hours to see the wartime destruction of the city. When Bevin arrived in Berlin, a reporter asked how long he would stay in Moscow, and Bevin replied, "About a few weeks." Asked what he hoped for, he said, "I hope it will be a success."

[Agence France-Presse Paris 5th Dispatch] The French delegation attending the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, led by Foreign Minister Bidault, set off from here at 3:13 this afternoon by special train to Moscow. General Koenig, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in Germany, will go directly to the Soviet capital from Berlin.

[United Press London 6th Dispatch] The first of four planes flying from Washington to Moscow, carrying a total of 24 US representatives and journalists, was forced to fly back to Amsterdam, Netherlands, after being unable to land at Berlin Airport for 45 minutes due to fog.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Faces Difficulties; Doubt Remains Whether a Peace Treaty with Germany Can Be Completed; Secretary Marshall Issues Statement Before Leaving the Country

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Secretary of State Marshall departed today for Moscow to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Prior to his departure, he publicly expressed doubt as to whether the conference could complete a peace treaty with Germany. Marshall urged people worldwide not to harbor excessive hopes. He hoped a treaty with Austria could be drafted in Moscow, but regarding the larger issue of a German peace treaty, he deemed it "highly doubtful." Therefore, another Foreign Ministers' Conference may be held later this year to attempt to break the deadlock between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the German peace issue. Furthermore, according to Agence France-Presse, Republican foreign policy expert John Foster Dulles accompanied Secretary Marshall to Moscow. He told reporters that millions of people sacrificed themselves during the war, and their ideals continue to exist. We who have survived bear a sacred responsibility to respect their last will and testament and to create peace according to their ideals. We are going to Moscow to strive to achieve this goal, but for success, we still need the moral support of the American people.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Evening newspapers report that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will insist that the peace conference with Germany be held in London. It is expected that the German peace conference will be convened after the four Foreign Ministers' Conference reaches an agreement on the German peace treaty.

### Soviet Union and Poland Establish Loan Agreement; Polish-Czech Treaty to be Signed

[United Press International, New York, 6th] According to a Moscow broadcast on the evening of the 5th, Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz has signed a loan agreement with the Soviet Union for $28,850,000. The broadcast also stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to extend credit loans to Poland for military supplies and equipment. Other terms of the agreement include a 50% reduction in Polish coal shipments to the Soviet Union, the return of Soviet war booty such as railway tracks and locomotives to Poland, and the return of German merchant ships due to Poland on May 15th. Furthermore, according to news from Warsaw reported in New York newspapers, a mutual assistance treaty between Poland and Czechoslovakia to prevent German aggression will be signed in Warsaw on the eve of the four-power conference in Moscow (the 9th). It is speculated here that the reason for expediting this treaty is to complete the network of treaties among Slavic countries, thereby presenting a solid Slavic front when the four-power conference convenes. Although this treaty is termed a friendship treaty, the dispute between Czechoslovakia and Poland over Teschen, the coal-rich region seized by Poland when Hitler invaded Czech Bohemia, remains unresolved. Therefore, the treaty does not specifically address border issues, and its purpose is clearly limited to German aggression, and is not a formal military mutual assistance pact.

### British Troops to Temporarily Remain in Greece; British Reply Delivered to Washington

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Official sources here announced that the British government has informed the United States that it does not intend to withdraw its troops stationed in Greece in the near future and stated that if the United States is willing to share responsibility for Greece, the United Kingdom is prepared to accept American assistance.

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A State Department spokesman said that the British government's reply to the U.S. State Department's note regarding aid to Greece has been received. The spokesman declined to disclose the contents of the reply, only stating that President Truman will issue a statement on the Greek issue.

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The government's request for immediate military and economic aid to Greece has aroused opposition in Congress today. Congress will demand that President Truman issue a detailed and candid statement regarding the facts behind the Greek issue. Speakers in both the House and Senate criticized the State Department for independently deciding to help Britain handle the thorny Greek problem without fully explaining how this affects America's traditional policy of non-intervention.

After Returning from Visit to Mexico, Truman Delivers Speech Advocating Free International Trade

[Agence France-Presse, Mexico City, 6th] President Truman concluded his visit to Mexico and returned to the United States by plane this morning at 5:30 a.m. Yesterday, the President flew over the Paricutin volcano, which emerged only four years ago and is currently active. In the afternoon, the President visited the Indian pyramids and Toltec temples 40 miles north of here.

[Agence France-Presse, Waco, Texas, USA, 6th] President Truman delivered a speech here today at Baylor University after receiving an honorary doctorate, stating that past major lessons have proven that peace, freedom, and world trade are inextricably linked. The United States is determined to achieve international free trade through various means. The United Nations has now resolved political disputes through negotiations, and economic disputes should also be resolved in this way. Our political and economic relations with foreign countries are inseparable. Our country is the giant of the economic world, and regardless of what we think, the future form of economic relations will ultimately follow our lead. Therefore, we can lead countries into economic peace or plunge them into economic war. The American people value freedom more than peace. The American way of life is based on private commerce. Therefore, regarding the control of foreign trade by various governments, if this trend is not changed, the U.S. government will soon use the same methods under this pressure to compete for markets and raw materials, but this is what we want to avoid after the war. I have great hope for the United Nations International Trade Organization plan. The United States should initiate negotiations to reduce tariffs and eliminate restrictions. A conference will be held in Geneva next month to discuss this plan, and I deeply hope that it will not fail. After implementing free trade, imports will inevitably increase, but the United States has no need to worry about this. Know that after the two world wars, isolationism has been declared bankrupt in morality and spirit. Creating peace and freedom is not easy. It depends on mutual understanding, trust, and cooperation between friendly countries in politics and economics to succeed.

### British House of Commons Debates India Issue Heatedly

Cripps Defends Government

[Reuters, London, 5th] The House of Commons began a two-day debate on the Indian issue today. Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade and former member of the Cabinet Mission to India, spoke first on behalf of the government, stating that the British government's decision to withdraw from India before June 1948, allowing Indian leaders to seize this opportunity to abandon prejudices and reach an understanding, has reached its final and critical stage. This decision will affect Britain, India, and the whole world. It is an adventurous move, but the British government believes that this is the only correct path, and in these urgent times, further hesitation is no longer permissible. Cripps said that the first task of the British Cabinet Mission was to show the Indian people Britain's sincerity. The British government believes there are two ways to proceed: one is to strengthen British control over India, increase the number of British troops stationed in India, and wait until there is a complete agreement within India. However, this move would require Britain to remain in India for at least 15 to 20 years, which would inevitably arouse opposition from all sides in India and would be difficult to implement in practice. The other way is to notify India with a certain deadline that Britain will continue to maintain its responsibility for India within the deadline, urging it to reach an agreement. Once the deadline expires, Britain will withdraw, regardless of whether there is an agreement within India. If all factions in India can sincerely cooperate in the Constituent Assembly and the interim government, and formulate a constitution suitable for all ethnic groups and religions based on the principle of respecting mutual rights, then civil war can be avoided and resources can be developed, benefiting India and all other ethnic groups. Sir Annesley Somerville, a Conservative MP, spoke first on behalf of the opposition, criticizing the government for two major mistakes: one was transferring administrative power to representative institutions before obtaining a satisfactory constitutional settlement; the other and greater mistake was setting a deadline for withdrawing all power. This measure will cause Indians to adopt a wait-and-see attitude within the deadline, waiting for the deadline to expire before they can do whatever they want without any restrictions. Anderson then moved that the House of Commons refuse to accept the government's decision to withdraw from India by the deadline. The motion will be voted on tomorrow.

### Section of British Royal Train Derailed in South Africa

[Agence France-Presse, Royal Train in South Africa, 6th] A section of the supply train of the royal train carrying the British King on his tour of South Africa suddenly derailed at 9 o'clock last night. The extent of casualties and losses is unknown.

### U.S. Sends Note to Soviet Union Protesting Soviet Actions in Hungary

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] It is understood that Secretary of State Marshall's last diplomatic act before embarking to Moscow was to send a stern note to the Soviet Union tonight, protesting the alleged Soviet interference in the Hungarian non-Communist government. The State Department has made no statement on this matter so far, but it is understood that the note called the Soviet Union's attention to the fact that the United States considers the current government of the "Smallholder" party in Hungary, produced by "free and unfettered elections," to be a legitimate ruling body. The note is believed to have attacked the Soviet Union's attempts to undermine the "Smallholder" party in favor of the Hungarian Communist Party and firmly stated that the United States considers the Hungarian cabinet to be one of the few Central European governments that truly represents the people.

The State Department's note, like previous notes since March 1, attacked the Soviet Union's refusal to negotiate with the United States and Britain on a "three-way" aid plan for Hungary, which is a deliberate violation of the Yalta Agreement.

The Soviet Union has never responded to the previous two efforts to implement the Yalta pledges, but the United States continues to aid the Hungarian government in order to directly establish a sound political foundation. The United States has already established a credit loan relationship with Hungary, with loans totaling $30 million, allowing the Hungarian government to obtain surplus army supplies. At the same time, the U.S. government is also protesting the Soviet Union's removal of Hungarian machinery and the imposition of excessive reparations on the Hungarian people.

### Korean Delegation to China Appeals for Independence and Freedom; Hodge Clarifies U.S. Policy on Korea

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Korean Provisional Government's delegation to China recently appealed for independence, sending memoranda to the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, stating that Korea has the right to declare independence in the international community and put forward four suggestions: (1) Please allow the Korean people to organize their own provisional government; (2) Immediately withdraw U.S. and Soviet occupation forces; (3) Abolish trusteeship; (4) Form a four-power technical advisory group to promote post-war reconstruction in Korea.

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] General Hodge, commander of U.S. forces in southern Korea, is currently in consultation with the State Department and the War Department here on the Korean issue. Today, he declared that he firmly believes that the most democratic country in the East can be created in Korea. The desire for independence is surging in the hearts of the Korean people, and this is part of their lives. So far, the U.S. military has not obtained cooperation from the Soviet Union to complete the unification of Korea, but it is believed that this cooperation is coming soon. If the Soviet Union knows that the U.S. military has the support of the people at home and that the U.S. military is not here to dominate the world, but to pursue a more perfect world, then the Soviet Union should be able to cooperate with the U.S. military.

The Whole Nation is United to Achieve the Goal

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Korean sources close to Syngman Rhee sent a telegram from Seoul today through the "Korea America News Agency" stating: "Korean political parties are now moving closer to agreement on the independence plan, and the whole country is waiting for news of the formation of a provisional government." The telegram quoted Kim Gu as saying that any Korean will forget his political party for the final struggle for the liberation of the Korean nation. Kim Gu also said that the unanimous public opinion is "Whether we belong to the right wing or the left wing, whether we are communists or nationalists, all people are willing to sacrifice everything as long as we can achieve unification and independence."

### Soviet Representative Attacks U.S. Control of Atomic Energy Plan Again; Reiterates Old Views and Insists on Concluding a Convention

[United Press International, Lake Success, 5th] Soviet representative Gromyko, who strongly opposes international operation or possession of atomic energy facilities in various regions, launched a new offensive against the U.S. plan to control atomic energy in the Security Council today, stating for the first time that the Soviet Union is worried that the U.S. plan is an attempt to interfere in the Soviet Union's internal affairs. Gromyko bluntly criticized the proposal to grant unlimited power to the international control agency to interfere in the economic aspects of various countries' internal affairs that are not related to atomic energy facilities. Gromyko opposed for the first time the U.S. proposal for the international development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, the proposal for atomic power plants. Gromyko also said, "The Baruch plan completely disregards the interests of other countries and attempts to subordinate the interests of various countries to the interests of the United States alone." The Soviet representative reiterated that the Soviet Union strongly supports the necessity of strict international control of atomic energy, as Stalin clearly stated in his response to United Press President Baillie in October last year. Gromyko today reiterated the old tune from February, insisting that the first step in the actual control of atomic energy is to conclude an agreement "prohibiting the use, manufacture, and storage of atomic weapons," and then discuss control matters. Gromyko also said that this is only one of the basic conflicts in the Soviet Union's control plan. At this point, Gromyko attacked the U.S. control and investigation plan and its plan for the international atomic energy development organization to universally investigate the application of atomic energy in English. Finally, Gromyko said that the U.S. plan can only be regarded as an attempt by the United States to monopolize atomic energy.

### Einstein Regrets Inventing the Atomic Bomb

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 6th] The great scientist Professor Einstein recently published an article in the current issue of "Newsweek," discussing the atomic bomb. He said: The secret of the atomic bomb has now become the Americans' "Maginot Line." This line gives us imaginary security, but its danger is actually great. The only way to prevent the atomic bomb in the world is to inform the public of the terror if the atomic bomb is used again and to warn each other. If I had known earlier that the Germans could not invent the atomic bomb, I would not have contributed to the atomic bomb.

### Dutch East Indies Detains American Merchant Ship; U.S. Protests to Netherlands

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The State Department today lodged a protest with the Dutch government against the export restrictions of the Dutch East Indies, which resulted in the detention of the American merchant ship "Pelham." The ship was carrying a batch of goods such as rubber from the territory of the East Indies Republican Government in Java and was detained by the Dutch Navy. The United States protested that the export regulations not only restricted Dutch East Indies trade but also deprived the world of essential supplies, especially food. The U.S. government reserves all rights for losses suffered by the "Pelham" or its crew.

Dutch Reply

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 6th] After the United States protested to the Dutch government for the detention of the ship "Pelham," the Dutch Customs Office issued a statement stating that the detention of the ship was in accordance with recently promulgated regulations, the purpose of which is to protect the interests of foreigners purchasing goods from the East Indies, especially Americans.

### Admiral Halsey Retires Due to Old Age

[United Press International, Washington, 6th] Admiral Halsey, 64, who led the aircraft carrier fleet to inflict a huge blow on the Japanese in the past, has retired due to poor health.

### Reading the Newspaper from Now On Will Be More Flavorful; Advertisements Can Emit Meat Fragrance; American Professor Designs Scented Advertisements

[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Professor Bien, professor of pharmacology at the University of Oklahoma, recently promoted that future newspaper advertisements can emit scents. Mr. Bien is currently working on an unprecedented commercial advertisement for a restaurant, so that the meat in the advertisement picture can emit a fragrance like real meat. This is a university professor who enjoys the reputation of "scent expert." Scented advertisements will be a new type of advertisement after full-color advertisements. Mr. Bien's new attempt is reminiscent of a recent announcement of a new invention in photography that can produce three-dimensional images on paper, as if the things photographed were concrete. This discovery can further accelerate the production of scented advertisements, and one day, hungry newspaper readers will face delicious food in color, scent, and taste that is like the real thing in advertisement pictures.

France Reaffirms Policy on Vietnam; Striving to Restore Order and Prevent Disturbing Attempts; General Observation Suggests Signs of Reconciliation

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] The cabinet met this afternoon, presided over by President Auriol, and listened to a detailed report from Colonial Minister Moutet, and then decided on its policy on Vietnam. A communique was issued afterward stating: "The government hereby reiterates that it will strive to restore order and security in Vietnam, suppress any attempt to disturb, and prevent violations of the rights of ethnic minorities. The government has made promises to Vietnam that it will grant the people of Vietnam the legal status of a free associated state in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the French Union. The government will abide by its promises in the future."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] The French cabinet decided today to award the military medal to Vice Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu. It is expected that he will go to Vietnam with the new High Commissioner Bollaert to handle the handover. Bollaert, who is currently a member of the French National Assembly, must return to the country after six months because he is unwilling to resign from his position as a member of parliament.

[United Press International, Paris, 6th] The future direction of France's handling of the Viet Minh incident has aroused speculation. The following developments are noteworthy: (1) According to government sources, d'Argenlieu's dismissal was because his policy lacked flexibility and was insufficient to restore political stability in Vietnam. (2) The communique mentioned for the first time that the rebellious actions have spread to western Vietnam. (3) The military and peace conditions proposed by the Viet Minh, namely the replacement of the D'Argenlieu team and the recall of Leclerc, have been fulfilled by the French. Although Bollaert has not been ordered to negotiate with the Viet Minh and is unwilling to consider the peace conditions proposed by the Viet Minh, observers believe that this is possible.

### Krug Advocates Statehood for Hawaii

Pacific Islands Should Be Under Civilian Administration

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Interior Secretary Krug, who returned from inspecting various Pacific islands, gave a speech advocating rapid statehood for Hawaii and that the other U.S. islands in the Pacific should be managed by civilian agencies. It is said that MacArthur believes that Hawaiian statehood will help Japan become a screen against "a form of rule that we do not welcome" in the future (referring to communism). MacArthur's past achievements and his current administration in Japan and the Ryukyu Islands have deeply impressed me.

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] Krug is scheduled to attend the House Public Lands Committee on the 7th to urge the committee to grant Hawaii statehood.

### Standardization of Military Equipment; British and French Negotiations in London; Belgian Minister of Defense Invited to Visit Britain

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] Pravda's correspondent in Paris telegraphed that General Tassigny, Inspector General of the French Army, is currently holding negotiations with British authorities to discuss the issue of standardizing military equipment between the two countries. The British Foreign Office recently denied that Nitetesi and other French generals went to the UK to negotiate the standardization of military equipment. In fact, the Foreign Office denied it to avoid over-exaggerating the bilateral negotiations. In addition, France and the Netherlands will also conclude a military equipment standardization agreement in the near future.

[Reuters, London, 5th] Belgian Defense Minister Colonel Terfve, at the invitation of the British Military Committee, is expected to arrive in London today. He will meet with British Defense Minister Alexander, Army General Montgomery, Air Minister Noel-Baker, and Imperial Chief of Staff Montgomery. Sources from the Belgian government revealed that Terfve's trip to London is related to the Anglo-Belgian arms standardization agreement, but this statement has not been officially confirmed here.

### Spanish Government Denies Rumors that Franco Was Assassinated

[Our Report] London Radio on the 6th: The Spanish government has issued a statement formally denying rumors that Franco was assassinated.

### U.S. Expresses Approval of Anglo-French Alliance

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] A State Department spokesman said today that the U.S. government is most concerned with disarming Germany so that it will never again threaten peace. The Anglo-French treaty seems to be in line with this principle, so the U.S. government expresses its deep approval. The Anglo-French treaty does not harm the support of both Britain and France for the Four Powers' Control of Germany Convention, which makes the United States feel particularly satisfied. The U.S. government welcomes Britain and France promoting mutual relations within the United Nations system.

### MacArthur Runs into Obstacles; U.S. Army Secretary Overturns Approved Decision

[Our Report] San Francisco Radio on the 6th: An unprecedented event occurred in the history of the occupation of Japan today. The World Federation of Trade Unions had requested MacArthur to allow it to send a delegation to Japan and Korea, which MacArthur decided to reject, but this decision has now been overturned by Army Secretary Patterson. The U.S. Army has approved the union to send a delegation to Japan and Korea, but will not be responsible for all expenses of the delegation. The World Federation of Trade Unions is a joint organization of workers' organizations from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France after the war. This is the first time that the U.S. Army Department has disagreed with MacArthur's decision.

### Bulganin Concurrently Serves as Deputy Prime Minister

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] Radio stations here broadcast that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has appointed the new Minister of Defense General Bulganin to concurrently serve as Deputy Prime Minister and appointed Army Chief of Staff Marshal Vasilevsky as Deputy Minister of Defense.

### Shanghai Gold Rush Investigation Report - Continued from Page 2

Analysis of Responsibility for Gold Price Fluctuations

Third, Analysis of Responsibility for Gold Price Fluctuations (B): The executor of the gold policy and its operations was Song Ziwen. The four people were Bei Zuyi, Lin Fengbao, and Yang Anren. Song and Bei were responsible for policy decisions, while Lin and Yang were responsible for the implementation of operations. As for the truth about the use and sale of gold, prior to January of this year, the Ministry of Finance, the competent authority of the Central Bank, did not receive any reports. Only Bei and others reported to Song in English in detail every day. The purpose of the gold policy was to tighten the currency, absorb legal tender, and at the same time, legal tender was the legal currency, while gold was a commodity, not a currency. Now, gold has become the object of transaction and profit, and has become the actual currency. Gold has long lost its focus as the gold policy. In the past, legal tender was exchanged for gold, but now legal tender is exchanged for gold. The less gold, the more legal tender. The government can no longer control a large amount of legal tender with a small amount of gold, and legal tender is even rampant, with no hope of recovery. Song Ziwen did not plan ahead and stopped the gold policy, causing gold to break away from monetary relations and return to its original status as a commodity. This led to today's economic crisis, allowing speculators to profit while the country and the people suffered. This is one of the responsibilities that Song Ziwen should bear for gold price fluctuations.

The responsibility for the implementation of the gold policy is so significant, and the executor is the President of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi. How carefully should the president review and plan in detail? However, upon examining its content, there are many loopholes and corrupt practices. The methods of openly distributing and secretly selling gold are not clearly stipulated. The institutions responsible for distribution were arbitrarily designated by Bei, Lin, and Yang as five gold shops and silver shops, based solely on personal relationships, without any standards. Furthermore, the decision on the implementation of operations largely fell on the shoulders of Deputy Director Yang Anren alone. This constitutes extreme negligence in policy implementation. This is the second responsibility that Bei Zuyi should bear for gold price fluctuations.

The purpose of the Central Bank's implementation of the gold policy was to withdraw legal tender and stabilize prices. Therefore, suppressing gold prices should have been the sole mission. However, the actual situation of the Central Bank's implementation not only forgot its goal, but also intentionally followed the black market and even had the suspicion of catching up and leading the black market. As a result, it was exhausted and exhausted, causing gold to usurp the role of the master, becoming the controller of legal tender and price control. This is the third responsibility that Bei Zuyi should bear for gold price fluctuations.

The gold rush has repeatedly demonstrated that its dangers have long been lurking. When the Central Bank decided to openly buy and sell in Shanghai, it should have taken into account the market situation and distributed gold equally across the country, so as not to make the price high in this place and low in that place, gradually opening up the speculative market. Now, gold distribution has made all illegal speculation legalized due to the legalization of gold speculation. Therefore, collusion between business operators and merchants for profit is easy to form under extremely convenient terms. This is the fourth responsibility that Bei Zuyi should bear for gold price fluctuations.

Before February 8th, the Central Bank suspended secret sales for several days, while the market simultaneously discovered Chongqing factory gold bars, leading to a surge in prices. This was because people thought that the Central Bank's gold reserves were exhausted, and they scrambled to buy gold. On the 8th, only one day of distribution was carried out, and on the 10th, the suspension of distribution was suddenly announced. The event happened suddenly, causing the gold price to change several times in one day, even exceeding nine levels. The sudden suspension around the 8th actually stimulated speculators. The facts are clear. This is the fifth responsibility that Bei Zuyi should bear for gold price fluctuations.

The Central Bank had no fixed methods or clear regulations for implementing this business procedure. Everything was freely decided by Bei, Lin, and Yang. The previous application procedures had long been abolished, and open distribution and secret sales were entirely handled by the five gold shops and silver shops designated by the three. There were no contracts or evidence. Everything was decided by the five shops talking on the phone. The gold policy was so important, and the opportunity for gold speculation was so widespread. Yet, it was carried out hastily and carelessly, without any regard. This is the sixth responsibility that Bei, Lin, and Yang should bear for gold price fluctuations.

The selection of the five gold shops and silver shops was entirely based on their relationship with Bei and the other two, without any standards. The capital of the five shops was not the most substantial among their peers. Why was Tong Fengyu alone favored and given such important responsibility? Zhan Liansheng, a shareholder of Tong Fengyu, only held one-fifteenth of the shares of the shop. However, the Central Bank relied heavily on Zhan Liansheng alone. Tong Fengyu was introduced by Zhan, and all the Central Bank's entrusted distribution, melting, and distribution were concentrated in Tong Fengyu. The five shops all went through Zhan for receiving gold and paying, and his signature and seal were required. He was responsible for the overall sales. Therefore, Tong Fengyu also received the most distribution. Although there were five shops in name, only Tong Fengyu actually had the power of control, and only Zhan Liansheng alone. After the Central Bank distributed the gold, it did not ask how it was distributed or what the selling price was. With such a situation of manipulation and control, one does not need to be intelligent to know. This is the seventh responsibility that Bei, Lin, and Yang should bear.

From January 4th to the suspension of sales on February 15th, the Central Bank entrusted the five shops to distribute 79,440 gold bars. Tong Fengyu accounted for the most, exceeding half of the total. Tong Fengyu suddenly purchased a large number of gold bars within half an hour before the government announced the suspension of distribution. The market price soared even higher, indicating that they had prior knowledge and engaged in manipulation. There is an inevitable suspicion of a special tacit understanding between the business executors and Tong Fengyu. This is the eighth responsibility that Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren should bear for the gold rush fluctuations.

Yang Anren was the most involved in deciding the distribution quantity and price by talking to the five shops on the phone. Sometimes, the decision was made only with Tong Fengyu. Furthermore, the market price of the silver shops was determined by the market price of the gold shops, and the market price of the gold shops was determined by the conversation between Zhan Liansheng and Yang Anren. This is the ninth responsibility that Yang Anren should bear for gold price fluctuations.

The number of gold bars distributed by the Central Bank from January 4th to February 15th, as listed by the Central Bank, differed daily from the number of bars distributed as listed by the five shops. The totals also differed. Yang Anren was in charge of managing gold and recording trading prices. This is the tenth responsibility that Yang Anren should bear for gold price fluctuations.

Among the customer accounts of the five shops, there were multiple accounts belonging to Central Bank employees. For example, Wang Songtao, who managed the gold vault accounts and knew the secret of the gold reserves, also had accounts for purchasing gold bars. This is the eleventh responsibility that Yang Anren and Wang Songtao should bear for gold price fluctuations.

The above are the details that the committee members have learned during this investigation into the gold rush case. In addition to separately requesting impeachment for the illegal and derelict parts of the relevant personnel, this report is submitted respectfully for review. (End of full text)

### The Second Session of the City Council Resumes Today - Two Urgent Proposals - Request the Central Government to Unfreeze the Cost of Living Index - Propose that Japanese War Reparation Generators be Allocated to the City - Discussion of the Municipal Construction Donation Issue in the Afternoon

[Report from our newspaper] The Municipal Council held its second session at the beginning of January this year and discussed many municipal facility projects. However, the first draft of the municipal government's budget for the 36th year of the Republic of China was very important and the issue was complex. For the sake of prudent review, the meeting was specially extended to February. During the extension period, the various committees went to the various bureaus and departments of the municipal government for inspection, and the Budget Committee conducted preliminary reviews several times. Now that the extension period has expired, the Municipal Council has decided to continue its second session today. The session is tentatively scheduled for two days to discuss the municipal budget for this year and other important matters.

The conference will be held on the fourth floor of the council's new address at Tangzhan Road (formerly the Japanese Overseas Residents Association). The ninth meeting, held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM today, will discuss the unfinished cases from the previous session and three proposals submitted by the speaker, namely: (1) The proposal to submit to the general assembly for a public vote on the Nanjing Municipal Council's temporary general assembly passing a declaration on the current situation, suggesting that the councils of various provinces and cities each appoint representatives to hold a temporary joint meeting. (2) The proposal to submit to the general assembly for a public vote on the request of Sun Xiangzhong, chairman of the Shanghai Private Schools Relief Association, to include the compensation for the losses of private schools in the first batch of materials for Japanese reparations, which will soon be shipped to China, as a priority for compensation. (3) The proposal suggested by the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee to convert the former Japanese shrine at 101 Jiangwan Road into a martyrs' shrine to comfort the loyal and righteous. This afternoon, the issue of collecting municipal construction donations will be discussed.

Furthermore, the council believes that the session is very short this time, and the main topic is to discuss the municipal budget. Therefore, except for urgent matters that need to be resolved, it will not accept proposals from councilors for the time being. It is reported that the council has received important proposals, and two proposals have been approved by the speaker and submitted to the general assembly for discussion: (1) A proposal by Shui Xiangyun and others to request the central government to unfreeze the cost of living index from April 1st to avoid affecting the lives of workers. (2) A proposal by Xi Wangshu and others: the city's electricity is short by 60,000 kilowatts per month, which greatly hinders production. Therefore, it is proposed that the central government allocate the two generators from Japan's reparations to China to Shanghai for application, and it is also suggested to form a joint electric company to manage these two generators. The city's power company has ordered such a large number of generators from the United States. It will take four or five years to ship them to Shanghai for assembly and power generation, while it will only take more than a year to transport and install them from Japan.

Some of the unclaimed accumulated coffins will be gradually cremated. Furthermore, a citizen suggested that co-bathing in large bathhouse pools is unsanitary and requested that it be banned and converted into shower rooms. It was resolved that a decision will be made after the Health Bureau studies it.

Furthermore, the Council's Land Administration Committee held its eighth meeting yesterday and discussed several proposals, including: (1) Representatives of all residents of Jiashen Village, Longhua, Wang Longji and others, submitted a petition stating that the municipal government was ordered to forcibly relocate the houses in the village. They pleaded that the relocation be waived and that the municipal government be requested to clear the land requisition procedures as soon as possible. It was resolved to send a letter to the municipal government to forward the request to maintain the status quo before the land requisitioned for the Longhua Airport during the enemy puppet period is resolved. (2) For the Shanghai-Jiangsu border demarcation meeting, it was decided to recommend councilors Yang Shukan and Wang Weiqu to attend. (3) Chen Tingrui, on behalf of the tenants of 1-7 Beidang Apartments, etc., received a notice from the enemy and puppet property clearing office of the China Trust Bureau to recover and forcibly relocate them.

### Zhan Liansheng, Who Contracted for Gold Distribution, is Suspected of Serious Involvement - His Actions are Under Surveillance - The Results of the Investigation by the Economic Supervision Team are the Same as the Report of the Supervisory Committee

[Report from our newspaper] Zhan Liansheng, the manager of Wen Fengyu Gold Shop in the city, contracted for the Central Bank to distribute gold and had significant control during the gold rush. He is also suspected of manipulating the market based on insider information. This has been pointed out by the Supervisory Committee in its report on the gold rush investigation. It is now learned that the Economic Supervision Team's investigation into the gold rush also believes that Tong Fengyu is seriously suspected. In the blacklist submitted by the Economic Supervision Team to Chairman Jiang for review, Zhan Liansheng is one of the "big tigers." He is now awaiting the Chairman's approval before he can be dealt with according to law. At the same time, the police are closely monitoring Zhan Liansheng's actions.

The general report on the gold rush investigation by the Economic Observation Team is said to be published soon. According to responsible sources, the content of the report is more practical and extensive than the one submitted by the Supervisory Committee. It has made a detailed statistical analysis of the speculators and manipulators in the gold rush, which can be divided into seven categories: (1) Tong Fengyu, Tai Kangrun, and Dafengheng Gold Shops, and Fang Jiuxia Changji and Yang Qinghe Faji Silver Shops, which were entrusted by the Central Bank to openly sell and secretly dump gold bars, are suspected of profiting from them. (2) Most of the 65 gold shops in Shanghai, most of which are unregistered, have been making profits by taking advantage of time and manipulating the market. (3) Banks and money shops that do not have permission from the Ministry of Finance but only have operating licenses issued by the Central Bank are engaged in gold trading, which is also one of the reasons for the surging speculative tide. (4) Securities firms also operate gold trading for profit. (5) Gold touts make commissions by snatching and selling. (6) Silver shops also operate paper gold in addition to selling gold jewelry. (7) Others who also operate gold trading, such as 1. Shen Zhuang, 2. Enterprises or industrial companies, 3. Factories, 4. Yarn shops, etc.

### Jin Zongcheng and Others Accused of Concealing Enemy Capital - Half of the Shares of Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving are Japanese Shares

[Report from our newspaper] Jin Zongcheng, the person in charge of Guangzhong Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Factory Co., Ltd., and Ding Anzhi and Ning Xiaoquan, the supervisors of the company, have recently been sued by shareholders Zhao Moushu, Ji Lin, Zhao Linhua and others to the civil court of the district court for concealing enemy capital, reducing the total amount of shares, fabricating account books, reporting illegal resolutions, and illegally amending the articles of association to elect directors and supervisors. They requested that the court declare the resolutions invalid. The case was heard in the Seventh Civil Court of the district court yesterday. Except for Jin Zongcheng, the other defendants did not appear. As a result, the court ordered the judgment to be announced on the 10th of this month. According to the complaint, "The initial total amount of shares of Guangzhong Factory was 60,000 yuan. Later, due to the establishment of three factories, "Second Guangzhong," "Third Guangzhong," and "Seventh Guangzhong," the total amount of shares was 1.64 million yuan, which were registered separately. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the board of directors resolved to increase the capital by 360,000 yuan, bringing the total amount of shares to 2 million yuan. In the 29th year, the capital was increased to 2.5 million yuan. After the fall of Shanghai, it was increased to 5 million yuan. It was found that when the capital was increased from 2 million yuan to 2.5 million yuan, Ito and Pen Er each joined with 500,000 yuan of shares, and when the capital was increased from 2.5 million yuan to 5 million yuan, Ito and Yamaguchi each joined with 1.25 million yuan of shares. From this time on, the old shares of Guangzhong and the enemy capital were half each. The former manager Zhang Xuansheng was prosecuted by the High Procuratorate for the crime of traitor and is now on the run. At 3:00 PM on the 20th of last month, Jin Zongcheng, as the chairman, convened a shareholders' meeting and reported that the company's share capital was only 2 million yuan. He did not report on the previous capital increases and the enemy capital part, but said that the shares had now been increased to 20 million yuan and that all the increased shares would be given to the old shareholders. When some shareholders raised questions, Jin had already arranged for many people to openly insult the shareholders and cause trouble, hindering them from speaking. Therefore, the order of the meeting was greatly disrupted, and the meeting ended in a hurry."

### Fox Spirit Haunting?

Qingxiang Cotton Weaving Factory, located at No. 476 Jianguo East Road, has experienced a series of strange fires in the past three days. It is reported that the losses amount to a huge 150 million yuan, and the police are currently investigating. The factory was established in the 29th year of the Republic of China and has two two-story buildings. It employs 30 to 40 workers, producing "Qianmen Brand" undershirts, cotton knit shirts, and thermal shirts, with thriving business. The factory owner is Li Jiqing from Zhenjiang. At around 6:00 AM on the 4th, the factory's warehouse, specifically the front building on the second floor, suddenly caught fire. Fortunately, the factory had a large workforce, and the fire was quickly extinguished, but the goods burned resulted in losses of 40 to 50 million yuan. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 AM on the 5th, the same warehouse caught fire again, and was extinguished with great effort, preventing a major disaster. However, upon inspection, the losses amounted to another 100 million yuan. At this point, the people in the factory were extremely surprised by the strange fires. The factory owner's wife went to a fortune teller to ask for guidance. The blind fortune teller made grand claims, saying that it was the work of a fox spirit haunting the place. He also said "no more than two, then three," meaning there would be one more fire. The owner's wife then sought ways to resolve the situation, so they invited Taoist priests, made a ruckus all day, and spent over a hundred million yuan, fully expecting to be safe and sound from then on. Who knew that yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, the account books in the factory's accounting office suddenly caught fire again, but were fortunately put out immediately. It can be said to be very strange. The factory fires are bizarre, with losses exceeding 100 million.

### Son Traffics, Father Sells, Poisoning the Nation, Wang Xianzong and Wang Yuwei, Both Convicted and Sent for Trial

[Reported by This Newspaper] Wang Xianzong and Wang Yuwei, father and son, were accused of being suspected of being traitors and trafficking drugs. The investigation court of the High Court interrogated them yesterday afternoon. Wang Xianzong has twelve buildings on Lujiabang Road in the South City. After the Japanese invaders occupied the area, he planned to preserve his property and lent part of it to Li Jinfa (also known as Li Xiaocun), who held a puppet military position, colluding with the Japanese invaders Kawada and Kishida, and ordering his son Wang Yuwei to receive training at the puppet navy training school. After graduating in January of the 29th year of the Republic of China, he immediately served as a squad leader at the school, staying there to assist in training new recruits, and later served as a regular squad leader on the puppet Haixing warship. At that time, the enemy invaders were plotting to subvert our country. Wang Xianzong and his son Wang Yuwei, under their protection, condoned the trafficking of heroin and opium. The son transported it from Tianjin and Hankou, and the father sold it at home, in order to make huge profits. After being reported by the Central Statistics Bureau, the case was transferred by the Shanghai District Procuratorate to the High Procuratorate for investigation. The High Procuratorate filed a public prosecution based on Article 2, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 and Clause 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors, and Article 3, Paragraph 1 and 2, first section, of the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Opium Suppression and Drug Prohibition. The case was heard in the High Court yesterday. The defendant did not deny receiving training at the puppet navy training school, but strongly denied trafficking drugs. After the court hearing, it was announced that the trial would be adjourned to a later date, and the defendants were returned to custody.

### Driven by Greed, Murdering the Cook, The Murder Case of the Male Corpse in Pudong Solved, A Deputy Platoon Leader and Two Soldiers Arrested in Shanghai and Suzhou, Confessing that the Platoon Leader Instigated the Crime

[Reported by This Newspaper] On the 23rd of last month, a male corpse was found in a small creek near the Li Family Residence in Zhangjialou, Yangjing, Pudong, covered in blood and flesh, a truly tragic sight. Later, the branch bureau reported the information to the General Bureau, and the detective department sent employee Chen Xianrong to investigate. A piece of paper with the address of No. 711 Shantang Street, Suzhou, was found next to the deceased, and the case was finally solved based on this sole clue.

The deceased's name was Guo Ruixue, 41 years old, from Hebei Province. He was the cook for Ning Jiuyu, the battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Independent Regiment of the First Pacification District (whose home was at No. 711 Shantang Street, Suzhou). Four days before the murder (i.e., the 19th), he was ordered by the battalion commander's wife to take four gold rings, four cartons of cigarettes, and a Zhengda Pig Bank check from Suzhou, with a face value of 1,065,000 yuan, to Shanghai to be delivered to the battalion commander. Unexpectedly, when the train arrived at the Zhenru Station, soldiers from a certain battalion of the 436th Regiment of the 146th Brigade of the 21st Division stationed there mistook him for a deserter and detained him. Upon inspection, the aforementioned items were found, and they were overcome by greed. At around 9:00 PM on the 21st, they took the deceased to Pudong under the pretext of escorting him to the headquarters. Guo was brutally murdered with a knife in the wilderness near the Li Family Residence in Zhangjialou, and his face was severely disfigured to avoid identification in the future. Finally, the corpse was moved and thrown into the small creek. However, heaven's net is vast, and the corpse floated up on the 23rd. At the same time, the police found a piece of paper next to his body. The same evening, the section chief sent officers Chen Xianrong, Sun Zhenying, Xu Youjin, and Cui Xiaoyun to Suzhou by train to investigate the address, and finally obtained some clues. They also learned that the due date of the check issued by Zhengda Pig Bank was the 27th, so the police officers stayed in Suzhou to wait. At around 1:00 PM that afternoon, Zhang Shangzhen, the deputy platoon leader of the regiment, took the check to Zhengda Pig Bank to request encashment, and he was immediately arrested. After interrogation, he confessed everything, admitting to murdering for money, and also confessed that the instigator was Platoon Leader Shan Shuyun. He also said that there were nine other accomplices, including the soldier Tian Wenbin. After receiving the confession, the police officers telegraphed Shanghai to inform them and escorted Zhang to Shanghai. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Police Bureau immediately dispatched troops to Pudong in conjunction with the Garrison Command to arrest the platoon leader and others. However, they had already fled after hearing the news. Only one of the murderers, Tian Wenbin, was subsequently captured at the Xinruyi bathhouse on Tongbei Road. His confession was the same as Zhang's. All the gold rings had been cashed and distributed by the platoon leader. The case has now been fully investigated and transferred to the Garrison Command for interrogation.

### Section Chief of Gaoqiao Police Bureau Suspected of Corruption, Awaiting Interrogation

[Reported by This Newspaper] Cao Yanwen, the section chief of the Second Section of the Gaoqiao Police Branch Bureau, was recently reported by Inspector Fang Zuhuan of the Police Bureau, who claimed that Cao had extorted money from Tao Chunsheng and Wang Wensheng and engaged in corrupt activities. After an investigation by the General Bureau, the entire case was transferred to the District Procuratorate for further investigation. According to the investigation report of the Police Bureau, the investigators summoned Tao Chunsheng and Tao Huangshi, who claimed that Cao Yanwen had accused Tao Chunsheng of receiving stolen goods in August of last year, took him to the bureau for detention, and extorted 1.1 million French currency before allowing him to be released on bail. The bribe was allegedly received by a person surnamed Lei in the duty room of the bureau. According to Cao Yanwen, Yang Mingkui, the manager of the Wusong Seaside Hotel, had reported Tao Chunsheng and Wang Wensheng for stealing bathtubs and long stools from his hotel, so he summoned Tao and Wang to the bureau for interrogation. Later, due to insufficient evidence of a crime, he ordered them to be released on bail and denied any detention or extortion. However, he said that there was an employee named Lai Bingyan in the duty room, who might be the person surnamed Lei mentioned by Tao Chunsheng. This person has now left the job, and the prosecutor will pursue and interrogate him.

### Racecourse Bond Case, Defendant Appeals, Case Concluded, Appellee Files a Counterclaim, Requesting Repayment at Three Thousand Times the Original Amount

[Reported by This Newspaper] After the Civil Court of the District Court ruled that the racecourse bond case should be repaid at one thousand times the original amount, Fan Keling, the legal representative of the racecourse association, appealed to the High Court, dissatisfied with the verdict. The court opened yesterday. Cai Wenda, the lawyer representing Fan Keling, stated the reasons for the appeal to the court, with four points: (1) The judgment to repay pre-war bonds at one thousand times the original amount will stimulate price increases. (2) The government is currently seeking to contract the currency and suppress prices. If the court rules to increase payments for pre-war debts, it will further promote currency inflation. (3) The racecourse issues bonds to repay debts, not for production, so it is different from deposits, and its business is currently suspended, unable to bear the burden of repayment at one thousand times the original amount. (4) The government has not acknowledged any changes in the pre-war and post-war monetary systems, so it is not convenient to increase payments. The lawyer representing the three appellees, Di Baisi and others, filed a counterclaim in court, stating that the US exchange rate was only 3,000 yuan when the District Court pronounced the verdict, but it is now 12,000 yuan, requesting repayment at three thousand times the original amount. After the debate was concluded, the court will announce the verdict in ten days.

### The Cradle of the New Navy, The Naval Officer School Prepares to Move to Qingdao, Currently Has 186 Students, Graduates in Four Years with the Rank of Ensign

[Reported by This Newspaper] Currently, there are 186 young people across the country receiving the highest education in the naval field. This institution is the Naval Officer School, located in Gaochangmiao. It is also the cradle of China's only new navy. It is expected that the first batch of new people will be able to formally join the ranks of China's new navy during the summer vacation of the 38th year.

The Shanghai Naval Officer School was established in the summer of last year, and its training methods and all equipment are American-style. However, it has recently been ordered to prepare to move to Qingdao. This matter may be realized during the summer vacation of this year. Therefore, the various measures originally planned by the school have to be put on hold, waiting for the expansion to take place after moving to Qingdao. The United States has assisted in the establishment of seven experimental laboratories and one experimental factory at the Naval Officer School. The equipment has been gradually concentrated in Qingdao. It is expected that the Naval Officer School will be able to carry forward and lay a good foundation for the new navy of Zhu Lai under Sino-US cooperation.

The Naval Officer School is directly under the Naval Headquarters. The level of entry is high school graduation and those with equivalent qualifications are eligible. The age is stipulated to be between 17 and 20 years old. Because the Navy has strict requirements for physical fitness, those suffering from myopia, color blindness, and trachoma are all eliminated. The entire program is divided into four years, which is equivalent to a regular university. After graduation, they will be assigned to various monitoring jobs and classified as ensigns. Currently, in addition to providing food, clothing, and housing, students in school receive a monthly subsidy of 45,000 yuan.

In the past, the majority of students were from Guangdong and Fujian. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation in various provinces last year, it was not easy to send students. Therefore, due to geographical reasons, Zhejiang accounted for the first place, followed by Hunan and Jiangxi.

Recently, the authorities have also planned to establish a naval officer accelerated training class, which will accommodate naval soldiers and outstanding members of the Youth Army who have been sent to the UK and the US for internships during the War of Resistance, as well as students who graduated from naval schools before the war, re-concentrating their training and completing their entire studies to create a unified basic cadre for the future new navy. However, this matter will also have to wait until the Naval Officer School returns to Qingdao before it can be established.

### Numerous Labor Disputes Still Exist in Various Industries

[Reported by This Newspaper] Due to the dumping of American rayon thread in the knitting industry in November of last year, business was slow. Labor and management agreed that employee wages would be calculated at 85% temporarily to save the situation. The agreement was for four months, expiring at the end of February of this year. Because business has improved recently, employees have requested that management pay the full amount and that the difference be paid in arrears. However, there has been no response to date. If this is not met, they plan to petition the Social Affairs Bureau.

The Yongxin Weaving Factory on Taikang Road closed down at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. Yesterday, more than 50 workers from the factory petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the factory be ordered to resume work. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently mediating.

The life of workers in the tanning industry is difficult. Their wages are less than 100,000 yuan per month for adults, and only thousands of yuan for apprentices. However, working hours sometimes exceed 17 hours. On October 28th of last year, labor and management signed a written record at the Social Affairs Bureau to adjust working hours and wages. However, management has not fulfilled this to date. The labor side recently submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau to appeal, requesting that the management be ordered to comply.

Workers in the paint group of the red and white wood furniture industry went on strike on the 2nd of this month because their request to increase wages from 6,800 yuan to 18,000 yuan per day was not met. The Social Affairs Bureau is currently mediating.

The enamel department of the Thai-made enamel factory recently implemented "slow work" because the factory fired a worker. They now coat only 400 pieces when they could originally coat 1,000 pieces. The management has submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, planning to shut down the furnace and dismiss all the workers from the 5th onwards.

The Weida Enamel Factory announced at the beginning of the year that it was suspending work due to transferring to others, and has been suspended since. The factory has more than 90 workers. Yesterday, they sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting that the factory resume work, otherwise they would request relief funds.

Employees of the Fuxin Flour Mill No. 2, No. 7, No. 8, and the Huafeng Flour Mill recently submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, accusing management of failing to fulfill the annual record of increasing base salaries by two yuan, requesting that the management be ordered to comply.

### Rickshaw Owner Accused of Fraud, Scheme to Resell Replacements Exposed

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yao Fuqing, the owner of the Qingchang Rickshaw Company at No. 112 Liuhe Road, was recently reported to the police bureau for selling rickshaw licenses with the same number. After investigation, the police verified the facts. He was arrested and scheduled to be transferred to the District Procuratorate for interrogation today. Yao deliberately falsely claimed on December 4th of last year that he had lost a rickshaw license numbered 9263. After publishing a notice of cancellation in the newspaper, he applied for a replacement from the Municipal Public Works Bureau. In fact, he had sold the original to Lin Ruyou at No. 16 Yongqing Lane, Xikang Road, for a price of 500,000 yuan. On the 27th of last month, Yao again intended to sell the replacement rickshaw license, along with a rickshaw in 80% new condition, to Yin Dengtang from Jiancheng. The price was agreed to be 4.15 million yuan, and Yin paid a deposit of 100,000 yuan. Yin did not go to pay the balance the next day, so Yao sold it again to Chen Agen at No. 81 Yepin Lane, Xikang Road, with the car price increasing to 4.7 million yuan, and received a deposit of 2 million yuan. Afterwards, Yin learned about the previous situation and negotiated with Yao. Yao replied that he was past the deadline and ignored him, and also refused to return the deposit he had paid. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, Yin unintentionally discovered two rickshaws with the same license number on Xikang Road, near Macau Road. The license number was the same as the one he wanted to buy, 9263. He knew something was wrong and reported the information to the Police Bureau's Detective Division. Officer Feng Xiushan was dispatched to investigate and summoned Yao Fuqing, who then confessed everything. He was arrested and transferred to the District Procuratorate for handling.

### Interlude in the Fuxing Island Case, Generous Foreman, Sells Gold and is Arrested

[Reported by This Newspaper] Jin Zhensheng, who came to Shanghai from northern Jiangsu as a refugee in January of last year, was introduced to the Fuxing Island Fisheries Management Office as a foreman.

Random Notes on the Basketball Scene
In the basketball league, the two strongest teams of the Chinese team, Ren Yu and Shan team, met and tied at the end. In overtime, the Shan team narrowly won by one point.

Ren Yu is still a team that can psychologically manipulate their skills. This is due to experience and expertise. Although the championship is out of reach this year, Ren Yu is still a team with the most potential.

The Shan team maintained its "fast" characteristic last night, while Ren Yu stuck to the rules. In the first half, He Lide of the Shan team found an opportunity and performed exceptionally, scoring repeatedly. The score increased to 17-10. The Ren Yu players panicked. Wu Xinyun, Wang Huaiting, and Yao Wenyit repeatedly missed sure shots. Only Shen Pengju was in normal form. The first half ended with a score of 19-10, with Ren Yu trailing.

In the second half, Liang Yongjia entered the game, and the morale stabilized. He rebounded under the basket, shuttled and passed, created a smokescreen, and shot quickly, showing his skills. Wang Huaiting, Yao Wenyit, and Liang Yongjia successively scored, especially Xiao Yao's two corner shots, which won applause. Ren Yu then went from 19-12 to 23-18, forcing a tie at 24 each. At this time, there were still four minutes left in the game, but neither side scored, resulting in a tie.

In the five-minute overtime, Lin Weicong scored. Ren Yu only scored one point from Shen Pengju's free throw. Ren Yu's morale was chaotic. The Shan team remained calm and ultimately won the game.

When the score was tied at 24 each, Yao Wenyit took a long shot before the buzzer rang. The ball hit the rim and bounced out. Otherwise, this shot could have determined the winner. Is this what they call the ball is like that? (Chang Nian)

Purchase Price of Drawnwork Fails to Cover Costs; Textile Management Committee to Find a Solution and Expedite the Issuance of Foreign Cotton Allocation Certificates for Various Yarn Factories
[Reported by this newspaper] The 27th regular meeting of the Textile Management Committee was held yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Government Conference Hall. In addition to the attending committee members, Zhang Yamin and Zhang Hanguang of the Garrison Headquarters' Yarn and Cloth Group also attended. The agenda items discussed were as follows: (1) The purchase price of cotton yarn for February, with the standard 20-count yarn set at 2.5 million yuan, was considered insufficient by various private factories based on current costs such as cotton and labor. Chairman Wu expressed that he would consider a solution and suggested that the authorities resolve the issue. (2) Regarding the portion of cotton yarn that factories can freely trade, private factories faced difficulties in replenishing raw cotton. If price controls were too strict, factories would be unable to produce. After discussion, it was agreed that private factories should list prices that were not too far from those of the Textile Construction Company. A solution would be sought after the central government issued price negotiation measures. (3) Regarding the expediting of foreign cotton allocation certificates, it was decided that the Textile Management Committee would urge the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee and the Four-Organization Headquarters to issue them quickly to various yarn factories. (4) Regarding the Southbound Yarn and Cloth case, the discussion was as follows: It was found that in January, the quota for southbound shipment of cotton yarn was 5,546 pieces and cotton cloth was 233,299 bolts. Various manufacturers had applied sequentially, and a total of 4,752 pieces of cotton yarn and 76,880 bolts of cotton cloth had been approved, leaving a surplus of 794 pieces of cotton yarn and 56,419 bolts of cotton cloth. In addition, a special increase of 2,400 pieces of cotton yarn and 59,679 bolts of cotton cloth was added. Within the quota, the applications for southbound shipment of cotton yarn totaled 2,089 pieces and cotton cloth totaled 9,250 bolts, leaving a surplus of 311 pieces of yarn and 50,429 bolts of cloth. It was proposed to merge this surplus with the February quota and redistribute it. In the ordinary case, the original quota was 2,967 pieces of cotton yarn, plus the monthly surplus of 794 pieces, for a total of 3,761 pieces. The original quota was 75,647 bolts of cotton cloth, plus the monthly surplus of 56,419 bolts, for a total of 132,066 bolts. In the special case, the original quota was 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn, plus the monthly surplus of 311 pieces, for a total of 2,311 pieces. The original quota was 35,000 bolts of cotton cloth, plus the monthly surplus of 50,429 bolts, for a total of 85,429 bolts.

[Another Report] In the future, the management of national cotton yarn prices will be decided by the Price Committee of the National Economic Commission, and then implemented by the Textile Management Committee.

(3) The Textile Construction Company has not sold 20-count Blue Phoenix and Water Moon cotton yarn since the last listing on February 15th.

Export Promotion Committee Attaches Importance to Export Smuggling Problem, Mostly Transshipped Abroad via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway
Since the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, the city's export business has remained stagnant. According to the person in charge of the Import and Export Industry Association, there are many difficult problems in promoting exports at present. The short time limit for foreign exchange settlement is felt to be impossible to develop. Furthermore, a large amount of exported materials have recently been found to be smuggled via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and transshipped abroad, which has had a major impact on Shanghai's export trade.

According to the person in charge of the secretariat of the Export Promotion Committee, the committee attaches great importance to the problem of export smuggling and plans to invite experts to form a special research committee to discuss countermeasures. However, now that the chairman of the executive committee, Bei Zuyi, has resigned, the problem can be decided after the new chairman takes office in the coming days.

It is also learned that the main reason for smuggling export goods is to evade taxes. It is said that the main goods being smuggled are green tea and tung oil.

Foreign Rice and Cotton Arrive in Shanghai
[Reported by this newspaper] The Aiet Hua Jieni Beilan, managed by the Fule Company, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from the port of Mei Sheng Duo Si, carrying 32,500 bags of foreign rice, 47,400 bags of beans, and 15,000 pieces of cotton, which are goods from the Relief Administration.

Also, a large amount of flour is arriving in Shanghai this week.

Banks and Firms Need to Suspect Assisting Productive Enterprises; The Central Bank Decides to Make a Final Loan; Rediscount and Re-mortgage Methods Remain Effective
Recently, there have been many comments on the Central Bank's failure to connect with commercial banks and firms and to fulfill its responsibilities as the bank of banks. To this end, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Central Bank. According to him, the bank does not make any form of loans to commercial banks and firms according to laws and regulations. However, when general commercial banks and firms are well-managed, especially when they need financial accommodation to assist productive enterprises, the bank can consider the actual situation and be the "lender of last resort" for each bank and firm. This kind of "last resort lending" fulfills the responsibility of the bank of banks. Last year, the method of handling rediscount, re-pledge, and re-pledge of exchange was established. In addition to the city, it has been widely implemented throughout the country. It is handled by commercial banks and firms organizing a banking syndicate. The industrial and commercial loan syndicate established by the banks and firms is dedicated to applying to the bank for rediscount and re-mortgage. Recently, the bank has urged the banks and firms to organize a re-pledge exchange syndicate, fully striving for the bank's efforts. Although there have been changes in the personnel of the bank, this method remains effective. However, it is limited to assisting productive enterprises. If it is not a productive enterprise, it is naturally impossible to enjoy this loan, so as to avoid increasing market credit and stimulating prices.

Amendment to Securities Exchange Arbitrage Method
The Securities Exchange previously established a method for managing securities arbitrage, which was amended again yesterday. The amended articles are recorded as follows:

1.  The broker of this institute accepts the customer's entrusted arbitrage transaction, which should be completed in the field, and must not be completed by internal transfer. After the transaction is established, the transaction order or list should be held to the audit department of the business office of this institute for stamping and certification.
2.  The broker's books of this institute should independently indicate the subjects related to arbitrage on behalf of customers, and indicate the words "arbitrage on behalf of customers" and must not be mixed with other subjects.
3.  When the broker of this institute conducts group arbitrage on behalf of customers, the account of each period should be announced to the entrusted persons.
4.  The broker of this institute conducts arbitrage on behalf of customers. In addition to the actual difference obtained from arbitrage, there must be no payment of interest or bonus for the principal delivered by the entrusting party, except for the corporate broker of the bank, money house, or trust company who is entrusted to arbitrage in the name of the broker.

White Coal is Scarce and Firm
The bituminous coal market is still sluggish. Although sellers have automatically reduced asking prices, buyers still have no intention of buying. The overall transaction was very slow. In addition to Hongji and Jiaozuo white coal blocks, which continued to be firm due to scarce arrivals and special sales, other Tongdeli and others were affected by the gradual increase in the arrival of coke, and the market was extremely depressed, with fewer and fewer people asking about them. With the gradual increase in the arrival of coke, market prices are not as chaotic as before. The price of medium coke is 1.3 million yuan, Pingxiang coke, Kaiping coke, 1.05 million yuan, Wusong coke Taiwan coke, 1 million yuan.

Tung Oil Market Remains Weak; Export Volume Decreases Sharply

The export volume (to the United States) from Hong Kong was 490 tons, and that of other merchants was 200 tons. According to the factory's Secretary Che, the export of tung oil has encountered great difficulties after the In. price was lowered.

Yesterday's tung oil market remained weak, with few transactions. The price of Xihong tung oil (domestic sales of tung oil) was 390,000 yuan per barrel of 83 catties including the wooden barrel. The price of Hongjiang tung oil (same weight) was 250,000 yuan per barrel.

According to a merchant who called Hankou long-distance the day before yesterday, there is no market for tung oil in Hankou. The new price after the pound was lowered must be made in three days.

Other papers have also gone downstream uniformly, and domestic prices have stood at the original price, and it is difficult to lower them for a while.

Foreign Tea Houses Had Few Transactions Yesterday
The red and green tea specially supplied for domestic sales has always been in a calm state recently. The reason is that the removal is zero and lacks. Therefore, people's hearts have not been able to prosper. In the foreign tea market, Jane Beauty, Needle Beauty, and other green teas are still asked about, but the market situation is generally similar in supply and demand, and there are few honors and disgraces. As for the black tea that the British house pays attention to, the market was not accommodating at the beginning of Sheng Kai yesterday, and the situation was very bleak. Suddenly, a group of cargo owners who were in urgent need of capital flocked out, and the transaction suddenly opened up, but the number of transactions was still not large. Only Wuchang Tea Company and Renji Foreign Firm had micro transactions in the whole city, and the selling price was slightly softer than the day before.

US Tung Oil Production Increases Greatly; Last Year, 47,000 Tons of Tung Seeds Were Produced
[Associated Press Boston, 5th] The Christian Science Monitor recently reported that the United States' tung oil production will create a new record. A total of 12 million tung trees have been planted. According to statistics published by the Department of Morning Industry, the United States harvested less than one ton of tung seeds in 1924, reached 6,100 tons in 1943, and last year's output exceeded 47,000 tons, making it one of the fastest-growing of the 52 major agricultural products. Seven thousand tons of tung oil can be refined from 47,000 tons of tung seeds, which is about one-thirtieth of the US paint industry's demand this year, or one-tenth of the pre-war tung oil exports from China to the United States. It is said that China's Yangtze River Basin, from Hankou to Yichang, produces about 150,000 tons of tung oil annually. After the outbreak of the war, China's tung oil exports ceased. Under the Japanese occupation for eight years, few new tung trees were planted, and the old tung trees were almost completely felled. Therefore, the current tung seed production has been sharply reduced, and China's domestic demand is severe. It is unlikely that there will be a large amount of exports in the next few years.

New Medicine and New Drugs Shanghai Medical Association Editor's Occasional Thoughts Fan Shouyuan
The general public and our doctors often have different psychological concepts about the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.

The general public always believes that doctors can see everything clearly at a glance, and after an examination, they will have a definite diagnosis of what disease it is and explain it. The doctor's ability is like Zhang Tianshi. The doctor's two eyeballs are microscopes. As for the medicine, needless to say, what medicine should be used for what disease. If the medicine doesn't cure the disease, it must also reduce the disease, which is a matter of course.

Conversely, doctors don't have it so easy when it comes to diagnosing diseases and using medicines. There are indeed many diseases that can be easily diagnosed. After an examination, a diagnosis is made and it is known what disease it is. It is also common. However, there are also many cases where the diagnosis remains vague and inexplicable after examining for ten days or eight days, which is not uncommon.

When it comes to using medicine, it is only natural that there are only waiting and no special symptomatic medicines to be applied during the undiagnosed examination period. Even after the diagnosis is clear and the condition is clear, it is often not necessary to use any medicine for treatment, which is also a reasonable treatment. Because treating diseases does not rely solely on medicines. Medicines need to be used when medicine is needed to see the function of the medicine. When medicine is not needed, medicine should not be used. Using more medicine may instead harm the sick body.

However, the general patient often cannot hold the same concept as the doctor about diagnosing diseases and using medicines. They often have a different psychology from our doctors.

The general public's concept of medicine is really necessary to be eliminated.

Because this kind of concept of medicine is extremely unreasonable and extremely unscientific, it only harms the patient's body and has no benefit.

Immunity to Smallpox Yu Yunxiu
What is immunity? It should be explained here! Epidemic is an infectious disease, like smallpox, measles, cholera, plague, typhoid fever, etc., are all infectious diseases, can also be called epidemic. Immunity is to avoid infectious diseases. When an infectious disease comes to invade, there is resistance, not being contaminated. This is immunity. It's like the world says after getting smallpox, one will never get it again, after getting measles, one will never get it again, after getting typhoid fever, one will never get it again, after injecting cholera vaccine, one can avoid getting cholera, after smallpox vaccination, one can avoid getting smallpox. This is all about immunity.

Now only talk about immunity to smallpox; smallpox has smallpox, artificially inoculated smallpox, artificially inoculated cowpox. Smallpox is commonly known as smallpox. It is a pox disease that is naturally transmitted. Artificially inoculated smallpox is to use the scab of a good smallpox to inoculate in the body of the child, teach him to be infected and develop smallpox. From the end of the Ming Dynasty to before the prevalence of cowpox vaccination, this method was used. Now all use artificial vaccination with cowpox. What I want to write about involves all three kinds. Some talk about immunity to smallpox, some talk about immunity to artificially inoculated smallpox, some talk about immunity to cowpox vaccination.

1.  Susceptibility
    Susceptibility is when an epidemic smallpox poison comes to invade, our body's sensing and acceptance of being infected. It can be simply divided into three items: (A) Fetuses are susceptible to infection; if a pregnant woman gets smallpox, the fetus in the womb will also develop smallpox. Not only that, if the mother still has resistance (immunity) to smallpox, when the smallpox poison enters the mother's blood, the mother will not develop smallpox, but the smallpox poison in the blood can pass through the placenta (commonly called the umbilical cord) and cause the fetus to develop smallpox. (B) Newborns are also susceptible to infection; Joachimann has already

At this time, Shen Pengju and He Lide were fighting for control of the ball, and at 9 to 7, Ren Yu took a time-out. Ma Canxi of the Shantou team won the ball and, along with Chen Qingjiang and Cai Yanli, added six points, making it 16 to 10. Because it was related to the championship, the competition was extremely intense. At 17 to 10, Ren Yu took another time-out to discuss strategies. Chen Qingjiang then broke through, and Shantou took the lead with 19 to 10 in the first half. Shantou's defenders were competent, and the forwards were more fortunate with their shots than Ren Yu.

Desperate Chase

In the second half, Liang Yongjia of Ren Yu came on the court, and Yao Wenyi scored three shots, while Shen and Wang Huaiting also made good shots. The score increased suddenly to 23 to 20. Shantou only led by 3 points, so Ji Lankang was brought in to replace Lin Weizong. Cai Yanxiong made a penalty, making it 24 to 20. Liang Yongjia of Ren Yu made a long drive, and it was a success, 24 to 22, trailing by only 2 points. The spectators in the stands each had their favorites, and the shouts were deafening. One minute later, Liang scored again, making it a 24-point tie (5 minutes remaining). The referee announced at 4 minutes, Sun Guozheng was penalized, and Xu Zhongyi entered as a substitute. Shantou missed two free throws (Lin, He), which was a pity. Wu Xinyun of Ren Yu also called out Xu Zhongyi, who had been substituted. At that time, there were only 20 seconds left. At the last moment, Yao Wenyi missed a long shot, and when the bell rang, it was a 24-point tie.

Overtime

The overtime period of 5 minutes would decide the winner. Lin Weilu healed to the right and penetrated, scoring an empty-hearted ball, so he wanted to steadily advance to pass the time.
