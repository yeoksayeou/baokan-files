### Bitter Fighting in Siping Continues: City Buildings Destroyed by Artillery Fire; Fierce Battles South of Changchun at Pingdingshan

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] The Battle of Siping has been raging day and night for the past three days. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented since the recovery of the Northeast. Both the Nationalists and the Communists know that this battle is crucial to their success or failure, and they are fighting hard to achieve victory. The street fighting in Siping City, involving hand-to-hand combat, is proceeding with extreme brutality on the 18th. Only a few major buildings remain standing in the city, with the rest destroyed by artillery fire and bombs. Civilian casualties are very high, and the Communist forces call it a war of annihilation.

[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 18th] The fierce battle of Siping has continued for a week. The Communist forces have launched repeated fierce attacks, breaking through twice, but have not succeeded. The Communist forces' offensive from the south has been the most intense, resulting in daily casualties of up to 20,000 men, with corpses piled up like mountains. The Communist 1st and 2nd Divisions were routed during the attack on the airfield, suffering over 3,000 casualties. The Nationalist 1st and 2nd Security Brigades also suffered extremely heavy losses. The airfield remains under the control of the Nationalists. The air force has provided assistance in the battle, exerting maximum power, causing the invading Communist forces to suffer losses.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] Wang Shuming flew to Nanjing in the afternoon of the 18th. Also, in the bitter fighting at Siping, the Nationalist forces rely on the air force to supply hand grenades.

Nationalist Forces Advance Towards Benxi; Situation Stabilizes in Yingkou Area

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] In the Benxi area, Nationalist forces have launched an offensive around Benxi for the past 48 hours. In a battle near Hualianzhai, northwest of Benxi, over a thousand Communist soldiers were captured, and many were killed or wounded. They continued to press towards Benxi. A unit of Communist forces was discovered southeast of Fushun on the 18th, showing signs of attempting to harass the area. Furthermore, Zheng Dongguo went to inspect the area northwest of Benxi along the Shenyang-Anshan line on the 16th, and returned to Shenyang on the same day, reportedly to arrange for a counter-offensive on Benxi. Reinforcements are also being sent in succession.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] At Dashiqiao on the southern section of the China Changchun Railway, Nationalist forces have withdrawn and are confronting each other at Laobianshan, southwest of the town, on the 18th. Nationalist forces in Haicheng launched an attack on the 18th, with the air force providing assistance. They also plan to repair the bridge between the Fen Shuiba Shan stations, which was destroyed by the Communist forces. The situation in Yingkou stabilized on the 18th, and passenger trains heading south are running to Haicheng.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] Haicheng reports that after Communist forces from Suinan invaded Gaiping, they divided into two groups on the 16th and advanced towards Dashiqiao (184 kilometers north of Shenyang and 23 kilometers west of Yingkou), the intersection of the China Changchun Railway and the Yingkou branch line. Fierce fighting broke out around Niangniangmiao and Hongqishan, three kilometers southwest of Dashiqiao, at midnight. After inflicting heavy casualties on the invading Communist forces, the Nationalist forces withdrew to new positions at 5:00 AM on the 17th. Before dawn, Communist forces briefly infiltrated Dashiqiao station but were quickly annihilated by the Nationalist forces. Fierce fighting is now taking place in the suburbs of Dashiqiao.

[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 18th] The Changchun Sweeping Corps engaged in a fierce battle with over 2,000 Communist soldiers at Pingdingshan and Xinkaihe, 20 kilometers south of Changchun, on the morning of the 18th. Fighting was still ongoing at noon. Furthermore, over 2,000 Communist soldiers have infiltrated San Shengyu, northwest of Nongan. Jin Tu is not.

[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 18th] The Nationalist forces on the Jilin-Changchun Line are facing threats from the southeast and are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Communist forces near Tumenling and Bonihezi. The security regiments guarding Huapichang and Yatong River have retreated to Tumenling. A large number of Communist forces have gathered near Yang, attempting to invade Jiutai.

Sweeping Operations on the Jilin-Changchun Line Achieve Victory; Nationalist Forces are Pursuing on Multiple Routes

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 18th] The Communist forces in Wulajie are advancing south very rapidly. Fierce fighting has been taking place for days in the area of Shangxiatongqi, north of Jiuzhan (the second station from Jilin on the Jilin-Changchun Railway line). The Communist forces are using intense firepower to launch fierce attacks south, but our forces are waiting in a position of strength and responding calmly. The Communist forces have suffered heavy casualties, are unable to sustain the attack, and are slowly retreating north. By noon on the 17th, our advance troops had reached the area of Shangxiatongqi, over 20 kilometers north of Jiuzhan.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 17th] Military Intelligence: According to a comprehensive assessment of recent military activities on both sides of the Jilin-Changchun line, it is evident that the Communist forces intend to cut off traffic between Jilin and Changchun in order to threaten these cities and support Siping. However, the Nationalist forces in Changchun, Jiuhe, and Jilin have long been aware of this and have dispatched sweeping forces to launch attacks on multiple routes in the triangular area south of the Jilin line. The Gu Dianzi station west of Jilin, which was briefly captured by Communist forces on the morning of the 15th, was retaken. The Communist forces then retreated in disarray towards Dahhuangdi. The Nationalist forces attacking from Jiutai swept to the vicinity of Huapichang and engaged in fierce battles with the Communist forces. By the 16th, the Communist forces were unable to sustain the attack and retreated. This unit of Nationalist forces then joined up with the Nationalist forces advancing west from Jilin. Although there was also Communist activity near Tumenling, and the Communist forces in Dahhuangdi were still considering advancing south, the Nationalist sweeping forces have tightly controlled the area. The Nationalist sweeping forces south of the railway line advanced to Chalukou on the morning of the 16th, and the Communist forces scattered and retreated in disarray. The Nationalist forces are currently pursuing on multiple routes.

### Nationalist Forces Launch Counter-Offensive on the Northern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway; Outcome of the War Situation Expected in Two Weeks; Troops Breaking Through After the Fall of Cangxian Arrive in Tianjin

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] Amidst the swirling smoke of war around Beiping and Tianjin, Wang Hongshao, Chief of Staff of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, stated: "The outcome of the war on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway should be clear within two weeks. After the Nationalist reinforcements arrive, the situation on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be turned from danger to safety. He does not believe the Communist forces have any intention of occupying Tianjin, because the Nationalist forces are adopting a strategy of annihilating the main force of the Communist forces, while the Communist forces are avoiding the main force." Tianjin is where the main force of the Nationalist forces is located, and it is believed that the Communist forces would not dare to attempt such a thing. He also judges that the main objectives of the Communist forces' recent disturbances in Hebei province are twofold: (1) to infiltrate major strongholds, and (2) to take the opportunity to expand the "Liberated Areas" along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in preparation for future operations in Shandong. However, he does not believe that the Communist forces will be able to infiltrate the Northeast in the future, because they would have to break through multiple lines of defense, including the Beiping-Tianjin Railway, the eastern section of the Beiping-Liaoning Railway, the Great Wall Line, and the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] After the Nationalist forces launched a counter-offensive on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway yesterday, they made significant progress. By last night, the troops advancing on the front line had retaken Tangguantun after fierce fighting, while another unit bypassed the area and continued south. It is reported that Ye Jianying is directing Communist forces in Liushui Town, more than ten kilometers north of Qingxian. Furthermore, approximately one division of Gao Shuxun's troops is making moves towards Cangxian.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] Military Intelligence: On the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Nationalist forces launched an attack on the Communist forces on the 17th, dividing into two routes. One route advanced along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and had reached Zhangguantun, engaging in fierce fighting north of Tangguantun. The other route proceeded south along the Tianjin-Yanshan Highway and, after recapturing Daxiaobozhen, is continuing its advance. Over a hundred wooden boats were discovered at Qikou, a part of Cangxian belonging to Binhai, on the 17th. The area has now become a supply port for materials and ammunition for the Communist forces in Hebei province. Furthermore, fifty wooden boats were discovered at Gaosalingdun, south of Tanggu. Tanggu is stable and safe. Reports that Communist forces had landed near the area are inaccurate.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] It has now been confirmed that Cangxian has been captured by the Communist forces. Over 5,000 armed troops and 3,000-4,000 non-combatants who broke through arrived in Tianjin at 1:30 PM on the 18th.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] The railway between Yangcun and Beicang, near Tianjin, was damaged last night but was repaired on the morning of the 18th, not hindering military transport. Over 5,000 Communist soldiers infiltrated Yixingbu, fifteen kilometers north of Tianjin, yesterday. The military has been paying close attention.

[Local News] According to China National Aviation Corporation, railway traffic between Beiping and Tianjin has been restored. The company has stopped flying the additional temporary flights starting today.

### Zhang Jianfei and Others Arrive in Beiping; Will Go to Nanjing Tomorrow to Report on the Situation in Lushun-Dalian

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] Zhang Jianfei, Zhu Xinmin, Ye Nan, and three other members of the Lushun-Dalian inspection group arrived in Beiping from Shenyang at 4:00 PM on the 18th. They are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the 20th to report to the central government on their inspection. Zhang Jianfei stated that he could not express any opinions before reporting to the central government, and also stated that he had no formal contact with local administrative organizations in Lushun-Dalian. Ye Nan said, "It's always better to see Lushun-Dalian than not to see it." One member of the group jokingly said that the Soviet Union provided them with thorough hospitality and protection. It is reported that after they arrived in Dalian, they were accommodated in the International Friendship Hotel. Soviet warships are docked in Dalian port. No troops were seen in the city, and the police are maintaining order. There are few pedestrians on the streets, but there are many students. However, the market is very depressed. Some buildings are damaged. The city has a population of 600,000.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] Zhang Jianfei flew to Beiping at 1:00 PM on the 18th, transferring to Nanjing to report on the inspection. Ye Nan, Zhu Xinmin, Chen Siyong, Xu Zushan, and others went with him. Dong Yanping canceled his trip due to official business.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 18th] After the return of the Lushun-Dalian inspection group, they avoided revealing any specific information. According to information obtained from the side, the only difficulty encountered by the inspection group was that the Soviet Union invited responsible personnel from the Kwantung Government (which the Nationalist government considers to be a puppet organization), the Dalian and Lushun city governments, and local agencies such as Jin Xian, including Chi Zixiang, Xu Xianqi, Chen Yuntao, and Ren Zhongyi, to participate and give speeches. Chi and others wore formal attire and had smiling faces. Both the speeches and actions were pre-planned. Furthermore, the inspection group also suffered embarrassment when they raised their glasses to celebrate at banquets. Slogans such as "Support Sun Yat-sen's Three Policies of Alliance with Russia" and "Support Sino-Soviet Friendship" were posted in front of the guest house and other places.

### Units for Sale of State-Owned Enterprises Have Been Decided

### Beitashan Belongs to Our Territory; Moscow's Broadcast of Outer Mongolian Statement is Absolutely Absurd; Director Dong Released a Solemn Statement Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the Beitashan incident, Dong Xian Guang, Director of the News Bureau, issued the following statement on behalf of the government on the 18th: "There is no doubt that the Beitashan area is within the borders of Xinjiang Province and is Chinese territory. Whether before or after the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty in 1945, Beitashan has been defended by Xinjiang Province. The area has always had a police station and stationed troops established by the Xinjiang Provincial Government.

I must solemnly deny the point in the Moscow broadcast that Chinese troops crossed the border of Xinjiang and entered Outer Mongolia. The statement by the Outer Mongolian Foreign Minister broadcast by Moscow is absolutely absurd.

I do not want to say more until I receive a formal reply from Outer Mongolia and the Soviet government. I only want to reiterate that the Beitashan incident is not an ordinary border incident or boundary dispute, but is related to political issues of broader significance."

### U.S. Embassy Denies Pravda's Report

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] The U.S. Embassy denied the Soviet Pravda's report that the Xinjiang incident was instigated by the United States on the 18th. According to Melzer, a news officer at the embassy, the U.S. has "no knowledge of" everything reported by the Soviet newspaper.

### There Are Korean Communists and Japanese Prisoners of War in the Communist Forces; Is This What a Purely Internal War Is Like? A Question at the News Bureau Press Conference

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] At the regular press conference held by the Executive Yuan News Bureau at 4:30 PM on the 18th, Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, raised three questions, asking Director Dong to answer them. Pan arrived at the venue when the meeting was halfway through and stated that he was participating as a reporter. When Director Dong introduced Pan, he said that he was a former colleague of Deputy Minister Shen of the Central Propaganda Department and is now the speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council. He then said, "We welcome Speaker Pan to say a few words of goodwill." Pan said, "I am here participating in the capacity of a reporter and have questions to ask Director Dong." Pan continued, "I have just come from Shanghai and saw a printed leaflet titled 'An Authoritative Figure in the Chinese Communist Party Discusses the Current Situation,' with the signature 'Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi, May 30.' What I want to ask is, will the central radio station receive this broadcast? Why can this kind of propaganda be distributed casually here? Its content adds all the phrases of national Qing Dynasty fascism to the government. If it has been received, what attitude should the government take?" When Pan explained, he showed the document to everyone. Dong, after reading it, said that the government has not received this document so far. The best way for the government to deal with this is to ignore it, because once they pay attention to it, they will think that they have gained something. Only by ignoring it will they lose their energy. Dong continued, "In my very quick reading, I believe that this article is not only aimed at the government, but also at stirring up trouble in Sino-American relations." Pan then raised a second question, saying that people generally claim to oppose civil war, and students also say they oppose civil war. We read war reports stating that there are Korean communists and Japanese prisoners of war in the Communist forces in the Northeast, as well as the Beitashan incident. What kind of nature are these incidents? Is this what a purely internal war is like? Dong then read aloud his written statement on the Xinjiang incident (see separate article). Pan then asked a third question, saying, what is the attitude of the United States towards the occurrence of the Xinjiang incident? What is the situation of U.S. aid to China? The United States has agreed to loans to Turkey and Greece, so why is there no result from our country's loans? Dong reiterated his previous response to reporters' inquiries: "The remaining materials from the US$500 million promised by the United States to allow me, by the end of May, only received $20 million worth, a limited number. How much assistance I can get from the United States is obvious. There is no new news regarding the loan." Dong also said, "This is a very 'depressing' matter." Someone asked how the government would respond to the Soviet Union's refusal to allow us to take over Lushun and Dalian? Dong replied, "The government is negotiating. I have no comments to make." Asked whether the government would disclose the truth after the Beitashan incident? Has there been any change in the diplomatic path? The Soviet Union did not reply to our protest. Should we file a complaint with the United Nations? Dong replied, "I have no way to answer."

Situation of Railway Transportation

Xian Guang's Reply to Reporter's Question

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] At the News Bureau press conference on the 18th, a question was asked whether a detailed report could be given comparing the situation of China's transportation lines today with that of ninety days ago.

Director Dong replied: Since the victory, the government has made every effort to restore and maintain important transportation lines. Due to the disturbances and sabotage by the Communist Party and the shortage of materials, this work has been extremely difficult. Destruction is often easy, while construction is difficult. On the 15th, out of 18,097 kilometers of railways nationwide, 10,053 kilometers were open to traffic. Three months ago, 11,468 kilometers were open to traffic. In the past ninety days, the mileage of railways open to traffic in the Northeast has decreased from 3,098 kilometers to 1,858 kilometers due to the impact of the war. During the same period, the Longhai Railway has increased from 1,386 kilometers on March 16 to the current 1,404 kilometers, while the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has increased from 651 kilometers to 671 kilometers. Another noteworthy development is that the 118-kilometer-long Nanxun Railway has been restored to traffic, and the mileage of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway open to traffic has increased from 264 kilometers on March 16 to 422 kilometers on June 15. The comparison of the mileage of railways open to traffic nationwide three months ago and today is listed below:

Comparison of Mileage of Railways Open to Traffic Nationwide Three Months Ago and Currently (in kilometers): (A) Total distance open to traffic on March 16: 11,626, including 3,098 in the Northeast, and (listing only important railways in other areas) 117 on the Jiaoji, 1,050 on the Tianjin-Pukou, 443 on the Beining, 882 on the PingSui, 73 on the Pinggu, 1,386 on the Longhai, 275 on the Zhengtai, 398 on the Tongpu, 339 on the Jinghu, 264 on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, 0 on the Nanxun, and 1,159 on the Yuehan. (The Beining refers to the section within the pass, while the section outside the pass is included in the Northeast item. According to the report on that day, the section within the pass has also been damaged by the Communist forces, and the mileage is unknown). Total distance not open to traffic: 6,317, including 584 in the Northeast, and (listing only important railways in other areas) 338 on the Jiaoji, 478 on the Tianjin-Pukou, 156 on the Pinghan, 190 on the Beining, 320 on the PingSui, 75 on the Pinggu, 210 on the Longhai, 0 on the Zhengtai, 494 on the Tongpu, 3 on the Jinghu, 738 on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, 128 on the Nanxun, and 0 on the Yuehan.

### Ambassador Gu Visits the U.S. Under Secretary of State to Discuss Asian Economic Revival; Negotiations on Sino-American War Debt to Begin Next Week

[News Report] Washington, 17th: Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, visited U.S. Under Secretary of State Clayton on the afternoon of the 17th to discuss nine-tenths of the Chongqing issue and discuss the problem of reviving Asia. It is proposed to extend the "Marshall Plan for Economic Assistance to Europe" to Asia and propose that China share in the compensation plan for domestic industrial assets in Japan.

Suspicion of US$500 Million Loan Being Discussed in Washington

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] Our US$500 million construction loan to the United States is currently being discussed in Washington.

The Ministry of Communications has telegraphed Xiao Qingyun, the representative of the Ministry of Communications of the Chinese Materials Supply Committee in the United States, to assist Gu Weijun in conducting negotiations.

### Starting from All Aspects to Solve the Xinjiang Problem

Liang Han Cao's Speech in Youth League

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 8th] Liang Hancao stated in a public speech on the afternoon of the 18th that Xinjiang is our territory and we vow to defend it. The people of Xinjiang are our compatriots and we should provide relief. If we can do our best, everything will be easily solved. Liang believes that the Xinjiang incident will not develop much further, and a temporary solution can be expected. However, the problem still exists. To seek a thorough solution, we must work hard in diplomacy, internal affairs, and economics. In terms of diplomacy, since the occurrence of this incident involves international relations, the handling should be solemn. As Mencius said, "Those who serve the small with the great are those who fear Heaven, and those who fear Heaven protect their country." We are currently between the United States and the Soviet Union, and our diplomacy should be neutral and impartial. In terms of internal affairs, the ethnic problems in Xinjiang are complicated. We should grasp the mentality of the new people, enable them to enjoy political democracy, and have full opportunity. What compatriots welcome are engineers, medicine, etc., and no longer welcome the ruling figures of the past frontiers "to show great ambitions." The Central Government should assist local people in defending the country and enable the provincial government to embark on a rational path. Finally, in terms of economy, Xinjiang is extremely rich in resources. According to investigations, the Qitai area contains raw materials for manufacturing atomic bombs. In addition, the oil mines in Wusu are also richer than those in Gansu. We should help the local people engage in construction and accelerate the improvement of people's livelihood. If the above points can be achieved, the relationship between the central government and the local government will not be difficult to become closer every day, and other problems will not be difficult to solve accordingly. Liang once served as the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Headquarters and is very enthusiastic about the new situation in Xinjiang. Today, more than a thousand people who admire his name went to listen to his speech at the Central Corps headquarters.

### Interior Ministry Concerned with Techniques for Universal Suffrage

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Zhang Zeren, a technician from the Internal Affairs Ministry's Population Bureau, spoke to reporters on the 18th about the technical challenges in the universal suffrage process, including ballot production, voting, and vote counting. He stated: Universal suffrage is about to begin. According to statistics, there are two hundred million voters nationwide, so the printing of ballots, the number of ballot boxes, the methods of counting votes, etc., will present difficulties in practical implementation. Now, we are conducting the following research: (1) Regarding ballot production, the total number of voters in the twelve special municipalities nationwide is approximately six million or more, requiring 1,200 ballot boxes. The production of these eight million-plus ballots and 1,200 ballot boxes must be planned and managed by the General Election Office, and then provided to the municipal election offices for use. The National Assembly ballots for each county and city bureau should be produced and distributed by the provincial election offices, and must be stamped with the official seal or chop of the provincial office according to regulations. We generally plan to have the provincial offices assign personnel in shifts day and night to stamp the ballots at the fastest possible speed, stamping sixty sheets per minute, or more than sixty thousand sheets per day. Considering that Sichuan Province alone has twenty million ballots, this would require more than three hundred days, which is practically impossible. Therefore, from a practical point of view, we propose that each unit handle the printing separately, with the election offices sending personnel to supervise. (2) Regarding voting, regulations stipulate that voting must be completed within three days. The prescribed ballot box style is rectangular, one foot eight inches high, two feet two inches long, and one foot four inches wide, capable of holding five thousand ballots. Regarding the issues of voting dates and ballot box capacity limitations, we propose that the size of each district, that is, the number of voters under each polling station, should be standardized at five thousand people. It can be agreed that in urban areas, two or three bao form a district; in large townships, one township forms a district; and in small townships, two townships form a district, with one polling station set up in each district. (3) Regarding vote counting, general estimates are that National Assembly legislators and committee members with more votes may receive one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand or more votes. Such large numbers are difficult to calculate. Universal suffrage counting uses the "正" character [a tally mark system], but this number is too large, and the "正" character is not easy to use. Therefore, it is proposed that the names of the candidates be pre-labeled on each ballot box, and then the ballots be counted in bundles of one thousand to simplify the process.

### Authorities Have Not Decided on Reconstruction of the National Assembly Hall

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the reconstruction of the National Assembly Hall, personnel from both the Executive Yuan and internal departments are currently in discussion. It is reported that the current standard is to accommodate three thousand seats. According to Hong Lanyou, told reporters, the quota of three thousand representatives should prepare 4,500 seats, because the imperial hearing by the guests, the seats of the general meeting staff and journalists must be considered.

### Central Political Committee Discusses the Current Situation, Various Members Offer Major Policy Suggestions, Recommend Sun and Chen to Submit to the President for Approval

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The current situation is approaching a critical stage, and people from all walks of life are paying close attention. In the Central Political Committee meeting held on the morning of the 18th, a heated discussion was held, and the members agreed that major policy decisions were necessary. Opinions were offered one after another. As a result, Sun and Chen Lifu were recommended to submit these opinions to the President immediately, and another extraordinary meeting will be convened in the near future to specifically discuss this issue. There were many speakers during the discussion on the 18th, even Niu Yongjian, who is usually very prudent, stood up and spoke, saying: The overall situation is extremely serious, and a decision should be made immediately. The general view of the other committee members who spoke was that the Communist Party has rejected peace talks and is hostile to the current National Government. Judging from various signs in the war, it is indeed involved in international background. The Central Government must consider all the circumstances before making a major decision because the situation is serious and cannot be delayed any longer. Military and diplomatic measures should be taken simultaneously, and it is not appropriate to remain passive, so that both domestic and foreign countries can have a clearer understanding of the current situation. In reality, the situation in Northeast and Northwest China shows that the Communist army's operations have the appearance of an international war. Our country should make a decision for the sake of the nation, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, but the world, especially the United States, should face the reality. President Truman's policy should not differentiate between Europe and the Far East. The discussion on the 18th lasted a very long time. In the end, because the President did not attend and no conclusion could be reached, Sun and Chen were recommended to submit the matter to the President for approval, and then an extraordinary meeting will be convened for discussion. Some of the committee members who attended believed that the meeting on the 18th was very fruitful and meaningful, demonstrating their concern for national affairs.

Universal Suffrage Party Nomination Methods Decided to Submit to the State Council for Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Central Political Committee held a routine meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th, chaired by Sun Ke. First, Foreign Minister Wang reported on the handling of the Xinjiang incident and the diplomatic negotiations, and also discussed the war situation. Then, Ma Chaojun, Minister of Agriculture and Industry, who had recently returned to Nanjing from the Northeast, reported on his observations in the Northeast. Then, the current situation was discussed, and several proposals were passed and personnel appointments were finalized. The main points are listed below: (1) Methods for party nomination in elections. (2) The number of legislators for industrial and professional groups is expected to be submitted to the State Council for consideration, requesting an increase to 110, because the 56 approved by the Legislative Yuan are insufficient for distribution among the occupational groups. (3) The Education Professional Committee proposed preliminary principles for reforming secondary education. Regarding personnel changes, (1) the candidates for mayor of the four special municipalities of Hankou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Shenyang were finalized. Except for Wang Youzhi, who is proposed to be transferred from the mayor of Xi'an to the director of the Department of Education of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, the mayors of the other three cities are not expected to change. (2) It was decided that Wu Tiecheng would succeed as the vice president of the Legislative Yuan. (3) It was decided that Yuan Da would be appointed as the ambassador to Greece. (4) It was decided that Xu Jizhuang would be appointed as a legislator. (5) It was decided that Xing Jihui would be appointed as a supervisor. The above personnel changes are subject to review and discussion by the State Council before a decision is made.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the methods for party nomination in the universal suffrage, the Central Political Committee discussed this on the 18th and decided to submit it to the State Council. The proposed method is to limit it to the three parties participating in the government. Parties other than the three parties, if they participate in the election, will follow the general provisions of the election law. As for how to recognize political parties after the implementation of the constitution, the executive branch will refer to national examples to determine.

### Regulations of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Agreed Upon, Plenary Session of the Committee to Be Held Today, Next General Assembly Scheduled for July 10th in New York

[Our Dispatch] The first General Assembly of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East was held for the third day yesterday. The fifth meeting was held at 10:30 a.m., and the sixth meeting was held at 2:30 p.m., both chaired by Dr. Jiang Tingfu. After passing the provisional agenda, it was decided that the Plenary Committee of the conference will be held at Lake Success in New York on July 10th. It was also decided that the Plenary Subcommittee will begin today to specifically discuss Section 2 of Part 2 of the United Nations Economic and Social Council resolution of March 28th, which states: "The meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East shall be responsible for collecting more information on economic recovery and investigating it. If necessary, it shall also conduct on-site inspections, and then provide a report on the results of the investigation to the next General Assembly of the Council."

When representatives from various countries discussed the above issues, it caused a heated debate, especially the Soviet representative Shidexin Ke spoke a lot.

The formal work of the General Assembly has only just begun today. The discussions in the past three days have all been about formalities and regulations. Now that the regulations have been agreed upon yesterday, it can officially begin its heavy tasks today.

The details of yesterday's meeting are recorded in detail below:

### Discussing the Provisional Agenda, A Heated Debate, Morning Meeting Fails to Reach a Result

Chairman Jiang Yanfu raised the fifth item on the agenda, "Discussing the Provisional Agenda," when the meeting opened yesterday morning. Indian representative Nehru immediately suggested that the following three points should be included in this item: (1) Membership and organization of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, (2) Changes or additions to the regional scope, and (3) The temporary headquarters of the committee (the above three points have been stipulated by the United Nations Economic and Social Council to be discussed by the Plenary Committee at its meeting in New York).

Nehru's suggestion aroused different opinions in the General Assembly, which differed for a long time. After Mr. Nai stated his views, Mr. Wo Wen replied that the issue of the headquarters could be discussed in three situations: (1) The headquarters of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East will be the headquarters of the United Nations Far East Office, which must be decided by the United Nations General Assembly. (2) Before 1948, the temporary headquarters could be decided by this conference (referring to the meeting of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East); (3) Before a decision is made, the temporary headquarters of the Secretariat of this conference will be in Shanghai.

Soviet representative Shidexin Ke agreed with Mr. Nai's suggestion that three items should be added to the temporary agenda: (1) Membership, (2) Regional scope, and (3) The duties of this conference.

Australian representative Wu Dengfa asked: If an issue has been decided to be discussed by the Plenary Committee, can this conference also discuss it?

British representative Crowe said: This conference was produced by the Economic and Social Council, so it should be restricted by the resolutions of the council.

Shidexin Ke also asked: If the Plenary Committee held in New York was produced by this conference, why should its affairs be reported directly to the Economic and Social Council?

American representative Pei Davis said: This delegation is not prepared to discuss the issues raised by the Soviet representative. He believes that if it must be discussed, it will violate the instructions of the organizational body of this conference, so he proposed to pass the original temporary agenda.

Shi expressed his disagreement, citing the documents he received and reciting one point in it: "The Economic and Social Council requests this conference to discuss this issue."

Chinese representative Li Gan, in order to ease the atmosphere between the two sides, said: The point that this conference was produced by the Economic and Social Council need not be repeated, so this conference does not seem to exceed the scope of the agenda currently set by the general agency. He also endorsed the opinions of both parties, suggesting that the original agenda be adopted, but the opinions of the Indian and Soviet representatives can also be expressed during the agenda, so as to provide a reference for the future Plenary Committee in New York.

Indian representative Nehru then agreed to pass the agenda, but did not advocate discussing item 6: the establishment of the Plenary Committee.

Davis explained that his suggestion did not mean that other representatives could not express their opinions, but the US delegation was not prepared to discuss the three issues raised by the Soviet representative, because the agenda did not stipulate that there should be decisive measures or resolutions on this issue.

At this point, the chairman said: The Indian representative wants to amend the agenda and cancel the sixth item: "Establishing a Plenary Committee." I suggest that the Indian representative may propose to change the nature or organization of the Plenary Committee when discussing the sixth item, and at the same time, he can propose specific instructions. As far as I know, although this conference is restricted by the resolutions of the Economic and Social Council, the resolution cannot prevent us from giving instructions to the subordinate institutions of this conference.

French representative Moore No said; There seems to be some misunderstanding in the opinions of the representatives, and we should not have any misunderstandings, so he advocated adjourning the meeting and waiting for further discussion in the afternoon.

The chairman put the adjournment to a vote. The four representatives of India, the Soviet Union, and France supported it, while the three representatives of Liberia, the United States, and the Philippines opposed it. They were asked to adjourn the meeting under the principle of "minority obeying the majority." The meeting was originally scheduled to be held at 3:00 p.m. British representative Crowe suggested that the case should be concluded as soon as possible, and suggested holding it at 2:30 p.m., which was passed.

Suggestions from Indian and Soviet Representatives The vote was not passed Siam's representatives voted twice in abstention

The agenda issue continued to be discussed in the afternoon, and Stretenski formally proposed to add the three points he proposed to the agenda. Neru seconded. After being put to a vote, only two representatives from India and the Soviet Union voted in favor, and eight representatives from China, Britain, the United States, Australia, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and Siam voted against, which was not passed. The Indian representative's proposal to cancel the "Establishment of a Plenary Committee" was voted again, and the result was also rejected by two votes (India and the Soviet Union) to seven (the representative of Siam abstained). British representative Crowe immediately proposed to pass the "Establishment of a Plenary Committee," and Philippine representative Vice Chairman Guaxian asked to second the motion, which was passed by seven votes to two (India and the Soviet Union) (the Siam representative abstained again).

When the Chairman continued to put the seventh item of the agenda to discuss the resolution of the Economic and Social Council, Shteltsenkov asked: If one or several representatives abandon their participation in the plenary committee, will the plenary committee still have its full power? The principal responded by saying: This is a matter of organizational law and legal matters, and I am not in a position to answer. He then asked Wo Wen to explain, and Wo Wen said: The agenda of the plenary committee should be restricted by the rules of procedure of this meeting. All meetings should be open unless this meeting decides not to open them.

Then, the date of the Plenary Committee meeting in Success Lake, New York was discussed. The date was originally scheduled to be held on July 7 this year. Later, the Indian representative proposed that it would be too late to go to New York to participate after this meeting ended, so he advocated a delay of a few days. Later, Wo Wen proposed on July 10th, and the British representative first agreed to set it on the 7th, and then also agreed on the 10th, so it was decided to be held on July 10th.

Establishment of a Plenary Subcommittee

A proposal from an American representative was passed

Then, American representative Davis proposed to form the committee (that is, Asia Feng Economic Association) into a plenary subcommittee in order to discuss the various issues included in the seventh item. This proposal was endorsed by the Philippine representative.

Stretenski immediately stated: He could not understand the scope of discussion and enforcement mechanisms of the plenary subcommittee. The chairman immediately replied: If the US representative's proposal can be passed, then the committee will be able to start discussing the issues raised by the Soviet representative. Wo Wen also said: All measures of this meeting, and the manner of enforcement, must be decided by this committee itself.

Some representatives could not understand the difference between the Plenary Committee held in New York and the Plenary Committee held in Shanghai, and asked questions for a while. Wo Wen suggested: In order to facilitate the distinction between the two Plenary Committees, the Committee in New York should be called the "First Plenary Committee," and the Plenary Committee in Shanghai should be called the "Second Plenary Committee."

The Chairman then put the US representative's proposal to a vote, which was immediately passed unanimously, and the conference adjourned at 4:00 p.m.

### The difference between the two Plenary Committees

The so-called "First Plenary Committee" is scheduled to be held at Success Lake on July 10th to discuss the membership, regional scope, and changes or increases in the scope of iron affairs of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The results of the meeting should be reported to the Economic and Social Council. The delegation of the committee is still the ten countries that are now attending the meeting, and representatives can be appointed by each country separately. The candidates for chairman will be elected at the time of the meeting.

As for the Second Plenary Committee, that is, the Plenary Subcommittee, it will be held at 10:30 a.m. this morning to study and discuss Section 2 of Part 2 of the Economic and Social Council's resolution (the content has been explained above). Its representatives are still the full representatives of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The main purpose is that the subcommittee can freely express their opinions, and the discussion of issues is also broader. However, after the various issues to be discussed in item 7 of the agenda are concluded, the plenary subcommittee will be restored to the original committee meeting.

### Representatives of Ten Countries to Visit Beijing Next Week to Pay Respects to Chairman Jiang, the General Assembly to Adjourn for One Day on the 24th

### Implementation of the Japanese Provisional Compensation Plan, Allied Headquarters Has Drafted a List, the United States Will Propose a New Plan, China Has Not Received Notification

[United Press, Tokyo, 18th] According to top sources: The work of the Allied Headquarters on the 30% provisional compensation plan is ready, and it is waiting for the order of the Washington Far East Commission. After careful study, the Allied Headquarters has drafted a "list of suitable materials" for the 30% provisional compensation, which is sufficient to ensure that countries that have not participated in the initial compensation plan will not be affected in the end. Headquarters officials are eager to implement the compensation plan, as it is closely related to the recovery of Japan's foreign trade. Unless the compensation issue is resolved at least in part, recent efforts to restore Japan's foreign trade will be virtually futile.

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 18th] According to reports, the United States will propose a new Japanese compensation plan, which will greatly ease restrictions on Japan's future industry. The reporter inquired about this to the person in charge of the Compensation Committee, and was told: To date, we have not received any official documents regarding this news. According to reliable sources: If this case is really proposed, we will definitely argue based on reason.

### Statement by the Reparations Committee: Quantities of Japanese Reparation Goods

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Chinese five-member Reparations Committee, in its detailed report released today, estimated that the total amount of reparation goods under the interim reparations plan (including packed weight) is approximately five million tons. The publication of this report aims to clarify the misunderstanding among the Chinese people regarding the total tonnage of reparations goods under the interim reparations plan. The report released today by the Chinese five-member Reparations Committee quoted a statement issued on May 6th by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry's Reparations Implementation Committee: "The total amount of reparation goods is approximately 5.2 million tons, with freight estimated at 12,000 Japanese yen per ton." According to the most recent reparations figures drafted by the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the following are the details (there are thirteen types of industries): (1) Arsenal equipment: net weight 1,229,769 tons, gross weight 1,660,189 tons; (2) Aircraft manufacturing plants: net weight 266,218 tons, gross weight 512,704 tons; (3) Privately owned munitions factories: net weight 200,704 tons, gross weight 280,997 tons; (4) Machine tool factories: net weight 66,623 tons, gross weight 93,273 tons; (5) Ball bearing factories: net weight 21,667 tons, gross weight 30,278 tons; (6) Power plants: net weight 178,740 tons, gross weight 254,592 tons; (7) Steel factories: net weight 900,298 tons, gross weight 1,125,371 tons; (8) Caustic soda factories: net weight 43,062 tons, gross weight 53,820 tons; (9) Sodium carbonate factories: net weight 15,700 tons, gross weight 19,625 tons; (10) Sulfuric acid factories: net weight 41,394 tons, gross weight 51,755 tons; (11) Synthetic rubber factories: net weight 4,471 tons, gross weight 5,365 tons; (12) Privately owned shipyards: net weight 174,506 tons, gross weight 218,132 tons; (13) Laboratories: net weight 1,625 tons.

### Nanchang-Xunyang Railway Line Trial Run Yesterday, Operations to Begin Next Month

[Our Correspondent in Nanchang, 18th] The Nanchang-Xunyang line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway underwent a trial run on the 18th. Due to the completion of the track restoration work amidst various difficulties and the rudimentary nature of the facilities, there are currently no passenger cars on the line. Passengers stand in enemy trucks, swaying as they travel. The Xiang-produced railway sleepers are not of sufficient dimensions, and although more are being added, they are still inadequate for the load. The sleepers creaked loudly during the trial run, and the train did not dare to travel quickly when crossing bridges, resulting in a very slow speed of only about ten kilometers per hour. The line is scheduled to begin operations on July 1st, with a formal opening ceremony to be held on July 7th. According to the Engineering Department, the track laying progress reached 5.48 on June 15th, setting a new post-war railway restoration record.

### Local Dispatches

Hangzhou

The thorough repair of the Qiantang River Bridge has been delayed due to the slow arrival of funding. The Engineering Office, for safety reasons, has mainly conducted inspections. The bridge's foundations are quite good, so the vibrations are not severe, and traffic can still be maintained.

Jiaxing

Zhou, the deputy commander of the Xinshi Township militia, has been dismissed by County Magistrate Hu through the Military Affairs Section for poor discipline. The security police team stationed in Xinshi should be withdrawn to the district, and the guard platoon is not allowed to be stationed in schools. The Military Affairs Section has issued orders accordingly.

Jiangyin

The first general meeting of the County Assembly was held on the 15th. On the 10th, a county administration report was taken, and the questioning regarding the warehouse theft case in the First District was intense. After County Magistrate Xu received a telegram from the Assembly, he instructed Xu Bo to pursue the warehouse director, Liu Xin, who had not returned from leave. The acting warehouse manager, Bu Heng, and seven others were detained, and Wu Liang, the deputy director of the Grain Administration, was also placed under surveillance, pending a thorough investigation by the province.

Pinghu

Dai Xian, an employee of the Shanghai Wuzhou Pharmacy, recently came to Pinghu under the assumed name Zhang Leshou. He is staying at the Fu'an Hotel, loitering in the city, and pursuing young girls.

### Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Submit Memorandum Requesting Inclusion of Anti-Chinese Issues on Agenda

[Central News Agency, Manila, 18th] Chinese merchants here have recently submitted a memorandum to the United Nations Far East Economic Commission in Shanghai, requesting that the anti-Chinese trends in the Philippines and market issues over the years be included on the agenda. They believe that the Far East Economic Commission should take appropriate measures to persuade Philippine leaders to curb the general anti-Chinese trends and, in particular, repeal the Public Market Stall Act. The memorandum lists various legislative proposals and administrative measures by the Philippine government that are clearly directed against foreign nationals (in reality, mainly anti-Chinese), the most hateful of which is Bill No. 37, the basic purpose of which is to eliminate the vested legal occupations of overseas Chinese. The memorandum also states that an anti-Chinese alliance has been organized in the Philippines, led by Sator, whose purpose is to expel all overseas Chinese from the Philippines.

[Another dispatch] Anti-Chinese sentiment in the Philippines has taken a new turn. More than 1,000 overseas Chinese on Samar Island have recently received warning letters signed by Mangochai, ordering them to cease all business operations. Mangochai claims to be the leader of an anti-Chinese retired veterans organization. Overseas Chinese here have urgently sent representatives to the Chinese Consulate in the Philippines to report the activities of this new organization and express their deep concern that if this anti-Chinese trend is not stopped in time, it will lead to adverse consequences.

Editorial

### Facing the Essence of "Internal Disorder"

Amid the calls for peace from the people of the whole country, we have seen the Chinese Communists' rejection of the peace appeals made by the Political Consultative Conference, dismissing the Conference as a "tool of the government" and denying its representation of popular will in its peace appeals. This newspaper has previously commented that peace is a unanimous appeal of the people, and also the consistent policy of the government. The reason why peace has not been achieved lies in the attitude of the Communist Party. We cited a dispatch from Nanjing by a United Press reporter: "The ultimate goal of the Chinese Communists is one-party dictatorship, rather than multi-party participation in government, which is the same as the Soviet political system in various parts of the world. Under these circumstances, achieving peace will not be easy." Now, the war is unfolding fiercely in various parts of the country: in the Northeast, in southern Shandong, in Tianjin-Qinhuangdao, in various parts of North China, and even as far as Gansu in the Northwest and Guangdong and Fujian in the Southeast, the Chinese Communists are engaging in destructive activities against unity, revival, and construction. Under these circumstances, the National Army cannot sit idly by and await death, but must resist. Therefore, nearly two years after the victorious end of the war against Japan, there is still a state of war in various parts of the country. To this day, the government is still seeking peace, while the Chinese Communists are expanding their power by force, step by step, without ceasing. Is this not a mockery of calls for peace? Don't look at other things. US troops were originally stationed in Tianjin-Qinhuangdao. Recently, after the US troops withdrew in batches, the Chinese Communists used force to coerce them, so that the road traffic between Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Beiping is on the verge of being cut off, and the disaster of war is about to return. Who created this situation? Is it not clearly created by the Chinese Communists? The people of the whole country are concerned about the situation in the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao area. They understand that the current situation in the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao area is entirely due to the Chinese Communists' attempt to take advantage of the US troop withdrawal to gain a favorable position, which the National Army has to counter. From this example, we can see that the reason why the domestic war is ongoing is precisely because the Chinese Communists believe in force.

What we want to point out here is that this is by no means a situation of "civil war." The "Civil War" that occurred in the United States during the time of President Lincoln was not like this; even the Spanish "Civil War" during the time of Franco was different. To say that this is a "civil war" is to insult the people of the whole country, because peace is the hope of the people of the whole country, and the government has never abandoned the desire for peace. The people and the government do not want war, and the reason why war has not been avoided is that the Chinese Communists believe in force, trying to subvert the current government and complete their ambition to seize power. This constitutes "internal disorder," which the government should order to suppress in order to uphold law and order. However, even saying it is "internal disorder" is problematic. The "disorder" occurring in the country today is no longer purely "internal disorder," but is actually a collusion between internal and external forces, with an international character. Today, there are officers and soldiers who once belonged to the Japanese "Imperial Army" in the armed forces of the Chinese Communists, and in the Northeast, there are armed forces of the North Korean people fighting alongside the Chinese Communist forces. Is this not clearly an international war? And at this time, the Soviet-Mongolian troops invaded Xinjiang in our country, echoing the Communist military actions in the Northeast, North China, and other places, which is obviously a planned act of rebellion, mobilizing international forces and violating the wishes of the people of the whole country for peace? Therefore, we must clarify the essence of the "internal disorder" occurring in China. This is a recognition that the people of the whole country must have.

Since the Chinese Communists have colluded with foreign forces and openly rebelled, what is the difference between their actions and those of the traitors like Wang Jingwei? The people of the whole country can distinguish right from wrong, and they have their own opinions on the actions of those who betray national interests; we do not need to point out more here. However, there are a few points that we cannot but point out here:

First, what the Communist Party is doing in China violates the will of the people of the whole country and is abandoned by the people of the whole country. It has also mobilized international forces, giving the turmoil in China a strong international color. We firmly believe that our government will be able to handle this situation well. We regret that when the domestic situation has not yet stabilized and order has not been restored, the US troops stationed in China have already withdrawn, while the Soviet Union still has heavy troops stationed in our Northeast. Now that the war against Japan has ended, we hope that the Soviet Union's troops stationed in our Northeast can also withdraw quickly.

Second, since the turbulent situation in China has an international meaning, our neighboring countries can no longer take a bystander's attitude, as if they were not involved; they should actively and more clearly express their attitude. Although the situation in Europe is worrying, the situation in Asia is even more worrying. We should not forget that the Second World War did not occur in Munich, but in Shenyang, China. The Truman Doctrine and Marshall's statement should include Asia, and should focus on Asia. The development of the situation in China to the present stage is occupying an important factor in international relations, and we should not ignore this point.

Third, we had the slogan of fighting the war and building the country during the war. Now that the war of resistance has ended victoriously, although there is the rebellion of the Communist Party, we should actively launch our work of reviving and building the country. Seeking construction in destruction, seeking stability in turmoil, this is our slogan during the war, and it is also our slogan now. Therefore, we hope that the government can take into account construction while facing the war. After a long period of war, the national economy of our country has been riddled with holes. Even if it is not possible to completely cure the root cause at this time, we should also urgently seek treatment, hoping to gradually recover. When the economic situation improves slightly, the mood of the people will also inevitably increase. Military, political, and economic, these three are inseparable. The rebellion of the Communist Party is comprehensive, and we must also use comprehensive operations to deal with them.

### Continuous Rain for Over a Month in Taiwan, Rice Spikes Damaged, Bridges and Embankments Washed Away, Sun Moon Lake Power Transmission to Northern Taiwan Temporarily Suspended

[Our Correspondent in Taipei, 17th] Taiwan Province has experienced incessant heavy rain for over a month. The rice spikes in the south have suffered significant damage. It is reported that some of the rice grains in Kaohsiung have begun to germinate. Sugarcane, a major product of Tainan and Chiayi, has also begun to rot. In the north, the rice planting season is delayed. According to the Hsinchu County Government after inspecting more than 40 townships, the impact is still minimal. However, if the rain continues, the future of the food supply is also quite concerning. Excessive water accumulation in the mountains has caused dramatic downstream flow, resulting in the collapse of iron towers near Miaoli. Power transmission from Sun Moon Lake to northern Taiwan has been temporarily suspended, and thermal power generation is being used as a substitute. The Dazhuoshui Bridge in the east has also suffered damage, and parts of the highway there have also been damaged. Although repairs have been completed, passengers still need to walk across the bridge and change vehicles at Dazhuoshui Bridge. Regarding embankments, according to urgent repair reports received by the Public Works Bureau, there are more than 20 embankment failures in Hsinchu, Houlong River, Tainan, Beiwei, Taitung, Beinan, Daxi, and Taichung County. The damage in Wufeng is the most severe, with repair costs estimated at 26 million yuan. Regarding railways, the railway bridge near Changhua North and Zhuifen has been damaged, and night trains have been suspended. The Provincial Government has specifically formulated key points for flood season rescue and embankment engineering, and has telegraphed various counties and cities to take strict precautions.

On the 17th, the price of rice in Chengdu was 170,000 yuan per picul.

Yin's Defense of Treasonous Acts Reveals Further Deceit

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 18th] After the case of the old-time traitor Yin Rugeng was remanded for retrial, the Beijing High Court reopened for a second trial at 10:30 AM on the 18th, presided over by Presiding Judge Lu Yunxie.

### Britain and France Reach Agreement to Establish European Economic Commission, to Invite Soviet Union to Participate in Work, to Implement Tasks within United Nations Framework

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 18th Broadcast: Britain and France agreed today to establish a European Economic Commission within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission, in order to implement the Marshall Plan for economic assistance to Europe. A French government spokesman claimed that Britain and France will jointly invite the Soviet Union to participate in the work of the Commission. According to the current British-French agreement, it was facilitated by Bidault and Bevin, and the French cabinet immediately approved it. According to French sources, the establishment of this European Commission is based on the French plan, stipulating that reconstruction work be handled by specialized committees, but all work will be carried out within the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission. The United Nations Economic Commission is actually a design institution, while the new commission is an executive institution.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 18th] French Foreign Minister Bidault and British Foreign Secretary Bevin held their second meeting this morning. After the Anglo-French talks ended, Bidault will go to London to approve the Anglo-French Treaty and continue discussions on the US economic plan.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] French Prime Minister Ramadier, Foreign Minister Bidault, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and economic advisors from both sides engaged in initial contact at a banquet at the British Embassy tonight to determine concrete steps for Europe to respond to the Marshall Plan. After Bevin and his experts arrived at the British Embassy, ​​they joined their embassy colleagues to study a memorandum provided by Alphonse, Director of the Economic Division of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The content of the document is the same as announced by Alphonse last night. The main points are to suggest the establishment of four committees to study Europe's needs and capabilities in coal, steel, transportation and agriculture. Bevin and Ramadier's difficulties tonight were whether to start consultations immediately on a smaller scale, or to avoid exclusive negotiations for political reasons to prevent being regarded by others as a "Western economic bloc". Moscow has criticized the Marshall Plan as transplanting the disguised Truman anti-communism in the economic aspect. Before Moscow expresses its formal opinion, the Anglo-French talks cannot but be extra cautious. In the Paris talks today and tomorrow, British and French representatives should reach a resolution on all or part of the following questions: (1) Will the pan-European economic design under the Marshall Plan start from a restrictive Western European foundation to develop eastward, or will it wait for most European countries to express their agreement before holding a meeting to discuss the reconstruction policy? (2) If it is decided to adopt the latter approach mentioned above, how will the meeting be convened and who will draft the agenda? (3) If the Soviet Union refuses to participate in the common European economic design under the Marshall Plan, will Britain and France continue to launch a common design in the rest of Europe? If so, will Eastern European countries within the Soviet sphere of influence participate? (4) How can the economic design under the Marshall Plan cooperate with the economic design of Germany, and who will represent Germany to participate in the design institution? Some British and American officials feel that although this matter is expected to progress rapidly, observers can only take instructions at any time and cannot immediately expect its results. However, observers believe that Bevin and Ramadier should at least decide that the discussion of a common European economic design will be based on the entirety of Europe west of Asia, or will start with Western Europe first, but keep the door open for the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to participate later.

### Bevin Instructs Peterson to Ask if the Soviet Union Accepts US Aid Plan, Soviet Union Denies Molotov's Visit to France

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin flew to Paris by plane today. A few hours before his departure, he re-instructed British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Peterson to ask Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov whether the Soviet government intends to accept the United States' proposed plan to provide economic assistance to Europe. Although Pravda published an article opposing the European economic recovery plan proposed by US Secretary of State Marshall, and it is said that this plan has caused a bad impression among Soviet officials, the British government does not admit that this is a definite rejection of the US proposal by the Soviet government. In addition, Foreign Secretary Bevin also instructed Ambassador Peterson to ask the Soviet government to explain the dismissal of former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy. It is reported that the British government previously requested the Soviet Union to provide information on this matter, which was rejected by the Soviet government.

[Agence France-Presse, Insco, 17th] There have been rumors that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Paris. Diplomatic circles here expressed surprise upon hearing the news, saying that Pravda has already commented on Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid European economic recovery, expressing absolute disapproval. Therefore, it is impossible for the Soviet Union to send Foreign Minister Molotov to Paris to discuss this plan.

### French President Praises Marshall Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] French President Auriol recently gave a speech at a banquet held by the Foreign Press Association today, praising Secretary of State Marshall's European recovery plan. He briefly stated: There is no time for hesitation at the moment. The French government welcomes Secretary of State Marshall's bold and wise plan, which is a ray of dawn on the road of life. We need to move forward bravely immediately, without any further delay. France expresses its agreement with international economic and political cooperation. This is not the time for hesitation, suspicion, or argument. Our ancient continent should not miss this opportunity.

### Another Soviet Hint Regarding US Aid to Europe Plan

Advocating Management by UN Agencies

[Reuters, London, 18th] A Moscow broadcast last night stated that the Soviet Union will not encourage any new attempts to assess Europe's economic needs. The broadcast, reiterating the Pravda's criticism of the Marshall Plan for European Aid the day before, also stated that the plan is an interference in the economic affairs of other countries. It believes that the current task is not to collect information on the economic needs of various countries, but to address these needs under the principles of international cooperation in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. This Moscow broadcast hints that the Soviet Union may be more willing to accept the Marshall Plan for European Aid if it can be implemented through the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe instead of establishing separate agencies. This hint may have some impact on Bevin's negotiations in Paris.

### World Bank Resolves to Assist Countries with Construction

[United States New Opening Office, Washington, 17th] Mr. Binio, Director of the Lending Department of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, told the Columbia Business Promotion Association today that the prosperity of the United States depends on the soundness of the world economy. The soundness of the world economy can be guided by the International Bank formulating plans, enhancing mutual assistance among member states, and engaging in domestic construction and development, thereby guiding it. Mr. Bi continued: The total amount of loans currently held by the bank has reached 2.554 billion US dollars. The bank will decide on applications for loans based on the following facts: whether the loan is urgent and useful; whether the loan is beneficial to the borrower and world trade; whether the borrower is willing and able to utilize its own resources to the greatest extent; whether the loan can meet the borrower's ; whether the borrower has the ability to maintain the terms of the loan, etc. Loans can only be granted after member states submit implementation plans and have appropriate guarantees.

### US-Soviet Negotiations on Clearing Lend-Lease Debt Stalled

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Regarding the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on clearing lend-lease debts, diplomatic sources here said that the negotiations have been stalled due to difficulties encountered by the Soviet Union in drawing up a list of lend-lease materials. The Soviet Union cannot provide the US authorities with a detailed list of equipment provided by the United States during the war.

### Italian President's Resignation Withdrawn; Italy Expresses Willingness to Support Marshall Plan

[Report from this newspaper] London, 18th Radio: Nicola, the interim president of the Italian Republic, expressed his intention to resign yesterday, citing physical exhaustion, but has decided to withdraw his resignation due to the earnest retention of Prime Minister Gasperi.

[Reuters, Rome, 17th] President Nicola's announcement today of his firm decision to resign has greatly stirred up the Italian political situation. It is understood that all parties are making efforts to retain Mr. Nicola, because there is currently no legal or parliamentary mechanism for appointing an interim president. President Nicola is 69 years old and is believed to be suffering from nervous fatigue and in urgent need of rest. He had previously announced his resignation on June 24, the original date for the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly. Recently, the Constituent Assembly has been extended to November 31, and the general election has also been changed to the New Year next year. Nicola was elected president by an overwhelming majority by the Constituent Assembly on June 28, 1946. It is reported that Gasperi Delley has told President Nicola that if he is in poor health, he can take a long vacation, but in any case, he should be asked to continue serving until the end of the Constituent Assembly. As for the left-wing parties, they are deeply gratified by President Nicola's firm intention to resign. They believe that Mr. Nicola's resignation may not be due to personal health reasons, but to a lack of trust in the current government.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Italian Ambassador Tagliani formally informed US Undersecretary of State Clayton today that Italy will fully support Secretary of State Marshall's announced aid to Europe plan. Tae also told reporters, "Italy will do its best to cooperate with other European countries and respond to the Marshall Plan. I have informed Clayton of this intention."

Italian Communist Party Turns Course

[United Press, Rome, 17th] Former Italian Communist Party Finance Minister Scimarolo and several economic experts from the party gave speeches to the Italian Parliament last night, officially stating that Italy's finances depend on the United States, and that Italy is in urgent need of foreign loans, which only the United States can provide. The Italian Communist Party's current attitude of supporting borrowing from the United States can be regarded as an action to break away from the international communist line, but Scimarolo's speech also shows that there are sharp differences between the Italian Communist Party and the Kremlin's policies. For example, the Italian Communist Party fully supports the incorporation of Trieste into Italy, while the Kremlin advocates ceding it to Yugoslavia in international conferences.

### Hungarian Bank Shares Partially Transferred to Soviet Union

[Reuters, Hungarian Capital, 17th] It is learned that the Soviet Union has reached an agreement with the Hungarian authorities stipulating that the shares in the Hungarian Loan Bank that are considered German foreign capital and should belong to the Soviet Union according to the Potsdam Agreement will be transferred to the Soviet Union. Most of the bank's shares were owned by the French Rothschild family before the war, but were acquired by Germany after France's defeat. According to the Soviet-Hungarian agreement, 35% of the shares will belong to the Soviet Union, and the remainder will continue to be held by private shareholders until the issue of private ownership of the bank is resolved. At the same time, negotiations between the Hungarian Minister of Finance and the Minister of Trade in Moscow on financial and commercial relations between the two countries seem to have reached a deadlock. The Hungarian Minister of Finance is scheduled to return home next week for instructions, and will return to Moscow after completing his official duties.

### Former Prime Minister Nagy Expresses Intention to Form Hungarian Government in Exile; Hopes US Will Take Further Action to Prevent Deterioration of European Situation

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy told the American press here today that if Britain and the United States can recognize the Hungarian government in exile, he can prepare to organize such a government, but he said that this government may not be located in the United States. Mr. Na also said, I have a plan to resolve the entire Hungarian situation, but I do not intend to discuss it until I have contacted State Department officials. I intend to be the spokesperson for my unfortunate people, so that the world can know the truth about Hungary and other European countries. Mr. Na also denounced the Soviet General Svelidov, chairman of the Allied Control Commission in the Hungarian capital, for saying that the new Hungarian government had obtained the consent of the people as nonsense, and recognized the Soviet Union's rejection of the American protest as another milestone on the Soviet road to defeat. He also believes that to prevent the European situation from further deteriorating, action is needed that is even greater than resistance to the machine. When asked what kind of action he hoped Britain and the United States would take, he said that he did not intend to comment on this point until he had consulted with the State Department. Mr. Na will visit various dignitaries tomorrow and meet with Marshall at the State Department. It is hoped that he will be received by President Truman this week.

Hungarian People Lose Freedom

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy said to the press here today: Soviet police will use the most inhumane methods to extract confessions from the members of the Smallholders Party elected by the Hungarian people according to law. The Hungarian people have lost their independence due to the conspiracy of the Soviet Union and the Communists. They are no longer responsible for the words and deeds of the current leaders. I protest this aggression and sincerely hope that the world's comments and the governments of all free countries will take appropriate steps to restore the freedom of the Hungarian people and all oppressed people in Europe.

[Associated Press, Hungarian Capital, 17th] Suriok, leader of the Hungarian Free Party, declared today: The Communist Party's disruption of the Free Party meeting in Gette yesterday proves that Hungary is a police state. I have cancelled all scheduled political speeches because I do not want to cause the danger of conflict again, unless the freedom of assembly of our party is guaranteed. At the same time, Communist Party members said that Free Party members feel that such riots may start a civil war.

### Anglo-Egyptian Treaty Revision Dispute; Egypt Appeals to Security Council; Prime Minister to Lead Delegation to New York in Person

[Reuters, Cairo, 17th] Egyptian Minister of Commerce Heyas declared today that the Egyptian government has formally appealed to the Security Council today, requesting the United Nations mechanism to review the Anglo-Egyptian dispute over the 1936 treaty. Egyptian Prime Minister Nocrassi will personally lead a delegation to attend the Security Council and is expected to depart for New York before the end of the month. The Egyptian government's application was submitted by the Egyptian Embassy in the United States. When the Anglo-Egyptian treaty negotiations broke down in January this year, the Egyptian Prime Minister announced that the purpose of appealing to the Security Council was to demand the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and the merger of Sudan and Egypt.

[Reuters, London, 17th] A foreign spokesperson said tonight that Sir Gadgan, the British representative to the Security Council, has been fully informed of Britain's position in the Anglo-Egyptian dispute. Britain continues to consider this position to be reasonable. Therefore, if Egypt claims that the 1936 treaty has lost its effect due to the failure of the treaty revision negotiations, Britain will correct it. The British government feels that the United Nations mechanism should give appropriate consideration to the following facts: The breakdown of the treaty revision negotiations was due to Britain's sense of responsibility to protect the rights of the Sudanese people, not because of Egypt's demand for the complete withdrawal of British troops. Regarding the latter point, London has already agreed.

### On the Arrest of Betkov, the Bulgarian Prime Minister's Statement

Determined to Fulfill Treaty Obligations

[Reuters, Sofia, 17th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, in response to the United States' accusation of the Bulgarian government's arrest of opposition leader Betkov, made a statement today, asking foreign bystanders to be patient and not to make noise before Betkov, who is accused of plotting a violent coup, is tried. Mr. Di said that he had explained to the United States the legal reasons for Bet's arrest, and said that if thousands of short-sighted people thought that after Bet's arrest, there would be unrest and riots against the Fatherland Front, such phenomena did not occur. The whole country is peaceful now, because for several months, thoughtful Bulgarians have been aware of Betkov's and his party's actions that are detrimental to the people. Therefore, no one protested against Betkov's arrest. So far, the government has only received two letters defending Betkov. Mr. Di continued, Bulgaria is trying to act in the spirit of the Yalta Agreement and fulfill the armistice agreement and peace treaty. According to this obligation, Bulgaria should not only guarantee the basic freedoms of the people, but also dissolve fascist groups and organizations that engage in anti-United Nations propaganda. The government cannot give freedom to those who attempt to revive fascism, or even prepare to seize power by force.

### Japan Conspired with Germany to Assassinate Stalin; US Discovers Documents in Germany

### Truman Wins Victory; House Supports Veto of Tax Cut Bill; Only Two Votes Difference; Mr. Du Claims It Was an Accident

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] The House of Representatives today, by a margin of two votes, supported President Truman's veto of the $40 billion income tax cut bill. The tax cut issue must be postponed until the 1948 presidential election. Republican Speaker of the House Martin said, "We may have to wait for a Republican president to be born before this matter can be implemented."

[United Press, Washington, 17th] President Truman returned to Washington from Princeton University on the 17th and was very pleased with the House of Representatives' vote to support the president's veto of the income tax cut bill. But Mr. Du must also quickly decide on the Taft-Hartley labor control bill, which is equally important politically. Truman said on his way back, "This move is better than I expected, and I am very grateful to the House of Representatives for supporting my veto." When reporters asked if the president intended to veto the Taft-Hartley bill, he said, "I don't know if I should veto it. I have not yet made a decision on this."

### Australia to Lead British Commonwealth in Participating in Negotiations on Peace Treaty with Japan; Australian Foreign Minister to Visit MacArthur to Exchange Views

[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] The future visit of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt to Japan indicates that Australia will be the leading country in the British Commonwealth in the Japanese peace treaty negotiations. It is reported that Mr. Yi will discuss the general outline of the peace treaty with Mr. Mai, and when the British Commonwealth Japan peace treaty issue conference is held in August, Mr. Yi can also present a report based on the observations he made during this trip.

Now all countries recognize that the main problem is to never allow Japan to become an aggressor again. MacArthur now believes that he has caused a spiritual revolution among the Japanese people, but those who pay attention to Japanese affairs still doubt the extent of the spiritual revolution. If all countries accept MacArthur's opinion, then the conditions for the peace treaty with Japan will naturally be more lenient. Japan's territory will almost certainly be limited to the four islands of the mainland. Its arms have been disarmed, and its resources are not enough to launch a war; however, the United States is still wary of the Soviet Union in the Far East, and this wariness has led some Allied personnel to support the strong police force and small air force requested by the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Japan has no hope of recovering the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin, or Okinawa, so there are quite a few people who propose that the air force control Japan from these bases after the peace treaty takes effect.

### Japanese Parliament to Convene as Scheduled

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] After the House of Representatives received the government's request to postpone the convening of the Diet, it convened the Diet Steering Committee on the 18th, and as a result, rejected the government's proposal to postpone the convening to July 1, and decided to hold the opening ceremony on the 23rd as scheduled.

### Rumor Says US Demands France End Conflict in French Indochina; Ho Chi Minh Says It Has Grown into a Long-Term War

[United Press, Washington, 17th] State Department officials confirmed to reporters today that the United States has requested France to take steps to end the conflict in French Indochina. The United States believes that the conflict in French Indochina is very relevant to the unrest in Asia. It is said that the US government gave Ambassador to France Buy Frey a long instruction several weeks ago, and Mr. Jia has officially discussed this matter with French officials, but the official declined to disclose whether the French side has made any guarantees. At the same time, French officials commented on the reports in Paris that the United States had requested France and Vietnam to stop the conflict, saying that since Mr. Jia requested this in Paris and Undersecretary of State Axon in Washington three months ago, the United States has not taken any new diplomatic action.

[Reuters, Saigon, 17th] Viet Minh Radio today broadcast President Ho Chi Minh's appeal to Asian friends, asking them to support the Viet Minh patriots' struggle for freedom. Mr. Ho also encouraged the Viet Minh soldiers and civilians to show more courageous battle achievements.

### US Maritime Strike Spreads to West Coast

[United Press, San Francisco, 18th] It is learned that the sailing schedule of ships on the West Coast has been cancelled because the seafarers' strike has affected the West Coast of the United States.

### Heart Transplant Successful in Soviet Doctor's Experiment

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] Temikov, a 30-year-old Soviet medical expert, told the Truth newspaper that he had successfully transplanted the heart and spleen of one dog to another, and connected one heart to the heart of another dog. However, none of the dogs survived for more than eight days after the surgery. This experiment is very important, because transplantation surgery can also be used to help humans survive when undergoing chest surgery. When Mr. Te experimented with transplanting an artificial heart into an animal body, the transplanted animal died after several hours. Mr. Te believes that the cause of death was not the malfunction of the artificial heart, but the coagulation of blood when it came into contact with the wall of the artificial heart. He believes that if an artificial heart is made of anti-coagulant material, and an anti-coagulant is injected into the blood at the same time, the artificial heart can complete its task.

### Japan Actively Reviving Fisheries; MacArthur Approves Huge Shipbuilding Plan; Total Tonnage Will Greatly Exceed Pre-War Levels

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] For the purpose of actively supporting Japan's fisheries, MacArthur's headquarters recently approved a huge Japanese industrial fishing vessel construction plan. According to this plan, Japan will be able to build 268 steel tuna boats and 17 large un-tuna boats, with a total tonnage of 35,300 tons. 442 steel trawlers, with a total tonnage of 40,900 tons. As a result of the implementation of this plan, Japan will be able to build 120 tuna boats with a tonnage of more than ten tons by the end of 1949, with a total tonnage of 72,800 tons, 59 otter trawlers, and another 933 so-called trawlers. The sum of the tonnage will exceed that before the war. By the end of this year, three major fishing fleets will be organized to engage in fishing activities. One-tenth of the East China Sea is also designated as a Japanese fishing ground. According to the person in charge of the Fisheries Section of the Natural Resources Bureau of MacArthur's Headquarters, Japanese fishing boats suffered heavy losses during the war. In 1939, there were about 860 tuna boats with a tonnage of more than 20 tons, totaling 53,600 tons, but in 1946, they decreased to 340, totaling 21,600 tons. In 1939, there were 67 water trawlers with a tonnage of more than 45 tons, which decreased to 16 last year, and another 68 trawlers, which decreased to 38 last year. Therefore, if this shipbuilding plan is not approved, Japan will not be able to maintain its minimum level of fisheries.

Japanese Whaling Fleet to Go to Antarctica

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Government authorities recently told this news agency's reporter that the US Senate and House of Representatives are expected to approve MacArthur's request to allow Japan to send a whaling fleet to Antarctica again in the autumn and winter seasons of this year, or will reply to MacArthur's approval by telegram this week.

### Commander Xuan's Speech

[Another Report] Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Yi Wu received reporters from various newspapers yesterday afternoon and answered questions as follows: Since the Economic Investigation Team was ordered to be established in February this year, it has achieved considerable success in stabilizing the financial situation. However, this kind of emergency measure was originally an expedient measure, and the Garrison Headquarters has recently been focusing all its efforts on security, and has no time to take care of it. Therefore, it telegraphed the Chairman a few days ago to request its termination, and the army chairman approved it, and it will be officially terminated on the 18th. Hereafter, events that violate economic laws will be handled by the municipal government. As for the investigation of the Qianzhuang fraud incident on Nanjing Road, there is still no report.

### Labor and Management Should Understand Each Other

Mr. Xuan explored the current economic problems, and said that solutions should be sought from the root. The fundamental solution lies in the fact that social groups should be organized immediately, generate power, and cooperate and liaise with the government, and prices can be stabilized naturally. With stable prices, low salaries and low wages can also lead to a comfortable life. Now, people in general are abandoning the pursuit of the root and pursuing the branches, thinking that if prices rise, as long as salaries are high and wages are increased, life can be solved. They should know that if salaries and wages increase, prices will also double, and if this cycle continues, it will lead to economic collapse. Therefore, if labor and management can understand each other and coordinate, labor disputes can be avoided.

### Recent Situation of Arrested Students

Regarding the general concern about the current handling and situation of students and reporters arrested on suspicion of being communist conspirators, Mr. Xuan answered reporters' inquiries, stating: The arrested students have not suffered any pain. They are now temporarily isolated from the school. During this time, experts often conduct joint discussions on the problems they have imagined and enable them to have a deeper understanding of current political issues to avoid superficial and immature remarks and actions. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say that they are being educated rather than punished. The situation of the arrested reporters is roughly the same.

### No Traces of Bandits in Neighboring Counties

Mr. Xuan continued to tell reporters that within the new garrison area, after the implementation of the bandit suppression and village cleansing and joint defense plan, there are no more bandit groups in the counties. A few days ago, in Nanhui, Chuansha, and Fengxian counties, there were several groups of bandits. After troops were dispatched to suppress them, they fled to Zhejiang separately and are being pursued by the Zhejiang security forces.

The current site of the garrison headquarters will be moved out due to the owner's request for repossession. The new site is located in the current port headquarters on Jiangwan Road. The port headquarters has agreed to cede half of the space and a guest house to the garrison headquarters. After repairs and renovations, it is scheduled to move in on July 1st.

### People's Food Allocation Committee Approves the Allocation of Over 10,000 Shi of Rice

Relocation of Office Starts from the 22nd

[Report from Our Newspaper] The People's Food Allocation Committee is scheduled to move from the Shandong Fellow Villagers Association to the Lawyers' Association on Huangpi South Road for office work on the 22nd of this month. According to Secretary Zhang of the committee yesterday: Although the Municipal Bank has sent staff to the committee to collect payments, it is limited to banker's drafts. In order to simplify the rice allocation procedures, the Allocation Committee plans to have its cashiers collect small amounts of cash on behalf of the Municipal Bank and issue receipts to avoid the trouble of payers having to go to the bank. Since the application for rice allocation closed on the 21st, there has been a surge of applications. Among the more than 1,700 backlog cases transferred by the Social Affairs Bureau, more than 1,300 have been processed, and more than 10,000 shi of rice have been approved for distribution. The rice allocated to workers recently was all for industrial workers. Occupational workers, such as dock workers and rickshaw pullers, have not yet submitted their lists. For poor people's subsidized rice, letters have been sent to the Civil Affairs Bureau urging all districts to complete the preparations for subsidized rice distribution so that it can begin before the end of the month.

### A Group of Children Living an Inhuman Life: Over Twenty Apprentices from Hua Fu Factory Appeal to the Social Affairs Bureau for Assistance

[Report from Our Newspaper] More than twenty apprentices from the Hua Fu Machine Factory on Tongbei Road went to the Social Affairs Bureau twice yesterday, in the morning and afternoon, to petition for assistance. They were shabbily dressed, with red and swollen eyes, and covered in oil. They were all children of about ten years old. It is said that the factory owner, named Yang Gendang, is an adjunct of the volunteer police brigade. There are more than ten old foremen and more than twenty apprentices in the factory. They start work every morning and do not stop until 12 o'clock at night. After stopping work, they have to clean up and tidy up the workshop before they can sleep. Last month, their monthly wages were 6,000 yuan per person, and this month it has been increased to 10,000 yuan. A few days ago, the factory wanted to add two more hours of work after 12 o'clock. Because they were overworked and unable to do any more, they resisted slightly in their words, which led to the factory owner beating them severely with firewood, injuring five people including Zhang Henian, Zhang Xianghong, and Lu Yunxiang. They had nowhere to complain, so they could only go to the Social Affairs Bureau to ask for assistance. Director Zhao of the Labor Affairs Bureau promised to summon the factory owner to the bureau today for talks and persuade them to return to the factory. However, the apprentices were afraid of being beaten again and claimed that they did not dare to return to the factory.

After hearing the news, the Fourth District Machinery Industry Workers' Union decided to send representatives to negotiate with the factory owner today and submit a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting protection for child laborers.

### Labor-Management Arbitration Committee Meeting: Discussion of Index Discount Standards

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Labor-Management Arbitration Committee is scheduled to meet at 3:00 p.m. today. At that time, concrete decisions will be made on the index discount standards and the method of paying wages for the current month according to the index of the previous month.

### Citywide Silk Weaving Industry: Three-Hour Slowdown

Wage Disputes Reject Price Index Discounts

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the issue of cost of living index discounts in the silk weaving industry in all four districts, the Social Affairs Bureau has convened several mediation sessions. The employers insisted that a uniform discount of 66% be applied, while the employees demanded that a uniform discount of 90% be applied to wages above 30 yuan. The opinions of the two sides failed to converge. The employers then appealed to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for a public judgment. However, the employees believed that the production relations of the silk weaving industry were special and insisted that the index, base salary, and base number should not be changed. The Social Affairs Bureau considered that the actual situation of the industry was different, did not make a mediation decision, and submitted the evaluation to the arbitration committee. Upon hearing this, the workers were deeply dissatisfied. The workers of more than 400 factories citywide staged a slowdown from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. yesterday to express their protest and sent more than 50 representatives, including Lu Lunyan, Tao Yunshan, and Zhou Yunlong, to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition Director Wu to allow the representatives to present their opinions at the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee meeting to be held today.

### Xie Baosheng's Illicit Property: Invitation to Tender for Lease

Xie Baosheng, the deputy director of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Police Department, is still being detained by the court. Xie's illicit property is very large, and all of it has been seized by the enemy and puppet property handling agency, pending a verdict before confiscation. A portion of the property that can be used for production, such as the Kader Bathhouse and the Xinzha Hotel, are well-equipped. The enemy and puppet property liquidation office had previously agreed to allow Xie's son to manage and operate it on behalf of his father. Later, because Xie's son was unable to develop the business, the illicit property handling committee decided to publicly invite tenders for lease. The reserve price was set at 50 million yuan by the committee. The lease term is from the first of next month to the end of this year, a total of six months. The deadline for bidding is tomorrow. The public opening of bids will be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 21st. The winning bidder only needs to pay rent to the liquidation office each month, and all surplus business profits belong to the winning bidder. It is also rumored that the Xie-owned shares of the large-scale Xianyue Dance Palace have all been sold. The enemy and puppet property liquidation office has sent staff to thoroughly investigate this matter to determine whether it should be seized according to law.

### Retirement Funds for Former Shanghai Municipal Council Employees: Process and Issue Immediately

[Report from Our Newspaper] The retirement funds for Chinese employees and police officers of the former Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession have been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Property Liquidation Committee for allocation. The first batch of 20 billion national currency yuan has been allocated in full by the central government. All 3,500 registration forms for former employees and police officers of the former Shanghai Municipal Council who have received a public notice have been submitted to the meeting. A review committee has been established today, with two members each from the Liquidation Committee, the Finance Bureau, the Personnel Department, the Secretariat, and the Accounting Department, and two consultants each from the Former Municipal Council Employee General Association and the Police Officers' Association. The first review meeting will be held today to discuss the division of work. The review will start immediately, and payments will be processed and issued as soon as they are reviewed. All retired employees and police officers who have received a notice must bring their identification documents and collect their payments on the designated date.

### Three Bureau Directors Request the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (JRRA) to Allocate Epidemic Prevention Equipment and Medicines

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Director of the Health Bureau, Zhang Wei, the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zeng, and the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Zhao Zukang, hosted a banquet at the City Bank on Jiujiang Road last night at 7:00 p.m. for the responsible persons of the JRRA and the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA). Director Zhang reported that the weather is getting hot and epidemics are about to take the opportunity to rise. Although the epidemic prevention work is being actively launched by the Epidemic Prevention Office, it is limited by financial and material resources and cannot be promoted on a large scale. It is hoped that the JRRA will provide assistance in terms of equipment and medicines. According to reports, the most prevalent areas of cholera in the city last year were the shantytowns of Zhabei, West Shanghai, and Nanshi. Because there are no tap water facilities in these areas, residents get their drinking water from earthen wells and polluted ditches, which leads to the breeding of epidemics. Therefore, the Health Bureau plans to connect them to tap water, which is estimated to require approximately 551,000 feet of tap water pipes. There is no such large quantity of water pipes in the city to supply, so it will be necessary to borrow the help of the JRRA to prevent them in time so that the shantytowns can be spared from the catastrophe.

### More Than One Hundred Floating Corpses Have Been Recovered One After Another: The Total Number of Passengers Who Died in the Dafeng Disaster is Difficult to Estimate; Salvage and Burial Continue; Families Discuss Post-Disaster Arrangements

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Pushan Villa in the city, for the handling of the salvage and burial of the passengers who died in the Dafeng shipping disaster, sent another three cars yesterday, carrying more than 40 family members, accompanied by four employees of the shipping company, to the riverside areas of Shiziling in Baoshan County and Liuhe in Taicang. On the Shiziling beach, two more floating corpses were recovered, which were collected by Pushan Villa, but the coffin lids were not nailed so that family members could identify them.

Digging Up Corpses and Identifying Two

At the same time, together with the Shishan County Public Security Bureau, more than 30 corpses buried by nearby residents a few days ago were dug up one by one for family members to identify. All the corpses were rotten and beyond recognition due to water immersion and soil burial. Some were even missing limbs, and some corpses had their clothes washed away by the flood when they were salvaged. Therefore, only two of the more than 30 corpses were identified and claimed by the families of the deceased. One was Zhang Xinliang, male, 35 years old, and the other was also claimed by his family, but the company did not have a record of his name.

Sending Divers to Search the Ship

The salvagers on the Taicang side have not yet returned to Shanghai as of late at night, and the details are unknown. In total, since the Dafeng accident, more than 120 corpses have been salvaged in Baoshan, Taicang, and Liuhe, and new corpses are still being discovered one after another. Therefore, the total number of passengers who died in the Dafeng disaster is still impossible to estimate at this time. The shipping company has decided to send the Shenhua ship with divers to the sea surface where the Dafeng ship sank at 9:00 a.m. this morning, and the divers will dive into the sunken Dafeng ship to search for corpses.

Preliminary Consultation, No Lawsuit for Now

The families of the passengers who died in the disaster held a meeting at the Nantong Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association on Beihai Road yesterday to discuss how to handle the aftermath. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspapers to the ports along the river to pay attention to the rescued passengers, they also demanded that the company continue to salvage the corpses, and that the shipping company pay compensation to the families of the passengers who have been confirmed dead or missing. At the same time, they requested the maritime authorities to ban all old ships or ships with poor life-saving equipment in order to protect the safety of passengers in the future. In order to understand the shipping company, the families will not file a lawsuit for the time being, but will first conduct direct consultations, hoping to reach a reasonable solution.

Shipping Bureau Says Force Majeure

According to the Dafeng Shipping Bureau, the cause of the accident was entirely due to force majeure, and on the night of the 9th of this month, in the midst of a fierce storm, in addition to the sinking of the Dafeng ship, more than 100 other sailing boats and fishing boats were overturned. Therefore, the hundreds of floating corpses that have been discovered in recent days are definitely not all passengers of the Dafeng ship, but it is difficult to identify them because the corpses are rotten. As for the aftermath, consultations will be held after the corpses have been properly disposed of.

### Surveillance Commissioner Yan Returns to Shanghai After Inspection: Discusses the Peacefulness and Tranquility of the Order in Various Places

Jiangsu Surveillance Commissioner Yan Zhuangguo returned to Shanghai on the evening of the 17th after inspecting the three counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou. Mr. Yan told reporters on the 18th: People in all the places he visited filed complaints, and he investigated and handled them in detail one by one. At present, the order in various places is still peaceful and tranquil, and the recovery work is also progressing. Although the conscription of soldiers and grain causes some suffering to the people, the way it is being handled is significantly better than in the past, and there are few flaws in local politics. Mr. Yan expressed his indignation at the incident in which the military officer corps stationed in Tongli, Wujiang, raped and killed the female teacher Zou Yue'e. He said that the 2,000 members of the corps are scattered in residential homes, and smoking, gambling, and prostitution occur from time to time. The Ministry of National Defense urgently needs to deal with it properly. The surveillance commissioner has sent staff to thoroughly investigate this rape and murder case. He also pointed out that the recent cracking of the case in Changzhou involving the private supply of military fire to the Communist Party in northern Jiangsu is noteworthy. The incident had occurred for more than half a year, and rumors had been circulating among the people for a long time, but it was not cracked until recently, which shows that it was definitely not done by ordinary merchants and civilians.

### Unemployed Workers Coming to Shanghai from the Rear: To Be Resettled or Repatriated; Li Jianhua Talks After Returning to Shanghai from Nanjing

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Jianhua, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and Director of the Unemployed Workers Assistance Committee, was summoned to Nanjing by the Ministry of Social Affairs on the 14th to discuss the way out and relief for unemployed workers. There are still more than 1,800 unemployed workers from the rear areas who came to Shanghai at the Yangshupu Military Industry Road Reception Center. Because the CNRRA is coming to an end, the supply is becoming a problem, and a decision from the Ministry of Social Affairs is pending. Mr. Li returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official duties in Nanjing. He told reporters yesterday afternoon: In addition to the unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear areas, there have been many factory shutdowns and layoffs recently due to shrinking production, totaling more than 100,000 people according to investigations. During this trip to Nanjing, the Ministry of Social Affairs held a total of three meetings, all chaired by Minister Gu. Two principles were decided after research: (1) The Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Resources Committee will open up methods to resettle unemployed workers. (2) Those who voluntarily return to their hometowns will be given severance pay. Those who cannot be resettled or cannot return to their hometowns will still be given relief. The Ministry of Social Affairs will invite the above-mentioned agencies to discuss resettlement methods within days. This relief principle is temporarily limited to unemployed workers who came to Shanghai from the rear areas. General unemployment is not covered by this example.

### The Eight Defendants in the National Grain Loan Case Are Found Not Guilty; Meeting the Requirements of the Amnesty Decree Should Be Pardoned

[Report from Our Newspaper] The grain loan case, which shook the country and lasted for more than a year, was pronounced in the local court yesterday. Criminal Division Chief Wu Yegua, accompanied by Judges Huang Guangyu, Mei Erhe (acting), and Clerk [blank], took the prisoners Wang Yunren, Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, and Wu Rongsheng, etc., and took their seats in the second criminal court. All four defendants on bail, Ren Xingyai, Wan Molin, Xing Zhigang, and Yang Runyu, were not present in court. Chief Judge Wu stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, Wan Molin, Xing Zhigang, Yang Runyu, Wang Daren, and Ren Xingyai are all found not guilty." Chief Judge Wu sat down and briefly stated the reasons for the judgment, and then instructed the prisoners to remain in custody for the time being, pending the determination of this judgment, before being released. The lawyers of the defendants requested permission to post bail because the defendants had been detained until now, and since they have now been found not guilty, they submitted a written application to be decided at a later date. The reasons for the judgment are appended below:

Reasons

Those who committed crimes before December 31, 1946, and whose most severe sentence is imprisonment of less than a fixed term shall be pardoned. Moreover, those who have been previously granted amnesty shall be given a judgment of non-guilty. Article A of the National Government's January 1, 1947 Amnesty Decree and Article 294, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure clearly stipulate that the defendant Wang Xunzhi in this case is the Deputy General Manager of the Yangtze River Company, and Zhuang Hanzhang is its Business Director. The defendant Wan Molin is the Manager of the Wanchang Rice Shop. In April of last year, the central government, in response to the request of the Shanghai Municipal Government Chamber of Commerce Temporary Council and local communities, ordered the Shanghai Grain Administration Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Food to organize grain loans, lending 600,000 legal tender to the company and rice shop. The defendants, taking advantage of the rising grain prices, concealed the rice purchased with the loans without selling it, or bought and sold it themselves, with the intention of manipulating it. The defendant Wu Pingsheng is the manager of the Santai Rice Shop, and he resold the rice entrusted to him for sale by the government to suppress grain prices without selling it. He engaged in speculative monopoly and manipulation of rice and grain. The defendant Wang Daren is the Acting Special Commissioner of the Shanghai Grain Administration Office, and Ren Xingyai is the Chief of the Regulation Section. Both bear the heavy responsibility of grain administration. Increasing the grain reserves in Shanghai and suppressing grain prices are their duties. In other words, they have the obligation to prevent rising grain prices, but the defendants had no thorough plan in advance and lacked emergency measures afterward,

and through inaction and delay

in a short month, grain prices soared from tens of thousands of yuan per shi to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, causing public panic and widespread criticism. They even announced the suspension of the sale of loaned rice on May 1, citing market chaos, which was an act of helping speculative monopoly and manipulation, and the circumstances were obvious. Subsequently, the Jiangsu Surveillance Commissioner of the Control Yuan filed an impeachment, and the criminal part was transferred to the prosecutor of this court for investigation and clarification. The defendants Zhu Xuanzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Wan Molin were charged with Article 31 of the Emergency Period Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations, and the defendants Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai were charged with Article 31 of the same regulations, Article 15, Article 30, and Article 134 of the Criminal Code.

A public prosecution was filed.

Article 12 of the Emergency Period Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations clearly stipulates that "Producers or operators of designated enterprises and goods shall not engage in speculative monopoly or other manipulative behavior." Article 31 of the same regulations also stipulates that "Those who violate the provisions of Article 12 and engage in speculative monopoly or other manipulative behavior shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than five years and fined one to three times the profits obtained." This crime is a crime punishable by imprisonment of less than a fixed term, and the period of the defendants' crime was before December 31, 1946, so they could have been pardoned in time, but criminal proceedings are based on the discovery of

truth as the main goal

and Article 246 of the Code of Criminal Procedure also stipulates that "If the prosecutor prosecutes part of the facts of the crime, its effect extends to the whole." This case concerns the people's food, and since grain prices suddenly soared after the grain loan was organized, this court believes that there is a connection to whether there was collusion for personal gain and corruption, so it does not shy away from seeking details and conducts further investigation. Therefore, whether the defendants Wang Daren, etc. can be pardoned should also be determined by whether there are circumstances of seeking personal gain or corruption. This court repeatedly interrogated the defendants Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai, who both denied receiving review fees, referral fees, black market interest, or bribes from the grain merchants, nor did they have an agreement with the grain merchants to share profits. The grain merchants Zhu Yongming, Gu Yisheng, Chuan Changyu, Feng Yongsheng, Yu Liangji, Zhang Chao, Xu Taiyuan, Zhu Shilu, Wang Yuzhen, Lu Linxun, Xing Songwen, and Shao Jigao, who were brought to court,

were questioned separately

and all made sworn statements proving that they had never paid review fees, referral fees, black market interest, or bribes and any illegal benefits to the personnel of the Grain Administration Office. The witness Xu Jiliang also stated in court: "There is no such thing as collecting review fees or referral fees, and the grain administration personnel did not collude with the grain merchants." When asked "In terms of grain loans, did you hear about any illegal interest besides the official interest?", he said "I did not hear about it." The witness Xi Wangshu also stated in court that "The grain loans were organized by the government finding grain merchants, so why would grain merchants collude with grain administration personnel? The rise in grain prices was caused by the rice-producing areas raising prices one after another when they heard that Shanghai was organizing grain loans, and the main reason was actually inflation." When asked "Did the grain administration personnel take any money?", he replied "No." When asked again "In addition to the official interest of three points, was there any black interest on the loan?", he replied again "There is definitely no such thing as black interest."

Xu Jiliang is the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the speaker of the Shanghai Temporary Council of the People's Livelihood Organization at the time, and he has made a sworn statement, so his testimony

is credible.

Xi Tianshu is also the speaker of the Shanghai Temporary Council and has also made a sworn statement, and he has no grievances with the defendants, so his testimony is also worthy of adoption. Furthermore, after checking the files investigated by the prosecutors of this court and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and various account books and forms, no evidence has been found that the defendants Wang Daren, etc. colluded with each other for personal gain. According to Article 268 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, "The facts of the crime should be determined based on evidence," the fact that the defendants Wang Daren, etc. engaged in corruption and seeking personal gain cannot be determined. Therefore, the articles of law cited in the prosecutor's indictment cannot but be considered proper. Therefore, although the defendants Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, Wan Molin, Wang Daren, and Ren Xingyai have engaged in speculative monopoly, manipulative behavior, or helping speculative monopoly and manipulative behavior, constituting a crime under Article 31 of the Emergency Period Agricultural, Mining, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations, they are fortunate to be granted the grace of the national amnesty and meet the provisions of Article A of the National Government's January 1, 1947 Amnesty Decree,

and are spared pardon.

Except for the part of whether the defendants Wang Daren and Ren Xingyai were derelict in their duties, which is not within the scope of justice and will be handled separately by their competent authorities, the defendants Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, Wan Molin, Wang Daren, and Ren Xingyai shall be given a judgment of non-guilty. If the defendants Yang Runyu and Xing Zhigang privately assigned loans, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 339, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, even if the crime is established, because the most severe sentence for the crime is imprisonment of not more than five years, and the period of the crime was before December 31, 1946, it also meets the provisions of Article A of the Great Relief Order and should naturally be in the list of pardons, and

should be found not guilty. Based on the above arguments, the judgment shall be based on Article 294, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Article A of the National Government's Amnesty Decree, as stated in the main text.

### A Police Officer Dies After Injection of "Disease Extinguisher": Doctor's Assistant Detained

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Luchuan, 27 years old, from Shandong, a patrol officer who served in the Lao Zha District Police Station for many years, is currently employed in the Traffic Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau. Recently, he suffered from dry scabies and went to Dr. Huang Kefang's clinic at 346 Yunnan Road on the 10th for diagnosis. The doctor injected him with "disease exterminator," one injection every two or three days, and had already given four injections.

### Security Association Launches Campaign to Comfort Military, Police, and Gendarmerie: Decides to Request Banks to Advance 100 Million

The Social Security Promotion Association launched an initiative to invite various groups to raise funds to comfort the military, police, and gendarmerie of the city during the Dragon Boat Festival. Yesterday, due to the short time, it was unable to raise funds in an orderly manner. Therefore, Du Yuesheng, Pan Gongzhan, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiliang, Wu Yun, and other invited banking circles to discuss ways to advance funds. Liu Gongyun, Xu Guangjian, Zhao [blank]hua, Li Shuming, Dao Zhongtao, Wang Xinshu, and others attended. Du Yuesheng presided over the meeting and resolved to request the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank to advance 200 million yuan each, and the Municipal Bank, the Trust Bureau, the Postal Remittance Bureau, and the Cooperative Treasury to advance 100 million yuan each. Tongshang, Zhongshi, Siming, Jin Cheng, and Zhonghui banks were invited to be acceptance guarantors, with a time limit of one month. Du Yuesheng and other five people will come forward to apply. It was also decided that representatives of various groups would send the funds that had not been delivered to Commander Xuan to distribute to the military, police, and gendarmerie on the 21st of this month. It was also preliminarily decided how to repay this advance.

### Withdrawal of Charges in Assault Case; Seven Students from Shanghai Law College Released on Bail

Eleven students from Shanghai Law College, including Qu Yuan and Su Shuyuan, were involved in a case concerning their fellow students at the college. The case was previously investigated and concluded by the prosecutor's office, and charges were filed under Article 277, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The District Court had scheduled a hearing for the 14th of this month. However, as both parties wished to negotiate a settlement out of court, they applied for a postponement, which was approved by the presiding judge. Later, under the mediation of Chu Yi, the acting president of the college, the victims, including Mao Yong, submitted a written request for withdrawal of the charges on the afternoon of the 18th. The presiding judge, considering that the crime involved was subject to prosecution only upon complaint, ruled that the case would not be accepted since the charges had been withdrawn. The seven defendants in custody, namely Qu Yuan, Tang Kefei, Yang Hui, Xia Wei, Zheng Ce'an, Li Shuxi, and Tian Jiyi, were released on bail from the District Court Detention Center on the afternoon of the 18th at 4:00 PM, in accordance with the law.

### Auction of German Overseas Chinese Properties Yields 34 Billion; Remaining Pigments and Medicines Valued at Approximately 150 Billion

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The German Overseas Chinese Property Liquidation Office has been liquidating the properties of German Overseas Chinese for the past year, and this work has now come to an end. According to rough estimates by the person in charge of the office, the proceeds from auctions since the beginning of the liquidation amount to 25 billion yuan for Defu pigments, 7.2 billion yuan for Bayer medicines, and approximately 2 billion yuan for other miscellaneous items and furniture, totaling more than 34 billion yuan. Except for a small portion of Defu pigments and Bayer medicines, all other properties of German overseas Chinese, including the small amount of remaining stock and assets from German trading companies such as Lihe, Siemens, Meizuishi, Kongshi, and Lulin, have been completely liquidated. Although the quantity of remaining pigments and medicines is only a small fraction of what was originally received, due to rising prices, the current estimated value of the pigments is approximately 120 billion yuan, and the value of the medicines is approximately 30 billion yuan. Because the government had a plan to establish state-owned factories at the beginning of this year, these remaining pigments and medicines were not auctioned. However, due to changes in economic policy, which emphasized the private operation of small industries, state-owned institutions were not established.

### Cultural Seedling in the Jungle; Lushan Library

— Report from Nanchang by Our Newspaper Reporter Liu Zao on the 12th

The Lushan Library is a cultural seedling in the jungle of Guling. It was proposed to be built fourteen years ago in the summer, and the library site was completed in July of the 24th year of the Republic of China. During the founding process, Chairman Chiang inspected the construction, and the location of the library was chosen by the chairman himself. The old man who used to live in a dilapidated house can still describe the process of choosing the library site in detail.

Served as Barracks for Isolated Troops

In the past years, it was unfortunately washed by more than eight years of war, serving as barracks for isolated troops in Lushan and used by the Japanese army as a military ammunition depot. It fell to the enemy on April 18th of the 28th year, along with Guling, and it was not until October 29th of the 34th year that it was restored. Now, it still stands tall under Guniu Ridge, becoming an emerging business in Lushan.

Last summer, Chairman Chiang came to Guling and ordered the Executive Yuan to subsidize the library's operating expenses by 20 million yuan. The Jiangxi Provincial Government approved the distribution of the operating expenses, with 9 million yuan for new book purchases, 6 million yuan for copying and supplementing missing volumes, and 5 million yuan for various equipment expenses. After receiving this subsidy, the library began to organize last winter, and now it is classifying and cataloging books.

Increased Rare Books After the War

The collection of the Lushan Library was small before the war because it was established in a short time. The number of books is not currently available in the catalog or records. After the war, the library received a lot of rare books because the books collected from various places were looted by the Japanese army and came to the mountains. According to the report at the time of the reception, there were 53,321 volumes of Chinese books and 8,864 volumes of Western books, totaling 62,185 volumes. Among these books, the 8,864 volumes of Western books are stored in a special room, and the 53,321 volumes of Chinese books are two-thirds thread-bound ancient books and one-third ordinary modern books, which are also stored in separate rooms.

Need Copying Talent

Among the Chinese ancient books, there are nearly 10,000 volumes of rare books, of which about 120 volumes are missing and need to be copied and supplemented, and about 1,000 volumes need to be bound and repaired. They are now in need of specialists who are good at copying and repairing. Among these thread-bound ancient books, there are more belonging to the history and collection categories and fewer belonging to the classics and philosophy categories. Only a dozen books belong to the category of books on rhymes, and the category of books on records only includes the provincial and county records of 35 provinces and their subordinate counties.

Most of the ordinary books were published before the 26th year of the Republic of China, and most of them were published by the Commercial Press, totaling more than 21,000 volumes. However, there are many duplicates. After removing the duplicates, there are only more than 8,000 original copies. There is also a shortage of reference books.

Officially Opens This Summer

They are now preparing to officially open this summer, and most of the preparatory work has been completed. They will also set up street reading rooms and cultural apartments in Lotus Cave and Guling City to accommodate celebrities and scholars at low cost. They also plan to hold academic seminars and lectures.

[Reuters, Stockholm, 17th] If the report submitted today by the "Amateur Qualification" Subcommittee is accepted by the International Olympic Committee meeting here, amateur athletes in next year's Olympic World Games can receive compensation for lost wages without violating amateur rules. The definition of "amateur athlete" in the report submitted by the subcommittee is as follows: "An amateur athlete is one who does not have any material gain, whether direct or indirect, for athletic competition other than considering it a sport." Sports circles claim that compensation for lost wages after participating in sports competitions is not a gain, but merely an avoidance of loss. However, the final interpretation will be decided by the national sports associations themselves.

[Guoguang News Agency, Kaifeng] The Zheng Lun basketball team, after leaving Shanghai on the 8th of this month and arriving in Beijing, was summoned by Minister Bai and completed all negotiations. They started their triumphant return and arrived here on the 15th. A special correspondent from Guoguang News Agency visited the Zheng Lun team at the 6th Regiment of the Construction High School in Xiaonanmen today. According to team leader Wu Jian, "After leaving Shanghai, our team stayed in the capital for four days and was summoned by Minister Bai. The minister is very concerned about military sports, so we visited him three times and discussed many plans for military sports in the future. Captain Cai Zhongqi's appendicitis has been arranged with the Capital Central Hospital, and the expenses will be borne by the Ministry of National Defense. Therefore, Cai Zhongqi will stay in Beijing for surgery. It is expected that he will be discharged from the hospital and return to the defense in a week." Regarding how to promote military sports in the future, team leader Wu continued, "We are currently planning it. Once we have formulated specific measures, we will immediately report to all sectors of society."

### ·Shen Tianyi Cup Basketball Tournament· Grand Final Held

[Guoguang News Agency, Shenyang] The Tianyi Cup basketball tournament sponsored by the Shenyang branch of the Lizhi Society has been held since the start of the tournament, with a single round-robin system. The champions of the five divisions have been produced, and they are the teams Tax Union, Zhongchang, Shenqing, Daqing, and Fourth Middle School. After the sponsor decided to use a single round-robin system for the overall final, this overall final started at 2:00 p.m. on the 3rd in the gym of the society, and Mrs. Xiong, the director's wife, personally attended the opening ceremony. The audience was crowded, setting a record for the Shenyang basketball tournament after the war, and the situation was very enthusiastic. In the first game, Shenqing defeated Zhongchang 45-28. In the second game, Daqing defeated Fourth Middle School 33-22. The second act of the overall final on the 5th was also very exciting. In the first battle, Tax Union played against Fourth Middle School. Tax Union was the champion of the Zhongzheng Cup last year, and its players such as Ma Chunhe and Liu Jianhua were all first-class players in the basketball world with superb skills. It is hoped that they will be selected to attend the National Games, so the team's strength is very strong. Fourth Middle School was no match for them. As a result, Tax Union defeated Fourth Middle School 54-17. In the second act, Shenqing played against Daqing. The battle was very intense, but Daqing's actions were rude and fouled repeatedly. In the third quarter, when Shenqing led 17-11, Daqing's actions became even more violent. The referee successively penalized two players from the Daqing team. Daqing did not reflect on its actions and announced that it would abstain. It did not care about sportsmanship, which is a pity for the sports world. Shenqing won two consecutive games.

### Tea Production May Increase Three or Fourfold This Year; Tea Merchants Hope Government Will Purchase; Can Be Exchanged for US$2 Million at Current Prices

The tea season in various regions is coming to an end, but the purchase work is not being actively promoted as other export goods. According to tea industry leaders, last year's tea production was about 80,000 dan. This year, tea farmers in various regions have made arrangements for weeding and fertilizing, and the total production is expected to increase three or fourfold, with a total amount estimated to reach 300,000 dan. However, tea merchants believe that the originally planned tea loans are too far from the actual needs, which has reduced their interest. According to the tea loan principle, tea merchants must first raise funds to purchase raw tea and then apply for loans. Tea merchants are based on the fact that last year's old tea inventory was stagnant, and the capital loss was huge. Before the inventory is sold, it is impossible for new tea to be purchased in large quantities. Currently, the only finished tea for export is Qihong, which totals 25,000 boxes, equivalent to 12,000 shi dan. Other teas such as Tunlv, which can produce more than 35,000 dan, and Pinglv, which can produce more than 70,000 dan, are limited by capital and cannot be developed. If these problems can be solved, the total number of red and green tea for export should not be difficult to reach more than 100,000 boxes. Although the peak tea season has passed, it is still possible to recover by catching up. The method is nothing more than the government quickly issuing a purchase policy for entrusting tea merchants to produce raw tea on their behalf. The most reasonable suggestion is to convert it according to the price of rice. It is also said that tea is a major export commodity of our country. If 100,000 dan of boxed tea is estimated, it can be exchanged for about 2 million US dollars according to the current overseas price ratio, which can enrich the national army. It can also maintain the international market and prevent it from being seized by other countries' tea. In addition, if tea farmers in producing areas benefit and the rural economy is active, it can also help with social security problems.

### After Continuous Rise in Yongsha Shares, the Trend Turned Weak Near Closing

After continuing to rise yesterday, the major players in the Huagu market were exhausted and unable to sustain their momentum. Whenever Yongsha shares moved, small shares went from bad to worse. Since the loopholes could not be filled, and the news that Fangjian would pay a huge settlement today and that the securities margin would adopt a progressive system was frequently reported, the market finally became timid near the close, and the trend was unfavorable.

At the beginning of the morning, the market was slightly firmer due to the news of the economic reform plan. After Yongsha shares opened higher, numbers 54, 185, and 223 bought, and numbers 94, 148, and 154 bought Yongsha shares in cash, pushing the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares to 7,900 yuan. Numbers 218 and 50 sold Yongsha shares in cash, and numbers 19, 234, 155, and 154 sold to 7,790 yuan. Numbers 89, 78, 142, and 32 still bought, and numbers 219 and 76 also bought Yongsha shares in cash, rising to 7,900 yuan. Numbers 154, 186, 162, and 129 sold to 7,770 yuan. Numbers 76, 32, 148, 224, 223, and 155 came in to buy, and numbers 219 and 152 bought Yongsha shares in cash again, pushing the price to 7,770 yuan, and the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares also rose to a high price of 7,600 yuan. Numbers 108, 234, 14, and 200 sold, and number 83 also sold Yongsha shares in cash. Although Lianhua Real Estate was raised to the limit by number 162 again, it was still forced down to 7,750 yuan. Business was raised to the limit by number 17 and others, and numbers 24, 48, and 97 bought again to 7,900 yuan. Due to rumors that Fangjian would pay a huge settlement of 120 billion yuan, numbers 60, 157, 235, 102, 163, and 153 settled their positions, and at 11:30, the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares fell to 7,620 yuan. However, at noon, due to the strong buying by numbers 157, 35, and 231, plus numbers 104 and 61 also buying Yongsha shares in cash, the last movement pushed the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares to 7,850 yuan. After number 3 sold Yongsha shares in cash, numbers 112, 223, 119, 61, and 100 sold, and near the close, the immediate delivery of Yongsha shares fell to 7,510 yuan. Yongsha shares in cash were 7,180 yuan. It was rumored in the market that the margin deposit would adopt a progressive system if it exceeded 30 billion yuan, and it was also said that representatives of the brokers' association would go to Beijing in the evening to discuss the matter. The noon closing was slightly stable. After the closing, numbers 100 and 8 sold again, and the asking price was as low as 7,470 yuan. As a result, it was comparable to the previous closing. In terms of immediate delivery, Yongsha, Xinguang, Jingfu, Dongxing, Xinhe, and Meiya Xinhua fell slightly, Zhongfa and Huafeng each fell by half a percentage point, Yonggong alone rose slightly, Business rose to the limit and then rebounded, rising by half a percentage point, Lianhua rose to the limit, Neiyi, Datong, and Zhongfang rose slightly, Jinglun rose by a little less than 10%, Guohuo rose by half a percentage point, Huochai, Wuhe, and Tongyi fell slightly, Shuini and Xinya fell by half a percentage point, and Liana fell by 10%. Zhongsir and Rongfeng were flat. In terms of forward delivery, Yongsha, Xinguang, and Yonggong rose slightly, and Xinhe, Meiya, Huaqin, and Jingfu fell slightly. Most of the old shares outside the market were weak.

In swap trading, the arbitrage interest rate was yesterday between 1.3 jiao and 1.7 jiao, mostly around 1.5 jiao. Yongsha was bid up by numbers 220, 45, 110, 56, 74, 106, and 177. After opening at 380 yuan, it retreated to 320 yuan. Numbers 85, 102, 117, and 235 bid down, and finally settled at around 350 yuan. Huafeng was 5 yuan to 5.5 yuan, Xinguang was 6.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan, and Xinhe was 120 yuan to 145 yuan. The banks will be closed on the 20th of this month, and the stock exchange will also be closed for one day.

### Uniform Bonds Flat, Foreign Shares Declining

Government bonds were flat yesterday, only Uniform Bond E showed a slight rise, with a limited range of fluctuations. Uniform Bond C opened in the morning at 7,300 yuan, with a low of 7,200 yuan, a high of 7,700 yuan, and finally hovered around 7,400 yuan. Rooms 555, 503, and 360 all bought, and rooms 552, 604, and 230 all sold. As a result, compared with the previous closing, A, B, and D were all flat, Uniform Bond C rose slightly by 100 yuan, Uniform Bond E also rose by 300 yuan, and the turnover was about 5.6 million yuan.

Foreign shares were quite weak yesterday, and small shares such as Shipping and Steel were even more unsustainable. Yi Sha opened in the morning at 69,600 yuan, with limited trading. Retail investors were in and out, and securities firms supplied, gradually falling to a low price of 65,000 yuan, and then stabilizing. Hong Kong Shen Dian Hui rose to about 14.5 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Shipping and Steel each fell by more than 10%, Ying Lianye Guang each fell by less than 10%, and Yi Sha, Hui De Feng Paper, and Yi Beer each fell by about half a percentage point.

### Food Rice People's Hearts Firm

Yesterday, a total of more than 5,200 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets. The interior was selling well, and the people's hearts were firm. Both japonica and indica rice in the two markets rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, but the turnover at the close was still sluggish, and the situation was weak to rise. The low price of flour also affected the rice market to some extent.

Due to the large supply from factories, the allocation of flour continued, and the market was stable. Bran was actively sold in rural areas, gradually rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake was in great demand for actual sales, continuing to rise by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The supply of oil from the northeast decreased, and customers were confident, soaring by 40,000 to 60,000 yuan. The shops strengthened their purchases. Soybeans were still firm, green beans temporarily stabilized, and red beans remained unchanged.

Red grain was sluggish and returned to 2,000 to 3,000 yuan lower. Corn was not selling well, falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Hunan turned around, falling by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Sesame was still firm and continued to rise. Broad beans were pouring in, the market was sluggish, and they were falling steadily, cutting another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat was temporarily stable.

### Arrival of Foreign Rice in Shanghai

[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Chen" ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Rangoon, carrying 7,000 tons (approximately 70,000 bags) of small-sized rice. It is docked at buoys 11 and 12 for unloading and transfer.

Furthermore, the British company's "Awdh" ship, carrying over 9,900 bales of cotton from Mumbai, arrived at the port the day before yesterday evening and is currently berthed at the Kung Ho Cheung Wharf for unloading.

### Cotton Prices Trending High

Yesterday's cotton market saw rising cotton yarn prices, strengthening market confidence, and a universally bullish outlook. Yarn factories, selling finished products, were eager to replenish raw materials, creating substantial demand. Dealers actively sought to secure supplies, leading to intense competition among traders. The market was characterized by strong buying interest, but holders were inclined to observe and were unwilling to sell easily, creating a competitive buying atmosphere. Transaction volumes for high-grade cotton were limited, while those for ordinary cotton were slightly lower than the previous day. Afternoon trading saw opening prices for factory delivery: Lingbao cotton ranged from 1,595,000 to 1,620,000, 1,630,000 to 1,650,000. Shashi cotton ranged from 1,440,000 to 1,490,000 to 1,500,000. Tongzhou cotton was priced at 1,400,000, and Hankou fine cotton at 1,200,000. Prices for warehouse delivery opened with Lingbao cotton at 1,550,000 and 1,670,000, Tongzhou cotton at 1,250,000 to 1,275,000, and Hankou fine cotton at 1,140,000, 1,200,000 to 1,330,000, and 1,430,000. Mixed coarse Hankou fine cotton was at 1,170,000, Laohekou cotton at 1,330,000, Chongshashi cotton at 1,380,000, fire-engine cotton at 1,120,000, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 192,000 to 212,000 per bundle. (Note) The significant price difference between the lowest and highest prices of Hankou fine cotton was due to excessive mixing of coarse cotton within the fine cotton and excessive moisture content, failing to meet standards. According to common cotton market practice, most cotton grades involve a mix of coarse and fine fibers. Fine cotton with only 10-20% coarse fiber content is considered a higher grade, hence the higher price.

### Stable Silk and Satin Prices

Yesterday's rayon market remained firm, similar to the previous day. No. 120 Gaoshan shiny rayon opened at 19,750,000 yuan, but due to weak actual sales, the price declined. The noon closing price was 19,600,000 yuan, and in the afternoon, a small transaction of 19,500,000 yuan took place. The Dongyang brand was traded at 9,650,000 yuan in the afternoon for goods without wooden crates. No transactions were recorded for No. 75 Golden Rooster semi-gloss rayon, and the asking price remained unchanged.

The factory-direct silk market was also firm yesterday. Grade C silk saw official transactions, with new goods priced at 25,000,000 yuan and old goods at 24,230,000 yuan, both with seven-day terms. Grade D new goods were quoted at 4,500,000 yuan, and other grades maintained the same asking prices as the previous day. New goods were sold separately. Transactions yesterday were recorded at several levels, ranging from 22,500,000 to 23,500,000 yuan. Thrown silk remained sluggish, and asking prices showed no change. Yesterday's silk fabrics market continued to be brisk. Da Cheng quilt covers were quoted at 9,400,000 yuan, while Hua Qiang quilt covers were traded at 9,200,000 yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan from the previous day. Da Cheng checkered crepe opened at 34,600-34,700 yuan, but due to strong trading interest, the price rose. The final closing price was 50,000 yuan for spot, and 52,000 yuan for next-day delivery, up 500 yuan from the previous day. In the rayon fabrics market, Hua Jin crepe saw high-grade goods traded at 18,000 yuan yesterday. Sheng Huo imitation power-loom cloth for upper garments was priced at 275,000 yuan. Luo spun fabrics saw stable prices due to a lack of demand.

### Flourishing Yarn Market

Yesterday's cotton yarn market remained strong despite the China Textile Construction Corporation's yarn offering. This was due to frequent demand from local dyeing and weaving factories, active purchasing by Hankou dealers, and the participation of external speculative capital. As a result, 20-count yarn reached a new peak, with Special Double Horse yarn priced at 9,400,000 yuan and Double Horse yarn at 8,470,000 yuan, an increase of 300,000-500,000 yuan from the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn also saw a substantial increase of 750,000 yuan. Prices for 32-count, 20-count, and 16-count yarns jumped by 300,000 to 700,000-800,000 yuan.

### Continued Increase in Prices of Yarn and Cloth

The cotton cloth market saw a sudden reduction in quotas by the China Textile Construction Corporation, leading to speculation among various parties. Small retail investors and new buyers from the northern provinces competed to purchase goods, resulting in dwindling inventory and rising prices. Ultimately, various grades of 12-pound fine cloth rose by 15,000-16,000 to over 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Dark blue cloth, raw cloth, and Shilin cloth also increased by 20,000-40,000 yuan. Other markets for fine twill, poplin, etc., were also quite brisk.

### Worsted Mill Selling Off July Futures

The Shanghai Chinese Worsted Mill is selling tens of thousands of pounds of "Queen" brand fine worsted yarn for July delivery. The factory's asking price is 200,000 yuan per pound. Furthermore, "Fine Hero" from the Anle Mill, "Double Cat" coarse worsted from the Shanghai Worsted Mill, and "Double Sheep" coarse worsted from the Yumin Mill are all selling July futures. The factory's asking prices are: "Fine Hero" at 180,000 yuan per pound, "Double Cat" coarse worsted at 147,500 yuan, and "Double Sheep" coarse worsted at 96,500 yuan.

### Group Dividend Savings Program to be Implemented Once Approved by the Executive Yuan

[Our Report from Nanjing, 18th] The group dividend savings program is about to be implemented. The plan has been approved by the Joint Council of the Four Banks and submitted to the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Development Finance Corporation, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau for joint management. The Ministry of Finance believes that the plan can be implemented, but it does not need to be handled by the five banks, only by the China Development Finance Corporation. It is reported that the plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and will be implemented once approved. The group dividend savings program is divided into two types, A and B. Type A stipulates that every 10,000 households form a group, each household saves 100,000 yuan for a period of six months. At the end of the period, a lottery is drawn. The first-place winner receives a dividend of 10,000,000 yuan. The second-place winners (two winners) each receive a dividend of 1,000,000 yuan. The third-place winners (six winners) each receive a dividend of 500,000 yuan. The fourth-place winners (100 winners) each receive 50,000 yuan. Type B stipulates that every 10,000 households form a group, each household saves 100,000 yuan for a period of three months. At the end of the period, a lottery is drawn. The first-place winner receives a dividend of 5,000,000 yuan. The second-place winners (two winners) each receive a dividend of 2,000,000 yuan. The third-place winners (100 winners) each receive a dividend of 100,000 yuan. However, each household in Type B can be divided into two households, each saving 50,000 yuan, and the dividend is calculated at one-half. At the end of both Type A and Type B periods, the principal and interest are returned. The interest rate for Type A is 1%, and the interest rate for Type B is 0.6%.

### Sharp Increase in Intestine Casing Costs

After the decontrol of the cost of living index, many intestine casing businesses are unable to sustain themselves and have announced closures. It is reported that the current actual cost has reached over 11,500,000 yuan per barrel, while the US market price is only equivalent to 7,220,000 yuan in federal currency, resulting in a loss of over 4,300,000 yuan. The UK price is only 5,750,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of over 5,700,000 yuan. Although Switzerland can sell at over 10,900,000 yuan, the required amount is minimal and demand has been met. Therefore, the intestine casing industry is extremely bleak and unable to export.

### The US Dollar Bond Subscription Committee Announces Subscription Results; Door-to-Door Subscription Campaign Has Ended

### US Dollar Subscription Vouchers: Registered Vouchers Must Retain Seal Impressions

This year's government-issued US dollar government bonds and short-term treasury bills are divided into registered and unregistered types. For unregistered vouchers, the subscriber cannot report a loss if they are lost or destroyed. Registered subscribers must leave a seal impression. If the subscription is destroyed or lost, the subscriber must report the loss to the selling bank or firm and publish a statement in the newspaper. After three months, a replacement will be issued. The Ministry of Finance has issued a clear order to the Central Bank to comply with the above regulations. The Central Bank issued a public announcement yesterday and instructed the handling banks and firms to follow suit.

### China Textile Construction Corporation Distributes Yarn to Out-of-Town Reproduction Industries for the First Time; Allocation Temporarily Suspended for 90 Manufacturers in Shanghai

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 865 pieces, all to manufacturers. A total of 262 companies applied.

Yesterday, the company distributed yarn to out-of-town reproduction industries for the first time. Of the 865 pieces of yarn sold yesterday, out-of-town manufacturers accounted for 429 pieces. The distribution standard is based on the number of looms in operation at each factory, with appropriate discounts based on the China Textile Construction Corporation's cotton yarn supply. The distribution will take place once a month on the Wednesday of the third week. Yesterday's distribution was as follows: Changzhou 140 pieces, Wuxi 80 pieces, Changshu 65 pieces, Nanhui 50 pieces, Jiangyin 35 pieces, Ningbo 30 pieces, Suzhou 18 pieces, Songjiang 6 pieces, Jingjiang 5 pieces.

In addition, as a result of the company's recent general survey of manufacturers, of the first batch of 460 companies, about one-fifth, or 90 companies, have had their allocations temporarily suspended due to reasons such as relocation, incomplete accounting, work stoppage, and absence of responsible personnel. Once the problems are resolved, the allocations will be restored. The results of the second batch of general surveys will be announced next week.

### Strong Demand for Cigarettes

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with dealers actively replenishing their stocks. With slightly looser credit conditions, there were few resales in the market, and demand was strong. The inadequate supply of goods led to a surge in prices. By the afternoon, the latest ten brands of British cigarettes had risen by 140,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 6,480,000 yuan. Old Dao cigarettes also rose by 160,000 yuan, Five Flowers Hardman rose by 70,000-80,000 yuan, and other Chinese cigarettes also saw slight gains. Throughout the day, the American six-stick cigarettes and gift packages were actively selling, with retail dealers seeking each pack at a price increase of 1,500 yuan. The prices of Morris, Camel, and other brands increased by 400-500 yuan. There were many transactions for canned cigarettes, and the listed price rose to 52,000 yuan.

### Continued Relaxation in Sugar Market

Yesterday's sugar market saw continued stagnation and a downward trend due to sluggish sales. The association's listed prices were: Peruvian sugar 546,000 to 544,000 yuan, a small decrease of over 10,000 yuan. No. 20 Medium White Sugar 430,000 yuan, a small decrease of 15,000 yuan. Three-and-a-Half Car White Sugar 480,000 yuan, a small decrease of 10,000 yuan. Hechi Red Sugar 360,000 yuan. No. 1 Goods opened at 295,000 to 290,000 yuan, a small decrease of 10,000 yuan. Cotton Red Sugar 335,000 yuan, also a decrease of 10,000 yuan. Diaoqing Sugar 280,000 yuan, Xinghua White Sugar 435,000 to 430,000 yuan, Xinghua Red Sugar 330,000 to 315,000 yuan, all small decreases of over 10,000 yuan. Total transactions were approximately 300 pieces.

### Slight Improvement in Tea Market

Yesterday's foreign tea market saw only Loochong and Pei Feng Tea Companies still attracting inquiries, while the rest remained stagnant, resulting in limited transactions. The process changed little under these circumstances. However, domestic sales of red and green tea by local shops and Suzhou dealers remained active, strengthening market confidence. Sellers continued to raise prices. Although prices did not increase dramatically, they showed a gradual increase compared to the past, and the base price was very stable. The future outlook is predicted to be positive.

Coal Market Weak

The coal market has weakened again as factories have allocated coal and demand has subsided. White coal and coke have seen some active purchases due to cost considerations, but the market remains weak.

### Loan Handling Procedures: Discount Committee Has Decided

[Our Report] The Central Bank's Discount Committee held its 12th regular meeting at the committee's conference room at 4:00 PM on the 17th. Six cases were present, and 23 cases were approved, totaling 3,350,000,000 yuan. Furthermore, the committee has decided on the handling procedures for reviewing industrial loans, dividing them into four categories: fundamental industry, essential consumer goods, daily necessities, and secondary daily necessities.

### Modern International Historical Materials Compilation: The Origins and Tasks of the Far East Economic Conference

The United Nations held the Far East Economic Conference in Shanghai on the 16th of this month. This is the first conference held by the United Nations in China outside of the United Nations. This conference is related to the future of China's construction. Its origins and tasks are something that all sectors want to know. The materials written by the International Publishing House are recorded for the reference of the Chinese people.

At its second session last June, the United Nations Social and Economic Council, upon the proposal of the US representative, established a "Temporary Subcommittee on Economic Construction in Damaged Areas" under the Economic and Employment Committee, one of the five committees under the Council. The proposal was unanimously adopted and stipulated that the following two points should be submitted to the next Council meeting:

(1) The nature and scope of economic construction problems in European and Asian countries affected by war.

(2) Progress of construction and international cooperation measures that can effectively facilitate and accelerate the construction of these countries.

Recognizing the need to address economic construction problems by region, the Social and Economic Council authorized the subcommittee to work in two groups: one group for Europe and Africa, and one group for the Far East. The members are representatives from China, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia (Abyssinia), Greece, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Poland, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Yugoslavia. The French representative serves as the chairman, the Chinese representative as the vice-chairman, and the US representative as the reporter. The European group convened a meeting in London last July and established four field working teams to conduct regional investigations. The investigations have been completed, and a report has been submitted, recommending that the Council should establish a European Economic Commission. The Far East group was left to be considered after the Council's third meeting.

### The Process of Establishing the Far East Group

On October 3rd last year, the Council continued to pass a resolution, requesting the United Nations Secretary-General to prepare background materials on the war damage and construction needs of various countries in Asia and the Far East, and to arrange for preliminary investigations in the relevant regions. This investigation was undertaken by the Asia and Far East Group. (The group had already met on August 9th).

The group originally planned to meet in Nanjing to study the materials prepared by the Secretariat and information obtained from preliminary field investigations and from various governments. It was also supposed to prepare a preliminary report for submission to the Council. However, due to the busy work of the Secretariat during the United Nations General Assembly, preliminary preparations for the meeting in Nanjing could not be made. Therefore, it was agreed to hold the meeting in New York in February this year in order to prepare the report.

At its 55th plenary meeting last December, the United Nations General Assembly recognized the urgent need for international cooperation in damaged areas and recommended that "in order to provide effective assistance to countries affected by war, the Social and Economic Council should give prompt and favorable consideration at its next meeting to the establishment of a European Economic Commission and an Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East."

The Asia and Far East Working Group met on February 14th this year for its second meeting. The first half of the meeting involved a broad discussion of the preliminary factual materials provided by the Secretariat, followed by a division into two subgroups: one group to review and supplement factual materials on war damage and construction progress in various countries, and the other group to conduct general analysis in order to make specific recommendations. The reports of the two subgroups were then combined into a general report, which was approved by the working group on March 7th and submitted to the Council.

### Economic Conditions of Asian Countries

China

Nine million people died in action during the war, and the number of those who died from injuries or diseases was also extremely large. The number of people who died of starvation last year was quite alarming. Ninety percent of the machinery and light metal industry's productivity was destroyed in the war, as well as seventy percent of the coal, electricity, and steel industry's productivity, fifty-eight percent of the cotton textile industry, eighty percent of the wartime shipping industry, and sixty-five percent of the highways. The Shanghai cost of living index in November 1946 was more than 5,300 times higher than in 1937 (according to this May, it was 23,500 times higher).

Restoring the transportation system must precede everything else in China's economic construction. Cotton and textile machinery are also extremely needed in order to provide clothing for the people. Coal mines and electricity are urgently needed to help restore other industries. China's educational needs, such as university libraries, testing instruments, and trained technical personnel, all depend on foreign sources. Agricultural needs include fertilizers and cattle breeds. Medical supplies have been supplied in large quantities by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and U.S. surplus materials, but medical schools and hospitals are still in urgent need of medical supplies and equipment.

Vietnam

During the period of occupation, the country suffered severe war damage as a result of the war, enemy plunder, and the financial burden imposed by the occupying regime and military operations. The most important thing in the Viet Minh's economic construction is to provide the people with cotton cloth, restore transportation, and provide tools and electrical machinery. The Japanese in

Malaya

Massacred 100,000 people, so Malaya's greatest war loss was manpower. The Malays who survived the war suffered greatly from malnutrition and lack of medical treatment. The most urgent needs now are rice and clothing textiles. The long-term economic construction of Malaya must restore the rubber and tin industries. Singapore's special needs include food, clothing, housing, and harbor construction.

Siam

Because other Asian countries have a particularly strong demand for its exports, especially rice, its current economic situation is still good, but it is in great need of textiles and consumer goods, railway equipment, automobile transportation, and port facilities, because it was heavily bombed by the Allied forces during the war.

Hong Kong

The main obstacle to recovery is the shortage of rice and the inability to obtain consumer goods and raw materials at world prices.

Papua and New Guinea

Became a dramatic battlefield in the Pacific War. By the end of the war, all the houses had been destroyed, and the small boats connecting the islands had also been damaged. The entire economy must be rebuilt. The Australian government is responsible for building the economic life of New Guinea and Papua, and has announced that this construction will be part of a long-term plan to develop the region and improve the lives of its residents. 1946

Philippines

The national income was only two-thirds of what it was before the war, based on stable prices. Although the production of major food crops has gradually expanded, it is still necessary to import rice and other food crops. The reconstruction work has been delayed by the lack of clothing, medicine, livestock, fishing and agricultural equipment, and logging saw machines. The long-term economic construction of the Philippines requires the restoration of industries for export, which were originally the main source of income before the war. Industrial equipment is necessary to restore mining, the cigarette industry, fiber stripping, sugar extraction, oil extraction, and other industries. Assistance must also be provided in the areas of transportation, communications, housing, and education.

North Borneo

The major cities were heavily damaged by the war. In addition to houses, British Borneo is also in urgent need of rice and clothing. The people there sometimes have to use tree bark as clothing.

Burma

After its recovery, its economic life was completely disrupted and its industries were at a standstill. Because it was difficult to obtain the necessary raw materials and there was a lack of funds, the recovery work progressed very slowly. The disruption of the transportation system is the biggest obstacle to recovery. It will take five years for the important hardwood industry to recover, and the oil refineries have been completely destroyed. There will be no significant output until new equipment is reinstalled. The rice acreage before the war was 12 million acres, and half of it is now wasteland. It will take three or four years to restore cultivation.

Dutch East Indies

The "scorched earth policy" destroyed important industries such as oil, tin, navigation, and ports; rubber, tea, and coffee were all destroyed by the enemy and replaced with food crops. The transportation system and factories suffered severe damage. On the island of Java alone, it is estimated that about three million people were killed by the Japanese and died from hunger, disease, and lack of medical care. About one million on the outer islands combined.

### China Water Conservancy: The First Canal - 15th Anniversary of the Revival of the Jinghui Canal

— Special Correspondent Li Chi, Xi'an, 15th (By Air)

Living in the restless and worried ancient city, I often think of the vast sea and the trickling streams. Water is the same, but several irrigation projects in Shaanxi Province are the lifelines in the minds of the farmers who live on yellow soil.

Glorious History

According to China's water conservancy literature, Shaanxi Province can be said to have the earliest water conservancy projects. Da Yu (although historians have not determined whether he existed) who was commemorated on Engineer's Day last Saturday, June 6th, struck Longmen and controlled the waters, all of which were done in Shaanxi. Later, there were records of Qin Dynasty leading water to irrigate fields and washing away alkaline soil to grow crops. Among them, the use of the Jing River was probably the earliest. As early as 240 BC, the Qin people used Han to build the Zheng Guo Canal to open the Jing River, and led the waters of Ye, Qing, Qi, and Ju into the Luo River, irrigating 45,000 hectares of land, called the "Zheng Guo Canal." This glorious early record also has an important place in the history of world water conservancy projects.

Digging a canal is difficult, but maintaining a canal is also not easy. The Zheng Guo Canal in the Qin Dynasty was gradually destroyed in the Han Dynasty due to water banks, and the river water was not completely diverted into the canal, and water conservancy declined day by day. In the second year of the Taishi period of the Han Dynasty, Zhao Zhongdafu Bai Gong rebuilt it and renamed it "Zheng Bai Canal." Later dynasties made revisions, such as the "Fengli Canal" in the Song Dynasty, the "Wang Yushi Canal" in the Yuan Dynasty, the "Guanghui Canal" in the Ming Dynasty, and the "Longdong Canal" in the Qing Dynasty. The names were changed, but in fact they were still partially using the "Zheng Bai Canal," but the number of irrigated acres varied. By the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, it was unfortunately silted up to the point where it could only irrigate 200 acres.

Prelude to Revival

The proposal to revive the Jing River water conservancy dates back to the great drought north of the Wei River in the ninth year of the Republic of China. At that time, local gentry wanted to use the remaining disaster relief funds to repeat the old view of the "Zheng Bai Canal." In the eleventh year, the modern "Da Yu" Yi Sheshi took office as the Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau and actively carried it out, but it was ultimately blocked by the war. It was not until after the great famine in Shaanxi from the 17th to the 19th years of the Republic of China that work began. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, when the Shaanxi Bureau stabilized, Li once again presided over the province's water conservancy administration. He successively obtained the assistance of the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission, Zhu Ziqiao, and Yu Youren. The first phase of the project from the 19th year to the summer of the 21st year of the Republic of China completed three main canals and completed the organization of existing branch canals. A grand naming and water release ceremony was held on June 20 of the same year, exactly fifteen years ago today. It is a pity that Li Yishe could not see the joy of the villagers along the canal with his own eyes. He lies quietly in the cemetery on the north bank of the North Main Canal, with the splashing water as his eternal companion! Without him, there would be no revival of the Jinghui Canal, and the Zheng Guo Canal more than 2,000 years ago would still be a historical relic.

This spring, Dr. Savanji came to Shaanxi to visit the Jinghui Canal and visited Li's tomb on the way. This devotee who had fought against the heavens and the earth for water all his life also lowered his head and wrote words of admiration.

From the 22nd to the 24th year of the Republic of China, the second phase of the project was continued, and the Jinghui Canal Administration Bureau was established, directly under the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, until noon.

Irrigation Area

The Jinghui Canal still occupies the position of "oldest brother" in Shaanxi's water conservancy projects. It is not only the oldest, but also has the widest irrigation area. The total irrigation area of the nine water canals that have been released in Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi is about 2 million mu, of which the Jinghui Canal area accounts for two-fifths, that is, 820,000 mu (1946 statistics). The area covers parts of Sanyuan, Jingyang, Gaoling and Liquan, Lintong. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, the irrigation area of this canal once reached a maximum record of 950,000 mu. The entire canal is divided into north and south main lines, and then divided into eight branch canals. The water flow direction is from west to east.

Production Statistics

It is not easy to see the benefits of this canal to the agricultural crops in the area from the statistical figures of the irrigation area alone. Here we may as well cite the statistics of last year: the planting area of wheat irrigated by this canal was 340,000 mu, with an output of 440,000 shi; the planting area of miscellaneous grains (ie, corn, soybeans and others) was 140,000 mu, with an output of 170,000 shi, for a total of 610,000 shi of food. The planting area of cotton was 300,000 mu, with an output of 200,000 dan. By the way: last year's statistics were affected by other factors, and the harvest was not ideal. The highest record of crops in the Jinghui Canal area in the past 15 years was in the 28th year of the Republic of China, with a food harvest of 1.1 million shi, which is almost double last year's figure; another 280,000 dan of cotton, which is 40% higher than last year. As for the increase in yield per unit area, according to the general statistics of this province: the increase in cotton planting after canal irrigation is 100% (dry land yields about 30 jin of cotton per mu, while the irrigated area of the water canal yields 60 jin), and the increase in wheat planting is 60% (that is, dry land yields 1 shi of wheat per mu, while the irrigated area of the water canal yields 1 shi and 6 dou).

Maintaining a Canal is Not Easy

Digging a canal is difficult, but maintaining a canal is also not easy. The vicissitudes of the Jing River water conservancy for more than 2,000 years are excellent proof. From a positive point of view, developing new canals is certainly important, but from a negative point of view, how to ensure that the irrigation area continues to maintain a high quantity, so that the channels are not blocked and the water flow is reduced, is equally difficult. Before the 34th year of the Republic of China, the management expenses and staff food of the canals in Shaanxi Province were all borne by the national treasury, but since last year, except for very few subsidies, almost all of them have been raised by the local area. Under this circumstance, the provincial government had to use "using the canal to support the canal" to maintain it. In other words, the expenses for repairing and managing the canal should be borne equally by the farmers in the benefited fields along the canal. In the provincial assembly last month, someone criticized that the "small water fee" has increased the burden on farmers.

On the one hand, planning the supply and continued supply of water, and on the other hand, considering how to reduce the burden on rural farmers to the minimum extent, should be a theme of the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Conference held in Xi'an on the 25th of this month, not just the Jinghui Canal alone.

### Lamartine's Autobiographical Novel

— Shi Jimei

Book Title: Graziella Author: Lamartine (French) Translator: Lu Publisher: Cultural Life Publishing House

An eighteen-year-old youth leaves France and travels to the warm and lovely South. Later, he arrives in Naples, Italy, and resides there for several months. It is early summer, and Mount Vesuvius, Castellammare fountains, and the azure sea, blue sky, and white clouds along the Bay of Naples bring this precocious French youth many melancholy smiles and smiling melancholy. He and a friend who is two years older spend their days in a boat, beside the sail, under the sky, and on the sea, mixing reality and fantasy, spending splendid and warm nights and long days, enjoying the wonders of nature.

They meet a fisherman from Procida, an old man named Andrea and his twelve-year-old grandson, Beppino, who own a colorful little boat with a small statue of Saint Francis embedded in the stern. The two young men often ask Andrea to let them be apprentice oarsmen on the boat. Bay after bay, reef after reef, time flows in the sound of the sea waves, flowing, flowing... September begins with thunder and rain.

That time, the sea became unsettled, and the fragile boat struggled against the violent waves, the lives of the four people struggling between life and death. In the end, they had to throw everything in the cabin into the sea: water bottles, fish baskets, sails, anchors, ropes, clothing bags, and luggage were all sacrificed, but they finally reached the cliffs of Procida safely. Because the wind was strong that night, the boat was also damaged.

In a small house near the shore of the island lived Andrea's wife, their granddaughter—Graziella, who was the little sailor Beppino's sister, and two younger children, his brothers.

One evening, Graziella listened to the younger of the two youths tell the story of "Paul and Virginia." This simple girl was moved and found herself in the soul of Virginia. When the story was finished, the dying lamp went out unnoticed, and she shed many tears of emotion. Was this the first time she knew sorrow? The first time she knew love?

After a few good days, they all left Procida. Andrea's whole family moved to Mezzogiorno and would not return until winter. The two young men also returned to their residence in Naples. —At this time, the elder one had returned to France because his sister had been betrothed, leaving only the eighteen-year-old, alone in Naples. Why didn't he return home with his friend? Was it the life at sea, the fisherman's hut, and the image of Graziella that captivated him?

Eventually, he fell ill, haggard and pale, with an unnamed melancholy. Graziella heard the news and rushed from Mezzogiorno to take care of him with heartfelt devotion and lent him a small silver icon. The next day, he woke up and was cured. Ignoring his weak body, he took a carriage to Mezzogiorno. Andrea's family welcomed him warmly and invited him to stay again.

From late autumn to early winter, the sky in Naples was so clear and beautiful, Graziella's skills and appearance became more and more outstanding, and his heart felt such sweet rest and peaceful sweetness. But he never admitted, or even thought, that he had fallen in love with this beautiful island girl. She was a lovely companion, a good friend, like a close sister; he never thought of anything else. Until one day, on the eve of Christmas, Ciauzo's father came to ask for her hand in marriage for his son. Andrea and his wife were happy for their granddaughter's happy future, but Graziella was unhappy. At first, they thought it was just a girl's shyness and that she would calm down after a while. The French youth staying there suddenly realized in a moment that his feelings for Graziella were not pure and frank friendship, but strong love. His heart was agitated, his spirit was uneasy, his whole heart trembled, he was sleepless all night, and like a fool, he left Andrea's thatched cottage. After New Year's Day, he went to Mezzogiorno again and found that everything had changed greatly. Graziella cried all day, did not work, and locked herself in the house, not seeing anyone. Ciauzo's father was waiting for a reply every day, but she was unwilling, unwilling. Finally, that evening, she was overwhelmed by her grandparents' request and Ciauzo's tears and accepted her cousin's ring. That evening, he returned, heard the news, and felt a chill. He walked and talked in front of her door, but she was still silent, speechless, and invisible. He had no choice but to go to sleep as well.

There was a storm that night, but the early morning was a clear and bright winter morning. Graziella was gone, leaving her clothes and money for her family; her small silver icon and a pomegranate flower she had worn for the French youth; the ring was returned to her cousin; and a note saying that she would rather be a nun than agree to the marriage.

Ciauzo relented, and the family only hoped for her return, mentioning nothing else, so scouts were sent out to search, search. Finally, in the old house in Procida, the French youth found Graziella, who had been deformed by passion. After this poor girl gradually regained her vitality, the veil of her soul was lifted, and she finally told him "she loved him"!

Graziella was more beautiful than before, but her long eyelashes hid sorrow in her big eyes. Love can make people beautiful, but it can also make people melancholy. She understood that their paradise was built in the clouds. How could a girl from a Neapolitan island and a wealthy French youth be together forever!

On a night at the end of May, his mother asked someone to hire horses and urged him to leave immediately, allowing no hesitation. On the moonlit terrace, Graziella fainted. It was a difficult farewell, also a permanent farewell.

Back in France, he initially received letters from her, but later she fell ill and gradually there was no news. He missed her all the time, but after all, he was too young, at the age of infidelity. For fear of vicious ridicule and vain irony, he abandoned this sacred love in the sand. Winter came, and he did not fulfill his promise to go to Naples, although he never forgot Graziella. On a night in early December, he received a note brought by an unknown traveler. —Graziella is dead?

This is the story of Graziella, and also Lamartine's first love. Lamartine was a French writer of the nineteenth century. Graziella is said to have been a real person, but not the Coral Girl, but a female worker in a cigarette factory in Naples. Lamartine traveled to Italy in 1811. He had several romances in his life and married an English girl in 1819, with great happiness. But the image of the poor Graziella could never be forgotten in his memory. The first seeds are the hardest to pull out. One evening in 1830, in a church in Paris, he saw a coffin containing a young girl being carried in, covered with a white cloth. He thought of Graziella, shed tears, and unfolded the memories written in long accumulations, writing a long poem "First Mourning" to confess his infidelity and ruthlessness at the age of eighteen.

"Graziella" may not be a masterpiece in French literature, but we cannot deny that in the author's memory, it is like a light on a lone boat in the dark night, becoming brighter and brighter in the distant places where no one lives. Everyone's first sorrow will be the most beautiful and precious bud in their own garden of emotions. Romain Rolland once said: "...That is something that the torrent of life cannot wash away. In the bottom of everyone's heart, there is a tomb where loved ones are buried. They sleep in it for years and years, and nothing disturbs them. But one day—we know—the cellar will reopen. The dead will come out of the tomb, and faded lips will smile sweetly at their lovers; their past is hidden in their lovers' hearts, like a child lying in the belly of the sea..." It was on this day that Lamartine's tomb was opened when the story of "Graziella" was written.

Who has seen an old woman with white hair, how she quietly opens the dusty treasure box in her lonely room? Inside, there are many pearl, jade, and amber ornaments locked away, as well as those invisible youth and years of yesterday. Just like the old woman's treasure box, this book also locks away many confessions, happiness, memories, and many smiles and many tears.

### Reading Franklin's Biography

— Ai Wen

Book Title: Benjamin Franklin

Author: Carl Van Doren

Publisher: Overseas Editions, Inc, New York

As a child, I read about Franklin's life in the national language textbook, and I already had an impression of this great man in my mind. In middle school, I also read his autobiography (Franklin's Autobiography), and I was very amazed by his hard work and self-improvement. Unfortunately, the book was incomplete, and his achievements in society and science were not described in detail, which I deeply regretted. Today, after reading Doren's biography of Franklin, I feel relieved.

"Another ship arrived from London with news of Franklin's arrival nine days later. Philadelphia waited in constant turmoil... The bell rang as he stepped onto the street... More than a week of continuous ceremonies to welcome him. The people gave him little time to rest..." (page 464). How great was Franklin, who handled diplomacy in France, assisted in the revolution, and returned home triumphantly, stepping on his homeland ravaged by the British!

How Franklin reached this position is what we want to read on; from an apprentice in a small printing shop to a newspaper manager, to a postmaster, to an ambassador, and finally to a chief executive. On the other hand, he only studied for two years and became a scholar, scientist, writer, philosopher, and politician known throughout the world. During this period, he experienced many changes in the world, but he remained steadfast and not abandoned by the trend, with opinions and insights. He did not take a wrong step. This is not accidental or lucky; it is the result of a consistent combination of superb cultivation and practical action. His autobiography tells us how he tempered himself, and Dow's book tells us how he applied it. Especially on the eve of supporting the revolution (pages 275-333).

Franklin's life is a great history, as Dow said on the last page of the book: "...Franklin was not like those who were guilty of becoming great opportunities. In any year, in any place, Franklin would have become a great man. Thought and will, talent and skill, strength and quiet, wisdom and elegance gathered in him as if nature had indulged but liked his creation. Nothing seemed to be missing except the passionate desire, like some of the smartest people; all rulers, soldiers, saints, poets, scholars, and those with a talent or advantage or success. Franklin was from beginning to end in a docile balance..."

Dow's work is an epic of "history." His achievements do not need my eloquent explanation. The book won the American Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1939. The writing is concise and vivid, and although it is complicated, it is not annoying. The material is extensive, and there are many citations; as the introduction on the cover of the book says: "It is commendable that Mr. Doron has continued this work. Many materials have not been discovered by the public, and many known ones have been simplified and given a new analysis on the most reliable side. In truth, Franklin's autobiography is completed here and now at his own level and in his own words. ——" The only regret is that the book lacks a literary atmosphere, but this is not enough to be a problem and does not detract from its value.

At this moment, I think that young people, young people, and even old people have an obligation to read this book. Especially those who are younger, because this book can guide you in everything in your life, knowledge path, and moral training.

### Geography of Taiwan

— Zhen Fan

Author: Song Jiatai Publisher: Zhengzhong Bookstore

Victory is almost two years away: However, there are not many books published on the subject of Taiwan, and there are even fewer with achievements. In terms of the geography of Taiwan, the ones issued in the market are either pamphlets or parts of guides. Only Zhengzhong Bookstore has published a special book with in-depth and unique insights, "Geography of Taiwan" by Song Jiatai.

The content of the book is limited to the island of Taiwan and nearby islands such as Ryukyu and Penghu, and is divided into eleven chapters. The first chapter is an overview, describing the geographical characteristics of Taiwan: such as the narrow and long shape, the location of the land and islands, the mountainous terrain, the straight coastline, the tropical climate, the abundant products, the prosperous population, and the developed transportation. The second chapter is about topography and structure, describing mountains and their structure, plains and rivers, and coastlines. The third chapter is about climate and plants, describing Taiwan's temperature, rainfall, air pressure and wind, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, alpine climate, and natural plants. The fourth chapter is about agriculture (with aquaculture). The content of this chapter is the best, because agricultural economy is the economic foundation of Taiwan, so the information about agriculture and agricultural products is as detailed as possible, such as the number of cultivated land areas, the number of farm households, and the agricultural population over the years, as well as the cultivation area and yield of rice, sugarcane, sweet potatoes, tea, etc., which are all data for our research on Taiwan's agriculture. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth chapters are divided into forest products, mineral products, industry, transportation, trade, and residents. The eleventh chapter is about cities, detailing the distribution of cities and Taiwan's nine major cities—Taipei, Kaohsiung, Tainan, Keelung, Chiayi, Taichung, Hsinchu, Changhua, and Pingtung. It also includes the Penghu Islands and other islands, such as Ryukyu, Hongtouyu, Huoshaodao, Xiaohongtouyu, and Guishan Island.

The book has a total of 172 pages, and the collection of charts and tables is abundant. Among them, the east-west cross-section map of Taiwan's topography, geological map, temperature map, rainfall map, climate element map, industrial structure map, agriculture, forestry, and expansion resource map, and population distribution map are especially difficult to see.

Taiwan is the largest island in my country's coast, connected to the Ryukyu Islands in the north, facing the Pacific Ocean in the east, and facing Luzon Island across the Bashi Channel in the south. It has both the advantages of the mainland and the ocean, and its location can be said to be superior. During the 50 years of Japanese occupation, it actively built mines, cities were lined up, and railways were densely distributed, making it leap into a wealthy and prosperous area, which the Japanese regarded as a treasure trove. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, Taiwan, which has been ravaged by Japan for 50 years, has returned to the embrace of the motherland, which is so important to my country's political and economic future. Without considering my own triviality, I will introduce a relatively complete geography book, which may not be controversial to the public.

### Basic Issues of Literature and Art

— Na Ya

(Written by Donick, translated by Ji Minzhi, published by Wenguang Bookstore)

"Great art first requires artists to have lofty and great ideals and personalities, and requires them to have the spirit of hard struggle."

This sentence is correct. No matter what kind of art, it will never succeed without the "spirit of hard struggle."

Regarding literature and art, this is what most intellectual youths are paying attention to at the moment, but many youths do not have a clear understanding of the basic issues of literature and art, and only have a vague understanding of a little bit. Some people often read literary works, but they cannot avoid this kind of vague phenomenon regarding the basic issues of literature and art.

In this small book, it will eliminate this vague concept of young people.

In this book, the basic issues of literature and art are described separately as follows:

1. Aesthetics and the objects it studies. It explains that the task of aesthetics is to study the essence of art as a reflection of human understanding, its general laws of development, the treasure house of everything interconnected in nature and society, all kinds of human activities, and the creative reproduction in the images of human emotions, thoughts, etc.

Furthermore, it talks about the sociality and historicity of aesthetics: it not only lies in determining the relationship between works of art and certain social forms, but also clarifies the objective artistic significance of these works. In the process of the historical development of society and the historical development of people's productive activities, not only did artistic perceptions change, but art itself, the real artistic feelings, and the understanding of basic aesthetic categories also changed.

2. Artistic Characteristics and Content: It explains that art itself includes four basic interacting mechanisms: (1) the unity of typicality and individuality; (2) the unity of form and content; (3) the characteristics of artistic concreteness; (4) the characteristics of artistic fantasy.

Secondly, it talks about beauty in art: art and any kind of artistic activity are themselves "according to the laws of beauty"; thereby explaining in detail this "law of beauty."

3. What is sublimation? Seeking to achieve the realm of sublimation through the opposition between the ugly forms of expression and the inner beauty and goodness of the spiritual life hidden behind the forms of expression.

4. Tragedy: The inevitable conflict of the worldwide historical forces that are engaged in struggle and inevitably tend to destruction constitutes the basis of tragedy.

5. Comedy: It is an artistic depiction of comedy in reality.

Finally, this book explains the people's nature of literature and art and the new realism.

Looking at these contents, it does make a clear and definite answer to the basic issues of literature and art. Young people who love literature and art and want to understand these issues may wish to read this book.

### Supernatural Senses in Nature

— Guo Yongnian

Although humans are naturally endowed with various perceptual advantages, many sensory sensitivities are still inferior to the superior skills possessed by animals. For example, in terms of the sense of "time": If you haven't looked at a clock for several hours, try to guess what time it is? Then check with the clock's accurate time, did you guess wrong by half an hour? Or a quarter of an hour? On this point, a small bee is much better than us. British scientists have done such precise experiments: providing food to bees flying from a distance at a fixed time every day, and these bees never miss the arrival time by more than five minutes! This makes us people with clocks a little ashamed. For another example, when drinking coffee, put in a spoonful of sugar. If you put too little, you won't feel the sweetness. According to experiments, the degree to which we humans feel sweetness is one in two hundred (that is, at least one part of sugar needs to be mixed into two hundred parts of the same amount of liquid to feel its sweetness). However, flies can feel one part of sugar in 40,000 parts; but bees can detect the sweetness of one part of sugar in 300,000 parts.

For another example, in terms of changes in ambient temperature, at least the thermometer needs to go up and down several degrees before humans can feel it, which is much more sensitive and sharp in wild animals. Scientists at the American Museum of Natural Sciences placed two light bulbs of the same shape but different degrees of ripeness in front of a rattlesnake. Each time the temperature of the two bulbs was changed, the rattlesnake always pounced on the light bulb with the higher temperature. Each time the temperature difference was reduced, and finally the two bulbs differed by less than two-tenths of a degree Celsius, the snake could still detect it.

For example, in terms of hearing, animal psychologists have tested ordinary dogs and found that they can hear the ticking of a watch placed forty feet away, but the person with the sharpest hearing can hardly hear it four feet away. Ornithologists have found that when robins are jumping on the grass, they often tilt their heads and to the ground to listen for the movement of earthworms underground in order to find food.

In other cases, such as the central line on the side of fish, which can feel the pressure of water; the reason why bees can fly back and forth quickly in flower bushes at a high speed is by relying on ultraviolet rays that are invisible to the human eye to guide them; the loach can quickly swim upstream in the dark without accidentally hitting rocks; even the smallest snail, if its eyeballs are cut off, it can still feel the light or shadows passing over its body.

### Standards of Election – A Story of the Kazakhs, Part Two

— Pu Yuan

Zheng Fanggu, the leader of the Qinghai Children’s Theatre Troupe, who Chairman Ma sent to accompany us, not only loves Kazakh folk songs, but also adapts many stories of the War of Resistance against Japan. He incorporates many Uyghur, Tibetan, and Kazakh songs, and presents them in performances by his Qinghai Children’s Theatre Troupe, giving everyone who has seen these small operas a good impression of the minority compatriots on the frontier.

We often see some Kazakhs in Xining City and find their manner of puffing out their chests, sticking out their buttocks, and walking with clumsy, waddling steps to be quite foolish. But, according to Mr. Zheng, this posture precisely proves that they are accustomed to life on horseback. "Once they are on horseback," Mr. Zheng said, "their spirits immediately revive, and they truly embody the heroes we imagine."

Generally speaking, they are good and kind, but in desperate situations, they can become very cruel. "There was such a case," Mr. Zheng said, "three close Kazakh friends were walking together, and they became incredibly hungry on the road, unable to find anything to eat. So, the other two conspired and ate the third person. Later, the remaining two gave one of their friends to eat – don't laugh, this is true, they originally ate raw meat!"

"They have a custom," Mr. Zheng said, "the Kazakhs who remain within Chinese territory are also divided into many small tribes, hidden in the mountains. However, each small tribe has a leader, and this leader is elected. Perhaps it is an elderly, middle-aged, or young person. The standard for election depends on the number of bird feathers on each person's hat. The one with the most feathers is elected, and these feathers are signs of killing; each time a person is killed, a feather is added!"

In the Northwest, the fastest running animal among wild beasts is the gazelle, and the Kazakhs on horseback can easily catch up with them, whether on the plains, in the grasslands, in the desert, or in the mountains, and capture them. Their livelihood comes from hunting. In recent years, they mostly live by robbery. "Aren't traveling merchants in the Northwest accustomed to walking in large groups?" Mr. Zheng said, "The main reason is still fear of the Kazakhs; they will rob as soon as they encounter resistance."

### The Riddle of Salted Eggs

— Ning Po

Mr. Mills, an American professor at a certain university in the old capital, loves to eat Chinese salted duck eggs. He once told a joke: "Once upon a time, an American who had just arrived in China was very fond of the taste of Chinese salted eggs. At the time, he was very suspicious of how the eggs were salted. He carefully examined the eggshell, which was intact and unbroken. How could the salt enter? How could the taste be salty? He kept this question to himself, unable to find an answer, and remained silent, waiting. One day, he was invited to a banquet by a Chinese friend, and the cook brought in a whole salted duck. He suddenly understood and said: 'So there are salted ducks in China. No wonder they lay salted eggs!'"

Screen Chat

### "The Lost Weekend"

— Li Zhen

"The Lost Weekend" was the champion of the top ten films of 1946. Ray Milland won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in this film. This novel has been a bestseller in the United States in recent years, perhaps because such a popular novel was adapted for the screen.

This story is very simple, depicting a young man engaged in writing who, due to many difficulties in his career, indulges in drunkenness all day long, throwing all his time and money into bars, and finally reaching the brink of ruin, about to fall into an irreparable situation. Later, thanks to the repeated encouragement of his lover, he realized his future and broke away from alcohol.

Perhaps due to different national characteristics, prohibition in the West is a serious matter, and riots have occurred because of it. In our country, alcohol does not seem to be a serious matter. Therefore, "The Lost Weekend" can win the championship of the top ten films in Hollywood, but in our eyes, it is not an outstanding masterpiece.

Even from the perspective of the script's content, the author did not strongly explain why the male protagonist, Don, could not develop in his career, how a young man engaged in cultural work is suppressed in a capitalist society, and how frustration leads him to a perverted life. In such a situation, the encouragement of a girlfriend based on her love is probably still not enough to completely resolve the frustration that Don feels.

— However, the author does not seem to focus on these aspects. He only aims to persuade people to do good and not waste their precious time in drunkenness. Originally, one cannot demand too much from Hollywood scripts.

It is worth mentioning Ray Milland's acting skills. He subtly and profoundly portrays the psychological process of Don, the drunkard. Several scenes, such as those in the bar with the bat hallucinations, are highly rewarding in terms of acting. Almost the entire film is his solo performance. In addition, Don's lover and the owner of the bar both performed the characters' personalities very competently.

The directing and cinematography are both above standard.

### Sympathy for Postal Rate Increases

— Hei Zi

Because of the abolition of subsidy policies, state-owned enterprises are now raising prices one after another. The government's abolition of subsidy policies this time is very reasonable. We are not opposed to subsidy policies, but if it is only a partial subsidy, especially subsidies for public utilities in certain large cities, then it is worth studying. Because using the national treasury to bear the subsidies for specific areas is equivalent to all citizens bearing the costs for a portion of the people to enjoy, which is quite inappropriate.

According to reports, postal rates will soon increase, raising them by 500 percent. We sympathize greatly with this. This is not because I, the author, can watch the price increase competition from across the river, nor is it because the post office is constantly innovating and its spirit and efficiency are commendable. Rather, it is to reduce the burden on the national treasury, which is to say, to reduce the burden on the people. Indeed, the post office is the most public enterprise, and everyone has some dealings with the post office. However, the most frequent dealings are with merchants, the same as with telegrams. They rely on these two to communicate business information, connect markets, and negotiate transactions. As for parcel delivery, the commercial sector also sends the most and the largest parcels. If they send items with low postal rates and delivery fees, and the government bears the huge difference, it is truly like asking the people to bear a large portion of the postal rates and delivery fees for merchants, which is so unreasonable. Therefore, I fully sympathize with and support the postal authorities' move to abolish subsidies and implement price increases.

Therefore, I also sympathize with the increase in telegram prices, and I also support the government's abolition of subsidies for the telecommunications bureau. I feel that this can reduce, rather than increase, the burden on the people.

### Consanguineous Marriage

— Xi Pan Shi

I often hear or witness many married couples who are related to each other by blood, and their offspring are almost always disabled or have developmental abnormalities. However, when their descendants grow up and marry others, the children they have mostly inherit the bad qualities of their parents. For example, according to Benis's survey, among thirty consanguineous marriages, their descendants totaled 3,942 people. Those with limb disabilities accounted for 28.7 percent, the deaf and mute accounted for 3.6 percent, the blind accounted for 2.1 percent, those with developmental abnormalities accounted for 2.4 percent, those with epilepsy accounted for 7.5 percent, those with scrofula accounted for 7.6 percent, those who died young accounted for 22 percent, and those who were healthy accounted for 24 percent. If this continues, their future descendants will certainly not be of good quality. To avoid this situation, in a proactive sense, men and women who are not yet married must investigate in advance whether the other party's qualities are good, and never enter into consanguineous marriages. In a passive sense, those who suffer from various diseases should be prevented from reproducing.

### The Spirit of Zuo Zongtang

— Meng Ping

Reading the history of the Qing Dynasty, in the first year of Guangxu (1877 AD), Zuo Zongtang stood alone against all opinions on the issue of the Xinjiang Hui rebellion. His memorial to the throne stated: "Reclaiming Xinjiang is to protect Mongolia; protecting Mongolia is to defend the capital. The Russians are expanding their territory day by day, stretching over ten thousand li from west to east, connected to our northern border, with only Mongolia in the middle. It is best to remove the firewood quickly and take precautions before a fire starts." He also said: "I am but a scholar, having reached the highest rank of minister. I am already sixty-five years old this year, how dare I greedily claim credit? However, since Ili has been taken by Russia (1871 – the tenth year of Tongzhi, Russia, fearing that Yaqub Beg's newly emerging forces would occupy Ili, occupied the capital of Ili, Huiyuan City, under the pretext of protecting its borders, until the Treaty of Saint Petersburg in 1881, when the issue of the return of Ili was resolved), and Yaqub Beg has also occupied Kashgar, if we ignore it, we will inevitably lose ground day by day, and the future consequences are unimaginable."

At that time, Zuo Zongtang was the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu, and the Hui rebellion in Gansu had not yet been quelled. The Qing government's military campaign in Xinjiang cost more than ten million taels of military expenses annually, and the treasury was depleted. Some people advocated abandoning the eight southern cities of Xinjiang and granting Yaqub Beg the title of a vassal prince. Moreover, Yaqub Beg had considerable political skills, having negotiated with Turkish and other Muslim countries, and signed commercial treaties with Britain and Russia. The British envoy Thomas Wade also repeatedly suggested to the Qing court that Yaqub Beg be granted the title of a vassal prince. Under these circumstances, Zuo Zongtang resolutely wished to send troops to the west and pacified all of Xinjiang in 1878. We history readers break out in a cold sweat for his risky actions, and his spirit of old age and strength truly inspires admiration in later generations.

If Zuo Zongtang had not launched the western expedition and had allowed Yaqub Beg to become a vassal, (according to historical records, Yaqub Beg's governance of the region was characterized by a complete police force, and there were almost no criminal incidents among the people), then the Xinjiang region would certainly have ceased to be ours long ago, and Qinghai, Gansu, and other places would probably have faced problems as well.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shou Ou

Upon arriving outside the station, he first inquired among the villagers living in the huts about any possible means of transportation. The result was nothing, unless he hired someone to carry Fei Fei on their back, but Fei Fei firmly refused. Finally, Lao Zhu asked an old man for directions to the nearest route to Nandan, bought a few pieces of wheat-based dry food that resembled biscuits but were not, and then resolutely set off on the gray-black dirt road in the fading twilight.

Initially, Fei Fei was very quiet, not crying or complaining of a headache. After Lao Zhu walked about five kilometers, he stopped, sat down on a large rock to rest, and took her off his back, letting her drink half of the small bottle of boiled water he had filled at the station. She said nothing and fell asleep in Lao Zhu's arms. For her sake, Lao Zhu deliberately sat for a while longer, feeling a little relieved. He took out a flashlight and six or seven butter candies that he had been hoarding from his small suitcase, but only ate one, feeling that it was not as sweet as usual, and put the rest back into the suitcase.

At this time, the short hand on his watch had passed eight o'clock. Lao Zhu looked up at the blue-gray sky with stars but no moon, and tested the temperature on Fei Fei's forehead. He really felt that he could not delay any longer. He gently woke Fei Fei, let her be carried on his back as before, and wrapped her securely with a cloth.

Fei Fei rubbed her tired eyes and reluctantly complied, but after walking a very short distance, she began to groan. Lao Zhu turned back to comfort her, but she just sobbed and kept crying of a headache. At first, Lao Zhu thought it was because the child wanted to sleep but couldn't, so she was making a fuss. But after another thirty or forty yards, his back told him that Fei Fei was not only making a fuss, she was crying, and her body was twisting violently.

Zhu Zhaonian, who had no experience in taking care of children, was at a loss. He hurriedly unbuttoned his chest buttons, loosened the cloth, and suddenly put Fei Fei down. At this time, the child's legs had no strength, and she couldn't even stand for a minute. By the time Lao Zhu turned around, she had collapsed on the ground.

"Fei Fei! Fei Fei!" Lao Zhu called out as he hurriedly hugged her. He knelt on the ground with both knees.

Fei Fei only groaned, her head and neck constantly arching backward, her eyeballs rolling upwards, as if she were about to faint. Lao Zhu tried hard to calm himself, pulled over the small suitcase that had fallen to the side, and groped for the water bottle and the small glass tube containing the only remaining piece of Da Jian Phoenix medicine.

"Fei Fei, drink water, drinking some water will make you feel better!" He used great effort to crush the pill and stuff it into Fei Fei's lips. But as soon as he poured in a mouthful of water, Fei Fei suddenly vomited, spitting out both the medicine and the water.
