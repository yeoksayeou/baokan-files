[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] President Chiang's written instruction at the Party and Youth League Joint Meeting on the 10th was a speech given to party members at a meeting in late June, a review of the current situation and important decisions. In summary, it recounted the evolution of the communist rebellion since the victory, as well as a comparison of the military strength of the enemy and our forces. The conclusion President Chiang reached in this review was that the Communists' strength lies not in military affairs, nor their advantage in politics, but in the party's organization, discipline, and propaganda. We should recognize this and improve accordingly, so that we can be assured of victory. All military, political, and economic reforms should begin with strengthening the party's organization and concentrating the party's strength. President Chiang also pointed out that the party's immediate task is to unite the party and youth league organizations to increase new strength, and hoped that party members should be responsible to the party and to the revolution, strengthen their revolutionary faith, restore the revolutionary spirit, and be responsible for the party and work hard for the party. At the same time, he encouraged them to firmly follow the path of democratic constitutionalism and complete the task of national construction.

### The Atmosphere at the Meeting Was Solemn and Harmonious, with Committees Speaking Enthusiastically, all Hoping for Active Leadership of the Masses to Eliminate the Scourge of Bandits, and the Youth Movement in Particular Cannot Be Ignored in the Future.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Party and Youth League Joint Meeting was held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:30 this morning, attended by 537 people. President Chiang himself presided. After the Secretariat reported on matters, he read President Chiang's instruction "A Review of the Current Situation and Important Decisions of Our Party." After the reading, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng stood up and reported, stating briefly: The topics of the Fourth Plenary Session and the Party and Youth League Joint Meeting have been decided by the Central Standing Committee as "How to Strengthen the Revolutionary Organization of Our Party, Reform Politics, Complete the Suppression of Rebellion and National Construction, and Carry Out the Tasks of the Late Mr. Deng." In addition to soliciting opinions from comrades of party headquarters and youth league headquarters at all levels, the Party and Youth League Unified Organization Committee has also studied the matter in detail and drafted a draft of the Party's New Construction Guidelines to serve as the basis for discussion. The Central Executive Committee of the Three Principles of the People Youth League has also drafted a draft of the Party's Transformation Guidelines. Comrades of party headquarters and youth league headquarters at all levels have also expressed many opinions on this topic. These are provided to the General Assembly together. Please express your opinions on this matter broadly, provide concrete measures, and appoint a Sorting Committee to summarize and sort them out before submitting them for discussion. At this point, there was a 20-minute break. Then, the discussion proceeded. Deng Wenyi and five others spoke in succession. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely solemn and harmonious.

Deng Wenyi expressed his opinions based on his recent impressions from inspecting bandit areas, believing that in response to the current situation of bandit suppression, the party should re-coordinate in terms of policies, methods, organization, and propaganda in order to achieve the effect of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. The people in the bandit areas have confidence in the party's policies, but believe that implementation is not thorough enough, giving the communists an opportunity to exploit. Deng also revealed the communists' conspiracy to instigate the "three strikes" policy in our rear and proposed countermeasures that we should take.

Li Jinzhang pointed out that the party's organizational training should avoid formality, focus on scientific approaches, strengthen combat focus, especially at the grassroots level, with the focus on approaching the masses and leading the masses. Party internal evaluation and supervision should also be strengthened.

Zhou Zenglin explained that although the Communist Party is very insidious and poisonous, our party has a glorious history, a broad organization, great ideals, and wise leadership. All these superior conditions are beyond the reach of the communists. As long as we cheer up and work hard, the communists are not to be feared. All reforms of the party should start with raising the supervisory power.

Tang Ruyan pointed out that the Communist Party is a highly specialized organization that violates human nature, emphasizing only party discipline and lacking emotion. This is the main reason for its failure. Therefore, he advocated that in the party's organizational program, discipline and emotion must be given equal importance, and the political program should focus on vigorous implementation. At the same time, he suggested adding phrases such as "share life and death, share weal and woe, love the party, and love comrades" to the oath.

Luo Cairong discussed the plans proposed by the Party and Youth League, emphasizing first of all the need to raise the concept of loving the party, with love for the party above all else. The party is the major artery of the country, and the Youth League is like the country's fresh blood. The two complement each other. Luo also advocated that in addition to the organization and political programs, there should be an action program. Party members holding government positions should be strictly assessed, and comrades should be mobilized to participate in battlefield work.

Zhen Tianxi, based on his experience in presiding over school youth league affairs, pointed out that the communists' instigation of student movements is professionalized and specialized, using money to lure students. However, the majority of students have a sense of justice and patriotism. He hoped that respected party and youth league elders, based on their enthusiasm for protecting young people, would personally go to various schools to lecture and guide them, so as to influence the thinking of young people into the right track. The meeting adjourned at 12:05.

The Party and Youth League Joint Meeting continued at 3:00 p.m., still presided over by President Chiang. Representatives broadly exchanged views on the "Draft of the Party's New Construction Guidelines" and the "Draft of the Party's Transformation Guidelines." The speakers and their main points are recorded below: Wang Zhiyuan reviewed the content of the plan, believing that school party affairs should be strengthened, and the glorious history of the party should be promoted. The goal of saving the country and the people with the Three Principles of the People will surely win the support of young people.

Feng Yunxian especially called the attention of the General Assembly to the border issue, strengthening the border party headquarters, and actively leading the women's movement.

Zang Jianxin expressed concern that the instability of the social economy easily causes the depression of young people. He hoped that the party's elders would actively lead, so that young people would have something to rely on.

Chen Xueping believed that the failure to mention the youth issue in the party's program was a major regret. Students and young people are dissatisfied with the status quo due to insufficient school facilities and the general inability of the society to accommodate them. We must try our best to solve some of the difficulties encountered by young people. Special care must be given to young students who have escaped from the communist areas to prevent them from being used by other parties. As for some liberal professors, we cannot immediately consider their thinking to be problematic because their remarks and criticisms are slightly more radical. We must know that their motives for criticism mostly stem from their enthusiasm for protecting the country, and this cannot be considered a crime.

Lin Yongnian advocated that in addition to the party's organization and political programs, there should be an action program. However, this must be pragmatic and self-disciplined, avoiding self-promotion. After the party and youth league are unified, this new party must have a new style when promoting party affairs in the future in order to fight against the current enemy, the communists. We should truly cooperate with the people and first gain the sympathy and belief of the people, and then we can establish the foundation of the party. Therefore, it is essential for party workers to become one with the people.

Xie Renzhao spoke, explaining that what should be paid attention to after the party and government reforms and the unification of the party and the country is how to quickly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. We must move from destruction to construction, and from non-production to production. Therefore, the party must encourage party members to engage in industrial production and complete the mission of national construction as soon as possible. As for the youth movement, it cannot be ignored in the future. He hoped that youth movement committees could be established in some areas in the near future to actively lead the youth.

Han Wenpu believed that after the unification of the party and youth league, special attention should be paid to the following tasks: (1) The people do not hope for the success of the communists, but place deep hopes on the Kuomintang. Today is our opportunity to work hard. (2) We should work hard to serve the people. (3) We should universally manage local government officials. (4) We should assist party members to develop towards agriculture and industry.

Li Manhun reviewed the contents of the two programs and believed that they both ignored the importance of ideological leadership. Therefore, he advocated: (1) Strengthening cultural work, which should be the basis of organization. (2) Absorbing progressive elements who stand on the interests of the country and the nation. We should not consider their thinking to be incorrect and lose the masses because their words are slightly radical. (3) Cultivating creative young people, setting up more scholarships, and actively helping young people pursue further education. Concentrate efforts to create several daily newspapers and periodicals to achieve propaganda effects.

At 4:15, there was a fifteen-minute break, and the meeting continued, presided over by Ju Zheng. Li Yaolin, Deng Feihuang, and others continued to express their opinions.

Li Yaolin said: In order to relieve the people's suffering and complete the mission of national construction, the unification of the party and youth league is necessary to achieve this goal. The party and youth league must understand each other and make concessions to unite forces and eliminate the communists.

Deng Feihuang pointed out that a small number of party members holding government positions have a tendency to leave the party. The central government should strictly control them and involve them in the party's organization. The party's grassroots organization is not sound and needs to be strengthened urgently. At least a few corrupt elements must be eliminated in time to thoroughly transform.

Hu Qiuyuan believed that whether the communists can be eliminated is not only related to the rise and fall of the party, but also determines the survival of the country. Regarding the current situation, Hu advocated thoroughly selecting talents, strengthening internal party management, and taking practical actions to meet the needs of the people.

Guo Zijun advocated improving the quality of grassroots working comrades within the party and determining their position in the party based on their working ability. The policy must be consistent with action, and facts must be used for external propaganda.

Lei Gu called on the General Assembly to pay attention to the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. The unrest caused by poverty today can be easily resolved as long as the party works hard to implement the teachings of the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang's instructions. He believed that the party's new construction plan drafted this time should stipulate a time limit in order to be completed as scheduled.

Ren Zhuoxuan believed that there must be a new theory before there can be new actions. He hoped that everyone would pay attention to studying the theory of the later revolution as the basis for the party's transformation. Ren also said that the party should seek development through propaganda and consolidate the party through training. The two should not be biased, but the most fundamental thing is the ideological issue. It is necessary to understand the general psychological state of party members and do the work of setting things right.

Tong Huaizheng, as a representative of peasant comrades, pointed out to the General Assembly that the foundation of the party should be built in the vast rural areas. Today's peasant masses, in the cruel massacres of the communists, are waiting for the assistance and rescue of party comrades. They believe in the Three Principles of the People and support our leader. Strengthening rural work in the future is the most effective way to combat the communists.

Cui Chuiyan advocated strengthening the party's fighting spirit, strengthening the party's grassroots organization to approach the masses, and strictly implementing the party's tasks.

Meng Shufan said: During the current period of bandit suppression, politics should cooperate with military affairs. The party should strengthen propaganda work in the communist areas to make the people understand the central government's concern for them, and strive to eliminate the scourge and carry out the task of construction.

### The Youth Party's National Congress Declaration

[Central News Agency, This City] The 11th National Congress of the Youth Party opened on the 1st of this month, lasting for nine days, and concluded successfully on the 9th. The party has just released the declaration of the National Congress, which discusses politics, military affairs, diplomacy, economics, and finance. It states briefly:

(1) In terms of politics, we recognize that the current political situation needs to be thoroughly reformed, and it is indeed possible to gradually improve it. The reason why it has become the paralyzed phenomenon of today is partly due to historical inertia and partly due to the defects of the system. Everything measured during and after the war is the main reason for the formation of this paralyzed phenomenon.

The remedy is, first, to adhere to the track of democratic constitutionalism and strive for its gradual implementation. Second, if party ethics are not established, civil morality will not be promoted. In order to establish political and natural norms, it is better to lose trust through fairness and compliance with the law than to succeed through clever plundering. Third, the use of policies is not about covering everything, but about grasping the key points. As for correcting the habit of sluggishness and perfunctoriness and stopping the wind of competition and infighting, this is especially necessary for the current political situation. Fourth, the division of powers and responsibilities between the central and local governments should be based on the provisions of the Constitution. If the central government binds the local government, the autonomy system cannot be established, and the democratic spirit cannot be popularized throughout the country. Fifth, the recruitment of talents should have a fair and generous system, while the cultivation of talents depends on awards and tempering. It is necessary to make the people use their right to vote carefully, the public opinion circles use their right to criticize carefully, political parties can work diligently to train their members, and today's largest party, the Kuomintang, must be able to base itself on fair principles, and for the central political power, especially local political power, enable other parties and non-party people to have the opportunity to participate in actual politics according to the size of their strength.

(2) In terms of military affairs, we have always advocated the nationalization of the military. To realize this principle, we must establish the purpose and system of military education, improve the quality and training of the military, ensure the fairness and universality of conscription obligations, be careful and strict in the promotion of officers, and ensure the reality and openness of military needs distribution. Especially important is the implementation of the separation of military and civilian governance and the determination of the military region system. As for the current measures to mobilize to suppress rebellion, we also recognize that to solve this problem, it is by no means effective to simply place hope on military affairs. If politics is not thoroughly reformed, there is no way to ensure the results of the war.

(3) In terms of diplomacy, our nation respects peace, and its support for the United Nations Charter is clearly stated in it. Therefore, we are willing to befriend all those who are willing to live in peace with us. However, given the closeness of today's international relations, the so-called peace must take ensuring world peace as a prerequisite. As for our reconstruction of Japan, if we can take prohibiting its restoration of arms as a basic condition, we are unwilling to make excessive demands. If its people can continue to display their good habits of diligence and frugality to engage in peaceful and democratic construction, and its economic development does not threaten the future of our country's production, we will not hesitate to restore normal relations with it.

(4) In terms of economics, we advocate that everything should be based on private operation, except for a very small number of heavy industries or transportation enterprises that are beyond the capacity of private power and have a national scope, and some matters that are directly related to national defense. The mode of official-business joint operation is a plot for corruption, and official supervision of business operation is a sin. In the future, it must be thoroughly corrected. In terms of finance, we advocate thoroughly rectifying China's finances. It must start with reforming the monetary system, take increasing production as its foundation, and then set the tax system and rectify discipline for its use. Otherwise, public bonds will be difficult to sell, foreign debts will be difficult to raise, and tax revenue will be a source of water without a source. All the winds of corruption and embezzlement will be enough to promote the collapse of the entire situation. The so-called clean politics will be empty talk, and the so-called balance of payments will become exhausted. (The End)

### Measures for Party Members' Property Registration Designated to be Submitted to the Plenary Session for Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] In order to comprehensively understand the living conditions of party members and prevent party members from engaging in corruption and other improper economic behavior, the Kuomintang has decided to conduct property registration for party members. The measures have been drafted and are generally as follows:

Party members should register when they join the party. The registration of leading cadres of the party at all levels, government officials in charge, and persons in charge of state-owned and public-owned enterprises should be particularly detailed. Registration is based on the current social and economic conditions. Party members whose daily income and expenses are sufficient to offset each other and whose property is more than 5,000 yuan before the war are considered to be able to support themselves, and so on. If there are party members who have become particularly wealthy due to past improper behavior and do not participate in property registration, party disciplinary sanctions should be strictly enforced. The measures can be implemented after being passed by the Plenary Session.

### Foreign Minister Wang Flies to New York Today to Discuss Peace Talks with Japan with Leaders of Various Countries, Arguing that the Peace Treaty Should Receive Universal Support

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 9th] Our Foreign Minister Wang Shijie is scheduled to fly to New York on the 11th and does not intend to visit Washington before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Wang said at a press conference on the 9th that one of his responsibilities in the United States will be to contact leaders of other countries directly concerned with the Japanese peace talks. He reiterated that "our goal should be a comprehensive peace treaty supported by the public." Wang made this statement in view of the Soviet Union's repeated requests to limit the work of drafting the Japanese peace treaty to the four major powers, rather than being presided over by the eleven member states of the Far Eastern Commission proposed by the United States. Foreign Minister Wang explained that the reason why the Soviet Union adopted this position was that the Soviet Union was afraid that in the meeting of eleven countries, its speech might be extremely ineffective due to the two-thirds majority vote system. As for the compensation in the peace treaty, Wang said that China does not intend to demand anything that would permanently bind Japan. At the same time, he made it clear that China, which has been at war with Japan for the longest time and suffered the most, should receive the largest share of the compensation. In response to the question of the stalemate in Dalian, Wang said that the Soviet Union believes that the war against Japan has not ended, and they still have the right to occupy the port militarily. The Chinese government believes that the war against Japan has ended long ago, and Dalian should belong to China in accordance with reason. He also said that the Soviet Union's interpretation of certain clauses in the Sino-Soviet Treaty would not be accepted by objective people. Wang warned that peace in the Far East depends on faithful adherence to the words and spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, otherwise the situation in the Far East will be very bad. Wang also discussed the Communist Party issue and the allegation by some Americans that the Chinese government made mistakes in distributing UN relief supplies. He believed that there is no possibility of peace talks between the Chinese government and the Communist Party until transportation is restored and the main force of the Communist Party is annihilated. Communism in China is the same as in other countries, if it can establish effective and powerful

### The Soviet Union Does Not Participate in the Meeting on Korea, Our Government Expresses Extreme Disappointment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists at 4:30 p.m. on the 10th, presided over by Director General [blank] himself. The Q&A is recorded below:

Q: The suggestion to hold a four-nation conference to discuss the Korean issue has been rejected by the Soviet Union. What is the Chinese government's reaction to this? Has the Chinese government received a formal note from the US government stating that this meeting will be postponed due to the Soviet Union's rejection?

A: The Chinese government feels very disappointed that the Soviet government disagrees with the US's suggestion to convene a four-nation conference. The realization of the unification of Korea is the Chinese government's consistent expectation. In April of this year, the Chinese government suggested that if the two countries occupying Korea cannot agree, the four countries that formed the agreement on Korea established in Moscow in November 1945 should be convened for consultation. For the sake of fairness to the Korean people and for the sake of political stability in the Far East, the Chinese government sincerely hopes that the four countries can still act in unison on the issue of resolving the Korean issue. Regarding the second point inquired in the question, the Chinese government has not received a formal note from the US.

Q: Has the Soviet Union replied to the Chinese government's protest against the Soviet ship "Ilyich" sailing to Shanghai carrying passengers and goods?

A: The Chinese government has not yet received a reply from the Soviet Union.

Q: Has the Chinese government instructed Foreign Minister Wang to represent China on special matters during the UN General Assembly?

A: I am sorry I cannot answer this question.

Q: If the Soviet Union opposes holding a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, does the Chinese government support holding a peace conference without the presence of the Soviet Union?

A: Regarding this point, Foreign Minister Wang made a very clear statement in Shanghai on the eve of his departure for the United States. I have no other opinions to add besides asking you to refer to that statement.

### List of Drafters of the Declaration of the Plenary Session

### Nearly 100 Billion Yuan in Profits from the Allotment and Sale of Yarn and Cloth, Half of which is Allocated to Improve Cotton Production, and 50.9 Billion Yuan is Used as a Development Fund for the Textile Industry

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs said: The total profit from the allotment and sale of yarn and cloth by the former Textile Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs last year was approximately 95.9 billion yuan. In accordance with the original regulations for stabilizing yarn prices, it should be stored in a special government account for the purpose of subsidizing cotton production and developing the textile industry. The distribution method has been decided by the 17th Executive Yuan meeting, with 45 billion yuan allocated to the Cotton Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for the improvement of cotton production. It has been ordered by the office to prepare a production plan for approval and implementation. The remaining 50.9 billion yuan will be used as a development fund for the textile industry. The plan and budget are being prepared by experts designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the "Ministry of Economic Affairs Textile Industry Development Fund Management Committee" is being organized in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan. Relevant institutions and textile industry tycoons are being appointed as members to jointly bear the responsibility of reviewing income and expenditure and investment. How this fund will be distributed and used is yet to be decided. In addition, 16 billion yuan was allocated from the 35th year profit distribution plan of China Textile Corporation as an academic research fund. The distribution method has also been approved by President Zhang, and most of it is for technical research institutions directly or indirectly related to the textile dyeing industry.

Pan Gongzhan said: Our party has led the revolution and experienced decades of struggle, and has a glorious history. We are confident that this thorough reform of our party from top to bottom, from inside to outside, will be able to exert the greatest effect. If this force is used to promote society, there will be positive development. Pan also emphasized that there are many talented people in the party, but they have not been valued by ordinary comrades, so it is not easy to exert a positive effect.

Li Jingshi pointed out that the separation of the party from the masses is a serious mistake. As long as the party actively leads, it can eliminate the communists who endanger the people.

Fan Xipin said that correcting one's own mistakes is the only way to defeat the enemy. Standing on the position of seeking benefits for the people and eliminating the communists will surely gain the trust of the people, and thus can generate power and complete the unification and construction of the country. After Fan's speech, the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting at 6:45.

### Chairman's Speech at Plenary Session Prominently Published in American Newspapers

### Zhang Zhizhong Arrives in Nanjing to Discuss Border Situation; Xinjiang Situation at a Standstill; Government Decides to Handle Issue with Peaceful Policies; Zhang to Report on Beitashan Incident at Plenary Session

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, flew from  to Nanjing at 4:40 PM on the 10th. Zhou Zhirou, Yu Jishi, Lan , and students from the Frontier School in Nanjing were among those who greeted him at the airfield. After disembarking, Zhang returned to his official residence to rest. At 7:00 PM, he was summoned to the Chairman's residence to report on the border situation. Zhang is scheduled to attend the Plenary Session within days to report on the Xinjiang issue and the Beitashan incident.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Zhang Zhizhong met with reporters at his residence at 5:00 PM on the 10th and spoke candidly about the border situation. He mentioned that the current situation in Xinjiang is at a standstill, but the government's established peaceful policy will not change. The government will not consider the other side's request to replace Mesut Sabri, as this decision is aimed at "governing with new people and new policies." Zhang also stated that he had presented four demands to the other side on the 1st of this month, which have not yet been answered. It is estimated that the three districts occupied by the other side have a population of only over 800,000 and a military force of only six regiments, totaling 12,000 men. In contrast, our side has a population of over 3 million in seven districts. From this perspective, the other side's demands are unlikely to lead to a further deterioration of the situation. We are currently awaiting their response before making a final decision. When reporters inquired about the recent situation at Beitashan, Zhang said there were only minor skirmishes. He declined to answer questions about the participation of a certain side's aircraft and the nature of the war at Beitashan.

### Minister Bai's Full Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi: This afternoon, at the first meeting of the Fourth Plenary Session, a military report was given, meticulously reviewing "Military Installations," "Implementation of Systems," and "Overview of Bandit Suppression." The full text is recorded as follows:

A. Preface

Since the communist bandits betrayed the Republic of China, they have successively violated the armistice orders issued by the government, denied the constitution formulated by the national will, exhausted military force, and harbored malicious intentions, aiming to bring the Republic of China to utter ruin. This ministry, following the orders of the Supreme Commander, continues to carry out bandit suppression and pacification, rescuing the people in the bandit-controlled areas, and simultaneously establishing a military system as a grand plan for building the army. Since the government issued the National General Mobilization Order on July 4th, the coordination between our political and military strategies has become closer, and the purpose of military actions has become clearer, allowing policies to be implemented smoothly. After the mobilization order was issued, we entered the stage of "Everything for bandit suppression, everything for victory." The entire nation rose up together, striving forward, and all political and economic measures were focused on achieving victory in bandit suppression. In the military aspect, it is even more appropriate to focus on achieving military victory and the situation of bandit suppression. The future military policy, under the premise of "Bandit Suppression First," includes: First, replenishing the personnel shortages of the front-line corps in a timely manner to maintain regular combat effectiveness; Second, establishing a second-line corps as the general reserve force of the national army, using new forces to achieve victory earlier; Third, improving local self-defense organizations and universally strengthening the organization and training of the masses to ensure military-civilian cooperation, exert comprehensive tactics, and ensure area control; Fourth, in general military and political aspects, emphasizing the establishment and implementation of a modernized military system to lay a foundation for the national army for a century and to ensure national defense security.

In summary, to adapt to the general mobilization and enable military policies to coordinate with the mobilization of all manpower and resources, we will revise plans accordingly and implement them rationally to overcome all difficulties and complete the pacification mission. I will now report on the bandit suppression efforts and related military and political measures over the past six months.

B. Regarding Military and Political Installations

Military and political installations have been . This ministry is continuously implementing them. I will briefly describe the current needs and concerns of the people as follows:

(1) Placement of Demobilized Officers: The placement of demobilized officers was previously implemented according to a predetermined plan. After the mobilization order was issued, all demobilized officers, except those already placed, who could not change careers or were strong in their prime, were retained and stored as supplementary cadres. The general (major) teams of officers have now all been concluded, and the work of placing demobilized officers has also come to an end. I will now describe the past placement situation as follows: 1. The number of demobilized officers totaled approximately 240,000 at the end of the 35th year after the national army reorganization (including approximately 160,000 surplus officers), with approximately 70,000 unemployed, who were received and trained by various officer general (major) teams. 2. The placement of demobilized officers was divided into three types: retention, career change, and retirement (discharge). The original plan was to retain 20,000, transfer 150,000, and retire 15,000. Because the number of surplus personnel increased more than expected, totaling approximately 240,000, and due to the impact of the situation, career changes were difficult. As a result, approximately 70,000 were retained, approximately 55,000 were transferred, and more than 100,000 were retired. 3. The placement of demobilized generals totaled more than 2,500, most of whom were retained, except for those who changed careers or retired. 4. The number of demobilized officers who changed careers totaled more than 50,000.

(2) Adjustment of Officer and Soldier Compensation: Officer and soldier compensation is affected by prices, making it extremely difficult to maintain livelihoods, which directly affects combat and indirectly affects public perception. Although two slight adjustments were made in February and May of this year, due to continuous price increases, officers' lives still could not be improved, and soldiers' lives were even worse. Fortunately, the government adopted measures to equalize civilian and military compensation, adjusting officer and soldier compensation starting in August, with the main points as follows: 1. Officers' base salaries are paid according to the intermediate salary level of civil officials of the same rank, such as a major general being calculated according to the fifth level of simplified appointment, and a captain being calculated according to the intermediate level of the second and third levels of delegated appointment. 2. Soldiers are calculated and increased according to the actual salary amount before the War of Resistance Against Japan, i.e., sergeants are increased by 10,000 times, superior privates by 12,000 times, and first and second class privates by 15,000 times. 3. Because military officers and soldiers are frequently transferred, they are not divided into regions for supply purposes, and compensation in all regions is calculated according to the second region standard for civil servants, i.e., a basic number of 39 million yuan and a base salary of 1,600 times, with higher amounts for the Northeast, Xinjiang, and Taiwan. 4. In the future, when civil servants' compensation is adjusted, military personnel will be adjusted simultaneously in comparison. (To be continued)

Editorial

### The Turbulent Japanese Political Situation

The Japanese political situation has been in turmoil again in recent months. The Katayama cabinet, in order to ease the opposition party's attacks in the Diet, requested the Diet to postpone its session for two weeks, from September 1st to 14th. During these two weeks, the Japanese political situation did not improve. On the one hand, opposition leader Shigeru Yoshida launched the Liberal Party's executives to travel and give speeches throughout the country, attacking the government in various ways to prepare for a no-confidence vote. On the other hand, incumbent Foreign Minister and Director-General of the Central Liaison Office Hitoshi Ashida suddenly delivered an anti-government speech on the 6th, pointing out that "the Katayama cabinet's policies have run into a wall, the current cabinet has lost the people's trust, and it is time to relinquish power." He also pointed out that Yoshida is currently preparing to form a new party, and if successful, many members of the Democratic Party will defect, and hinted that the new party's new policies are to cope with the Allied countries' peace treaty with Japan, and he is very interested in this matter. Looking at the trend, the opposition party's strength seems very strong, and the current cabinet lineup already has cracks. How Katayama will cope, and how MacArthur will nod, has become the key to the survival of the current cabinet.

The Katayama cabinet was formed on June 1st of this year. Katayama is the leader of the Socialist Party, which became the largest party in the Diet in the April election. According to the Japanese constitution, the prime minister is elected by the Diet, and Katayama won an overwhelming victory, taking over the first cabinet under the new constitution. In order to unite the parties, Katayama attempted to form a four-party coalition government, but failed due to the Liberal Party's lack of cooperation. He then changed course to win over the Democratic Party, and as a result, Ashida joined the government, barely forming a three-party coalition government. However, Katayama's administration over the past three months has relied on the "Four-Party Policy Agreement," expecting the Liberal Party's cooperation. In all fairness, Katayama himself has the breadth and magnanimity of a statesman, and has won general favorable reviews. Katayama appeared as a "progressive," and for the sake of Japan's revival, he has continuously carried out various reforms and constantly sought assistance from the United States. MacArthur has also quite encouraged Katayama's reforms, especially satisfied with the Katayama government's obedient attitude. Logically, the Katayama government should be supported by the people and the opposition parties. However, Katayama has encountered many hidden reefs, the opposition parties' strong anti-government activities, and Ashida's divisive attitude towards the government have already reached a showdown.

The opposition parties oppose the Katayama government for two reasons: First, economically, they believe that the current regime has failed to stabilize Japan's economy. Katayama's socialist-leaning reforms, such as preparing to place coal mines under state control, have been firmly opposed by the private sector. Shigeru Yoshida's Liberal Party has openly expressed opposition, causing many obstacles to Katayama's administration. Second, politically, they believe that the current regime is weak and incompetent, unable to eliminate communist forces domestically and unable to seize the opportunity for a peace treaty with Japan, allowing Japan to obtain a "victory in the peace treaty" under very favorable circumstances, and luckily obtain "equal treatment," "without losing rights or paying compensation." The Liberal Party opposes the Katayama government based on economic and political reasons, obviously to protect Japan's old forces and Japan's militarism, and intends to revive Japan's old forces. Today's Japan still relies on the old forces as its pillar, so the opposition party's activities in the opposition can receive widespread response, and even Hitoshi Ashida has opportunistically echoed them. This is the Katayama government's misfortune, and also the horizontal break of the undercurrent of Japan's conservative forces, reaching a political watershed.

The rise of Japan's conservative forces is not only a misfortune for Japan's democratic politics, but also a misfortune for Japan's future of peace and stability. The new party that Yoshida is brewing to organize is to unite the conservative stubborn forces. They are prepared to use the slogan of striving for "victory in the peace treaty" to overthrow the current government, dominate the next regime, and wait for the completion of the peace treaty before seeking the revival of Japanism. According to a report in the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun on the 4th of this month, former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, former Prime Minister Kijuro Shidehara, Privy Council President Tsuneo Matsudaira, and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Naotake Sato are forming a new party as first-class diplomats before the peace conference, and are obtaining the next regime. Looking at the situation, "new diplomat" Ashida is also infatuated with the activities of the new party. If this new party can really be formed and MacArthur nods in agreement, then the Katayama cabinet will undoubtedly collapse. Yoshida is the mastermind of the conservatives, Shidehara and Matsudaira are not only conservative, but also extremely stubborn, Sato and Ashida were schemers in Japan's war of aggression and should have been listed as war criminals and severely punished, which would not be harsh. But today's Ashida is not satisfied with celebrating his promotion, and is now speculating politically. Sato is engaged in new conspiracies, which is a threat to peace in the Far East. This situation shows that in today's Japan, there is no so-called public opinion to impose sanctions, and MacArthur's leniency and tolerance do not involve the pursuit of war responsibility. If this situation continues to evolve, the conservative forces will inevitably rise further, and Japanese politics will never be bright. Whose fault is this? We would like to hear how the United States judges this.

In short, the turbulent Japanese political situation is the result of the rise of the conservative forces, and is a necessary reflection of the radiation of reactionary forces. Japanese politics has now reached a watershed, and the life and death fate of the Katayama cabinet will be arranged by the reactionary forces and MacArthur. After the Japanese Diet reconvenes, Katayama, with his position as the largest party, should logically be able to safely overcome the difficulties and temporarily prolong his life. After the new party matures, the Katayama government has two paths to take: one is to strive for "victory in the peace treaty" and surrender to the new party; the other is to be困扰 by financial and economic problems and coerced by the reactionary forces, and hand over the regime to the conservatives. Other than that, Katayama seems to have few new paths to follow.

### Bollaert Formally Announces France's Conditions for Truce in Vietnam; Whether Viet Minh Agrees Is Still a Question; French Insist Viet Minh Must Accept or Reject in Full

[Associated Press, Saigon, 10th] France announced today to Vietnam that it would allow it full political independence and establish it as part of the French Union. This condition was announced by French High Commissioner to Vietnam Bollaert in a speech in Haiphong. Its purpose is to end the bloody war that has been going on between France and the Viet Minh Republic since last December. Bollaert recently returned to Vietnam after a lengthy meeting in Paris with French Prime Minister Ramadier and other government leaders. The main points of the conditions proposed by France to Vietnam are as follows: (1) France will hand over all domestic administrative power in Vietnam to the various states of Vietnam; (2) France requires the safety of pro-French Vietnamese to be guaranteed; (3) France and Vietnam will exchange military and political prisoners; (4) In peacetime, the various states of Vietnam will maintain domestic order with the police, but if they are subjected to foreign invasion, France is responsible for defending Vietnam, and the police forces of the various states of Vietnam should join the French army in combat; (5) The various states of Vietnam must abide by all treaties concluded between the French Union government and foreign countries. Bollaert emphasized that the conditions proposed by France should be accepted in full or rejected in full. At the same time, if these conditions are accepted, both sides should issue a ceasefire order first. Bollaert called on all Vietnamese political groups to rise up and resolve the disputes in Vietnam and jointly participate in the reconstruction of Vietnam, which has been ravaged by war. He stressed that he represents the French government in making this formal appeal, "Under the French Union structure, Vietnam will gain freedom, which will become the basis for the future relationship between the French and Vietnamese peoples. There are no other restrictions except for the fact that these territories belong to the French Union."

[United Press, Paris, 10th] A dispatch from Saigon received here today stated that French High Commissioner to Vietnam Bollaert gave a broadcast speech today, agreeing to return political power in Vietnam to the Viet Minh Republic, provided that Vietnam should still be within the French Union, and that France be allowed to retain military facilities and control Vietnam's foreign policy. The last point was opposed by Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh during the Paris conference last year.

[Central News Agency, Hanoi, 9th] The war in Vietnam is nearing its end. According to semi-official reports, the French government has decided to establish an agreement with the Ho Chi Minh government to clarify the situation in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese who withdrew from the Vietnamese military-controlled area three days ago, the general situation in the area is still good, the Vietnamese army obtains most of its military supplies through secret routes, and most Vietnamese still support Ho Chi Minh.

Vietnamese Right-Wingers Support Bao Dai

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 10th] Representatives of twenty-one right-wing Vietnamese political, social, and religious groups formally requested former Vietnamese King Bao Dai to accept Vietnamese political power and negotiate with France to restore peace in Vietnam. Most of the Vietnamese representatives arrived in Hong Kong from Saigon on the 9th, denouncing the Ho Chi Minh government for adopting totalitarian, anti-democratic, and anti-national actions that promote division and destroy Vietnam's material and culture. The representatives stressed in their petition that the Vietnamese people deeply believe that Bao Dai can fulfill the people's demands and hopes for unity and independence. The representatives include the provisional president of Cochinchina.

### UN Intervention in Indonesian Affairs; Van Mook Deeply Dissatisfied; Believes It Only Delays Resolution of Dispute

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] Dutch Governor-General Van Mook said today: I believe that the United Nations cannot provide an effective solution to the Indonesian problem, and only the Dutch "police action" is a way to eliminate unstable armed forces on the island, but the Netherlands should still wait for the six consuls in Batavia to submit their report to the United Nations before taking further action.

In view of the past handling of other disputes by the Security Council, I am not very optimistic about its ability to resolve the Indonesian problem. The UN intervention in Indonesian affairs is sufficient to delay its resolution, but it is also useful if it can ascertain the true facts. Although there is no sign of reorganization of the Indonesian government, in order to eliminate those who want to destabilize the situation there, it is necessary to reorganize the republic before it completes its independence. There are currently 93,000 Dutch troops in Indonesia, 70,000 of whom are Dutch, and the rest are islanders. After my visit to the United States, after all the efforts made by Secretary of State Marshall and Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kleffens, the United States now understands the Dutch position. Secondly, the communist forces in the Indonesian conflict cannot be ignored. As far as I know, the report to be submitted by the United Nations consular officials can only be resolved if both parties can abide by the ceasefire order, but the Indonesian side has not yet complied with the ceasefire order.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 10th] Aneta News Agency reported that Dutch Commander General Spoor has allowed the Overseas Chinese Security Team to serve as automatic auxiliary guards to protect houses, factories, and warehouses, but they are only allowed to carry weapons while on duty.

### Chinese and Belgian Consuls-General Inspect War Zone

[United Press, Batavia, 10th] Chinese Consul-General Chiang Chia-tung and Belgian Consul-General Steichen set off today for western Java and will report to the United Nations consular investigation team this weekend on the implementation of the ceasefire order in Bandung, Sukabumi, and Tasikmalaya.

[Central News Agency, Sydney, 9th] Four Australian military officers have set off for Java to inspect the Dutch-Indonesian war as military observers. The U.S. government has also sent eight military police officers at the same time.

### Burmese Independence Bill to be Discussed in British House of Commons Next Month

[Reuters, London, 9th] When the British House of Commons reconvenes at the end of October, King George VI will attend and deliver a speech, during which he will announce the legislative plan for the Burmese regime. Authoritative political figures expect that the transfer of the Burmese regime case will be the first case discussed in the House of Commons' autumn program. The case is very brief and similar to the bill to transfer power in India.

### Secret Talks Held in Southern England

[Reuters, Vienna, 9th] It was revealed here today that British High Commissioner to Austria, Lieutenant General Steele, held secret talks with Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito in the Yugoslav summer capital of Bled, and an agreement has been reached on several important issues.

British sources here said that the talks were held because Marshal Tito, in view of the subtle way in which Lieutenant General Steele handled the South-Austrian border incident, wanted to meet with him before Steele left Austria to take up his new position to discuss several important issues between Britain and South.

[Reuters, London, 9th] Diplomatic figures here believe that Tito's decision to directly meet with British High Commissioner to Austria Steele is clear evidence of the easing of tense relations between Britain and Egypt. In recent months, the main issue of friction between Britain and South has been the repeated incidents in the border area between South and Carinthia province in the British-occupied zone of Austria. Tito's initiative to meet with Steele proves Tito's sincerity in resolving the disputes between the two countries. Officials here do not believe that a major resolution has been reached at the meeting in Bled.

### US Food Supply to Greek Troops

[Reuters, Athens, 9th] Griswold, head of the US aid mission to Greece, revealed today that the United States has taken over from Britain the responsibility of supplying food to 100,000 regular Greek troops since September 1st. This cost is estimated at US$28 million, and the accumulated food is now sufficient for three months.

### Marshall to Personally Attend the UN General Assembly; Japanese Peace Treaty to be Discussed Outside the Meeting

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] When Secretary of State Marshall leads the US delegation to the UN General Assembly next week, he hopes to confer with foreign ministers of other countries outside the meeting on the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty in order to gain the support of other countries for his original decision. If the Soviet Union still does not change its position, it will not allow the Soviet Union to participate.

[US Information Service, Washington, 9th] The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to open next Tuesday. The United States attaches great importance to it and will be led by Secretary of State Marshall himself as the head of the delegation, leading the delegation to New York this Friday. According to a State Department spokesman, the State Department will remain in New York until the four-power foreign ministers' meeting is held in London in November. Marshall's decision to spend two months working hard at the UN General Assembly shows the importance of the upcoming conference. Since Arne Lie led the delegation to attend the UN General Assembly in 1946, this is the first time that the US Secretary of State has personally led the delegation. The US delegation will begin work this Friday to prepare for the discussions. Of the five major powers attending this conference, except for the Soviet Union's Molotov, the other four countries will be attended by their foreign ministers. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie may arrive in advance to attend the opening ceremony. French Foreign Minister Bidault is expected to arrive in a few days. Bevin and Molotov will attend after the conference begins. In addition to Secretary of State Marshall, the US delegation also includes US Ambassador to the United Nations Austin and Mrs. Roosevelt.

### Anti-Communist Armed Guerrillas Discovered in Yugoslavia; Tito Can No Longer Conceal It

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 9th] There is a major situation regarding the Balkans that the world has not yet paid attention to, namely, the existence of large-scale anti-communist armed guerrillas in Yugoslavia. According to various sources, the South Country guerrillas are composed of patriotic elements who oppose the communist party and Soviet control, and are very similar to the Greek guerrillas. Both are instigated by foreign countries to resist the ruling regime in their own countries, but their representative doctrines and countries are different. Observers believe that this is tantamount to a blow to Tito with Tito's usual methods (namely, training, equipping, and supplying Greek rebels).

However, Tito has tried his best to avoid international knowledge of the existence of rebels in the country because he is eager to promote his iron fist. Yesterday, Belgrade officially acknowledged the existence of rebels for the first time, which was acknowledged by a statement issued by the head of the Belgrade News Agency. It is said that there are hidden rebels in the mountains, and Greek newspapers claim that artillery fire can already be heard in Greece, so Tito can no longer conceal it. It is heard that the South Country guerrillas are supplied and trained by the British-occupied zone in Austria, and their strength has increased sharply since July of this year, and as a result, they have occupied several important locations in South Country.

### British Delegation Personnel

[Central News Agency, London, 9th Special] The British delegation to the UN General Assembly was announced last night. Bevin is the chief representative, and the other representatives are Minister of State McNeil, Attorney General Shawcross, Colonial Minister Jones, and British Representative to the Security Council Cadogan.

### Lineup of the Soviet Delegation to the UN General Assembly

[TASS, Moscow, 9th] The Soviet Council of Ministers appointed the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly, with the following list: Delegation leader Vyshinsky, members being Soviet Permanent Representative to the Security Council Gromyko, Ambassador Zorin, Ambassador Rodionov, and Minister Sharapkin. Deputy members are Ambassador Stein, Minister Dolgilevsky, Counselor Arzumanian, and Counselor Roshchin.

[TASS, Kiev, 9th] The list of the Ukrainian delegation to the UN General Assembly is as follows: Delegation leader Manuilsky, Deputy Chairman of the Ukrainian Council of Ministers and Foreign Minister, members being Voina and Tymoshenko.

The leader of the Belorussian delegation is Kiselev, Deputy Chairman of the Belorussian Council of Ministers and Foreign Minister, members being Skorobogatko, Shmygov, Smolyar, and Kaminsky.

### To Implement the Marshall Plan for Aid to Western Europe, the United States Must Lend 21.9 Billion US Dollars; Experts from 16 European Countries Have Completed the Draft

[Reuters, Paris, 9th] Reliable sources said that the experts from the 16 European countries discussing the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe have decided that in order to implement the European four-year economic recovery plan, the United States must provide loans of 21.9 billion US dollars. Although this figure has been approved by the experts responsible for drafting the plan, it has not yet been approved by the Economic Cooperation Committee of the 16 countries, but it is expected that the latter's approval will not be a problem. This figure of 21.9 billion US dollars is 8 billion US dollars lower than the original estimate a few days ago. According to reliable unofficial sources, the US State Department has hinted that aid amounting to nearly 20 billion US dollars is easier for Congress to pass than aid amounting to nearly 30 billion US dollars. The reduction in the estimated figures by the European countries may be due to this reason.

[Associated Press, Rome, 10th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza has accepted the invitation of British Foreign Secretary Bevin to attend the Marshall Plan meeting to be held in Paris on September 15, at which French Foreign Minister Bidault will also attend.

### International New Tariff Agreement Mostly Completed

Smooth Progress in Anglo-American Tariff Negotiations

[Reuters, Geneva, 9th] The Geneva tariff negotiations are scheduled to conclude on Wednesday. It is expected that 70 new tariff agreements will have been completed or nearly completed by then. The remaining 38 include some of the most important ones. Mr. Lagat of the Secretariat, when reporting on the progress of the tariff negotiations, stated that if the negotiations can maintain their current pace, all negotiations could be completed by mid-August. Generally speaking, global trade barriers will be reduced as a result. The UK and Commonwealth delegation held negotiations with the US delegation this morning, having previously proposed several suggestions for reducing Imperial trade preferences. These negotiations are considered the most important of all. After receiving the new proposals, US representative Mr. Wilcox is scheduled to fly to Paris on Wednesday to meet with US Undersecretary of State Mr. Clayton to discuss the actions the US should take. It is expected that, barring a sudden change in Clayton's attitude, Anglo-American tariff negotiations should proceed smoothly from now on.

### Mediating the Anglo-Egyptian Dispute, China Proposes a Compromise, Security Council Debate Postponed

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Representatives on the Security Council are currently striving to bring the Anglo-Egyptian issue to a conclusion before the UN General Assembly opens next Tuesday. The Chinese representative is making particularly relentless efforts in this regard and is reported to have put forward a compromise proposal. A spokesperson for our side stated that the British side has welcomed any suggestion that facilitates the resumption of Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and acknowledges the validity of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. Currently, in addition to the Chinese representative, representatives from other countries are also working to find a compromise solution.

### Two Major International Financial Institutions Meet, Discussing Global Financial Situation, Dollar Panic to be Key Topic of Discussion

[Reuters, London, 9th] The International Bank and the International Monetary Fund are scheduled to hold a 15-day meeting here starting Thursday. Over 200 representatives and advisors from 45 countries held a preparatory meeting here today.

Simultaneously, representatives from the British Commonwealth and colonies will also hold talks amongst the Imperial nations of the Sterling Area to discuss the financial situation and dollar panic. While Imperial representatives are unwilling to predict the outcome of these talks, they have indicated that if some unified plan can be established to navigate the dollar crisis before a normal international trade plan can be formulated, the Sterling Area discussion could be elevated to governmental level. Observers express doubts as to whether the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund can both be used to resolve the British and European dollar panic, but they believe that the focus of this meeting will inevitably be the widespread global dollar shortage. These two international financial institutions hold billions of dollars, and if they can be circulated and utilized, Europe can maintain its survival and avoid suffocation during the transitional period before receiving aid under the Marshall Plan. However, as the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund were not originally established to address international financial difficulties, it is expected that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton will suggest amending the founding principles of these two institutions at the first meeting in order to address the current crisis.

### Europe Urgently Needs Funds, World Bank Unable to Assist

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] World Bank Vice President Garner stated at a press conference today: "It is a mistake for anyone to think that the World Bank can provide emergency funds for Europe to purchase food and other essential goods." Garner emphasized that the World Bank is subject to various regulations, and loans must be used for productive purposes. Regarding whether the bank will offer currency stabilization loans to rebuild the monetary system, he claimed that he was not aware of this. According to the bank's managing director, the bank can grant long-term loans to stabilize currencies. Regarding Poland's application for a $600 million loan, Garner hinted that this application may be delayed for a long time due to its decision not to participate in the European Economic Recovery Conference.

### France Establishes Special Committee to Cope with Dollar Crisis

[United Press, Paris, 9th] Following in the footsteps of Britain, the French government has also taken strict measures today to conserve its dwindling dollar reserves and to cope with the impending economic storm. It has also formed a special six-member "Franc Saving" committee, chaired by Prime Minister Ramadier, with Minister of Finance Schuman, Minister of National Economy Philip, State Councilor Goin, Governor of the Bank of France Monick, and the Five-Year Reconstruction Plan

### US Interim Aid to Europe Plan Must be Passed by Congress, Marshall Believes it is Necessary to Implement this Plan

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Marshall stated today that before the Marshall Plan can take effect and be implemented, an interim transitional aid plan is needed to cope with the unbearable cold and hunger this winter. However, this interim plan must also be passed by the US Congress. As for whether Congress will convene a special session, Marshall stated that no decisions have been made regarding the details. In any case, this transitional plan is also part of the Marshall Plan.

### Labor Movement Launches September Offensive, Japanese Government Considers Concessions, National Cooperative Party Denies Involvement in New Party Movement

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] While the Katayama Cabinet is resisting the recent political offensive by the Liberal Party, Katayama and others are quite firm on policy and have considerable confidence in their power. However, they seem to be having difficulty dealing with the so-called "September Labor Offensive," and are showing signs of being stretched thin. Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani, while inspecting Kyushu, met with representatives of small and medium-sized industries and stated that from November 1st, staple foods can be completely rationed, so life will be greatly improved. He is currently studying with Labor Minister Yonekuba how to resolve the problem before November 1st.

Government Determined to Remedy Too Low Standard Wage

The current average wage of 1,800 yen is quite unreasonable, and the use of deficit subsidies should be considered in the future. Furthermore, when Economic Stabilization Board Director-General Wada inspected the fisheries industry in Akita on the 9th, he hinted that the standard average wage of 1,800 yen could not sustain life, and said that the government did not need to freeze it. Looking at the opinions of Mizutani, Wada, and others, the Katayama Cabinet will make concessions to the movements demanding wage increases that are flourishing in various places in order to ease the labor offensive.

Coal Mine Nationalization Bill Unlikely to Pass Smoothly

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The Provisional Coal Mine National Administration Bill, drafted by the Japanese government in consultation with various parties, will be submitted when the Diet reconvenes. Based on the current situation, in addition to the Liberal Party, various small parties, and the Coal Mine Industry Association (capitalists) expressing opposition, the House of Councillors is also showing reluctance. Furthermore, the recent New Party movement also has an impact on this issue, so it is difficult to predict whether it can be passed smoothly in the Diet in the future. Nishio specifically stated on the 10th: "The coal mine national administration issue has become the key to determining the fate of the Katayama Cabinet. Deliberation in the Diet is expected to be quite difficult, but the government remains confident that it can pass. If it is aborted due to the opposition of the Coal Mine Industry Association, it will have a negative impact on the working masses, and the target of 30 million tons of coal production will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, if this bill fails, the main policies in the future will also be impossible to maintain."

Mining Industry Firmly Opposes, Minister of Commerce and Industry Helpless

Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani also met with coal mine operators in Kyushu in Fukuoka regarding the coal mine national administration issue, but because of the fierce opposition from the coal mine industry, the Minister of Commerce and Industry could not persuade them, and they eventually parted on unhappy terms.

[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Minister of State Miki of the Katayama Cabinet, who is from the Japanese National Cooperative Party, stated in Matsue City on the 9th that the rumors that executives of the National Cooperative Party are involved in the New Party movement of Liberal Party President Yoshida are completely untrue.

### Allied Headquarters Announces Opening of Sino-Japanese Commercial Telegrams

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Allied Headquarters announced on the 10th that it would reopen commercial wireless communication between China, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea. Telegrams from China and Okinawa must be relayed through Manila, while telegrams from Korea will be relayed through San Francisco or Manila.

### Britain Asks US to Bear Majority of Occupation Costs in British-American Zone of Germany

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Senate Appropriations Committee was summoned back to Washington on the 9th to hold an emergency meeting on the 20th of this month to discuss Britain's request that the United States bear the majority of the occupation costs in Germany. Britain believes it is having great difficulty paying these costs. Following the summoning of the Appropriations Committee, the Department of the Army announced that a meeting between Britain and the United States to discuss the occupation costs issue will be held here in early October. The British government is requesting a comprehensive review of the current occupation costs allocation method. According to the current expenses of the merged British-American occupation zone, the costs are borne equally by the two countries. The Department of the Army revealed that Britain believes that the reconsideration was stipulated in the agreement of last December and that the time has come.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] It was learned here on the 10th that the United States will demand unconditional control of the economy of West Germany to offset its burden of bearing most of the occupation costs. Senior government officials stated that Britain's annual costs in Germany exceed 270 million gold dollars. If the United States bears the majority of it, it should insist on taking greater responsibility for West German affairs, even to the point of having the United States economically control it. This new occupation strategy will give the United States full power and responsibility for dominating the German recovery effort.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] It was learned today that the United States has responded to an urgent request from London and is prepared to bear a large portion of the expenses of the British military occupation of Germany, possibly between 75 million and 100 million US dollars. Commissioner Monnet is a member of the committee, because the black market exchange rate of the US dollar has jumped to 287 francs, while the official exchange rate is 120 francs, so these emergency measures are being taken.

### Knowing He Cannot Escape Punishment, Tojo Converts to Buddhism

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Hideki Tojo knows that he cannot escape punishment for launching the Pacific War, so he ordered his close family members to prepare his posthumous Buddhist name as soon as possible. In April of this spring, he instructed his wife to ask his nephew Tokunaga Tetsuten, the chief priest of Mantoku-ji Temple in Ogura City, who had become a monk, to name him. After a long period of deliberation, Tokunaga named him "Eisho-in Shakushi Komyo Rango Koji" and chanted sutras for Tojo day and night, praying for his rebirth. Tokunaga also stated regarding this naming: "Initially, I planned to give him a Buddhist name suitable for a military person, but as a result, I wanted to use the power of Buddha to save his sins in his lifetime, so I adopted the Buddhist phrase 'bright and transcendent.'"

### Pu Yi Took the Stage Voluntarily

Providing Important Testimony

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Woodbridge, who has been a journalist in China for many years, stated in his testimony submitted to the International Military Tribunal here this morning that the puppet emperor Pu Yi was not kidnapped from Tianjin to Northeast China by the Japanese. Woodbridge's testimony is based on his conversations with Pu Yi during his visit to Changchun in September 1932. According to Woodbridge, Pu Yi was very happy with the position of "Emperor of Manchukuo." He also told Woodbridge that the two motivations for him to take the position of "Emperor of Manchukuo" were: (1) Since the Qing Dynasty attempted to hand over sovereignty to the people, civil wars and disturbances have occurred in China; (2) The Kuomintang was extremely "disrespectful" to him, revoked his salary, and confiscated his private property. Woodbridge also said that Pu Yi at that time said that he had decided to improve all aspects of his ancestors' place of origin.

### Allied Headquarters to Dissolve Japanese Farmers Association

[American News Bureau, Tokyo, 9th] Walker, a special correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, discusses the land reform plan in Japan in his recent communication. He stated that Japanese farmers are currently undergoing a dual revolution, which has now spread to the farthest corners of towns and villages. The first revolution is the land allocation plan of the Allied Headquarters, which aims to break the feudal tenancy system. Another innovation of the Allied Headquarters has not yet been launched, but it is ripe. The purpose of this plan is to dissolve the agricultural associations, which have represented the central government in controlling all matters of Japanese farmers for 48 years.

### Turkish Cabinet Resigns, Saja Ordered to Form New Cabinet

[United Press, Ankara, 9th] Turkish Prime Minister Beq resigned today due to illness, as his policies gradually came under criticism from public opinion inside and outside the party. President Inonu appointed Foreign Minister Saja to form a new cabinet. Mr. Saja has been in office for three years, and he has contributed greatly to the plan when the United States provided Turkey with a military aid loan of 100 million US dollars. He once served as Minister of Finance and is generally recognized as an expert in handling financial affairs. The new cabinet will be temporary in nature.

### US Population Statistics

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Census Bureau announced today that the US population in April of this year has exceeded 143 million.

### Britain to Implement Disarmament

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 10th Broadcast: Senior government officials stated that Britain will implement a reduction in troops to below the number previously proposed by Prime Minister Attlee. The extent of the reduction has not yet been determined, but it is by no means a change in strategy. Attlee had suggested reducing the British army to 1,007,000 by the end of March 1948 in order to reduce government spending and free up manpower for civilian work.

### Last

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 10th Broadcast: Marshall stated at a press conference that the Soviet Union has indeed rejected the US suggestion to hold a Four-Power conference to discuss the Korean issue. Marshall said that the US is discussing the holding of an Eleven-Nation Conference with the other ten related countries. In the near future, the US will issue invitations to all countries related to the Japanese peace conference.

### Nehru Determined to Exert Utmost Strength to Stop Indian Ethnic Strife, Gandhi Calls for Laying Down Arms and Restoring Peace

[Reuters, New Delhi, 9th] Nehru broadcast tonight, firmly stating that he will use all his strength to stop the riots. He strongly stated that revenge is not a good thing, and the current phenomenon is even worse than revenge. In the eyes of the world, this is simply an act of slaughter. From a military point of view, these acts of slaughter must be stopped. "Will we build a new India, or will we destroy it? We must stop this evil phenomenon. We must save the people of West Bengal and stop the acts of murder, arson, and robbery."

Persuading With Earnestness

[United Press, New Delhi, 10th] Gandhi announced today that due to the ethnic strife in Delhi, he has postponed his trip to Bengal and will reside in Delhi for a long time, "until it returns to its original state." Gandhi said, "I must apply the old formula of 'action or death' to the capital of India. As far as I am concerned, I must do my part to calm this mad atmosphere." He called on those "engaged in meaningless murder, arson, and robbery" to lay down their arms and said that not giving the new government a "chance to restore order" is tantamount to "criminal suicide."

Delhi Under Martial Law

[United Press, New Delhi, 10th] Just as all soldiers in the chaotic areas of New Delhi received "shoot-on-sight" orders, Gandhi, the elderly and respected master of peace, met with Governor-General Mountbatten on the 10th to discuss the ethnic killings and to discuss countermeasures to prevent atrocities. While Gandhi and Mountbatten were meeting, Major General Sin Chuan-li, commander of the Delhi region, ordered all officers and soldiers to restore order at any cost. The chaos in the city on the 9th was clearly reduced compared to the massacre on the 8th, but a mosque was still set on fire, and the martial law order was immediately restored as a result. The Delhi administrator ordered a ban on wearing swords, carrying weapons, and sticks. The Cabinet Emergency Committee issued a public announcement, ordering searches for weapons on train passengers.

### Fierce Fighting Between Jews and British Soldiers, 1,500 Jewish Refugees Refuse to Disembark in Hamburg

[Reuters, Hamburg, 9th] The third batch of 1,500 Jewish refugees on the British ship "Runnymede Park" engaged in a fierce battle with unarmed British soldiers for an hour and a half when disembarking here today. When the British soldiers entered the cabin, they did not use clubs, but after the battle became widespread, the British soldiers began to use clubs. Firefighters' high-pressure water hoses were used to spray the Jews inside the cabin. Women and children also fought hard, even more bravely than men. Jewish leaders held meetings on the ship all night yesterday, and held religious ceremonies this morning. The Jews sang the Jewish national anthem during the battle. Before ordering the disembarkation, the British military officer gave the Jews two hours to disembark voluntarily. The Jews ignored him, so he transferred troops into the cabin to force them to leave the ship.

### Judges Vote to Find Guilty, Sentence Ma Lai to Life Imprisonment, Civil Portion Broken Through, Family Members in Negotiations, Demand Compensation of 600 Million, Recover Gold Bars

[Reported by this newspaper] After five hours of secret deliberations yesterday, the US military court sentenced Ma Lai to life imprisonment and hard labor for life, ending the nine-day trial. This sentence will be submitted to General Rooks, the head of the US military advisory group, for review. Mr. Rooks has the right to agree to the sentence, and also has the right to reduce the sentence, but cannot increase it. The place where Ma Lai performs hard labor can also be decided by Mr. Rooks. After the court opened at 9:00 yesterday morning, the prosecutor listed the legal provisions in twenty minutes, explaining Ma Lai's crimes. The defendant's defense lawyer rose to argue that the Yu Shengxiao espionage case was not a conspiracy, and the conviction can only be limited to one person. The contradictions in Que Li's testimony are the best proof that Ma Lai is innocent, and so on. After the debate reached this point, the presiding officer announced the end of the debate, and all the judges retired to the lounge to hold a secret vote on whether Ma Lai was guilty. From 9:30 a.m. to 12:05 p.m., Colonel Palmer announced that it would reopen at 1:00 p.m.

Judges Repeatedly Hold Secret Deliberations

After reopening on time in the afternoon, they held another twenty minutes of secret deliberation. After the judges resumed their seats, they asked the prosecutor to announce the defendant's resume and his past criminal history. After reading it, the judges held a secret deliberation lasting one hour. At 2:20, the court reopened, and the presiding officer, Colonel Palmer, announced the verdict. Ma Lai and the defendant's defense lawyer stood silently to listen. The verdict stated that Ma Lai was charged with murder, and was found guilty by a majority of more than two-thirds of all the judges, and by a majority of three-quarters, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and hard labor for life.

### Defendant Forcibly Maintains Composure Upon Hearing Verdict

When Ma Lai heard the verdict, his face was flushed, his lower lip was stretched out, and he tried to appear brave and composed, but it was not difficult to see the pain in his heart from the dull expression on his face. Feng Lai committed armed robbery at the age of eighteen and was imprisoned until he was released in 1945. If he is sentenced to life imprisonment again, he will probably spend the rest of his life in prison. After the court's verdict, He Haiyan, the lawyer for the victim's family, told reporters that the civil portion of the case is that the victim's family demanded that Ma Yielai and Que Li jointly compensate the deceased's family for living expenses and children's education fees of 600 million yuan, and demanded the return of five gold bars.

Ma Lai's Portion of Compensation Under Negotiation with the US Military

Among them, the portion concerning Ma Lai is under negotiation with the US military compensation committee. However, the maximum amount that the committee has the right to decide is only 5,000 US dollars. If it exceeds this amount, it needs to be transferred to Washington for processing, and the time may be delayed for more than two years. It is hoped that the compensation committee can find a way to raise the payment limit or handle it in other ways. Because the deceased left behind a widow and three orphans who have no means of livelihood, based on human sympathy, this should be the case both emotionally and rationally. As for Que Li's situation of assets in Shanghai, it remains to be investigated, but as an accomplice to murder, he should be responsible for making as much compensation as possible.

### Over Ten Thousand Tons of Surplus Materials Arrive in Shanghai on the Haitian Ship

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's Haitian freighter, which went to Minas Island in July to carry the US surplus materials from the Materials Supply Bureau, completed loading and returned to Shanghai on the 1st of this month.

### Temporary Workers of the Huangpu Bureau Stop Work and Petition for Increased Benefits

[Reported by this newspaper] Over 500 temporary workers of the Shanghai Huangpu Bureau stopped work yesterday to demand increased benefits. In the afternoon, more than 300 people gathered to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. It is reported that in addition to the 500 temporary workers, there are also over 40 permanent workers in the bureau. The salaries of permanent workers are calculated according to the cost of living index. Before April, the salary for each temporary worker was 30,000 yuan. Recently, the workers requested an increase, which was adjusted to 35,000 yuan, but it still cannot sustain life. The temporary workers, seeing that the salary difference between them and the permanent workers is too great, demanded that it also be calculated according to the cost of living index, but it was rejected by the bureau. Therefore, they petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance. Because the Huangpu Bureau belongs to a state-owned institution, the Social Affairs Bureau was inconvenient to mediate the dispute. At that time, the petition was transferred to the Huangpu Bureau and asked to handle it themselves as soon as possible. The 300 petitioning workers did not get results, and because most of them came to Shanghai from Gaoqiao and Wusong, they could not make it back. After negotiating with Shen Ding, director of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, they agreed to stay overnight in front of the Social Affairs Bureau Square last night. They are also scheduled to continue petitioning the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and the General Labor Union today.

### Municipal Government Finalizes Budget Preparation Standards for Next Year, Living Allowance Reserve Changed to 120 Billion

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Government convened a meeting in the conference room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the general budget for next year. The meeting was attended by the heads of various bureaus and departments, chaired by Mayor Wu. The chairman stated that the budget for next year must be based on income and expenditure, and must not exceed the Municipal Government's possible income of over 983 billion next year. Because the central government cannot subsidize it, and the Municipal Government's income is limited, each bureau must re-reduce the budget, and after it is collected by the accounting office in the shortest possible time, it will be submitted to the council for approval.

The reporter visited Min Xiangfan, the director of the accounting office, after the meeting. He said that the standards for preparing the budget decided during the meeting were as follows: regular expenses are based on the current personnel and current work expenses. Temporary expenses (newly emerging business expenses) are based on two times the total budget for the 36th year. According to this ratio, the budget for next year will be led by the Public Works Bureau, followed by the Public Utility, Police, and Education Bureaus. Furthermore, according to the original regulations of the Municipal Government, 180 billion yuan was reserved in the total income of over 900 billion next year as a reserve for adjusting living allowances. At yesterday's meeting, it was generally believed that this reserve amount was too large, and it was decided to reduce it to 120 billion. Therefore, the remaining 60 billion yuan will be redistributed to the bureaus, and the proportions are as follows: Public Utility Bureau 33 billion, Public Works Bureau 18 billion, Police Bureau 8.4 billion, Social Affairs Bureau 3.6 billion, Health Bureau 4 billion, Land Administration Bureau 3 billion.

### Director of Public Works Bureau Shakes Head and Sighs

When the reporter visited, Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau was hotly debating the budget issue with Director Min. Director Zhao said that the budget was too small and all projects could not be carried out. Director Min said that the Municipal Government has made the greatest efforts and there is really nothing else that can be done. Director Zhao also shook his head and sighed to the reporter, saying that the cost of engineering materials has increased tenfold, but the budget is only allowed to increase threefold. How will next year's work be carried out?

### The Residents of Zhu Zhai Oppose Being Under the Jurisdiction of Jiading County

Representatives from Various Bureaus to Inspect the Area

Regarding the issue of the provincial and municipal boundary demarcation, after the Executive Yuan instructed that the Panlong Port and Xiao Lai Port in the western suburbs of Shanghai be the natural boundary, the news that Zhu Zhai Township was to be placed under the jurisdiction of Jiading County was received. The various sectors of Zhu Zhai Township expressed that if this division is followed, although the southeastern half of the township would still belong to the urban area, the northwestern half would be under county jurisdiction, thus the township would again fall into a situation of being split into two, which they find difficult to accept. Therefore, on the 9th, they convened a township-wide residents' assembly, resolving to, in addition to appealing to the relevant authorities for consideration and calling on the Municipal Council for righteous assistance, also appoint representatives to appeal to the Central Government, hoping that they will respect the public's opinion and keep the northwestern Zhu Zhai Township north of the Panlong Port within the urban area, so as to maintain its integrity. Otherwise, they vow to not cooperate with the county government, which lacks any facilities, to show their firm determination.

Furthermore, according to reports: After the boundary demarcation issue was decided, the municipal and provincial public works, police, and other bureaus, as well as the Department of Civil Affairs, have each dispatched representatives, who were scheduled to depart together this afternoon to conduct on-site inspections in the respective areas and discuss handover and subsidy issues with the local county government.

### Traitors are Changeable, but Justice is Inevitable. Wu Chuiying Reported, Arrested, and Detained. Li Shi Qun's Adopted Son, Former Chief of the Wuxi Puppet Police Bureau, Becomes Transportation Section Chief at the Fishery Market After the Victory.

[Central News Agency Report] Wu Chuiying (originally named Yi Geng, also known as Yi Geng, pictured), a captured traitor who held important positions in the puppet regime, committed numerous evils, and transformed himself into the transportation section chief of the Shanghai Fishery Market and the director of the volunteer police force after the victory, was recently reported. The Songhu Garrison Headquarters dispatched personnel on the morning of the 10th to arrest the criminal at his office in the Yangshupu Fishery Market. He is currently being temporarily held at the Garrison Headquarters Detention Center and will soon be transferred to the High Procuratorate for legal action. The criminal is a native of Jiangwan in this city and served as the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Shanghai City Defense Corps before the war, under the name Wu Yi Geng. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he changed his name to Chuiying and defected to the enemy, serving as the chief of the Wuxi County Police Bureau and the major general deputy director of the 76th Special Operations Headquarters' training class (the notorious Li Shi Qun of the 76th Headquarters also served as the class director, and Wu once recognized Li as his adoptive father). The personnel he trained served as guides for the Japanese army in the so-called "Clean-up Areas." The people in the Wuxi area hated Wu to the bone. In 1941, the current Director of the Supervisory Office of the Garrison Headquarters, Lu Peng (alias Dada), was ordered to infiltrate behind enemy lines to engage in counter-espionage work and was once arrested by Wu on October 30 of that year. After accepting the puppet regime's orders and serving as a puppet official, Wu committed numerous evils and arrested underground government workers. Unexpectedly, after the victory, Wu used the large amount of gold and silver he had plundered to lobby and operate, actually managing to escape justice. Wu also served as the transportation section chief at the Fishery Market under the name Yi Geng and as the director of the volunteer police force. In order to uphold justice, Lu Peng recently, in his capacity as a victim, submitted a report to Commander Xuan Tie Wu, accusing Wu of his crimes. After Xuan approved it, to prevent the criminal from escaping, the deputy head of the investigation team, Xiang Qiang Wei, led officers to arrest the criminal on the morning of the 10th. The criminal was wearing a Hong Kong shirt at the time and did not resist, only saying that he wanted to return home to get clothes. After being refused, he was taken to the Garrison Headquarters Detention Center in a jeep car for temporary detention. It is reported that although he tried to remain calm inside the detention center, he could not hide his panicked expression. He carried with him some so-called supporting documents, as if he knew that his "crime would be exposed."

### Bai Lu's Fatal Fall, Manager of the International Hotel Summoned

[This Newspaper Report] Regarding the case of female movie star Du Xiaomu (Bai Lu) fatally falling in the International Hotel elevator, Mr. Yves Jiang Chao filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing the manager of the International Hotel, Foge, and others of negligence, resulting in death. This morning, Prosecutor Fang Zheng summoned the manager of the hotel, Foge, and the deputy manager and engineer, Wu Shuang Yin, to the court for questioning. According to Foge, the elevator used by the hotel was produced by the American Otis Elevator Company, and it is entirely electrically operated. The elevator door has two layers, inside and outside, which are automatically opened and closed. The inner door closes quickly, and the outer door closes slightly slower to prevent passengers from being crushed. When the elevator inner door closes, the elevator starts to rise. At this time, there is still a four-inch gap in the outer door, and Du suddenly rushed to this place, trying to pull open the outer door and step in. Unexpectedly, the elevator had already risen at this time, causing Du to fall to her death. The court hearing was adjourned for another hearing. Both defendants were ordered to return home.

### Husband Suspects Wife, Stabs Her with a Knife

[This Newspaper Report] Yu Nan, a 31-year-old man from Northern Jiangsu residing at No. 85 Yaoshui Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei, married Tang Fangying, 24 years old. They had been married for several years, and their relationship was harmonious.

### Dance Industry Representatives Petition Separately, Requesting the Revocation of the Ban on Dancing or Implementation of a Similar Plan to the Ban on Opium, to Give Employees a Chance to Change Careers Gracefully

[This Newspaper Report] In order to request a postponement of the ban on dancing in this city, in addition to sending representatives to Nanjing to petition various central government agencies, this morning they also went to the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and local associations in two groups to petition. In the afternoon, they continued to petition the Federation of Trade Unions and the Women's Association. One group that went to the Social Affairs Bureau arrived at around 10:00 AM, and the petition representatives included investor Chuan Fang Gui, Ni Ming De, Zhuang Hong Cheng, Gu [Blank], musician Chen Run Sheng, employee Wu Shou Gen, dancers Shen Li Fang, Jin Mei Hong, Hong Xiao Ping, and workers Wang Bu Dou, Lao Zhi, Chuan Huan Ting, and Liu Xue Geng, totaling more than ten people. The written appeal requested three points: (1) Revoke the order banning dancing. (2) If it cannot be revoked, the government should immediately resolve the issue of career change. (3) If neither of the above two points can be achieved, the government should implement a plan similar to the five-year opium ban, to give employees a chance to change careers gracefully, to avoid the suffering of unemployment and starvation.

Relying on Dance for a Livelihood

The petition representatives originally intended to meet Director Wu to express their plight in person, but because Director Wu had gone to Nanjing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, they were received by Section Chief Yuan Wenzhang of the Fourth Section. The dancer representatives again stated that it is not easy for dancers to change careers to become female workers. Most dancers have heavy family burdens, relying on their livelihood to support several family members, and dancers rely on their dance skills to make a living. Once unemployed, the consequences would be unimaginable. At this point, they covered their faces and were about to cry. Section Chief Yuan expressed that he sympathized with the plight of the dance industry, but said that the principle of banning dancing was determined by the central government, and the local government could only be responsible for its implementation. Director Wu is very clear about the situation of the dance industry, and in the opinion on banning dancing submitted to the central government, he stated the plight of the dance industry in this city in great detail. All the appeals and written appeals of the dance industry were also submitted to the central government for reference.

Many Letters of Complaint Received

Section Chief Yuan believes that the extravagant lifestyle of general red dancers also needs to be reviewed by the dance industry itself. If Chuan Xia Danwei's dance ticket income reaches tens of millions of yuan in one night, this kind of extravagant style cannot be allowed to continue, and China and England are paying close attention to this. The petition representatives said that this is a very small number of exceptional cases, and they asked the authorities to still consider the livelihoods of the majority of dancers. Section Chief Yuan promised to forward the written appeal to the central government, and the petition representatives then left.

It is reported that before the petition yesterday, a dancer originally intended to take her child to the Social Affairs Bureau to complain to Director Wu, but was later dissuaded. In addition, Director Wu has recently received many letters of complaint from dancers, one of which stated that her husband is unemployed, and she has two children, so a family of four relies on her dancing as a living. After losing her job, she has no way to make a living.

Going to Nanjing to Petition, Returning to Shanghai on the Evening Train

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Shanghai dance industry representatives, including Sun Hong Yuan, Shen Zhi Min, and Meng Yan, and a group of ten people, arrived in Nanjing by plane at around 10:00 AM on the 10th. They went to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to petition, requesting (1) the revocation of the ban on dancing; (2) responsibility for providing career changes; (3) reference to the opium ban method of a five-year ban. Director Yao of the Ministry of Interior and Secretary Yang of the Ministry of Social Affairs expressed that the ban on dancing is a government law and is difficult to change, but promised to forward their difficult situation. When the representatives went to the venue of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, they were received by Hong Lan You. Shen Zhi Min and Meng Yan tearfully stated that they were forced to dance due to the heavy pressure of life in order to maintain the livelihood of their families, and hoped that the authorities would be sympathetic to their difficulties. Hong promised to convey this situation to the entire meeting. The representatives, having completed their business in Nanjing, returned to Shanghai on the evening train that day.

### XMHD Stops Broadcasting Because of Failure to Register

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, Dong Xian Guang, replied to a reporter's question about "Why was Shanghai's XMHD radio station ordered to stop broadcasting" by saying: The station began broadcasting on August 15th without the approval of the Ministry of Communications and without applying for registration. This violates the regulations for the establishment of radio stations, so it was ordered not to broadcast until approved by the government. Last Saturday, the Shanghai Western newspaper also reported that the Songhu Garrison Command ordered the station to stop broadcasting foreign language programs because "English programs are not allowed to be broadcast in China." This is completely inconsistent with the facts. There are no regulations in our country prohibiting the broadcasting of foreign language programs. Article 24 of the regulations for the establishment of radio stations stipulates that "The language of broadcasting should be mainly Chinese language, unless the radio station has a special mission approved by the Ministry of Communications." The order for XMHD radio station to stop broadcasting is entirely because it has not completed registration procedures. Any radio station may not broadcast without approval.

### Elderly People Who Have Not Reached 60 Years of Age Are Not Allowed to Hold Extravagant Birthday Celebrations. The Municipal Government is Considering Limiting All Unnecessary Entertainment.

[This Newspaper Report] A reporter visited the responsible authorities of the Municipal Government yesterday to inquire about the implementation steps of the city's savings measures. According to reports, the city does not have rigid regulations on savings, nor has it formulated a general mobilization implementation plan. However, when it is found that savings are needed in any aspect, effective methods are discussed and formulated at any time. At present, the municipal government believes that the first target of savings is banquets. The Social Affairs Bureau has now drafted a plan, and Director Wu has taken this plan to Nanjing to seek instructions from the central government. As for the implementation steps, it will be discussed at the municipal meeting tomorrow. In addition, the municipal government is also considering saving on unnecessary entertainment, such as not allowing elderly people under 60 years of age to hold extravagant birthday celebrations, not allowing banquets to be held for non-official matters, and simplifying celebrations of joy and funerals as much as possible, in order to gradually cultivate a thrifty atmosphere.

### North-South Ocean and Yangtze River Freight, Additional Levy of Charity Donations in Various Places, Fees Received in Guangdong and Guangxi to be Reported and Remitted Within a Time Limit

The Shipping Federation and the Shanghai Shipping Association recently notified local associations and member companies that, according to the instructions of the Executive Yuan transferred by the Ministry of Communications, the Shipping Federation's previous decision to add 2% to the freight rates of ships traveling on the North-South Ocean routes as disaster relief funds for the two Guang provinces, and the later decision to add 5% to the passenger fares and 2% to the freight rates of ships traveling on the Yangtze River trunk line to be used as disaster relief funds in Northern Jiangsu, have been rejected by the Executive Yuan. After learning of this, the Shipping Federation decided at a meeting: (1) Local associations and member companies should immediately report and remit the disaster relief fees received in Guangdong and Guangxi, which must be completed before September 20th. (2) Ships traveling on the North-South Ocean routes and the Yangtze River trunk line will collect 2% of the freight rates as charity donations for various places for a period of six months, starting from September 10th and ending on March 9th of the following year.

### Conscription About to Start, Implementation Must be Thorough, Volunteer Registration Shows Enthusiasm

According to a statement issued by Zhang Tingsong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government: Shanghai's handling of military affairs was originally a pioneering effort, and there are many difficulties. However, conscription is one of the mobilization tasks, and its execution must be thorough to complete the major task. The conscription period is approaching, and what can be reported is as follows:

(1) The registration of volunteers in this city began on the 25th of last month and has lasted for two weeks. Initially, because issues such as family settlement fees had not been resolved, the number of people going to various districts to register was small. After improvements were made, such as ordering each district to organize a farewell meeting for volunteers joining the army and launch a comfort campaign, and setting up a volunteer registration office in the new recruit conscription center, according to reports from conscription supervisors sent to various districts, the registration situation has become enthusiastic. It is scheduled to begin conscription on the 15th of this month, and by the end of this month, the 3,000 volunteers will be completely conscripted.

(2) The family settlement fee for volunteers should be 4 million yuan, which is to be raised by the Military Service Association of this city. This amount requires more than 100 billion yuan. The preferential treatment funds for draftees exempted from military service and the preferential treatment funds for households with no draftees going to war have just begun to be collected, and there is a shortage of funds. Currently, the mayor has negotiated with the municipal bank to borrow 2.5 billion yuan to advance to the Military Service Association. The Military Service Association is currently handling the procedures. This 2.5 billion yuan will be used to pay the family settlement fees for volunteers to be conscripted on the 15th of this month.

(3) The crime regulations for obstructing military service formulated by the central government are very strict. Conscription is mobilization. If efforts are not made to conscript enough volunteers, personnel at all levels in districts and baos will be punished. The Civil Affairs Department has repeatedly ordered each district to work hard to meet the needs of mobilization and has recently sent personnel to various districts to supervise and urge the work.

(4) The first batch of volunteers conscripted in this city has been negotiated with the regiment management area and is scheduled to be allocated to a department on the 15th of this month. At that time, the Military Service Association will hold a warm send-off meeting for them to join the army. It is heard that citizens in various districts will also spontaneously launch send-off events.

### Hooligans Invite Dancers, Obstructed, Destroy Tables and Chairs, Detained

### Expanding Fundraising for Student Aid, Forming "Special Fundraising Team," Hoping Enthusiastic Readers Will Do Their Best to Support

In order to expand the effectiveness of fundraising for the "Reader Student Aid Fund," we have launched a "Special Fundraising Team" to solicit donations from all levels of society. The units participating in the special fundraising team include banks, advertising agencies, and general companies and businesses. With the enthusiastic assistance of many commercial groups, we hope that the fundraising work can be widely carried out. However, this kind of "Special Fundraising Team" will not achieve satisfactory results without the support of enthusiastic readers. Here, we sincerely appeal to our readers to give the "Special Fundraising Team" the greatest support and promotion, in order to achieve the expected goal of ten billion yuan as soon as possible.

Yesterday, Mr. Zhuang and Mr. Wang Juerong each generously donated one million yuan, and Mr. Wang is our familiar sponsor.

### Field Inspection of Zibo Mining Area: Light Metal Factory, Leading in East Asia

[Report from this newspaper, Zhangdian, 5th] On the way back to Zhangdian from the Zibo area, passing through Nanding (Zichuanma), I had the opportunity to visit the light metal factory that was praised by the Japanese invaders as being the leading one in East Asia.

This factory officially started construction in February of the 32nd year [1943], when the Japanese invaders named it the "North China Clay Soil Company Zhangdian Light Metal Factory." It is estimated that the reserve of aluminum alone is 20 million tons in Wangcun, 50 million tons in Hutian, and countless tons elsewhere, and the alumina content is as high as 45% to 75%. No wonder the Japanese invaders praised it incessantly, saying, "Shandong's aluminum mine is inexhaustible."

Because Japan itself produced too little aluminum to meet the massive consumption during the war, after formally building a factory in Nanding in October of the 32nd year, the initial plan was to complete it in seven years, then changed to five years, then to three years, and finally, with full spirit, the strike method was changed to one and a half years. By May of the 34th year, the first of the five boilers in the plan was finally completed and formally started to produce aluminum.

While officially building, the Japanese invaders recruited 800 elementary school and junior high school graduates from Tianjin and Zhangdian and sent them to Japan for eight months of training. By the spring of the 34th year, they returned to China to serve as the factory's basic, that is, low-level technical and management personnel. As for middle-level staff, they were filled by Taiwanese, and high-level staff by Japanese. Until the eve of the Japanese invaders' surrender in August of the 34th year, the employees who continued to be responsible for building the remaining four boiler projects in the factory reached 35,000. At that time, from Zhangdian through Nanding, Zichuan, to Boshan, the air was full of high-voltage power lines and telephone heavy car electric light lines, and the underground was railways, highways, tramways, light railways, crisscrossing like a dragnet, creating a spectacle. According to Mr. Geng Zhanyuan, a current Shandong Provincial Senator who was engaged in underground work at that time, the factory's east and west plants, together with the residential guards and other districts, covered an area of five square kilometers. Inside, 24 warehouses stored a total of 2,500 pieces of electrical equipment ranging from 5 horsepower to 200 horsepower, 5,000 tons of miscellaneous grains, 10,000 tons of flour, and 50,000 bolts of cloth. All the machines needed to build the factory had almost been shipped in, but until August 21st of the 34th year, when the Japanese army surrendered, the communist bandits invaded on the 23rd of the same month. The 1,500 Japanese troops stationed there retreated without a fight, and the communist bandits took the opportunity to loot all the stored grain, flour, cloth, and machinery that could be moved. The communist bandits occupied the area for 18 days. On September 14th, the Japanese army, under government orders, recovered the factory. The Ministry of Economic Affairs then sent Han Bingduo, who was then an engineer at the Xihe Yuesheng Coal Mine, as a representative to handle the "looting" with the factory director, Oda. Han asked Oda to recreate the original inventory list, overreporting the value. Oda once said with tears in his eyes, "I can't change it without letting down my friends, but I can't change it without letting down my country."

After Han "looted" the factory, the local National Army team was responsible for guarding it. The local team had no fixed funding during the war and mostly requisitioned grain on the spot. Since the factory had no grain to requisition, it dismantled and sold things from the factory to make a living. According to Geng, only in terms of alkali material, the original storage was 1,000 tons, but by the time the ceasefire order was issued on January 13th of the 35th year, only 200 to 300 tons remained!

On January 13th of the 35th year, the bandits disregarded the ceasefire agreement and made a second invasion, capturing and killing Han Bingduo. Before the second withdrawal on July 11th of the 35th year, they again transported important movable machinery, steel materials, and all furniture to the Yimeng Mountains via the Zhangbo branch line and then by car from Badou.

On July 11th of the 35th year, the National Army recovered Zibo for the second time. The National Army's 73rd Army then sent a battalion of troops to garrison Nanding, and the National Resources Commission established the Shandong Aluminum Company, with a Mr. Ruan in charge of the takeover.

It once started operation employing a hundred workers to begin reorganization inside but less than a month later, operation stopped again. The reason being that the National Resources Commission didn't come up with the money to cover the employees' living expenses. After operations ceased, a Mr. Zhang was assigned to guard it. As a result, some machines, motors, scattered equipment, and other materials left through the "back door." On February 23rd of this year, the communist bandits invaded for the third time, and the custodians retreated to Jinan. By August 17th, the National Army had recovered it for the third time. It has been more than half a month since then, and the National Resources Commission has not sent anyone to take over. The local National Army has not dispatched regular troops to garrison the area, nor has the National Resources Commission requested additional troops. When the reporter visited, all I saw were dilapidated houses, ruined buildings, and broken machine parts everywhere, and wild grass grew luxuriantly, reaching knee-high, making it appear even more desolate. Before the reporter and others went to visit, they had already asked the garrison in Zhangdian to

deploy a company of soldiers to the nearby area to defend them. There was also a platoon of soldiers accompanying the reporter as guards. Initially, we did not expect that while the reporter and others were in the middle of the visit, dense gunfire suddenly came from the southern part of the factory area, and we knew that there must be communist bandits lurking inside. Helplessly, we had to withdraw hastily midway and drive to Zhangdian under strict guard.

Oda, the factory director in the past, once told people that the total construction and equipment costs of the factory amounted to 30 billion Japanese yen, and this factory alkali had been listed by the Japanese side as part of the war debt compensation. However, according to Geng, only one-fifth of the machinery that remains today is left. A gentleman traveling with us once said to the reporter with great emotion: "Lattimore once said: 'The fruits of victory that China has won in the War of Resistance will tend to be destroyed in the subsequent wars.' Today, I visited the first light metal factory in East Asia, and it has implicitly confirmed Lattimore's prediction. It is not others who are destroying China's victory, but the Chinese Communist Party." (Special Correspondent Li Tian)

### Hong Kong-China Trade Suffocates, a New Trick Appears: the "All-Access Import Permit"

[Report from this newspaper, Hong Kong, 5th] The Hong Kong trade market, shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere, has not benefited at all since the government announced the amendment to the "Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Management Measures" and the amendment to the "Import and Export Shanghai Trade Measures" on August 17th. On the contrary, due to changes in the settlement methods, the focus of exports has also been shifted from Hong Kong to Shanghai.

Just as Hong Kong merchants were at a loss, a new trick of an "all-access import permit" suddenly appeared at the Kowloon Customs by accident. The method is as follows: The customs specially allows livestock, poultry, fresh fish, vegetables, eggs, and other goods to be transported from various parts of South China to Hong Kong. At the same time, it allows the purchase of goods in categories II and III (A) (excluding automobiles and films) listed in the appendix to be imported, and when passing through the Kowloon Customs at all checkpoints with the permit, they can be verified and released without the need to obtain an import permit, which has been implemented since August 23.

Why did the Kowloon Customs come up with this new trick? Some say it is one of the exchange conditions of the Hong Kong-China Economic Cooperation Agreement. The Hong Kong government allows assisting China's customs in cracking down on smuggling, and the Chinese customs allows Guangzhou to import food urgently needed by Hong Kong. However, since the Hong Kong-China Economic Cooperation Agreement has been aborted, there is no doubt that it is implemented separately first. Another saying is that the Chinese customs, seeing that Hong Kong-China trade is dying and smuggling is becoming increasingly rampant, wants to try this new method to completely cut off the source.

Regardless of the motivation, the "all-access import permit" does give the Hong Kong market a great excitement. It immediately became a valuable security that everyone scrambled to buy, and there is a daily market price. Initially, it was 40% higher than the original amount, but now it has risen to 60%. Guangdong merchants, seeing where the profit lies, do not hesitate to massively purchase livestock, poultry, vegetables, fresh fish, and eggs to Hong Kong, especially livestock. Recently, the supply of livestock in Hong Kong has exceeded demand, and prices have plummeted. Merchants have suffered heavy losses in the price of goods, but fortunately, the "all-access import permit" is a rare commodity that can be stocked up, and the losses in the price of goods can still be recovered from another aspect.

The "all-access import permit" is not a legal term, and according to its nature, it is not "all-access." It has the following many restrictions: (1) Return goods are limited to Guangzhou; (2) All goods are not allowed to be re-exported after arriving in Guangzhou; (3) The number is small and difficult to buy in large quantities; (4) Imports and exports are only at the Da Jing Pass, which stipulates that ships under 200 tons can come and go, so goods transported to Guangzhou cannot be transported by large ships, and the risk is greater.

It is not clear how long this new trick will be tested, but it is generally predicted that this is only a temporary expedient to give Hong Kong merchants who have suffocated a breather. In the future, when Hong Kong's food imports are too much and the merchants' losses reach the point where they can no longer be compensated by the "all-access import permit," this method will automatically lose its function and be terminated. Let's watch! (Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng)

### Our Delegation Proposes to the YMCA to Establish Universal Principles of Basic Education; Full Text of Proposal to Be Submitted to General Assembly Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Far East Basic Education Conference held its first and second group meetings on the morning of the 10th. All representatives and experts who originally participated in each group attended. The meeting's situation and resolutions are recorded as follows: (Shen) Group 1, "General Administration Group," chaired by U Ba Lwin (Burma), resolved the following key points: (1) The definition of basic education should adhere to the fundamental concepts established in the publications of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), with particular emphasis on "a common foundation for all people," and should adapt to the needs of children and their social and material environment. (2) No rigid decisions were made regarding the duration of schooling; further research is needed, and decisions should be based on each country's national conditions, local environment, and other factors. (3) The ultimate responsibility for basic education rests with the central government, but assistance should be obtained from other agencies and local organizations to determine the nature and content of education. (4) Adult education should be based on the principle of non-compulsion, but compulsory methods may be adopted in certain special circumstances in large industrial and urban areas. (5) All schools should emphasize moral education, the meaning of which is to promote correct thought and life. Religious instruction should be determined by each country. (6) Basic education should be co-educational. (7) Education authorities should obtain the cooperation of other government agencies and social organizations. (8) Specialized agencies should be established to train adult education personnel. (9) Under the guidance of UNESCO, each country may obtain international assistance through voluntary donations within the next five years. This assistance is limited to special projects in certain regions of each country. (10) Each country may levy an education tax for basic education, the details of which shall be determined by each country. The education tax rate and the national economic capacity should be studied, especially in the Far East countries. (11) Improving the treatment of teachers is a problem that should be addressed worldwide. To attract talented young people with modern professional training to engage in education, teacher compensation should be sufficiently high to guarantee their basic living needs and be equal to other professions. (12) Basic education should be completely free. (13) The training of basic education personnel is generally the same as the opinions put forward by the preparatory meeting. Vocational training and intellectual education should be given equal importance.

Language Teaching Outline

(B) Group 2, "Technical Methods Group," chaired by Dikshya (Nepal), discussed the language teaching outline drafted by our delegation, represented by Cheng Qibao, based on the opinions of the preparatory meeting and UNESCO. Key points of the resolution: (1) Language teaching should pay attention to the different levels, different individuals, and different social needs of the educated. (2) The mother tongue should be the main teaching tool. Experts should conduct thorough research, improve it, and assist ethnic groups without written languages in creating a writing system or selecting a suitable writing system. (3) Those who have successfully learned their mother tongue should be encouraged to learn other auxiliary languages. (4) Experts should be assembled to conduct research on phonetics and phonetic symbols. UNESCO can also establish a central research institution and several working branches to conduct research. (5) Regarding basic literacy vocabulary, it is hoped that it will be gradually and greatly expanded according to the needs of the educated to read newspapers and write letters, the differences between grades and life, and the requirements of modern knowledge, and divided into central vocabulary, auxiliary vocabulary, and 30 categories of specialized vocabulary. (6) In addition to learning from reading materials, teaching methods should make extensive use of visual aids, projectors, charts, specimens, and other new-style collective teaching tools and methods. UNESCO should provide assistance in a unified plan for the supply of these needs.

The discussion items of the two group meetings were completed on the morning of the 10th. The reports will be submitted to the general assembly in the next few days. Once passed, they will become resolutions of the general assembly, and will be sent to the UNESCO regional research meeting and the UNESCO Second General Assembly for reference and adoption.

Passed Three Proposals

At 3 p.m., the third group, the "Content and Teaching Material Group," held a group meeting (the originally scheduled general assembly was postponed to the morning of the 11th), chaired by Basson (New Zealand), passed three proposals: (1) Wang Zongjing (Malaysia) proposed to investigate local customs that are harmful to health and hygiene, and carry out educational reforms within the scope that does not hinder freedom of religion. (2) Luo Ruisi (UNESCO) proposed that UNESCO prepare a complete set of wall charts and teaching aids for general knowledge, which will be distributed to various places for application. Ai Weidang, advisor to our delegation, proposed that in addition to widely using various indirect teaching aids, we should also pay attention to the actual education methods of using real objects, such as the promotion and education of good seeds. Direct methods are far more effective than indirect methods, which was accepted by the meeting. (3) Qu Juchen proposed to formulate basic principles for basic education, which will be applicable to any region and any country, so that basic education can truly be the foundation for all people. Every person can understand their rights and responsibilities as a citizen of the world. The full translation of the Chinese delegation's proposal can be submitted to the general assembly on the 11th. As for the general content of basic education that was not discussed at the meeting on the 9th, Ling Suisi is still compiling it and will complete this work that night and submit it directly to the general assembly. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m. The tea party hosted by Chairman Jiang, which was originally scheduled, was temporarily suspended due to unforeseen circumstances. At 9 p.m., all the representatives watched the Beijing opera "Finding the Princess" until midnight, and dispersed happily.

### Rice Industry Association Discusses Salt Affairs; Issue of Organizing a United Transportation Company; Decision to Prepare Opinions for Chairman Wu to Review

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Municipal Food Allocation Committee intends to establish a storage and transportation office in order to enrich the city's food reserves during the new grain season. It will entrust rice merchants to organize a United Transportation Company to purchase a large amount of rice from the producing areas to be stored in Shanghai for emergencies, so as to maintain normal grain prices. The funds for the United Transportation Company are tentatively set at 5 billion yuan, and the government can lend 10 billion yuan if necessary. Chairman Wu Kaixian convened rice merchants a few days ago to solicit their opinions on this matter. The Rice Industry Trade Association then convened a meeting of directors and supervisors at 3 p.m. yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Qu Zhenhua, Xu Songren, Hu Wenan, and Zha Baosan. Wan Molin served as chairman. The discussion on the issue of organizing the United Transportation Company was very heated. Some people agreed and some people opposed it. The reason for those who opposed it was whether the rice price could be stabilized with certainty after the establishment of the United Transportation Company? Furthermore, purchasing a large amount of rice from the producing areas to Shanghai can stimulate the price of rice. If the price of rice rises at that time, can it be guaranteed that the public opinion's attack on rice merchants can be eased? After careful discussion, it was decided that the association would first draft its opinions on this issue and the articles of association of the United Transportation Company and submit them to the Food Allocation Committee, and then make a decision after Chairman Wu Kaixian returned to Shanghai. During the meeting, it was unanimously believed that rice merchants were unable to bear the funds of 5 billion yuan for the United Transportation Company. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. According to Wan Molin's interview with the reporter, rice merchants have had many past experiences. For example, the implementation of grain loans has not been successful, but has caused panic among rice merchants in the city. After Zhang Jia'ao took charge of the Central Bank, he has repeatedly wanted rice merchants to assist in stabilizing rice prices and proposed that rice merchants could be allowed to mortgage rice to the government at an 80% discount. Rice merchants have not agreed. Now the authorities want to entrust the establishment of a United Transportation Company, and rice merchants still need to consider this carefully.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Pays Attention to Rising Flour Prices

[Our Dispatch] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association received an order from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs on the 9th, which was forwarded from the Municipal Government on the 4th, stating: "The Ministry of Food's telegram opened: 'The prices of flour and rice in Shanghai have been rising continuously in recent days. At this moment, the re-export of rice must be approved by this Ministry, while the export of wheat is prohibited, and the price is stable. Flour is subject to a quota-based re-export period. The rising price of flour is a phenomenon that should not occur.

### Raising Loan Interest Rates: Four Banks Joint Office to Hold Meeting Today to Discuss

The issue of raising loan interest rates has been a topic of much discussion recently. It has been learned that this matter has been debated for several years, and the old issue has been brought up again. It is reported that the Four Banks Joint Office will submit the issue for resolution at today's board meeting. According to relevant sources, China's industry has gradually laid its foundation, and the low-interest funding provided by state banks has not been without merit. However, 80% of the funds needed for loans come from ordinary commercial banks, with state banks accounting for only 20%. Therefore, the calculation of production costs and interest expenses is based on commercial banks. In general, raw materials account for 50% of production costs, labor costs account for 40%, expenses account for 5%, and interest, calculated at market rates, is less than 5%. Interest calculated at state bank rates is only 1%. The production process for industry is very short; therefore, raising loan interest rates has no impact on production costs and cannot stimulate general price increases. If general manufacturers hoard low-interest products and do not sell them, their interest costs will naturally increase. However, most borrowers are for daily necessities. Since they are daily necessities, they should have appropriate sales channels and there should be no hoarding. Otherwise, low-interest funds may flow into speculation.

### Group Dividend Savings, Second Phase Projected at 4 Billion

Although there have not been many depositors since the program started, based on the experience of the first phase, the number of depositors in the last ten days of the month will be significantly higher than in the first two ten-day periods, so the results of this phase may exceed the projected figures.

Actual market demand was strong, and speculators took the opportunity to drive up prices. As a result, 42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn was pushed up to 19 million yuan, a further increase of 650,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of yarn, both coarse and fine, such as 20-count, 16-count, 42-count, and 40-count, also rose across the board by varying amounts from 300,000 to 600,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth Rises

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw improved sales in various regions, increased demand from merchants on Changjiang Road, and urgent restocking from dye factories. Local sales turned brisk, and prices rose sharply. The most traded item throughout the day was 20-count extra fine cloth, with dye factories purchasing 400 to 500 pieces at a price of 400,400 yuan, an increase of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day. "Dragon Head" fine cloth once rose to 525,000 yuan, but after limited trading, it fell back to 517,000 yuan, an increase of 9,000 yuan. Other grades of fine cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, twill, khaki, and shirting also rose by varying amounts from 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

### Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Holds Meeting of Standing Directors

[Special Dispatch] The 85th meeting of the standing directors of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association was held yesterday at 11:00 AM in the Association's meeting room, chaired by Wang Qiyu. Six important cases were discussed. Among the more important ones was the fourth case, concerning two proposed motions for the upcoming Second General Meeting of the National Yarn Factory Association. The motions were that woven products made from self-spun yarn should not be subject to business tax, and that machine printing fees should be based on the number of deposit slips at a rate of 500 yuan per piece (i.e., per slip). The motions requested the General Meeting to appeal to the Ministry of Finance for approval. It was resolved that Cheng Jingtang would be responsible for reviewing the motions before they were submitted to the meeting for discussion.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Ease

Yesterday, the sugar market trended soft, continuing its downward trend. The Association's quoted prices for spot goods were initially 690,000 yuan for Grade 2 raw sugar and "White Chu," later falling to 687,000 yuan, a decrease of over 10,000 yuan. "Hechi" was at 690,000 yuan, "Shanti Qing" at 627,000 yuan, down 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, with dozens of bags traded. "Diao Qing" was at 580,000 yuan, then down to 570,000 yuan, with hundreds of bags traded, down over 10,000 yuan. "Xinghua White" (bagged, high-quality) was at 760,000 yuan, down 10,000 yuan, and "Xing Chi" was at 640,000 yuan, down 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with 300 to 400 pieces traded. It is observed that recent actual sales have been relatively low, hence the market price is gradually easing.

### Eight Types of Public Bonds Drawn for Redemption

The following eight types of public bonds, were drawn yesterday in Shanghai for principal redemption: the Republic of China 25th Year Unified Public Bond (Class B), the 17th Year Long-Term Financial Public Bond, the 25th Year Readjustment of Guangdong Financial Public Bond, the 25th Year Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bond, the 26th Year Guangdong Province Port River Engineering U.S. Dollar Public Bond, the 28th Year Construction Public Bond (First Issue), the 28th Year Military Supplies Public Bond (Second Issue), and the 30th Year Military Supplies Public Bond (Third Issue). All winning bonds, except for the 26th Year Guangdong Province Port River Engineering U.S. Dollar Public Bond, where the assigned Guangdong Customs surtax for principal and interest payment was seized by the enemy, resulting in a temporary suspension of payment of principal and interest until the funds are cleared and a new repayment date is set, the principal and interest of the remaining bonds will be paid by the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau in accordance with the original repayment dates stipulated in the bond regulations.

### Unified Bonds Fall Again, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise

Public bonds fell sharply again yesterday. Rooms 230 and 538 saw some buying of "Dacheng New," while Room 550 and others were selling. "Unified C" fell from 14,001 to 12,900 yuan at the close. As a result, "Unified A" and "B" fell by 800 yuan compared to the previous close, "Unified C" fell by 700 yuan, "Unified D" fell by 1,100 yuan, and "Unified E" also fell by 900 yuan. Trading volume was only around 5 million yuan.

Foreign stocks continued to see buying interest yesterday, and the upward trend of small stocks remained strong. Jewish investors provided support, Guangdong investors entered and exited, and securities firms and retail investors were buying. "Ewo Yarns" opened at 92,800 yuan, with a low of 92,200 yuan and a high of 93,800 yuan, hovering around 93,000 yuan at noon. As a result, "Jardine Matheson" rose by slightly less than 10%, while "Wing On," "Paper Industries," and "Steel Industries" rose by 5%, and other stocks saw slight gains.

### Bullish Investors Take Profits, Chinese Stocks Trend Weak

Chinese stocks appeared to be ignored yesterday. Any apparent gains at the opening quickly dissipated, as short-term profit-taking bullish investors took profits, causing prices to fall again. Interest rates in the over-the-counter market opened high at 19.5 fen and 24 fen, but soon became unsustainable, with even less trading and a bleak situation. Prices stabilized somewhat near the close.

The market opened strong, carrying the momentum from the previous close. "Wing On Yarns" opened higher, and No. 32 was still being bought, rising to 247 yuan. Nos. 186 and others collectively took profits, creating an oversupply situation. Nos. 104 and 152 were slightly bought in the middle of the day, but the momentum could not be sustained, and prices eventually fell to 239 yuan. Nos. 157 and 152 absorbed the selling pressure, slightly recovering.

After 10:30 AM, over-the-counter interest rates opened at 19.5 fen and 24 fen. With Nos. 85 and others selling heavily, signs of borrowing also appeared, and prices fell to 235 yuan. Spot trading also saw a low price of 235 yuan. After 11:30 AM, No. 157 maintained stability, and Nos. 223 and others bought in, briefly rising to around 240 yuan near noon. Nos. 65 and 235 sold again, and "Wing On Yarns" spot trading closed at 238 yuan. Bidding prices were weak after the close.

As a result, among spot trading stocks, "Hua Feng," "New Light," and "King Fook" saw slight gains. "Wing On Yarns," "Meiya," "Wing On Public," and "Qin Xing" saw slight declines. "New China" fell by 5%, "Sino-French," "Xinghe," and "Innerwear," "China Textile" were flat. "Li An" fell by 5%. "Rong Feng," "Matches," and "Jing Lun" saw slight gains. "Tai Tung," "China Silk," and "Commercial Press" saw slight declines. Among deferred trading stocks, "Hua" and "Jing" were flat. "Wing On Yarns," "Xinghe," "Meiya," "New Light," and "Qin Xing" saw slight declines. Over-the-counter old stocks were generally stable.

### Zhabei Water and Electricity Stocks to be Listed on a Trial Basis Tomorrow

[Special Dispatch] Yesterday, the Stock Exchange held its 24th Board Meeting, passing three important cases: (1) Zhabei Water and Electricity Co., Ltd. stocks will be listed on a trial basis on September 12th. (2) The deadline for deferred trading is approaching at the end of September, and it was decided to consult with the base to extend the deadline. (3) The Stock Exchange's 1 billion yuan scholarship fund will be jointly managed with the Municipal Government's Scholarship Review Committee.

### Financial Industry Special Business Tax: Bankers Association Requests Reduction

The National Financial Industry previously stated that the special business tax promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, with a tax rate of 4% and a tax law based on income (including interest, handling fees, exchange spreads, etc.), was too burdensome. They had submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for exemption, which was subsequently rejected by the Ministry. The Ministry instructed local bankers' associations to comply. It is now learned that the National Bankers Association has resolved to reduce the burden on member banks in various regions and to comply with national policies and increase national treasury revenue. They have once again requested the Ministry of Finance to reduce the originally set tax rate and re-determine the calculation of income. The submission was telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance for review on the morning of the 10th. Once the Ministry of Finance decides on the measures, the special business tax for the financial industry nationwide can begin to be implemented.

### Rayon Market is Quiet

Rayon's 38th allocation is due for payment and delivery today, so the market was quiet yesterday, and prices remained unchanged, fluctuating between 5.8 million and 5.9 million yuan throughout the day. The transaction price for No. 120 "Gold Three Horses" was 25.9 million yuan, and the selling price was quoted at 6 million yuan, similar to the previous day.

Because the autumn flood season was poor, market sentiment was positive, and yesterday's trading volume increased by 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The asking price for D-grade was 32 million yuan, and for E-grade it was 1.5 million yuan, both with 7-day futures. Although there were no transactions for ABC grades, asking prices also rose accordingly. The head price for 28.5 dan of dried silk was 21.5 million yuan, also up 500,000 yuan from the previous day.

Because factories were bullish, raw silk comforter covers opened higher, but because merchants had tight cash flow, selling outweighed buying, and prices fell back. "Dacheng Huajiang" prices were the same, opening at 2.63-2.64 million yuan, then gradually falling to close at 2.42 million yuan spot price, and 2.5 million yuan for deferred delivery, up more than 200,000 yuan from the previous day. There were still no transactions for "Meiya" goods. "Grid Crepe" asking price was up 1,000 yuan, and other autumn sales goods remained firm.

### Tung Oil and Bristle Purchase Work Concludes

[Special Dispatch] According to the Central Trust Bureau, the Bureau was previously ordered to purchase tung oil and bristles, but the purchase work was concluded after the government revised the exchange settlement and import/export trade measures. To date, the total amount purchased by the Bureau is approximately 7,500 metric tons of tung oil and approximately 6,300 quintals of bristles. The total amount sold is approximately metric tons of tung oil and approximately 3,300 quintals of bristles

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Endless Rent Increases; Poor Civil Servants are Overwhelmed

Editor: I am a low-ranking civil servant currently living in a flat (a small room) in the Xujiajiao area of Yulin Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai. When I moved in in October of the 34th year, I spent a small fee, and the monthly rent was only 1,500 yuan. From December of the 34th year, it increased to 3,500 yuan. From February of the 35th year, it increased again to 10,000 yuan. In May, it suddenly increased to 60,000 yuan. It has increased forty-fold in seven months. At that time, I was too busy with my own life, and because of time constraints, I was unable to negotiate with the landlord. Now the landlord is asking for two dou of white rice per month in rent. The price of rice has risen to more than 500,000 yuan per dan. Sir, how can someone like me, with a monthly income of several hundred thousand yuan and burdened with the heavy responsibility of supporting a family, afford a monthly rent of more than 100,000 yuan? Generally speaking, this rent price exceeds the rent price of Western-style houses in the city center. Now I have several questions, please answer: (1) Is their unlimited and outrageous price increase legal? (2) Can this price increase be refused? (3) Now he wants to use white rice as a basis for rent. If the second item cannot be refused, can I pay according to the official rice price? (4) Can I file a lawsuit with the court as a last resort?

[Answer by Lawyer Chuan Kuangling] (1) The rent for houses in urban areas is limited to 10% of the declared total value of the land and buildings per annum and cannot be arbitrarily increased. (2) You can legally refuse. (3) The Municipal Government has explicitly prohibited changing the rent payment to rice. (4) The parties may petition the court to increase or decrease the rent.

### The Pacific Two Years After the War

— Translated by Bao Zhongqi

(Translator's Note) The author of this article, Bob Bloomber, is an American war correspondent. He traveled to various islands with the military during the Pacific War. Two years after the war, he revisited these places and was filled with many emotions, leading him to write this article.

I recently returned from a 30,000-mile journey in the Pacific, a ghostly trip. Having served as a war correspondent in the Pacific, I thought I was very familiar with the endless azure sea, but I was wrong. I couldn't find the landmarks, the cemetery on Wake Island, and I got lost on Okinawa. I couldn't accurately locate any of them. The tides and jungles blurred my memories. I felt alone and wondered if I could bring myself to leave this place. Below are my observations and experiences at Pacific outposts:

Pearl Harbor: We arrived in Honolulu on a Sunday—a Sunday as peaceful as the day of Pearl Harbor (the day of the Japanese sneak attack). We cherish a photo of the chaotic Pearl Harbor, with ships engulfed in smoke and flames, and no one on land able to take emergency measures. Now, over five hundred warships are quietly docked in the harbor. At the same location as in the photo, a destroyer is slowly patrolling the sea. The "China" is docked at the pier. On the shore, there are only a few military vehicles. Everything indicates peace. This diamond-like city is gradually returning to its pre-war rhythm.

Tarawa: Three days later, our plane landed on Tarawa. In one corner of the island, I found what used to be rubble, scorched earth, and corpses everywhere, a truly unbearable sight. Today, this place has greatly changed. Officials stroll along the beach, filled with a peaceful and happy atmosphere. Only one Japanese tank is half-submerged on the beach. Some of Tarawa's desolation remains daunting. This is the only island we encountered that still needs assistance. A few newly planted palm trees replace the ones destroyed by the war.

Saipan: We found this place to be a paradise in the Pacific. I once witnessed the takeoff and landing of B-29 planes at the airfield here. Revisiting it today, it feels completely different. It is no longer a base for attacking Japan, and there are no large groups of aircraft to be seen. Except for a few rubber tires, no traces of war can be found. Saipan has been quickly rebuilt.

Guam: During the war, this was the site of a "hide-and-seek" game between American and Japanese forces. Bunkers and caves have now been transformed into wide highways, with jeeps driving endlessly. During the Japanese occupation, only 24,000 Guam residents survived. They are now diligently engaged in the restoration of Guam under the supervision of the military government, developing it into a new Pearl Harbor in the Pacific.

Manila: Manila suffered the most severe destruction during the war, but its post-war reconstruction has been quite rapid. Although 60 percent is still in ruins, large-scale construction plans have already begun. Filipinos feel that they fought side by side with the American forces during the war, making the greatest sacrifices, and should receive the greatest American assistance after the war.

Okinawa: This island, where the fighting was most intense, was almost fought inch by inch, with every foot of land subjected to a desperate battle, even a broken church. When I came here for the second time, the church had not yet been completely restored. An American soldier told me that there was nothing depressing about this place.

Tokyo: The capital of Japan has clearly undergone a great change. I once entered Tokyo with other journalists before the occupying forces arrived. At that time, our impression was of chaos, desolation, and disorder. This time, I came to Tokyo again. Overlooking the entire city from a high building, what entered my eyes were modern buildings, neat streets, and beautiful gardens. Today, Tokyo's cultural development has reached its peak. Who would have thought that Tokyo had suffered countless bombings during the war! I saw American soldiers selling souvenirs on the streets of Tokyo, and I also saw American military police and Japanese police jointly directing traffic.

Hiroshima: The end of our journey was Hiroshima. I clearly remember the scene of entering Hiroshima shortly after the atomic bomb was dropped: the faces of the survivors struggling to survive, an old woman digging through debris in broken tiles, like a bald tree in a dead city. The transformation of Hiroshima surprised me greatly. More than 50,000 houses have been built, and trams and buses are running in the city. Hiroshima has fully recovered its vitality. I asked an old man why he came to Hiroshima. He said, "This is my home." Yes, everyone has his home, so I hurriedly concluded this long journey through the Pacific.

(Translated on the Victory Day of September 3rd)

Translator's Note: The current state of the Pacific two years after the war is deeply moving. In particular, Tokyo and Hiroshima offer us very profound insights. Others have already moved forward, and we must catch up.

### The Ghost Festival

— (Recorded from this newspaper on August 31st, Guangxu Year 19)

The seventh month is the month of ghosts, and many neighborhoods are holding the annual Ghost Festival again. This is how it is now, but fifty years ago, it was naturally even more valued.

"The water and rice bag industry in this port held a grand Ghost Festival a few days ago. In the evening, they arranged a full set of ceremonial items and paraded around. There was a five-colored dragon lantern, with scales and armor looking lifelike; several pairs of illuminated signs, shining brightly; a raised platform, with people dressed up as characters from stories; a flower boat, with clear singing answering each other, as if touring the West Lake. Ten 'free and easy' fans, several 'ten thousand people' banners, eight parasols, with candles burning in the middle, creating the illusion of an open city that never sleeps. Led by several monks, they circled around the Great East Gate, Da Shu, Yiqing Bridge, Temple East, and other places, before returning to the guildhall. When they reached the Small East Gate, some of the attendants burned paper money along the way. Suddenly, two beggars, A and B, rushed over, vying to grab the ashes. A was as strong as an ox, not allowing B to take anything. B questioned him, and A rubbed his palms and repeatedly slapped B's face, causing B to bleed from the mouth. B immediately fell to the ground, shouting for help. Pedestrians stopped to watch, not understanding what was happening. They asked what was going on. B recounted the events. A certain C, feeling indignant, stepped forward to drive A away, but A had already disappeared without a trace."

The Ghost Festival is originally a superstitious activity, costing money and effort. Fifty years ago in China, when science was not prevalent, there might have been some justification for such actions, but even then, upright gentlemen did not approve. Now, in the 1950s of the twentieth century, atomic energy has begun to be applied, yet such superstitious actions are still being performed, which is extremely foolish. Moreover, with the smoke of war still lingering, the rubble not yet cleared, and severe floods occurring, it is even more inappropriate to use useful money for such useless activities.

### Utopia on Ice

— Ming Sen

People are always dreaming of a "Utopia" in the world, where there are no armies, no fortresses, no unemployment, no illiteracy, no hunger, no cold, and no criminals. Well, there is indeed such a place in the world, and it has existed for some time.

This place is called the "Republic of Iceland." It has no army, navy, air force, or any military organization; everyone has a job; its budget is balanced; every adult man and woman and school-age child can read and write.

If it is said that there are no criminals in this island nation, it may not be entirely accurate. Petty theft sometimes occurs, but the serious crimes that plague other countries are extremely rare. Iceland's most recent murder occurred in 1928. A small thief killed the owner of something he stole. Even after twenty years, people are still talking about it.

Regarding the merits of this country, consider this fact: Iceland is currently the only country in the world that is not requesting loans from the United States. During World War II, the American soldiers stationed in the country reportedly could not find a single "Jeep girl" to socialize with.

Perhaps surprisingly, Iceland's climate is quite mild. Although it is high up in the Arctic Circle and is sometimes surrounded by ice floes and glaciers, its coast is warmed by the "Gulf Stream." Therefore, its winters are similar to those of Philadelphia in the United States. Its summers—June, July, and August—sometimes see the thermometer rise to the seventies. Its average annual temperature is 39.4 degrees.

However, one thing about Iceland is indeed very peculiar: due to its location so far north, its winters are almost entirely dark, and its summers are entirely daylight. In the summer, Icelanders follow the clock—not going to sleep when it gets dark, because the nights are as bright as the mornings. In midwinter, there are only about four hours of daylight in a 24-hour day.

Many people think that most of the residents of Iceland live in igloos under accumulated snow, like primitive Eskimos. In fact, not only is this not the case now, but it never has been. In the early ninth century AD, some Irish monks came to the island to escape the secularity of their homeland. About seventy or eighty years later, adventurers from the Scandinavian Peninsula began to arrive in Iceland. The first to settle there was a Norwegian named Ingólfr Arnarson. He carried the pillars for building his house with him; when he saw Iceland, he threw them into the sea, saying that he would settle at the place where they washed ashore. He later named the place where he built his home "Reykjavík," which is the location of Iceland's capital today, with a current population of 48,000.

So many people migrated to the island following Arnarson that within sixty years, all habitable land was filled. In fact, it was so crowded that the Irish monks found it too noisy and abandoned Iceland. The current Icelanders are white, blonde, blue-eyed, and of robust build, and could pass for people from the American Midwest.

Fishing is the main source of livelihood for Icelanders. Its seas are full of sharks, herring, crabs, cod, haddock, and even whales. At one time, Iceland was one of the largest fishing nations in the world; although many of its ships were destroyed during the war, it still hopes to restore its former prominence. Its two major industries are the refining of fish oil and fish meat.

How much Icelanders love learning can be seen in this fact: about 30,000 people of Icelandic descent live in the United States and Canada—because the opportunities to make a living using knowledge are greater in these places than in Iceland—and almost all of these people are "freelancers," such as doctors, lawyers, teachers...

### Miscellany in America

Xu Yuan

Many Americans build houses without consulting carpenters or bricklayers, but they themselves do not run carpentry or bricklaying businesses. Carpenters and bricklayers in America are quite expensive, so most people are unwilling to bother them, preferring to do it themselves. Building a house in America is not a difficult task. The blueprints are readily available. You only need to choose a suitable one from a building magazine, and then go to the materials company to order the materials. Door frames, windows, roofs, and floors are all available in stock. The sizes are fixed. Call a truck to bring the ready-made materials back, and assemble them according to the ready-made blueprints and instructions. Hammer here, add a nail there, and a small bungalow with four or five rooms can be built in three or four days. Then, make a phone call to the furniture company, and in a while, all the furniture, including the mirror frames, will be delivered. If you want to save even more, you can buy unfinished furniture and paint it yourself. This unfinished furniture is more than half the price of finished furniture. A small bedside table only costs nine dollars, and the unfinished furniture has fewer blemishes, so you can choose as you like. American women, in addition to managing household affairs, put on work clothes in their spare time, paint floors, whitewash walls, wash cars, and feed cattle and sheep, and are proficient in almost everything. After finishing work, they immediately dress up in flamboyant clothes, looking beautiful and charming. Some Chinese women are not good at needlework but are proficient in drinking, gambling, dancing, and socializing. Others wear coarse clothes and skirts, completely becoming an old nanny type, but there is little flexibility. A standard woman should be a combination of a noble lady and a sacred worker, a lady when going out, a virtuous wife at home, and a romantic companion at night. I do not agree with Hitler's "women back to the kitchen," but I advocate that they often go to the kitchen, and not eat out or drink tea at restaurants every day. (50)

### Save Traffic

— Kang Shi

Military vehicles "intersect," roads "do not pass,"

Competing for light, fearing to be behind, a chaotic commotion;

Passersby are seen as ant-like lives,

"Save Traffic" is infinitely meaningful!

The streets of Shanghai are "intersected and impassable" because there are too many vehicles, and everyone is "competing to be first and fearing to be behind," "rushing and colliding," viewing passersby as not even "worth an ant's life." Now the authorities are holding the "Double Ninth Traffic Festival." "Double Ninth" is homophonous with "Save, Save." With the current chaotic traffic order and the daily increase in deaths under the wheels, "Double Ninth Traffic" is better said as "Save Traffic."

Science Essay

### Hermit Crab

— Zhou Xingchu

There are people selling "Taiwan Field Snails" by the roadside, asking a very high price, five thousand yuan per piece. Curious people buy them back to raise, store them in glass tanks, add yellow sand, change the water frequently, and feed them food, so they can live for a long time, which is quite elegant. In fact, its grand name is "Hermit Crab," also called "Parasitic Crab," or "Nest Snail," also called "Bochan," commonly known as "Crab Snail."

Hermit crabs are the most common and most interesting animals on the seashore. People who visit the beach for the first time see something in the pool, clearly an empty shell of a jade corn snail or a textured snail, suddenly a hermit crab's leg stretches out, shakes, and crawls away, and they are very happy and very surprised, and they can't forget it for a long time. An arthropod actually uses a mollusk's shell to defend itself, which is indeed very strange. But once we see the tail of a hermit crab, we understand why it has to live in something else to protect its life. It is really because the tail is too soft and too drooping, so it needs to rely on something else for defense, in order to reproduce.

If you carefully observe a hermit crab, you can't help but admire it. They are both alert and agile. Although they carry a heavy shell, they still move very nimbly. They like to fight, and sometimes one can forcibly pull another out of its shell and occupy it. Sometimes they wait there for a neighboring friend, and if they risk leaving the shell far away, they will unceremoniously occupy it, shrink into the depths of the shell, and close the door tightly. When the friend who went out comes back and sees this tragedy, there is nothing they can do but find another shell. When they are fighting, or confronting foreign races, they often lose a limb, or damage a limb, but it doesn't matter, because like many crustaceans, the next time they shed their shell, that is, when they change their outer skin, they will always regrow a complete limb.

In peacetime, the hermit crab first carefully stretches out its head, revealing its stalked eyes, short and trembling antennae, (the base of which has a balancer) and long and lively antennae. Then the claws are revealed, the right claw is always much larger than the left. Then there are two pairs of long legs for walking, and the other two pairs are short and not exposed. The tip of the tail has a pair of strong appendages like sickles, which are fastened to the borrowed shell, very tightly. The remaining tail appendages are only on the left side. It is said that males have three and are small, and females have four, the first three are strong and used to hold the released eggs. It is destined to move its two pairs of legs quite fast, but if it encounters obstacles, it immediately shrinks back, still like a snail shell. The speed of this reflexive return is extraordinary. Another action that should not be missed is moving from an old shell into a new shell. When it finds a satisfactory new home, it will suddenly move in, as fast as lightning. Ordinary hermit crabs change multiple homes during their lives as they grow larger.

The fertilized eggs of the hermit crab are adhered to the bristles on the second, third, and fourth abdominal limbs of the female, forming a purple mass, where they develop, regardless of the season. The hatched young are small, free-swimming larvae. The female closely steps out of the borrowed shell, exposing a part of her body, and brushes the laid seedlings into the water, which must go through four free-swimming periods (water flea body), which involves the process of molting, and then to a short, strange dimorphic phase, called silver-gray larvae. These larvae live on the seabed during the day and swim to the surface of the sea at night. In a few days, they will grow all the characteristics of a hermit crab.

Hermit crabs can eat many kinds of things, their appetite is huge, and there is almost nothing they don't eat. They love to eat animals, whether dead or alive, they eat them frantically. Sometimes they also eat seaweed. The large claws are used to grab food and send it into the mouth, and then to the jaws and gill feet, which tear or crush the food, and then the food passes into a strange sand sac for digestion.

Regarding the hermit crab's eating, there is another strange thing, that is, there is often a kind of sea worm called "Sesame Worm," which lives in the cracks and hidden places of the shell borrowed by the hermit crab, and usually does not eat or move. When the hermit crab eats, it comes out to share the scraps of food that fall from its mouth. In some places, fishermen even specialize in catching "Sesame Worms" as bait for catching "Hermit Crabs."
