[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 16th] Communist forces outside Tianjin began plotting to disturb the city from the 14th. The authorities have increased troop deployments for strict defense and have completed arrangements. The Communist forces' conspiracy to harass has been thwarted. This morning, on the 16th, a large number of National Army troops arrived in Tianjin for reinforcement, and public morale is trending towards peace.

[United Press, Peiping Dispatch, 16th] It is reported that over ten thousand troops under Fu Zuoyi arrived in Tianjin from Chahar on the 16th to reinforce the defense. After the troops arrived, they immediately set up defensive fortifications outside the city.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 16th] Official confirmation: The war on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is still raging. It is confirmed that Cangxian County was invaded by Communist forces on the night of the 13th. The defending troops broke through and retreated to the suburbs. National Army reinforcements coming south from Tianjin counterattacked yesterday and re-entered the city. Furthermore, Cangbei Qingxian, Chen Guantun, Tang Guantun, Xingji and other places have been harassed by Communist forces fleeing north since yesterday and fierce fighting is also underway.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin Dispatch, 16th] According to this morning's air force reconnaissance, the national flag with a white sun on a blue sky still flies high over Cangxian County.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 16th] The military announced that several thousand Communist troops have landed at Gaoshacen, south of Tanggu. National Army troops are being dispatched to intercept them. Near Dabo Village, south of Tianjin, four to five thousand Communist troops moved towards foreign areas of Tanggu on the 15th.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 16th] As the battle on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway progresses, the National Army is advancing south from Chen Guantun. This morning, the 16th, a large number of National Army reinforcements were dispatched from southern Tianjin. The situation south of Chen Guantun is chaotic. The train line from Tianjin to Jinghai is clear.

[United Press, Peiping Dispatch, 16th] Tianjin authorities today officially acknowledged receiving orders from the government to blockade the line from Tanggu to Shanghai, covering the coasts of Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu provinces. It is widely believed that the purpose of this measure is to prevent large sailboats carrying supplies and soldiers from Dalian from flowing into Shandong. According to unofficial sources, Dalian is a base for disrupting the National Army because Communist forces are using the area as a supply station, capable of sending reinforcements to obstruct the National Army's hopes of reopening the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. In other news, the Tianjin Public Utilities Bureau has received a notice from the naval authorities to prepare berths for Chinese warships. China recently acquired nine minesweepers from the United States. Meanwhile, the situation in Tianjin is tense. Troops are patrolling the streets in military trucks, and guards are stationed for the first time in the street corner fortifications built last year. Workers are digging trenches on the south side of the city. The curfew, which began at 10:00 PM, has entered its third day today. Despite these signs of a state of military affairs, it is generally believed that Tianjin and Peiping remain safe.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 16th] Gunfire was heard again in Peiping yesterday. There was fighting near Caiyu, southeast of Peiping, and the invading Communist forces were repelled.

Traffic was restored at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The Longwangmiao Railway Bridge on the Peiping-Tianjin line was temporarily repaired, but due to insufficient load capacity, it is still being reinforced.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch, 16th] A unit of the New Sixth Army captured nine Japanese in the Communist army in Zhonggu (near Shenyang, 30 kilometers away) and has escorted them to Peiping for interrogation. According to their statements, they belonged to the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the Communist army.

Seven out of ten of the Communist army's artillerymen are Korean, all of whom voluntarily came to the Northeast to participate. They all knew that only after escaping to our side would they have the possibility of being repatriated, so they dared to take the risk to surrender. The names of the nine Japanese are as follows: (1) Yoshio Matsumura (2) Kisuke Ki (3) Hiroshi Mitsuno (4) Kakuzo Daiji (5) Kakuten Shibutani (6) Teruhiko Yamamoto (7) Kiyoshi Takahashi (8) Tsukasa Oki (9) Tadashi Hashimoto.

### Yongtai Warship Bloodshed

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 16th] A bloody tragedy of a ship affairs officer shooting the captain occurred on the Yongtai warship of the First Northern Patrol Fleet on its return trip from the Northern Patrol to Qingdao.

The ship has now sailed to Qingdao, and the injured personnel have been hospitalized for treatment. The murderer Ji Rui has been sent to the military court for trial. Ji and the deceased were classmates. Ji reported for duty in March of this year and was originally intended to replace the deceased. Ji is usually silent and seems to have a mental disorder.

### The Soviet and Mongolian Governments Give Indirect Responses to Our Government's Protest, Moscow Broadcasts Statement from Outer Mongolia Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Soviet and Mongolian sides have not yet sent a written reply to our protest regarding the Xinjiang incident, apart from making indirect responses in broadcasts. Reporters from various newspapers have been inquiring at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs every day, but the only answer they received was: "This Ministry has not yet received any written reply." They refused to disclose whether we will lodge another protest. According to a senior government official, the authorities are handling the Xinjiang affair with solemnity and are still studying whether to lodge another protest.

[United Press, London Dispatch, 16th] A broadcast from Moscow Radio quoted a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic as saying: "Mongolian border guards were forced to repel Chinese troops who had crossed into Mongolian territory under the cover of aircraft." The radio station went on to deny Chinese reports of attacks on the Chinese border and denounced them as fabrications with a clear provocative intent.

According to the radio broadcast, the truth about the June 5th incident was that "a detachment of Chinese troops violated the border of the Mongolian People's Republic, deployed a sixteen-kilometer-long position in the Meirding Gol River (transliteration) area, dug trenches, and reinforced their troops while attacking a Mongolian border guard post. The commander of the Mongolian border guards sent personnel to meet with the Chinese military commander and demand that they withdraw from Mongolia, but was refused, and the envoy was detained. Therefore, the Mongolian border guards were forced to take measures to repel the invaders. A detachment of border guards, under the cover of several aircraft from the Mongolian Air Force, forced the invaders to withdraw from the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Mongolian border guards did not cross into Chinese territory when taking this military action. After the Chinese troops withdrew, the bodies of the Mongolian military envoy and four border guard soldiers were found in the Chinese military camp on June 9th, all with signs of severe torture. The Mongolian People's Republic has lodged a strong protest with the Chinese government and reserves the right to demand that the Chinese government severely punish the perpetrators and compensate Mongolia for the losses it has suffered."

### Moscow Broadcast Inconsistent with Facts

Chenghua and Beitashan are All Chinese Territory

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] According to the Moscow broadcast received here, the Outer Mongolian side attributed the cause of the Xinjiang incident to our troops crossing the Outer Mongolian border. When reporters inquired about this with related parties, they were told: "Whether from a historical, geographical, or treaty perspective, Chenghua and the northeastern region of Beitashan are all within China's territory. The Moscow broadcast is completely inconsistent with the facts."

### China-Mongolia Border Demarcation Issue May Be Negotiated in Moscow

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] According to predictions from official sources here, China and the Mongolian People's Republic will face a protracted and unpleasant diplomatic dispute over the demarcation of the northern Xinjiang border where the recent conflict occurred. A Moscow radio broadcast citing a statement from the Outer Mongolian Foreign Minister claimed that Chinese troops crossed into Mongolian territory on June 5th. These remarks presage that the Xinjiang border demarcation issue will go through many complicated negotiations. The negotiation location may be in Moscow. China insists that Beitashan, where the conflict occurred, is 200 miles inside Chinese territory, while the Outer Mongolian side is said to claim that the Chinese border should be moved south of Beitashan. It is said that there are abundant mineral deposits such as coal, gold and uranium there. Officials were very uneasy about Outer Mongolia's demands as stated in the Moscow broadcast. According to them, in the past, when Outer Mongolia was still considered part of China, Beitashan was 200 miles inside Chinese territory according to the Xinjiang provincial border of China. Officials also said that Outer Mongolia has not yet raised this issue with the Chinese Embassy in Moscow. Although China recognizes the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic, it has not yet established diplomatic relations, so any negotiations on this matter must be conducted by diplomatic representatives of China and Mongolia in Moscow. However, Chinese officials predict that in future border negotiations, the Chinese government will insist on the original border lines on the map issued by the Ministry of Interior in 1940 (six years before the recognition of Outer Mongolia's independence).

[Local News] The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Youth Construction Association sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang regarding the Xinjiang incident, stating, "Outer Mongolia recklessly raises troops, and all of us Chinese are furious. Please quickly pacify them to secure the country."

### Foreign Minister Wang's Opening Address: Rapid Economic Recovery as a Condition for Peace and Victory; China is Willing to Assist the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East to Succeed

Mr. Wovwen, distinguished representatives:

The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is an important organization of the United Nations. I feel very honored to have the opportunity to speak here today, because this is the first time that a meeting of this nature has been held in China.

First of all, I would like to welcome all of you on behalf of the Chinese government. I also assure you that the Chinese government will do its best to assist you. I believe that all of you share the common aspiration to ensure the successful completion of this committee's important mission. The Chinese government is happy to see the realization of this aspiration, needless to say.

The establishment of this committee was based on the resolutions passed by the Council in December of last year. One of these resolutions entrusted this committee to "initiate and participate in various measures to facilitate the concentration of efforts to facilitate the reconstruction of the economies of Asia and the Far East, to raise the level of economic activity in Asia and the Far East, to maintain and strengthen relations between the members of the region and between the region and the rest of the world."

From this, it can be seen that the task of this committee is broad in scope, yet also very clear. Your responsibilities are of utmost importance, and the issues you will deal with are also very urgent. As you discuss the rules of procedure and work plans here, hundreds of millions of displaced people are watching how you will design and decide. You will never let them down, because it is through their sacrifices that we have won the victory in the war. Only with their support can we achieve a victory of peace, and a rapid economic recovery is a condition for a victory of peace.

A year and ten months have passed since the Allied nations defeated Japan, but the dawn of global economic recovery has yet to appear. If the situation is like this throughout the world, it is especially so in Asia and the Far East.

Speaking of China, I would like to say frankly that we are still suffering from the severe threat of inflation and price volatility, just as we were during the war. Our ruined cities and ruined rural areas have not yet started reconstruction work. Our limited transportation lines have not been largely restored, and our overall production capacity has not been improved.

The delay in China's economic recovery is due to many reasons. Among these reasons, the vastness of the war-affected areas is the main reason. Most of the effort and time required for economic rehabilitation work depend on this. Since the situation is such, the wounds inflicted on China by our common enemy continue to bleed. The fundamental mission of the United Nations is to promote international peace and security. As for promoting world peace, the Charter of the United Nations has clearly recognized the creation of good economic conditions. Gentlemen, if world peace and world economic stability are inseparable, then the political stability of every war-torn country is also inseparable from the work of economic recovery. These two things are mutually causal and must go hand in hand. Currently, there are many regions within China that not only urgently need economic recovery work, but also have the potential to implement it. The same situation exists in other countries in Asia and the Far East. The economic recovery work in these regions should not wait until the political situation in their countries returns to normal before starting.

The "Working Group on Asia and the Far East" dispatched by the "Temporary Sub-Committee on Economic Reconstruction in War-Torn Areas" has expressed the view that the restoration of the global economic situation requires the cooperation of all relevant governments. This is a very honest and correct view. The victory of the last World War could not have been achieved by the power of one country alone. It is equally impossible for a country to lock itself within its borders and enjoy economic stability alone. Therefore, we must unite, formulate plans, and put the formulated plans into practice.

The Chinese side is prepared to assist in all the investigative work of this committee. We hope that this committee will draw up temporary emergency relief plans for the most affected areas, and formulate long-term reconstruction plans. China will also contribute as much as possible and cooperate fully to ensure the committee's genuine success. We want this committee to benefit Asia, the Far East, and even all the peoples of the world, and thereby enhance the authority of the United Nations itself.

I hope and believe that this committee will fulfill its responsibilities well, and a new and most important page will be added to the record of the United Nations.

### Wovwen's Opening Address

In his opening address, Wovwen stated: The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is holding its first meeting in Asia. I deeply feel the historical importance of this meeting. On behalf of Secretary-General Lie of the United Nations, I extend my greetings to the representatives of all countries. The various issues to be reviewed at this meeting are related to the post-war economic recovery of more than half of the world's population. The main issue before this committee is to study how Asian countries can restore their pre-war economic vitality. Therefore, in reviewing various proposals, it seems inappropriate to make the scope of research too broad, wasting effort and failing to achieve practical results. If this committee can use the importance of each issue as a standard for evaluation, it will not be difficult to establish practical plans in a short period of time, and make all parties recognize that this committee is an organization based on practical work.

### Election of Chairman: A Scene of Debate; Soviet Representative's Dissenting Views Unsupported

When the conference followed the second item on the agenda to elect a chairman yesterday morning, Nehru, the representative of India, first nominated Dr. Chiang Ting-fu as the first chairman. He also said, "Dr. Chiang has experience in our current work, and his advice and guidance will certainly help us establish a strong and effective organization. If we accept his leadership, our task will be much easier."

However, Soviet representative Stetsenko expressed dissent immediately after Mr. Nehru's speech. He said: "I propose that the election of the chairman should be determined only after the representatives of all countries have delivered their speeches. The Soviet delegation only arrived in Shanghai yesterday (referring to the day before yesterday) afternoon, and has not had sufficient time to consider the candidates for chairman. Therefore, I request that the election be postponed."

But U.S. representative Davis expressed support for Nehru's nomination. In addition to supporting the nomination of Chiang Ting-fu by the Indian representative, he also gave a detailed explanation of Mr. Chiang's extraordinary qualifications for this position.

After Mr. Davis finished speaking, Stetsenko still insisted that the election be postponed, repeatedly stating his views. As the time had exceeded 12:00 PM, the temporary chairman Wovwen announced that the discussion would continue at 3:00 PM.

After the afternoon meeting began, the chairman reported that the conference chairman had been nominated by the Indian representative and seconded by the U.S. representative. Just as the matter was about to be put to a vote, Mr. Stetsenko spoke again, insisting that the representatives of the various countries speak first, and then the election be held. Afterwards, Filipino representative Cuaderno proposed that the discussion be terminated, and the chairman put Mr. Stetsenko's proposal to a vote, but no one seconded it. The chairman announced that Dr. Chiang Ting-fu would serve as the chairman of the conference, and then retired to the left of the chairman's seat, allowing Mr. Chiang to formally take his place.

### Soviet Representative: Many Unique Dissenting Views

After Chairman Chiang Ting-fu delivered his opening address at the conference yesterday afternoon, the third item on the agenda, regarding temporary rules of procedure, was discussed. British representative Crow suggested that the committee study and review the rules before submitting them to the conference for approval. At this time, Stetsenko again said: "I do not oppose the British representative's suggestion, but with regards to the fourth item, 'Election of Conference Officers,' I believe that it should not be as rushed and hasty as the previous election of the chairman. We should have time to consider it, so I suggest that the discussion be postponed."

When discussing the fourth item, Mr. Stetsenko once again proposed the idea of speaking first and then discussing it. He asked the chairman in an angry tone: "Do the Soviet representatives have equal rights with other representatives to express their opinions on proposals? Who should decide on the proposal? I would like the chairman to explain."

The chairman laughed and said: "I have no intention of deciding on any proposal. As the chairman of the meeting, my responsibility is to ensure that no representative feels that they have suffered a loss." Mr. Stetsenko replied: "I and the delegation from my country have indeed suffered a loss in the election of the chairman!"

Regarding the election of the conference officers, because several representatives also proposed discussing it today (the 17th), and the time was already past 5:00 PM, the chairman announced that the meeting would continue tomorrow morning and asked the representatives what time would be appropriate. Should the meeting be scheduled for 10:00 AM? But Mr. Stetsenko argued for 10:30 AM. It was then decided that the meeting would be held at 10:30 AM this morning.

### Mayor Wu Hosts Reception to Welcome Economic Commission Representatives

[Report from this city] Mayor Wu Kuo-chen and his wife hosted a cocktail reception at the French Club on Maoming South Road on the evening of the 16th to welcome representatives from various countries to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, along with prominent Chinese and foreign figures, diplomatic envoys, and U.S. Army and Navy officers stationed in Shanghai. Around two hundred people attended, including Wovwen, Wang Shih-chieh, Hepburn, Shen Gong-zhan, Yen Hui-ching, Wang Hsiao-lai, and Chennault. Guests and hosts mingled and enjoyed themselves, and the reception ended around 8 PM.

### Soviet Aircraft Brings Soviet Representatives

[Report from this city] At 5 PM on the afternoon of the 15th, a Soviet aircraft landed at this city's Soviet airfield. This was the first time a Soviet aircraft has come to Shanghai after the war. The aircraft, owned by the China-Soviet Aviation Corporation, transported Soviet representative Stetsenko and his party from Nanjing to Shanghai to attend the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East meeting.

### French Bank to Invest in Sichuan Province; Scope of Loans Already Determined

[Report from Chengdu by this newspaper on the 16th] Mr. Bensard, the representative of the French banking group investing in and assisting Sichuan Province's economic construction, arrived in Chengdu on the 29th of last month and consulted with the provincial and municipal authorities. After several days of thorough study, the scope of loan investment has now been determined: (1) Invest 6 billion yuan to repair the Chengdu trolleybus system. (2) Invest 50 billion yuan to complete the entire Chengdu waterworks project. (3) Invest in the construction of the Chengdu-Guanxian light rail or long-distance trolleybus. (4) Improve the production of Sichuan salt in Zigong and Sichuan sugar in Zizhong, and assist with scientific and technical methods to promote its high degree of industrialization.

The loan agreement will be signed after his trip to Nanjing.

### Sichuan Province's Conscription Quota for This Year: 58,000; Approved Extension to Begin Next Month

[Report from Chengdu by this newspaper on the 16th] Sichuan Province's conscription quota for this year has been clearly determined by the central government as 58,000, and the Ministry of National Defense has ordered the Sichuan Military District to begin conscription on the 1st of this month. However, as it is currently the busy farming season, and preparations have been insufficient, the Sichuan Provincial Government has submitted a request to Chairman Chiang for an extension. Each military district will convene a conscription meeting separately within this month to step up various preparations.

### Suzhou Baoshan Coal Mine: Decision Made on Sealing Measures

Mines No. 2 and No. 5 will be sealed immediately. (2) Dismissal of Workers: The existing miners will be properly compensated for their dismissal by the company in consultation with representatives of the workers. The plan will be submitted to the county, and a meeting will be held again on the 20th to make a decision.

In addition to the security brigades searching for and suppressing the bandits, it is reported that two undercover bandits from the 35th Detachment have been captured in Zhenhai city. According to a spokesman for the Provincial Security Command, there are only about twenty of them, and they are engaged in political propaganda, posing no military threat.

In his welcome address, Mayor Wu said: "As early as two months ago, when we learned that the United Nations would convene the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East meeting in Shanghai, we were extremely pleased to welcome you. Today, I extend my congratulations for the success of the meeting in my capacity as Mayor of Shanghai. Shanghai is a major city in the Far East. It has been devastated by the enemy for eight years and has not yet fully recovered. Since I took office in Shanghai, I have emphasized economic recovery. Shanghai is considered an international metropolis in the Far East and is the center of transportation and industry for the entire country, making it an ideal place to convene the meeting. If we wish to expand international economic cooperation, we must achieve the goal of 'All Under Heaven is One Family'. I sincerely hope that this meeting can further promote global cooperation."

### Resolving Economic Problems is Essential to Avert Political Difficulties: Chiang Ting-fu Delivers Speech After Election as Chairman

Yesterday, Mr. Chiang Ting-fu, upon being elected Chairman of the Far East Economic Commission, expressed his gratitude to the representatives of various nations. He also delivered a speech as follows:

On March 3rd of this year, the Chairman of the Asian and Far Eastern Working Group of the Economic Council submitted a detailed analytical report, based on which the Asian and Far East Economic Commission was established. Although the report at the time could not encompass every detail, its viewpoint accurately captured the economic issues of Asia and the Far East. More importantly, the report pointed out that the economic maladies of Asia and the Far East were already quite prominent before the war. The points raised in that report are still worth reading today. For example, the report stated: "We must recognize that the revival of Asia and the Far East should not be narrowly predicated on restoring the pre-war state. Before the war, industrial development in Asia was merely a superficial embellishment, concealing outdated social structures. While there were new factories, mines, and modern cities, railways, and airports in various places, the general population continued to survive in extreme poverty and ignorance. This has led to the so-called 'dualistic' economic structure in various parts of Asia, where a portion of the population is engaged in modern production, while the majority struggles to survive using non-industrialized means."

The report further pointed out that "the progress of production and trade in Asia and the Far East is a major prerequisite for raising the global standard of living. If the world's nations can assist in Asia's recovery, its productivity and consumption will benefit the recovery of all nations." The points made in the report provide a basis for our examination. In my observation, the political situation in certain regions of Asia is the biggest obstacle to economic recovery. However, the political disputes, if one examines their causes and effects, are merely superficial problems. The main cause of political conflict is still the poverty of the people and nations. Under conditions of hunger and poverty, political stability is difficult to achieve. The general population of Asia is mostly unconcerned with political ideologies and doctrines. Their primary concern is the realistic issue of "clothing, food, and shelter." The interest of the common people in political doctrines is largely based on the issues of "clothing, food, and shelter." Therefore, if there is no solution to economic problems, political difficulties will inevitably increase. Although industrial production in various parts of Asia and the Far East is currently far behind that of other regions, modern methods of production have already given the people of Asia a new enlightenment. The industrial revolution is already underway in various parts of Asia. While governments can do their best to promote this industrial revolution, this commission, if it can provide timely assistance, can further accelerate this industrial recovery.

In the past Chinese society, those in leadership positions were all so-called intellectuals. For two thousand years, this scholar class largely detached themselves from realistic production and trade issues, and devoted all their energy to the study of literature. As a result, while the Chinese scholar class established great literature, art, and philosophy, they made no practical contributions to agriculture, industry, mining, economics, finance, and other issues. In recent decades, the Chinese intellectual class has gradually abandoned the purely scholarly life and sought to solve current realistic problems. This phenomenon can be called a major revolution in history. At the same time, in terms of social relations, the Chinese people have also acquired a new concept in recent years. In terms of economic systems, China has now adopted a mixed economic system, allowing state-owned enterprises and commercial enterprises to coexist harmoniously. This mixed economic system is necessary under the current circumstances. Certain industries, such as railways, electricity, and arms manufacturing, require government investment to compensate for the inadequacy of private capital. Another major reason for China's adoption of a mixed state-owned and commercial economic system is to prevent the vast amount of natural resources from being controlled by a few people.

Although this commission does not participate in actual reconstruction work, our work and recommendations will affect more than half of the world's population. This conference is truly a historic undertaking.

### Severe Flooding in Various Parts of Guangdong, One Million People Homeless; Continuous Rain in Guangxi Creates Disaster

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] Due to continuous rain, various parts of Guangdong have suffered from flooding, with torrents erupting. Most of the flood prevention dikes along the East, West, and North Rivers have collapsed, and the rest are in imminent danger. Villagers are sounding gongs day and night to rescue them. Although the weather cleared up starting from the 15th, only the water level of the East River has receded slightly. The West and North Rivers are still rising without receding. It is estimated that the number of homeless disaster victims is close to one million, and the losses of farmers' livestock are impossible to estimate. Director Zhang Fakui of the Executive Headquarters and Chairman Luo Zhuoying of the Provincial Government are very concerned about the disaster and have convened relevant agencies for discussions in recent days. It has been decided that the Disaster Relief Sub-Bureau will allocate more than 300 tons of rice for emergency relief. Director Zhang is paying particular attention to local security after the disaster. As for the Yingde and Shaoguan bridges on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, which were washed away, the Railway Bureau has been dispatching a large number of employees to actively repair them every day. Director Du Zhenyuan personally went to the construction site to supervise the repairs, ordering that all of them be repaired and reopened to traffic by the 20th of this month.

[Our Guilin Dispatch, 16th] Continuous heavy rain in the entire province of Guangxi has turned the counties along the rivers into vast expanses of water. A disaster has already formed, and the number of disaster victims cannot be counted. All the bridges on the highways have been washed away by floods, and transportation is blocked, making it impossible to transport relief supplies. The situation in the affected counties is extremely serious. In addition, typhoid fever is prevalent in Guilin, with a considerable number of patients.

Editorial

### US Approves Treaties with Four European Nations

President Truman yesterday signed the ratification of the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria and issued a statement. Regarding the treaty with Italy, he stated: "Certain clauses of the treaty are not entirely in accordance with our wishes, and may be amended through the United Nations if necessary in the future. The ratification of the treaty with Italy has brought an end to an unpleasant chapter in Italian-American relations. At the same time, Italy has entered a new era, allowing its people to look forward with hope and confidence... The United States is pleased to stand by Italy as its people rebuild their democracy and restore their freedom in adversity, and the American people are determined to continue to assist the Italian people." However, President Truman's wording was different regarding Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria: "I believe it is necessary to publicly express regret over the fact that the governments of these three countries have disregarded the will of the majority of the people and engaged in suppressing public opinion. Since these three countries were liberated and the Yalta Agreement was established by the three powers, I have hoped that governments truly representing the people could be established in these three countries; but to this day, such governments do not yet exist..." Due to the signing of this ratification, the state of war between the United States and Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria has ended, and the United States' war against these four countries has come to an end.

Now, the treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria have been established, but unfortunately, the establishment of the treaties does not necessarily lead to peace. Europe has just stopped the flames of World War II, but the smell of gunpowder is still shrouding the entire continent. We do not need to mention post-war Germany, but what we should point out is that if the situation currently in post-war Germany is allowed to drag on, the results will undoubtedly negate the gains of this war. Delay is unfavorable. The reason for the delay indicates a lack of policy on one side and a plan on the other; delay is their plan. At the time when the US President signed the ratification of the four-nation treaties, we also saw a speech by British Prime Minister Attlee, indicating that any future war is not only a matter of life and death for individuals, but also a matter of life and death for the entire culture. Although this speech was made in support of the United Nations, its significance is profound; and what is even more worthy of our careful consideration is that while President Truman was signing the ratification of the four-nation treaties, the British Prime Minister delivered this warning speech. Perhaps this can be said to be a kind of irony on the treaties themselves. The treaties have just been signed, but future wars have become the subject of politicians' speeches; if this is not an irony, what is?

In reality, the situation in Europe is too turbulent, and the struggle is too sharp. The coup in Hungary resulted in the creation of a pro-Soviet regime. In Romania and Bulgaria, the situation cannot continue like this for long. Under the coercion of powerful neighbors, Romania and Bulgaria will inevitably produce pro-Soviet governments and become truly vassal states. Romania had once brewed a coup, and the reason why further developments did not occur was probably because of the events in Hungary. Looking at the recent talk of a so-called Balkan Federation, the entire Balkans will be in danger of being swept away. Indeed, in the current situation, the so-called Balkan Federation has somewhat of a psychological warfare effect, with the aim of offsetting the Truman Doctrine and its assistance to Greece. However, what we want to raise the world's awareness of here is that the proposal of this kind of call is less of a psychological warfare attack and more of a probe of strength. The key lies in what policies President Truman will adopt towards Europe in the future, and whether he is prepared to engage in a contest of strength. The situation in Hungary also has the same meaning of a probe. Now a pro-Soviet regime has been established in Hungary, and the Anglo-American note on the situation in Hungary has also been rejected by the Soviet Union. The steps taken by the United Kingdom and the United States regarding the situation in Hungary in the future are really important. If there is no demonstration of strength, the future of the entire Balkans, and even the entire Europe, is truly worrying.

This is why we see President Truman frequently sending overtures to post-war Italy. In his statement on Italy after signing the four-nation treaties, his attitude was tactful and his affection was strong, which was distinctly different from his statement on Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. In the days when almost all of Eastern Europe has been swept away by the Soviet Union, Italy has become the vanguard of Western Europe. The US defense line is no longer in the Atlantic, no longer in the Rhine, but has extended to the Adriatic Sea, extending eastward to the east of the Aegean Sea. In order to protect this defense line, the United States must win over Italy and can no longer allow Italy to become a second Poland. Therefore, when signing the ratification of the treaty with Italy, President Truman indicated that the treaty could be amended as needed through the United Nations. However, what immediately follows the establishment of the treaty with Italy is the issue of realistic politics. Within ninety days after the treaty with Italy takes effect, all British troops stationed in Italy will withdraw, and the United Kingdom and Italy have already reached an agreement on this matter, exchanging notes yesterday. What we are worried about is that Italy's own military equipment is extremely pitiful, and the situation will be even more difficult to control after the US troops withdraw. Tito is eyeing it covetously from behind, and the Soviet Union maintains a strong military force in Europe. How will Italy handle itself?

In short, due to the signing of this ratification of the four-nation treaties, the state of war between the United States and Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria has ended, but there is still a considerable distance to go before peace is achieved. We do not yet see a prospect for peace; this can at best be called a truce. After this devastating war, how to rebuild world peace is a matter of hoping for the good efforts of politicians from all countries.

### The Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe Will Face an Important Test; The Hungarian Coup Created a Difficult Situation; There Seems to Be a Contradiction Between the Plan and the Truman Doctrine

[Reuters, London, 15th] The Soviet Union's formal rejection this weekend of the US protest over Soviet policy in Hungary, as well as the UK's request for information on the matter, has again created tensions between the Soviet Union and Western countries. The political role of Secretary of State Marshall's "Continental Plan" for Aid to Europe will soon be put to the test. The main point of conflict between the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine is that the former advocates including the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries in its Continental Plan, while the Truman Doctrine advocates never supporting communist governments with US dollars. This conflict has not yet been formally presented to the public. However, the development of the situation in Hungary, as well as the Soviet Union's clear intention not to give up its influence in Eastern Europe, has made it impossible to ignore the former conflict any longer. If the Soviet Union maintains a firm attitude towards the situation in Hungary, US economic aid will either be provided regardless of the political tendencies of the victims, or it will not be provided to countries within the Soviet sphere of influence. Therefore, the unresolved question is whether Marshall's economic aid proposal has political conditions attached. General Sviridov, the Soviet chairman of the Allied Control Commission in Hungary, replied to the US protest, and the Moscow-released communiqué of the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Ambassador Peterson, showed that the Soviet Union still felt resentful about the suspicion of the British and Americans that the Hungarian coup was a manufactured incident. Both documents also showed that the Soviet Union would continue not to allow other occupying powers to learn of the evidence that led to the resignation of former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy and others. It is said that Foreign Minister Molotov may have informed British Ambassador Peterson that there would be some amendments to the Soviet Union's position, but as of yet, the Foreign Office has not received a report that Molotov had first requested another meeting with the British ambassador last Friday. Moreover, the recent Soviet statement was issued more than 24 hours after the former rumor occurred, which proves that even if the former statement is true, it will not fundamentally change the Soviet Union's position. It is expected that the main issue that Foreign Secretary Bevin will discuss with French Foreign Minister Bidault in Paris next Tuesday will be the issue of whether the US aid proposal may have political conditions attached.

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] It was learned today that Secretary of State Marshall and his senior advisors have now formulated a plan to deal with the chaos in Europe and the growing threat of communism, either to unify most of the continent by the end of the year, or to make it more divided than before, regardless of the Soviet Union's reaction. According to diplomatic officials, if the Soviet Union resolutely refuses to cooperate, it will undoubtedly force Western Europe to form an economic federation on its own, meaning that the Soviet Union and its Eastern European bloc will be deprived of practical US aid. It is said that Marshall hopes this will not happen, and that the Soviet Union will eventually cooperate, or at least allow some of the countries it rules to cooperate with the US proposal to form some kind of European economic federation. Marshall's policy is clearly a "open door" policy that welcomes Soviet cooperation. If the door is closed, it must be by the Soviet side. However, it is considered that the possibility of the Soviet Union closing this door is very high, which can be seen from the speech of Deputy Secretary of State Acheson yesterday.

### British Foreign Secretary to Fly to France Today to Discuss European Economic Recovery; British Government to Consult with the Soviet Union

[Our Report] London, 16th broadcast: Bevin is scheduled to fly to Paris tomorrow to discuss the entire plan for the revitalization of Europe proposed by Marshall with Bidault. At the same time, Bevin also stated that he will negotiate with the Soviet Union on the same issue, but Hua has expressed no interest. The communist newspaper "Pravda" criticized Marshall's proposal, saying that it was only a means for the United States to expand the Truman Doctrine.

[Associated Press, London, 16th] A Foreign Office spokesman announced today: Regarding US Secretary of State Marshall's plan for aid to Europe, the United Kingdom will directly consult with the Soviet Union. Initial contact will follow normal diplomatic channels. Foreign Secretary Bevin is currently in Paris to discuss the US plan to revitalize Europe tomorrow, but there is no news of whether he will personally go to Moscow. In addition, France has consulted the Soviet Union on its views on the US aid plan for Europe.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] Well-informed sources here have recently said that the British House of Commons is scheduled to debate foreign policy on the 19th, at which time the attitude that the United Kingdom should take towards Secretary of State Marshall's European cooperation plan will be the theme of the debate. Former Foreign Secretary Eden will also attend and speak on behalf of the opposition. Political figures here are now paying close attention to the speech to be delivered by Foreign Secretary Bevin, as Foreign Secretary Bevin will have already held talks with French Prime Minister Ramadier and Foreign Minister Bidault at that time, so it must be of great significance. In addition, it is expected that Colonial Secretary Jones will also make an important speech, explaining the United Kingdom's development policy for its African territories, especially the Gold Coast and Nigeria. In addition, the German issue will also be brought up for debate, to confirm the tendency of British officials to avoid a stalemate with the Soviet Union on this issue.

His investigation shows that the money spent by the United States in assisting the reconstruction of the shattered post-war world is more than 20 billion US dollars.

Other surplus materials and UNRRA relief goods amounted to millions of awards. Henna also listed the special assistance of 695 million US dollars approved by Congress for the Republic of the Philippines, including 400 million US dollars paid for private war loss claims.

### US-Soviet War Can Be Avoided: Jackson's Observation

[Agence France-Presse, Hanover, New Hampshire, 16th] US Supreme Court Justice, former Nuremberg Tribunal Prosecutor Jackson, speaking to Dartmouth University students last night, said that the Soviet Union wants to do everything possible to avoid war with the United States, and that it is completely wrong to say that war is inevitable. The friction between the two countries today is mostly due to the fact that both sides want to expand their sphere of influence.

### Soviet Radio Broadcasts Pravda Commentary Criticizing US Policy Towards Europe; Says the Marshall Plan is Actually the Truman Doctrine

[United Press International, London, 16th] Regarding the US aid plan for Europe, Moscow Radio broadcast a commentary from Pravda stating: "Marshall's plan, although seemingly novel, is actually just a repetition of Truman's policy of using US dollars to aid other countries and regain political power to interfere in their internal affairs. The United States will inevitably have such cries after eliminating its internal conspiracy in any country such as Hungary. The Marshall Plan, in its wording, deliberately makes it different from the Truman Doctrine, just to cover people's ears and eyes." The Moscow broadcast: "Marshall said at a press conference on June 12 that his plan for European economic recovery refers to all European countries, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and other European countries, but this is obviously contradictory to the US policy towards Eastern Europe. The purpose is nothing more than to deceive the American people by saying that the US plan was originally intended to be treated equally, but the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries themselves are unwilling to accept the conditions of US "aid." The true essence of the Marshall Plan is to openly endorse the European Federation launched by Churchill. Everything proves the significance of the US "aid" policy and has not changed."

### If the Soviet Union Wants to Seize Middle East Oil Fields, the US Will Resort to War: Wallace Said at a Press Conference

[United Press International, Washington, 15th] Wallace said at a press conference on the 15th that if the Soviet Union's expansion reaches the point where it can seize the oil fields of Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and the United States "should" resort to war. Later, Wallace added that his remarks might be misunderstood as being "hawkish," so he changed the phrase "should" resort to war to "will" resort to war. Wallace pointed to Turkey as the "king" in the great powers' "chess game," and the Soviet Union should know that up to Turkey, the Soviet Union cannot move forward without causing war. The US Navy will fight to defend the oil fields of Saudi Arabia. He believes that if the Soviet Union's current western border is further expanded, it would be "unwise" for the Soviet Union. When asked if the Soviet Union had "seized" Hungary, Wallace scoffed at it and said that if it is said that the Soviet Union intends to "seize" Hungary, then it can also be said that the United States intends to "seize" Greece by means of Truman's aid plan to Greece.

### Philippines Strives to Expand its Military

[United Press International, Manila, 16th] The Republic of the Philippines has reached its first week of establishment and is working hard to expand its small, US-trained military into a strong force.

### Europe to Hold Round Table Conference to Discuss US Aid to Europe Plan; Soviet Reaction of Great Importance

[United Press International, London, 15th] Diplomatic circles here predict that European countries may hold a round table conference within the next month to discuss economic cooperation methods based on the Marshall Plan for US aid to Europe. Countries vying to take advantage of the US suggestion for Europe may hold a round table conference in July. The reasons are based on the following two rapid developments: (1) Foreign Minister Bevin has declared that he will fly to Paris on the 17th to hold preliminary discussions with Prime Minister Ramadier and Foreign Minister Bidault, and may stay for two days. (2) France has invited the Soviet Union to exchange views on the American plan. The Soviet Union's reaction to this plan is of great importance. London diplomatic circles believe that although the US and the Soviet Union have disputes over the development of the Balkans, the Soviet Union may accept the Marshall Plan. Stalin has repeatedly told people that he would welcome US economic assistance. It is claimed that if the Soviet Union accepts Marshall's suggestion, the application of the Truman Doctrine in Europe will automatically be cancelled.

### The Soviet Union Replies with a Counter-Argument; The US Government Finds it Difficult to Accept; Hungarians Feel Surprised and Uneasy

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] A State Department spokesman recently stated that as of 11 p.m. last night, Mr. Weems, the US representative to the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, had not yet received a reply from General Sviridov, the Soviet chairman of the commission, rejecting the investigation of the Hungarian political situation. Washington has naturally not received it either, so it is difficult to comment. Semi-official sources say that if the content of the note is the same as reported in the newspapers, then the United States will find it difficult to accept. The Soviet Union is encouraging the new communist faction politician in Hungary, Fiffa, to seize power and instead accuses the United States of sheltering members of the collapsed government, which is playing with fire. The United States has always supported fair elections in Hungary, hence this action. If the United Nations investigation committee is established in the future, the Soviet Union will be forced to present evidence of those accused of participating in the conspiracy. In short, this matter is subtle, and the final course of action can only be decided by President Truman or Secretary of State Acheson.

[Reuters, Budapest, 15th] After the publication of the American note accusing the Soviet Union of interfering in Hungarian internal affairs, and the article by General Sviridov, the Soviet chairman of the Allied Control Commission, the Hungarian reaction can be divided into two categories: surprise and unease. Those who were surprised were surprised by General Sviridov's statement that the Hungarian National Assembly had unanimously passed a vote of confidence in the new government, because in fact no such vote had yet taken place. Judging from the opposition leader's remarks last week, it is unlikely that there will be unanimous support when the vote is taken. What makes Hungarians uneasy is the American note's statement that "if a satisfactory response is not received, we will take other actions." At the same time, Hungarian Justice Minister Ries has ordered the prosecutor's office to file a complaint with the People's Court against former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy and National Assembly Speaker Dejlga, which is contrary to Hungarian legal principles, because Hungarian law stipulates that the actions of the Prime Minister while in office can only be tried by the State Committee.

### Austrian President States Determination to Uphold Democracy

[United Press International, Vienna, 16th] Austrian President Renner said that Austrian democracy cannot be overthrown by political advancements supported by foreign countries. However, President Wu admitted that the Austrian Communist Party has ambitious plans, but they can only obtain the power they deserve through elections.

### Content of Soviet Reply: Rejects British and American Suggestions

[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 15th] Regarding the American note of the 11th of this month to General Sviridov, the Soviet representative and chairman of the Allied Control Commission for Hungary, requesting the organization of a British, American, and Soviet tripartite committee to investigate the Hungarian political situation, it has been learned that Sviridov replied to General James, the American representative, today, categorically rejecting the American request. The reply stated: "I do not believe that there has been any violation of the Yalta Agreement in the recent events in Hungary. Your country's protest is completely unfounded, so I must reject it. Your country's claim that the Soviet Union is interfering in Hungarian internal affairs is also a fabrication. Therefore, I find it difficult to accept the suggestion of a joint British, American, and Soviet investigation of the Hungarian political situation, and I do not think it is necessary. I believe that this action will interfere in Hungarian internal affairs and is unacceptable. The recent coup in Hungary was caused by the former prime minister's refusal to heed the opinions of the cabinet. The current situation has been resolved by the Hungarian parliament in accordance with constitutional procedures, and the parliament has expressed its trust in the new government and has granted it full power. These facts are undoubtedly well known to your country. The note recently submitted by your country, under the guise of assisting Hungarian democracy, is in fact an attempt to assist certain individuals who have been involved in conspiracies, which cannot be denied. Regarding the records of the interrogation of Kovacs, the secretary-general of the Hungarian Smallholders' Party, I do not believe that I have an obligation to forward these documents to the British and American representatives in Hungary. These documents have been sent to the Hungarian government because they are only related to the Hungarian government."

### British and American Authorities in Germany Permit the Opening of German Import and Export Businesses; Permanent Economic Committee to Be Established in Soviet-Occupied Zone

[United Press International, Berlin, 15th] The British and American military governments in Germany have permitted the opening of German import and export commerce so that the economically merged British and American occupation zones can become self-sufficient. The US military authorities announced that three important agreements were reached last week, and another negotiation is scheduled to begin this week, so that Germany can export US$2 billion worth of goods in 1950. This goal cannot be achieved before 1950, because it is necessary to import raw materials from many countries first. Import business has already started smoothly. The agreements reached last week include: (1) A Swiss delegation signed an export agreement with representatives of the British and American zones in Berlin on the 11th, stipulating that Swiss importers can directly negotiate with German exporters in the British and American occupation zones. (2) British and American authorities have approved a US$13.17 million Bavarian export plan, including pencils worth US$6 million, toys worth US$5 million, and X-ray and dental equipment worth US$2 million. (3) The British and American authorities have reached an agreement in principle to organize an institution to handle imports, provide funds, and purchase American cotton and textiles. An Italian commercial delegation will go to Berlin this week to begin negotiations with the British and American authorities.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 15th] The German News Agency published today an order signed by Marshal Sokolovsky, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet occupation forces, announcing that the Soviet military government has transferred its economic administrative power to the German Central Affairs Bureau in the Soviet occupation zone. Previously, the bureau only provided advice in an advisory capacity. Marshal Sokolovsky's order personally designated the organization of a permanent economic committee composed of the heads of the industrial bureau, transportation bureau, fuel bureau, electricity bureau, agriculture bureau, commerce bureau, and food bureau of the German Central Administrative Agency, the leaders of trade unions in the Soviet occupation zone, and the head of the "Peasant Relief Organization." According to observers, this Soviet action is similar to the recent establishment of an economic committee and executive committee by the British and American occupation authorities.

### 200,000 Seamen on the US East Coast Go on Slowdown; Transportation at Major Ports Comes to a Halt

[United Press International, New York, 16th] Two hundred thousand maritime workers on the US East Coast implemented a slowdown on ships on the 16th, so transportation at major seaports in the United States has come to a halt. The current maritime contract expired at midnight on the 15th, and the National Maritime Union is leading the "No Contract, No Work" movement with the support of four other "trade" unions. Shore workers are no longer boarding ships, and ship workers have stopped working. The union's tactic is to force the employers to expel the seafarers from the ships, causing the employers to close down due to the dismissal of workers. The union is trying to avoid using the word "strike." According to the union leader's estimate, this move will affect about 1,000 ships in various places. New York will be the first to bear the brunt. According to customs officials, there are currently 220 American ships in New York, of which 102 are under repair. Joseph Curran, president of the National Maritime Union, sent telegrams to various branches at 1:20 a.m. on the 16th, instructing "Do not sign contracts, do not sail ships," but all seafarers should stay on the ships as much as possible. This telegram applies to all chartered foreign coastal and intercontinental ships. The union negotiating committee has been ordered to refuse to extend the current contract if the employers insist on refusing to consider any improvements in wages, working hours, and working conditions. The West Coast Maritime Union is now negotiating separately with West Coast employers, but it is stated that if the East Coast Union cannot win, they will also go on strike.

### Japan Will Possess the Largest Fishing Fleet in History

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to personnel from the Allied Headquarters, once the Allied Headquarters' fishing facility reconstruction plan is realized this autumn, "the fishing fleet will have 821 large wooden fishing boats, 59 large trawlers, and 933 small trawlers. This number is even larger than its pre-war fishing fleet."

### Syngman Rhee Deeply Dissatisfied with US Policy of Appeasement Toward Korean Communists; Conflicting Opinions Within the Korean Independence Party

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 16th broadcast: Korean leader Syngman Rhee told reporters today: "Korea has only one way out. Korea must establish a 100% democratic government, otherwise it can establish a purely communist regime. Any 'mixed' government with some communists participating will never succeed. All that the Joint Committee can do is a compromise. Even the current compromise, 90% follows the opinions of the United States, and the Soviet Union's opinions only account for 10%, but South Korea will eventually be controlled by the communists. Koreans are not divided. The one who created the division is the policy of the United States. The United States implements a policy of purging communists at home, but in Korea, it adopts a policy of appeasement towards the communists, which is unwise."

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 16th] Recently, the activities of various political groups in South Korea have become increasingly tense and complex. Representatives from the left-right cooperation committee and more than a dozen other groups, including Kim Gyu-sik, Lyuh Woon-hyung, Ahn Jae-hong, and Hong Myong-hui, discussed participating in the US-Soviet Joint Committee yesterday and today. Representatives from the various parties under the banner of the Democratic Front also discussed the content of the consultation form. Within the Korean Independence Party, opinions have been divided into two factions. The reformists advocate participation, while the attitude of the chairman and vice-chairman has not yet been stated.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 16th] Since the US-Soviet Joint Committee began issuing consultation forms to various political parties and social groups on the 12th, a total of 190 political parties and social groups have received the consultation forms so far.

### Indian Punjab Province to Conduct Regular Trial of Partition; Congress Party Denies Princely States' Right to Independence

[Agence France-Presse, Lahore, 15th] Although a preliminary agreement on the partition of the province of Punjab has been reached, dozens of arson incidents occurred here on Sunday. It is reported that the preliminary agreement on the partition established in Punjab stipulates that the Allies, Hindus, and Sikhs will divide the province into two parts, east and west, and the trial date has been set for the day after the Punjab Provincial Assembly meets, which is June 24.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 15th] The All India Congress Committee today unanimously passed a resolution of the Congress Working Committee, denying any Indian princely state the right to declare independence on its own and secede from other parts of India. It also expressed the hope that the rulers of the Indian princely states would recognize the current situation of the country and join the Indian Federation for the benefit of the people in their states and throughout India. During the debate, Nehru also stated that any foreign country that recognizes the independence of an Indian princely state will be regarded as an unfriendly act.

### British Officers Train French Troops

[United Press, Algiers, 15th] A British military team consisting of 14 officers and 88 junior officers and soldiers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Barrow, arrived here by British warship today at the invitation of the French government to teach the French army how to use British military equipment and train the French air transport unit.

### Indonesian-Dutch Dispute to Be Submitted to Third-Party Arbitration

[Reuters, Batavia, 15th] Indonesian Republican Minister of Economy, Gani, stated that Indonesia will ask a third country to arbitrate the negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. This action is taken in accordance with the provisions before and after the Linggadjati Agreement. We are still prepared to work for the benefit of this agreement and strive for a peaceful resolution. Gani did not state which country the third country is. Some people believe that Britain may be asked again to help resolve Indonesia's difficulties. Gani also stated that both the Netherlands and Indonesia knew when signing the Linggadjati Agreement that it was a basic agreement, and that the Dutch proposals and the Indonesian counter-proposals were simply their respective interpretations of the agreement. Although the Dutch side has not yet responded to the Indonesian counter-proposals, unofficial sources indicate that the Indonesian counter-memorandum is unfeasible.

### Allied Policy Toward Japan to Be Officially Determined Soon; US Plans to Retain the Right to Appoint Allied Supreme Commander

[United Press International, Washington, 15th] According to authoritative sources, the Far Eastern Commission will pass the "Basic Policy" on post-war policy toward Japan at its meeting on the 19th. The Basic Policy is the result of long-term discussions by the eleven member countries of the committee. In fact, it is only a revision of President Truman's "US Policy Toward Japan." Its purpose is to permanently disarm Japan, promote freedom and democracy, punish war criminals, restore peaceful economic activities, handle reparations, and administer the military government through the Japanese government. In addition to reiterating the above-mentioned purposes, the Far Eastern Commission's decision will also reaffirm a section of the American post-war policy toward Japan, namely that the Allied Supreme Commander stationed in Japan should be another unit appointed by the United States. Some American officials believe that this section should be retained, because MacArthur's position may be replaced by a senior civil affairs commissioner from the United States. If the above-mentioned matter occurs, the United States can arbitrarily appoint it without seeking the full consent of other countries. With the exception of Australia, all countries supported this basic decision at last week's Far Eastern Commission meeting. Australia requested a week to consider certain technical issues. However, the drafting of the Basic Policy was initiated by Australia, and Australia is not expected to hinder the passage of the decision. Some committee members admitted that the policy seems to be outdated, but they believe that it is necessary to formally determine the occupation plan, and most of the occupation plans have already been implemented.

### Welles Broadcast: US Should Strive to Promote the United States of Europe; USSR Has Ambition to Dominate the World

[United Press International, Washington, 15th] Former US Undersecretary of State Welles broadcasted on the 15th that he believes that the United States should do its best to encourage Europe to establish the United States of Europe. The United States should not hesitate to assist Europe in establishing the United States of Europe. He fully agrees with the Truman Doctrine, but believes that "our failure lies in the implementation of this policy, which requires rapid and effective strengthening of the United States' promises, and the issue of time is the most important. Europe is now encountering the most serious crisis since the war. The Soviet leaders have now decided to adopt an aggressive expansion policy to achieve the goal of controlling Europe and the Mediterranean, and ultimately controlling Asia as well. This situation has become increasingly clear since the end of the European war. Similarly, if the Soviet Union's above-mentioned plot succeeds, its power will quickly spread to all parts of the world, including the Western Hemisphere."

### US Establishes Committee to Study Aviation Safety Measures

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] President Truman today appointed five experts to organize an aviation safety investigation committee.

### Day of Reckoning for Two War Criminals; Sins of Blood Are Repaid; One Tiger, One Wolf, Executed This Afternoon; Parade Through the Streets Before Execution

[Report from this newspaper] The Japanese war criminals "Tiger of Jiangyin" Shimoada Jiro (see small picture) and "Wolf of Changshu" Yonemura Haruki (see large picture) were sentenced to death by the Shanghai Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. The sentence was reported to the Chief of Staff and approved by Chairman Chiang. It is scheduled to be executed at the Jiangwan execution ground at 2 pm today.

The military tribunal considered that the two criminals killed countless people during the invasion of China. Their execution will be a cause for great rejoicing. Therefore, before the execution, they will be paraded through the streets to show the public. The route has been determined as follows: Start from the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison, pass through Broadway, Garden Bridge, the Bund, turn into Nanjing Road, pass through the Racecourse, West Nanjing Road to Jing'an Temple, turn through Huashan Road, Central Zhongzheng Road, the Great World, East Zhongzheng Road, Sichuan Road, North Sichuan Road, and go directly to the Jiangwan execution ground. At that time, four motorcycle patrol cars will lead the way, followed by a police car from the Garrison Department, a prison car, a police car with a machine gun, an execution car, and then a red anti-riot police car will bring up the rear. The military tribunal posted announcements on the streets of the city yesterday afternoon to inform the public. When the execution is carried out today, prosecutors Tu Guangjun and Fu Shude will supervise the execution. Li Yechu, the chief clerk of the court, Wang Shuliang, Yuan Qing, and others will go to the execution ground to take care of the arrangements.

Shimoada Jiro is 30 years old and from Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. He was formerly a sergeant in the Jiangyin Japanese Military Police. During the Anti-Japanese War, he captured and killed many comrades of the Anti-Japanese War who were active in the suburbs of Jiangyin. What was especially cruel was that on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival after Japan surrendered to China, he tied up twelve of our compatriots who were being held prisoner in the backyard of the unit, and Shimoada and other Japanese soldiers stabbed them to death with bayonets. Yonemura Haruki is 53 years old and from Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. He was formerly the captain of the Changshu Japanese Military Police. The criminal, in order to seek merit and promotion, carried out unjust prisons on a large scale. Between 1942 and 1943, he arrested more than 50 residents in Changshu, Taicang, and other places under the pretext of searching for Communist bandits. Except for a few who were released, the rest were either tortured to death, buried alive outside the North Gate of Changshu, or sent to the Japanese military court for execution. He was inhumane, and the defendant was therefore promoted from lieutenant to major and awarded medals.

### More Bodies Found from Da Feng Shipwreck; Families Request Expanded Salvage; Shipping Administration Bureau Summons Manager to Discuss Aftermath

The Da Feng Shipping Bureau immediately notified the families of the deceased passengers to go to Zishan by six cars yesterday morning to identify the bodies. It was also reported yesterday that more than 20 bodies were found in the Yangtze River in Taicang County. The Da Feng Shipping Bureau has sent personnel to investigate and confirm the facts before notifying the families to identify the bodies. As for the previous report of 18 bodies found at the seven outlets, the company authorities sent personnel to investigate with the families, but the results did not match. The investigation is currently continuing.

Arbitration Results To Be Released Within Days

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received a long-distance phone call yesterday from the Minister of Transportation in Nanjing stating that the collision between the Fubo and Hai Min vessels will be arbitrated by Minister Bai and Director Chen of the Ministry of National Defense. Efforts are underway to determine responsibility as soon as possible. The company should wait for the arbitration results to be released to determine liability and fulfill its obligations accordingly. Before this, the company has no legal basis to make any representations to the bereaved families. The arbitration committee, jointly formed by the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of the Navy, and the Ministry of Transportation, is currently conducting investigations. The arbitration results may be released within the next few days.

China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Responds: Rejects Demands

[Our Newspaper's Report] Forty-five family members of the officers and soldiers who perished on the Fubo vessel have collectively petitioned the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, demanding temporary relief funds and four other associated requests. After mediation by Municipal Government Advisor Ge Kexin, Deputy General Manager Shen Zhongyi of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company agreed to cover the accommodation costs for the families coming to Shanghai to petition. However, Shen promised to respond to the other four requests yesterday afternoon. When the family representatives received a call from Advisor Ge, they were informed that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would not agree to any of the four requests made by the families. Even the previously raised relief fund of over 5,700 yuan would not be provided. At this point, Mr. Ge declared his withdrawal from mediation. Upon hearing this news, the family members were dissatisfied and decided to make further decisions after today's District Court investigative hearing concludes.

### Liang Xiuyu and Gong Huanfei; The High Procuratorate Files Charges Of Treason; Wang Maoting and Eight Others Also Indicted

### Chen Shaonan Indicted For Malfeasance And Embezzlement; Transferred To District Procuratorate Yesterday For Investigation And Trial

Chen Shaonan, a staff member of the Municipal Government Secretariat, was dismissed and investigated for soliciting business and arranging permits for rickshaws. Details of this have been reported in this newspaper. It has come to light that Chen was originally a staff member of the puppet municipal government named Cheng Xiucen. After the victory, he changed his name and worked in the municipal government. A folding fan with the inscription "Xiucen" was found in his possession, serving as clear evidence. The police transferred Chen and the folding fan, along with 500,000 yuan in embezzled funds, to the District Procuratorate yesterday on charges of embezzlement and malfeasance. The prosecutor opened a court session for investigation, and the defendant gave evasive answers. The court ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Representative Of Industry And Commerce Expresses Grievances; Luo Qinghua Went To Nanjing Last Night

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the announcement of the workers' cost of living index in May, industries and businesses in the city have found it difficult to bear the burden. Three trade associations, the Machine Industry, Electrical Equipment Industry, and Metal Smelting Industry Associations, have written to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting that a city-wide discussion be convened with industrial associations to discuss remedies. After the Chamber of Commerce convened a joint discussion with forty industrial trade associations, the following conclusions were reached: (1) Request the government to restore the year-end salary of 1936; (2) Matters concerning labor-capital assessments and wages should comply with factory regulations; (3) Employers should pay wages based on the previous month's index to allow for cost calculation. Concerning the recent amendments to the Factory Law by the Legislative Yuan, which removed the original draft provisions stating "workers in public transportation cannot strike" and "no wages will be paid during a strike," it was felt that these exceeded the times and were unsuited to the national situation, greatly affecting social production. Therefore, it was necessary to sincerely express these opinions to the central government. Permanent Director Luo Qinghua was specifically delegated to go to Nanjing last night to petition the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and relevant ministries, requesting remedies. Mr. Luo had received a telegram from Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs yesterday morning, possibly in connection with this issue. Mr. Luo will also present the pain that Shanghai industry and commerce feels regarding the profit tax levied by the tax collection office to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the simplified collection method proposed by the Municipal Council be adopted.

### Jinhua Cigarette Factory's Illegal Construction: Considering Workers' Livelihoods, Extension Granted For Relocation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jinhua Cigarette Factory at No. A4, Lane 146, Road 1, is constructed with bamboo frames, making it simple and prone to fire. Furthermore, the area is originally a residential area, and the noise and smoke from the factory have caused great disturbance to nearby residents, who have reported the situation to the police and Public Works Bureau. After investigation by officials, the authorities immediately ordered the factory to relocate according to the law. After receiving the order, the factory once requested a long-term suspension of enforcement from the authorities and then announced its closure, dismissing over a thousand workers. The unemployed workers, with no means of livelihood, went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition.

During his tenure, he committed many evils and was reported. He was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters on April 2nd and transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation yesterday. It is reported that Cai Sen is accused of six major crimes: (1) Looting Huge Sums Of Money Under The Guise Of Searches And Sharing The Spoils: Cai personally led the so-called "Secretary Wang," "Deputy Officer Xu," and over 20 soldiers to surround residences along Hainan Road in the city. Under the guise of searching for military fire and military supplies, they seized 20 packages of silver dollars, then worth 1.5 billion yuan in puppet currency, and 20 motorcycle sidecars, and later distributed 30,000 yuan to each soldier. (2) Harboring The Enemy And Appointing Them As Councilors And Informants: A Japanese businessman feared being sent to a concentration camp, so he was appointed as an informant by the battalion headquarters under a Chinese name in exchange for 100 million yuan. For example, Horita Toshikichi (alias Wang Xiansheng), the political squad leader of the enemy special affairs agency, was appointed to the position of exclusively collecting military rice. and Mr. Shimazu, the owner of Shimazu Trading Company (alias Sun Zhongchen), was appointed as a lieutenant quartermaster of the team in order to avoid attention.

### Postal, Telecommunications, and Train Fare Increases: To Be Implemented In The Near Future

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Post Office, the Telecommunications Bureau, and the Railway Bureau are suffering heavy losses every month and have been relying on state subsidies to maintain operations. The price increases for postage, telegram fees, and railway passenger and freight fares have been brewing for a long time. Recently, it has been rumored that the Ministry of Transportation has approved them. The reporter visited the three bureaus yesterday, and they all stated that they had not received orders from the ministry. However, the principle of price increases has long been agreed upon by the authorities, and the three bureaus have never ceased their efforts to make the price increases a reality. Recently, the gap between commodity prices and the fees charged by state-owned enterprises has become increasingly large, and state subsidies are increasing, which is not a long-term solution. Therefore, price increases are inevitable. Currently, the authorities are only considering the extent of the increase. One source says that July 1 will be the date for the implementation of new prices for railway fares, postage, and telegram fees. Another source says that it will be postponed until the 15th of next month.

According to the Huadong News Agency, the Railway Bureau originally planned to adjust ticket prices starting yesterday, but later received instructions from the Ministry of Transportation to temporarily postpone it until July 1.

### Will Public Utilities Raise Prices Again? To Be Decided At The Price Conference

The reporter visited the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, and according to the person in charge of the bureau, the bureau has not yet received any documents from any agency requesting price increases. However, it is generally estimated that central subsidies for public utilities in the city may be stopped starting next month, as subsidies are not a thorough solution. If central subsidies are stopped, public utilities will inevitably increase prices again, but the magnitude cannot be estimated. Everything must wait for the final decision to be made at the National Price Conference to be held in Nanjing at the end of this month.

### Dong Jiuzhi Indicted For Embezzling Shao's Property As A Traitor: Discrepancy In The Number Of Silver Boxes; Unauthorized Opening Without Approval

[Our Newspaper's Report] Shao Shijun, the director of the puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau, fled after the victory, leaving behind a huge amount of property, which has led to repeated disputes. Previously, Shen Shubao was accused of concealing Shao's property as a traitor. Now, Dong Jiuzhi, the former Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters, has been accused by the Military Statistics Bureau of embezzlement during the takeover. After investigation by the District Procuratorate, he was indicted yesterday for embezzlement. The main points of the indictment are as follows: Defendant Dong Jiuzhi, 40 years old, from Jiaxing, resides in the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League on Jin Shenfu Road. After the enemy surrendered in October 1945, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters borrowed Shao Shijun's residence at No. 80 Aitang Road as an office space. Shao and Jiang Dongrong had already transferred valuable gold jewelry, diamond rings, jewels, and opium to the home of doctor Shen Shubin. What remained in Shao's residence was only furniture, telephones, electric fans, table lamps, safes, and a few paintings and antiques. On August 20, the headquarters appointed former Propaganda Chief Zhuang Hecheng and staff member Zhuang Jie to take over. The next day, Dong Jiuzhi, the Chief of the General Affairs Section, moved in to arrange things. Later, Jiang Dongrong was detained by the Military Statistics Bureau on suspicion of concealing enemy and puppet property. Zhuang Hecheng, Zhuang Jie, Dong Jiuzhi, and others were suspected of embezzling the property of the traitor, and the Military Statistics Bureau transferred the case to the High Procuratorate, ordering the investigation of the embezzlement of the property of the traitor and the opium smoking of Jiang Dongrong. According to the defendant Dong Jiuzhi, although he did not admit to embezzling the property of the traitor, it was found that the inventory list of furniture left in Shao's residence included three small silver boxes and one large silver box, a total of four boxes. Later, the Military Statistics Bureau, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Songhu Garrison Command, sent personnel to Shao's residence for inspection and found that there were actually five safes. Furthermore, the defendant opened the safes without authorization without reporting it. This is an indisputable fact for the defendant. The claim that one in the barbershop had already been opened, and two that had been opened under the stairs and in the passageway were empty, but after inspection by the Military Statistics Bureau, one in the barbershop had a small drawer that had been pried open with the butt of a 77mm gun. The traces were also identified on the spot as matching the 77mm gun butt used by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters Armed Guard. Although the number of valuables reported lost by Jiang Dongrong cannot be proven, it was found that there were still more than 500 Japanese, Manchurian, and puppet banknotes, 30 puppet tax bureau account books, and 8 tax guarantee certificates in the two unopened safes opened by the Military Statistics Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters. It cannot be claimed that there were no items left in the opened box. The defendant's behavior is beyond question, and it is difficult to say that there is no suspicion of embezzlement. The defendant's actions violate Article 1, Paragraph 1, and Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Anti-Corruption Regulations, and he should be prosecuted according to the law."

The other defendants in the same case, Zhuang Hecheng and Zhuang Jie, were not indicted due to insufficient evidence.

### Aftermath Of The Fuxing Island Case: Jin Zhensheng And His Father Accuse Liu Gu of Extortion; Defendant Ticketed For Shoplifting; Subpoena Not Delivered

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the aftermath of the Fuxing Island gold hiding case, Jin Zhensheng, one of the defendants, was previously declared innocent by the District Court. Now, Jin Zhensheng and his father, Jin Caizhi, in the role of private prosecutors, are accusing Liu Gu of extortion. According to their complaint, Liu and Jin are relatives. On March 3, Liu went to Jin's house and threatened them, saying, "You people got a lot of gold bars from the Fuxing Island case, and there are a lot of rumors going around. You need to take out 1-2 million yuan to entertain people to ensure that nothing happens." Jin refused his request. The next day, Liu, along with "Old Man" Wu Dekui and 5-6 unknown people, sealed off the front and back doors of Jin's house and searched for a 10 tael and 3 mace and 7 fen bar of gold that had been purchased by the Jin family, which was hidden in an iron box under the floor. They also took Jin Caizhi and Jin Zhensheng to the Beizhan Police Precinct and then transferred them to the District Procuratorate. After Jin was declared innocent by the District Court, he felt resentful that Liu was guilty of extortion, so he filed a complaint with the District Court. The case was being heard in the District Court yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, the defendant Liu Gu had been caught picking a passenger's pocket containing 160,000 yuan on a Route 16 trolley bus and was transferred to the police station. Therefore, the subpoena was not delivered. His wife submitted a statement of defense requesting the District Court to transfer the prisoner from the District Procuratorate for questioning. The plaintiff stated yesterday that he was willing to withdraw the lawsuit because he was surrounded by people. Judge Zhu Yuhuang informed him that the private prosecutor in this case had no right to withdraw the case, and the hearing was postponed until the defendant could be brought to court for questioning.

### Reader Consultation: Education and Culture

Terms in Painting

Mr. Li Chongxin asks: I usually like to practice painting, but I have no one to guide me. I don't know what "Six Perfections" and "Six Principles" are. Please give me detailed guidance.

[This column's answer] Among the terms in Chinese painting theory that begin with a number, there are approximately: (1) Six Principles (see general dictionaries for details, not listed here).

### British Merchants Temporarily Suspend Resumption of Rubber Market in China

[This Newspaper's Report] It was previously rumored that Dunlop Company sent a representative to Tianjin, planning to restore the rubber market in China; and that the company will sell 50,000 to 60,000 pairs of bicycle tires, which was kept in inventory in India, with a gift of copper rims, at a cheaper price than domestic products. When this reporter inquired about this matter to the Industry and Commerce Counseling Office, it was said that this rumor is already past. Currently, the difficulty of the rubber industry is the input of natural rubber. The current national demand is 3,500 tons. Rubber is controlled by Britain, the United States, France and the Netherlands. The control was cancelled this year, but after the implementation of the import limitation measure, those who have raw materials have unique commodities to keep, and within a month the price per pound increased from 1,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, and it is not easy to purchase. Now because a part of the natural rubber can be settled, the price has fallen back to 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, but the number of imported rubber is still insufficient for application, and actually a part of it relies on smugglers. The rubber industry is a promising industry in our country, and the import of its raw materials should be relaxed.

### Bullish Traders Add Positions, Chinese Stocks Rise Sharply, New Rumors About Securities Margin

Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn then rose to 7,060 yuan. Although Numbers 76 and 31 closed positions, Numbers 224, 32, 36, 35, and 157 pushed it even further to over 7,200 yuan. Current Delivery Yong Yarn was first brought to the upper limit by Number 89, and Numbers 186, 117, 85, and 143 sold to 7,200 yuan.

Rumors that the Deferred Delivery Securities Margin would be changed to 30% cash and 20% substitutes caused the price to fall back to the 7,000 yuan level. Although Numbers 8, 196, 69, and 196 bought to over 7,200 yuan, Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn finally broke through the 7,000 yuan mark at 12:00 due to Number 224's strong selling. Numbers 85, 117, 54, 65, 152, 148, 112, and 213 bought, and Number 152, Number 89, raised Deferred Delivery Yong Yarn to the upper limit again, rising back to over 7,200 yuan.

### Yarn Merchants Held Meeting Yesterday, Demanding Open Northbound Transport, Price of Yarn in the North is High, Demanding to Cancel Restrictions Based on the Hankou Example

More than 100 companies in the city that transport yarn and cloth north have seen their business come to a standstill since the implementation of control on northbound transport of yarn and cloth in February of this year. An emergency meeting was held yesterday afternoon at the Yarn and Cloth Association, chaired by Gao Wendao. A resolution was passed unanimously opposing the control measures and demanding the cancellation of restrictions and the restoration of independent sales. The authorities will be requested to quickly cancel the northbound transport control measures in accordance with the Hankou example, and handle it in accordance with the simplified rules for yarn and cloth transfer permits in order to maintain commercial hardship. According to the industry, a total of 255 Shanghai-based and Northeast China northbound yarn and cloth merchants have registered with the Spinning and Weaving Control Commission, but only over 3,000 pieces of yarn are allowed to be exported each month, and only over 1,000 yarn numbers are allowed, constantly leaving Shanghai yarn and cloth merchants without the possibility of business, and will cause panic in Northern China. The current high price of yarn in Northeast and North China is enough to stimulate yarn prices to rise. The authorities use the production volume of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China as a standard, but it is not known that a large amount of Japanese yarn was sold in North China at that time, so Hong Ying can rest assured that there will be no lack. Now that Japanese yarn is cut off, if Shanghai yarn is not transported to the north, the clothing problem of the people of North China will become increasingly serious, so the industry firmly demands that the authorities open northbound transport in order to maintain business.

[This Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Import and Export Commercial Association previously stated that the Central Bank set a uniform deadline of May 24 for all export sales entrusted for sale to be settled for exchange. Otherwise, the designated bank's foreign branch would execute the sale at an unlimited price. When the news came, foreign markets took the opportunity to suppress prices, and domestic exporters were panicked. After the association pleaded the merits and demerits, it telegraphed the relevant ministries and courts of the Central Government and the Central Bank to revoke the deadline in order to alleviate commercial difficulties. It is now heard that the Central Bank has extended the aforementioned deadline for selling and settling foreign exchange by another thirty days to June 24, after which no more alternative measures will be considered. The Import and Export Association believes that export goods are often difficult to sell in a short period of time due to seasonality or demand. Setting a deadline for exchange settlement is tantamount to ordering a wide-price sale. The impact is not only that exporters will suffer significant losses, but also that the export of domestic native products will become more stagnant. It is harmful to the country and the people, so they specially requested the Central Bank again yesterday to revoke the deadline.

Quick News from Yanzhou

### Director Peng Recounts Past Events, County Magistrate Li Shares Personal Experiences

— Our Reporter Ling Songshou

From the place where the railway was being repaired, I walked fifteen li to Yanzhou. My feet stepped step by step on the sleepers in the green grass and the rusty steel rails, and I felt a sense of bewilderment.

Upon arriving in Yanzhou, after a short rest, taking advantage of the remaining evening glow, I went with the officers and men of the Fang and Liang battalions to visit the desolate station. All the construction here was originally destroyed before the war. We have to thank the enemy for their hard work in achieving today's form. I saw that the platform still had several bridge frames, which the enemy planned to use to repair the Sishui bridge, but they didn't have time, and they laid down their weapons.

Many locomotives were parked at the station, numbering more than thirty, and currently, there are more than fourteen that can be used. After future repairs, more than twenty locomotives will not be a problem. This should be a great boost for the railway transportation authorities, given the current shortage of materials.

When the Communist army attacked the city, they once reached the station but soon withdrew. To this day, the buildings on both sides of the station are riddled with bullet holes, resembling a desolate scene. However, the nearby residents are accustomed to the situation and remain unmoved. Old women grind wheat bran with their bound feet, occasionally casting surprised glances at our group of travelers from afar. In the sky, flocks of crows return to their nests, frequently cawing in the evening breeze. Yanzhou, having experienced many dangers, has now returned to its tranquility.

A Fourth-Class Small County

Yanzhou has been renamed Ziyang County. The county is very small, classified as fourth-class, less than one-third the size of Teng County. Its importance is entirely due to its military significance. On the one hand, it is the connecting point between the Jinpu and Yanjin railways, with transportation reaching in all directions. Moreover, the western part is entirely a low-lying area, known as a den of thieves throughout history. The base of the heroes of Liangshan Marsh was originally located near present-day Dancheng. Cai Jing, stationed in Yanzhou, ultimately prevented these petty criminals from causing trouble. Even now, three to four thousand remnants of Liu Bocheng's Communist army stubbornly occupy this area, with as many as nine puppet county governments in Dancheng. They still dream of reliving the heroic dreams of the Liangshan Marsh. If there is talk of suppression in the future, Yanzhou will naturally still be a good base.

Peng's Demeanor

After arriving in Yanzhou, I visited Peng Guodong, director of the Provincial Government's Southwest Shandong Office. Peng is from Chaling, Hunan, and has held many important military and political positions in the past. Recently, he was transferred from the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters to take charge here. He has not yet met Wang Yaowu, chairman of Shandong Province. Because Wang was previously in the Ninth War Zone when Peng was the deputy director of the Political Department, he knew a little about his aspirations and knowledge. Therefore, soon after assuming the chairmanship, he repeatedly sent letters and telegrams urging him to take charge of western and southern Shandong's administration and provincial party affairs. In today's declining officialdom, to still have people like Wang and Peng and such a style gives the reporter a very deep and good impression. I talked with Director Peng for half a day, and we both lamented the heavy burden on the common people during the military period as a hidden worry. The location of the office was the Shaoling Academy in the Song Dynasty and the Longxing Temple in the Ming Dynasty. To this day, the pagoda of Longxing Temple still towers on the northeast corner of the city. In the courtyard, there is an earthen mound, the highest point in the city, with a Ministry of Works ancestral hall, dedicated to the statue of the Minister of Works. The Minister of Works' father once served as the magistrate here, and the Minister of Works came to visit his parents, so he left such a memorial.

Remnants of the King of Lu

The reporter and Director Zhao climbed up to overlook the city; Peng pointed to the place where the Ming King of Lu resided, now a ruin. It is said that the grease discarded from the royal palace made the nearby area particularly fertile, with wells in every mu of land for irrigation. There were three harvests a year, and each harvest could provide food for the entire city for three months. As the morning breeze blew, the wheat waves rose and fell, and the farmers bent over, reaping in between. The reporter heard Peng's trivial talk about Yu Sang, and his thoughts surged endlessly. On the south side of the earthen mound, there is a huge mansion facing the street, stretching across several platforms. It is the relic of the story of "审头剌汤" (The Trial of the Head and the Assassination of Tang) in Peking Opera. Meng County's Liangxia Store is related to the story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai's love affair as classmates. The peaks and mountains are beautiful, and there is a ancestral hall for the two of them. The reporter passed through the area, and the travelers were in a hurry, regretting that they could not visit the place. But here, I saw the old site of this ancient love killing case, which can be considered a compensation for the past. The Tang family's old business was mounting and backing paintings. The people here call them "Tang the Mounter's family," which is quite contemptuous. Unfortunately, the reporter doesn't know the details, otherwise, it would be worthwhile to visit.

Atmosphere of Wind and Sand

The streets of Yanzhou are very long, two or three Huaxing from the station to the east gate, and more than five Huaxing from the east gate to the west gate. These two sections were commercial districts before the war, but now they are desolate. Those who come and go in the misty yellow sand, besides military vehicles, are only the clumsy ox carts, slowly dragging forward. The drivers constantly whip the backs of the oxen and make "Ah... Shh..." sounds. Most of the large shops on the roadside are closed. Taking photo studios as an example, although there are four or five, none of them dared to accept my rolls of film for development, because they were not confident that they could develop them. Soybean milk and fried dough sticks are the main food here, still with a bit of southern flavor, and the price has reached 500 yuan per stick. A few shops sell white rice, with the words "Jiangnan Rice" and "Wuxi Qing Rice" added. This, in the eyes of southerners, is a very strong northern atmosphere. I am a southerner, and my taste is different, so I only eat rice that costs 3,600 yuan per catty. 3,600 yuan per catty, which is equivalent to 540,000 per dan (unit of weight).

The So-Called Three "Mores"

I took a bath in a very luxurious bathroom. I chatted with the attendant, and he told me that Yanzhou has three "mores": more wells, more temples, and more hidden prostitutes than overt ones. The abundance of wells is caused by geographical factors. Central Shandong is mostly mountainous, while the western part is a vast plain. The Grand Canal and Dushan Lake run through it, and the mountains and waters in the west all flow northwest into the Grand Canal or the lake. This affects the capacity of the Grand Canal itself and is the main reason why the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu often breaches its banks. However, it has made it convenient for the people in this area to dig a few feet and get water. As for the abundance of temples, this is not surprising in a theocratic society, but in my opinion, the temples here are not that many. As for the third sentence, it refers to private prostitutes. It is said that there are very few public prostitutes here. In a land of propriety and righteousness and a place close to the sacred ground, it is allowed to have its traditional masks.

Entering and Exiting the City Gates

The strict checks by the military authorities have divided Yanzhou city into two areas, inside and outside the city. Most of those entering and exiting the city gates are soldiers, with very few civilians. County Magistrate Li Zhengzhong told me that a certain official sent by the province to take over the job here could not enter the city, even with the provincial government's commission. In the end, he had to ask an acquaintance to inform the county government, and the county government sent someone to "guide" him before it was resolved. Because of this, goods cannot flow smoothly inside and outside the city, and prices inside the city are already twice as high as outside the city. This is probably due to the military's meticulousness under the past harsh environment, which has become a habit. Otherwise, now that Yanzhou is heavily guarded and the front line has been pushed 200 li away, why is it still so vigilant? Thinking of Suqian County in northern Jiangsu, where the Communist army is active only a dozen or even a few li away from the city, if I were transferred here, I don't know what I would do. I talked with County Magistrate Li about this matter and felt that for the sake of Yanzhou's social future, I urgently hope that the authorities can pay attention to this.

Administrative Miracle

I also talked with County Magistrate Li and Secretary Sun Youmou of the county government about the difficulties of county administration. The previous magistrate, Mr. Ma, was transferred to Tai'an. They two took office, and it hasn't been a few days since they took over the seal. During Magistrate Ma's tenure, due to the hard defense of the isolated city, he was busy dealing with military affairs. Therefore, the things that should have been done were not done, and the organization of the county government was fundamentally incompatible with the current laws. Currently, the county government is busy reorganizing and conducting a household survey.

Talking about the treatment of public servants and teachers, he first told me the highest figure: the section chief gets 220,000 yuan per month. Some junior staff members get 78,000 yuan. Based on the county government's two meals of noodles, it still costs 110,000 yuan per month. That is to say, to work in the county government, one has to bring 32,000 yuan from home every month to have two meals of noodles a day. Those like the servants, who get 20,000 or 30,000 yuan a month, can at least afford to drink water. Secondly, dealing with military demands is also a difficult matter. Currently, there are more than 200 military units in Yanzhou city. He listed many difficult examples for me to hear. They two used to work in the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters and had indeed worked in the army for several years. They said that in the past, they always thought that the army's demands on the county government should be a piece of cake and not that difficult. Now that it's their turn, they realize that being a county magistrate is not easy. There is quite a sense of repentance in their words. Sharing personal experiences, military and political colleagues should express sympathy after reading this. Accepting the county magistrate's kindness, I was invited to eat a noodle meal in the afternoon—this was their second meal, and they specially added a fried egg to change my taste as a guest from afar. During the meal, things to be done were listed, such as: mass organization training, youth organization training, administrative cadre training classes, libraries, mass education centers, literacy classes, health propaganda...etc. I deliberately interrupted him disappointedly: "Everything requires money!" He said well: "Let's do the things that don't cost money first!"

The Second Army Group is the main force in the battle in central Shandong. I met with Commander-in-Chief Wang Jingjiu. He told me about the dynamics on the battlefield and firmly said: "After the recent completion of the new deployment of the National Army, there will be a major change in the war situation!" He is one of the "Three Kings of Xuzhou," tall and calm in his later years.

The headquarters is borrowed from a magnificent institution, which is often unique here. Red tiles and yellow walls, colorful and dazzling, give people a sense of solemnity and majesty!

### A Glimpse of Tanggu New Port (Part 2)

— Tianjin, 8th (Air Mail) Xing Qishen

The construction of New Port was decided by the Japanese after they occupied North China in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic, in order to plunder the essential resources of North China, such as coal from Datong, iron from Longyan, salt from Changlu, and soil, and for the purpose of importing finished products into China. At that time, the location for port construction was studied several times. Technical personnel of the South Manchuria Railway advocated building it near the mouth of the Daqing River, that is, the location of the large northern port advocated by Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father. The Japanese military believed that Tanggu had convenient transportation, with the Tianjin commercial port behind it, and that industry and commerce would be easy to develop, and that the construction time would be economically convenient. Therefore, it was decided to build the port in Tanggu. In June of the 28th year, the Tanggu New Port Temporary Office was established in Beiping, under the Xingzhong Company, and began investigation and surveying. At that time, the plan was quite grand, with the goal of exporting 20 million tons of coal and 7 million tons of salt, iron, and stone annually, and with an annual throughput of 8 million tons as the first phase of the project. Construction began in October of the 29th year, and in October of the 30th year, it was transferred to the North China Transportation Company, renamed Tanggu New Port Port Bureau. At the peak of mobilization, there were about 1,000 staff members, about 2,500 technicians, and about 10,000 laborers. The required funds were about 800 to 900 million yuan of the puppet United Currency at that time. At the same time, construction of the direct railway between Datong and Tanggu began. By August of the 34th year, when the Anti-Japanese War was won, only 24 kilometers of the Datong-Tanggu railway had been completed, and the port construction project was completely suspended. The degree of completion of the constructed parts was not consistent. The important projects that have been constructed are described below:

Construction Progress

1.  Breakwaters: According to actual measurements, the south breakwater was 5 kilometers complete, and a partially completed part was more than 4 kilometers. The north breakwater had a partially completed part of about 6 kilometers, and only 540 meters of the accumulated breakwater part was completed.
2.  Channels: The entrance channel has been dredged to a depth of 5 meters, about 13 kilometers long and 130 meters wide, allowing passage from New Port to the first and second wharves of New Port.
3.  Wharves: The first wharf of New Port is 700 meters long, about 90% complete, and the second wharf is 350 meters long, partially completed.
4.  Locks: The lock construction project is 80% complete.
5.  Mechanical Factory: The mechanical factory has simple equipment and is roughly in embryonic form.
6.  Ships: There are more than 100 ships and marine machinery.
7.  Railways and Highways: The railway runs from Tanggu Station to the first and second wharves of New Port, 10 kilometers long. The highway has 6 kilometers of completed road surface, and the rest is uneven.

After the victory, in October of the 34th year, the Tanggu New Port Affairs Office was established by the Tianjin District Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Communications. In April of the 35th year, it was changed to the Tanggu New Port Engineering Office of the Ministry of Communications, and in August, it was changed to the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.

After the Takeover

After the Japanese surrendered, the construction of Tanggu New Port was completely stopped, the order was extremely chaotic, ships were sunk, materials were lost, machines were destroyed, houses were damaged, roads were bumpy, vehicles were lacking, and food and accommodation were difficult. There was almost a desolate scene of a full moon. After the takeover in April of the 35th year, emergency measures were taken to prepare for the resumption of work, such as repairing office buildings and dormitories, repairing roads, adding transportation equipment and telecommunications equipment. May and June were the periods for consolidation work. Since July, the parts of the project completed by the Japanese have been continued to be completed first, in order to be applied immediately, and a temporary work plan has been prepared, which has been implemented month by month from July to December. As for the end of the year, the projects to be done have been completed. Since January of the 36th year, construction has been carried out gradually according to the three-year plan.

The work and progress resumed from April of the 35th year to March of the 36th year are briefly described below:

Building Locks

The lock project was suspended in August of the 34th year, and resumed in July of the 35th year. After a year, the machinery was damaged and destroyed, materials were lost, and the lock was also submerged in water. After four months of consolidation and construction, the project below the wooden surface was completed in mid-November. The water-retaining earth dams on both sides were dug open, and water was released into the lock. On December 15, all the above-ground projects and mechanical equipment were completed, and the channel in the port was dredged to 3 to 4 meters below low tide. The test run was successful, and various shipping companies requested to pass through. From December 17 of the 35th year to March 31 of the 36th year, a total of 64 ships passed through.

In the past, when 3,000-ton ships passed through the Dagu Estuary into the Hai River, they had to use lighters to unload part of the cargo outside the estuary before they could enter the port. When ships sailed from the Hai River to the Dagu Estuary, part of the cargo had to be loaded onto lighters after the ships reached the estuary. Now, after passing through the locks, they can enter and exit fully loaded, reducing the trouble of lighterage and greatly facilitating the shipping industry.

Rectifying Ships

(1) Recovering Ships: After the Japanese surrendered, the ships of New Port were misappropriated by various parties and scattered in various places. After the takeover, the first thing to do was to recover six tugs from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In September, two crane ships and one gasoline boat were recovered from the US military stationed in Tanggu. In October, a dredger was recovered from the Qingdao Port Authority, and two tugs and one soil transport ship were recovered from the 8th Regiment of the Shandong Security Corps. In December, another tug was recovered from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Shanghai. A total of 14 ships were recovered. The remaining ships misappropriated in various places are still being negotiated for recovery.

(2) Salvaging Ships: Before the takeover, many ships were sunk in various places. Due to the lack of workers and tools, they had to be salvaged gradually according to priority. Currently, 14 ships have been salvaged, and the rest are being salvaged.

(3) Repairing Ships: There were about 80 ships originally stored in the port and salvaged, most of which were damaged and unusable. Therefore, they rushed to repair them for emergency use. In order to speed up the process, part of the ships were sent to state-run or privately-run factories for repair. A total of 38 ships were repaired by themselves, and 18 ships were sent to outside factories for repair.

Rushing to Dredge

After the victory, work was stopped. Because the breakwater was not completed, mud and sand drifted into the port, causing it to become increasingly silted up. The measurement in September showed that the main channel was only 2 to 3 meters deep, and the area in front of the first wharf was silted up to 2 meters. Since October of the 35th year, four existing mud barges have been used, and a self-propelled dredger has been borrowed from the Haihe Engineering Bureau to rush to dredge. The channel has been dredged to a depth of 3.5 meters, and part of the area in front of the first wharf has been dredged to a depth of 4 to 5 meters, which can barely allow passage. At the same time, the dredged soil was transported to the low-lying area to be filled in the northeast corner of the first and second wharves, and a total of about 160,000 cubic meters of soil has been filled.

Other Projects

(1) Water Supply Equipment: The completion of the water supply project not only supplies water to factories and worker dormitories, but also supplies fresh water to ships parked in the port at any time for the operation of engines and drinking water for passengers.

(2) Repairing Roads: After the takeover, most of the roads in the port were damaged and uneven. After gradual repairs, they can barely be used. It is estimated that 12.5 kilometers of roads have been repaired, with an area of 100,000 square meters.

(3) Repairing and Building Houses: A total of more than 20,000 square meters of new and repaired houses have been built.

Wharf Business

The wharves are divided into Tanggu and New Port. The four wharves in Tanggu are located on the Binhai River, and the New Port wharves are located in the port. Because the silt in front of the New Port wharves has not been completely removed, there are still few ships berthed. In mid-January of this year, part of the area in front of the first wharf was dredged to a depth of 5 meters, and the 5,000-ton giant ship "New China" has berthed there to load and unload goods. However, most of the current business is still at the Tanggu wharves.

### Boating on West Lake

— Hangzhou, 10th (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

Hangzhou is experiencing a heat wave like midsummer, followed by drizzling rain. The summer heat is driven away by the overcast rain, and it feels like early autumn. The West Lake also changes with the climate, sometimes delicate and fiery, sometimes gentle and calm. One afternoon after a rainstorm cleared, I invited Mr. Feng Zikai, Mr. and Mrs. Li Puyuan, and the new writer Mr. Wuming to the lakeside.

Mr. Feng loves West Lake the most, loving her tranquility and serenity. He once painted a landscape painting of West Lake in the remote southwest, longing for West Lake, and he once collected poems praising West Lake by ancient people to decorate the walls for appreciation. Now, Mr. Feng has three small houses in front of the Ge Ling Mountain in the Inner West Lake, which are arranged neatly and elegantly. The painting he made in the rear, longing for West Lake, is still hanging in the center of the guest room. He once told me that he has traveled through more than a dozen provinces, but he feels that West Lake is the best.

West Lake, she can make people think deeply and immerse themselves in the realm of thought. She can make people transcend the mundane and reach a sublime realm. Boating Trip

I went with Mr. Wuming in our unique "Shen Bao rowing boat" to the Inner West Lake, landed on the shore, and arrived in front of a very Chinese-style house. Mr. Feng had already come out to greet us. Mr. and Mrs. Li Puyuan were already waiting at Mr. Feng's house, and we invited them to come aboard.

We asked: "Where are we going?"

"Wherever the rower pleases!" said Mr. Feng. So we slowly passed Fanghe Pavilion, Feng Xiaoqing's tomb, and then glided past Su Die's tomb. I sighed that Su Xiaoxiao's tomb was so embellished, but Su Manshu's tomb was unattended. Mr. Wuming said: "This is better. Otherwise, Master Manshu will also be uneasy in the ground."

The rowing boat passed through the Xiling Bridge, and the mountains surrounding the lake were covered with a thin veil of white mist. I proposed again the slogan that Hangzhou should be built into a cultural city, and the three of Feng, Li, and Wuming naturally expressed their approval. Here, we hope that Hangzhou will not be built into a garden city that only has a superficial appearance for people to admire, let alone be built into an uninspired Hollywood-style oriental Hollywood. We want a cultural metropolis with a beautiful soul. Mr. Feng said: "How can literati live in the complicated Shanghai? Mostly because of兼职 (part-time jobs), such as teaching in schools or being editors in libraries, they would not be able to live easily if they quit." Therefore, we want to call on academic and cultural institutions to move to Hangzhou. At the same time, the state should reward cultural products and provide a concrete guarantee for the lives of literati. The above two points require the government to make a resolute decision to implement, but they also depend on the efforts of cultural figures.

Returning by Boat in Wind and Rain

The boat had passed Ruan Gongdun, and the east wind gradually blew from the center of the lake. Arriving at the small island of Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, we stepped on the Nine-Bend Bridge and thought of the blinding vermilion color of the lakeside buildings. The railings of this Nine-Bend Bridge and the Swastika Pavilion are also red! But they are a bit darker brown. Feng and Li said: "Colors like this still look a bit old, while the vermilion colors in places like Broken Bridge seem too beautiful." Mr. Feng remembered that there used to be a couplet by Yu Ququ in Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, but now it is gone. He also remembered Nanmu Hall, so we turned into the Temple of the Worthies, which looked dilapidated. Although a few side rooms and halls can vaguely show the former scenery, the flower path is barren, the branches are scattered, and the rooms are full of dirt and dust. We finally arrived at Nanmu Hall, and some of the ceilings seemed about to fall, but the four hugging Nanmu trees stubbornly tried to maintain their firmness to support this dilapidated courtyard. There is a pool in the courtyard, with the words "Idle Release Terrace" written on it. The glass windows on all sides are broken, and the window frames are covered with cobwebs. Mr. Feng stroked his long beard and said that a case had occurred here: "Before the war, a girl went to the toilet on the left side of Nanmu Hall, but she didn't know that a robber cut her to death and took the girl's gold bracelet. At that time, there was a telephone line to the city, and the lakeside was immediately placed under martial law, and the thief was caught." We wondered why Xiaoyingzhou is a must-see place for visitors, but Nanmu Hall, which is also on the small island, has been treated coldly. I think Nanmu Hall can be slightly decorated to serve as a place for literati gatherings, and the rooms in front of Nanmu Lu can be used as temporary reception and rest places for literati. It is a pity that it is left unused now, and it is not a way to preserve famous scenic spots to allow it to become barren.

We went around to the stone steps where the boats were moored on Xiaoyingzhou, and the black clouds converged from all directions. The rain gently knocked on our foreheads, and there were slight ripples on the lake. The heavy fog obscured the scenery in front of us, and our rowing boat sailed into the depths of the misty rain. The five people in the boat all said in unison: "It's really returning by boat in the wind and rain."

Mr. Three Nos

Mr. Feng was originally known as "Mr. Three Wan": the so-called Three Wan means that he used to teach in Jiangwan, Shanghai, lived in Chongde Zhanmen Wan, and lived in Yangliu Wan, Jiaxing. Now, some people call him "Mr. Three Nos": that is, he does not teach, does not give speeches, and does not attend any banquets. He now specializes in research and writing. Mr. Li is a great general of the drama movement, and he is now directing several plays in Hangzhou. We asked him to write a few more scripts on this beautiful West Lake. Mr. Wuming is immersed in writing on the West Lake, and he can be said to be a new writer who is devoted to writing (author of "Beast, Beast, Beast" and other novels). That night, I prepared wine for a late-night chat, and everyone felt the need to strengthen the warmth.

### The Activities of Tsarist Russia's Representatives in Outer Mongolia during the Early Republic

— Zheng Linshou

Korostovetz, a confidential advisor during the Tsarist Russian era, dedicated his life to being a diplomat. After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, he served as a key Russian official during the Sino-Russian negotiations regarding Southern Manchuria (1901) and the Treaty of Portsmouth following the Russo-Japanese War (1905). From 1907 to 1912, he was specially appointed by the Russian court as the plenipotentiary minister to China, and from then on, he was regarded as an authority on Far Eastern issues. At that time, Tsarist Russia had designs on Outer Mongolia and sent Korostovetz as its representative to Kulun to conclude a treaty with the Outer Mongolian government. He resided in the capital of Mongolia for eight months before returning to the Russian capital. More than a decade later, Korostovetz, with the cooperation of Hauer, a lecturer at the University of Berlin (who had translated books such as "The Veritable Records of the Qing Dynasty"), compiled his knowledge and experiences regarding Mongolia from the height of Mongolian power until 1925 into a book entitled "From Genghis Khan to the Soviet Republic." It was published in 1926 by the Druckerei de Gruyter in Berlin, Germany. This grand book consists of 41 chapters, an appendix containing the constitution of the Outer Mongolian Republic, a total of 351 pages, 38 illustrations, and a detailed map of Outer Mongolia. It is truly a masterpiece of Mongolian history. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, our country has been weakening, and there has been a lament about the inability to reach the distant frontier. Foreign powers have taken the opportunity to invade and conspire to separate our dependencies. Now is the time for our people to strive and strengthen ourselves. How can we afford to engage in petty squabbles? Korostovetz's book discusses the relationship between Russia and Mongolia and the process of Russia's management of Outer Mongolia in great detail. Therefore, I have selected important aspects of the relationship between China, Russia, and Mongolia to inform those who are concerned about the issue of Outer Mongolia.

During the reigns of Genghis Khan and Batu Khan, Russian territory was once conquered by the Mongols. Russian monarchs were required to pay homage to the Khans and offer tributes. Promotions and demotions were controlled by the Mongols. Later, due to frequent internal strife among the Mongols, their power gradually declined, and the outer tributaries gradually rebelled. By the middle of the 16th century, the Russians could no longer be restrained. At the beginning of the 18th century, Peter the Great attempted to open a route through the northern territories to India. From then on, Russian power began to extend into Central Asia. Since Outer Mongolia had long been a shield for China, it was inevitable that there would be dealings with our government. Therefore, the Treaty of Nerchinsk between China and Russia (1689), the Treaty of Kyakhta (1727), and the Treaty of Aigun (1858) were all related to Mongolia.

The Russian and Mongolian borders were adjacent, and the mutual trade between the two sides was frequent. The Russians always regarded Mongolia as a source of raw materials and attached great importance to its significance as a buffer zone. Expert meetings and the dispatch of commercial inspection missions deep into Mongolia were not without reason. At the end of the 19th century, Russians flocked to Mongolia for inspections. In 1910, the Moscow Chamber of Commerce funded a commercial inspection delegation led by Colonel W. Popow. Representatives from major Russian merchants and the Ministry of Commerce participated. The delegation members gathered in Kyakhta and departed in several teams, traversing Mongolia and reaching as far south as Zhangjiakou. This made important contributions to the promotion of Russian commerce in Mongolia and the establishment of banks. Later, the government sent University Professor Bogolepow to study the economic situation in Mongolia, and he also published a specialized book.

As for the trade goods between Russia and Mongolia, industrial manufactured goods, cloth, ironware, enamel utensils, flour, sugar, tobacco, matches, wine, kerosene, and silver ingots were exported from Russia to Mongolia; wool, leather, various furs, and pig and sheep intestines were mainly transported from Mongolia to Russia. The commerce between China and Russia in Mongolia rose and fell. During the Russian civil strife from 1918 to 1922, its position in Central Asia was greatly affected, and Chinese commerce took the opportunity to develop.

During the Xinhai Revolution, Outer Mongolia declared its independence, with Dschebdsun Damba Hutuktu as the Great Khan. At that time, Outer Mongolia sought help from Russia, and Russia also benefited from supporting Outer Mongolia's independence. However, initially, it was still hesitant due to fear of conflict with China. When Outer Mongolia sent representatives to St. Petersburg in 1911, the Russian government considered whether to grant an audience, and the government's decision was only made after the encouragement of the Russian Minister to China.

The most active advocate for Russia to establish its influence in Mongolia was Korostovetz. In December 1911, Korostovetz had just returned from Beijing and repeatedly visited Foreign Minister S.D. Sasonow and Prime Minister W.N. Kotowzew to exchange views. The cabinet then decided to specially appoint Korostovetz as an envoy to Kulun. This was approved by the Russian Emperor, and 100,000 rubles were allocated for gifts and travel expenses. Although the Russians kept this move highly secret, the news media had already revealed the news of the Russo-Mongolian treaty. The Beijing government was greatly disturbed and sent Noyantu to Kulun to persuade the Hutuktu, but he was obstructed by the Mongols, and the Chinese troops sent could not enter the territory.

In early September 1912, Korostovetz left St. Petersburg, passed through Irkutsk and Kyakhta, and arrived in Kulun in a few days. At that time, the key figures in the Outer Mongolian government were Sain Noyan Khan as Prime Minister, Prinz Hangda Dorji as Foreign Minister, Da Lama as Interior Minister, Erdeni Wang Namsarai as Finance Minister, and Dalai Wang as Minister of Military Affairs. Most of them were pro-Russian elements. As for the Russian personnel participating in the negotiations, in addition to the envoy, there were also Secretary Eltekow and Ljuba, the Consul-General in Kulun.

Initially, the Outer Mongolian princes were unsure whether to be pro-China or pro-Russia. After Korostovetz repeatedly explained the benefits of being pro-Russia and the harms of being pro-China, on the one hand, he used gentle means to purchase printing presses and establish newspapers to promote Russian culture and set up Russian schools to win over Outer Mongolian youths. On the other hand, he used intimidating methods to request the government to send troops into the territory and forced the pro-China lamas to withdraw from the meetings. With the secret help of the Hutuktu's wife, the pro-Russian faction finally won. As a result, the Russo-Mongolian treaty and its annexes were signed on October 21, 1912. The next day, Foreign Minister Hangna Uorji personally went to the Russian consulate to congratulate Korostovetz on behalf of the Hutuktu, and narrated how joyful the pro-Russian faction was and how disappointed the pro-Chinese faction was. Korostovetz then donated 50,000 rubles in the name of charity to the Mongolians for longevity and distributed gold watches, cigarette cases, vases, and other items to the princes.

As for the content of the treaty, the Russian government in St. Petersburg had already drafted a draft, intending to have the Mongols accept it. Unexpectedly, the Mongolian side also proposed a draft of the treaty, the gist of which was: "Mongolia has broken away from Chinese oppression and declared itself an independent country, subject to the rule of the Great Khan. Russia should first recognize Mongolia's independence and be willing to protect it." As for Russia's desire to recognize Outer Mongolia's autonomy and the special right to elect the Hutuktu as monarch, it was not mentioned at all. The Russians not only had no right to purchase real estate but also could not travel within the territory without obtaining permits. Because of these various issues, the opinions of the two sides were divided, and a rupture was imminent. After repeated discussions and the elimination of dissidents, an agreement was finally reached.

The original treaty consisted of four articles and seventeen annexes. The four original articles are translated as follows:

Article 1: The Imperial Russian Government will assist Mongolia in maintaining its autonomy and possessing its own army, and will not allow Chinese troops to enter the territory or Chinese to colonize it.

Article 2: The Mongolian monarch and the Mongolian government shall allow Russian citizens and Russian businesses to enjoy all the rights stipulated in the annexes. Citizens of other countries shall naturally not enjoy rights superior to those of Russian citizens.

Article 3: If the Mongolian government deems it necessary to conclude special agreements with China or other countries, such special agreements shall not harm or alter the provisions of this treaty and its annexes without the consent of the Imperial Government.

Article 4: This treaty of friendship shall take effect on the date of signing.

Today, after our country's victory in the war of resistance against aggression, the overall situation has not been completely improved, and the threat of foreign aggression still exists. What has been achieved by the efforts of our more than 400 million Chinese people over the past thirty years? What was the price of the eight years of sacrifice? Reflecting on the past and present, how can we not feel emotional?

Commentary

### Protector

— Zijin

Downstairs in the courtyard, there was a chirping sound of little chicks. I went downstairs to take a look, and sure enough, my wife had bought them from a countryman's carrying pole into the city. A total of sixteen chicks were bought, costing 40,000 yuan, each worth 2,500 yuan. I blamed her for buying too many and too expensive. She said, "These are hatched chicks, not like those raised in a heated kang, which only cost a thousand or a few hundred yuan each. Those raised in a heated kang are not easy to raise to adulthood. Hatched chicks are natural, lively, and interesting. It's worth buying them even if they are a bit more expensive."

I laughed and said, "You're really not afraid of trouble. Aren't you tired of raising chicks yet? Just thinking about it for you gives me a headache!"

She said, "Not at all! Look at their downy, yellow fur, their tiny island-like figures, they're so endearing! Besides, watching them grow up day by day, it's worth raising them for the sake of interest."

"Interest? Fun? I still remember you crying for the chicks and ducklings. Is crying also interesting and fun?" After I said that, she couldn't help but laugh.

Two years ago, in the countryside of Tunxi, because there was open space in the school with a lot of water and grass, she bought dozens of chicks and ducklings and raised them, acting as their nanny every day, chasing them in and out, sifting crushed rice for the chicks,撈浮萍提蚯蚓 (I don't understand this part, perhaps gathering duckweed and earthworms) for the ducklings, borrowing chicken coops and duck pens to make comfortable nests for them. She was very busy and enthusiastic. The chicks and ducklings grew up day by day. After two months, the chicks were about to grow wings, and the ducklings could swim and forage for themselves.

Ten of each, they mingled together as friends. The chicks pecked at the grass, hopping around, while the ducks stretched their heads and beaks, swaying and waddling into the damp places. In the evening, my wife put them in separate nests, letting them each find their different sweet dreams.

Unexpectedly, one night, we went to a banquet at a relative's house in Tunxi. Afraid of returning to school too late, we stayed overnight at their place. The next morning, upon returning, we met a student who gave us an unpleasant report, saying that all the chicks had been dragged away by weasels, and only the ducklings were safe and sound.

When we went to the small room where the chicks and ducklings were kept, we found that there were indeed no chicks left in the coop.

My wife's disappointment was, of course, needless to say. She was angry and regretful, with tears in her eyes, returning the chicken coops to their owners. She released the ducklings, which wandered around on the ground, sniffing and rolling, seemingly mourning for their companions.

My wife originally favored chicks. Although she also raised ducklings, she didn't like them very much because they were more troublesome to raise, and the ducklings also produced more excrement and urine, which was a bit too dirty. Therefore, she had no intention of raising them anymore and gave them all to the country people.

After the victory, we moved to a university in the mountains. Her preference and interest led her to raise chicks again. Raising chickens in the mountains was really great. They grew up very quickly. In a few months, she raised many hens, which laid eggs, collecting them in pairs. Therefore, we didn't have to worry about having eggs every morning.

Also, in the early summer weather, a wild cat came from somewhere. Taking advantage of people's lack of vigilance, it dragged away a chicken every day, first dragging away the smaller ones, and later even dragging away the larger ones. It was impossible to prevent. We often found dead chickens that had been harmed in the weeds, with a bite on the head and the blood sucked out. Sometimes the meat on the thighs was eaten clean, and the mutilated body was thrown down, becoming a tragic, pale corpse.

When she saw these tragic scenes, she was easily moved and burst into tears.

These past events made me worry about this kind-hearted protector. This time, I couldn't help but warn her again. She said, "Okay! There shouldn't be any more weasels and wild cats in this place! I hope that assassination and harm will disappear from now on."

As she spoke, she placed the sixteen newly bought chicks in a small wire basket, covered with a large towel, and hung it high on an iron hook under the eaves. Every night, she prayed for the safety of the chicks before quietly going to sleep.

May this kind-hearted protector not encounter any conspirators and assassins this time.

### Sounds of the Qin

— Yang Daming

A string of sharp notes slid down, placing memories on the piano keys. The green notes hold your laughter; I dream of a soft, rosy little mouth that can weave stories, and kind, tearful eyes.

On the empty canvas of my heart, I once painted a faint blue hymn. I have forgotten the peach blossoms of March, the roses of May. I write down the warmth of your hairline and your gentle murmurs.

Life is only young, because you are with me, keeping me company by this ebony-colored piano. Your silver bell-like voice blooms purple flowers in the depths of my soul. I listen to the soliloquy of your soul.

By the piano under the moonlight, you tell me the story of Romeo and Juliet. Under the pale green light, I am lost in a dreamlike contemplation. I am silent because I have had too many sorrowful stories.

Therefore, you don't continue to tell this beautiful story. You begin to feel lonely, and your eyes are wet with tears of disappointment.

Therefore, you ask me to tell you the sorrows hidden in my heart so that you can bear a part of my spiritual loneliness. But I answer you with silence because I don't want to paint a dark shadow on your pure white heart. I gently stroke the piano keys, placing my lonely sorrows on "One day when we were young."

Seeing your crystal tears, it must be a beautiful world! Sometimes the rouge of women ignites the flame of my youth, and sometimes a faded story makes me cry all night. — Finally, my sorrowful tears extinguished the flame of my youth. For the sake of your youthful health, I should leave this ebony-colored piano. I cannot bear to erode your beauty. Let us write a page of pure and sincere friendship, leaving it in the distant days as a memento of friendship.

No stories, no poems...;

A string of sharp notes slid down, placing memories on the piano keys. The green notes hold your laughter. But my fingers have already turned to stone.

### The "Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River" and Empress Zhen: A Minor Problem in Literary History

— Tang

Cao Zhi's famous work "Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River," according to legend, expresses his love for his sister-in-law, Empress Zhen, wife of Cao Pi. It is said to have been written "moved by Zhen." This legend has almost the same breadth as the ode itself. The earliest record of this legend is found in Li Shan's commentary on the "Wen Xuan" in the Tang Dynasty, which quotes "Ji Ri." The original text is:

"At the end of the Han Dynasty, the King of Dong'a of Wei (Cao Zhi) sought the daughter of Zhen Yi unsuccessfully. Emperor Wu (Cao Cao) returned and gave her to the General of the Five Senses (Cao Pi). Zhi was extremely displeased, thinking of her day and night, neglecting his duties and forgetting to eat. During the Huangchu period, he went to court. Emperor (Cao Pi) showed Zhi Zhen's gold-threaded belt pillow. When Zhi saw it, he couldn't help but burst into tears. At that time, she had already been slandered to death by Empress Guo. The Emperor vaguely realized the situation and kept the crown prince (Cao Zhi) for a banquet and then sold the pillow to Zhi. Zhi returned... Resting on the Luo River, he thought of Empress Zhen. Suddenly, he saw a woman coming, saying, 'I originally entrusted my heart to the king...' After saying that, she suddenly disappeared. Then, she left a playful pearl for the king, and the king responded with a jade pendant. He was overcome with grief and joy and then wrote the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River. Later, Emperor Ming (Zhen's son) saw it and changed it to the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River." If this public case really existed in the life history of Cao Zhi, this talented man, it would not be a bad story. But, if it is false, it would be unfairly slandering the ancients. However, we have proved that this story is indeed the result of embellishment by meddlesome people.

Judging from the record itself, it is so fragmented and vaguely unbelievable. With Cao Pi's status, it is not normal to show his deceased queen's pillow to his younger brother for no reason. And Zhi actually wept over it, which is even more difficult to accept as fact. Moreover, the latter part of the story describes Empress Zhen suddenly coming and suddenly leaving, like a ghost, but offering a pearl and responding with a jade pendant, like a human being. Isn't this clearly confessing to fabrication? This story is not mentioned in Chen Shou's "Records of the Three Kingdoms" and Pei Songzhi's detailed and widely cited commentary on the Records of the Three Kingdoms. This is official history, so it can be ignored. Liu Yiqing's "A New Account of Tales of the World," during the Liu Song dynasty, is a collection of anecdotal stories from the Wei and Jin periods. It records many deeds of the Cao family, even narrating Cao Pi's acquisition of Empress Zhen in the "Confusion" section. However, this story is not mentioned at all. Liu Xiaobiao's commentary on it, citing extremely detailed sources, also does not mention it. This book, which is praised for "collecting the best events and anecdotes and being extremely wonderful," did not even record such a wonderful story. This proves that this legend did not exist before Liu and Yi, or that they considered the legend unreliable.

According to the "Records of Wei" in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Empress Zhen was born in the fifth year of Guanghe (182 AD), while Cao Zhi was born in the third year of Chuping (192 AD), ten years younger than Empress Zhen. Cao Cao entered Ye, and Cao Pi obtained Empress Zhen—who was originally the wife of Yuan Xi—Cao Pi obtained her when Cao Cao conquered the neighboring territory—in the ninth year of Jian'an (204 AD). At that time, Cao Zhi was only thirteen years old. It would be a miracle for a thirteen-year-old child to be "displeased" because his older brother obtained a married woman who was ten years older than himself. Moreover, it is even more unthinkable that he would be "thinking of her day and night, neglecting his duties and forgetting to eat."

Cao Zhi went to court and wrote the ode in the fourth year of Huangchu. According to the records of official history, this was precisely when Cao Pi was suspicious and suppressed Cao Zhi and other princes meticulously. When Zhi went to see the emperor, because he had been reported two years earlier by the Supervising Attendant Bu Zhi for "drunkenness, rudeness, and coercing the envoy," he confessed his guilt, "with his head uncovered, carrying a hatchet drill, and barefoot. The emperor still had a stern expression and did not speak to him, nor did he allow him to wear a hat and shoes." Zhi lay on the ground weeping, and it was only because the Empress Dowager was unhappy that the emperor allowed him to resume his royal robes. After seeing the emperor and bidding farewell to the court to return east, Cao Zhi and his brother, the Prince of Baima, wanted to travel together to express their mutual feelings, but the Supervising Attendant did not allow it either (either at the emperor's instruction or at the attendant's implied wish). Zhi then angrily bid farewell and wrote seven poems to the Prince of Baima, full of sorrow and melancholy. Is it possible that Cao Pi would show him the pillow and give him the pillow with intimacy between these two events?

Furthermore, in terms of the ode itself, the woman described in that passage of transcendent writing, "flying like a startled swan, graceful like a swimming dragon...", is truly only supposed to exist in heaven. According to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Empress Zhen was already forty years old when she was given death by Cao Pi in the sixth month of the second year of Huangchu because she was frustrated and had complaints, and her children were already growing into adults. To say that the goddess of the Luo River, whom Zhi wrote in the Ode to the Goddess of the Luo River two years later, was so graceful and beautiful, was an allusion to her, is also difficult to believe.

So, what was the ode actually written for? He Yimen said: "In the Li Sao, it says, 'I ordered Feng Long to ride the clouds to seek where Mi Fei is.' Since Zhi was not favored by the ruler, he crossed the Luo River to write this ode, entrusting his words to Mi Fei (daughter of Fuxi, who drowned in the Luo River and later became the Goddess of the Luo River), conveying the ambition of Qu Yuan!" This statement is certainly somewhat stale, comparing beauties to monarchs and fragrant herbs to gentlemen throughout history. However, in light of the historical fact that Cao Zhi was not favored by the ruler before and after writing the ode, and in the absence of other more reliable statements, it is still more credible.

No wonder Ding Yan of the Qing Dynasty pointed out that the so-called "record" quoted by Li Shan was a "short story," and also criticized Li Shan for "not discussing the original meaning, but quoting it indiscriminately."

### Flowers and Birds

— Xu Qingyun

(Imitating the Song Imperial Academy Style)

### Nameless Little Blue Flower

— Li Weichu

It was a clear day, early in the morning, I walked from Yanggong Bridge towards Xiaolongkan. The air was, of course, fresh, and the morning light and sky had an indescribable beauty of new life; the wilderness scenery was even more fresh and lovely! On both sides of the road, there were endless green grass and rice fields. In that green grass, not far from my sight, I suddenly saw a small, lovely little blue flower. In that green, she beckoned me to come closer and take a closer look: it was a kind of sky blue, but that kind of sky blue was so unique, so elegant, and so sweet-guest! But, no one knows! I looked around, only that lonely flower, there was no second flower identical to her nearby. Looking at her beautiful and lonely little shadow, my heart was filled with love and pity. The wilderness is big, the green is deep and wide, the wind blows ruthlessly, 折 (I don't understand this word) is terrible. Perhaps in the dark night, there are also trampling and devastation by wild beasts. I suddenly had a realization: thinking of people; a lonely girl who needs to be independent, living in the treacherous sea of people, beauty may invite misfortune, and wisdom may be the root of pain. I could not help but lightly took a breath.

"How adorable, and how pitiable!"

I wanted to pick her and take her home, carefully placing her in a vase on my desk, protecting her, cherishing her; letting my sincerity warm and comfort her, cultivating her with my emotions, and nurturing her. But as my fingers just stretched out, suddenly another idea flooded into my heart:

"When she leaves her roots and cuts off the nutrients in the soil, wouldn't it be sending her weak vitality to her premature death in order to love her!" So, my outstretched fingers weakly retracted.

"Ah, yes, God is telling her to grow like this, the Creator has arranged it like this for her, her fate is destined to grow here, to grow in this wilderness, in this soil."

Thinking this way, I could only let her live alone and lonely there. I left, I stepped forward, leaving with attachment but without picking her. No one knew how far-reaching the sorrow in my own heart, my love-pity, and my heartlessness were! On that long journey, I silently recited such sentences in my heart:

Little blue flower!

Your sweet smile

Beautiful sky blue

Makes me happy!

Although you are alone

In that green patch,

You are lonely,

But I, little blue flower!

Yet from your lovely little face

I see the simple beauty of life,

Little blue flower!

That doesn't need any pity or caress...

Perhaps this is a kind of helpless self-consolation for myself? — Little blue flower! How could your soul transform into a goddess to come before me, to explain and answer me!

### Supplement to Wall Poetry Collection

— Beihai

Passing Through Florence

Leisurely, I once arrived at an ancient famous city,
A scene of streams and mountains entered my daytime vision;
Swift currents carry sand with a rustling wind,
Tall forests float emerald, crows caw;
The poignant Divine Comedy lasts for millennia,
The beautiful city of flowers appears distinct today,
I wanted to alight and visit the relics,
But only heard a few sounds of departure flutes in the desolate wilderness.

Half a lifetime spent in a declining homeland,
Two days in a light carriage making a magnificent journey;
Riding atop the mountain peaks to view the troubled world,
Along the Jian Guan Lake, befriending the sand gulls;
Temporarily using famous wine as a substitute for yellow wine,
Almost learning from the Qi's victorious, the Chu's imprisoned;
Alas, I must restlessly travel again,
How can one stay long in a foreign land?

Instant Matters in Hong Kong

Sixteen years after passing through Hong Kong again,
A favorable wind blew dreams before my parents;
Family fortunes scattered in the chaos of the world, without a trace,
My body, like tumbleweed, drifted to the seaside;
How could I not long to return home, yet fear letters,
Adding even more sorrow to my poems;
This journey is not concerned with rise and fall,
Fleeing to the wilderness on a white horse is not yet the case.

Crossing the Yellow River

Sparse shadows of coldness reflected on the Yellow River,
My horse falters, feeling the fleeting waves;
Throwing down the pen, troubled by today's affairs,
Casually, it should be more than a hundred years;
It's difficult for a beauty to inscribe the Yanran stone,
A brave man might as well sing the Yishui song;
Remotely imagining the dressing table with poems in hand,
With a whip, I have already crossed the Tuo River!

Brother Beihai is about to enter Beijing, and I inscribe these poems to bid him farewell. I admire his temporary elegance and profound insights, and I display them on the plain wall. The next day, Mr. Yiqiao visited, but Brother Beihai had already left Bai Xia. Suddenly seeing the poems on the wall, as if facing an old friend, he immediately sent a letter of regards, expressing deep appreciation. The above listed poems on passing through Florence, etc., are all impromptu verses, the meaning following the brush, flowing clearly in the ink, elegant and graceful. Reading them makes one feel deeply immersed in foreign lands, without needing to travel far to the city of water and the city of flowers to experience them. Recorded and noted by Meng Nong in June of the thirty-sixth year.

### Love and Other Things

— A Long

Love

A play with booming gongs and drums, those squeezed in the middle want to get out, and those outside want to squeeze in. Thus, there is chaos all around. Those squeezed out are like a group of homeless wanderers lingering on the streets, and those squeezed in are working hard to move forward. Those on stage, dressed in colorful clothes, are sending seductive smiles with charming eyes, and the gongs and drums are beating tightly;

However, the clamor is not as energetic as before. Afterwards, only a worn-out set of props and a few wooden sticks remain.

Despair

In the desert, the wind blows, making it hard for people to open their eyes, but it is enough to seep into the heart.

Joy

Night, a night without a moon or stars, the night traveler is waiting for some light to guide the way.

The night traveler is hard-working, often losing his way in deep valleys, but he finally reaches "Hope".

With more night travelers, impassable roads become broad avenues. We are now walking on the roads they have traveled.

City

At night, the city implies debauchery and shame. Neon lights flash with mysterious and alluring rays, and melodious music emanates from dance halls and bars.

Jazz is enough to make people forget everything.

Don't you have a restless heart yearning for a way out?

However, next to the big companies lie a group of beggars, and a few old and sick people are making low moans...

### Tree

— Lao Kai

In front of my door is an unnamed tree, which has already grown to the point where it can no longer be more luxuriant. In the clear peace of the dawn breeze, it shakes its head, disturbing a head of thick, unkempt long hair.

At noon, it is silent, occasionally emitting sigh-like light breaths under the golden sunlight. When sleepiness comes, it listlessly lays down a pile of shadows on the sidewalk; tired shadows, as if still evaporating pale heat like cooking smoke.

When dusk quietly arrives, its tall and bloated figure is smeared with a hazy, melancholic blackness. At this time, it is less like a spire peeking in all directions, and more like a trembling ghost dressed in black mourning clothes.

Every day, I lean against the door and gaze at it, and I stroll beside it alone. Due to the frequency of seeing each other, a feeling of intimacy arises naturally.

Once, as I was walking past it, I suddenly noticed a few yellow leaves falling from its top. At first, I was quite suspicious—it's summer now! Afterwards, I suddenly understood: this is the principle of "metabolism", new leaves replace the position of the remaining leaves, which are crowded out by the new leaves. It is a transformation of new life.

I raised my head and looked at those deep green, lustrous and fertile leaves, as dense as an umbrella; I then lowered my face and looked at those withered and haggard leaves that had long lost the color of life, lying silently in the soil, without a trace of struggling power. In this way, I could not help but be aroused by a cruel pleasure; moreover, I associated it with very distant things.

Let the newly born live quickly, let the not-yet-dead die quickly,

This tree, still an unnamed tree, should be a powerful symbol, should be a tender but unbreakable hope!

### Random Notes on Taiwan History

— Chi Fu

Great Personage Zheng Chenggong

The history of Taiwan was created by Yanping Prince Zheng Chenggong of the Ming Dynasty. There are many records about Zheng Chenggong, the most important of which are Huang Zongxi's "The Beginning and End of the Imperial Surname," Xu Chongji's "Chronicle of Zheng Chenggong," Yu Zongxin's "Ming Yanping Prince's Maritime Kingdom of Taiwan," and Jiang Risheng's "Unofficial History of Taiwan." During the 50 years of Japanese rule in Taiwan, the Japanese collected a lot of historical materials about the Zheng family, which are now treasured in Taiwan, but no one is taking care of them, which is very regrettable.

Taiwanese people believe in Zheng Chenggong like they believe in religion. Temples and shrines are built in cities large and small to commemorate this great personage. There is an excellent couplet at the "Yanping Prince Zheng Chenggong Shrine" in Taipei City, which reads: "From scholar to prince, he upheld half of the old country, giving all scholars under heaven a new dignity. Driving out the foreign barbarians, he opened up a new world for thousands of years, wishing that all Chinese with ambition would once again demonstrate their heroic spirit."

Tang Jingsong's Taiwan Democratic State

In 1895 (the 21st year of Guangxu), Li Hongzhang signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan. When the news reached Taiwan, the people were filled with grief and indignation. Tang Jingsong, the Taiwan Governor, was very dissatisfied with the Qing Dynasty's loss of power and humiliation of the country. Therefore, Taiwan jointly elected Tang as the Grand President, with Liu Yongfu, the Director of Defense, as his deputy. On May 2nd of that year, the Taiwan Democratic State was established, with the reign title of Yongqing. The national flag was made, a rectangular flag with a yellow tiger on a blue background, the tiger's head facing inward, the tail high and the head low. Upon the establishment of the Democratic State, Tang Jingsong personally drafted a proclamation, which was filled with blood and tears, and was the earliest document in China advocating democracy and independence.

Tang Jingsong was from Guangxi. His support from the Taiwanese people shows that Taiwan was not exclusive in the past. The Taiwan Democratic State only had a history of twelve days before the Japanese military directly invaded Taiwan; however, the Taiwanese people's perseverance and unyielding will have not diminished to this day. Today, Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian founded "Jingsong Middle School" in Guangxi to commemorate this great democratic hero.

Qiu Fengjia's Indignation

Before the establishment of the Taiwan Democratic State, it was Qiu Fengjia who ran around and appealed with all his might, and actively advocated independence. He was a wise man with both talent and integrity. After the Japanese army occupied Taiwan, Qiu Fengjia left Taiwan in a sorry state and composed six poems expressing his grief, patriotism, revenge, indifference, and tranquility. Later generations should read it as a document and as good literature. The full text of the six poems of leaving Taiwan is copied below:

"The prime minister has the power to cede land, and a lonely minister is powerless to turn the tide. Knowing that I will become a barbarian, my heart is dimmed by the loss of the country and its mountains!

Hide the military strategies for now, and stop talking about being a halberd-holding official in the Chengming Palace. What did the bearded man ultimately achieve? A carpenter's square in the palace resembles Xianyang.

It is impossible to know if we can make a comeback, and the country must also be held by great men; how many worthy sons have achieved fame? Who will raise the banner of righteousness on the sea?

From now on, I fear that the Central Plains will sink, and the Eastern Zhou is even weaker than it is today; I will go into the mountains with a cold eye to observe the situation, and I am deeply moved by the thorns and bronze camels.

A hero who retreats is a god, eliminating anger and cultivating morality; I am not a god, but I will dwell in the sword gorge, and ascend to heaven after all enemies are beheaded.

It is difficult for flesh and blood to reunite in troubled times, and brothers are sad to part; I will serve my parents and live as a fisherman and woodcutter, and famous mountains everywhere can be a place to stay."

What emotionally rich and full of national will poems! The 50 years of revolutionary struggle of the Taiwanese people is precisely the manifestation of "It is impossible to know if we can make a comeback, and the country must also be held by great men"!

### Old Poetry Collection

— Hai Ruo

"Long drought meets sweet rain, meeting an old friend in a foreign land; the bridal chamber with candles on a lonely night, the moment of being named on the gold list." This poem is widely circulated, and everything in it is joyful, so someone titled it the Four Joys Poem. It is also known as the Poem of Triumph.

In the Wuchen year of the Longqing reign of the Ming Dynasty, Wen Zhengchun of Houguan passed the imperial examination and was selected for the Imperial Academy. One day, he met Wang Duinan of Shanyin, who used the above poem to tease him, saying that the four joys only have five characters, which is not enough to be joyful, and each should add two characters. He said: "Ten years of prolonged drought finally meets sweet rain, thousands of miles away from home, one meets an old friend; a monk is in the bridal chamber on a candlelit night," Before he finished speaking, Duke Wen laughed loudly and said: "Isn't the next sentence 'A teaching official is named on the gold list'?" Those who heard it roared with laughter.

There are also some who, for the sake of good fun, created a contrasting version, titled Poem of Disappointment. The sentences are: "A widow returns home carrying her crying child, a general is captured by the enemy; a palace maid loses favor, a person who fails the examination disappoints people." The state of sadness and joy is truly very different.

In ancient times, to become an official, one had to pass the imperial examination to be considered a legitimate path. Therefore, there was a saying "Thirty is old to be a mingjing, fifty is young to be a jinshi," which shows the general difficulty of it.

In the Qing Dynasty, there was a child student who was almost seventy years old and had not yet entered school. The education commissioner Fa sympathized with his old age, so he bestowed him a xiucai. He also wrote a pagoda song, saying: "Old man, old child student, his luck is good, with disheveled white hair, he is the great-grandfather's older brother." Although the words are false, they also show the hardships of the imperial examination field.

### New Chinese Typewriter

— Da Ming

Due to the invention of the English typewriter, they saved a lot of manpower and time. This made us think of designing a Chinese typewriter to replace the thousands of copyists in government offices. However, Chinese characters are individual squares, unlike Western languages, which are combined from letters, so it is very difficult. Moreover, there are many Chinese characters. According to the codebook of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau, there are more than nine thousand characters. Ordinary dictionaries contain more than ten thousand characters, and university dictionaries contain more than fifteen thousand characters. It is impossible to cast them into lead types and put them on a typewriter. If they are divided into left, right, top, and bottom blocks to combine strokes, the size will be limited. Many people in the country have researched it, but so far there is no completely satisfactory typewriter. However, a typewriter designed recently under the guidance of Dr. Lin Yutang is much more advanced.

As early as 1929, Mr. Zhou Houkun of the Commercial Press had placed lead types in a movable barrel, imitating the Japanese typewriter method. Later, it was improved by Mr. Wang Yunwu and Mr. Hong Weilian of Yenching University. It has a plate containing 2,500 ordinary printed lead types. The typist must be very familiar with this plate, otherwise typing will not be as fast as writing.

In 1945, under the leadership of Dr. Lin, this Chinese typewriter designed in the United States is now widely used, but the Commercial Press has not yet produced it. He first abandoned the classification using the index of ordinary Chinese dictionaries and completely used eye lines as the standard, regardless of whether the strokes were written first or last. There are thirty-six keys on the machine representing the top part of the character (highest), and twenty-eight keys representing the bottom part of the character (lowest). The combination of the top and bottom parts has one thousand and eight different combinations, with an average of four characters in each category. When typing, pressing down the top part and the bottom part of the character will cause a "window" on the machine to display the characters that can be contained by the combination of these two keys. This "window" also indicates the position of the character in the category of characters. There are eight printing keys under the machine, which are used to type the character according to its position in the window. Since there are one thousand and eight categories, each category has a "first place", and the character in the first place is the most commonly used character. Those who are not familiar with it can also type by looking at the window. If there are characters with left and right radicals, they are typed separately on the left and right sides, and the remaining full characters are typed. There are a total of six thousand lead types in the machine, which are installed in a cylinder that is six and three-tenths inches long and four and five-tenths inches in diameter. The lead types are arranged in circles on six movable small cylinders in this cylinder. When a key is pressed, any character on the cylinder can be moved to the printing position. Characters with a left radical need to be pressed five times, and the rest are pressed three times. However, when the character used is not formed by left and right radicals, such as "我" (I), "人" (person), "為" (for), "立" (stand), "坐" (sit), "來" (come), "去" (go), "水" (water), "天" (sky), "團" (group), "家" (family), "弟" (brother), "兄" (older brother), "文" (writing)... etc., there are more than seven hundred. The other three hundred commonly used characters with left and right radicals are also typed "three times" for the full character. For example, in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, there are one hundred and forty-five characters, only twenty-five of which have left and right radicals, but only three of them need to be typed "five times" for the left and right parts, and the remaining one hundred and forty-two characters are typed as the full character.

There are a total of eight thousand empty positions on the machine. In addition to these six thousand lead types, the two thousand remaining are prepared to add English letters (and a few special Russian and French letters), Japanese letters, and extremely rare characters in ancient Chinese books. In this way, this typewriter is complete. The typist can simultaneously press down the top and bottom keys with both hands, and then press down the printing key. The key also advances the paper by one space, both vertically and horizontally. Not only compared to the English typewriter, there are many shortcomings, it is not fast enough, and it is not easy to master, but these are engineering problems. We hope that people with aspirations will conduct more research, and there will be more advanced typewriters in the future.

### "Freedom" Talk

— Xiao Tong

Bertrand Russell said: "A country cannot exist properly without freedom." Berlin Pollock also said: "Freedom is to a group as health is to an individual's body. Without health, people have no happiness to enjoy, and without freedom, society has no happiness to enjoy." Everyone in the world has the special privilege of being able to do things themselves. People need freedom, and no one wants their special privilege of freedom to be deprived. Throughout history, many small and weak nations have endured the greatest pain, forged an iron will, and finally roared, resisted, and fought for the special altar of freedom from the blood and tears of revolution.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shou Ou

"Good! We elect Old Lu!"

But Lu Qian tried hard to decline, no matter how much he was persuaded, he would not agree. Finally, Lao Zhu said to him like this:

"Old Lu, everyone used to laugh at you for being too pessimistic, only knowing how to complain and sigh. You often felt that this was an insult. Today, now that we've reached this point, don't you want to prove that you are not a cowardly pessimist?"

These few words stirred up the lame Lu.

"Okay! But I have a few words to say first." His face flushed, somewhat overexcited, and he could hardly speak the first few words. "If you really want to elect me as the leader, then I simply don't want to lead everyone to flee like homeless dogs!"

His words startled everyone, and twenty or thirty pairs of eyes all focused on his unusually ordinary face.

"We are also people, also dignified citizens. I couldn't stand being chased like this, fleeing in the face of the enemy! Life has death since ancient times. Why are we so afraid of the devils? And a nation like us, without organization or vigor, no matter where you flee, people will still come after you! Do you really want to escape to the Himalayas?"

The pent-up anger in Lu Qian's chest for several years was truly vented today; Zhu Zhaonian tilted his face, smiling silently, temporarily forgetting everything about the invitation.

"Before, it was only us fighting the Japanese devils with our lives, and we could barely justify losing. Now that someone has come to help, and we are still so hopeless!" He raised an arm with a clenched fist, waving it above his head, like an excellent speaker. "After fighting for so long, we still haven't recovered an inch of land, and we still insist on saving face, talking about dispersion, advancing, retreating,抢运... refusing to say a word of defeat, it's simply shameless!..."

Many guests on the platform also gradually crowded around them.

### The Zou Yuechang Case and Others

— Lu Dan

The case of Zou Yue'e, a female teacher from Tongli Town, Wujiang, Jiangsu, who was raped to death, has now shocked the entire country. It is said that women's groups in Wujiang have also submitted a complaint to the highest authorities. The town once went on strike, and primary school students were also shocked, frightened, and angry when they heard that their teacher had died so tragically. According to yesterday's Ta Kung Pao, three suspects in uniform have been arrested locally. The captain of the military officer's brigade has also issued an order to severely punish those who run rampant and act recklessly. This matter has become a big issue, although it has exposed the evil deeds of the murderers, causing women across the country to cry out in unison for Zou Yue'e's tragic death, but paper cannot contain fire. It is more necessary to study it as a typical rape and murder case, to find ways to prevent similar tragedies from happening elsewhere, and to severely punish the murderers, so as to prevent the troublemakers from having a precedent to follow, and so on.

If this can be done, then the death of one Zou Yue'e will win the lives of hundreds of Zou Yue'es. For Zou Yue'e herself, although she may die with her eyes unclosed, she will ultimately find a way out for her sisters who are also trapped in the quagmire.

In a world where bestiality is rampant, the fate of women is originally tragic. Being raped, killed, robbed, trafficked, insulted... this is the "duty" of most women. In some areas, the value of a girl may not even be worth two or three catties of pork. The most pitiful are those weaker individuals with a bit of beauty. Like goods, they become the spoils of people. The aristocratic playboys and lechers do not allow a chaste woman to be by their side. They have special preferences, and there are not many who dare to resist them, let alone if you are just a weak woman. Zou Yue'e was an extremely self-respecting woman, and this "self-respect" happened to be extremely hated by the lechers, so it became the main reason for Zou Yue'e's murder. "If you cannot fight for it by force, then you will not hesitate to destroy it." The murderers in the Tongli Town tragedy can be said to have firmly adhered to this dogma.

Similar to the Tongli Town tragedy but with a different outcome is the case of Shi, a company commander in Peilei Town, Southern District, Yiwu, who forced Yang Chunhua, a weak woman, to be raped at gunpoint. Although Yang Chunhua escaped from the tiger's den and appealed to the press, gaining the sympathy of the Yiwu police chief, county magistrate, youth league secretary, and other local officials, it was still to no avail. "A few days ago, the woman's family members, unable to bear the man's threats, rushed to the county town, and her seventy-year-old grandmother and biological mother knelt before her, begging her to endure the humiliation for the sake of their lives and the lives of the entire family..." Yang Chunhua re-entered the tiger's mouth.

A small company commander unexpectedly has so much power. Does this situation illustrate "weapons first" or confirm that the remaining feudal forces in China cannot be underestimated?

A. Gide mentioned the story of aquatic creatures in the sea in "The Counterfeiters":

"Some fish cannot survive in water that is too salty or too fresh, while other fish are just the opposite. They can adapt to all levels of saltiness, so they wait at the edge of less salty currents, waiting for those fish that cannot withstand it to drift over and swallow them all..."

Aquatic creatures in the sea are like this, and humans are no exception. The likes of company commander Shi are just cunning fish that are better able to adapt to the feudal situation in China.
