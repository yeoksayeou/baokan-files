### Joint Land and Air Defense of Jilin and Changchun; Recovery of Changtu County in Northern Liaoning; Two National Army Routes in Western Liaoning Join Forces in Yixian

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th] Amidst the biting cold, Jilin and Changchun stand firm. The valiant land and air forces of the National Army in the Northeast are determined to defend these two key cities, exerting unparalleled strength. The communist bandits, facing this fortress of steel, can only yearn from afar and are now using their last manpower.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 30th] The battle situation in Jilin has suddenly become tense in recent days. Since yesterday, it can be said that the National Army has entered a difficult stage, but with the cooperation of land and air forces, the bandits will ultimately not succeed. Xiaobaishan was once briefly occupied by bandits yesterday. The bandits in the northwest suburbs of Changchun, after repeated attacks by the National Army yesterday and today, show signs of collapse. The suburbs were peaceful last night.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] The opportunity to encircle and annihilate the invading bandits outside Changchun is gradually maturing. The Fourth Independent Division of the bandits in West Manchuria may play the leading role as the target of the National Army's encirclement and annihilation. Over the past 24 hours, the bandits' movements do not seem to have moved beyond the reorganization stage. There has been no fierce fighting in the northwest corners. The advance troops of the bandits have been discovered in Zhao Jiaying and Mao Jiawopeng, 15 li northwest of Xiaonan Station in the northern suburbs of Changchun. Military officials here say that, given the current troop strength in Changchun, the bandits' attempt to invade Changchun is truly the most ridiculous dream.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th] The National Army in Yongji has achieved brilliant results. The 29th Division (formerly the Third Independent Division) of the bandit's Tenth Column launched another fierce attack on the National Army positions outside Yongji on the evening of the 28th. The defending troops immediately rose up to meet the attack, fighting fiercely all night. By dawn on the 29th, the bandits' momentum had been frustrated, and they gradually retreated. Just as our air force arrived, it unleashed its power in the skies above the battlefield, repeatedly bombing and strafing the ground troops of the bandits. The defending troops also seized the opportunity to attack. The bandits suffered nearly total casualties, and high-ranking cadres below the bandit division commander were killed. The bandits' 26th Column and 1st and 2nd Independent Divisions, who had infiltrated Jilin South's Xiaobaishan and Tuanshanzi areas, also suffered heavy casualties and are now fleeing in the southeast and northwest directions of Yongji.

[United Press, Changchun, 30th] The military position of Changchun is far more solid than people in Beijing and Shanghai had expected. The New First Army, trained by the United States and China, and the local "Security Forces" are holding the city. Contrary to rumors, the New First Army still has ample ammunition for its American weapons. In addition to existing stockpiles, the Shenyang Arsenal is also able to manufacture American military supplies, so there is no fear of shortages.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th] The bridgehead on the north bank of the Songhua River, 240 li north of Changchun, which is isolated, is still firmly held by the National Army. The defending troops have ample food and ammunition, and the communist bandits have not dared to face it head-on.

They first captured Changtu Railway Station and then Changtu County (more than ten kilometers northwest of the railway station) on the afternoon of the 29th. Communist bandits between Changtu and Siping fled in panic upon hearing the news. There are now no traces of bandits between Tieling and Siping. The National Army in western Liaoning, which rushed from Jinzhou to support Yixian, joined forces in Yixian on the 29th. The repair team for the Jinzhou-Gubei Line crossed Xuejia Station and reached Shangqitai.

### Key points of revision

Chapter 1 General Principles, no revisions except for Articles 2 and 8. Article 2 Paragraph 2: "Magazines use a fixed name and keep being issued every week or every 3 months. But if the content is mainly about current events, it will be considered a newspaper.” The revised text is: “Magazines use a fixed name, bind them and the issue frequency will be between 6 days and 3 months.” The original explanation of this paragraph has been removed this time. Article 8 stated the publication must be handed in to many different organizations. This has been revised and split into Article 16 and Article 19 in Chapters 2 and 3. Article 8 has been newly added. The content is: "Foreigners may apply to issue publications in accordance with the provisions of this law and abide by all laws and regulations of China regarding publications, but if the publication law of the foreigner's home country has differential treatment for Chinese people, they should not enjoy the treatment granted by this law." This article is based on the principle of equality and reciprocity in international relations and need no more explanations.

The main revision about the registration of newspapers and magazines in Chapter 2 involves Article 9. The revision reduces the approval time for newspapers and magazines. This shows the government is convenient to the publication business. The statement “After issuing the registration certificate, the Ministry of Internal Affairs must copy the registration application to the Central Propaganda Department” has been removed. Since the end of the tutelage, the implementation of the publication law has been transferred to government agencies. Political parties no longer participate. Article 9 Paragraph 1: “The publisher of a newspaper or magazine must submit an application form before the first issue. The local authority where the publishing location will submit the application to the Provincial Government or the Municipality directly under the Executive Yuan within 15 days. The Provincial Government or the Municipality directly under the Executive Yuan should approve it within 28 days and ask the Ministry of Internal Affairs to issue a registration certificate.” The revision changes “15 days” and “28 days” to “10 days” to shorten the approval period by one time. The phrase “Except for special circumstances” has been changed to “Approved according to the rules” to make the wording precise. The content in the back of Article 9 is the matters that the registration application must contain. Only the “Purpose of Publication” has been added. The rest has not been revised.

Article 12 of Chapter 2 states: "If a newspaper specializes in publishing communications, the local authority may send personnel to inspect its social organization and publishing status when necessary." After the revision, this article has been removed in order to fully protect the freedom of the press from any unnecessary administrative interference. Articles 13 to 16 have been moved up and changed to Articles 12 to 15. Article 14 (Article 13 of the revised text): "One who has been criminally punished for violating Article 21" has been changed to "One who has been criminally punished for violating Articles 21 and 22." Article 22 is a new article in Chapter 4. In addition, the provisions of the original articles in Chapter 2 have not been modified.

Chapter 3 About books and other publications, original articles 18 to 20. Article 20 states that “Political leaflets or slogans must not be printed or issued without the permission of the local authority.” This article has been removed to be in line with the spirit of freedom of speech. Also, Article 19 was added stating that the publisher must send 1 copy of the book to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the National Central Library and the Beiping library. Article 8 of the current Publication Law says all publications must be sent to many organizations. The amendment determines the publication to send according to their properties to reduce the number of copies that the publisher needs to send. (Continued in Column 1, Edition 2)

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Legislative Yuan held the 337th regular meeting on the morning of the 30th, presided over by President Sun, and discussed various election-related cases. First to discuss was the temporary motion of Legislator Liu Guanting and others, suggesting that "the Legislative Yuan shall resolve that the National Government shall notify all political parties that all current legislators, unless they voluntarily give up the election, shall be nominated and supported by all political parties as candidates for Legislative Committee." During the discussion of this case, legislators of the Kuomintang spoke enthusiastically, and legislators of the Min and Qing parties also spoke in support. They all agreed that current legislators are experienced experts with rich knowledge and should not be rejected. At the same time, current legislators are formally appointed after being selected by the Political Conference, the Supreme National Defense Council, and the National Defense Conference. Since they are nominated by political parties, legislators should be on the support list of various political parties. At the same time, parliaments in various countries retain a portion of the old members in each re-election. Even if all current legislators are elected, it would still be less than one-fifth of the total. Furthermore, legislators have continuity and technicality, and current legislators should be nominated as candidates for future legislators. It was passed without objection.

### Female Legislator Candidates; Not Just Filling Numbers

Following was the discussion of the proposal by Legislator Tan Tiwu and others, that female legislators should be based on academic qualifications, experience, and social status as standards, and should not be filling numbers based on personal relationships. They suggested that the National Government should notify all parties to pay attention to this point when submitting the list of candidates. During the explanation of the original proposal, Tan Tiwu pointed out that the female legislator candidates nominated in various places were of uneven quality, and there were questions about their academic qualifications and experience. They were often produced based on personal relationships and did not value talent. This election is extremely important for our future constitutional prospects, and attention should be paid to this phenomenon. Zhong Tianxin and others believed that no one should avoid relatives in internal recommendations. If they are truly talented, relatives and friends may also propose them. Finally, the original proposal was passed.

Then, the following were passed: *Revised Implementation Regulations for the Election and Recall of Representatives of the National Assembly and Legislators, including the format of the election certificate and the description of the election ballot.* *The number of signatures of candidates from the five groups of freelance journalists, lawyers, technicians, accountants, doctors, and pharmacists has been reduced to at least 50 people.*

Finally, the remedial measures for the difficulty of electing representatives to the National Assembly and legislators in the pacification area were discussed. During the review, a draft supplementary regulation for the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators was drafted. During today's meeting, there was a fierce debate about whether the representatives should be re-elected after the pacification area was recovered. Most of the northern legislators agreed that there was no need to re-elect after the election had been held in order to disturb the local area. President Sun and others pointed out that the people have the right to vote and be elected and cannot be deprived of it. It was decided to resubmit for review. (Revised articles of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, etc., are published in Column 2, Edition 2)

Authoritative sources told reporters that the assistance granted to China under this agreement is the beginning of a series of friendly aid efforts. Although the White House still focuses most of its attention on European affairs, and even believes that China still needs to undertake certain reforms to fully qualify for assistance, it has indeed heard the voices of the people and knows that the overall situation in the Far East can no longer be delayed. Although General Wedemeyer's report and aid plan recommendations have not been published, they cannot delay the awakening of American public opinion. The American public has begun to face the crisis in the Far East and is concerned about the situation in China. The U.S. government will surely understand public opinion and actively strengthen its aid to China. The source could not confirm the reports that the first batch of U.S. aid planes and munitions had already begun shipping to China, but they definitely stated that the negotiations between China and the U.S. on a loan to stabilize China's currency system have made considerable progress. The amount of this loan, if based on Bullitt's suggestion, would be $150 million, but the exact number is currently a closely guarded secret. According to reporters' inquiries, U.S. aid to China will be provided in stages, with the first batch totaling approximately $100 million, and subsequent batches will be determined gradually and arrive continuously.

[United Press Washington, 29th] Under Secretary of State Lovett announced at a press conference today that a decision on U.S. policy toward China could be made as soon as Secretary of State Marshall returns to Washington from the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

### Editorial: Burmese Independence and Sino-Burmese Relations

Since India and Pakistan gained independence, the Burmese people have also actively moved towards independence, completing another bloodless revolution in history. According to London sources, the Burmese delegation, led by Prime Minister Nu, signed the Anglo-Burmese Treaty with British Prime Minister Attlee on October 17th, stipulating that Britain will transfer power to the independent new Burmese government in January next year. On the 24th, the British Parliament convened, and Attlee proposed the Burmese Independence Act, which smoothly completed the legislative procedures. On the 26th, the British Secretary of State for Burmese Affairs, Listowel, officially announced the "Burmese Independence Act" and the "Anglo-Burmese Treaty." The Act stipulates that Burma will become an independent nation from January 6th next year, neither a part of the British Commonwealth nor under British protection. The treaty recognizes the Burmese Republican Federation as a fully independent sovereign state, with both sides appointing appropriate diplomatic representatives. The British Burmese Affairs Department will also be closed on January 6th next year. At the same time, the treaty stipulates the Anglo-Burmese military relationship, with Britain enjoying special interests in the military, and Burma not accepting any country's defense representatives. The Anglo-Burmese trade relationship will adopt a reciprocal approach, similar to the U.S.-Philippines treaty relationship. But in any case, this is a historical event with new significance. The enlightened British government has fulfilled its promise to abandon its colonial policy, adding luster to the spirit of the Atlantic Charter; and the Burmese nation has completed its mission of national liberation and national independence in the bloodless revolutionary process of India and Pakistan, which is equally worthy of our celebration.

Burma is located at the narrowest point of the Malay Peninsula, and its continental borders are closely connected with our country. According to the 1940 League of Nations Yearbook, Burma has an area of ​​261,610 square miles and a population of 16 million, including Burmese, Karen, Shan, Indian, and Chinese people. Its transportation with India is mainly through the port of Rangoon. The Burmese people are the most dynamic ethnic group in Southeast Asia and are accustomed to farming, earning them the early title of "Land of Bliss" in Asia. This industrious nation has its ancient history; from the sixth to seventh centuries AD, it was a feudal fiefdom individually established by nobles. From the eleventh to thirteenth centuries, the feudal lords were positioned among the merchant class, not only establishing huge cities, but also establishing business connections with southern China and Nanyang, and establishing a powerful national kingdom. At that time, Buddhism was also introduced from India, and culture gradually developed. Until the fourteenth century, it still maintained its independence. In its external relations, Burma defeated the invasion of the Mongol Empire; it was not until the nineteenth century that it was defeated in three wars against Britain and became a colony of the British Empire. The tragic fate of the Burmese nation began at this time.

The British Empire regarded Burma as "the pearl in the British crown." For the rule of India, Hong Kong, and Malaya, it had to occupy Burma. At the same time, in order to compete with France in the Far East, it did not hesitate to invest gold pounds in operating Burma. In 1886, Burma was declared a part of the British Empire and incorporated into India. At the same time, the British Empire, in order to implement the traditional policy of "divide and rule," divided Burma into upper and lower regions, establishing a collection of dozens of small kingdoms into a federation, similar to the technique of ruling India. In 1937, based on the recommendations of the Simon Commission, the separation of India and Burma was implemented, directly under the management of the British Emperor, with a Burmese Affairs Department set up internally to guide the administration of the Governor of Burma; under the Governor was a Burmese Parliament, divided into upper and lower houses. Therefore, Burma was neither a colony nor a dominion, but a semi-autonomous territory of the British Empire. The Burmese nation is full of vitality. Although they were dissatisfied with British rule, they contributed manpower and materials to the Allied countries during this war, and provided territory and airspace for the Allied forces to fight against Japan. Even under Japanese occupation, they were unyielding. After the war ended, the British Labour Party came to power. Burma's independence, following Egypt and India, is not only a wise move by the British government, but also an inevitable trend in post-war world politics. Looking at the British government and Parliament's rapid and decisive decision, the British sincerity in receiving Nu, although the crown of the British Empire has lost its brilliant pearls, it has added world friends on the road of self-reliance in the new Britain, and left the most memorable page in the national liberation movement. We really admire the far-sighted and courageous approach of British politicians.

We are particularly excited about Burma's independence. The future independent diplomatic relations between China and Burma will surely increase day by day, which will be conducive to the stability and prosperity of both countries. In history, Sino-Burmese relations have a very glorious chapter; geographically and strategically, the two countries have a relationship of sharing weal and woe. The Sino-Burmese border area, adjacent to Yunnan and Xikang, has three major rivers (Nujiang, Lancangjiang, and Jinshajiang), and it encompasses the areas of Pianma, Jiangxinpo, etc., which are related to our country's southwestern border and are also a fortress for our southwestern national defense. Its gains and losses are of great importance to our country's destiny. Unfortunately, boundary disputes have occurred from time to time over the years, so the Sino-Burmese border has not yet been demarcated, and as a result, commercial exchanges between the two countries also lack normalcy. Now that Burma has gained independence, our country has exchanged ambassadors with it, and the boundary demarcation issue is also in progress, which is a prelude to the improvement of Sino-Burmese relations.

We congratulate Burma's independence and hope for the success of Burma's constitution-making and its path to democracy and freedom. The stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia hinge on the future friendship between China and Burma. Our country's ancient world policy has always regarded "reviving extinguished states, continuing interrupted lineages, and generous gifts and meager returns" as an ideal. Looking at today's world, given the geographical and strategic importance of China and Burma, we deeply hope that the new Burma will choose the path of Sino-Burmese cooperation and friendship, break the stalemate of Sino-Burmese boundary disputes over the years, and then rebuild Sino-Burmese commercial relations. Southeast Asia is a land of kindness and compassion. We wish that the two peoples of China and Burma will cooperate friendly and forever bathe in the sea of peace and tranquility!

### Dong Xianguang Talks About the Publication Law

(Continued from Page 1) Chapter 4, regarding the restrictions on the matters to be published in publications, in addition to the change in the order of the articles, the content includes the modification of two articles and the addition of two articles. Article 21 of the original text stipulates: "Publications shall not record any of the following statements or propaganda: 1. Those who intend to destroy the Kuomintang or oppose the Three People's Principles; 2. Those who intend to subvert the National Government or harm the interests of the Republic of China; 3. Those who intend to disrupt public order." The revised article is as follows: "Publications shall not record any of the following statements or propaganda: 1. Those who intend to subvert the government or endanger the Republic of China; 2. Those who harm diplomatic relations; 3. Those who intend to harm public interests or disrupt social order." Article 22, a "newly added article" in the amendment, stipulates: "Publications shall not record anything that damages the reputation of the head of state of this country or friendly countries." Article 24, a "newly added article," stipulates: "Publications shall not record anything that damages the reputation and credibility of others." The addition of Article 21, paragraph 2 and Article 22 aims to promote the consolidation of diplomatic relations and express due respect to the heads of state of this country and friendly countries. In addition to protecting freedom of speech, the Publication Law also takes into account the protection of private reputation to prevent the prevalence of defamation, so Article 24 has been added. In addition, Article 23 of the original text of Chapter 4, that is, Article 25 of the amendment, after being revised, adds "Publications shall not criticize events that are in the process of litigation" to the original provision that "Publications shall not publish debates on cases in which public litigation is prohibited," so as to protect the dignity of the judiciary. Article 26 of the amendment, that is, the original Article 24, has not been modified in content. Its significance is to reserve the power that the government should have in wartime or in the event of turmoil. It is not true that the revised Publication Law is tantamount to restoring the newspaper censorship system.

Chapter 5, Administrative Penalties, in addition to the change in the order of the articles, the content includes the modification of five articles, the addition of one article, and the deletion of three articles. Article 30 of the amendment (original Article 28) and Article 36 (original Article 34) have been modified as follows due to the change in the order of the articles and the addition of articles in Chapter 4: Article 30, if the Ministry of Interior believes that a publication contains one of the items listed in Article 21, or violates the prohibitions and restrictions stipulated in Articles 22 and 26, it may specify the item and prohibit the publication and distribution of the publication, and may seize it when necessary. (The latter part has not been revised and is the same as the latter part of the original Article 28).

Article 36, if the content of a publication violates the provisions of Article 23, Article 24, or Article 25, and the circumstances are serious, the Ministry of Interior or the local competent authorities shall, after submitting it to the Ministry of Interior for approval, prohibit its sale and distribution, and may seize it when necessary. (The latter part has not been revised and is the same as the latter part of the original Article 34). In addition, Article 37 (original Article 35) regarding the case of the publisher stipulates the punishment that should be imposed for sending its publications. The current article stipulates a fine of 30 yuan, which has been changed to "If the publisher fails to comply after being urged, a fine of more than 50 times the price of the publication shall be imposed." In addition, the fine stipulated in Article 38 (original Article 39) has been changed from "100 yuan" to "1,000 yuan" after revision, and there are no other modifications. Article 33 of the amendment, regarding publications issued abroad that should be prohibited from import, is the original Article 31. Among them, there are only necessary modifications due to the change in the article number, and the substance is exactly the same as the original article.

Articles 36, 37, and 38 of the current Publication Law, which stipulate various fines, have all been deleted.

Chapter 5, Article 41 stipulates that "In addition to the penalties imposed separately in accordance with the above articles, those who violate the provisions of this Law and commit crimes stipulated in the Criminal Law shall be handled in accordance with the Criminal Law." Although this article is a newly added independent article in form, the first sentence of Article 34 of the current Publication Law also contains the same meaning.

Chapter 6 of the current Publication Law, Penalty Provisions, consisting of eleven articles, has been completely canceled. In other words, according to the draft amendment, if a person engaged in publishing violates the provisions of Chapter 4, the publication may be subject to administrative penalties, but the individual's punishment shall be handled in accordance with the Criminal Law and is not within the scope of administrative penalties. From this, it can be seen that the government intends to protect human rights and respect the spirit of the rule of law. Chapter 7 of the current Publication Law, Supplementary Provisions, has been changed to Chapter 6, and the content has not been modified. (End)

### Authorities Have Not Placed Key Members of the China Democratic League in North China Under Surveillance

"Our Peiping Dispatch, 30th" Zhang Shenfu, the person in charge of the North China branch of the China Democratic League, told reporters today: "Even if the government orders the China Democratic League to disband, we will immediately comply with the order to disband." Zhang said that he has not been subjected to surveillance, and said that he and others are frank and open-minded and have no fears. Members of the China Democratic League have no actions that harm the government, and the North China branch has no activities, is silent, and is equivalent to being disbanded. Another key member of the China Democratic League, Zhang Dongsun, is still teaching at Yanjing University. The North China authorities have not taken action against the members of the China Democratic League. It is reported that the handling method will be decided at the Executive Headquarters meeting tomorrow.

"Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th" Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei of the China Democratic League continued to visit Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and others on the 30th, requesting that they be allowed to lift the surveillance on them. According to Luo, they very much hope that the government will issue an order to disband the China Democratic League, because if the China Democratic League is regarded as an illegal national entity by the government, it will not be able to carry out activities, so it is better to disband it. It is reported that the government may take further measures in this regard.

### Shen Junru of the China Democratic League Transfers the Properties of the Communist Party Under Management to the Police Bureau

"Our Dispatch" The China Democratic League managed two properties of the Communist Party in Shanghai. Among them, the Zhou Enlai residence on Sinan Road was taken over by Chen Zhiqin, the director of the Lujiawan Police Branch Bureau, who led his troops there in person at 4:00 PM yesterday. Shen Junru of the China Democratic League came forward to handle the handover procedures. All the internal properties were used by the China Industrial and Commercial School and the Children's Welfare Fund Raising Association, so the Huangpu Branch Bureau was unable to take over yesterday and has reported to the superior authorities for instructions.

### U.S. Acting Secretary of State Talks About the Issue of China Banning the China Democratic League

"U.S. News Service, Washington, 29th" Acting Secretary of State Lovett was asked by someone at a press conference today to comment on the news of the Chinese government banning the China Democratic League. He said that he had received a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to China confirming the news. The State Department is currently trying to obtain a more detailed report.

[United Press Washington, 29th] Lovett said at a press conference that the United States will continue to take its consistent stance, that is, the United States should do its best to advise the Chinese government to grant the leaders of the China Democratic League a fair and public trial so that they have the opportunity to speak.

[United Press New York, 29th] Congressman Marcantonio of the Labor Party and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt had a debate on a radio broadcast last night. It is said that China's recent banning of the China Democratic League is the achievement of a "dictatorial government," but Bullitt said that the Chinese government declared the China Democratic League an illegal organization because it "is only the tail of the Communist Party."

### Shanghai Cultural Circles Hold a General Mobilization Meeting to Support the Government's Dissolution of the China Democratic League

"Central News Agency, This City Dispatch" The Shanghai Cultural Circles Save the Nation General Mobilization Association held a meeting in the afternoon of the 30th to invite people from the news and cultural circles to exchange opinions on the government's dissolution of the China Democratic League. More than 30 people from the cultural circles, including Fang Zhi and Feng Youzhen, attended. The Association also issued a declaration yesterday to support the government's banning of the China Democratic League. The declaration pointed out that the emergence of the China Democratic League was based on political speculation, with no ideology and no political program, so the center of gravity shifted at any time and the rhetoric was contradictory. When the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were negotiating, the China Democratic League considered itself a "third party." Until the Communist bandits openly rebelled, opposed the National Assembly, and opposed the Constitution, the League revealed its true colors, and all its claims were completely in tune with the Communist bandits. Furthermore, it instigated student unrest, incited worker unrest, opposed conscription, and opposed grain policy. Anything that the Communist Party found inconvenient or unable to come forward was handled by the League. In the bandit areas, it sent personnel to participate in the work of harming the country, driving good people into misery. In the rear, it chanted the so-called opposition to civil war. Overseas, it declared the overthrow of the government. In China, it deliberately distorted peace, advocating democracy everywhere, but in reality, it was creating turmoil. It talked about unity to everyone, but specialized in sabotaging laws and discipline.

### Sale of State-Owned Enterprises

(Continued from Page 1) The government designates national banks and invites banking organizations to form a fundraising syndicate, designating one or two banks as conveners. Their task is to sell the business units in accordance with government regulations, plan the organization of the new company each year, and handle the fundraising, collection, and transfer of funds for the new company's shares. The syndicate is located in Shanghai, with offices in various provinces and cities. Determine the reserve price for each business unit separately for sale, with the principle of organizing a new company for each unit. For each unit approved for sale, the syndicate shall determine the amount of capital of the new company as determined by the government's valuation, and publicly raise shares, which shall be supervised by the Supervisory Committee for the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises. After the syndicate has raised enough funds for each unit's shares, it shall immediately set a deadline to collect the funds and hand them over to the national treasury, and assist the new company's shareholders' meeting to generate the persons in charge of the new company and take over the business from the government. However, in order to speed up the sale of state-owned enterprises, it may first set a deadline to collect the funds that have been raised, hand them over to the treasury, and establish a new company after more than half of the shares have been raised. The shares that have not been raised will still be entrusted to the syndicate by the government for continued sale, and the price may be increased by the government at any time.

### Wartime Japanese Atrocities: More Than a Thousand Chinese Laborers Killed; Allied Headquarters Sends Personnel to China to Investigate Evidence

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 30th] Morrison, a legal advisor to the Judicial Department of the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo, came to Tianjin from Japan to investigate evidence of Japanese mistreatment of Chinese laborers. He is scheduled to go to Peiping on the 31st, and then fly to Shanghai and then to Tokyo. He told reporters about the tragic fact that more than a thousand pen laborers were tortured to death by the Japanese in a certain mining area in northern Kyushu, Japan in 1945. He said: At that time, more than a thousand Chinese laborers were transported from the concentration camp to a certain mining area in northern Honshu to work as forced laborers. More than 400 people died one after another due to hunger and illness. The remaining pen people, unable to bear the abuse, finally rioted on July 1, 1945, and beat several self-defense soldiers to death. Afterwards, the hundreds of Chinese were tied up under the pressure of bayonets and stood in the scorching sun, and were cut off from food and drink for five days, resulting in the deaths of countless people. When Morrison talked about this tragic past, he showed a stack of lists, but the Japanese mostly filled in the cause of death as "dysentery." Morrison hopes to obtain evidence of this Japanese atrocity in order to file a public prosecution against the abusers.

### Activities of the Democratic League in Shanghai

[Special dispatch from Dagong] The activities of the Democratic League members in Shanghai's labor circles in compliance with the law are excerpted as follows:

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the leaders of the Democratic League, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Zhang Bojun, and others came to Shanghai one after another, secretly instructing their followers to infiltrate Shanghai's labor circles and organize workers' associations, belonging to the National Salvation Association. Under the Workers' Association, there are two organizations: Company and Business Friendship Association and All Trades Alliance. In addition, it developed peripheral organizations and infiltrated other groups, such as the Youth Federation, Guangming Theater, and Amateur Opera Society, Qingguang Society, Youth Troupe, and various women's cram schools, workers' cram schools, etc. in the dense labor areas of East and West Shanghai. Although its Friendship Association and Alliance are organizations of the Democratic League, they are actually under the command of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions of the Communist Party of China. Before the withdrawal of the Communist Party of China, Li Xiongxiang, Guan Tianzhong, and Ge Qiying, the persons in charge of the Federation of Trade Unions, as well as Hua Gang, the person in charge of the Labor Department of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Jiachen, the person in charge of the Trade Union Department of the Communist Party of China, issued secret orders from time to time.

In the winter of the 34th year of the Republic of China, workers demanded adjustment of their treatment due to high prices. Therefore, members of the Democratic League seized the opportunity to instigate labor unrest in factories one after another, to achieve the purpose of destroying society and overthrowing the government.

In the second half of November of the 35th year, the Democratic League launched a signature campaign against the United States in the factories in East and West Shanghai, especially in Yizhong Fuxin Tobacco Factory, Chongxin Yarn Factory, Huaitong Woolen Mill, Jinglun Yarn Factory, and Yuanfeng Yarn Factory. At the same time, Ying Qi, a cadre of the Democratic League, repeatedly threatened Chen Jieru, a female cigarette worker (now a labor senator), to join the Democratic League and lead the anti-American work, but Chen refused.

After the beginning of this year, Luo Longji, Deng Chumin, and Guo Moruo, who were close to the Democratic League, secretly instructed their henchmen Chen Shijun, Wu Cheng, Ding Shengya, and others to convene a meeting to love and use domestic goods and resist American goods for many months. It was not until February 9th of this year that it was convened at the Quan Gong Building, and the Liang Renda blood case occurred.

On the day of the "February 9th" incident, Shen Junru, Zhang Bojun, Shi Liang, and others met with Han Wucheng, Ding Shengya, and others at their residence to discuss countermeasures. Shi Fuliang, who was left-leaning, personally drafted the propaganda for the Liang case, which was printed by Guoguang Printing House at No. 40, Lane 383, Dagu Road, and sent to various parties for distribution. The article "My Experience of Being Beaten" published by Ding Shengya in Wen Wei Po on February 23 was revised by Zhang Bojun and Shen Junru.

On June 15th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a secret order to the student and labor movement elements, instructing them to turn to underground labor movement in the future. The labor movement elements of the Democratic League also cooperated in carrying out the movement. During the months of July and August, the Friendship Association of the Six Public Utilities and the Trade Union of the Three District Department Stores convened meetings to secretly discuss the progress. First, the Democratic League in the power workers took the lead. On August 14th, when General Wedemeyer was about to arrive, they used the excuse of the capital preventing them from holding a labor-capital symposium and went on strike for three hours in the writing room on Nanliang Road. The Yangshupu Power Plant responded at the same time. The next day, the Feilun Road Power Plant also went on strike for half an hour. The lights in the Taoyuan Road Lizhi Society Reception Center, where General Wedemeyer was staying, were also destroyed by them and went out once.

The authorities then tried their best to investigate and found reactionary documents printed by the Democratic League in Futong Printing House on Weihaiwei Road on September 19th. Wu Kewen and others, the traitors of the Power Workers' Union, were also inside, and they were arrested. At this point, the Democratic League members hiding in the trade unions of various public utilities were greatly panicked, so they made a desperate move, launching labor unrest in British and French companies and power companies through Ouyang Zirun of the Power Workers' Union, Chen Shijun of the Three District Department Stores, Zhu and Liu of the French companies. After frequent suppression, an order to reorganize the Power Workers' Union was issued on September 25, expelling 29 reactionary elements such as Wu Kewen. On September 29, the French Concession Power Workers' Union was reorganized, expelling 10 workers such as Zhu Xinxin. On September 30, the Three District Department Store Trade Union was reorganized and Chen Shijun, Ding Shengya, and other 10 people were arrested. This matter came to an end.

The telegram from UN Secretary-General Lai Yi was also announced during the meeting. In the Anglo-American tariff agreement, the United States agreed to reduce import duties on whiskey, wool, automobiles, and textiles, while the United Kingdom promised to reduce or exempt certain imperial trade preferences it enjoyed.

### Regarding the Soviet Union's Proposal on the Korean Issue, the United States Proposes an Amendment, Advocating the Establishment of a Provisional Committee to Investigate Korea First

[American News Agency, Lake Success, 29th] The United States today supported the Soviet Union's proposal to urge the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to invite representatives of the Korean people to participate in the Committee's discussion of the issue of Korean independence, but added an amendment to ensure that these representatives are not solely "appointed by the Korean military authorities." The Soviet Union's proposal was to request the Political Committee to invite "representatives of the Korean people."

However, Australia, China, and Haiti all expressed support for the United States' proposal.

### Gun-Wielding Robbers Hijack Car and Wreak Havoc; They Are Unable to Escape in Front of the Municipal Police Bureau and Are Arrested and Tried; They Still Attempt to Seize a Gun

[Report from this newspaper] A Russian woman named Heicha, lives in a foreign-style house at 68 Yongfu Road. She opened the Meili Company in the Overseas Chinese Bank Building on Central Road, dealing in coal. Recently, she purchased a 1947 Chevrolet champagne sedan, license plate number 53936, and hired a driver named Zhan Shiming. Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, Heicha was having lunch at home, and the car was parked in the garden, with driver Zhan Shiming sitting inside. Suddenly, a robber wearing a light gray suit and thick glasses jumped into the car, pulled out a gun, and threatened the driver to drive towards Hongqiao Road. The driver was forced to follow the indicated route. When they reached a remote area of Hongqiao Road, the robber pushed Zhan out of the car and drove away himself. Later, Zhan walked back and reported the situation to the Xujiahui Police Station. Branch Chief Song Anmin sent police officers to search for the car in all directions and contacted the owner, Heicha, who urgently called the company and ordered employee Ding Yuanhai to accompany her to the police station. While Ding was in a rented car passing Xizang Road, he suddenly saw car number 53936 heading north, turning towards Fuzhou Road. Ding quickly turned the car around and chased after it. Near the Xiaocai Chang market on Zhejiang Road, he tried to intercept the car, but the robber inside noticed him and drove forward, disregarding everything, causing the tricycle in front of him, number 13765, to overturn. When he drove to the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road, on the east side of the Municipal Police Bureau, he encountered a red light, and a trolleybus number 359 was stopped on Jiangxi Road. The car, due to excessive speed, damaged the rear of the trolleybus. Soon after, Ding Yuanhai arrived in his car and reported to guards Sun Jianhua (131), Dai Chuan (216), and Chen Dingxin (189) of the Municipal Police Bureau, who intercepted the car. The robber attempted to draw his gun to resist arrest, but fortunately, the police were vigilant and held him back. The robber then pulled out another gun from his left pocket and attempted to fire, but one of the police officers tackled him to the ground, grabbing his legs, and he was finally subdued. Two .38 caliber revolvers and twenty-eight bullets were confiscated. After being taken to the police station, the head of the security section, Lu Dagong, personally interrogated him. The robber remained defiant and pretended to be the owner of the car. During the intense questioning, he unexpectedly grabbed a gun from the table and attempted to commit suicide, but fortunately, the gun was not loaded, and it was taken away from him. He confessed his name as Chen, from Guangdong, 23 years old, and admitted to the car robbery. He was later transferred to the criminal investigation department for further investigation.

### The Performing Arts Industry Does Not Accept Winter Relief Dues Added to Ticket Prices

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Winter Relief Association intends to raise funds for disaster relief by adding a 20% winter relief due to the ticket prices of various entertainment businesses. Yesterday morning, Yuan Wenzhang, the fourth director of the Social Affairs Bureau, convened a meeting with persons in charge of the drama and film industries to discuss the matter. Both industries expressed reluctance. Representatives of the Peking opera industry stated that various Peking opera theaters are facing difficulties in maintaining operations due to high expenses. Theaters such as Tianchan and China must sell 80% of their seats to break even, and many smaller theaters are suffering losses and relying on high-interest loans to stay in business. Adding another 20% donation would definitely affect their business. Representatives of the film industry also stated that the fundraising for the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi has just ended, and the business of movie theaters is not as good as before. Adding another 20% donation would affect their business. Both industries suggested raising donations in other ways, such as charity performances, etc. Director Yuan proposed reducing the donation to 10% and trying it for half a month to see how it affects business before deciding whether to continue. However, the industries still expressed their inability to accept this. After two hours of discussion without a result, Director Yuan said that he would wait for the director of the Social Affairs Bureau to return from Beijing before discussing the matter further.

### "Interrogation" of Xiaodan Gui Under Fatigue; Pushing for Confessions All Night Plants the Seeds of Disaster; Zhang Chunfan's 10,000-Word Confession Accuses Leng Shan of Alienating Affections; Shackled with Hands Behind His Back, He Appears Weak and Is Escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office Awaiting Interrogation

[Report from this newspaper] After the Yue opera actress Xiaodan Gui committed suicide by taking poison, Zhang Chunfan, the manager of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, was suspected of abuse. After more than ten days of interrogation by the police bureau, Zhang was suspected of inciting suicide. Yesterday morning at 11:15 AM, Deputy Section Chiefs Ma Feimu and Chen Xianrong escorted Zhang, along with ten officers, and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office. Zhang was wearing a dark-colored long gown, and his hands were shackled behind his back. He appeared weak and exhausted. The court session began at 4:30 PM. Prosecutor Chen Shoutao briefly questioned him and ordered him to be detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center for further interrogation at a later date.

According to Zhang Chunfan's informant: "I have never understood why Xiaodan Gui wanted to commit suicide. After her death, I didn't want to make the matter public, but my sworn sisters forced me very hard and insisted that I tell them the reason for her suicide. The cause of this incident was Leng Shan's alienation of my relationship with Xiao," and so on.

In the confession written by Zhang at the police station, which was over 10,000 words long, he placed the blame on Leng Shan and tried his best to avoid words such as abuse and humiliation. The following is an excerpt from his original text: "I came to Shanghai in 1919 and worked as a silk weaver in the Shanghai Weaving Factory in Chunyangli, Beikai'er Road. About half a year later, I became the manager of the Meili Silk Factory in Zhiyangli, Huishan Road, and was also a shareholder (accounting for one-third of 1,000 yuan). After a year, I rented out three iron weaving machines in the factory and bought two more machines, cooperating with Lao Zhennan. After more than a year in the Meili factory, the lease expired, and I took back the machines and merged them. Lao withdrew. Two years later, I rented 18 machines from the Guangqin Silk Factory on Tianbao Road and started work, serving as manager. After about seven or eight months, the Guangqin Factory failed and the lease was terminated. Because the houses in Zhiyang Road were taken back for personal use, they were all moved to Rihua Lane, Qiwupu Road, and renamed Risheng Silk Factory, with me serving as manager. I returned to my hometown during the Anti-Japanese War in 1926. Half a year later, I came to Shanghai again and saw that although the factory had been damaged by bombs, the machines were still there. I rented it to Hu Qiusheng, which had been going on for half a year.

### Meeting Xiaodan Gui

Two months before the Anti-Japanese War, my fellow villager Zhu Zhimin invited Yue opera actresses to Shanghai for a hall performance to celebrate Fa Hang's birthday. Through the introduction of my friend Chen Rongchun, I met Xiaodan Gui. In the spring when Xiao was 22 years old, she and I became romantically involved. I married a woman from my hometown, Qiu Ruixuan (currently 33 years old), at the Mengyuan Hotel in Shanghai in 1925, and we now have four sons and two daughters. Xiaodan Gui is currently 28 years old. Her younger sister Qiong Yun was married to Wang Yueqing, an employee of the Tiantian Silk Factory Publishing House, in the second half of last year by Song Hua as matchmaker. I manage the front desk affairs of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater every day, and I am also responsible for the scriptwriting department. On the 7th of this month, around 5:00 PM, I was not at home, and Xiao went out alone. She did not return until around 11:00 PM. I returned home that day around 12:00 PM. However, I had returned home once around 6:00 PM and asked Xiao's sister because I didn't see Xiao. According to her, she went out around 5:00 PM in the afternoon. When I returned home around 12:00 PM, I asked Xiao where she had gone for dinner. She replied, "I had dinner at Yu's mother's house, and after dinner I went to see a movie with Yu's mother." I said, "Yu's mother is watching a play in the Guotai and has talked to me backstage." After thinking about it carefully, I realized that what she said was wrong. Xiao always said that she watched a movie with Yu's mother. When I said no, she said yes, so we argued a few sentences. I insisted on asking, and as a result, Xiao said, "The Yue opera fan who often writes letters (who lives in the hardware store on Jiangxi Road) wrote to me and asked me to watch a movie at the Xinguang Grand Theater on the 7th." I asked what happened after the movie. Xiao said, "After the movie, I took a rickshaw to the Jindao Grand Theater." I asked Xiao, "Where did you eat dinner?" Xiao said, "I ate at the restaurant across from the Jindao." I asked her what she ate. Xiao said, "Not snacks, not rice, just ate something casually." I said, "I don't believe it. You can't see two movies the first time you meet." I advised her and asked, "Why do you want to go see a movie with him?" Xiao said, "Curiosity." I said, "That's not allowed. You'll be looked down on. What face will you have when people see you two sitting in a rickshaw? You're not singing anymore. Preserving your reputation is the most important thing." Xiao replied, "That's right." She said, "I'm wrong, I'm wrong. It's really not this person."

### Using Liu Qiong's Mailbox

I asked who it was. She said "okay" to me, got up, and went to the writing desk to write "Leng Shan" two words. I asked, "Where were you exactly?" Xiao said, "As long as my body is pure." She also said, "I went out around 5:00 PM and went to Jincheng to watch movies with Leng Shan. I hired a three-wheeled car to the back of the Firefly Theater and called a car to Zhao Zhuan Garden to stop, entered the road, and returned alone at 10:30." I asked, "Did you make the appointment by phone or by letter?" She replied, "By letter." I asked, "Where did these letters go through?" She replied, "Liu Qiong's mailbox." I asked, "Where is this mailbox?" She said, "On Masnan Road." I asked, "What did you talk about?" She said, "Leng Shan said he liked me very much, always loved me, spiritual love. I joked, I can't have love with you, you are a married man, and there are married women. Leng Shan said that his relationship with his wife was not good. I said, you loved her when you married her, why don't you love her now? It's okay to be friends with you, but love is absolutely impossible, and then we talked about filming a movie." I asked, "Did Leng Shan talk about me?" Xiao said, "Leng Shan said you have no sense of righteousness and are very stingy." I said, "How can you be so bold the first time you meet and talk about love? Tell me everything frankly." Xiao said, "When I do the play every night, Leng Shan helps me down, and we talk and talk every night, and feelings arise." I asked, "How many letters did you exchange?" Xiao replied, "Seven or eight." I asked, "What do the letters say? Where did the letters go?" Xiao said, "Don't ask me, I've already told you everything. Don't ask about the inside information in the letters, my body is absolutely pure." I said, "This is all a way to seduce you, deceive you. He has children. He is definitely cheating you out of your money and wants you to go to Hong Kong with him to make a movie." Xiao cried and said, "I'm awake." I said, "I'll discuss it with the scriptwriting department and tell him to make it clear, don't come and go, I'll call Liu Tao to come. (This was around 10:00 AM on the 8th, and we hadn't slept all night.)"

### Finding Leng Shan to Confront

Then find Liu · Wu Chen, and tell Wu, "Leng Shan alienated us, please say something fair." Together we went to Leng Shan's home near the Lanyin Theater. In the car, I said to Leng, "Don't leave us two couples, making it difficult for her to be a person, you say some bad things." When we got to my house, Xiao sat on the bed wrapped in a quilt. We sat down, and Leng Shan sat opposite me. I asked Leng Shan, "You have to tell the truth, she told me everything last night." Leng Shan said, "I watched a play at Jinmen with a friend last night, and there is a war ticket stub to prove it." I said, "Don't lie. Where did you make the appointment? Where did you hire a car? Where did you stroll around the road? Did you open a room? You can speak well, it doesn't matter. Mr. Wu is your old friend for more than ten years. It's inconvenient for you to speak directly. You can go to the outer room and tell Mr. Wu." When I pointed at him, I knocked his glasses crooked. He took them off and pulled me to the outer reception room, admitting "I made an appointment by letter, hired a car behind the Dahua Theater to Zhao Feng Park, and later Xiao hired a three-wheeler to come back alone, but there was absolutely no relationship." Later, I scolded Leng Shan, warning him not to come and go with Xiao in the future. After I said this, I let it go. Unexpectedly, Xiao was so stimulated that she had suicidal thoughts and swallowed a large amount of Lysol on the afternoon of the 13th. She was rushed to Zhongmei Hospital, but she was too poisoned and died at 6:00 PM. This is something I didn't expect. I feel deeply sorry for Dan Gui and regret it."

### Bai Lu's Wrongful Death Case Opens; Elevator Model Lawyer Explains

[Report from this newspaper] The case of the film star Bai Lu, who fell into the bottom of the elevator in the International Hotel on August 31 of this year, was seriously injured and died, was heard by Judge Zhong Xianda in the Second Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Whether the defendant Zhang Xilu was wearing black glasses, I don't know, but the glasses were not broken after the fall. If she had been wearing glasses, wouldn't they have been broken as well? Therefore, I don't think Bai Lu was wearing black glasses at the time. Then the elevator driver Zhang Xiliang of International No. 3, the defendant, testified: "I have been a driver at the International for eight years. The elevator is automatic. The door has two gears: the inner gear closes first, and the outer gear closes later. When the inner gear closes, the elevator goes up. At that time, elevator No. 3 was not damaged and had been inspected by the elevator repairman. I was above when the accident happened, and I didn't know." The court asked: Since the elevator has to wait for the inner gear to close before going up, how could Bai Lu get into the bottom? Zhang replied that the door was probably not completely closed, and Bai Lu pulled it open with her hand. Fujier, the manager of the International Hotel, testified: "On August 31, after hearing that someone had fallen, I went to investigate. The outer door of the elevator is usually closed with a gap of about four inches, and the elevator can go up. That day, I think Bai Lu pulled the outer door open and walked in with her hand." Liu Guangmao, the elevator repairman, said that the elevator had no problems. Finally, after the defendant's lawyer Eson explained the elevator model of the International Hotel, the court adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it. Next time, Tang Zhongqi, the waiter at the International Hotel who witnessed the scene, will be summoned to testify in court.

### Revival of Coastal Fisheries; Establishment of Fisheries Syndicate

The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in view of the severe damage to my country's coastal fisheries during the war, believes that if a revival is not sought immediately, it will have a profound and significant impact on the future of the fishing industry, the livelihood of fishermen, and local public security.

### Case of Embezzlement Accusation Against Postal Remittance Bureau Staff: District Court Held Hearing Yesterday, Chief Auditor Presented Five Points Regarding Investigation Results

[Our Report] The embezzlement case against staff of the Postal Remittance Bureau was heard yesterday at the District Court by Judge Wu Ronglin. The defendants present were Kong Guangxiao (Chairman of Lida Import and Export Company), Zhang Jiu (former Manager of the Chongqing Branch of the Postal Remittance Bureau, currently the Head of the Business Department of the Shanghai Branch, in charge of foreign exchange and overseas remittances), Ni Shurong (Director of the Savings Department of the Postal Remittance Bureau Secretariat), and Wang Xianghao (Staff Member of the Postal Remittance Bureau Loan Department, responsible for loan collateral). The nine defendants Shen Jing, Yu Zihong, Zhang Zhirong, Wu Yongnian, Chen Gongpei, Li Liangfu, Zhang Chunyi, Xu Jizhuang, and Peng Bingcheng were absent. Witnesses Zhou Yu, Wu Jiashan, He Jiayu, and Fang Jianbiao (Chief Auditor of the Postal Remittance Bureau Headquarters) were also summoned. First, Wang Xianghao testified: He initially worked on documentation at the post office, and since August of this year, he has been specifically managing mortgage collateral. However, whether the entire branch’s external collateral was handled solely by him is unclear. He also handled the Lida Company’s mortgage collateral, but he only checked whether the seals on the documents matched, and did not investigate the funds or quantity of goods on the collateral. Moreover, he was told to do so by the section chief, and he only stamped the documents after being instructed. Initially, he was very suspicious and did not understand why he was asked to stamp documents without knowing the mortgage recipient. The section chief explained that this was a confidential business procedure, so he did not inquire further. Shortly after the case occurred, Chief Auditor Fang from the headquarters came to investigate. Zhang Jiu testified: He was in charge of foreign exchange, overseas remittances, and communication with the Joint Treasury in the Shanghai branch. Because he was busy, he asked Ni Shurong for help, as Ni was an expert in foreign exchange research. The loan to Lida Company was approved by the director, who also gave specific instructions on how to proceed. Beforehand, Lida Company Manager Kong Guangxiao had reached an agreement with former Director Xu, and he initially proposed a monthly interest rate of 1.5% to be paid by Lida Company for the foreign exchange mortgage, as well as two shop guarantees. The Lida loan amounted to US$2 million (and he required a deposit of at least 30% of the total amount, and Lida paid US$600,000). Ni Shurong stated: He also managed the transfer of funds in the foreign exchange department, but did not know about the Lida foreign exchange mortgage. Kong Guangxiao stated: He contacted Xu Jizhuang for the foreign exchange mortgage from the Postal Remittance Bureau, and it was successful after one to three months. He intended to use this loan to purchase 10,000 tons of Western medicine from the US Army Shanghai Clearance Office. The Postal Remittance Bureau required him to use the Western medicine as collateral, and to repay the loan, including the US$600,000 deposit, from August to December. However, he still owed US$170,000, which was repaid with US dollar bonds. Next, witness Wu Jiashan testified: He had kept custody of Lida Company’s mortgage. On December 28th, he gave the mortgage to Kong Guangxiao on the order of Manager Shen (Jing). Zhou Yu (Accounting Department Staff) had prepared this voucher, but it was changed to Wang Xianghao due to an error. He Jiayu (Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Remittance Bureau) stated: He was not very clear about the matter upon joining the bureau. Fang Jianbiao presented five points regarding the investigation results: The Shanghai branch did not follow the rules for foreign currency mortgages. The bureau must submit a report to the headquarters for approval before conducting mortgage operations, but the Shanghai branch did so without reporting. The mortgaged goods never actually existed. The headquarters ordered Shen and Xu to explain the foreign exchange mortgage, but neither has provided an explanation to date. The mortgage exceeded the value of the collateral. As a result of the hearing, the case was adjourned for further hearing due to the absence of many witnesses. Kong Guangxiao provided five shop guarantees and a cash bail of 1 billion yuan. Zhang Jiu provided four shop guarantees and a bail of 400 million yuan. Ni Shurong provided two additional shop guarantees and a bail of 200 million yuan. Wang Xianghao provided an additional 200 million yuan and two shop guarantees.

### The Entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Transferred from Private to State Operation, Total Length 530 Kilometers, Promising Future for the Project

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 28th by Air] In 1936, when the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Company was first established, it signed a contract with Mr. M. Magot, a representative of a French bank. By 1937, the "alignment" survey for the entire 530-kilometer Chengdu-Chongqing railway line was completed, and the French side had shipped the first batch of 4,000 tons of railway materials from Paris. The materials were planned to be transshipped from Hong Kong to Sichuan. However, with the outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was delayed. The total budget for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project in 1937, according to a reporter's interview, was 75 million yuan. Although this year's budget has increased to 39 billion yuan, the person in charge of the project is still shaking his head, saying it’s not enough. Director Deng Yiguang went to Beijing on official business, and it was heard that the Executive Yuan recently approved an increase of 10 billion yuan per month for the Engineering Bureau starting in July. With the funds settled, if there are no unexpected problems, the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project can be completed in two and a half years. The section from Chongqing to Neijiang does not entirely follow the path of the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway (please refer to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway route map). All the large bridges and tunnels along the entire section were completed in 1940. Today, the main project is filling the roadbed. Because the hilly area requires extensive filling and deep excavation, up to 20 meters in some places, the Yu-Nei section, which is 280 kilometers long, requires 10,000 cubic meters of earth and stone. Construction of the Chongqing to Jiangjin section (60 kilometers) started five months ago and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Construction of the Jiangjin to Banqiao section (75 kilometers) started one month ago and is expected to be completed around April next year. The Engineering Bureau has decided to put the Banqiao to Neijiang section (150 kilometers) up for bidding on November 15th. However, at the Longchang Station in the Banqiao-Neijiang section, the bureau is using newly arrived American machinery to fill and excavate, testing how much faster the few machines are compared to manpower! As for the Neijiang to Chengdu section, it is 250 kilometers long (not passing through the mountainous area of Longquanyi Highway), and requires the construction of 13 tunnels and over 30 large bridges. West of Zizhong, the Liangfeng'ao Tunnel is the most challenging project, as it needs to be 500 meters long, and it will take a year and a half just to excavate it. Building the bridges is not too difficult, and the Engineering Bureau plans to start construction in the coming days. If all goes well, it can be completed before the flood season next year.

The French Shabano Bank came to Chongqing for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, but there was no result. The problem is how to calculate the French franc exchange rate in US dollars. It is said that there is currently a black market for the French franc, but the Shabano Bank hopes that the foreign material costs for the Engineering Bureau will be calculated at the official rate. However, the authorities believe that if ordering goods from France is valued according to the exchange rate set by the French, French goods will be much more expensive than American goods. This is the main reason for the delay in signing the contract.

A friend of the reporter went to the United States last year to inspect railway projects. In a train manufacturing plant, he met a representative of the French government who was negotiating with the American factory to order locomotives. After returning to China, he often doubted the production status of French industry. The reporter also asked a French friend about this issue. He frankly said: "Indeed, France has lost a war, but its recovery after victory is extremely fast. If the French government successfully signs a contract with the Chinese government for the entire Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project, France will definitely be able to deliver the goods in full within six months of signing the contract."

Currently, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been taken back under state operation, and the government is gradually refunding the previous private investments. As far as the reporter knows, it is not easy to rely on foreign industrial production to build a railway in the inland. During the peak flood season, the shipping capacity of the Sichuan River has never exceeded 30,000 tons, but a single-track 30-kilometer section of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway requires 1,000 tons of steel rails. For a total length of 530 kilometers, how many ships, cars, and airplanes are needed to coordinate transportation!

However, the person in charge of the Engineering Bureau still has his vision and ambition. Under all kinds of difficult circumstances, he not only wants to complete the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, but also wants to build the Longzhu section (from Longchang to Guiyang). If this section of the railway is completed, Chongqing to Longchang will become a branch line. Guiyang, Longchang, and Chengdu will become the main line, and the entire southwest transportation will be transformed. The Longzhu section is 520 kilometers long, and the Engineering Bureau has sent four survey teams and one reconnaissance team to carry out the "preliminary survey" along the line.

### The Origin of Chinese Culture: Lecture by British Expert in London

[British News Agency, London, 29th] Dr. Chattley delivered a highly interesting lecture here today at the China Society and the Chinese Universities Committee, entitled "The Origin and Propagation of Chinese Culture." The Chinese Ambassador to the UK chaired the lecture and praised Dr. Chattley for his extensive knowledge of China. It is reported that Dr. Chattley went to China to teach in 1908, and he came to the UK the following year to study. Over the subsequent decades, Dr. Chattley has held important positions related to China and has extensively studied Chinese culture. In his lecture, Dr. Chattley stated that for centuries, there have been constant explorations into the theory that Chinese culture originated in the West, but the theories of various schools of thought have failed to hold up after investigation. The most common argument is whether Chinese culture originated in Egypt. The conclusion of this question must first determine whether world culture originated in one place or developed independently in various locations. The doctor presented arguments for and against each theory. He stated that without extensive evidence, no single claim could be supported. He further mentioned that Egyptian culture can be traced back to 3,000 years ago, Phoenician culture to 2,000 years ago, Chinese culture to 2,000 years ago, and Central American culture to 500 years ago. This fact could indicate that culture originated in the Middle East and gradually moved eastward, crossing Asia and the Pacific to reach America. The differences in cultural patterns indicate regional developments. Dr. Chattley further pointed out that culture spreads through ideas to the world. Chinese culture, in many aspects such as porcelain, tea, paper, and printing, developed independently, but the invention of gunpowder and the compass remains to be investigated. He concluded by stating that most of Chinese culture originated from ideas. He further stated: "This theory is not intended to denigrate China but only to prove that world culture can only progress by strengthening and developing the connections between nations."

### 15th Routine Meeting of the Textile Adjustment Committee Passes Flower Purchase Price Negotiation Method, to Be Implemented in Six Districts Including Xi'an Starting Tomorrow

[Our Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee held its 15th routine meeting at 4 PM yesterday, chaired by Liu Siying. First, the secretary and business departments reported, followed by the chairman reporting on the situation of attending the National Economic Conference in Beijing last Thursday, providing information on the flower yarn cloth price negotiation and joint distribution. Finally, the following proposals were discussed: The Flower Purchase Price Negotiation Method Proposal. Wu Weijing, Liu Gongyun, Li Shengbo, Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai and others all raised opinions. After detailed discussion, the method was amended and passed. The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Union proposed to participate in the price negotiation group. It was resolved that when cotton cloth price negotiation is implemented, a representative from the replication industry will be nominated to attend. The Raw Material Supply Subcommittee appointed Hu Jingliang as the chairman of the subcommittee, with Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, Liu Jingji, Pan Fuzhen representing the Bank of China and the Central Bank, Zhen Xiang representing the Chinese Farmers Bank, Gao Bingtai representing the Textile Adjustment Committee, and Liu Xun representing the Shanghai Cotton Business Association as members. The method of weaving cloth on behalf of others was decided to be discussed at the next general meeting.

### Flower Purchase Price Negotiation Method

1.  This method is formulated in accordance with Article 2, Section 2, Chapter 1 of the Implementation Plan for Developing the Textile Industry and Adjusting the Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth.
2.  The joint intermediary price negotiation for flower purchase is temporarily implemented first in six districts, including Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Nantong, Hankou, and Shashi.
3.  Each of the above six districts shall establish a Cotton Price Negotiation Committee, jointly composed of representatives from the Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Central Bank's Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, the China Textile Construction Company, the China Farmers Bank, private yarn factories, and the Cotton Business Association, to jointly negotiate prices, with the representative of the Central Bank serving as the first convener and the representative of the Textile Adjustment Committee serving as the second convener. In Shashi and Nantong, where there are no Central Bank branches, the representative sent by the Textile Adjustment Committee is responsible for convening, and local government officials are invited to participate when necessary.
4.  The price at which cotton merchants purchase flowers from farmers in the place of origin is temporarily based on the price of one city dan of 1-inch fine velvet white flower, equivalent to the price of seven city zu of medium wheat (North) or four city shi of medium white rice (South). It shall still be negotiated at any time with reference to the local supply and demand situation and production costs. For cotton that is longer or shorter than 1 inch, the Textile Adjustment Committee shall formulate a price ratio standard and notify the local price negotiation committees for reference.
5.  The price negotiation for flower purchase in the distribution market is based on the price of the place of origin, and transportation and payment fees may be added appropriately. However, in order to reduce the layer-by-layer price increases of intermediaries and to make the price negotiation stable and reasonable, the transportation and payment fees shall be strictly limited.
6.  Water and adulteration of cotton seriously hinders the price negotiation work. In the future, the cotton in the market in various places must be qualified by the local cotton inspection agency before it is allowed to be bought and sold.
7.  The price negotiation committees in various places shall report the negotiated prices and the total quantity of flowers purchased by various manufacturers to the Textile Adjustment Committee every day by urgent telegram for verification. If there is no change in the negotiated price, it must also be reported.
8.  For flower purchase manufacturers who violate the price negotiation, the price negotiation committee may request the local government to ban them.
9.  This method shall be implemented on November 1, 1947, and shall be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record.

### City Market Flooded with Chips, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Weak, 42-Count Blue Phoenix Continues to Drop by 900,000

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw an abundant supply of chips due to the large amount of yarn released by textile factories the previous day. Coupled with tight credit conditions at the end of the month, demand from all parties was sluggish. Factories, in turn, engaged in selling, while buyers remained on the sidelines, causing quoted prices to steadily decline. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn fell by another 900,000 compared to the previous day, settling at 32.6 million. The prices of other counts of both coarse and fine yarns also uniformly decreased, ranging from 300,000 to about 1 million.

As for the cotton cloth market, initially, due to tight credit conditions, buyer activity remained limited, resulting in stable market conditions. However, around 11:30 AM, news of further declines in yarn prices dampened market sentiment, leading to a price slump. Eventually, various fine cloths, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, saw a drop of 5,000 compared to the previous day. Only a few batches of Five Blessings Blue Chicken saw increases of 5,000 to 10,000. Other cloths, due to sluggish sales, also experienced lackluster and lifeless market conditions.

Textile Factory Sales to the Market

[Our Report] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company, as usual, sold a total of 5,990 bolts of cloth, averaging 6,320 bolts per sales order. There were a total of 66 sales orders, including 6 orders from manufacturers purchasing 1,520 bolts and 60 orders with cloth numbers purchasing 4,470 bolts.

Spot Cotton Market Mediocre

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was mediocre with sporadic transactions. The trend was initially flat, then softened. Due to the narrow margins on cotton yarn and the urgent need for funds at the end of the month to pay wages, yarn factories showed little interest in purchasing. Dealers still had strong intentions to enter the market, so prices remained at their original levels. Total transactions for the day amounted to 880 bales. The factory delivery price for cotton from Shashi was 3.687 million, and from Guide it was 3.2241 million. The warehouse delivery price was 3.77 million for Bao, 3.357 million for Shandong, 3.224 million for fine Han cotton, 2.976 million for sharp Haitian, and 3.621 million for Shashi cotton. Qidong cotton was priced at 3.266 million, Huoji cotton at 2.5 million, and Zhoupu cottonseed at 600,050.

(D) Several suggestions on finance and foreign exchange were handed over to the Fiscal Equalization Fund Committee for consideration. In addition, opinions on price control were to be compiled by the Secretariat of the Economic Commission and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.

(2) The proposal to adopt a stock issuance method for the sale of state-owned enterprises and to organize a banking syndicate for fundraising was approved in principle. It was resolved to appoint eight committee members: Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, Yu Hongjun, Pan Xulun, Weng Wenhao, Xu Kan, and Huang Yuanbin, for review.

### National Banks to Strictly Supervise

The Auditing Department of the Central Bank investigated the number of bounced checks at the city's check clearing house, which had recently surged, reaching over 100,000, more than doubling the previous amount. The reason for this is that same-day checks can still be reused on the same day, leading to credit inflation and increased bounced checks. In addition, it was found that depositors were overdrawing their accounts without authorization after signing contracts with banks. If the bank's funds were insufficient, the overdraft checks would be bounced. Recently, it was also discovered that checks issued by depositors with sufficient funds were also being bounced. According to banking law, if a bank bounces a check for a depositor with sufficient funds, the bank should be liable for compensation, but currently, the bank only apologizes the next day. All these situations are sufficient to increase credit currency and disrupt the market. Therefore, the Central Bank has decided to further tighten control over the non-reuse of same-day checks. Banks must not bounce customer's cashier's checks under any circumstances. If a cashier's check is bounced, it will be treated as a sign of potential bankruptcy. After same-day checks are disallowed, bounced checks are expected to be reduced to zero.

National Bank Raises Interest Rates on Interbank Term Deposits and Changes the Unit to 100 Million Yuan

[Our Report] To encourage commercial banks to absorb social idle funds, the Central Bank introduced a type of interbank term deposit, with a unit of 500 million yuan, for a term of 10 days, with a monthly interest rate of 5%. Since its implementation, it is said that commercial banks have deposited a lot. However, recently, due to the increase in market interest rates, the Bankers Association requested an increase in deposit interest rates. The fixed amount of 500 million yuan was also considered inconvenient for banks with smaller deposits. It is now known that the National Bank has changed the unit of this deposit to 100 million yuan from October 25th, and the monthly interest rate has been increased to 8%. The authorities are planning to reorganize

Authorities Plan to Reorganize Northeast Circulation Certificates, New Taiwan Dollar to Remain Temporarily Unchanged

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] According to the Joint Credit Information Center, reliable sources have learned that the authorities plan to reorganize the current circulation certificates in the Northeast at an appropriate time and convert them into national currency. However, the reorganization of the New Taiwan Dollar is still pending because prices in Taiwan are stable and the province has abundant products. In terms of regional economy, whether it is internal trade or international trade, its trade status is in surplus. Therefore, the authorities are reluctant to make changes hastily to avoid affecting the province's current good economic situation.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Both Weak

The unofficial market for unified public bonds saw slight declines across the board. Large investors still had the tendency to push prices up to release their holdings, causing prices to retreat sharply after rising. Unified Class C bonds rose from 23,700 yuan to 24,500 yuan, but soon retreated to 20,900 yuan, and closed at 21,400 yuan at noon. This was a decrease of 1,600 yuan compared to the previous day. Class A and B bonds fell by 1,200 yuan, Class D bonds fell by slightly less than 1,300 yuan, and Class E bonds fell by 900 yuan. The total trading volume was about 6.7 million yuan.

The foreign stock market saw a slight rebound. While foreign firms were buying, securities firms were selling. Jardine Matheson saw a particularly strong decline. Ewo fell from 1,970,000 yuan to 1,900,000 yuan, and closed at 1,950,000 yuan at noon, a decrease of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous close. British American Tobacco fell by 9,000 yuan, Mengguang fell by 5,000 yuan, China Navigation, paper companies, and the brewery saw slight declines. Jardine Matheson fell by more than half a percentage point. Telephone traded between 115,000 yuan and 120,000 yuan, while Zhide traded between 35,000 yuan and 38,000 yuan.

### Principal and Interest of Expired British and American Gold Bonds Transferred to the National Treasury Bureau

[Our Report] It is learned that the 17th principal and 17th interest payment for the 27th year British Gold Bonds, the 17th principal and 17th interest payment for the 27th year American Gold Bonds, the 17th interest payment for the 27th year Customs Gold Bonds, the first tranche of bonds and the 11th principal and 15th interest payment for the 29th year Construction American Gold Bonds, the first tranche of bonds and the 11th principal and 15th interest payment for the 29th year Construction British Gold Bonds, the 17th principal and 17th interest payment for the 27th year National Defense Bonds, and the 8th principal and 11th interest payment for the 31st year Allied Victory American Gold Bonds reserve funds have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and transferred to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, and will be paid out as scheduled.

### Hua Shares Trading Listless

The news of loan-seeking yesterday for the 52nd forward delivery of Hua Shares affected market sentiment, with retail investors mostly considering selling their current holdings. Due to few new buyers for the forward delivery, a state of weakness was evident at times. Interest rates gradually declined. Although Guangbang banks were absorbing spot holdings, they were ultimately unable to reverse the downward trend, and the forward market closed at a low price, making the market quite clear. However, arbitrage trading was still considerable. In the afternoon, due to the bottom support, which had been squeezed out in the morning, the current delivery was connected, and also came to an end in the forward market, slightly invigorating market sentiment, and prices mostly recovered. Mid-way, news came out that the government was short by 100 billion yuan, further stimulating buying. Moreover, it was learned that the National Economic Commission would convene a meeting in the capital, which generally raised hopes. Therefore, prices closed high at the end, with fluctuations being rare and the foundation remaining stable.

### Brokers Request Discretionary Reduction of Margin

[Our Report] The city's stock exchange held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4 pm yesterday. After discussing the case of the Brokers Association's request to reduce the margin for forward delivery, it was generally believed that the brokers' statements were true, and it was decided to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review.

### Rice Market Sales Sluggish, Oil Prices Fluctuated

Yesterday, the north and south markets together received over 12,500 piculs of rice. The early market was tight for a time, but ended up softening due to sluggish sales. In the end, japonica and indica rice were both high-priced but sluggish, while white yuan and yin yuan were flat. Flour prices fell sharply in the early market. In the afternoon, due to high prices in Wuxi, they recovered by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bean cake prices were stable.

Both supply and demand for soybean cake were scarce. Soybean prices fell in the early market, but then recovered because local merchants were purchasing and oil factories were inquiring, resulting in a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. For Nanyang, bean traders still preferred high-quality materials. Guangbang merchants were actively searching for red beans. Although the arrival of new red beans was strong, prices still rose by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Cowpeas saw a decline in Shantou sales, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sorghum distilleries were busy with sales, pushing prices up by 10,000 yuan. Maize saw slight movement from northern merchants, raising prices slightly. Sesame saw brisk sales locally, recovering by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Oil factories also entered the market, causing the market to become firm. Raw peanuts were firm both officially and unofficially.

Oil market prices fluctuated. Soybean oil sales were brisk, recovering by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Raw oil was sluggish. Raw oil from Jiangbei arrived in Shanghai, falling by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Clear oil, sesame oil, and rapeseed oil saw little activity.

More Than 30 Cases of Applications for Returning Goods Imported with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

Since the issuance of the notice last week by the Import Control Committee regarding the application for and supplementary registration of goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, importers have already started going through the procedures. As of now, there have been over 30 applications for returning goods for export. Most importers are still waiting for the government's announcement of the purchase and sale methods. Therefore, applicants for purchase are still waiting to see. In addition, the Import Control Committee has not yet notified customs to release merchants applying for returning the original goods. The committee is currently compiling the received applications for return and will notify customs for release upon completion.

### No Such Decision by the Import Control Committee for Relaxation of Quotas in South China

Also, according to a news report that quotas for imports to South China are about to be relaxed and that imports with self-provided foreign exchange may be allowed, Chief Secretary Fang Yunxian of the Secretariat of the Import Control Committee stated that he had heard nothing of this. The committee currently has no such decision, and there have been no reports from South China either. He believes it is the opinion and hope of the general public. Furthermore, Director Shen Zouting of the Quota Allocation Division stated that the relaxation of quotas for South China and the permission of imports with self-provided foreign exchange should be uniformly stipulated by the committee. If the quotas for South China should be relaxed, the number should be increased from within the seasonal quota. President Zhang previously doubled the quotas for South China during his trip to Hui, and the committee has not yet made a decision on how it should be in the future. As for self-provided foreign exchange, it is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. Shen's expression regarding the relaxation of quotas for the fourth quarter is based on the transfer of foreign exchange income. If foreign exchange increases, relaxing quotas will not be a problem. Currently, all industries are requesting increases.

### Commercial Briefs

Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus of the clearing house had a difference of 17.6 billion yuan. Unofficial interest was 20%, and the securities discount rate remained at 19.5% to 24%.

The overall rationing of edible oil, originally scheduled to begin on the first of next month, is a joint allocation by the China Trust Bureau, China Plants, and the Three Refining Oil Industry Association, totaling 36,000 dan. It will be sold at the allocated price to the Shanghai Municipal Food Distribution Committee for distribution. Due to the outstanding funding issues during the delivery, distribution is difficult to carry out as scheduled.

### Women, Infants, and Tetanus

— Yang Yuanji

The relationship between women and infants and diseases is more closely related than that of the average person, and tetanus is no exception. Therefore, the saying "Only women and petty men are difficult to raise" can also be interpreted in this way. What exactly is tetanus? To understand the terrible nature of tetanus, one must first understand its extraordinary personality and vitality.

It is a rod-shaped bacterium about 2-3 microns long with dozens of flagella that enable it to move. It can live in any environment as long as it is devoid of oxygen. It thrives best at a temperature of around 35 degrees Celsius.

Moreover, it has strong resistance. Simple steaming for less than five minutes or high heat above 80 degrees for less than an hour is not enough to kill it. It can withstand adverse conditions in carbolic acid for fifteen minutes and struggle for three hours in a 1% mercuric chloride solution. It can even withstand direct sunlight for a considerable period.

Therefore, it is very tall, wouldn't you agree? It can survive in the soil for three and a half years and can be passed down for sixteen months in the concentrate of a horse's body. When transplanted onto dry wood chips, their history can extend for years.

The element that creates this tenacious personality is its innate toxicity. This severe toxicity is what makes it extraordinary and makes it a great enemy of mankind. It uses this externally produced weapon to attack in two ways: one binds to nerve center cells, causing spasms (called tetanus toxin Tetanospasmin); and the other dissolves red blood cells, causing poisoning (called tetanus hemolysin Tetanolysin). Therefore, its toxins occupy the highest position among bacterial toxins: only 0.00002 grams of toxin can kill a white mouse weighing 10 cm. Animals, especially horses, are most susceptible to it, almost as if they have encountered a fierce god.

However, if human tissues are healthy and without wounds, then tetanus bacteria smeared on the skin cannot exert their power and have no opportunity to release toxins.

Therefore, for it to interact with humans, the following conditions must be met:

1. There is a wound on the skin or mucous membrane.

2. In addition to tetanus bacteria, foreign objects (such as wood chips) or other bacteria are mixed into the wound.

3. The environment of the wound site should be dirty, poorly ventilated, and frequently visited by humans and animals.

There are two views regarding its entry path:

1. One view is that it invades through the lymphatic system. It progresses centripetally from the peripheral lymphatic spaces around local nerves to the motor nerve center cells, where they combine.

2. Another view is that the toxin travels from the blood vessel-lymphatic system at the point of entry to the nerve endings and then along the axons to the center, where it combines with the motor nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.

Now let's describe the terrible face that tetanus presents to humanity:

Have you ever seen a hideous expression that is neither a sneer nor a bitter smile? This is the unique tetanus facies (Facies Tetanica). Its unique smile is called sardonic grin (Risus Sardonicus). Let me analyze it in detail, and it will not be difficult for you to imagine: The occurrence of this expression begins with rigidity of the masticatory muscles—the chewing movement is hindered, and the jaw is clenched shut (Trismus), making it impossible to eat. Secondly, the facial muscles tense up, causing wrinkles on the forehead, the mouth to slant outwards, the teeth to be exposed, and the labial folds to be indented (Nasolabialfalte). Thirdly, the neck muscles become rigid, the back muscles tense, and the abdominal muscles tense, forming opisthotonos and a board-like abdomen. When the intercostal muscles also tense, the chest cavity is fixed in an inspiratory state, and all respiratory movement relies solely on the diaphragm.

The most painful thing is that the patient has not lost consciousness and is very clear-headed. Because of the hyperactivity of reflexes, even the slightest stimuli, such as a small amount of light or sound, can trigger recurrent spasms, not to mention coughing or swallowing. The patient cries out in pain, with tears in their eyes, in a state of misery that is unbearable to witness. Near death, the temperature can exceed 43 degrees Celsius, so-called hyperpyrexia, probably due to paralysis of the regulating center.

Patients may die lightning-fast in three or four days, or paralytically in one or two weeks. Those who can survive for five or six weeks are more likely to recover. The shorter the incubation period, the worse the outcome.

From this, it is obvious that tetanus bacteria easily come into contact with women and infants. Because:

1. When a baby is born, the umbilical cord must be cut, which inevitably creates a wound. If the instrument used to cut the umbilical cord is unclean or the binding tape is dirty and not disinfected, then lockjaw can occur, known as the "seven-day wind." That is, what is medically called neonatal tetanus (Tetanus Traumaticiano).

2. During childbirth, the genital area of the mother will be injured to a greater or lesser extent. Strict disinfection during delivery and clean treatment during the puerperium are essential to avoid bacterial infection. Otherwise, the disaster of uncleanness can cause infinite harm. Those who take advantage of the opportunity to enter are not only tetanus bacteria.

Therefore, in order to prevent bacterial infection and to prevent tetanus from easily depriving life, absolute disinfection of the parturient woman and absolute attention to disinfection of the umbilical cord are iron rules that cannot be neglected. Violating the rules undoubtedly indirectly leads to the great mistake of negligent homicide.

Although there is also serum therapy for tetanus, it is not as miraculous and rapid as diphtheria serum because tetanus toxin binds to nerve bacteria more quickly and firmly than diphtheria toxin binds to tissue cells. Furthermore, treatment with serum injection is mostly ineffective after spasms have occurred. The earlier the injection, the better. The dosage for subcutaneous and intravenous use should be large, with antitoxin reaching 40,000 to 50,000 units. The dosage for intrathecal injection into the spinal cord can be small, about 200 to 300 units, and can be very effective. Of course, wound cleaning, disinfection, astringency, and magnesium sulfate (20%) injection are all symptomatic treatments in the treatment and are essential effective measures.

Although the results of tetanus serum are not as significant as those of diphtheria, it has been able to reduce the mortality rate from 80-90% to 40-50%, which is not considered a poor effect.

If we review the records of ancient medicine, there is also much evidence for reference:

For example, in "General Treatise on the Etiology and Symptomatology of Various Diseases" by Chao Yuanfang of the Sui Dynasty, there are six types of "postpartum stroke and spasm": "The symptoms are mouth stiffness, opisthotonos, shaking head, horse neighing, waist bent backward, occurring ten times in an instant, shortness of breath as if dying, sweating like rain, those who are not wiped in time will die."

And as he describes infantile lockjaw, he says:

"One day of lockjaw, two days of trismus, three days of wind-induced death, are all urgent illnesses; but look at the red face, shortness of breath, and inability to cry, the prognosis is already critical and dangerous."

Then it can be known that tetanus, as a disease, was regarded as a hopeless and severe terminal illness as early as thousands of years ago.

### Nutritional Disorders in Breastfed Infants (Continued)

— Cheng Hanzhang

Nutritional Therapy for Indigestion

The necessity of nutritional therapy can be understood by observing that changing the diet alone can achieve therapeutic effects.

Human Milk Nutritional Therapy: Generally, the younger the breastfed infant, the more necessary human milk nutrition becomes. However, even for older breastfed children, human milk is the most superior nutritional therapy. When administering human milk, there is no need to specify the exact quantity; it is sufficient to limit the duration and frequency of breastfeeding.

After starting human milk nutrition, there is no immediate increase in body weight; instead, there is a decrease in body weight for the first two to four days. Then, the symptoms ease, the appearance improves, and body weight increases.

Artificial Nutritional Therapy: Begin with starvation therapy for the first six to twenty-four hours.

Starvation Therapy

Not necessarily absolute starvation; harmless substances like a small amount of dextrose crystals (approximately 0.05%) in roasted tea decoction can be added, given in amounts of 20 to 30 cubic centimeters per day, every two hours. As a result of this method, the infant becomes calm, sleeps well, and the frequency of diarrhea decreases. However, this therapy is very dangerous for those who are severely depleted or only two or three weeks old, as it can lead to a decline in endurance that is difficult to recover. Therefore, it is advisable not to use it.

From the second day of therapy, administer skim milk or unsweetened buttermilk, or milk supplemented with oatmeal juice (use fortified milk for growing infants). The quantity should not exceed 200 cubic centimeters for the entire day on the second day, with a maximum of 40 cubic centimeters per feeding, five times a day. Additionally, use sweetened roasted tea to meet fluid requirements. Afterward, adjust the dosage based on the overall condition and stool characteristics, gradually increasing the amount as a guideline. For example: On the second day of therapy, fortified milk is given at a rate of cubic centimeters per feeding.

Five times a day. On the third day of therapy, fortified milk is given at a rate of 50 cubic centimeters per feeding. On the fourth day of therapy, fortified milk is given at a rate of 60 cubic centimeters per feeding.

The dosage can be gradually increased in this way, transitioning to a diet concentration and quantity appropriate for the age. Also, when first using skim milk, one can gradually transition to whole milk, considering the symptoms. For example, initially use a milk mixture with equal parts whole milk and skim milk to reduce fat, then halve the skim milk content.

The increase in body weight is based on carbohydrates, so attention must be paid when adding them to the milk. (The End)

### An Incident of Unexpected Complications Arising from Neck Surgery Using Anesthesia

— Liang Junqing

Two cases of death due to anesthesia have occurred this year in Beijing and Shanghai. Among them, the case of Dr. Guo Zhide of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital, who performed a local anesthesia to remove a wart on the buttocks of Ke Weiyao, has been acquitted by the court. However, the case of Dr. Qian Mingxi of Nanjing Municipal Hospital, who used spinal anesthesia for Diao Rongtai to treat appendicitis, was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to one and a half years in prison. The Qian case is very similar to the Guo case. From a scientific point of view, the Qian case should have been acquitted. However, in this chaotic world, Chinese scientists are worthless, let alone discarded teachers who ponder issues. One can only rely on one's fate. The Qian case has been appealed, and I do not know the outcome. Recently, I read about an incident involving the use of anesthesia with unexpected complications in the Swiss Medical Gazette, Volume 77, Issue 33, published on August 16th of this year, which is very similar to the Qian case. If the judge adopts the materials presented and reverses the verdict, it would be fortunate not only for Dr. Qian Mingxi, but also for the entire Western medical community in our country.

(Note: This incident occurred around August 1946. The attending physician was Dr. L. Ruedi, Director of the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department and University Professor at the University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. The patient suffered from pharyngeal cellulitis. After intravenous injection of the general anesthetic (Narconumal), respiratory arrest occurred immediately. Although various emergency measures were taken to revive the patient and the original condition was treated surgically, the patient remained unconscious and died the next day. An immediate autopsy was performed to determine the cause of death. The course of events was described by Dr. K. Graf. He detailed the advantages and disadvantages of using general or local anesthesia for surgery on the neck or throat, as well as the opinions of various surgical experts from different countries on this type of anesthesia for the aforementioned conditions (some opposed, others favored). Dr. Graf also detailed the various advantages of intravenously injected general anesthetics such as Narconumal, as well as the rare occurrence of side effects. Due to the length of the article, it is not included here. Only excerpts of the surgical procedure, the autopsy findings, and the inspection results are reported.)

The patient was a 27-year-old businessman. Four days prior, he suddenly felt pain and difficulty swallowing food on both sides of his throat. He then noticed severe pain near the thyroid gland on the left side, which worsened when swallowing. Three days later, his temperature fluctuated between 38 and 39 degrees Celsius. The doctor suspected a retro-pharyngeal abscess and advised him to stay in the hospital for consultation. His examination report on August 7, 1946, was as follows: "The patient is severely ill, frequently complaining of intense pain when swallowing. Temperature is 38.4 degrees. The neck is swollen. The left side of the neck is particularly red and swollen. Pressing on the left side of the neck causes severe pain. There appears to be a hard and distinct swelling, which is easily distinguishable. The mass formed by the thyroid gland is very painful to the touch. The jugular veins on both sides of the neck are also painful and swollen, but there is no pitting when pressed. The right side of the neck also exhibits similar symptoms, but not as severe. At this time, the patient's jaws are not stiff. The tongue is normal. The tonsils are of medium size and show no signs of inflammation. The back of the throat is normal, but the bands on both sides of the throat are slightly swollen. The trachea is normal. The clinical diagnosis is difficult to determine between thyroiditis, septic tonsillitis, and retro-pharyngeal cellulitis. The treatment method is Elcosin 6gm, Penicillin, and 500 cc of physiological saline injection.

On August 8th, the condition remained the same. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 37 to 66. White blood cell count was 9,600. White blood cell classification showed septic left shift. Temperature was 39.6 degrees. Fearing the entry of toxins into the jugular vein causing thrombosis, Professor Ruedi performed ligation of the jugular vein under local anesthesia. The surgery confirmed the presence of thrombus. However, ligation of the jugular vein not only did not alleviate the condition but also seemed to lead to further spread of the infection. At this time, the temperature fluctuated between 38 and 39 degrees. On August 10th of the same year, the examination was repeated, and the symptoms remained the same, but the head was more swollen, from the soft palate to the trachea. The back of the throat and the bands on both sides were also swollen, feeling like cotton. Although the trachea remained normal, both sides were swollen and narrowed. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Before the Exhibition of Professor Huang Junbi’s Paintings

— Zhang Daofan

In the winter of the twenty-fourth year [of the Republic], I was introduced by Brother Liang Hancao and got to know the painter Huang Junbi in Nanjing. We had a very pleasant conversation about art, and it has been more than ten years since then. I know that Mr. Junbi is deeply devoted to art. He received kind instruction from his mother since childhood and worked hard at painting. When he grew up, he studied under Mr. Li Yaoping, excelling with his natural talent and surpassing his teacher. In his prime, he took promoting art as his mission and founded the Chinese Painting Research Association in Guangzhou. Mr. Junbi contributed greatly to the flourishing of the Lingnan painting style. Before the war, he served as a painting instructor at vocational schools. He once traveled to the East to study art on government orders, broadening his knowledge. His paintings are exquisite in all subjects, including figures and flowers and birds, especially landscapes, drawing from numerous masters and creating his unique style. The ancient pines are strong, the waterfalls are rapid, the clouds and smoke appear and disappear, and the artistic expression is vivid. Connoisseurs call them the three wonders of the Huang school of landscape painting. Mr. Junbi has dedicated decades to painting. His collection is very rich, and his skills are profound. He not only deeply studies the ancient masters, but also learns from nature and creates new ideas. He has visited almost all the famous mountains and rivers in China, including the Five Mountains, Mount Huang, Yan Rock, Mount Emei, Jianmen, Qingcheng, and the Three Gorges. Therefore, his works can use the brush and ink of his predecessors to depict the themes of nature, and his achievements are due to this. Mr. Junbi taught at the Art Department of Central University during the war in Sichuan, and students followed him enthusiastically. He wrote "One Hundred Views of the Jialing River," which was comparable to the works of his predecessors, and the art world praised it. Collectors both inside and outside the country treasure his paintings more than precious jade. His unique style has long been famous in the world, and there is no need for further explanation. Now, in his spare time from teaching, he has created a collection of works and has been invited by friends in Shanghai to exhibit them at the Chinese Painting Garden on Chengdu Road from October 31st to November 5th. Viewers who see so many of his carefully crafted works can verify that my words are not false and are not merely flattering him!

### Night Walk

— Qinling

The waning crescent moon faintly illuminates the alley, and the wind lightly and quickly slips along the riverbank, one gust following another. The clusters of green plants growing on the short walls of houses by the water are hazy and pale green. The casually hanging branches are rubbed against the wall by the wind, making rustling sounds.

The sound of footsteps drags out shadows. I walk alone by the river at night, feeling a sense of warmth and loneliness. I am too familiar with this place. From childhood to adulthood, every day, in sunshine, in wind and snow, I carried my schoolbag and passed by here, without interruption, without stopping. I can name the owner of each wall, what kind of ripe fruit is in the garden behind each wall, and I clearly remember the location of the small trees by the river. The river sings its poems affectionately all day long, and the light wind whistles. Years have passed, leaving traces on me, and I pass them on to the alley.

For the sake of life, I have been away from my hometown for many years. Tonight, I revisit the old place, and every wall and every tree has changed its face. The original walls have collapsed, and new walls have been built. The owners have also changed. The sparse small trees have grown into dense and vigorous forms. The ancient trees that have shed their leaves sigh in the night wind like aging old people. Everything has changed, but every pebble and every green leaf here still has a sense of intimacy to me. We have lived together! For years, leaving the alley, leaving home, I ventured into a strange and distant environment, experiencing loneliness and hardship. But returning to the alley today, I am afraid that I, like the alley, can only say "You have become haggard!"

Passing through the alley is the avenue of the Confucius Temple. There are no pedestrians on the road. The red walls of the school palace glow dimly in the moonlight. From the tall ancient trees comes the sound of birds chirping. The stone railings along the river cast oblique shadows. The arch bridge sleeps quietly above the flowing water. The archways above, with the characters I used to count carefully, stand tall in the darkness. There is a heavy sense of loneliness here, but it has become an excellent harmony for my recently troubled mood.

Beyond that, a vast field of grass unfolds. Corn and sunflowers are densely crowded together. Autumn insects and the sound of gnawing echo up and down. The wind rolls over the leaves, from this end of the grass field to the other. This scene makes me miss many of my childhood playmates. At that time, we all caught grasshoppers, picked fresh corn, pulled down corn husks to make whistles, caught fireflies among the ferns, took off our shoes and ran down to the washing stones, soaking our feet in the water... But those childhood friends, now some have died, and the living are separated and out of contact with each other. Based on some news that has been passed on, I only know whose situation is worse. In this day and age, emotions, hopes, and colorful dreams have all been crushed to pieces. In order to live, in order to put on a smiling face, we struggle with fatigue and hardship. The past is a dream, beautiful and wild, exquisite and lively, but everything is irretrievable.

In the distance, the sound of night watchmen's clappers come in waves. The time is approaching midnight. There is light thunder in the sky. The slightly rough wind dilutes the moonlight. Suddenly, my pace slows down, and I feel endless fatigue and sadness. It seems that someone is whispering in my ear:

"Now, just living is a luxury."

### Grapes

— Xiyuan

——A Note from Listening to the Autumn Pavilion

As time passes, autumn is coming to an end. Melons are already a thing of the past, and various fresh fruits are coming into season.

Among all the fresh fruits, I find grapes more lovable than others. Mengyang's grape poem says: "When the west wind passes over the wild geese for thousands of miles, the shadows of green clouds and dark jade are uneven. Try to chew a mouthful of ice balls, and don't say that there are lychees in the south of the sky." In fact, it doesn't have to be after drinking. At any time, pick up a bunch of grapes and send them into your mouth one by one. The sweet and delicious taste makes people feel happy.

If we explore the origin of grapes, it is the same as watermelons. They were imported from the Western Regions. The History of the Han Dynasty: The Biography of the Kingdom of Dayuan records: "Dayuan uses grapes to make wine, and the rich store wine up to tens of thousands of stones. Those who have been around for decades will not fail. The Han envoy collected grapes and alfalfa and brought them back to plant. The emperor used many heavenly horses, and foreign envoys came in crowds, so he planted grapes beside the palaces, which was very prosperous." Li Qi's poem says: "The bones of war are buried in the wilderness year after year, and grapes are only seen entering the Han family." But now people only know how to enjoy it, who knows the origin of this mere grape!

There are many kinds of grapes, and Fang Zhi recorded them in detail; Crystal grapes, the color is white like powder, the shape is large and long, and the taste is very sweet, especially the Western ones. As for milk grapes, the color is purple, the shape is large and long, and the taste is sweet. Purple grapes, black, there are two kinds of large and small, sweet and sour. Green grapes, from Sichuan, are green when ripe, like Western grapes, named Shining Eyes, which tastes better than sugar and honey, and seedless, which is Wu Pin."

What is related to grapes is wine. Su Zi's poem says: "Grapes can't stand the winter, and they curl up as if they have no breath. In spring, they take advantage of the prosperous sun, and the shelves are covered with green silk quilts. Dragons are messy and countless, and the nipples hang to the ground. At first, they are like early plums, and later they taste like thick cheese. Who can make wine for you? I'll get drunk in front of the shelf for you." Liu Yuxi's poem says: "It becomes a beautiful wine, which makes people not enough to drink. I will hold a bucket for you and go to Liangzhou to collect it." Wang Han's Liangzhou song: is even more well-known.

There are many texts in our country that praise grapes. In Emperor Wei Wen's edict, there is a passage about grapes. He said: "There are many precious fruits in China, let's talk about grapes, when they are in late summer and early autumn, there is still a surplus of heat, drunken and sober from wine, after the dew and eat, sweet but not sweet, crispy but not sour, cold but not cold, long taste and juicy, eliminate troubles and quench thirst, and they can be used as wine, sweeter than rice cakes, It is already drooling, let alone eating it in person? Other fruits, can there be a match?" This shows Cao Pi's special appreciation for grapes, but he can be called a confidant of grapes.

"What kind of news, Mr. Wu?" Qiang spoke before me; as she spoke, she directed Little Tiger to pour tea for Yuanyuan.

"Isn't it just about the Japanese devils attacking Nankou!" Yuanyuan gathered the clothes and parts he had taken off into a pile, threw them on the grass pile in the corner of the room: "They originally planned to attack at dawn tomorrow; I don't know how it came about, but now I hear that it has been changed to a midnight sneak attack - it will start at twelve o'clock tonight. With this change, there is nothing else, but..."

"But!..." Yaoqun said these two words at the same time, and then stopped immediately, meaning to let Dingyuan continue. But Dingyuan, seeing that Yaoqun had taken over, slowly walked towards the grass pile in the corner, propped his hand on the grass pile, and sat down rustlingly, took the cup of tea that Little Tiger had poured for him, and apologized to Yuanyuan, meaning to let Yaoqun express her opinion. Dingyuan's English gentlemanly attitude probably only retained some of these.

"But... it seems to be in conflict with our planned plan, isn't it?" Yaoqun looked at Dingyuan and said the sentence she wanted to say.

"Isn't it? I was thinking the same thing." Dingyuan expressed the opinion he was just about to express.

We people listened to the dialogue between Yaoqun and Dingyuan, and they didn't seem to understand the meaning; the big fool "04" only opened his big eyes, showing his brilliance and mystery; Little Tiger also stared wide-eyed. She looked at Yuanyuan and Dingyuan. As for me, of course, I was even more confused.

"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Yue!" Yaoqun smiled apologetically at me: "Just now, because I mentioned the past, I rambled on and on, and forgot to tell you the important things to do tonight. We came here to plan to leave Changping together tonight, or at the latest tomorrow morning. Before we leave, we plan to give the Japanese spy headquarters here a fierce blow, at least to smash it to pieces..."

"Oh?" I was a little surprised to hear Yaoqun's plan.

"Yes," Yaoqun nodded very decisively to me: "Our steps are like this; first I and Brother Tiger run to the front line of the devils, the left wing, and send out a signal. The National Army guarding Nankou has already communicated with us in advance, and as soon as they get this signal, they will start the night attack; the entire front line will be launched together. Although they don't necessarily have to rush into the line of the Japanese devils, they are also prepared to give the devils a major blow!..."

"Signal?..." "Night attack?..." I didn't mean to interrupt Yaoqun's words, just repeating the words of the few people on Yaoqun's lips.

### That Sincere Maid

— Baudelaire, Translated by Dai Wangshu

That sincere maid, whom you envied in those years, now she sleeps beneath the humble grass, we should also bring a few flowers to offer. The dead, the poor dead, all have great suffering; when October, the tree feller, blows its mournful wind, whirling around their tombstones, they must feel that the living are truly heartless, sleeping so peacefully, warmly embracing the cotton quilt, while they are tormented by dark dreams, with no one to share their pillow, nor to make jokes, old bones freezing, gnawed by insects to the marrow, they feel the winter snow seeping dry, feel the centuries passing, and no friend or home to replace the withered flowers hanging on their grates. If, when the hearth sings its songs, I see her sitting in the armchair, at ease, if, in the blue cold night of December, I find her curled up in a corner of the room, her expression solemn, coming from her eternal bed, watching with loving eyes the children she raised; seeing her sunken eyes overflowing with tears, how shall I answer this devout soul?

### The Rebirth of National Art

— Pan Gongzhan

— Reading Professor Huang Junbi's Chinese Paintings

The achievement of a generation of literary and artistic scholarship is the accumulation of thousands of years of historical culture. Only with a profound and long-standing cultural origin can there be a radiant and outstanding generation of art. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "The sincere is incessant, incessant therefore enduring, enduring therefore subtle, subtle therefore far-reaching, far-reaching therefore broad and deep, broad and deep therefore brilliant and luminous." This statement accurately explains the continuous and brilliant phenomenon of our national culture. Sincerity is the supreme treasure of our national spirit and a basic condition for those engaged in general literary and artistic scholarship. Its achievements cannot be separated from national origins and cultural traditions, which is even more difficult to deny.

Professor Huang Junbi of Central University inherited his family learning since childhood, studied under famous teachers, viewed famous paintings, and worked tirelessly; he studied the great masters of the Song Dynasty, the Four Masters of the Yuan Dynasty, Shen Zhou, Wen Zhengming, Tang Yin, Qiu Ying of the Ming Dynasty, the Two Shi of the Qing Dynasty, and Xin Luo, extensively. Before the war, he traveled east to study art. After returning to China, he roamed the famous scenic spots in China, such as Luofu, Yangshuo, Huangshan, and Yandang, and lingered to sketch on each trip. During the war, he went up the Yangtze River to the west, climbed Mount Emei three times, and exited Jianmen twice. His "One Hundred Views of the Jialing River" not only directly approached his predecessors but also created a unique style.

I once heard Mr. Junbi discuss painting, advocating that beginners must distinguish the sources of various schools before tracing back to the Tang and Song dynasties; after achieving academic success, they should learn from nature and create their own styles. The so-called "drawing inspiration from the ancients and using nature as a teacher" is close to this.

Mr. Junbi has been teaching at Central University for nearly ten years. Students follow him enthusiastically, and the art world respects him. Recently, he brought his works to Shanghai for exhibition. I had the honor to view his works "Emerald Mountains", "Sail Shadows at Jianmen", "Guanyin at Yan Rock", "Summer Retreat in the Bamboo Forest", "Flying Waterfall at Gaokang Rock", and "Seeking Appreciation with Qin". The brushwork is vigorous, the coloring is profound, the composition is novel and elegant, mostly between the Song and Yuan people; and the clouds, smoke, water, light, lush and flowing, every grass and tree are full of life, and he can deeply grasp the essence of sketching. This is someone who is not only immersed in the national cultural tradition but also able to independently create with a sincere spirit.

After the crowd dispersed, I admired Mr. Junbi's skills and felt the rebirth of Chinese national art. I deeply believe that the source of rebirth cannot be separated from the inheritance of cultural traditions, and even more so relies on the development of a creative spirit. I will briefly express my feelings to seek advice from those who are wiser.

### The Central Bank's Issuing Bureau Replied: The 2,000 Yuan Note Printed by Waterlow & Sons, England, is Not a Counterfeit; the Front is Cyan and the Back is Light Red

This newspaper received a letter from reader Zhang Xiaozu of Xidun South Street: There is a type of legal tender, with a light red back and a cyan front, with a face value of 2,000 yuan, which does not have the seals of the President and Vice President of the Central Bank. Some shops accept it, while others refuse it, and the people are confused about its authenticity and want an answer. After inquiring with the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, we received the following reply:

We have received your letter and the attached letter from Zhang Xiaozu, which we have noted. The 2,000 yuan note you mentioned was printed by Waterlow & Sons in England. Because the back of the note already has the signature of the bank's president, the front does not have the official seals of the president and vice president of the bank. This type of note has been issued before. We are replying accordingly, hoping that you can explain this to the public. Sincerely, Shanghai Shen Bao Social Services Department, Central Bank Issuing Bureau.

### Reader's Mailbox: Divorce · Running Away · Pessimism

To Ms. Shan: We received your letter and sympathize greatly with your situation. Here are our brief responses to the three points you raised:

"Divorce": Legally, there are two ways to divorce: one is "consensual divorce," where both spouses agree to the divorce; however, minors must obtain the consent of their legal guardians. The procedure for divorce is also simple: write a divorce agreement with the signatures of two or more witnesses. Obtaining a lawyer's attestation is even more appropriate. If there are children, the father is legally responsible for their custody, unless otherwise agreed upon. You stated, "I am a woman of twenty years old." Legally, "adulthood" is reached at twenty years old. The age commonly referred to in customary usage is often the nominal age, so please be aware of this. The other type of divorce is "divorce by judgment," where one spouse petitions the court for divorce; however, legal grounds must exist, such as "one spouse being treated by the other in a way that makes cohabitation unbearable," or "one spouse maliciously abandoning the other in a continuous state," etc. (See Article 1052 of the Civil Code). A spouse who suffers damages due to divorce by judgment may seek compensation from the negligent spouse. According to your letter, it's only "lack of affection" and "looking down on him." There do not appear to be statutory grounds to rely upon, but the longer it goes on, the deeper the estrangement will become. We believe that affection can be cultivated between people, especially between spouses!

"Running Away": Running away is not an honorable solution. Before a divorce, marrying or cohabitating with someone else would violate the criminal law. (See Articles 237 and 239 of the Criminal Code).

"Pessimism": Suicide is the most cowardly and foolish act. Destroying yourself not only doesn't solve the problem but also fails to gain sympathy from society. What's the point? Therefore, thoughts of pessimism are absolutely unacceptable! What do you think? (Editor)
