### The National Assembly General Election Successfully Completed, Full List to Be Announced Within Ten Days; Chairman to Select Capital, Speaker Chen Yu-kuang

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The nationwide frenzy of general elections for National Assembly delegates reached its peak on the 23rd. Voting across various regions, lasting three days, was completed by the evening of the 23rd. The foundation for a democratic constitutional government, destined to last for ten thousand years, has been laid. Except for some pacification zones where elections will be conducted step by step according to supplementary election regulations, the list of approximately 2,500 National Assembly delegates will be fully announced within ten days.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang arrived at the No. 8 polling station in the first district of Nanjing City at 8:09 a.m. on the 23rd. As a citizen, he voted for Chen Yu-kuang as a National Assembly delegate. (Note: Chen is the Speaker of the Nanjing Municipal Council and the current President of Jinling University.) The Chairman, dressed in casual yellow attire and a black felt hat, entered the gate of Daxinggong Elementary School polling station. He immediately went to the verification desk and then sat down at the ballot issuing desk, completing the ballot quickly. The Mayor of Nanjing, Shen Yi, told the Chairman, "You need to cast it yourself." The Chairman then went to the ballot box and personally dropped it in gently. At that time, Chinese and foreign photographers captured the precious moment. When the Chairman entered the Daxinggong Elementary School polling station, twenty Boy Scouts from the school stood at attention and saluted, shouting slogans such as "Welcome Chairman Chiang to implement constitutionalism" and "Long live Chairman Chiang." The Chairman smiled, nodded, and said, "Good, good." He completed his voting procedure in two minutes and then left.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Heads of various ministries and commissions of the National Government went to various polling stations on the 23rd to vote for National Assembly delegates. Around 10:00 a.m., Vice Chairman Sun Ke, Premier Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan Yu Youren, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Gan Naiguang, and others went to the No. 3 polling station at Langya Road Central Elementary School to vote.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] When Premier Zhang Qun went to Langya Elementary School to vote for National Assembly delegates on the 23rd, onlookers crowded around. Zhang objected to this and explained kindly that voting should be conducted in secret and that others should not peep at how one fills out their ballot. The onlookers retreated accordingly. Zhang then wrote swiftly and personally put his ballot into the ballot box.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Premier Zhang Qun spoke to reporters after voting, saying that he was very pleased with the smooth process of the election. Wu Tiecheng told reporters after voting that this election was an unprecedented event in the history of the Republic of China, and that voting was the first lesson in democratic politics, which has now been completed.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Chen Lifu, Minister of the Central Organization Department, stated: "China's unprecedented election is not as satisfactory as expected." The general lack of enthusiasm among voters is the most disappointing factor in the election. The limited interest is due to the instability of the Chinese situation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Assembly delegate election has ended. Zeng Qi, Chairman of the China Youth Party, issued his views on the election to foreign reporters on the 23rd, saying: Although the results of the national general election will not be clear until a few days later, the general situation is much better than it was 35 years ago, because the general public is gradually becoming interested in elections, and women's voting is something that did not exist in the first year of the Republic of China. Zeng said: This morning, he personally went to the polling station and voted for She Chongfa, a China Youth Party member candidate in Nanjing, while his wife, Madam Juo Ruonan, voted for Chen Yu-kuang, a socially respected figure. Zeng said: As a couple, each exercising their sacred right to vote freely, he believes that they are no less worthy than the advanced countries in Europe and America. A foreign reporter asked: Now that the National Assembly election has come to an end, how will the number of seats for the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic League be negotiated? Zeng said: "The three parties are in the process of negotiating, and our party's list will be submitted in the near future."

The most interesting thing is that Hu Wenzhen, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, was mistakenly written as Hu Wenhu by the voters on as many as a thousand ballots.

### The National Army in Yulin Pursues and Suppresses the Forces; the Defense of Yimeng is Strengthened; Deng Baoshan Has Entered Yulin City

[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 23rd] Chen Yujia, the garrison commander of Yimeng, returned to Guihua from Baotou on the evening of the 22nd to report to the chairman of the party. It is reported that Commander-in-Chief Deng Baoshan has entered Yulin City, the communist bandits who attacked Yulin have been defeated, and the National Army is pursuing them on all fronts. The initial attempt of the communist bandits to invade Yulin was to besiege Yulin with a part of their forces and to flee north to Yimeng with a part of their forces to disrupt the two banners of the Zasak County King. However, because Commander-in-Chief Deng led his troops from Baotou to support and stationed in the Zha Banner, and the security teams of the banners of Yimeng also gathered to defend strictly, the communist bandits' conspiracy was not successful, and Yimeng has always been peaceful. Now that the siege of Yulin has been lifted and the communist bandits have retreated, the winter defense of Yimeng is even more solid. However, the disaster situation in Yimeng this year is severe, and a large amount of relief is still needed. Dongsheng moved its government in the autumn of this year. After a month of rain, more than 300 of the 500 houses in the city collapsed. So far, the broken walls have not been completely repaired. During the heavy rain, the city walls of Dongsheng also collapsed, and they have now been repaired.

Less than one-fifth of the timber has been transported, but more than two million catties have already been obtained. Among them, the door panels were transported from Yangcheng, Jishan, and Quwo. The number of sacks is countless, which shows the depth of the bandits' plan to occupy Yuncheng.

### The CCP Radio Station and Espionage Organization in Beiping Were Cracked; Spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense Selectively Announces

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] According to the spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense, the Beiping Xingyuan cracked a secret CCP radio station and espionage organization in September this year. This case involves Yu Xinqing, a design committee member of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, and Li Gongyi, a student of Peking University. At that time, some people did not understand the truth and demanded the release of the arrested criminals. However, they did not know that the evidence of the crimes of these people was conclusive, and they had all confessed. Now, the process of cracking the case is selectively announced first in order to correct the public's perception. The initial investigation of this case was conducted by an intelligence officer sent by the Ministry to Beiping, who recruited a certain soldier participating in the CCP organization as an internal line. After more than a month of effort, it was finally confirmed. Therefore, the Beiping Xingyuan sent personnel to take action in the early morning of September 24th and cracked the secret CCP radio station at No. 24 Jingzhao East Street in Beiping. The motor and documents were seized on the spot, and its responsible person, Li Zhengxuan, telegraph operator Meng Liangwang, and code translator Zhang Houpei (Li's wife), and Li Yuping (Meng's wife) were arrested. After strict interrogation and detailed study of the seized documents, it was learned that this secret radio station and espionage organization belonged to the Central Intelligence Department system led by the CCP's Kang Sheng. It was also learned that the CCP's deployment of the intelligence network in Beiping began after the establishment of the Military Mediation Department. At that time, the CCP personnel used the Military Mediation Department as a cover. The person in charge was Li Kenong, Minister of the CCP Central Social Affairs Department, and the persons responsible for the actual operation were Feng Xuan and Xu Bing, secretaries of the CCP Military Mediation Department at that time. After the Military Mediation Department was dissolved and the CCP personnel withdrew, the CCP Central Intelligence Department decided to hand over all the previously deployed spy cells to Li Zhengxuan for management, command, and liaison. The funds for their work were 200 taels of gold left by Ye Jianying, which were used exclusively for black market trading to achieve self-sufficiency. Li Zhengguan stayed in Beiping and set up a secret radio station, and began reporting to the general station of the CCP Central Intelligence Department since March of this year. After Li Zhengxuan and others were arrested, a total of important CCP members were arrested one after another based on the clues provided and the documents obtained, including Yan Jianping (CCP number 311), chief of the first section of the Land Administration Bureau of the Beiping Municipal Government and acting director, Tian Zhongyan (CCP number 123), a teacher at Peiman Girls' Middle School in Beiping, Huang Zhaoyun (CCP number 128), a professor at Beiping Women's Normal University, Xie Shiyan (pseudonym Liu Fu), director of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, Yu Xinqing, a design committee member of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, Liang Ran (CCP number 133), a member of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, Ding Xing (CCP number 134), deputy director of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, Zhou Qixiang, secretary of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, Zhu Jianguo (CCP number 129), a staff officer of the Tianjin Command Post of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, Shi Chun, a staff officer of the Baoding Suiyuan General Headquarters, and Li Gongyi, a student of Peking University. Among them, Yan Jianping, Tian Zhongyan, and Dong Zhaoyun were all responsible for contacting a part of the espionage personnel, and their nature was equivalent to the leader of the espionage group. The rest, Xie Shiyan, Yu Xinqing, Liang Ran, Ding Xing, Ju Qixiang, Zhu Jianguo, Shi Chun, and Zhu Gongyi, were all CCP espionage workers, and the evidence was conclusive, and they all confessed. All the criminals in this case have been preliminarily interrogated, and the military law office of the Ministry will try them according to law. If there are any who do not fall within the scope of military law trial, they will be transferred to the court for processing.

### The Ministry of Economy Decided to Fully Implement the Unified Cotton Yarn Distribution Method; Chen Qitian Guan Bu Yuan Liang Succeeded as Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee

[Our City News] Chen Qitian, Minister of Economy, came to Shanghai from Beijing on the 22nd in view of the recent surge in yarn and cloth prices to discuss countermeasures with relevant parties.

At the meeting, he announced:

Zou Bingwen, chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, has not yet completed his mission in the United States and will be temporarily unable to return to China. He has requested to resign and has been approved. The vacancy has been filled by appointing Yuan Liang, the former mayor of Beiping.

The trial method of unified cotton yarn distribution has been reviewed and decided by President Zhang, Vice President Wang, President Zhang, Minister Zuo, and myself. This method is a necessary measure to stabilize the prices of cotton yarn and cloth at present, and the government has decided to handle it accordingly.

The task of the Textile Adjustment Committee is to regulate the supply and demand of cotton yarn and cloth, and to assess its reasonable price, and at the same time to promote the development of the textile industry.

In order to stabilize yarn prices, the government will cooperate with the Bank of China, the municipal government, and the Ministry of Economy to support the Textile Adjustment Committee in carrying out its tasks. At the same time, it is hoped that the national and private yarn factories will be able to support the committee with a spirit of sincere cooperation and promote the government's current policies.

Finally, President Zhang and Mayor Wu delivered speeches one after another, expressing that the Bank of China and the municipal government are willing to assist in the advancement of the unified distribution trial method with great strength, and hope that private factories will sacrifice their own interests and take care of the entire national policy, so as to avoid the government taking emergency measures.

### Far Eastern Economic Commission Meeting Opens Today in Baguio to Discuss Post-War Reconstruction of Asia, Chiang Ting-fu Hopes for Soviet Cooperation

[Central News Agency, Baguio, 23rd] The center of Far Eastern diplomacy will move from the 24th to the newly built building on the historic ruins of Baguio. Over the next two weeks, more than 200 representatives and experts from the eleven member countries and three sponsoring countries of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) will meet here to discuss the post-war reconstruction and economic development of this region, which is home to a quarter of the world's population and devastated by war. The second plenary session of ECAFE is scheduled to open at 3:00 PM on the 24th, and Philippine President Roxas will deliver an important speech. Among the delegations from various countries, the Netherlands has the largest number of representatives (14), followed by France (13), and then the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom (12 each). China has a total of seven representatives, while the newly established Pakistan has only one. The three sponsoring countries are Burma, Ceylon, and Hong Kong. Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations in charge of economic affairs, Woven, will participate in this session as the highest-ranking UN official present. It is reported that the two major components of reconstruction, food supply and transportation, will be the main topics of discussion at this session. The issue of Japanese reparations will also be discussed, and it is the only issue likely to cause strong disputes, as the question of "how to allocate industrial equipment to some Far Eastern countries that suffered serious losses during the war" is likely to lead to disagreements. The relationship between the ECAFE and occupied Japan and Korea will also be decided at this session. Although Japan and Korea are not currently participating in the ECAFE, the important question of the extent to which the post-war economies of Japan and Korea can contribute to the overall Asian economy still needs to be resolved. Some representatives attending the meeting and members of the ECAFE told reporters that, so far, this session has no political significance, and they also wish to avoid all political issues.

[Telegram] The second plenary session of the ECAFE has already encountered two thorny issues: one is the [blank] coup, which has raised questions about the attendance of its representatives, and the other is Indonesia's declaration that it will send representatives to the meeting regardless of Dutch opposition. News from here this afternoon said that the American diplomatic authorities stationed in Bangkok, representing the Philippines, have also refused to grant visas to the [blank] representatives to the Philippines, on the grounds that the United States has not yet recognized the new [blank] government. However, the Philippine government has expressed its hope that [blank] will attend the meeting and is taking appropriate steps to facilitate the arrival of the [blank] representatives in the Philippines. As for the issue of Indonesia's right to attend, it is not likely to be resolved at present, but the Dutch delegation already includes Indonesian representatives selected by the Netherlands.

[Our Dispatch] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Philippines dispatch, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East will be chaired by Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu. Chiang said today that hopes for a Marshall Plan for the Far East are not high. Whether this is possible is only known to Secretary of State Marshall. He believes that no representative to the ECAFE should propose this suggestion. Chiang hopes that the Soviet Union will adopt a cooperative attitude, and said that the ECAFE will never propose anything that harms Soviet interests. The results obtained after the meeting will be submitted to the Economic Council for approval.

Editorial

### The End of the General Election and Political Education

The nationwide general election of National Assembly representatives concluded yesterday. Judging from the capital, from Shanghai, and from the general situation in various provinces and cities, it can be generally described as a major step forward in China's political history of the last hundred years.

Of course, given the relatively low level of education of the Chinese people and the long-standing habit of "top-down" politics in China, this unprecedented general election is difficult to be completely satisfactory. The indifference of a large number of people to the election, the complications in receiving ballots, and the inability to ensure complete secrecy and freedom in the voting process may all be subject to criticism from observers in advanced democratic countries or people with democratic literacy. However, we should imagine: how can an infant just learning to walk compete with an athlete in a 100-meter race? How can a student just learning to swim compete with a strong swimmer who is accustomed to the water in crossing the Huangpu River? Then, in a China where most voters have not yet received sufficient political education, the initial general election can have a generally accurate effect. On balance, it should be a major event worthy of celebration by the whole country.

Therefore, in our opinion, the results of this general election, who are the elected National Assembly representatives in various places, and which party has the majority, are secondary. What is important is that the Chinese people, in the midst of the unrest caused by the Communist bandits, were still able to calmly receive a political education, showing that they are all willing to learn to "take the first step" on the road to democratic constitutionalism, which is worthy of attention from ourselves and well-intentioned international friends. The editorial in the "Ta Mei Evening News" a few days ago, while regretting the indifference of voters on the one hand, hoped that the government would give the people in various counties and cities more opportunities to elect local officials to manage local affairs in the future. The editorial in the "North China Daily News" also acknowledged that China's emergence as a democratic country, implementing a general election, represents a major political advancement for the country and is the most educationally meaningful measure in China since the Xinhai Revolution. Indeed, in this general election, our people truly did a "political tutelage" job themselves; and we hope that such self-political education or self-political training will undoubtedly be strengthened in the future.

We hope that in these elections with political educational significance, we will fully encourage ordinary voters to value their right to vote, fully ensure that they have the guarantee to exercise their right to vote completely freely, prescribe simple and feasible election methods as far as possible, and prevent all illegal coercion and activities. The general election of National Assembly representatives has ended, and there will soon be a general election of Legislative Yuan members. As long as the whole country has the sincerity to learn democracy, we believe that the order and effect at that time will be more advanced than this election of National Assembly representatives.

Finally, no matter who is elected, no matter which party is elected more, since they are produced by elections, they should all value their identity as "national representatives"; whether they are in power in the government or supervising in the opposition, they should all think about the country and the people at all times, so that China can truly be built into a new China of the Three Principles of the People, and no longer haggle over the private interests of a party, a faction, or a few individuals!

### Attention to the International Trade and Employment Conference

The International Trade and Employment Conference opened in Havana on the 21st of this month. More than 600 representatives from 40 countries around the world are discussing the charter of the International Trade Organization and will unanimously support all the resolutions passed by the International Trade Conference held in London, New York, Geneva, and other places over the past year. However, many obstacles are expected in the future. We believe that the success or failure of this international conference will have a significant impact on the future of world trade and must be closely watched.

Originally, exchanging labor and goods, and bartering to supply needs, is a mutually beneficial act; this is the case between individuals, and also between countries. However, due to the strength of national power, the abundance of resources, the superiority of production technology, the level of living standards, and various prejudices such as race, religion, and diplomacy, international trade, in addition to bartering to supply needs, is inevitably mixed with many other effects. As a result, the ideal of free trade, except for the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century, has not been put into practice.

The opposite of freedom is closure, blockade, interference, restriction, and control, which are measures that come and go and retaliate against each other. Thus, the originally mutually beneficial act turns into a mutually hostile act; and this economic hostility is very likely to rapidly degenerate into political and military hostility. Looking back at modern history, almost eight or nine out of ten international wars have this as the trigger. After reflection and change, it is no wonder that the call for free trade will rise again with the Second World War.

The so-called International Trade and Employment Conference is the crystallization of this kind of call. Its origin lies in the Atlantic Charter announced by Roosevelt and Churchill in 1941, which stipulated the principles of international economic cooperation, trade freedom, and equal access to raw materials; and it was facilitated by the recommendations on international trade drafted by the US State Department in 1945. This book was sent to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which decided to convene a preparatory meeting in London in October last year, which was the beginning of the formal action of the International Trade and Employment Conference.

The London Conference was the first preparatory meeting, attended by 18 countries including China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, while the Soviet Union and other countries refused to participate. After six weeks of meetings, although there were no concrete results, 80% of the draft proposed by the United States had been passed. It was also decided to hold the second preparatory meeting in Geneva on April 10 of this year.

During the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union and other countries still did not participate, and only 18 countries participated. After six months, 122 groups of multilateral tariff agreements were signed on October 30, including more than 45,000 items; its achievements were the greatest of all previous international economic conferences. President Truman praised it as a milestone in the history of international economic relations. The Economic and Social Council then decided to convene the formal meeting of the International Trade and Employment Conference on the 21st of this month, with its location in Havana, the capital of Cuba. Invitations were extended to more than 50 countries, and 32 countries accepted the invitation, which is more than the two preparatory meetings, but the Soviet Union and other countries still refused.

The task of this conference is naturally much more important than the preparatory meetings. Fortunately, the draft international trade charter has been passed in Geneva on September 10. Agreements have been reached on facilitating various international trades, increasing trade, increasing employment, and eliminating barriers to trade; and the main point of contention in international trade, namely tariff barriers, has been widely and separately signed into multilateral agreements. It can be seen that most of the obstacles to this conference have been cleared. In addition to the points reserved by the preparatory meeting that remain to be discussed, the rest is just to formally pass the resolved cases in the conference. In other words, the road to free trade can be said to have been laid in the two preparatory meetings. Broad and narrow interpretations should be adapted to the spirit of the times. In the current situation, there are very few countries that have unlimited free trade capabilities. Even countries that have not yet recovered their strength must use various methods to control imports and encourage exports in order to balance international payments. The development of American industry and the increase in employment can be said to have reached the highest level, but President Truman recently announced in Congress that he would also control exports. It is even more obvious that other industrially backward countries, with their weak foundations and unable to withstand strong external forces, must pay attention to appropriate protection policies. Therefore, at the two preparatory meetings, countries argued fiercely about this issue; when the draft was passed in Geneva, they had to adopt a compromise to coordinate the interests of all parties. Finally, the United States and France also agreed separately that the tax rates reduced during France's enrichment period could be temporarily suspended.

The so-called multilateral tariff agreement, although its goal is to reduce tax rates to promote trade between related countries, its scope is limited to related countries. In this way, many small tariff groups are created between countries, replacing the individual tariff barriers in each country, which is still far from the goal of universal economic coordination and completely eliminating international economic conflicts.

From the first preparatory meeting to the formal conference, eight countries, including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, [Blank], Saudi Arabia, and Abyssinia, have never participated. Although it is stipulated in the draft that they can apply to join later, all resolutions passed are of course not binding until they have obtained the qualifications of member states; thus, international trade at least maintains two major camps. Moreover, after the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to mutually reduce tariffs, the preferential tariff system of the British Empire Group was not completely abolished?

In addition, what actually hinders free trade is not only those barriers between countries, but also the excessive poverty of most countries. Because of the lack of foreign exchange, poverty hinders imports; because of the lack of materials, poverty blocks exports. Therefore, before industries are developed, purchasing power is increased, international payments are balanced, and employment rates in various countries are universally improved, even if trade barriers are completely eliminated, the scope of so-called free trade will still be limited.

In short, we naturally have deep expectations for this International Trade and Employment Conference. According to the achievements of the past two preparatory meetings and the enthusiasm of various countries to participate, the achievements of this conference can also be expected. However, with the lineup still incomplete and poverty in the majority, so-called free trade may not have satisfactory progress in the near future. However, from the perspective of reducing obstacles to international cooperation to promote world peace and happiness, this is a powerful tool after all. We would like to wish the true advent of free trade here, and promise to devote ourselves to the task until the very end.

### Hankou Cracks Down on Air Transport of Gold Case

(Continued from Page 1) Recently, various military radio stations here have been receiving a strange type of code, disrupting radio waves. After much investigation by the Criminal Police Team, it was learned that this code was mostly sent from Hong Kong and Guangzhou and was related to gold smuggling. Yesterday morning, a code was received stating that goods would be transported by air from Guangzhou to Hankou. The team sent many cadres to wait at the Wuchang Airport. At 3:00 PM, a China Airlines passenger plane landed, and two people got off the plane. One person went to greet them, and their behavior was very suspicious. They were followed to the wharf and inspected. Eighty-nine bars of gold, weighing 534 taels, were found in their suitcases. They were immediately taken to the bureau for questioning along with the person who greeted them. According to the interrogation results, one of the two men was Gan Lin, an employee of Zao Miao [Blank] Company, and the other was Xiong Jieming. The other person who greeted them was Lan Ziyuan, the manager of Zao Miao [Blank] Company. They confessed that they had transported gold three times. The first time was 370 bars, the second time was 60 bars, and this was the third time. It was also learned that the protagonist of this case was Hu Haigan, and its inside story involved more than a dozen banks, gold shops, and commercial firms in the city. They had also established a communication network of trading houses in various places. The organization was quite large. The Criminal Police are still searching and will not stop until the case is solved.

### Cotton Yarn Allocation Trial Measures

### Guangzhou Middle School Teachers Face Difficult Living Conditions, Appeal for Help

A letter to the mayor, every word a tear. [Our Guangzhou dispatch dated 23rd] Teachers in Guangzhou's municipal middle schools, as newly-appointed teachers have not yet received their salaries, and commodity prices are soaring, their lives are on the verge of desperation. On the 23rd, they specially sent representatives to appeal to the mayor for help, stating in the letter: "Holding a teaching position, ranking among the poor scholars, knowing fate, being content with poverty, loving fame, and guarding integrity, eating one meal every two days to stay alive, nine meals in thirty days, awaiting support. Pitiable are the cries of our parents, unbearable the tears of our wives and children. Although we want to endure hunger to teach and force a smile, the sound of reading is loud, but the mood is desolate. If further delayed, we will surely die. What is pitiable is that our parents, wives, and children will turn to the ditches, and our students will have no one to teach." Every word is a tear, filled with sorrow. Although some schools here have launched a ten thousand yuan labor-to-teach campaign, it is already a case of "too little, too late" for the teachers.

### Full Text of the Judgment Reasoning of Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Liu Bojin (Part 1)

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou] Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Liu Bojin, who were arrested in the same case as Yu Zisan from Zhejiang University, were sentenced by the Zhejiang High Court at 10:00 AM on the 20th to seven years of imprisonment each. The text of the judgment is as follows: It has been verified that the defendants Chen Jianxin, Huang Shimin, and Deng Bojin, and the deceased Yu Zisan were classmates at Zhejiang University and were ideologically left-leaning. All were members of the New Tide Society, with Chen Jianxin serving as the president of the society and in charge of liaison affairs, Huang Shimin serving as the head of the society's accounting division, and Liu Bojin serving as the head of the society's academic preparation division. The society had a reading club organization that collected various left-wing books and newspapers, circulated them among members, and produced reading reports. Furthermore, they opened the Fangfeng Farm in the Su Dynasty area near Fenghua, Zhejiang, to raise funds. New Tide Societies were established in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Taiwan, Fenghua, Pinghu, and other places. When Wang Jingxiu, a member of the society, got married in Hangzhou, Chen Jianxin and Huang Shimin brought a large number of reactionary books, newspapers, and letters to Hangzhou from Shanghai on October 25th of this year and stayed at the Datong Hotel on Yanling Road in Hangzhou with Yu Zisan and Li Bojin. They were arrested late at night. These facts have been admitted separately by the defendants during the investigation by the prosecutor of this court and during the trial in this court. They are consistent with the transcript of Yu Zisan's talks during his lifetime and the secret reports of the original arresting agency. Furthermore, there is evidence of reactionary left-wing books and newspapers (Political Common Sense, How to Study Dialectical Materialism, The Poverty of Philosophy, Wage Labor and Capital, Times Magazine, Zhanwang Magazine, World Knowledge, Times and Literature Magazine, etc.) seized on the spot, as well as letters from Wang Xia, a member of the society in Taiwan, and Peng Changhu, a member of the society in Nanjing. It is justifiable to consider them as true. Although the defendants denied that they were Communist Party members during the trial in this court and claimed that the New Tide Society they participated in was a private gathering dedicated to academic research, different from the New Tide Society, a secret organization external to the Communist Party. There was especially no competition for representatives of student self-government associations at all levels, secretly participating in the All-China Student Federation led by the Chinese Communist Party, inciting student unrest, or planning for the Communist Party's subversive plans. However, after reviewing the second transcript of Yu Zisan's talks on October 29th after Yu Zisan's arrest, sent by the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command:

Yu Zisan's talk transcript "Q" Are you still the chairman of the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association? "A" I am still in office, but I really want to get rid of this position. "Q" On the one hand, you want to get rid of this duty (on the other hand, you are preparing to strive for success in the re-election, is this not a great contradiction with what you claim? "A" Yes, I also feel the contradiction myself. "Q" Your school is preparing to establish a general election mechanism. A general election is a kind of open campaign. Why do you want to lead a small organization and secretly predetermine the representatives of each department? And these people are mostly members of the New Tide Society and the Reading Club. Obviously, you have a conspiracy to manipulate representative seats. "A" It is indeed not very right, but I myself do not know why I want to do this. It seems that there is always some force pushing me behind. "Q" What is the most powerful force? "A" Someone ordered me to do this. "Q" Who? "A" I can't say now. "Q" Why does the New Tide Society take the form of secret activities, and the books you read are all thoroughly reactionary? You red-ify a person, starting with various reactionary basic philosophies, and using the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Four Big Families as educational tools. Does this conform to the purpose of promoting democracy and developing social prosperity that your New Tide Society promotes? (Silent, no answer) "Q" What are the main activities of the New Tide Society at present? "A" 1. Contacting members in various places, extensively opening up various activities of the society, and absorbing members. 2. Developing production undertakings to enrich the society's funds (such as the Taoyuan in Fenghua, which is one of the productions). 3. Striving for the representative list of the Zhejiang University Student Self-Government Association. 4. Organizing a propaganda club inside and outside the school, with Xiang Bojin in charge, mutually researching and circulating various Communist Party theoretical books and newspapers.

### France's Situation Remains Precarious, Strikes Expand, Railway Traffic Severed, Schuman's Cabinet Gains Parliamentary Support

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] France is in the midst of a wave of strikes, and has been without a government for four days. The main difficulty facing the new Prime Minister is the opposition of left-wing Socialists to any government that does not intend to continue state control of the economy. It is reported that a faction led by Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet has made continued state control a condition for joining Schuman's cabinet. Schuman, on the other hand, is considered to be a proponent of easing state control of the economy. At the same time, the strike wave launched by the Communist Party has penetrated into the core of the French economy, with approximately one million workers on strike.

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Prime Minister Schuman conducted cabinet formation talks late into the night. He stated at 4:00 AM this morning that more rapid progress is expected when the talks continue this afternoon. Earlier, former Prime Minister Blum personally came forward to persuade Socialist Party members to reconcile with Schuman on the economic policies of the new government. Blum contacted Schuman and his Socialist colleagues by phone overnight. The Socialist Party, under the leadership of its Secretary-General Mollet, seems to disagree with the views of former Prime Minister Ramadier. Ramadier is unwilling to serve as Deputy Prime Minister in charge of financial and economic affairs unless he is given the freedom to handle the responsibilities under his jurisdiction. After meeting with party leaders for seven hours, Schuman reported to President Auriol.

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] Robert Schuman of the Popular Republican Movement was officially appointed Prime Minister tonight. The National Assembly passed a vote of confidence by a vote of 412 to 184, with 21 abstentions or absences. Communists and their sympathizers voted against, while the De Gaulle faction voted in favor or abstained. Earlier, Schuman declared in the Assembly that defending France would be his duty and that he would strictly distinguish between the legitimate demands of workers and the events taking place in various parts of Europe, hoping to form a new cabinet to deal with the strikes immediately. At the same time, under the leadership of the General Confederation of Labor, which is manipulated by the Communist Party, the number of strikers has exceeded 750,000. There are fears of riots breaking out in Paris tomorrow. Many trucks are full of military police, carrying guns into the city to prevent emergencies. After the public heard of the destruction of four important secret military depots and the cutting of telephone lines in suburban fortresses by rioters last night, their emotions were clearly uneasy. In addition, according to the police station, one quart of concentrated tear gas was stolen from a certain factory last night. After the explosion at the Renault car factory, two Communist workers were arrested for manufacturing bombs there. Partial strikes by national railway and merchant marine workers, as well as metallurgy, construction, coal mining, shipyards, flour mills, and school education in the Paris region, have been caught up in the vortex. Trains are completely stopped between the southeast and Paris-Lyon, and traffic north of Paris has also been severed. Sailors of merchant ships in Marseilles, Bordeaux, Nantes, and Rouen have responded to the striking workers in shipyards in major cities. Longshoremen in Le Havre are scheduled to strike tomorrow.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] The Marseilles City Council convened its first meeting today since Communist Party and De Gaulle faction members clashed ten days ago. Communist Party members withdrew from the meeting as a protest against the presence of an armed guard in the chamber.

### The Four Powers Have Differences of Opinion on the German Question, the Future of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is Bleak, Molotov Arrives in London via Berlin

[Report from this newspaper] London, 23rd Broadcasting: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov flew to this city from Berlin today in preparation for attending the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which will open on Tuesday.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to open on Tuesday, but no agreement has yet been reached on a draft agenda. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union, on the other, will each present an agenda. Therefore, the main task of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is to decide the order in which the items will be discussed. There is also no agreement on the report of the Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies. Therefore, each representative may have to submit a separate report to their Foreign Minister.

[United Press, London, 22nd] The British Foreign Office frankly admitted that the success or failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference depends entirely on Molotov's attitude. If Mr. Molotov's attitude is more reasonable than the Soviet attitude in the Council of Deputies, Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to do his best to reach an agreement. Otherwise, the conference could break down in three days.

### Sokolovsky Fires the Opening Shot, Clay Expresses Regret

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] On the eve of his departure for London to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference, US Military Governor General Clay hosted a press conference, expressing regret over the statement made by Soviet Military Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky yesterday. He felt that the points made by Sokolovsky were not new and did not understand his purpose. When asked whether he was optimistic about the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference, he replied, "If I express optimism, it is because the situation of no agreement has reached an extreme, so there is a possibility of a turning point. Today, all the major powers involved have admitted that the governing bodies in Germany have actually ceased to function. This is something that has never happened before the Foreign Ministers' Conference."

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Sokolovsky, the Soviet Military Commander-in-Chief in Germany, made a harsh attack on the Western powers at the meeting of the Allied Control Council, making people believe that the spirit of compromise will be lacking when the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference opens. Observers place more emphasis on the timing of this attack than on its content, as most of the accusations are old tunes that have already been answered by those who were attacked. What is noteworthy is that this attack was published on the eve of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and TASS immediately gave it widespread coverage. Soviet representative Smirnov of the Foreign Ministers' Deputies already stated last week that world opinion is always willing to know to what extent disarmament and the purge of Nazis have been implemented, implying that the Soviet Union will raise the issue of how Western countries are controlling Germany at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Sokolovsky has now gone a step further in condemning the failure of the three occupying authorities in the West to fulfill the Four Power resolutions, which is tantamount to foreshadowing the Soviet Union's attitude at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. A senior official of the British Control Commission has already stated, "Sokolovsky's statement is the opening shot of the Foreign Ministers' Conference."

### The Soviet Union Accumulates Gold to Strike at the Marshall Plan

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd] According to Burins, an expert on Soviet economic affairs, the Soviet Union is secretly hoarding large amounts of gold as a weapon to curb the Marshall Plan for European recovery. In an article in the current issue of "United Nations World" magazine, Burins pointed out that the Soviet Union's hoarding of gold is the "strong economic substance" behind the warning issued by Zhdanov, Secretary-General of the Communist Party Central Committee. Burins believes that the Soviet Union can establish a strict ruble zone within its sphere of influence and set its currency to the gold standard in other parts of the world. In important trade areas, it can effectively counter the US dollar and replace the British pound. This move will interfere with the US dollar's monopoly in the current international trade market and dramatically affect the price structure in the international market. The Soviet Union's Institute of World Economy has declared that many gold mines have been discovered in the Soviet Union over the past 15 years, so it has risen from the world's fifteenth-largest gold-producing country in 1926 to second place in 1936. Today, it may have risen to first place. It is estimated that the Soviet Union currently has gold worth approximately US$17 billion, only about US$5 billion less than the United States.

### French Franc Circulates in Saar, Soviet Side Protests

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 22nd] The German News Agency of the US Military District stated that General Koenig, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in Germany, said at the Allied Control Council meeting yesterday that France has implemented the French franc in accordance with the will of the people. The British and American representatives stated that they would make a statement on this matter later, while the Soviet representative Sokolovsky expressed protest against France's presentation to the Allied Control Council as a fait accompli and stated that it would be followed soon with an investigation.

### Greece Requests Italian Ships

Former Territorial Investigation Committee to Listen to Opinions of Local Italians

[Reuters, Athens, 22nd] The Athens News Agency stated that Greece will request to share in Italian naval vessels when four naval experts meet in Rome on December 1 to discuss the distribution of Italian ships.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The four foreign ministers' representatives discussing the former Italian territories recently decided that the four-power committee investigating the former Italian territories must listen to the opinions of Italian immigrants in the area. The manner of listening shall be determined by the investigation committee. The representatives also decided that the opinions raised by Abyssinia, Italy, and Egypt should be handed over to the investigation committee for investigation to determine whether there are any inconsistencies with the facts. The representatives also acknowledged the documents of the governments of the related countries and resolved to notify the related countries in January of the date for attending the meeting to present their opinions. The Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies will not meet again before the end of the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### US House Subcommittee Drafts Conditions for US Foreign Aid, Recommends Establishment of Dedicated Foreign Aid Agency

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The US House Committee on Foreign Aid Plans recently released its preliminary report, outlining conditions for countries receiving assistance. The report explains that while these conditions are specifically tailored for Western Europe, the general principles listed therein can also be applied to other countries requiring US assistance in the future.

The committee recommends that, in order to meet the genuine needs of recipient countries as early as possible, restore their economies as quickly as possible, and avoid placing an excessive burden on the US economy, the following points must be considered when formulating or implementing any aid plan: Recipient countries should correct their fiscal, financial, and monetary weaknesses in order to stabilize foreign exchange rates and restore the credibility of their currencies; Recipient countries should strive to increase food and material production to address their fundamental domestic needs; Recipient countries should promote the economic exchange of their own goods and labor in order to effectively allocate and utilize their own and foreign resources, while also seeking to reduce foreign exchange controls, commercial quotas, and other measures that hinder trade; Countries other than the United States that can provide assistance should cooperate to the greatest extent possible; Encourage and facilitate private sector engagement in emergency actions, which are currently handled by the government in this crisis; Recipient countries should fully and publicly disclose the use, source, nature, and quantity of US assistance. The committee also recommends the establishment of a new federal agency called the Emergency Foreign Reconstruction Bureau to implement the aid plan, with an executive committee for each country, including representatives from both the United States and the recipient country; In addition, a Foreign Aid Committee should be established, comprising the Secretary of State and other cabinet members, to advise and consult the President on aid plans and policies.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] It was learned today that the Senate is expected to approve President Truman's European Emergency Relief Act next week, but the domestic price controls and long-term foreign aid proposals are still pending. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg is scheduled to appear on the 24th, requesting the rapid allocation of $597 million to assist France, Italy, and Austria in resisting the dual threats of political turmoil and starvation, and to allow Congress sufficient time to conduct a thorough and detailed review of the Marshall Plan's long-term aid program for the reconstruction of sixteen Western European countries after the bill's passage. According to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges, the committee will investigate US food supplies before voting on the emergency aid bill in order to carefully consider the needs of France, Italy, and Austria.

### Turbulent French Political Situation Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Department

The fear that American aid may come too late, perhaps too late to save France from collapse, is growing daily. Moderate elements in France are deliberately slowing down the pace of recovery in an attempt to curb inflation, as recovery requires money. However, this plan is not easy to gain popular support and is extremely difficult or even impossible to implement. The Communist Party is leading strikes, anti-communists are hoarding wheat and gold as political capital, and moderates are losing ground.

The severity of the French crisis can be gleaned from a cable from the Paris correspondent of the "World Report Weekly," who said:

Although wage standards are the same as during the Charles de Gaulle era, prices have risen sharply. Official food prices rose by almost 25 percent in August alone. Industrial products, raw materials, and dairy products are almost eight times higher than in 1938. However, official prices are not representative of market prices. For example, white bread cannot be bought at all on the market at official prices; the black market price is several times higher than the official price.

Tax evasion has reached its peak. Most of the government's revenue comes from workers' income taxes, as this tax is deducted directly from wages. As a result, the burden on labor is increasing, making wage increases unavoidable. The government's greatest difficulty is that it cannot implement any effective reforms before the end of the year.

The low value of the franc reflects the weakness of the French financial economy. France's gold reserves have fallen from a high of $2.709 billion in 1939 to $544 million. However, as reserves have decreased, inflation has increased. According to statistics, the amount of banknotes issued in France in 1939 was 151 billion francs, which has now increased to 874 billion francs.

At the beginning of this year, the government estimated that the French could purchase $1.14 billion in national bonds, but the bonds did not sell, and the maturing bonds had to be paid in cash. France now has no domestic deposits and no US dollars abroad to meet daily expenditures. In the 1948 fiscal year, the country's revenue is approximately $5.5 billion, while expenditures are approximately $8 billion. In order to balance the budget, major austerity measures must be taken.

According to the above estimates, the amount of austerity measures is approximately $2.5 billion. Some austerity measures that can be implemented without parliamentary restrictions are already being implemented. The number of officers in the army will be reduced by 15 percent; the construction of a new aircraft carrier has been halted; and only half of those who should be undergoing military service training will be called up before January 1.

If approved by parliament, nationally funded post-war reconstruction will be temporarily suspended; compensation for wartime losses to the public will be postponed; reconstruction work in various regions should be funded locally; bank loans will be regulated; the interest rate on loans from the Bank of France has been increased from 1.75 percent to 2.5 percent; loans will not be available to those without legitimate needs; and merchants must sell their hoarded goods on the market before borrowing money.

This plan is welcomed by Washington, as US government officials have always believed that the French are spending too much money, but it has met with resistance in France. Workers are demanding wage increases and opposing the rise of the de Gaulle faction, leading to numerous strikes, which may paralyze the entire French economy. The hoarding of wheat by farmers and the hoarding of gold by capitalists make inflation even more difficult to control.

If the moderates cannot strive to maintain their position until American aid arrives, then France may see a new regime emerge, and the characteristics of this regime will certainly not be moderate. (Translated from "World Report Weekly")

### Financial Agreement Established for British-American Merged Zone in Germany All Occupation Costs in Both Zones Borne by the United States

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Source from Gouwei: All unresolved points in the negotiations between Britain and the United States on revising the rules of the British-American merged zone in Germany have been agreed upon in principle. Representatives from both sides are working on organizing the revised text, which is expected to be formally announced simultaneously in London and Washington next week. The agreements reached include: The British side agrees to convert the surplus of approximately £18 million in the joint export department accounts of the merged zone into US dollars, but to avoid an immediate reduction in Britain's US dollar reserves, sudden full acceptance will not be required. From January 1, 1948, the United States will bear all US dollar costs for both zones, so the United States will have more say in the disposal of funds in the two zones. However, the principle of equal responsibility between Britain and the United States for the administrative responsibilities of the merged zone will not be changed. A definite proportion of goods to be imported by Britain from the sterling zone into the British-American merged zone is stipulated. It is reported that this agreement does not take into account the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, so if the Foreign Ministers' Conference fails and France decides to join the merger, a new approach will have to be drafted.

### British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison Says British Economic Situation Improving Churchill Condemns Labor Government for Misleading the Country

[Reuters, Yorkshire, 23rd] Deputy Prime Minister Morrison delivered a speech during the encouragement production movement here, claiming that various signs indicate that Britain will soon be able to overcome its current difficulties. It is generally believed that Morrison's speech this time is the most optimistic among the statements made by various cabinet ministers.

He said: Although there is a shortage of food and raw materials, and there are still many difficulties, there are signs of progress in the most important parts of the entire economic front, namely basic and export industries. Britain's current production is at its highest peak in five years, engineering industrial production has exceeded pre-war levels, and iron production has also reached a record high. Today may be the beginning of our great revival.

[United Press, London, 22nd] Opposition Conservative Party leader Churchill claimed on the 22nd that if the Labor government continues to govern, Britain will be completely plunged into bankruptcy and famine. Churchill said: The socialist government is not worthy of the people's trust, and its regime was obtained through false promises.

### Soviet Artillery Day

[Reuters, Moscow, 23rd] The Soviet Union celebrated Artillery Day nationwide today, with 20-gun salutes fired in Moscow, Leningrad, the capitals of various republics, and major cities. Soviet Artillery Commander V. I. Kazakov made a broadcast on the eve of Artillery Day, stating that world imperialism is preparing another war to destroy democracy and socialism, so Soviet artillery and other Soviet military units must be in a state of constant readiness, and every soldier, from private to general, must do their best to make Soviet artillery the world's leader.

### Law to Ban Fascism Passed by Italian Parliament

### US Industrialists Attack Pepper

[United Press, Jacksonville, Florida, 22nd] Several industrialists began a campaign against Senator Pepper on the 22nd, after Pepper denounced them as "a selfish and reactionary group that has been trying to remove Roosevelt from office for twelve years."

### Cominform to Issue Important Declaration European Communist Leaders in Frequent Contact

[United Press, Prague, 23rd] Political observers here are closely awaiting a major new strategy declaration from the Cominform on the European "Cold War" tactics. Observers say important talks are underway to adjust the Communist Party's policies on recent international events.

Reliable sources report that Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi was in Moscow earlier this week. French Communist Party leader Thorez has been in Moscow for an extended stay since early November. Yugoslav President Tito appeared in Sarajevo on the 23rd, and plans to meet with Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov in Sofia on the 23rd have been postponed. Dimitrov returned to Sofia on the 20th after a "long vacation." Observers say that the time has come for the Cominform to issue a declaration, as the following developments have occurred since the bureau adjourned in Poland on September 28: The US Special Congress will vote on the Marshall Plan; The Four Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in London; The French and Italian Communist Parties have stepped up anti-government strikes and unrest; After clearing out opposition figures such as Mikolajczyk, the governments of Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland participating in the Cominform in Eastern Europe have consolidated their rule; The United States has strengthened its aid to Greece. Communist sources believe that Polish Workers' Party (i.e., Communist Party) Secretary-General Gomulka is the most promising candidate to serve as the permanent chairman of the Belgrade Cominform. Gomulka is currently the Polish Prime Minister and Minister of the Recovered Territories of Silesia, and was also the chairman of the Warsaw Conference. The Cominform's first plan is to publish a publication containing Party instructions and speeches, and editorial and printing departments have already begun work in the Yugoslav capital this month.

### Current UN General Assembly Session Lasts Ten Weeks US-Soviet Divide Becomes More Apparent China Announces Support for Partition of Holy Land

[United Press, Lake Success, 23rd] As the United Nations General Assembly draws to a close, the consensus of most delegates is that the main achievement of this session has been the further division between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Most delegates believe that the votes in the General Assembly over the past ten weeks clearly indicate that in the showdown between the economic and ideological power of the United States and the Soviet Union, at least three-quarters of the countries support the United States.

The atmosphere is somber at the close of the General Assembly, and the number of delegates privately pessimistic about the future of the United Nations is increasing daily. The Soviet Union seems to be gradually separating itself from the actual work of the United Nations, while still showing no inclination to formally withdraw from the alliance. The Balkan Observer Group, the Little General Assembly, and the United Nations Commission on Korea have caused three major divisions. The United States initiated these three proposals, and despite the strongest opposition from the Soviet Union, they were eventually passed by the General Assembly, while the Soviet Union announced that it would boycott them all. Most delegates agree that without Soviet participation, the United Nations is unlikely to achieve concrete results in the three areas of the Balkans, Korea, and the Little General Assembly. The only agreement that the US and the Soviet Union were able to reach was on the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states.

[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd] China announced today at the United Nations General Assembly that it supports the partition plan for Palestine, ending its hesitant attitude. Hsu Wei-chun said that while partition is not a completely satisfactory solution, this is due to the extreme opposition from the Arabs, but the partition policy is the only way to solve the problem and may be successful. He said that peace in the Middle East depends on the early resolution of the Palestinian issue, and he hopes that time will allow partition to gradually take effect.

He said that China was unwilling to announce its support for partition until the last minute, as it continued to hope that a reconciliation could be achieved between the Jews and Arabs. However, reconciliation seems impossible at present, so China must express its position on the decision-making. He said that if this session of the General Assembly does not take action, then near peace will be impossible.

### Mass Grave of 10,000 People Discovered in US Zone of Germany

[Reuters, Hammelburg, US Zone of Germany, 22nd] Six large graves containing bodies of sixty-eight nationalities have been discovered in a forest near Hammelburg in the central US zone. Officials from the International Refugee Organization who saw these mass graves said that 11,000 of the bodies were buried individually, presumably due to death from malnutrition and other causes.

### Burmese Buddhist Delegation to Visit China

[Reuters, Rangoon, 22nd] A Burmese Buddhist delegation of seven monks will travel to China soon. All seven speak Chinese.

### Dispute Over Nationalization of Coal Mines How Many Days Have Members of Parliament Fought Again? Opposition Parties Blame Speaker for Negligence

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] The ruling party and opposition parties in Japan continued to argue over the coal mine nationalization bill in the House of Representatives this afternoon, resulting in a fight. First, Liberal Party member Cho-taro Imamura attempted to cross the parliamentary guards and confront House Speaker Komakichi Matsuoka. Ten guards stepped forward to block Imamura, and another Liberal Party member took the opportunity to rush to the podium, causing great chaos during the meeting. Order was not restored until after a few minutes.

Since the fight that occurred during the discussion of the coal mine nationalization bill on the 20th, guards have been stationed in front of the House of Representatives podium. In addition, Democratic Party Executive Committee member Tokuya Koyama voted against the coal mine nationalization bill along with the Liberal Party, so the Democratic Party revoked his membership on the Executive Committee.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The report of the chairman of the Committee on Industry and Mining, Shiro Ito, continued at the plenary session of the House of Representatives from 8:30 pm on the 22nd. The government seems to be planning to submit the amendments of the three ruling parties on the 24th, immediately begin voting, and forcibly pass them with the absolute majority of the ruling parties. In addition, the three ruling parties, the Socialists, Democrats, and National Cooperation Party, agreed on the night of the 22nd to successively submit important bills such as the Anti-Monopoly Law and supplementary budgets to the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 23rd, and want to pass them all at once. However, the opposition parties, centered on the Liberal Party, are considering measures to prevent this. Furthermore, the Liberal Party held a meeting of members at 7:00 pm on the 22nd, believing that the chaos at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 22nd was the responsibility of the Speaker, and that the matters resolved should be legally invalid, and decided to pursue the responsibility of Speaker Matsuoka.

### Iran Responds to Soviet Protest

[Reuters, Tehran, 23rd] The Iranian cabinet discussed today the reply to the Soviet protest letter drafted by Prime Minister Sultan Suleimanov. According to people close to the Prime Minister, the Iranian government's response refuted the main points of the Soviet protest letter. The Soviet Union pointed out that Sultan Suleimanov should not have waited a year to submit the oil agreement to the parliament. The Iranian government replied that there was no parliament in existence during that year, and that the report on the oil agreement negotiation was not a legislative proposal of the Iranian government. The Iranian government replied that the Iranian law promulgated in December 1944 prohibits officials from negotiating transfers of rights with foreign countries, so the Prime Minister had no right to submit a legislative proposal to the parliament. The Soviet Union pointed out that Britain already enjoys oil rights in Iran, so Iran is discriminating against the Soviet Union. The Iranian government replied that the transfer of oil rights to Britain was made when Iran did not yet have a constitution, so it was impossible to seek the opinion of the people.

### Yokosuka and Three Other Ports to Be Transferred to US Military Use Both US and Japan Express Enthusiastic Approval

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] The US House Armed Services Committee has recommended that once a peace treaty with Japan is signed, Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Kure ports be transferred to the United States for use as naval bases. American land, sea and air forces, and the Japanese side, all enthusiastically approved this proposal on the 23rd. A naval authority pointed out: The Yokosuka base has already proven to be the most valuable base for naval operations in the Far East, and is currently able to supply the needs of the entire fleet. The Americanization and democratization of Yokosuka also have a major impact on the Japanese people, as the port has been under the secret control of the Japanese Navy for many years. Before and during the war, most of the Japanese people were excluded from this area. Now, the US military has opened it up and begun to transform this dark underground city into a clean and bright naval base. Thousands of Japanese people are proud of the construction of this place according to American standards, and the opening of the base has provided jobs for thousands of Japanese people, and the economic situation of the city has been turned from danger to safety.

There were many people who went to the polling stations to fulfill their civic obligations yesterday morning, but because most of them were illiterate, they could only use the help of the administrators to point to any one of the candidate's names, and then ask others to write the election ticket. This special election method is called "Dian Qiuxiang" by students. The close relationship between education and democracy is thought-provoking.

### Sincere Voter Young Woman Insists on Voting for Chairman Chiang

At the No. 4 polling station in Luwan District, a young woman wearing a cheongsam and carrying a vegetable basket asked the administrator to write "Chairman Chiang" on her ballot at 10:00 am yesterday morning. Even after the administrator explained that the chairman was not a candidate, she still insisted on her own opinion. Finally, she was happy to leave only after personally watching the administrator write "Chiang Kai-shek" on the ballot and put it into the ballot box.

During the War of Resistance, it persevered for many years without any foreign aid and did not yield. Now, if there is foreign aid, we are of course grateful. If there is no foreign aid, we can still get by. Now, we only seek order and stability and improvement of people's livelihoods." The tea party adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

### Scalpers Still Active at Movie Theaters "Vote for Me"

Various movie theaters in the city have repeatedly established penalty rules and cooperated with the police to arrest scalpers due to their activity, but to no avail. The activity is particularly rampant whenever a new film is released. The leader of the scalpers, Xiong Yi, is also using various disguises to avoid police attention, sometimes wearing a melton Zhongshan suit, looking like a civil servant, lining up to buy tickets, or selling them publicly with a "treating-guests" attitude. Since the new war film "Sea Bee Heroes" was released at the Carlton and Lido theaters the day before yesterday, the audience has been extremely crowded every day, and the scalpers have even engaged in large-scale hoarding. In the midst of full houses, the scalpers have almost completely booked the theaters for the next few days. Movie fans vainly line up, and in the end, they still have to ask the scalpers to "vote for me," but they all grind their teeth in hatred.

### Qian Zhengfu, Head of the Zhenru Plant Team of the Executive Yuan, Acquitted on Retrial

### Banquet Inspection Still Many [Issues] Tomorrow Meeting to Discuss New Ya's Embarrassment Insulting Juvenile Police Will Be Fined and Ordered to Suspend Business for Several Days

[Our Newspaper] It has been several days since the juvenile police team reported on the simple banquet inspection. The Social Bureau will convene a review meeting tomorrow to discuss technical issues in the implementation. Yesterday, the reporter visited several members of the juvenile police team and the team leader, Hu Bangwei. According to them, the general situation has been smooth since the inspection work began. Most diners and shop owners can accept their persuasion, but an unpleasant dispute occurred at the New Ya Hotel that day. Because the store sold luxury foods such as shark fin and sea cucumber, the juvenile police gave advice that was not listened to. While inspecting the cold storage room, the store's chefs and tea waiters surrounded them and smeared oil powder on the juvenile police's clothes. The juvenile police wanted to call and report to the bureau, but were also prevented. Later, Hu Team Leader and the Lao Zha branch received a report and sent personnel to resolve the situation. The main perpetrator, tea waiter Lu Pei, No. 73, has been detained by the Lao Zha branch. The New Ya Restaurant's violation of frugality has been reported to the competent authority and will be punished with a suspension of business for several days. As for the main difficulties in the inspection, it lies in the imperfect or inconsistent nature of certain laws and regulations. For example: Regarding luxury goods such as sea cucumber and shark fin, the Social Bureau has a regulation that "they must not be sold again after the stock is sold out," but it is difficult to ascertain when the stock is sold out. It is difficult to determine whether what is currently sold in restaurants is stock or new goods. Small account issues. The Social Bureau's regulations are that no extra demands may be made outside of the 20% service charge. However, the police law in the police department stipulates that there must be no small accounts other than the official account. Then, which one should be followed during implementation? The price of a frugal banquet is stipulated not to exceed 1.2 million yuan per table and not to exceed 120,000 yuan per person, but sometimes there are eleven or twelve people sitting at one table. In this case, 120,000 yuan per person does not exceed the limit, but the total amount per table exceeds the limit. All of these are difficulties in the implementation, which will be raised for discussion at tomorrow's meeting. The juvenile police are currently living in the Caohejing Reformatory because the police station's dormitory has not yet been settled. They come to the urban area at 10:00 every morning and are sent back to Caohejing at 10:00 in the evening.

(Another news) It is heard that the kitchens of Luo Deji, Ma Leji, and other four restaurants have been found to have violated the frugality regulations and will be given warnings separately.

### Blind Education Facilities Fail to Adapt to Society

An Echo of a Blind Person with Unlimited Grief Hope for More Spiritual and Material Guidance and Assistance

The special article "Experiencing the World Entirely Through Touch" in this newspaper on November 10 used facts to prove that we blind people, with innate talents and acquired knowledge, perform no less than ordinary people, prompting society to pay attention to the development of blind education and careers, so as to save the more than five million blind compatriots, all of whom can get the opportunity to recycle waste. However, can we blind people who have received this special education be adapted to the real society? There is an unspeakable feeling! The special article in this newspaper mentioned Mr. Song Guanlin, Zhang Peixin, and Wu Guobiao, who are outstanding figures in the Chinese blind community. Mr. Song is the private secretary of Liu Hongsheng, and Mr. Zhang is the editor of Da Mei Daily. They are both nearing sixty years old and use English and American literature and thinking skills as their lifelong way out. Mr. Wu is a rising star in the blind community. He returned to China after studying in the United States and advocated the Chinese Blind School. Can this organization get the sympathy of the government and society? I think Mr. Wu must have unlimited sadness in his heart.

### Blind People in Europe and the United States Are Treated as One

Blind education and careers cannot be effective without government leadership and social guidance. For example, in the United States and other countries, there are blind bureaus and their welfare organizations, braille books, newspaper publications, special equipment supply, national life, and regarded as one. But where are Chinese blind people! If you lose your eyes and learn to be a fortune teller, you can make a living, and if you know a few braille characters and learn some new skills for blind people (such as stringing rattan, knitting nets, music, typing, etc.), you can't even get enough to eat, or even if you are proficient in vocational skills and proficient in European and American literature, no one will ask you for advice. The crux of this problem is that the country is in trouble, people's hearts are uneasy, education facilities are not as good as their reputation, and there are more and more unemployed people, who cannot take care of our waste products, and the failure of blind education facilities to adapt to the real society for decades is the biggest mistake. This problem is quite serious. Ten years under the window is ignorant

### Ten Years Under the Window is Ignorant

Literacy education is the foundation of education, and writing is a tool for life. European and American characters are all composed of letters. Therefore, the braille invented by the French blind man Brail uses a copper plate to cast squares, and the shape of each square is like the six dots on the dice. He uses a stylus to punch out convex dots on a piece of paper from the square. The number of convex dots and the difference in position can represent each letter. We rely on touch to stroke the convex dots to recognize the word formed by those letters, and we can pronounce the word and understand the meaning of the word. As for our Chinese braille, it was created by foreign missionaries. At first, the blind school in Peiping incorporated all the pronunciations into 408 sound mothers. Later, blind children's schools in Shanghai and other places created and formulated 50 letters based on phonetic symbols for blind people to use. However, the Chinese characters are based on the six books as the body, and not on sounds and letters. You must recognize the characters before you can pronounce the words and understand the meaning of the words. However, we blind people stroke a few phonetic symbols. After ten years under the window, we are still ignorant. How can we recognize the world?

### Can the Blind Career Be Improved

Sure enough, this kind of "dot-shaped" word can never represent the shape of Chinese characters, making Chinese blind people read books but still not literate. But can the future improvement use scientific methods so that we blind people, in addition to stroking a few phonetic symbols, can also stroke the real characters, and feel them at a touch, and in addition to using English typewriters, we can also use Chinese typewriters, and then extend it to the development of blind people's careers, from the city to the countryside, as common as fortune tellers. I am very happy to follow the pioneers of the blind community, such as Song, Zhang, and Wu, to work hard on ideal research on this major issue. At the same time, I also ask people from all walks of life for spiritual and material assistance to live up to the praise of this newspaper "Experiencing the World Entirely Through Touch."

### Cousin Playing with a Gun Auxiliary Police Killed in Tragic Accident With a Loud Bang Brains Splattered

[Our Newspaper] Sun Xilin, a current auxiliary police officer of the Xincheng Police Branch, aged twenty-six, residing at No. 14, Lane 1947, Biande Road, got up shortly after 8:40 yesterday morning. His cousin, Wang Sanmei, who was only twelve years old, came to Sun's room to play. She saw a service pistol placed under the pillow, which aroused her curiosity for a while. She took it out to play with it, and Sun did not stop her. He did not realize that he had loaded the bullets when Sun was on duty the night before. Wang Sanmei was young and ignorant, and soon turned the machine twist. With a loud bang, the bullet hit Sun's head, and his brains splattered. He immediately fell to the ground. Wang was extremely frightened and shouted. After his family arrived, they urgently called an ambulance to take him to the hospital, but he died on the way because of the injury to a vital part. After receiving the report, the Xincheng Police Branch sent personnel to the scene of the incident to investigate and took Wang Sanmei to the bureau for questioning.

### Demolition Incident on Tianmu Road Residents Generally Complain Only One-Tenth of the Announced Demolition Fee and Promises

[Special Article by Our Newspaper] The demolition incident on Tianmu Road is a rather troublesome issue in Shanghai's municipal administration. According to the residents of Tianmu Road, when the residents' representatives petitioned the Municipal Council, Vice Chairman Xu told the representatives that the Municipal Government was preparing 900 million to assist in the demolition and relocation, and there was also a rumor in the council that 700 million would be added to repay the land price. The representatives returned and relayed the intention, and the decision to demolish in six months was promised by the residents. However, on November 16, the Bureau of Public Works suddenly announced a deadline for demolition. In the total amount of 90 million to be collected urgently, the lowest demolition fee was only 12,000 yuan per household. This made things stall. Petitions, kneeling requests, weeping, and finally shouting slogans such as "Whoever comes to demolish the house, fights with whoever" came out. It is said that the reason for this is that the announced demolition fee is only one-tenth of the previous promise.

Business Relies Entirely on Train Passengers

### Business Relies Entirely on Train Passengers

Let's look at the other side of the issue: If the authorities had fulfilled the conditions rumored by the council and actually allocated 1.6 billion for demolition and relocation, would the residents of Tianmu Road have been silent and obeyed? To judge this issue, we must first recognize the situation of Tianmu Road: A total of more than 90 buildings, about 180 households, were listed for demolition on Tianmu Road this time. Among them, in addition to ordinary households, there are 60 shops, 9 of which are cigarette shops that specialize in doing business with fellow villagers who take the train; more than 10 large and small transportation companies are undoubtedly closely related to the business of the station; nearly 10 hotels undoubtedly entrust the source of their lives to the dozens of train passengers every day; not to mention the rest of the restaurants and teahouses. Given that nearly half of the residents maintain a close relationship with the station in terms of location, even with a large amount of subsidies, would they be willing to demolish and relocate? The cry of "Swear to coexist with the house" will inevitably be shouted among them.

### Bearing Humiliation and Insult, Breathing a Sigh of Relief

Many households on Tianmu Road have lived there for more than thirty years. They pointed out that Mr. Li Huiwu used to live in Qingxiangli. When he presided over the difficulty in Zhabei in the Xinhai year, the first righteous banner of restoration was erected in Qingxiangli, and the comrades who launched the uprising before and after the difficulty were all lurking in Qingxiangli. If the Standing Committee commemorates the martyrs, respects virtue and rewards meritorious deeds, this area should not be demolished; they also said that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, Tianmu Road was blocked by the enemy for four years (during the occupation). The residents were humiliated and closed their doors to starve, expecting the sun to shine again. Just by this point, the loyal heart of the lonely minister, the authorities should not demolish it; they also said that many houses on Tianmu Road were destroyed by enemy bullets during the August 13th incident. After the victory, the residents requested reconstruction, and the authorities allowed them to build houses on the spot, and paved water pipes and connected electric wires for them. Now the city appearance has been rectified, and they are fortunate to have taken a breath of relief. How can the authorities bear to order demolition again!

### Occupying the Road on the North Side, Expanding the Road on the South Side

Speaking of these reasons, they also raised the incident of occupying land to build pressure on both roads: Tianmu Road was called "Boundary Road" in the old concession era, facing Xinmin Road across the iron fence. During the occupation, the road bureau under the enemy's rule gradually extended the houses to Xinmin Road. After the victory, the road bureau built more and more. Although the iron fence has been demolished, Xinmin Road is completely unrecognizable. The road surface, which was originally wider than Nanjing Road, is no longer what it used to be. They believed that the responsibility lies with the road bureau, so they specifically proposed the point of "occupying the road on the north side to build houses and demolishing houses on the south side to widen the road" when petitioning, asking what the Standing Committee meant.

### Cigarette Factory Sighs That There Are No Exceptions

It is said that the real estate on Tianmu Road is all owned by Shanghai Commercial Bank, Xinhua Bank, Fuyuan Bank, etc., but they did not express their attitude towards this demolition and land concession incident. Among the rows of demolished houses, the most indignant was a Hui Zhong cigarette factory. He said that we pay 8 billion in cigarette taxes every month, and the contribution to the country cannot be considered small, but the authorities have made no exceptions for him in the face of the imminent crisis; another Zhonghe Transportation Company should receive 6.05 million yuan in demolition fees this time, which is considered lucky on Tianmu Road, but according to his statistics, the demolition loss will be 50 times the cost of this subsidy.

There were originally two cement bunkers at both ends of Tianmu Road. The residents in the concession era called them "forts," but now they have become relics. In the several national crises in the past 20 years, this road has always been at the forefront of the flames of war. Many houses still have scars left on them. If the demolition proposal is realized in the future, this road will gradually disappear in the memories of Shanghai citizens.

### 300 Cars Owned 13 Routes Opened The Public Transportation Company Operates Miserably Preparing to Celebrate the Second Anniversary

The Shanghai Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee, sponsored by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, is preparing for the second anniversary of the company's traffic. The company took over the enemy and puppet urban transportation company in September of the 34th year, and after sorting it out, selected 51 old and dilapidated vehicles that could barely be used for driving, and first opened the first circular route on December 10. It operated miserably and tried its best. Then it expanded and opened the second and third routes, which relied on the unity of the staff to overcome the difficulties. Subsequently, in April of the 35th year, it obtained a loan from the Bank of Communications and purchased 100 T234 Dodge trucks from the Materials Supply Bureau. After the company's technical personnel designed and modified them, some were converted into wooden temporary bodies, and some were converted into the streamlined new vehicles that are running on Road 10 today. The company was able to gradually expand its business.

Up to now, it has 300 vehicles, including 61 streamlined new vehicles (20 of which are being modified and can be completed by the end of the year). The number of routes has also been opened to as many as 13, with about 200,000 passengers daily. Currently, the company has 2,000 employees, of which more than 1,500 are driving personnel, and the rest are technical and other personnel. Welfare facilities are perfect, allowing employees to work with peace of mind. In terms of organization, Zhao Cengjue of the Bureau of Public Works also serves as the director, and other staff members such as Zhang Mingzhu, Niu Zequan, Wu Jinqing, Wang Zongshan, Shen Sanduo, Zhang Deqing, and Ding Weitang are all well-known figures in the domestic transportation industry. The senior officials of the company have a meeting once a week to promote business operations, which is personally presided over by Director Zhao, and the opinions of various units are widely accepted, and the company's policies are discussed and decided, fully implementing democratization. It is heard that the company is currently preparing to add the 14th and 15th routes, which can be opened within the year. The preparations for the second anniversary of the opening of traffic on the 10th of next month have been concrete, and meritorious employees will be awarded medals separately, and Mayor Wu will be invited to preside over the event.

### Six Policemen Loyal to Their Duties and Diligent in Their Work Commended by the President

[Our Newspaper] Wu Zhenyue, Zhang Kaiyun, Dai Rude, Tian Shunrong, Xiao Wenbin, and Xi Hanyou, six court police officers of the Shanghai Local Court Detention Center, escorted 60 convicted prisoners to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison for execution at 3:00 PM on the 21st of last month. On the way, three prisoners, Zhu Gaojin, etc., suddenly jumped out of the car and fled. Wu and others bravely chased and captured the three prisoners.

### Fang Zhichao Hired as Consultant to the Municipal Government

Mr. Fang Zhichao, the current president of the Dazhong Evening News, was originally the Director of the Administrative Office when Commander Xuan Tiewu was the Director of the Municipal Police Bureau. For the past two years, he has made many contributions to police administration. In the summer, in order to participate in the election of legislative members, he resigned from his official position according to law, presided over the Dazhong Evening News, and managed the voluntary police affairs. Currently, the number of voluntary police in the city has expanded to more than 15,000, assisting professional police in promoting government laws and regulations, and their contribution is great. Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Director Yu are extremely concerned. Mayor Wu also hired Mr. Fang as a consultant for consultation at any time.

### Suburban Cars Illegally Carry Passengers Authorities Are Discussing Elimination Measures

Suburban long-distance bus companies and municipal public transportation companies have petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to ban the illegal carrying of passengers by many buses, which hinders their business. The bureau believes that illegal passengers mostly have agencies and organizations as their background, so it is quite difficult to deal with. The police bureau and other agencies are currently discussing elimination measures. In addition, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works believes that soldiers often do not buy tickets when taking buses, and it is estimated that the ticket revenue of various transportation companies is reduced by at least one-third. In order to take into account the business of various companies and maintain expenses, the bureau is currently drafting preferential measures for soldiers to take buses, which will be implemented in the near future.

### A Tour of the Sinan Road Detention Center More People Than Lunch Boxes Eating Becomes a Big Problem Most Prisoners Get By on Matchboxes

[Our Newspaper] The reporter visited the Sinan Road Detention Center the day before yesterday, and the main points of the overview of the detention center are recorded below:

The detention center was originally the former French Concession Prison, completed in the third year of the Qing Dynasty Xuantong. It was changed to the Shanghai Second Special Zone Prison in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, and was changed to the puppet "Shanghai Local Court Detention Center" during the Shanghai occupation in the 31st year. It was taken over after the victory in September of the 34th year and renamed its current name. There are a total of 303 prison rooms, with 1,934 male prisoners, 447 female prisoners, 9 foreign prisoners, and 91 juvenile prisoners. According to statistics,

### Theft and Opium

are the most common. There are two meals per person per day. In months with 31 days, 17.5 liang of rice is served per day, and in months with 30 days, 18.4 liang of rice is served per day. Four liang of vegetables are served per day. Foreign prisoners receive 28 liang of bread per person per day and a bowl of foreign potato and beef soup. There is a big problem with eating. There are more than 2,000 prisoners, but only more than 600 lunch boxes, so that the food is cold for those who eat last. Foreign prisoners are treated better and have beds.

### Flush Toilet

The murderer of Yu Shengxiao, Que Li Aque, sat on his bed reading a book. Each cell had a toilet, and one prisoner was using it as a desk, hunched over it writing. Each prisoner was allowed to see family members twice a week. Most prisoners were gluing matchboxes; skilled ones could glue five hundred a day, while new prisoners could glue three hundred. Those who didn't work

### Would Be Punished

In the sewing workshop, there used to be a released skilled worker from the Hongxiang Company named He Zikui, who was detained in the detention center for indecent behavior, and he made very good clothing styles. The current inmate workers' craftsmanship is much worse. When talking about this, the current guards still miss him. Among the prisoners in the detention center, there are desperadoes, known as "Dragon Heads," who often cause trouble. Therefore, Xu Lixun and more than sixty others were transferred to Shanghai Prison. Last time, in Shanghai Prison,

### A Riot Occurred

The Dragon Heads Shi Liangen, Zhou Xinglong, and others were also transferred to the detention center. Having a new location, the "Dragon Heads'" prestige could no longer be exerted. There are rules in the detention center that women cannot enter the third iron gate, and men cannot enter the women's prison, but journalists are an exception. Minister Xie once invited a foreign monk "Father Paul" to preach in the detention center. He was a Jesuit priest and professor at Aurora University, who spoke fluent Chinese. He held a Bible in his hand and preached in front of each iron window, appearing very enthusiastic. According to him, many prisoners believe in Christianity.

Bless everyone who has committed a crime, that they may reform and be renewed, and enter heaven—Amen!

### Thief Qiu Guicheng Was Originally a Murderer; Police Academy Students File a Petition Requesting Justice for Their Brother

[Report from this newspaper] Thief Qiu Guicheng, on the 30th of last month, along with Ma Yijian and others at large, went to the home of Chou Lizhong, a squatter living at 1394 Central Road, and stole more than ten pieces of lumber, which were hidden at the home of Xu Panshi, who was aware of the situation. Chou reported the crime to the police, and Qiu was arrested and sent to the District Court, where Judge Wang Jiachuo sentenced him to seven months' imprisonment. Later, Xu Jun, a student in the Fourth Team of the Central Police Academy, learned that Qiu had previously murdered his brother, Xu Yinzhang, and yesterday submitted a petition to the District Court requesting a separate investigation and prosecution. The petition stated in brief: Qiu once served as the head of the Third Regiment of the puppet "Military Affairs Commission Special Envoy Office" in 1942, colluding with Japanese Major General Fubu, leading tens of thousands of enemy and puppet troops, and routing the 84th Army stationed in Huaibin, Fubu, and other places. They expanded the army to clear the countryside and forced Xu Yinzhang, who served in the 84th Army, to surrender in Fengguzhen, Funing. Xu refused, arousing Qiu's anger, and Xu and his accompanying soldier, Chen Zhong, were shot dead with machine guns, and two Mauser pistols were seized. At that time, the town mayor and self-defense captain of the town witnessed the incident, which can be used as proof. Therefore, it is requested that an investigation be conducted according to law to redress the grievance and maintain the law. After receiving the petition, the District Court has handed it over to Judge Wang for handling.

### From Shanghai to Shangrao

— Tang Weibin

[Report from this newspaper, Shangrao, 20th] From Shanghai, the center of the Jiangzhe Plain, along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways, through the hilly areas of Hangzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, and Guangfeng, and reaching the marshlands of Poyang Lake, this vast and fertile natural area spanning thousands of miles, has long been brought closer to Shanghai by the construction of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The important hub of this new artery—Shangrao—once known for its military importance, is now rising to prominence as a key economic and transportation center, thus earning the nickname "Little Shanghai." The nickname "Little Shanghai" used to belong to Lanxi, but now it has been taken over by Shangrao, because the main artery between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi used to be the Guangxin River and the Qu River, but now it belongs to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Therefore, Lanxi, where the Qu and Jiang rivers converge, had to give the nickname Little Shanghai to Shangrao. This main artery suffered more damage than any other route during the Anti-Japanese War, and it was repaired more quickly than any other route in the early days of restoration. The current security along the route is also safer than the routes in North China. Therefore, although it is in the early stages of hard work, it has already shown a vigorous and enterprising atmosphere. On this clear and refreshing autumn day, the author traveled from Shanghai to Hangzhou, then to Jinhua, and then to Shangrao in Jiangxi, and then from Shangrao to Hangzhou and back to Shanghai. I would like to briefly describe my impressions as follows:

### A Day's Stay in Hangzhou

Hangzhou is the most beautiful city in China, and it is a place where the author has traveled before. I have already visited all the scenic spots and historical sites. I am only staying for one day now, and I did not intend to go out for sightseeing again. However, the official business that should be handled in Hangzhou was completed smoothly in the first half of the day, and there was still a very generous amount of time in the afternoon. The author and four other people were walking along the edge of the lake, chatting. Originally, it was just for a walk, but I did not expect that we had unknowingly reached the entrance of the Foreign Guest House, so we entered and visited. The rooms inside were clean and tidy, and the gardens and flowers were sparse and elegant. The large living room happened to be the venue for the World Young Women's Christian Association. Today was a regular holiday, so we were able to enter the venue and visit. The walls were lined with photos of the activities of various national Young Women's Christian Association groups, which were dazzling and beautiful. In particular, a specially made wooden fish was placed on the platform. It is said that the fish is knocked at the beginning and end of meetings to replace the ringing of a bell, which is very unique.

After leaving the Foreign Guest House, we continued to walk and talk. We then walked to Zhaoqing Temple. Zhaoqing Temple was built by the King of Wuyue and was known as one of the four major jungles on the lake, along with Lingyin, Jingci, and Fenglin. From the outside, Lingyin seems more solemn and majestic, but from the inside, Zhaoqing is located in a flat area on the shore of the lake, so it is more open than Lingyin, which is built on the mountainside. The temple has an ordination platform, a Thousand Buddha Pavilion, a Sutra Depository, a Dingguan Pavilion, a Guanyin Well, a Kanshan Pavilion, and a Woniu Stone, as well as many precious stone carvings embedded in the walls, which add a lot of color to the ancient temple. In front of the temple gate is the Qinglian Pond (commonly known as the Release Pond), and there is the Wanshou Bridge on the pond. The ancient trees in front of the temple are lush, and the environment is elegant. The temple buildings were only partially damaged during the occupation. In the early days of the victory, the military borrowed them to stay in. Now that the military has been transferred, the remaining houses have been borrowed by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau for the use of a labor training center. Today was a regular holiday, so we were able to go to various places to see casually. The classrooms, dormitories, and dining halls, although the equipment was very simple, were all very tidy and clean, showing a vigorous and thriving atmosphere. It is said that those who are trained here are all junior cadres recruited from examinations. There are several classes for both vehicle affairs and machine affairs. The service staff on the train have also received strict training here. The author recalled the past when he traveled on the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway under the leadership of his friend Hou Jiayuan. The service staff on all trains were attentive and polite to the passengers. Now he can infer that the service staff on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will naturally have the same service spirit. The future development of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's business depends on the personnel trained in this batch.

### From Hangzhou to Jinhua

The author arrived at Hangzhou City Station in the morning and took the special express train to Jinhua at 7:10 AM. He arrived on time at 1:39 PM. This section is only 185 kilometers long, which is slightly shorter than the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, but the travel time is 6 and a half hours. On the surface, it seems a bit slow, but in fact, the railway bureau has done its best, because this was originally a very difficult task. This section of the road is not like the plain of the Beijing-Shanghai Road, but a hilly area with larger slopes and curves, which is not up to the standard of a first-class line. During the Anti-Japanese War, the damage was quite serious. The section between Hangzhou and Zhuji was hastily repaired by the Japanese after the damage. The bridges between Zhuji and Jinhua were almost completely destroyed, and nine-tenths of the station buildings at each station were also destroyed. As for the tracks, power lines, machine rooms, and water supply stations, they were completely dismantled, and only the roadbed was roughly preserved. With such severe damage, it is naturally not easy to repair and open to traffic in a short time. As for the driving aspect, the roadbed between Hangzhou and Zhuji is not very solid. For the sake of safety, the driving speed cannot be too fast. The section between Zhuji and Jinhua is the original roadbed, so the express train is faster, which is not much different from the Shanghai-Hangzhou section. However, the bridges that have been re-repaired still need to run slowly, which is safer. The author took advantage of the opportunity that the train was slower in some places and stopped at large stations for a longer time to browse the scenery along the line and observe various situations.

When the train left Hangzhou City Station, it quickly passed Nanxingqiao Station and arrived at the riverside. It then slowly passed over the Qiantang River Bridge. The waves of the Qiantang River and the peaks of the mountains gave people a feeling of grandeur and joy. The Liuhe Pagoda stands on the riverside, and its nearby is the Zhijiang University campus. The tall buildings and pavilions are reflected in the river, and the reflection of the morning glow and waves are mapped out, making it even more beautiful. When the car passed over the bridge, I was reminded of my old friend Mao Yisheng, who designed and built this bridge at that time. His knowledge, technology, experience, and perseverance are indeed rare in today's engineering world, which made people have the same admiration for Mr. Zhan Youtian when they took the Ping-Sui Road train through Qinglong Bridge. When passing Xiaoshan Station, the train stopped for a little longer. The author got off the train and took a look at the station casually. Xiaoshan was originally a county with a high culture, abundant products, and a wealthy place. Although it had been through a robbery, the buildings between the county seat and the townships were still very tidy. Xiang Lake, which is only three kilometers away from the station, can be seen from the slightly higher ground at the station and on the train. The station has a river that can lead to the lake. The lake is about 20 kilometers in circumference, shaped like a gourd, and is surrounded by mountains. The peaks are majestic and the scenery is very beautiful. Unfortunately, the car kept moving forward, and the shape of the lake gradually disappeared. Zhuji is the hometown of the peerless beauty Xi Shi. There are many scenic spots and historical sites here. Luoluo Village, Xilongtan, Liangfeng Cave, etc. are too far from the station to be seen. Only the landscape of Wuxie Mountain can be vaguely seen. When the train passed Suxi, the water surrounded the mountains, the clear streams were turbulent, and the scenery was picturesque. From Yiwu to Jinhua, the buckwheat in the fields was a silver flower, and the waves were rolling in the wind. The fields and hillsides were full of jujube trees and crowberry trees. After the frost, the jujube trees lost half of their leaves, which made the branches more sparse and interesting. After the frost, most of the leaves of the crowberry trees turned red, and some of them were green and yellow. The jujube trees were white and granular, like pearls inlaid on the treetops. Under the sunlight, the bright red was set off by white, yellow, green, and other colors, which was even more beautiful. Because the author enjoyed the scenery along the line, he did not feel the slightest bit of fatigue, and at the same time, he did not feel that the train was running too slowly.

### Two Days' Tour in Jinhua

The author and his party of two arrived in Jinhua at 1:39 PM on the afternoon of the first day, and left Jinhua on the direct train to Shangrao on the third day. In terms of time calculation, it was a full two days. The urban area of Jinhua and even Beishan have been visited. Jinhua had unprecedented prosperity during the Anti-Japanese War from 1940 to 1943. At that time, all the materials shipped from Shanghai to the inland were concentrated in Jinhua and then transferred to the free areas in the rear. Many people from the occupied areas in the southeast also passed through Jinhua to the inland. From only 50,000 to 60,000 people before the war, the population suddenly increased to more than 200,000. Naturally, like newly rich people, they did not know how to enjoy the sudden wealth. The military and political leaders of Zhejiang Province were also stationed in Jinhua at that time, which became the transportation, economic, military, and political center of various places in the southeast. This was the golden age in history, but soon the prosperity of Jinhua disappeared with the change of strategy. In the two years since the victory, thanks to the efforts of the local authorities, most of the destruction in Jinhua during the occupation has been repaired. The newly built municipal houses are very tidy and the streets are very clean, but the past prosperity is over. Although the train can reach Hangzhou and Shangrao, the sand beaches of Yiwu Port——Jinhua River are congested, and water transportation is not fully smooth. The transportation connecting the train and the sailboat is taken over by Lanxi. The economy and commerce have to decline day by day. At present, due to the depression of commerce, the population of the county seat is only more than 40,000, and the political expenses are stretched. The commissioner's office originally stationed in Jinhua was therefore abolished and merged into Quzhou County. The political leadership of the eastern Zhejiang region has also disappeared with it. However, Jinhua's culture has always been very high. From Xu Qian in the Southern Dynasty, Lü Zhiqian in the Song Dynasty, Song Lian in the early Ming Dynasty, to Li Qingzhao and Zheng Gangzhong in the Qing Dynasty, there are brilliant literary works left behind. At present, education is more developed. There are as many as seven secondary schools, including provincial, old metal eight county joint, county, and private schools. The site of National Yingshi University has also been determined to be located in Jinhua, coupled with the beautiful scenery of Beishan Spring, the strange rocks and caves, it is indeed a place for Zhong Yu to cultivate talents. The author spent a whole day to investigate Beishan and deeply felt that the natural wonders of the three caves of Beishan, if they can be equipped with artificial arrangement——building roads, building houses, to facilitate vehicle transportation and tourist rest, the benefits of absorbing tourism every year are enough to prosper everything; There are many caves in Beishan, and the three caves are the most famous; The so-called three caves are Zhaozhen (upper cave) Binghu (middle cave) Shuanglong (lower cave) three caves. Shuanglong Cave is a cave within a cave. Tourists have to lie in a small boat to enter the inner cave. The walls of the inner cave are full of stalactites and stalagmites, which resemble various forms; The Binghu Cave has a huge waterfall of ten zhang, suspended from the top, with rumbling thunder and flying beads, which is a wonderful sight. Zhaozhen Cave is spacious and deep, Qian Cave has Tianchi, a Line of Sky, and the branch cave has Longtan and other scenic spots. Jinhua has many scenic spots, and the detailed situation will be described in a separate article in the future.

### A Glimpse of Shangrao

The author took the train at 1:40 PM from Jinhua and arrived in Shangrao on time at 11:00 PM. The situation seen along the way on the train will be described in detail when returning to Hangzhou from Rao. The author stayed in Rao for two nights and had a full day to investigate in Shangrao. Although it was a fleeting glance, there was still a considerable understanding of Shangrao's outline.

Shangrao County is located on the north side of the Xin River. It is the former Guangxin Prefecture government seat with a circumference of nine li. There are six city gates. The south gate and the west gate are the most prosperous. The main street outside the west gate is particularly flat. Part of the west gate city wall has been demolished and opened up as a commercial place. The moat is full of lotus flowers, and willows are lined up along the moat, the scenery is very nice. Shangrao County has 2,300 square kilometers, two towns and 28 villages, 370,000 people, 780,000 mu of fields, and produces rice, ramie, summer cloth, medicine, tea, oil, turmeric, etc. Xin River has three pontoon bridges connecting the south bank. The Xinren Academy is on the high platform on the south bank, with excellent scenery, and is now the site of Shangrao Middle School, which is a great place for string and song. More than 30 kilometers northwest of the city is Lingshan, with seventy-two peaks stretching for more than 100 li. From the northeast, there is an isolated stone standing in the air, named Shiren Peak. There is a Dragon Pond on the mountain, with many strange trees and precious grasses, and crystal is also produced. There are many scenic spots, but unfortunately, the road is a bit far, and I did not have time to visit. However, looking at the peaks and stacked green in the suburbs of the city, it is enough to admire the situation.

Shangrao is currently the center of material exchange between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, which completely depends on the joint role of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Xin River's water and land transportation. The Xin River is the second largest river in Jiangxi Province after the Gan River. The Xin River was originally called the Shangrao River, commonly known as the Xin River. Guangxin Prefecture was called Xinzhou from the Tang Dynasty to the Yuan Dynasty, and the name Xin River came from this. The Xin River starts from Yushan County and flows west to Hongruizhen, entering Poyang Lake with a length of 685 li. Although the Xin River originates from Huaiyu Mountain in Yushan County, the water only becomes deep when it flows to Shangrao County, about one zhang deep, which is the best place for boats to dock. It also converges with the river from Guangfeng County south of the county seat, and then joins the river from Qianshan County eighty li west to Hekouzhen, so it is called Hekou. From here to the west, it passes through Yiyang, Guixi, Yujiang, Yugan, and other counties and reaches Hongruizhen, where it enters Poyang Lake. The places passed by the Xin River are the rich places in Jiangxi Province. At present, the goods such as rice, tea, and tobacco leaves in these places are all collected in Shangrao and shipped to Hangzhou, Shanghai, and other places via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The salt, cloth, foreign goods, and other goods that are shipped into the Xin River Basin from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places are also concentrated in Shangrao for distribution. Shangrao's current prosperity is pinned on this. In addition, Shangrao's customs are very simple and honest, and the people are very simple and honest. The most important rice, fish, meat, and vegetables in life are very cheap; the climate is also very normal, and it is a relatively wealthy and stable place in the inland. It is a pity that it is close to Guixi, and the general people are more superstitious.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Carriages

The author originally planned to go to Nanchang from Shangrao, but the originally scheduled car had some temporary obstacles, so it was decided to return to Hangzhou directly from Shangrao. He took the express train at 7:05 AM and arrived on time at 10:50 PM. It took almost 16 hours on the train. With a mileage of 388 kilometers, the express train takes such a long time, which seems a bit too slow, but with the special difficulties in fact, this achievement is not easy. The situation of the section from Hangzhou to Jinhua has been briefly described above. Now, I will briefly describe the engineering and driving conditions of the section from Raojin.

The 120 kilometers from Quzhou County to Jinhua were repaired and opened to traffic successively during and after the war. The roadbed and bridges are relatively stable. Although Jinhua to Quzhou County is only 82 kilometers, there are five major bridges in this section, including Jinhua River, Lingyu Port, Xiashan Creek, Shangshan Creek, and Dongji River. The losses were severe, and the repair project was huge. The bridges were repaired in February of this year, working day and night. The bridge abutment project was completed one after another in more than three months, but all the required steel beams had to be ordered from the United Kingdom and the United States, which was difficult to meet the emergency. It was necessary to change the plan, and the Jinhua River was the first to build a wooden arch bridge, and the Lingshan Port Dongji River was the first to build a wooden truss bridge. The old I-beams and square wood were first erected and opened to traffic in the Shangshan Creek and Xiashan Creek. When the train passed these five bridges, in order to ensure safety, it had to move slowly. The author looked down from the car window at the reconstruction project of the bridge piers and the temporary erection of the construction bridge to open to traffic, and could not help but admire the ingenious design of the bridge workers, who came up with a solution in a situation where there was no way. For this reason, it is naturally inappropriate to blame the slightly slower driving speed.

At present, the locomotives, vehicles, and all important equipment required by the railway mostly rely on foreign countries, but it is not easy to import them. Therefore, no matter in terms of driving or engineering, the difficulties of equipment are felt everywhere. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway opened to traffic in sections in advance in this extremely difficult environment. Although the passenger car that the author took this time was a low hook, lacked steel plates, and could not help but vibrate, it was made by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Factory itself. In the current difficult situation of equipment, this is another difficult thing.

The power of the current train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is not generated incidentally when the locomotive is in motion, but is generated by a diesel generator installed in another carriage. Every morning before dawn and after dusk, the train lights are as bright as day, which is convenient for passengers to read books and newspapers in the carriage. The author spent sixteen hours in the carriage this time. During the day, he enjoyed the scenery along the line, and after dusk, he read the Qingbao, so he did not feel that the time was too long.

The service staff on the train are very polite to the passengers, and the tea and water service is very attentive. The carriage is always cleaned very cleanly. The restaurant car attached to the train, although simple, is quite clean.

Based on the above points, the author admires the spirit of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway authorities in seeking progress from the difficult circumstances during the entire sixteen hours and predicts that there will be great improvements in the near future.

### False Military Officer Zhang Baozhi Re-Arrested for Fraud; Shanghai Girl You Xi Scammed Out of Two Gold Rings

[Our Newspaper Wuxi 22nd Dispatch] Zhang Binzhi, a Hunan Binqing native, 18 years old, residing in Yangximen Houjie, was previously a private in the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters. In September of this year, he impersonated a military officer, swaggered around Wuxi, and was apprehended by the North District military police, transferred to the command post, and detained for ten days before being released. However, Zhang did not repent and reform, but continued to stay in hotels, using his fraudulent techniques. Recently, he met a Miss Shen from Shanghai who was visiting Wuxi, and swindled her out of two gold rings before fleeing without a trace. On the 20th of this month, Zhang appeared at the railway station, wearing a military uniform and the plum blossom epaulettes of a major, carrying a document bearing the name of He Qi of the 17th Officer General Team of the Central Training Corps, and tried to forcibly buy a train ticket under the guise of a military officer, resulting in a quarrel with the ticket seller. He was immediately arrested by the station military police, who interrogated him. Zhang confessed to impersonating a military officer and defrauding people of property, and two original gold rings were found on him. He was handed over to the military police investigation office on the 22nd for interrogation and handling.

### Changzhou Bandits Are So Bold! They Rob, Then Sleep Soundly, Howling as They Leave

[Our Newspaper Wu Jin 21st Dispatch] In Yi District of this county, in the tea mountain area near the city wall and in the You two townships, major robberies occurred continuously on the 15th and 16th. The bandits acted as a gang, numbering up to twenty or more, and were completely unrestrained. Late at night on the 15th, a large number of bandits arrived at Yangjia Village in the tea mountain township. They spoke in dialects, wore clothing of varying lengths, and carried long and short guns. They first set up sentry posts in the village, and then broke into the homes of villagers such as Yang Hongying and Wu Gouda, looting them one by one. Chickens, rice, ducks, and clothes were all taken away. The bandits came and went with ease, and the entire village suffered significant losses. In Zhang Bridge Village in You township, at about 10:00 PM on the 16th, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived, carrying long and short guns, and successively robbed the homes of Xue Huisheng and others one by one, tying up five or six nearby residents. After the robbery, they drank and made merry for about two hours in a small hotel, and then slept soundly there for about two hours. They were discovered by the villagers, who beat gongs and cried for help, and the bandits howled and fled. It has been learned that this township has always been peaceful. This time, the county government concentrated and reorganized the self-defense forces and transferred them to other locations, leaving the villagers without protection and suffering losses. The public is in uproar.

### Suzhou's Winter Relief Fund Generously Donated Up to 800 Million

[Our Newspaper Suzhou 21st Dispatch] The preparatory work for the Suzhou winter relief campaign is actively underway. A relief committee was formed at noon on the 21st. The original fundraising target was 500 million yuan, but on that day, the committee members generously donated, totaling up to 800 million yuan. Another report: The Taizhou area Clearing and Suppression Command Post in this county has dispatched teams for several days. The joint office for winter defense in the four townships of Xihua, Changfeng, Shifan, and Dongzhu has been established and will launch a large-scale search and suppression operation within days.

### The Second Lesson of Democracy in Paradise

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 22nd Dispatch] The citizens of Hangzhou have already had one lesson in democracy, with the popularly elected city councilors. This National Assembly election should be the second lesson.

The National Assembly election in the Hangzhou area started with nomination contests, then moved on to central competition for candidates. In terms of area, Zhu Shaozhou was chosen but then gave up, and Li Chu Kuang, after returning as a substitute, suddenly leaped to being a directly elected candidate. This change happened only two days before the election. Furthermore, a female representative candidate, Jiang Meiying, was designated and handed over to the election office only half a day before the election. Such urgency naturally caused many places to be extraordinarily tense. In the party headquarters and election office, the people actually in charge were truly working on an empty stomach.

### Li Chu Kuang Publicly Advertises

On the 21st, before dawn, the streets were still quiet, and various shops hung out the national flag. Candidate Li Chu Kuang plastered buses with slogans saying "Please Vote." Around the Lakeside area, every pillar had "Please Vote for Li Chu Kuang" on it. On various roads, large red paper posters also read "Please Vote for Li Chu Kuang." It is said that other candidates were working hard behind the scenes. Only Li Chu Kuang was publicly advertising and campaigning, but it seemed not lively enough with just Li Chu Kuang alone. Perhaps the other candidates were saving paper, so they didn't need to advertise. On the second day, candidate Zhu Chengde, whose qualifications were signed off by the party, also put up slogans on buses, saying "Promote Democracy, We Want Open and Free Elections."

### Large Trucks Carry Voters

The most magnificent polling place was the one at the City Chamber of Commerce. Upon entering the gate, one immediately saw large gold characters on a large red silk banner saying "Please Unanimously Support Mr. Jin Runquan as a Representative to the National Assembly." Many businessmen were voting there, and they seemed very happy. The liveliest situation was at the union polling place, where groups of voters were being carried in by large trucks.

### Showing Movies to Attract Votes

The polling place of the Education Association was upstairs in its building. The director of the polling place said, "We plan to show a movie on Saturday afternoon to welcome voters from the education community to watch, but they must vote beforehand." Many area polling places were also trying their best to get voters to vote. The scene seemed quieter and the order was indeed very good compared to the City Council election. There were no disputes.

### Candidate List Mixed Up

The list of candidates revealed in many polling places had some errors. For example, candidate Chen Qiye (Qin Shi) from the industry and mining groups was listed as nominated by the central government, but Chen Qinshi was also listed as signed up. Also, in the technician category, there was one candidate nominated by the Youth Party, who was a civil engineer, but it was written that there were two nominated by the Youth Party, one named "Civil Engineering Department." In the women's polling place, several female leaders were talking at length around a long table. A polling place staff member said, "Some of them have voted and left, and some have voted and are resting."

### The Mystery of the Polling Place Slips

One polling place was located in the Ziyong Police Squadron headquarters, but because the squadron headquarters had newly papered walls, the polling place slip was posted behind the wooden sign that said "Volunteer Police Squadron Headquarters." Some people couldn't find the polling place and asked the police where it was. The police said "It's here!" The polling place staff quickly came out and turned the wooden sign around, but after not long, it became the Volunteer Police Squadron Headquarters again.

During the election process, Mayor Zhou Xiangxian discovered a person casting four votes, and immediately severely punished them. Some people were asking others to vote for "XXX" for a meal, and some were running around asking for votes, saying that if they succeeded, they would definitely repay them.

### Qualifications of Two Party Members Waver

In this paradise of Hangzhou, looking at this election, one can conclude with what the reporter heard from a person in charge of the Municipal Provisional Council in early May, which is: "Hangzhou is incomparable to Shanghai. Shanghai is lively, but Hangzhou is always calm and steady. This represents perseverance and simplicity." If we use this conclusion to explain this election in paradise, it can be said that it has made another step forward.

During the election, the Kuomintang party headquarters was particularly tense. They frequently instructed party members to give up their candidacy, otherwise they would be expelled from the party and have their qualifications revoked. As of the time this reporter was writing, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters had already requested the Central Committee to expel two people from the party.

In short, this election was of course done while learning, so everything was relatively unfamiliar, but amidst the unfamiliarity, a little bit of enthusiastic emotion could still be seen. (Special Correspondent Chu Sheng)

### Hong Kong Compatriots Suggest Renaming Roads, Removing Chinese Street

[Our Newspaper Hong Kong 21st Dispatch] The Hong Kong and Kowloon Residents Association recently made a suggestion to the Hong Kong government to add street names to house numbers. This is an epoch-making reform. The Hong Kong government has adopted it and started implementing it. In the future, people from mainland China will find friends much more easily than before. The Residents Association, with the reason of "enhancing Sino-British friendship," also plans to suggest to the Hong Kong government to rename some roads in Hong Kong and Kowloon after famous Chinese people. This suggestion does not seem easy to implement, at least not at this stage. Streets in Hong Kong and Kowloon are named after provinces of China, and some are named after major cities of China, but none are named after famous Chinese people. However, except for one "Shanghai Street," streets named after Chinese provinces and cities are either in remote corners or are short and narrow, far behind the so-called "Queen's Road," "Des Voeux Road," "Nathan Road," and "Prince Edward Road"! In the bustling Central district of Hong Kong, there is a "Chinese Street," called Chinese St. in English, which translates to "Chinatown." This street is the narrowest (cars cannot drive on it), dirtiest (there is a ditch in the middle), and oldest street among the streets for sale in Central. But for some reason, the Hong Kong government's "official translation" calls it "Chinese Street." Compatriots in Hong Kong unanimously say that this street should not be given this name and should be removed. (Special Correspondent Yu Jian)

### Yongchuan and Neijiang Sections of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to Start Construction Soon

[Our Newspaper Chongqing 20th Dispatch] The bidding for the earthwork engineering of the Yongchuan and Neijiang sections of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was held a few days ago, and construction will start soon. French engineer M. Feyaux told our reporter: "The engineering progress of this road is extremely fast. If the Sino-French agreement is successfully signed and French equipment is continuously supplied, the Chongqing-Neijiang section can be built quickly." However, it is not known when the signing procedure can be completed, and the Sino-French authorities are likely not as well-informed, and there has been no news of the Shaban Bank Group coming to China for a third time.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau Explains Increase in Use of Civilian Land

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 22nd Dispatch] Regarding the case where all sectors of Zhuji accused the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Engineering Office of colluding with city monks to seize civilian land, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau now explains as follows: The railway is actively carrying out double-track engineering, and many stations have facilities that need to be improved. Previously, because transportation at Zhuji Station was frequent, the original freight line in the station was too short, and the storage area for goods was also insufficient. Therefore, it was approved by the Bureau Affairs Council to extend the original freight line to Qinglonggeng, and the Hangzhou-Ji Engineering Section was ordered to survey and report on the matter before legally carrying out the requisition. The statement that it was at the request of a certain merchant is a misunderstanding. Moreover, the county government of Zhu had been informed that the increase in land use required for the project to extend the freight line and other projects should convene the owners to discuss the matter through the town government of the inner city, and this matter is currently being requested from the county government of Zhu to quickly stipulate the land price in accordance with the law, so as to complete the requisition procedure as soon as possible.

Cai was furious and declared that he wanted to accuse Wu Shigen of being a Communist suspect, and threw back the previously received rice money. At this point, Wu was filled with worry and hanged himself to death. This case is currently being thoroughly investigated before being reviewed and handled.

### A Child Education Problem: How to Stop Children from Crying

— Chen Heqin

Today's topic is "How to Stop Children from Crying."

Children are different from adults. When children are happy, they laugh innocently, and when things don't go their way, they cry loudly. However, crying too much is annoying to adults and detrimental to the children themselves. Now, we want to explore why children cry so often and what methods we can use to stop them from crying.

Philosophers have two views on children's crying. One view is that children's crying is beautiful and even like heavenly music. Another view is that children's crying is a protest, a cry against this wicked world; Rousseau once said so. Let's put these aside. From a physiological perspective, crying is a natural phenomenon for children. For example, when a child is in the womb, the lungs are flat and not yet functioning for breathing. Once born, the child must cry to expand the lungs. Therefore, at this time, a child's crying is a critical factor in determining survival.

After this, children still have a close relationship with crying, because if they don't cry, their lives are still in danger. But the question is, why do children need to cry? What causes them to cry? Based on my experience, I believe that children cry for seven physiological reasons:

The first reason is "hunger." Children will cry when they are hungry; if they don't cry, they cannot survive. Crying is their only weapon. To stop children from crying, we must feed them on time.

The second reason is "pain." Children will also cry if they bump their bodies or are hurt by something else. Regarding this point, parents should pay more attention and protect and inspect them at all times.

The two reasons mentioned above are generally known. I won't go into detail. The following five reasons may not be known to everyone, so I will specifically raise them for your reference.

The third reason is "thirst." I once saw a four-year-old child who was so thin that he was almost unrecognizable and cried all day long. I often found it strange, so I asked his mother and observed his life. Oh! It turned out that this child had never drunk boiled water since birth. We must know that children, like adults, also need to drink water. Although breast milk contains water, it is very little. Therefore, we should give them boiled water every two feedings, and morning and evening are also essential. Crying because of thirst and not getting water is also common.

The fourth reason is "cold." Children will also cry when they are cold. Parents should pay attention at all times and add clothes for them as needed.

The fifth reason is "heat." Children will also cry when they are hot. However, this "experience" comes from my own child. Once, we moved, and I held my child in the car. Because it was summer and the sun was strong, I used an umbrella to shield him. However, he kept crying all the way. I wondered, he didn't cry when he rode in the car before, what was the reason? But as soon as we got home, he stopped crying. It turned out that children are also afraid of heat and strong sunlight. Later, I tested it several times, and it proved the reason for this crying.

### Departing Army Loses Footing, Malaysia Defeated by China United: 4-2 Performance Tense and Exciting, Charity Match with Huge Crowds

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Malayan Chinese United Football Team, on the eve of their departure, played a farewell match at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday against the China United Team, which was a combination of Donghua Qing and Bai teams from this city. Fans, impressed by the skills of the Malaysian Chinese team, flocked to the event as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The honorary seats, special seats, and regular seats were all sold out, with crowds of people packed tightly, estimated to be around 20,000. When a goal was scored, the sound of firecrackers resounded through the sky, marking a rare spectacle this season. The orphanage band played music to add to the excitement, and the Fourth Dimension Army, along with military police, maintained order, which was generally good.

### A Miniature of the National Games Final

After a dramatic 90-minute battle, the China United Team defeated the Malaysian Chinese team with a score of 4-2, thanks to their strategic victory. In the first half, China United scored three goals, achieving an unexpected major victory. The match was tense and exciting beyond description, crisp and fast-paced, with no moment of pause. The strength of both teams was evenly matched, making it a miniature of the Shanghai-Singapore National Games final.

### The Fatal Wounds of the Malaysian Chinese Team

The victory of the China United Team came as a surprise to many fans. In fact, the performance was particularly exciting, with the defense being much stronger than that of the Malaysian Chinese team, thwarting the Malaysian Chinese team's offense. Zhang Lingen's dead-on marking of Xie Wenliang and Mei Runhua's injury and departure were fatal wounds for the Malaysian Chinese team. The team's short stature was also a drawback. The forwards and defenders were all trapped in a situation where they could not connect. The counterattack in the second half was too late. Bad luck was also a factor. Li Yiyin missed a penalty kick, and Xia Tixian's sure shot hit the crossbar, as if it were fate. On the other hand, the defense of the China United team was excellent, and the forwards Han Longhai and Li Yao were particularly ingenious. The outcome hinged on this.

### The China United Team Filled with Vigor

The match started at 3:15 PM, with He Chunjun as the referee and Chen Jixiang and Wu Shouheng as linesmen. The China United team launched frequent attacks, threatening the Malayan Chinese team. In the second minute, Mei Runhua of the Chinese United team was injured and replaced by Lin Yinyin. At 10 minutes, Zhang Guoxing, eager to save the situation, committed a handball in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Captain Sun took the shot and scored, giving the Shanghai team the lead. Firecrackers went off and cheers erupted. Four minutes later, Longhai advanced through the middle and launched a surprise attack, catching Zhu Zhicheng off guard and sending the ball into the net. The China United team scored two goals in a row, filled with vigor. The five forwards of the Chinese United team counterattacked, but the Shanghai team's defense was tight, making it difficult to break through. At 40 minutes, Qu Yongfu violently collided with Xia Tixian in the penalty area, and Li Yiyao of the Chinese United team took the penalty kick, but missed the goal. The China United team narrowly escaped, and good fortune came again. At 44 minutes, Li Yao received a pass from Yongfu and shot from 30 yards out, hitting the net perfectly. At the end of the first half, the China United team led 3-0.

### 4-2 Final Victory

At the start of the second half, the visiting team adjusted Liu Fengchang to the right wing and Xia Tixian to his original position as center forward, unleashing their power and launching a fierce attack. At seven minutes, Xia Tixian dribbled the ball back and passed it to the forward. Hu Wenxiang shot from 35 yards out, high and fast. Bang Lun jumped to save, but the angle was slightly off, and the ball went in. 3-1, the Chinese United team pulled back a goal, and their morale soared. The China United team's hinterland was ravaged. Youliang was substituted, and Mingzhe came on the field. Both sides attacked and defended each other, but it was difficult to score. Until the 35th minute, Hu Wenxiang made a solo run and shot close to the goal, which Bang Lun failed to defend. The ball went into the net again, 3-2, one goal behind. Wu Qixiang left the field due to a foot injury and returned after about two minutes. With seven minutes left until the end of the match, Chen Mingzhe launched an attack from the periphery, breaking through three defenses. Chen Jiawan failed in his duty, and his nephew established merit. 4-2, the Chinese United team secured their final victory. Soon after, Jin Ming announced the end, and the China United team defeated the Malayan Chinese United team 4-2, avenging their defeat in Kuala Lumpur. The lineups of both sides were as follows:

China United: Zhang Banglun, Li Yichen, Wu Qixiang, Han Renbo, Qu Yongfu, Zhang Linji

Malayan Chinese United: Zhu Zhicheng, Chen Jiawan, Zhang Guoxing, Yang Jiasong, Li Yiyao, Wu Jincheng, Guan Shunde, Xie Wenliang, Mei Runhua, Xia Tixian, Hu Wenxiang, Liu Fengchang

### Self-Supplied Foreign Exchange Import Commodity Procurement Review Committee Established Today; First Meeting Convened by National Bank President Zhang

The Preparations for the Self-Supplied Foreign Exchange Import Commodity Procurement Review Committee have been generally completed, and the committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Bank of China Conference Room on the Bund at 1:00 PM this afternoon.

### Chinese Steel Rolling Mill Sends Letter to Import and Export Management Committee Requesting Direct Allocation of Import Quotas

In February of this year, taking advantage of the fact that steel rolling mills in Shanghai had not yet organized a trade association, a foreign-owned China Aluminum Rolling Mill instructed its senior Chinese staff to separately notify Yuanchang, Youlian, Lianggong, Asia, Shanghai, Gongyong, Guang, Shengye, and Xiang, and other Chinese-owned factories, to send letters to the quota allocation office of the Import and Export Management Committee requesting an increase in the China Aluminum Mill's foreign exchange quota, so that the factories could purchase more aluminum sheets from China Aluminum. The factories believed this to be true and separately sent letters to the quota allocation office requesting that the matter be handled in accordance with the instructions of China Aluminum. As a result, China Aluminum was allocated foreign exchange, accounting for 63% of the total aluminum quota, totaling over 1,600 tons of aluminum ingots for the first, second, and third quarters, with over 500 tons of aluminum ingots from the first quarter already arriving in Shanghai.

However, according to investigations, the amount of aluminum sheets that China Aluminum resold to various Chinese steel rolling mills from March to November of this year, excluding the two factories close to it, Qinchang and Huichang, was only 27 tons. Therefore, the factories that had written letters requesting an increase in China Aluminum's quota are greatly angered. In addition to organizing a trade association and requesting the quota allocation office to allocate quotas directly to each factory, they have also requested an investigation into the quantity of aluminum sheets sold by the China Aluminum factory to various Chinese factories from March to November, requesting an increase in the fourth-quarter quota for each Chinese factory and direct allocation. The Aluminum Industry Association has now forwarded all the opinions of its member factories to the Import and Export Management Committee for processing.

### Adjusting Cigarette Tax Regulations Still Under Close Study

Cigarette factories in this city believe that the cost of cigarette production is increasing daily, and what is even more concerning is that sales have not been able to expand significantly. Due to transportation obstacles in various regions and rising cigarette prices, the purchasing power of consumers with limited income is affected. Therefore, adjusting the cigarette tax is a burden that they find difficult to bear.

The other day, Section Chief Wang of the Goods Tax Department convened representatives from the cigarette industry in this city at the Goods Tax Bureau to jointly study a suitable method for adjusting the tax rate. It is understood that the cigarette industry believes that repeated adjustments to the tax rate increase the cost for the factories. However, the government's tax revenue must also be considered. Therefore, they have suggested to the authorities that in addition to a reasonable adjustment of the cigarette tax rate, other suitable methods should be studied to increase the government's tax revenue without stimulating cigarette prices and affecting sales. The method of increasing tax revenue is currently under discussion, and it may involve initiating a general increase in cigarette production.

### American Tobacco from Taiwan Arrives in Shanghai

American-grown tobacco leaves from Taiwan Province, known for their excellent quality, were previously requested by tobacco merchants in this city to be shipped to Shanghai by the Taiwanese authorities for use in domestically produced cigarettes. However, the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau stated that the production of tobacco in Taiwan Province was not abundant and was only sufficient for its own needs. Any surplus would be shipped to other provinces. However, since the Monopoly Bureau shipped 300,000 pounds of American-grown Taiwanese tobacco to Shanghai last month and sold it directly to the foreign-owned British-American Tobacco Company, the mystery of Taiwanese tobacco leaves being only sufficient for its own needs has been broken. Furthermore, recently there have been discoveries of Taiwanese tobacco leaves on the market, said to have been smuggled from Taiwan, which are about 30-40% cheaper than domestically produced tobacco leaves of the same quality.

Cigarette Prices Decline

Yesterday, the cigarette market situation was such that due to continuous shipments from various factories and tight cash positions among merchants, buying interest was weak, and speculators dumped their holdings, causing prices to decline. However, as prices fell, some people bought in, and the market slightly rebounded. As a result, a pack of ten British-American Tobacco cigarettes fell by 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, to 24.2 million yuan, and Old Knife cigarettes also fell by 350,000 yuan.

Throughout the day, except for a slight increase in packs of twenty Nanyang and fifty Small Three Cannon cigarettes, the prices of other cigarettes fell by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan per carton. The Bank Brand Nanyang Company distributed its products, resulting in heavy selling and a huge decline of 7,000 yuan.

Also reported: It is heard that after the market closed, the trend for Old Knife cigarettes in the off-market improved, and prices increased by 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan, with people buying in.

### Japanese Reparation Materials to Arrive in Shanghai by Mid-December

### Rayon Distribution to Resume Soon; Full Distribution of Three Suspended Periods; Finished Products Sell Well in India and Other Places

Regarding the rayon distribution issue, according to those in charge of the Silk Weaving Industry Association, the Social Affairs Bureau's investigation is expected to be completed soon, and distribution is expected to resume around the 27th of this month. The China Trust Bureau has suspended distribution for three periods, so all of it will be distributed during this distribution.

Recently, 2,000 cases of rayon have been shipped from Japan. The total amount of each distribution is over 200 cases, so the concentrated distribution for three periods will only total over 600 cases. There is still a lot remaining, so rayon prices are not expected to fluctuate any further in the near future.

Furthermore, our country's rayon finished products are currently selling extremely well in the Middle East, Persia, India, and other places, and are very popular among the local people. Recently, the Silk Fabric Joint Venture Company has shipped several hundred more bolts of silk fabrics to various regions. "Twenty ounces of factories," 451 pieces of machinery and equipment, departed from Yokosuka Port, Japan.

It is understood that during this discussion, details were made on the transportation of goods and the establishment of a receiving agency in Shanghai by representatives of various ministries, so that the machinery and tools could be distributed immediately after being loaded in Shanghai, without too long a delay. A detailed discussion was also held on the work of the Shanghai Wharf Warehouse. Chen Shijin, the representative of the supervision committee, is scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Japan by plane on the 26th. All exit procedures have been approved by MacArthur Headquarters and relayed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, the arrival date of the first batch of materials is not expected to be delayed, and it should arrive in Shanghai by mid-December.

### Hong Kong Weaving Industry Recovers; Cotton Yarn Supply Insufficient

[Hong Kong Airlines News] Hong Kong's weaving industry has recovered, and the supply of cotton yarn is extremely insufficient. "Official sources," "Come due to increased orders from abroad, Hong Kong's weaving industry has washed away the stagnant state of the past few months, and the need for cotton yarn has increased.

Qiu Bohui, Director of the Hong Kong Industry and Commerce Supply Office, is traveling to Dongche to discuss the issue of increasing the supply of Japanese yarn. According to the current situation, the quantity required monthly by Hong Kong is not sufficient to meet demand. The 10-count yarn required for the manufacture of cotton cloth by the Hong Kong weaving industry is very scarce on the market. As for the rumors that 3,000 bales of Shanghai yarn have arrived in Hong Kong, relevant parties say that a decision will be made in five days, and the claim that it has already arrived in Hong Kong is inaccurate.

### Japanese Paper Ring 40,000 Rolls; China Trust Bureau Scheduled to Distribute; Distribution Price 500,000 Yuan Per Roll, Lower Than Market Price

The China Trust Bureau previously obtained 85,000 rolls of "Fujikawa" brand Japanese paper rings from Japan, which were distributed to the cigarette factories in this city for application in the past two months. The second batch of 50,000 rolls is now being entrusted by the China Trust Bureau to the China Tobacco Company for distribution.

It is understood that of this period's 50,000 rolls, the cigarette factories in this city, large and small, received 40,000 rolls, and the cigarette factories in other cities received 10,000 rolls. The price of these paper rings has been approved by the China Trust Bureau, calculated at 500,000 yuan per roll, which is much cheaper than other paper rings on the market. The company is currently rushing to complete the procedures and expects to begin processing on the 26th of this month. The payment date is from the 26th to the 30th. After receiving the notice, each cigarette factory can pay at the China Trust Bureau according to the stipulated date and exchange the payment receipt for the purchase application form, then go to the Goods Tax Bureau to transfer the purchase three-part form and then to the China Company to transfer the warehouse slip and take the goods out themselves.

Although the quality of Japanese paper rings is relatively poor, at a time when paper rings are scarce, the supply to various factories is somewhat helpful. It is heard that the China Trust Bureau still has a considerable number of paper rings stored in customs warehouses. It is hoped that each factory will not abandon this period's distribution to avoid losing the right to the next period.

Spring and Autumn

### One Hundred Lines on Du Fu's Poetic History (with Commentary)

— Ding Shan

In poetry, he vows to emulate Qi and Ji,
In old age, he serves as a staff officer;
For thirty years, his brilliant verses filled the land,
Like a master gardener trimming a coral tree;
Dragon Gate's shaded ravines, layer upon layer,
The spring breeze of Liangyuan stirs mist and haze;
Among the elders, he befriended the two Lis,
Returning to Penglai, he composed three Rhapsodies.

(Note) Du Fu often compared himself to Qi and Ji, which some considered excessive. However, considering that he stands tall as the sage of a thousand years of poetry, comparing himself to Qi and Ji is a humble expression. The Duke left the Gorge in 766 AD and drifted to Jingchu; he died in 770 AD. There is a poem that says, "A guest in Hunan, moved by the spring, swallows still return to seek their master," hence this passage is written in mourning for him. The Duke's poems began in the Kaiyuan Tianbao era and ended in the fifth year of Dali, spanning about twenty-nine years. He wrote 1,141 poems, excluding the falsely attributed poems "To the Day of the Winter Solstice, Poem 2," "Watching the River Rise at the Bazhou Pavilion, Poem 2," and "Escape from Difficulties," totaling three poems. Four poems found in other collections, "Lamenting Vice Minister Changsun," "Wailing the Lady of Guo," "Drunken Words in the Army," and "Cuckoo Song," are also excluded, leaving a total of 1,134 poems. He attended banquets with Li Bai at the Lixia Pavilion, accompanied by Li Bei Hai, both of whom were older than Du Fu. In the tenth year of Tianbao, the Duke first arrived in the capital and presented three great ceremonial rhapsodies. Historical records all state that this was in the thirteenth year. According to the Imperial Records, the Three Great Rites were performed after ten victories. Du's memorial also says, "I grew up in Your Majesty's simple customs and have lived for forty years. Therefore, I know it must have been in that year."

Phoenix carriage, feathers woven into emerald green,
Officials and ministers, their faces moved in admiration;
Immortal officials displeased with the emperor by his side,
He was sent as a Commandant to Hexi, then as a staff officer;
Back and forth, a guest of Baishui and Fuzhou,
Gazing at the majestic Mount Yun, facing the main road;
The sound of the Yuyang drums unheard,
In tattered clothes, he hurried to the emperor's location.

(Note) The Duke was summoned to Chang'an to take the literary examination, and was placed in the selection order, but was unable to obtain an official position due to offending Li Linfu. The Tang Zhi Lin calls Li Linfu an immortal official. In the fourteenth year of Tianbao, he was offered the position of Commandant of Hexi, which he declined, and was instead appointed as a staff officer in the Right Guards. Because his family was in Fengxian, he went to Fengxian in November. He headed north and wrote a letter but before the letter arrived, the Duke had already escaped from the capital region. In the fifteenth year of Tianbao, in July, Emperor Suzong ascended the throne in Lingwu and changed the era name to Zhide. The Duke went from Baishui to Fuzhou, and in the autumn fled from Fuzhou to the emperor's location.

How many pipes and strings at the Jade Green Pond,
The persimmons of Guangwen were cooked and eaten;
Escaping from the rebels like a solitary dragon,
In hemp shoes, with bloody feet, he fled to Lingwu;
As a humble official, he recommended himself for the position of Reminder,
The three judicial departments did not recommend him, angering the Emperor;
He halted his horse at the Meridian Gate, leaving the capital,
From then on, tall buildings were delayed in the vast wilderness.

(Note) When the Duke went north and was trapped in the rebel's lair, Wang Wei and Zheng Qian were both disgraced, but the Duke alone escaped and went to Fengxiang to meet the Emperor, and was appointed Left Reminder. Because the Duke spoke in defense of Fang Guan, the Emperor was angered and ordered the three judicial departments to interrogate him; Prime Minister Zhang Hao saved him from being punished, and he was allowed to return to Fuzhou. In June of the first year of Qianyuan, because of Fang Guan's affair, he was appointed as the Sima of Huazhou. In the spring of the second year, Guanzhong was in chaos, and he abandoned his official position and went west, crossing the Long Mountains, and becoming a guest in Qinzhou. From then on, he traveled the difficult paths of Qin and Shu, and was forced to go to Jingchu, never returning to the capital.

The livelihood in Qinzhou was full of sorrow,
Driven by hunger, he traveled to Guanzhong;
Going west into Shu endlessly,
The sky in Shu is often gloomy, the nights long and rainy;
He chose a site for his thatched cottage in the western branch village,
All because he had no money, regretting saving on axes.

(Note) In the second year of Qianyuan, the Duke was a guest in Qinzhou, and wrote the Twenty Miscellaneous Poems, and the Three Officials and Three Separations all on the way. This was the initial stage of Du Fu's poetry transcending the ordinary and entering the realm of the sacred. The Duke's construction of his thatched cottage did not begin in Chengdu. He initially sought land in Qinzhou, in the western branch village west of Chigu, loving its proximity to the Zanshang monk's cloud room, but ultimately failed due to financial difficulties.

West of the Huanhua Stream,
A thatched hut, a place to dwell in this vast world,
Suddenly, this house appears before his eyes,
Two hundred-year-old nanmu pillars;
An old wife and children about to arrive,
He builds this thatched hut, enough for one acre;
He buys bamboo to the south and plants trees to the north,
The oranges of He Qiong, the fruits of Xu Qing;
Five peach trees, four pine trees,
In the third month, the hall is completed, with flowers and trees arranged.
Flying birds bring their young to roost,
He buys a boat to take his wife for a leisurely cruise on the nearby shore;
Chess is played, needlework is made, life is simple,
When guests arrive, he often worries about having no wine or dried meat.

(Note) The Duke's nanmu tree was uprooted by the wind. He said, "The old folks say it is two hundred years old, and I have built my thatched hut entirely for this." Du's thatched cottage completion included poems about seeking mian bamboo from Prefect Wei Ming, begging for peach trees from Prefect Xiao Ming, seeking dead wood from Shao Fu Zi He, and seeking fruit trees from Xu Qing. Also, the poem "Returning to the Thatched Cottage" has "The old stone is askew on the small path to the thatched cottage, and the five peach trees also cover it." The four pine poems, "When the four pines were first transplanted, they were mostly three feet tall. It has been three years since I left, and they stand as tall as people." All are the Duke's personal management. Also, the poem "Flying birds bring their young to nest, and chattering swallows often come to their new nest" indicates that the thatched cottage was completed in the third month of the first year of Qianyuan. The Duke welcomes his wife and children without a poem title, but "The old wife draws a chessboard on paper, and the young children knock needles to make fishing hooks" and "The old wife takes a small boat, leisurely watching the young children bathing in the sunny river," the joy of family life is often seen in his poems.

He has been working hard for three years,
During which he still suffers insults while seeking food,
Du is an old guest of the dukes,
Unable to fly, he thinks of Lian Po;
Wind and rain encroach year after year,
The medicine railing collapses, the thatched eaves fall;
Dark, drizzling rain from summer to autumn,
He wants to move his boat to anchor in Jingchu.

(Note) The Duke's poem "Management began in Shangyuan, and the abacus is used to calculate the years." He lived in the thatched cottage for only three years. During this time, he often went to Xinjin and Qingcheng, and occasionally went to Hanzhou to seek food. His poem to Gao Shi, "Unable to fly, what about old friends," is full of resentment. The Duke's water railing poem "The thatched eaves ride giant waves, how can they not droop" also says, "The hall suffers from sand collapse and damage to the medicine railing" all because he often left the thatched cottage to avoid the chaos, and so it came to this. In the first year of Daizong Shiying, the Duke lived in Chengdu. In July, he sent Yan Wu back to court. Before long, Xu Zhidao, the military commissioner of Xichuan, rebelled. He then entered Zizhou and returned to Chengdu in winter, welcoming his family to Zizhou and staying with Zhang Yi. In December, he went to Shehong, intending to leave Shu, and wrote a poem to Commander Zhang before going to Wu Chu.

Zheng Gong came from the west, son of an old friend,
He hesitated slightly, condescending to serve as a subordinate;
In green robes and on white horses, he says it is a matter of public duty,
At fifty years old, what is the point of wearing red?
Lilacs tangled wildly at the river's edge,
Chickens pity each other, damaging their feathers;
Is it true that one has hung up their official hat,
Pride offends customs, inevitably bringing disaster;
Xie An elegantly enjoyed climbing and gazing,
Ruan Ji knew nothing of tolerance;
A fishing rod is only suitable for living on a boat,
A lament for an old friend, three times.

(Note) In the first year of Guangde, the Duke traveled between Zi and Min, almost leaving the Gorge. Hearing that Yan Wu had been reappointed to Shu as the Duke of Lu, he rebuilt the thatched cottage. Wu appointed him as a staff counselor, inspecting the work of the Ministry of Works, and bestowed upon him a fish bag. The Duke was fifty years old. The Duke admired Li Bai all his life, but his true confidant was Yan Wu (see my book Du Fu, Li Bai, and Yan Wu). The poems he gave and exchanged during Guangde are more than ten! History says that when Wu returned to Zhen, he resented the Duke's slowness and disrespect, and wanted to kill the Duke and Zaomo, hanging their hats on hooks three times, but Yi was beaten to death, and the Duke was spared. According to this account in "Yunxi Youyi," Yi returned to court in March, and Wu arrived in the autumn. How could Yi be killed? Therefore, harming the Duke is even more absurd. It is just the words of Qi Shu Yeren. The Duke's reply to Wu's poem "Xie An did not reduce his climbing and gazing expenses, and Ruan Ji knew nothing of tolerance," shows that the two were close friends. Moreover, there are many poems praising Zhongcheng Yan as proof! In January of the first year of Yongtai, he resigned from the staff and returned to his thatched cottage. In April, Yan Wu died, and in May he left Shu to the south. From Rongzhou to Yuzhou, in June he arrived in Zhongzhou and lived there in autumn. There is a poem lamenting the return of the coffin of Yan Pushe, "A lament in the Three Gorges at dusk, his affection seen in his legacy," and the Duke never returned to the thatched cottage from then on.

He only takes the drunkard's rice wine to get drunk,
The magistrate of Zhongzhou is not friendly;
The setting sun slants over the empty mountain, the Yu Temple,
Looking north, how can he bear to bid farewell to the Latter Lord!
Turning his head, a vast expanse of cuckoos,
Chen Fu lowers his head and weeps as if诉訟;
Heaven and earth do not know Song Wang's sorrow,
Mistakenly taking the autumn mood as a resignation;
People say that old age makes poetry meticulous,
I feel that Kui Prefecture's poetry is even more bitter;
Ten thousand miles of wind and smoke, bandits are rampant,
Night after night, a lonely boat, a weeping widow,
Entering and leaving the Gorge, what is it for?
All because hunger prevents him from staying.

Cherishing a few years of thinking about a grand tour,
The old doctor pleasingly recounted his youthful life;
The landscape and figures are all sighs,
The language of heaven during the Dali era;
The gains and losses of writing are in the inch square,
His friends have withered and all have passed away;
Forcibly relying on servants to make a living,
Malaria is often inflicted by mountain demons;
Why bother clinging to life?
He follows a small boat down the Ruanpu.

(Note) The Duke's poems from Kui Prefecture are like "Chushi Biao" and "Zhengqi Ge," sharing the same heaven and earth, the same sun and moon! Those who only praise his writing for its brilliance cannot fully grasp Du. The Duke's poems from the Gorge include "Forcing himself up, relying on children and servants" and "Lying sick, recognizing mountain demons," showing his extreme sorrow. In the second year of Dali, the Duke moved to Langxi in Kui Prefecture. In January of the third year, he left Kui Prefecture, exiting the Gorge. In March, he arrived in Jiangling. In the autumn, he moved to Gong'an, and in the late winter, he went to Yuezhou, never returning to Shu.

In Hunan as a guest, through spring and summer,
Wine is difficult to pour away the bitterness of the Western Land;
A conversation, a laugh, not as he wished,
He falls into the trap of Mi Heng, sacrificing himself for Huang Zu;
Wearing artemisia, Du followed Qu Yuan,
The depths of the Zhixi Stream are not easy to cross;
Forced to drink on a good day, unable to rejoice,
One night, the constellation Ji lost its rhythm!
The Shrine of the Shu Prime Minister, the Huanhua Temple,
Sends images of purity and loftiness, alongside eternity;
Outside the Jin Guan City, when the sun sets,
Where can the old woodcutter be found for the winter sacrifice?
Poetry scrolls remain long in the world,
For ten thousand years, the thatched cottage honors Du Fu!

(Note) The Duke died in the fifth year of Dali, at the age of fifty-nine. He entered Hengzhou to avoid the rebellion of Zang Jie, and then went to Leiyang, anchoring at Fangtian Post, and died there. The thatched cottage temple in Chengdu is said to be the ruins.

### Preface to "Yangzhou to Suzhou"

— Yaojiang Bin

Talking about Travel Poems

During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, I was far away in a mountain city. Everything made me unable to forget the occupied half of our country; I especially missed the distant Jiangnan!

Since returning east, I have often traveled between the north and south of the Yangtze River for the sake of life, had the opportunity to see many phenomena of war, and also the opportunity to see many facts of glossing over the truth, but what I was interested in were not those disputes over right and wrong in the world, nor those superficial prosperities; but those desolate suburbs, dilapidated scenic spots, and the rivers and mountains after many tribulations that were ignored by people.

Whenever I have a little free time, I go to the lakes and mountains. Many pavilions and towers have really been buried by the war! Although this gives people a sense of vicissitudes, it is gratifying to be able to revisit the old places and see the remaining mountains and waters after the war. Whenever I return from a tired journey, I jot down a few notes, including eight poems. In terms of region: it includes the Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Jurong, Suzhou, and Wuxi areas; in terms of scenic spots: it is from Slender West Lake to Jinshan, to Jiaoshan; to Maoshan; all the way to Taihu Lake, to Tianping Mountain... Now compiled into a book called "Yangzhou to Suzhou", it is considered a collection of travel poems, let it leave a little trace of the mountains and rivers.

Writing about the scenic beauty of lakes and mountains with new poems is obviously an attempt. My idea is this: Poetry should have a kind of artistic conception, a kind of emotion, and a kind of rhythm. The great rivers and mountains originally have their own great and profound realm; those pine wind and water moon, those setting sun tower shadows, those pavilions, bridges, forests and gardens, are originally objects of appreciation, most rich in poetic meaning; those wind and thunder pine waves, those warbling orioles and chattering swallows, those ancient temple bells and fishermen's songs and woodcutters' chants, are simply symphonic movements of mountains and rivers and figures between heaven and earth, the most simple melody, the most natural grand chorus.

The reason why people are fond of mountains and rivers and miss scenic spots is because there are many lovely artistic conceptions in the mountains and rivers, many commendable, weeping, and immortal historical sites, a harmonious sentiment, and those strange and unrestrained inspirations of the mountains and rivers.

I am not a painter, I cannot depict those mountains and rivers and towers; I am not a musician, I cannot sing wildly between famous mountains and great rivers! In the past, although I have been to many poetic rivers and mountains and valleys, heard many ape cries and tiger roars in the mountains and fields, and also mourned those heroes and beauties who contributed to their hometowns and entrusted their feelings to the mountains and rivers; and those commendable and weeping historical dramas, those witty and humorous anecdotes, those characteristics that fully express the local beauty... Often, I was unable to grasp reality and write anything down, the time and space made my past memories more and more vague, thinking about it, it is really regrettable!

Yangzhou to Suzhou is very close, and the scope of my travels is especially limited. But this is an area of ​​clear mountains and beautiful waters north and south of the Yangtze River, it represents the beauty of oriental landscapes, has typical Jiangnan scenery; and history has left her many ancient sites, war has given her many ruthless destructions; the stories of those national heroes in ancient times, the sentiments of a generation of beauties, have spread all over the world. Recently, I am very happy to be able to take time out of my busy schedule to visit these places, but how can these poems fully describe the beauty of these rivers and mountains? How can it sing out her feelings?

Therefore, I hope to read more travelogues and poems that sing about mountains and rivers and depict customs; and I hope that one day: my footprints will go further and further, climb the mountain peaks that soar into the clouds, or go to the boundless ocean!

### The Sky of the Alps from Sunrise to Sunset

— Written by John Ruskin, Translated by Sai Lai

At dawn, when the night fog first rises from the plains, standing on some isolated mountain peaks, watching those white, lake-like layers of clouds fly over the low island-like mountain ridges, like lake water wrapping around flat, curved lake edges. There is only the influence of the clear morning, but they are even more calm and cold than the windless sea under the midnight moonlight. When the first rays of sunlight fall on the silver cloud gorges, see how the bubbles on those undulating surfaces separate and move away; and below, in the middle of those white winding river channels, the shining cities and green pastures lie like the Atlantic Ocean. Among those glittering spires, as the encircling waves break and disappear above them, the sunlight gradually shines deeper and faster. Then, the peaks and ridges of those dark mountain ranges clumsily shorten their gray shadows on the plains. …Stop for a moment, you will see that the scattered fog will soon merge again at the foot of the mountains, and then slowly rise along the winding valleys towards where you are standing, until they have become large blocks, dyed in five colors by the morning sunlight and quietly lying on the broad chest of the high mountains. Then the swollen undulating outline will gradually melt, melt, and disappear in the strong light belt, and then reappear in the tranquil sky above, losing its brilliance, like an ancient, gorgeous, fantastical dream, for no reason, as if impossibly, their original foundation disappears below in the illusory and mocking blue of the deep lake. ……Wait a moment, you will see those fog blocks pile themselves into white high towers, huge and solid, standing like fortresses along the strait, constantly rising higher into the sky, and the shadows lying diagonally on the stones will become longer and longer. Over there, in the gray-blue of the horizon, a narrow, dark and powerful spirit is forming, advancing, they will cover the sky inch by inch with their gray nets, taking away the light on the ground with a kind of convergence that makes birds stop singing and leaves stop swaying. Then you will see horizontal blocks of black shadows forming below them; at the same time, inexplicably, pale white eddies have surrounded the mountain shoulders. ——You didn't see its formation, but when you turn your head to look at the place that was clear a moment ago, there is already a cloud hanging on that cliff, like an eagle lingering over its prey. ……Then, you will hear the awakened wind suddenly rushing past, and the watchtowers made of clouds will be uprooted one by one and blown away; then the undulating, hazy rain curtain falls in the valley, with black curved tassels swaying from the clouds that have been relieved of their burden, or becoming columns of gray rain, coming and going on the lake surface, causing small bubbles on the lake surface.

Then, when the sun goes down, you can see the sudden storm rushing down from the mountains. Foaming on the wide edge, still snowy white with eerie water vapor, tattered, disappearing for a while, and gathering again. At this time, the sun, which seems to be burning only beside you like a red ball, can almost be touched, and suddenly rushes anxiously through the wind and rolling clouds that come and go and falls down, as if it will dye the entire sky red with its blood, and will never rise again: then you will hear the gradually disappearing commotion finally die completely in the emptiness of the night, and a green glow begins to shine on the eastern mountains, slowly brightening up, brightening up, until the big white moon has gradually stepped into the clouds step by step. Then it lights up the stars in the sky one by one, forming a gray, transparent flower crown like wool, illuminating the earth; they move hand in hand, foot to foot, accompanying each other step by step, as if the whole sky is also rolling, and the earth is staggering below. ……Wait another hour, until the eastern sky reappears in purple, and the swollen mountains move like waves in the sea in the darkness, slowly appearing one by one in its brilliance; look at those white glacier-like curved vortices left by them when they pass through the mountains, aren't they like the all-powerful demon king and his artillery? Look at those lonely snow-capped peaks one by one, shining one after another below, isn't each one a new clear morning? Look, their long ice mountains collapse with light brighter than lightning, sending every broken snowflake into the sky like smoke from an altar; the rose-colored light of the calm dome shines upwards beside them, placing new light through the rising clouds with a purer light, until the entire sky, a red canopy, has been woven with a roof of undulating flames, and then trembling, jumping one after another, as if the wings spread by countless groups of angels. Then, when you have seen enough and are exhausted, when you have succumbed to the love and terror of this God of Creation, please tell me who brought this "divine" message to the world!

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

So you risked your life to find the original copy, didn't you? Then, you will be disappointed again and again. What's the reason? To tell you the truth, our "secret codes" etc. do not have a so-called "original copy".

Of course, those daily notes in our notebooks, sunny or rainy days, etc., are extremely important secret messages. If there is no original copy, even if we always remember them, wouldn't we even forget them ourselves after a long time?

That's not true either. You probably still remember Tsurumi's invention of a simple secret code? He does have expertise in this type of work. The way we record things in our notebooks is also based on his secret code, with slight modifications. His secret lies in mechanical changes, combined with organic changes. Mechanical changes are a fixed method, requiring no great memory, like the "multiplication table" in arithmetic, once memorized, it can be applied forever. Organic changes, however, require a slight reliance on memory, but because they are interspersed with mechanical fixed methods, and the organic changes are controlled by mechanical rules, as long as the ability to deduce is strong, they can be explained, and no great memory is required.

Therefore, we members of the grain association understand the things recorded in our own notebooks very well. At a glance, we know that a certain item refers to tea matters, and it is not easy for even one in ten thousand errors to occur. Not only that, we all understand each other's secret codes; this is because the methods we use are all a system.

As for how to create this mechanical-organic fusion method, it is not easy to explain at once. I will give you an example, and you may understand it at a glance. For example, Tsurumi's record about "July 31st, riding the seaplane 'Pioneer', being summoned back to Tokyo, being closely monitored by two military adjutants, and losing freedom of action, like a criminal:" In his notebook, it is:

"Cloudy, two friends strongly invited me to go swimming in the sea, I could not refuse." Based on the facts already written, you have probably realized how this method is formed. The rest that needs to be interpreted are the points "Tokyo trip", "seaplane", and "Pioneer". But it is extremely simple: "Tokyo trip" is hidden in the word "sea"; because according to Tsurumi's departure point on that day was in China, only the east is the sea; in other words, the word sea indicates the direction of travel, and the "east" in the direction clearly indicates the destination "Tokyo".

As for the representative term for "seaplane", it is the word "bathing", which is our original mechanical term, but also contains organic changes, which can be inferred in detail. If it is a land plane, the terms we use include "riding a horse", "driving a car", "rice ball", "dagger", "automatic pen", etc. The term "Pioneer" is implied in the shape of the word "to"; at the same time, in the old Japanese military song, there is a familiar line, "Brave warriors lead the way to the enemy's territory, lead the way to the enemy's territory..." Therefore, seeing the word "to" easily brings to mind the words "Pioneer".

Regarding aircraft names, as well as various fleets, unit numbers, guns, artillery, bombs, military supplies, etc., there is one more thing that must be stated, that is, we who select these types of workers must have extensive collection, and in advance, must draw each of these things, and set a technical name or nickname for each, some are "category names", some are "special names", just like friends in the underworld use afterwords, allusions, pictograms, etc., to create many "slang" and "technical terms".

In addition, Tsurumi did not especially emphasize the aircraft name in that one entry, but just casually recorded it; whether it is definitely "Pioneer" is not very important. In case this aircraft name is particularly important, his record will have a special way to express the name.

"Damn it, Bazis..." Tsurumi was somewhat surprised when he saw me use this Northeast curse on him. After a chuckle, he paused for a moment, but unexpectedly came up with another one, as if deliberately trying to make me laugh.

"What's going on, old Tsurumi?" I asked intentionally or unintentionally; of course, I was asking about his strange language.

### Plastics and Modern Civilization

— Meng Kun

The progress of human culture is often categorized by the materials used in their material lives. Thus, historians have distinguished the Paleolithic Age, the Neolithic Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. These ages span tens of thousands of years and only employed natural materials; humans could not create new objects themselves. Since the advent of celluloid, glass, bakelite, alloys, as well as artificial silk, artificial rubber, and artificial ivory, humankind has learned to use scientific methods to manufacture materials with new properties, suitable for specific tools. Finally, plastics were invented. The diversity of plastics in various performances exceeds all previously manufactured synthetic products, almost able to be matched to any need according to human desires. In this way, the human lifestyle has been greatly improved, surpassing previous generations. Therefore, some call the era we live in "the Age of Plastics," signifying its progressive significance over the Iron Age and others.

The invention of plastics, strictly speaking, dates back about a hundred years, but its actual practical application has only been in the last decade. The invention process of plastics, as well as other specific publications, have already been introduced in considerable detail, so there is no need to repeat them here.

We commonly refer to plastics as "glass," which is incorrect. Moreover, simply speaking of "glass" only points to a certain type of plastic, failing to encompass the "versatility" of plastics. Plastic is a category, a general name, encompassing hundreds and thousands of different materials with different properties, catering to various needs. Its properties vary from place to place. It can mimic almost any property that other materials possess. Therefore, in the future world, plastics will undoubtedly replace all raw materials and become the sole material source for human life.

It can have various properties. Generally speaking, it can have different degrees of hardness, ductility, strength, or softness. It can be lubricating, colored, patterned, fireproof, or flammable. It can be rustproof, salt-resistant, and acid-resistant. It can be moisture-resistant and temperature-resistant. It can be very light and clean. It can be heat-resistant and impact-resistant. It can be transparent and electrically insulating. It can be elastic and reflective. It is odorless, does not shrink or crack, and is easy to and possesses other properties. In fact, possessing these properties is equivalent to possessing all properties. Therefore, materials like metal, wood, rubber, ceramics, miscellaneous, paper, alloys, and glass will only be replaced sooner or later. The future of human life is bound to rely on plastics.

To date, the relationship between plastics and humans is quite close. No one can completely reject or resist its allure. Many things that used to be made from other materials are now made from plastics, which are not too expensive and extremely convenient. Here, let us mention some plastic products that have already achieved considerable success in human life.

1.  Housing. We often hear terms like mobile homes, which are often made entirely of plastics. Even in older houses and other buildings, the application of plastics is gradually expanding. It can replace steel frames as various structures, and it can replace cement and wood as walls, doors, windows, and accessories. It can replace glass, floors, and screens, often made of plastics. Coatings and paints also use another type of plastic. Stairs, roofs, curtains, bathtubs, etc., are also the same. In addition, there are furniture, electric lights, telephones, electric stoves, and other various items.

2.  Clothing. Plastics can replace wool and other fabrics. From spring wear, summer wear, to winter wear, all kinds of clothing can use plastics as raw materials. Raincoats and overcoats can be made. Most buttons are now made of plastics. Shoe heels, shoe uppers, purses, and suitcases can all use plastics. In addition, besides ties, artificial flowers, and certain ornaments that can be made from plastics, even accessories such as pens, cigarette holders, lighters, hair clips, glasses, and watchbands that are carried around are mostly made of plastics. Of course, hats, felt blankets, gloves, socks, shawls, suspenders, and underwear, shirts, and bathrobes made of plastics are also commonly seen.

3.  Transportation. By the year the Great War ended, there were already airplanes and cars made of plastics, but not entirely; they were limited to the walls, covers, wheels, and other parts. Now there are plastic cables, yachts, and bicycles. In terms of parts, its application is even wider, such as light regulators, transparent glass, inlays, roadbeds, switches, and signal lights.

4.  Hygiene. In medicine, plastics were first used in instruments and appliances, such as instrument racks, bottles, masks, mirrors, artificial human models, and other surgical instruments. In addition, sutures and dentures for dental use, as well as prosthetic legs, are also made of plastics.

5.  Entertainment. Almost all sports equipment can be made of plastics. Photographic equipment and its parts are also the same. There are plastic yachts, fishing gear, and radios. Records and movie screens, etc. Many children's toys are made of plastics. Gambling supplies, such as playing cards, mahjong, and dice, also often use it. Musical instruments, from the piano keys, can all be made of plastics.

6.  Other aspects. In publishing, plastics first replaced lead type and can also be used as raw materials for printing plates. Both heavy industry and light industry use it extensively. The caps on food products have recently been made of plastics. Chemical machinery is most suitable made with plastics. In addition, typewriters, fire sprinklers, urban water pipes, art models, radios, etc., also use it extensively. Moreover, even war is inevitably related to plastics, but this is not a symbol of human happiness.

### Talking About Electrons

— Xiu Wu

All things in the universe, in various forms and colors, from distant suns, moons, and stars to nearby pavilions and towers, from the stillness of green hills and clear waters to the movement of flying birds and running animals, though diverse in form and different in nature, are all, in the eyes of physicists, called matter.

It is universally recognized by physicists that all matter is composed of molecules. The molecules that constitute matter in the universe have different properties but are exactly the same in size. Under the same temperature, pressure, and volume, the number of molecules contained is uniformly equal. For example, air at normal temperature and pressure contains 27×10-18 molecules in a cubic centimeter of volume. If we densely arrange the air molecules in this cubic centimeter, the length of this row could encircle the Earth's equator 200 times. The size of this number is truly astonishing.

However, molecules are composed of atoms. Forty years ago, scientists universally recognized atoms as the smallest unit of matter. It was not until 1895 that J.J. Thomson proved that atoms were not the smallest unit and that electrons were the smallest unit of matter. Moreover, the number of different types of matter in the universe is countless, and there are ninety-two kinds of atoms, but all electrons are the same, without any difference. Therefore, matter originates from one kind of electron, which creates ninety-two kinds of atoms, and these ninety-two kinds of atoms combine into countless molecules, which then bind together to form all things in the universe. Matter.

Things seem like a grain of millet in the vast ocean, and the numbers are so astounding that they defy description. Let's consider the three aspects of electrons: "charge," "diameter," and "mass."

The charge of each electron is 1.50×10-19 Coulombs. To make readers understand how incredibly small this number is, let's say there is a 100-watt light bulb. The number of electrons passing through it in one hour is as many as 22680×10-18. The largeness of this number indicates how small the charge of an electron is. Let's make an analogy. Suppose an ordinary person can count one hundred times per minute, with sixty minutes in an hour, twenty-four hours in a day (without sleeping all night), and three hundred and sixty-five days a year (without resting for a day). He can count about 53 million electrons per year. If we mobilize all 460 million people in China (men, women, old, and young) to do this electron counting work, it would take a million years to count the number of electrons needed to light a 100-watt light bulb for one hour. But history tells us that from the time of Emperor Yao to the present, there have only been over four thousand years!

Looking at the diameter of the electron, it is 2×10-13 cm. It would take 500 million million electrons lined up to make one centimeter.

The mass of an electron is 9×10-28 grams. It would take 11000000000000000000000000000 electrons to make one gram. We know that one thousand grams is one kilogram. The lightness of this electron is truly indescribable. The intelligent reader should be able to understand this twenty-eight-digit number.

### London Fog

— Ge Ming

Fog is actually just clouds at ground level. We don't fully understand how it forms, so it's difficult to predict its occurrence with certainty. Sea fog often appears in the summer—June is the worst month in the English Channel, which is one reason why the United States and Britain deliberately chose that time for the Normandy landings in France—but on land, fog is a mid-winter phenomenon. These are foggy days in London, averaging rarely more than twenty days a year. But there were a total of eighty-six days in 1886; and only thirteen days in 1900, which was an exception.

Careful comparison of urban and rural conditions suggests that urban fog is not caused by coal smoke—these only make it denser. But sulfuric acid in urban air, like salt in the sea, promotes the condensation of water vapor into fine droplets.

The water droplets in fog are only about one-millionth of an inch in diameter—the coal smoke particles contained within are even smaller. If you walk in London fog for an hour, you will inhale 140,000 coal smoke particles. In Manchester, this number would increase by about 50%. Five days of fog in Glasgow weigh 1,300 tons and can generate 7,000 kilowatts of electricity.

### A History of Microscopes

— Pan Chenglie

Tracing the history of the microscope is somewhat difficult. The first to create a convex lens and a single microscope was likely Roger Bacon in the 13th century. The first microscope was made with a single lens. We know little of the history after that until the 17th century, when a Dutchman named Anton van Leeuwenhoek began grinding lenses and making glass capable of magnifying objects in his spare time. Later, he became famous, so much so that many travelers to the Netherlands regarded seeing his microscope as a major event. At that time, Leeuwenhoek did not have a definite research plan, merely pointing the microscope at whatever was at hand. He examined his own blood and discovered its red cell composition. He also studied spiders, ants, eggs, bees, and other small insects. One day, he examined the tartar in his teeth and was amazed to find many small dots and rods. But this important discovery was not valued. He was the first to see bacteria—those tiny organisms that affect health and disease. But Leeuwenhoek did not realize the importance of his invention. In fact, it was not known until two hundred years later.

Another Dutchman named Jansen, while working in his father's eyewear store, discovered that placing two lenses in a tube could clearly see distant objects. This news spread to Italy, and the astronomer Galileo, upon learning of this, began designing an instrument that could observe celestial bodies. As a result, his telescope made objects appear a thousand times larger and thirty times closer than seen with the naked eye.

These instruments gradually developed, and things that were initially invisible to the instrument can now be seen clearly. Microscopes and telescopes have opened up an invisible world for us. It is said that the naked eye can only see three thousand stars, but Galileo's telescope allows one to see a million. The large telescope on Mount Wilson can photograph nearly two hundred million. There are many reasons to believe that if we invent a telescope with even stronger magnification, we can see that the Milky Way is composed of trillions of stars. But there is not yet a telescope that can prove this.

The microscope is now the most useful tool for doctors. With it, he learns a lot about the structure and function of the body.

For example, the microscope tells us that every organ and tissue in the body is based on cells. We can see these cells and study them. The cells in different organs of the body are different, so the microscopic observation of tissues indicates which organ they come from. At the same time, their functions also have great practical value. Suppose someone has a tumor in their chest. Doctors often cannot tell whether surgery is necessary based on feeling alone. He then consults a pathologist. While the patient is still under anesthesia, he quickly takes a piece of this tissue to examine it. The microscope will tell him whether it is cancer or not.

Using a microscope, we can count red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, thereby knowing whether there is blood deficiency or other diseases. The normal number of red blood cells is about five million per cubic millimeter, and white blood cells are seven thousand five hundred. These are quite important. Many diseases can increase white blood cells, such as pneumonia and appendicitis. In addition, there are also many diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis, where the blood cell count is either normal or reduced.

Similarly, the microscope is of valuable help in studying various endocrine secretions in the body, as well as in mycology and sponge tumors. It can also be used to distinguish different parasites. We find it strange how doctors could carry out their work a hundred years ago without it.

The microscope allows people to see things clearly and observe what has never been seen before, realizing that the world is so vast that there is nothing that is not there. Its contribution to science is truly immeasurable.

### Arctic Temperature Increase

— Liu Dade

Everyone knows that the Arctic climate is extremely cold, but strangely, the climate there is gradually warming. According to Dr. Hans Ahlmann, a famous Swedish soil scientist, since 1900, the Arctic temperature has increased by ten degrees Fahrenheit. During the same period, the water temperature in the Arctic Ocean in the strategically important Spitsbergen area has increased by three to five degrees Fahrenheit. Since the temperature is gradually increasing, it is obvious that the glaciers will melt faster, and thus the water level will rise by one to one and a half millimeters each year. These numbers may not seem like much to ordinary people, but in the eyes of a scientist, this is truly a huge number. Although the phenomenon of climate change has been discovered in recent years, its underlying causes remain unexplained. Of course, we can also assume that this is one of the characteristics of the Earth. But no matter what the reason, Ahlmann believes that this phenomenon is causing a serious international problem. Let us imagine that if the frozen areas of Antarctica and the massive icebergs of Greenland also melt at the same rate, then the ocean surface will rise and become a disaster. People living along the coast will suffer from severe flooding.

There are also examples of climate change in other parts of the world. For example, in the past fifteen to twenty years, we have known that there have been significant climate changes in tropical regions, especially in West Africa, where many small lakes have completely disappeared, and larger lakes are gradually drying up. Even the extremely large Lake Victoria has dropped by seven inches in the past decade. From these examples, we can see that the climate change in the Arctic is not impossible.

Interestingly, the climate change in the Arctic has given mankind some convenience, as it has improved navigation in the northern edges of Europe, and the Soviet Union has benefited greatly from this. In 1910, the navigation season along the west coast of Spitsbergen was only three months, but now it has increased to eight months. Therefore, in terms of world strategic importance, climate change is very beneficial.

However, the perspective of a scientist is different from that of a military strategist. Scientists, in addition to considering current interests, are also concerned about the permanent happiness of mankind. Therefore, when Ahlmann thought about the huge potential disaster that could be caused by the gradual climate change in the Arctic, he believed that the situation was extremely serious and advocated organizing an international organization on a global basis to specifically study and solve this problem.

Ahlmann is a professor of geography at Stockholm University and the director of the Swedish Geographical Society. He has conducted research work in the research room of the Department of Geography at the University of California for more than twenty years. With such rich knowledge and experience, his emphasis on raising this issue deserves our attention.
