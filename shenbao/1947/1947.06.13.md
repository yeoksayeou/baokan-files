### The Government Decides to Expedite Resolution of the Xinjiang Incident Through Diplomatic Channels; Minister Bai Is Dispatched Immediately for Handling

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] The central government has decided to send Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi as a high-ranking official to Xinjiang. On the 12th, at 8:30 AM, the Chairman summoned Mr. Bai and gave instructions on handling the issue of Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang. After meeting the Chairman, Mr. Bai originally intended to depart that afternoon, but after receiving another telegram from Xinjiang, which required further instruction from the Chairman, he decided to postpone his departure, which is now likely to occur on the 13th or 14th. Mr. Bai's flight itinerary to Xinjiang is set; after leaving Nanjing, he will first fly to Xi'an, where he will rest briefly before transferring to Lanzhou. After an overnight stay in Lanzhou, he will fly to Dihua. It is rumored that he will stay there for one or two weeks.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Defense Minister Bai Chongxi, during a temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 12th, explained the government's attitude toward the recent Xinjiang incident. Both emphasized that the government would first use diplomatic and peaceful means to seek an early resolution to the incident, while implying that the nation's territorial sovereignty would not be compromised. Bai Chongxi also reported that the authorities had telegraphed Zhang Zhizhong, the Director of the Northwest Headquarters, instructing the local garrison to fulfill its duty to defend the territory. The temporary meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 12th was convened at the suggestion of legislators such as Guang Lu, requesting that the foreign and military authorities attend the meeting to explain the truth about the Xinjiang incident. It was originally planned to have President Zhang attend, but due to other commitments, only Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and others reported. Wang's report first analyzed the internal and external situation and the recent developments, pointing out that the cause of the incident was quite complex, and to understand the truth, it was necessary to obtain accurate information first. He then reported on the government's adopted attitude, stating that the government had protested to both the Soviet and Mongolian sides. The protest to the Soviet Union concerned Soviet aircraft covering Outer Mongolian military actions, which was deemed an unfriendly act and a violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. The protest to Mongolia concerned the invasion. As of now, no response has been received. The government will deal with this matter with a calm and firm attitude, hoping to resolve it peacefully through diplomatic channels, and hopes that the legislators will trust the government. Some legislators inquired whether a complaint could be filed with the United Nations regarding this matter. Wang stated that there was no need for this at present.

The Authorities Telegraph the Garrison to Fulfill Their Duty to Defend the Territory

Bai Chongxi reported, emphasizing that the government has always treated people peacefully and that this matter can be resolved diplomatically. However, soldiers have a duty to defend the territory, and the authorities have telegraphed Zhang Zhizhong, instructing his troops to fulfill their duty to defend the territory, as the other side has put forward the slogan of "recovering lost territory," while the Altai region is indeed our country's territory. Many legislators spoke enthusiastically during the meeting, hoping that weak diplomacy would not be adopted again in the future. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

[United Press International, Nanjing, 12th] A certain member of the Legislative Yuan pointed out that the fundamental reason for the conflict between China and Outer Mongolia is that there is no boundary line at the border between China and Outer Mongolia, which is a "loophole" in diplomacy. If the boundary line is not demarcated, border disputes will continue to arise. Therefore, the government should start demarcating the boundary line with Outer Mongolia as soon as possible.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Xinjiang's position is important, and diplomatic negotiations are numerous. It is necessary to strengthen the institution and enrich the talent to cope with the situation. When the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and Legal Affairs Committees recently reviewed the "Revised Draft of the Organization Law of External Commissioners' Offices," they all agreed that Xinjiang should be reorganized into a Class A Commissioner's Office. The proposal was passed at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the morning of the 12th.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] It is rumored that Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, plans to return to his country for consultations soon, and that the embassy affairs will be handled by Counselor Fedorenko.

### Participating Councilors Concerned About the New Situation; Suggest Convening an Emergency Meeting; Shao Lizi Advocates Expressing an Attitude After Understanding the Truth

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Resident councilors of the National Political Council, such as Yin Shuxian, are concerned about the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops and believe that to protect the country's territorial integrity, the National Political Council, standing in the position of the people, should express its attitude on this matter. They have specifically suggested to the Secretariat of the National Political Council to convene a temporary meeting of the resident councilors to discuss this issue. Secretary-General Shao Lizi believes that an attitude can be expressed after understanding the truth of the matter. Yin told reporters on the evening of the 12th, "In this turbulent world situation, this incident has suddenly occurred. We sincerely hope that the government can handle it carefully to avoid affecting world peace."

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Zuo Shunsheng and Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party stated on the 12th regarding the Xinjiang incident: The Youth Party's shock at this matter is the same as the shock of all sectors of society at this matter. However, they do not intend to comment until the correct information regarding this matter arrives. They all believe that this matter must be supported by other parties, so they attach great importance to it.

Jiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. Regarding the Xinjiang issue, he only said: Before obtaining more information, he does not want to make any comments on this matter, but hopes that this matter will proceed through diplomatic channels and will not be further expanded.

### City Council and Other Groups Telegraph the Government to Protect Rights

[Report from this newspaper] The City Council, City Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, City Farmers' Association, City Fishermen's Association, City Education Association, and City Local Association of this city are all indignant at the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian cavalry. They have jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang, requesting that a serious protest be lodged with the Soviet and Mongolian authorities as soon as possible.

[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 12th] The Tianjin Provisional Council held a meeting on the 12th and decided to telegraph the government, requesting it to take effective measures to stop the Outer Mongolian troops' invasion of Xinjiang.

[Report from This City] The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters issued a telegram on the 12th, stating: Outer Mongolian cavalry, under the cover of aircraft with Soviet markings, attacked the troops stationed at Beitashan in Xinjiang, which is tantamount to a re-enactment of the "September 18th Incident." It hereby represents all party members in the city, telegraphed to the whole country, demanding that the government, on the one hand, lodge a serious protest with the invading countries through diplomatic means, and order them to withdraw their troops, apologize, and compensate for the losses; and on the other hand, quickly dispatch a large army to strictly block them to maintain the sovereignty of the territory and protect peace in the Far East.

[Another Report] Wang Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the National Diplomatic Association, made a statement on the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops, hoping that the people of the whole country would heighten their vigilance and at the same time hope that the Soviet government and people would no longer disregard the common will of the Chinese people.

(Above) In front of the Shenyang Guesthouse (formerly the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association). (Below) The large roundabout in the city center, the building is the Railway Hotel.

[Report from This Newspaper] Wu Yun, Chairman of the Industrial Association, expressed his feelings about the Xinjiang incident, saying that the Soviet Union has its own consistent policy towards Xinjiang Province, and past history can prove it. This incident gives people a sense of "September 18th" all over again. Those who insult themselves are always insulted by others. We should be deeply vigilant.

[Another Report] After learning that the Mongolian army attacked Xinjiang under the cover of Soviet aircraft, the industrial circles of this city felt very indignant. The General Labor Union is drafting a telegram to be sent to the Chairman and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, demanding a strong response to protect national rights.

Students of Guanghua University in this city were filled with grief and indignation after seeing reports that the Soviet Air Force had covered the Outer Mongolian troops in invading more than 600 li of the territory of Xinjiang Province. The school's Lixing Society convened representatives from various student groups of the school at 10:00 AM yesterday to formally establish the Guanghua University Anti-Soviet Aggression Association. Resolutions such as telegraphing the government to take strong and effective measures were passed.

### U.S. Troops Withdraw from Tianjin; First Batch Has Been Opened

[United Press International, Beiping, 12th] The first batch of U.S. Marines departed by truck on the 12th to go to Tanggu to board transport ships to return to the United States. The U.S. Marine Corps headquarters in Tianjin did not announce how many people had departed, but it is generally speculated that one-third of the 1,500 officers and soldiers of the First Division of the U.S. Marine Corps have been scheduled to completely withdraw from Tianjin within ten days. The second and third batches are scheduled to leave China by ship on the 16th and 19th of this month.

### Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Li Wenfan, Assumed Office Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Li Wenfan, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, officially assumed office at 9:00 AM on the 12th. The inauguration ceremony was very simple. First, President Ju introduced him to all colleagues, and then Li made a speech, stating: (1) After the abolition of unequal treaties, the Judicial Yuan's responsibility is even more important. (2) With the Constitution about to be implemented, the judiciary is the center of a country ruled by law, and the work of this Yuan will be even more arduous. He will follow the guidance of the President and work together with all colleagues. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM.

### Legislative Yuan Listens to Reports, Guides the Course of the Student Protests; Rejects Amendment to the Number of Legislative Yuan Occupational Representatives

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] The Legislative Yuan held its 327th regular meeting on the morning of the 12th, presided over by President Sun Jian, with more than 90 legislators in attendance. They first listened to Liu Ke's report on the nine legislators ordered to guide the course of the student protests, and Wan Dianwu, a representative of the Wuhan University petitioners, reported on the truth of the tragic incident at the school. Thirteen important proposals were discussed at the meeting, of which ten were passed. Important ones included the Organization Law of the Ministry of Health, the Amendment to the Civil Servant Retirement Law, and the Amendment to the Civil Servant Compensation Law. The Amendment to the Legislative Yuan Organization Law was resolved to be referred to the Legal Affairs Committee for further research on how to enrich the powers of the Legislative Yuan due to personnel and budget reasons.

Regarding the issue of the number of occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan, it was raised at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 12th. Because the procedure for the submission of the proposal by the National Defense Committee was not in compliance, it was resolved to return the original proposal to the National Government. After the proposal was raised in the Yuan today, Liu Ke, Chairman of the Legal Affairs Committee, first reported on the research results, stating: The Legal Affairs Committee and other committees were ordered to research whether the "Proposal for Reconsideration of the Number of Legislative Yuan Occupational Representatives" submitted by the National Defense Supreme Committee complied with the reconsideration procedure. The research results showed that the number of Legislative Yuan occupational representatives had already been announced, and the word "reconsideration" in the original text had no basis in current law. If it is a reconsideration, it is not in compliance with the procedure. Is it possible to consider it as an amendment? Then, legislators spoke, and they could be roughly divided into two factions. Lin Bin, Chen Hong, and others believed that the time for holding elections was rushed, and the main intention of the document was to increase the number of representatives, not to reconsider the entire proposal, so it could be considered as an amendment. Lu Fu, Liu Tong, Chen Ruli, and others firmly believed that it was not in compliance. Lu Fu pointed out that if the government intended to amend this proposal, it could be decided by the government itself and then submitted to the Yuan for amendment. The Legislative Yuan could not open the door for convenience. As for the delay in time, the fault lies with the government, and the Legislative Yuan cannot be responsible for it on its behalf. Luo Ding explained that if time was insufficient, an emergency meeting could be convened, which could not be a reason. Finally, the review opinion "Can it be considered an amendment?" was put to a vote. Of the 94 people present, only 24 voted in favor. The proposal was rejected, and the original proposal was returned to the National Government. Also at the meeting on the 12th, the table of allocation of the number of National Assembly representatives was discussed, and it was resolved to refer it to the Constitutional Law Committee for further organization because there were still problems with the allocation of the number of representatives in Guangxi, Sichuan, Gansu and other provinces.

### Xinjiang National Army Resists Bravely; Beitashan Has Been Recaptured; Soviet-Marked Aircraft Continue Bombing

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 12th] Our Beitashan garrison, under heavy attack by Outer Mongolian cavalry in coordination with multiple military vehicles, retreated once on the 6th after bravely resisting, and counterattacked on the morning of the 7th, recapturing Beitashan. The two sides are still in a stalemate. During the fighting in recent days, military aircraft have continued to assist the Outer Mongolian army in combat.

[Another Telegram] News from the front line of Beitashan: On the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, military aircraft with Soviet markings continued to bomb the positions of the National Army.

### The Right to Interpret the Constitution Should Belong to the Judicial Yuan

People in Judicial Circles in Beijing Express Their Views

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the right to interpret and explain the Constitution, according to Article 78 of the Constitution, it is exercised by the Judicial Yuan. The Judicial Yuan will establish a Grand Justices Conference with nine Grand Justices within days to exclusively handle the right to interpret the Constitution. However, the National Government has recently established a "Drafting Committee for the Explanation of the Constitution," which judicial circles here believe seems to conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. In the shortest period of time, an opinion will likely be published and some arguments made. Also, the Legislative Yuan expressed dissatisfaction with the National Government's organization of the Constitution Explanation Committee. It is said that when the Constitutional Law Committee recently met, it decided not to participate in this work.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Zhang Junmai of the Social Democratic Party arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. Zhang came to Beijing this time to attend the meeting of the Drafting Committee for the Explanation of the Constitution to discuss various points of the Constitution that have raised doubts and need to be resolved, and to decide on the personnel allocation of the seven groups for drafting the explanation. The meeting is about to be held. Secretary-General Lei Zhen is currently staying in Shanghai and will return to Beijing within days. Also, after Zhang Junmai arrived in Beijing, Chen Cheng, Shao Lizi, and others visited him, and Zhang also visited Vice Chairman Sun Ke and others, with whom he had meetings.

### Conducting Election Issues

Sun Ke and Zhang Junmai Confer

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Sun Ke hosted a dinner for Zhang Junmai, Wang Shijie, and others on the 12th, and had a meeting after the meal. Zhang said to reporters that the issues discussed today were mostly about the conduct of the election, and it has now been decided to hold it as scheduled. Zhang believes that the implementation of the Constitution can be realized in stages, but every article that is implemented must be genuine. Zhang believes that the Xinjiang incident should still be resolved through diplomatic channels, and Zhang is scheduled to meet with the Chairman on the 14th.

### Improving Wheat and Rice Seeds; Zuo Shunsheng Says the Ministry of Agriculture Is Researching It

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 12th] Zuo Shunsheng said on the 12th regarding the work of the Ministry of Agriculture: The only current goal is the eight characters "improve production and increase production." He also said: After the large-scale import of foreign rice, food can be guaranteed not to panic again, and grain prices will naturally tend to fall. Zuo also said: The Ministry of Agriculture is currently researching improved seeds, and it plans to research more than 20 types of improved wheat seeds and more than 30 types of rice seeds to increase production. According to not very precise statistics, before the war, China's food production offset the country's total consumption, lacking only 3%. After the war, it was only 5% or 6%. However, currently, it is only because transportation is poor and there are not enough means of transportation that there is no way to adjust whether there is any. Purchasing foreign rice is to relieve the panic when the old harvest is exhausted and the new harvest is not yet in. Now this opportunity is about to pass. Since becoming the Minister of Agriculture, Zuo has been buried in research and planning.

### The Dalian-Lushun Inspection Group Returns to Shenyang Early

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 12th] The Dalian-Lushun Inspection Group stayed in Lushun for a week. It is said that because they encountered problems that could not be resolved, they shortened their stay. They have now left Lushun and are sailing to Huludao, and may return to Shenyang on the 13th or 14th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] According to sources concerned, the news published by the Tianjin Soviet-Russian Daily on May 12 regarding the issue of Chinese administration in Dalian, which stated: The Chinese government has not yet responded to the Soviet government's request to establish the naval base area of Lushun and the administrative power of Dalian as soon as possible in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, is clearly inconsistent with the facts.

It is understood that in October of the 34th year of the Republic of China, our government planned to send troops to land in Dalian to defend the Northeast and to take over Dalian and Lushun. The other side disagreed with our side sending troops to land in Dalian. At that time, it was also reported that there were anti-government forces in the suburbs of Dalian and Lushun, so the administrative personnel sent by our side to the Dalian-Lushun area have not been able to go to establish administrative power. Regarding the letter from the Soviet Ambassador on March 7th of this year, it is understood that our side replied on March 31st of the same month. The reply stated the specific measures for our establishment of administrative power in Dalian and Lushun. After repeated negotiations with the Soviet side on this matter, the Soviet side consistently opposed our troops entering Dalian and Lushun to maintain the security and freedom of our administration. We have now sent personnel to Dalian and Lushun to inspect the situation in order to prepare for the restoration of our administrative power in the area.

### The U.S. Will Accelerate Economic Aid to China; London Pays Attention to the Invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian Troops

[United Press International, Washington, 12th] Reliable sources here believed on the 12th that if the Soviet Union's instigation of Outer Mongolian troops to invade Xinjiang can be confirmed, the United States will accelerate its economic assistance to the Chinese government. Secretary of State Marshall and other State Department officials are now planning to start this aid to promote the $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank.

[Another Telegram] Well-informed sources today do not believe that the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops has international relations, and believe that this matter is only one of the most violent examples of the recent disputes in Xinjiang. It is believed here that the alleged cover of Outer Mongolian troops by aircraft with Soviet markings is not worthy of attention, at least for the time being. Well-informed sources pointed out that the Outer Mongolian Republic has received military and other assistance from the Soviet Union since signing an agreement with the Soviet Union. Outer Mongolian troops may use aircraft from the Soviet Union since January 1946 to cover the advance of troops without directly involving the Soviet Union. It is unanimously believed here that if it can be proved that the Soviet Union is indeed related to this action, the result will inevitably be that the United States will accelerate economic aid to the Chinese central government. Secretary of State Marshall and the State Department are planning to open the Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan to China and provide the Chinese government with some economic assistance.

[Reuters, London, 11th] This correspondent's assessment of the event of Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang Province states: This is not the first time that reports of Outer Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang or using Soviet aircraft have been received. Reports of this event were also received in February of this year, but they did not escalate because the local Chinese government troops responded effectively. Observers believe that if the reports are true this time, then Outer Mongolia's goal is to separate part or all of Xinjiang from China, not to interfere in China's civil war.

### The Spasms of Shenyang (One of the Northern Travelogues)

— Bu Shaofu

In the middle of last month, the reporter was ordered by the newspaper to go to the north to inspect business, and returned to Shanghai yesterday. This trip lasted for four weeks. He stayed in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shenyang for nearly a week each. What he saw and heard during the journey were mostly fleeting glimpses. Now they will be recorded in chapters for reference by those who care about the current situation in the north.

The desolate Shenyang, lost too much blood, its pitiful state is like that.

Due to the abandonment of Changtu and Kaiyuan, the Communist army approached Tieling, causing this bleeding Shenyang to suddenly experience a spasm. On the morning of May 31, when I was about to board a military plane at the Xiyuan Airport in Beiping, a friend advised me to consider whether to make the trip.

On this day, Dong Yanping and Ye Nan of the Dalian-Lushun Inspection Group, and Shu Shicun, Deputy Commander of the New Sixth Army, flew to Shenyang. On this day, it was also the day that the Chairman left Shenyang to return to Beijing.

The scale of Beiling Airport is greater than Xiyuan. Overlooking Shenyang from the air at two thousand feet, it has some of the beauty of Beiping and even the industrial spirit that Beiping lacks. The air distance is 640 KM, a two-hour flight. When I got off the plane at Beiling Airport from Beiping to Shenyang, I saw a human Great Wall far away on the periphery of the airport, building fortifications in the sun, opening the prelude to the defense of Greater Shenyang. The authorities have mobilized 40,000 laborers to actively carry out this emergency measure.

It seems that we have to thank the past 13 years of Japanese rule in Manchukuo for its strict and serious household registration. This time, with a single order, 40,000 laborers sweated on time and on site. In the next few days, in Shenyang, I saw these toiling masses every morning, carrying dry food and iron shovels, going to the construction site in groups, and in the evening, I saw them dragging their tired bodies from the suburbs in twos and threes, wearing a cold and lonely expression.

I, this new guest, began to accept Shenyang's tension, panic, sullenness, pain, and loneliness. The sky is extremely high, with no wind or sand, and the sunshine leaves behind the lingering sweetness of spring. The air is quiet, the roads are long, straight, and wide, and the buildings are so towering and majestic, but people's feelings are not in harmony with everything in front of them.

On June 1, the garrison headquarters announced a special martial law order (later renamed "temporary martial law order"), with 11 articles. Anyone who violates them will be sentenced to death. Every day from 8:30 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, no one is allowed to pass without a special pass. On the day this order was promulgated, stores closed their doors and windows before 8:00 PM, and pedestrians and vehicles were scurrying, with a mood similar to the air raid alarm being issued in the rear during the War of Resistance. The streets became even more deserted.

On the same day, the headquarters stipulated that all distilleries in the Northeast region should stop brewing wine for one month, and the municipal government also implemented control of grain reserves, banning the sale and transportation of rice, and restaurants were also prohibited from selling rice.

In the Railway Hotel, in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in restaurants and taverns, in people's conversations, "When is your wife leaving?" "How are your family members?" "Are you leaving or not?" became necessary and popular questions. Naturally, this happened in groups going to the south, and also among a group of people with officials not too big and not too small.

The Security Commander's Headquarters was the busiest, and Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang was even busier. Commander-in-Chief Du Yuming was ill, and he could not welcome the Chairman's visit to Shenyang, and even troubled the Chairman to visit his residence in person. The four deputy commanders-in-chief were also stationed in Shenyang, and only Sun Liren flew to Changchun the day before the Chairman's visit to Shenyang. He came back two days later. The other three were Zheng Dongguo, Ma Zhanshan, and Sun Du. However, reporters often couldn't see a responsible officer for a whole day to gather military news, and even when they managed to see them with great effort, they couldn't get any specific news information. People were anxious, and reporters were even more anxious about this kind of work situation of groping in the dark.

As a result, various rumors were spreading. One of them, containing infinite hope, was: Several divisions, several divisions of the National Army, have arrived outside the port of Yingkou on American transport ships and are about to land.

The prosperity and beauty of Haruhi-cho have long passed. The many cafes and bars left by the Japanese, although a very small number (with changed owners) are still struggling, are not what they used to be under the ban on dancing. Several Northeast waitresses told me very fondly about the extravagance of the people last year, and were saddened by the situation today.

"Hey! Since these two days, even the old men who come here to listen to music and drink coffee have become fewer."

Evening parties—social dances held in large and small mansions—the Railway Hotel used to hold at least three times a week. It once attracted countless gold diggers from Shanghai to travel over mountains and seas, it once created countless love stories, and it also completed many transactions, decorating the nightlife of Shenyang. A friend told me that in Shenyang, the fashionable way for fashionable people to entertain guests is to host an evening party, and the more female dance partners there are, the more glamorous it is. One of the reasons for losing that kind of heroism is, mainly, who dares to ignore people's accusations and be lavish and carefree at this time and in this place? (The following continues on page 2)

### Beginning of the Prelude to a Major Battle Around Siping; Communist Forces' Fierce Attack Ultimately Repelled; Curfew Time Shortened in Stable Shenyang

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] The prelude to a major battle around Siping has begun. Communist forces, having once again gathered outside Siping, launched an attack from the southeast towards Siping Airport and the train station at midnight on the 11th. Heavy artillery fire filled the air, and the fighting was intense. The Nationalist forces finally repelled the attack at 3 AM this morning, and the battle has since quieted down. The urban areas of Shenyang are relatively stable, and the curfew time was shortened by one and a half hours on the 12th, now from 10 PM to 6 AM the following morning. The newly appointed Garrison Commander Peng Xuan-sheng and Deputy Commander Wang Hua-xing will officially take office within days. Many rumors are circulating in the rural areas, and villagers are alarmed several times each night. It is rumored that foreign cavalry is mixed within the Communist forces, and there are widespread rumors that Soviet troops from Dalian will use the withdrawal from Shenyang as a pretext, causing public anxiety. The headquarters stated that this is Communist propaganda to confuse and disturb the people.

[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 12th] Military News: Although the situation in the Northeast appears calm on the surface recently, an increasingly tense atmosphere is actually brewing. The Nationalist forces, from the Jilin-Changchun area to the southern Liaoning area, are not only thoroughly strengthening the defensive works and capabilities of major strongholds along the vast and extended front line but are also deploying powerful combat groups to arrange a planned and confident offensive. The actions of the Nationalist forces in the northern Liaoning area in recent days reflect a meticulous effort to capture the main force of the Communist army. Although the Chinese Changchun Railway has been damaged, the Nationalist forces still ensure the main supply lines. The southern Songhua River area is under the control of the Nationalist forces. Currently, the Communist forces are scattered within this vast encirclement, attempting to break through everywhere. The gains and losses of small strongholds are no longer relevant to the overall situation. At the same time, it can be seen that the Communist forces are scurrying wildly in different directions, north and south, to conceal the location of their main force. As the Nationalist forces have completed their deployments in various areas, a large-scale annihilation battle is expected to begin soon.

[Central News Agency Shenyang Dispatch, 12th] Director Xiong convened a meeting at 3 PM on the 11th, gathering over five hundred officers from military agencies, units, police, and section chiefs stationed in Shenyang, to give instructions and explain the current changes in the war situation. He stated that our troops have now been redeployed and will take the initiative in the future, using mobile warfare tactics to eliminate the main force of the bandit army. Finally, he advised all officers to have unwavering confidence in winning the war and to never become discouraged or disheartened.

[Another Dispatch] Communist forces that were harassing Xi Mu City were driven back on the 10th. After the Nationalist forces reoccupied the area, they continued to pursue in the direction of Xiuyan and dispatched troops to sweep towards Gaiping. Furthermore, the Nationalist forces have made a strategic withdrawal in Dandong Fengcheng, and they are now deploying strong defenses south of Qiaotou (98 kilometers from Shenyang).

[Central News Agency Changchun Dispatch, 12th] Military News: (1) On the morning of the 11th, several thousand Communist troops attacked Pinlu River from Yantongshan. The Nationalist forces bravely fought back, and the battle was extremely fierce. Subsequently, the Communist forces reinforced their troops and finally occupied the area before noon. It is reported that Korean officers and soldiers accounted for two-thirds of the Communist troops. (2) According to reports, north of the Songhua River, only Bin County currently has a Communist garrison command and troops stationed there. All other villages, large and small, are now free of Communist troops.

### The Beining Railway Attacked by Communist Forces

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 12th] In order to consolidate the Northeast war situation, the Communist forces have intensified their attacks on the Beining Railway. On the 11th, Liushouying was again fiercely attacked, and the fighting has not yet ceased. At the same time, approximately twenty li (Chinese miles) of railway tracks between Liushouying and Zhangjiazhuang were destroyed, causing traffic to be interrupted again. After emergency repairs by the railway bureau, traffic resumed in the afternoon on the 12th. Nationalist trains are successively heading to eastern Hebei to strengthen defenses.

### Sweeping Up Communist Forces in the Yimeng Mountain Area; Nationalist Forces Achieve Initial Success; Fierce Fighting Erupts Again East of Laiwu and Xintai

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 12th] After the Communist forces in the southern Shandong mountain area were cleared, the Nationalist forces' sweep of the Yimeng Mountain area achieved initial success. Furthermore, Nationalist forces in central Shandong have begun searching the mountainous areas east of Laiwu. On the 11th, they eliminated a Communist regiment at Xujiazhuang, annihilating over seven hundred Communist troops and are now continuing to expand their victories.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 12th] Nationalist forces in western Shandong launched a sweeping campaign, and at 11 AM on the 11th, they routed the 5th Independent Brigade of the Communist army, east of Juye and southwest of Dayiji, killing over two hundred Communist troops and capturing eighty-three including a battalion-level instructor.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 11th] The Communist forces, originally withdrawn to the second line of the Yimeng Mountain area for reorganization and completion of the wheat harvest, include: (1) Two columns, totaling over 40,000 men, have gathered in the area east of Xintai. (2) Three columns, totaling approximately 60,000 men, have gathered in the area east of Laiwu. A portion of them, approximately 10,000 men, continued west across the Laiwu-Xintai highway to Xinpu Mountain, and fighting with the Nationalist forces began on the evening of the 11th. (3) Another two groups, after receiving new recruits on the north bank of the Yellow River, one group of approximately two columns totaling over 40,000 men, moved through Zhangdian, Zibo, and gathered in Tusikou, Nanguodian, and the Xiaoxing area to the east, and have also made contact with the Nationalist forces; another group of one column, totaling over 20,000 men, moved from Zhangqiu through Mingshui Wenzu Town and reached the area northwest of Laiwu and near Jiuzhai. (4) In addition, over 2,000 Communist troops originally based in Xiazhang, southwest of Tai'an, also crossed the Jinpu Railway and gathered on the highway between Tai'an and Laiwu. Generally speaking, the battle for Laiwu and Xintai is expected to begin officially within days.

### Nationalist Forces in Southern Shanxi Recover Xiangning

[Central News Agency Taiyuan Dispatch, 12th] Nationalist forces from Jixian in southern Shanxi launched an attack towards Xiangning on the morning of the 11th. After a period of intense fighting, they recaptured the county seat of Xiangning.

### Convulsions in Shenyang

— Bu Shaofu

Continued from the previous page

There is an anecdote here. (Originally published in the Chinese-Soviet Daily, local edition, June 2nd)

"Someone impersonating General Zhu Qinglan's son, using the alias Zhu Huang, also known as Guo Hua, previously pretended to be a U.S. Army captain in the Northeast, swindling money and committing many evils. Later, Zhu's sixth son, Zhu Shu (currently a reporter for the Northeast Minbao), reported him with evidence. At the end of last month, he was arrested by the Commander's Office and is currently under interrogation. It is said that the person impersonating General Zhu's son can speak English and Russian and can also speak Shanghai and Cantonese. He is extremely alert. As early as 1938, he impersonated Zhu's son in Kunming and used deceptive tricks on Chairman Long Yun. Later, Cha Liangzhao proved his deception, and an arrest order was issued, but he escaped. He then defrauded a Mr. Yang in Hanoi. After the War of Resistance and after the Restoration, he impersonated a regimental commander in Hong Kong, Shijiazhuang, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places under the name of Zhu's son, deceiving many people. After arriving in the Northeast, he deceived Zang Qifang, the president of Dongda University, and was hired as a professor. He also deceived the chairman of Xing'an Province and was appointed as a councilor. He also claimed to be a U.S. Army captain and wore a U.S. Army uniform. He was arrested by the U.S. military police but was released. He then deceived Yi Guoduan, Sun Jiusi, Zhang Xueming, Ma Zhanshan, and other military and political figures. By this point, his purpose for deception was no longer just for money but included other motives. After receiving the report, the Commander's Office dispatched many officers to his residence (No. 5, Minjia Street) and arrested him. The person was in bed with a Japanese beauty. Another Japanese woman was found in another room. Secret codes and lightning rods and other suspicious items were found. His residence was extremely luxurious, with a wooden sign at the entrance reading "Zheshao Rice Apartment." He spoke with a Huguang accent and had a thin face and purple lips, suggesting an opium addiction. The Japanese woman sleeping with him was said to be the daughter of an official used by Zhang Jinghui of the puppet Manchukuo. Besides impersonating General Zhu's son, the person had no documents to prove his real name or origin, making it quite the amusing story."

The next day, the "Scenery Line" column in the Northeast Vanguard Daily had these sentences:

"Strange things happen everywhere, but Shenyang has more. There are those who impersonate Zhu Qinglan's son to swagger and deceive, and those who are deceived are all high-ranking officials. The swindler is truly superhuman."

If the author is looking at it from a positive angle, he is too narrow-minded. As far as I know, Shenyang has more than just this "Young Master Zhu." What is unsaid is worthy of our consideration.

The Xiaofengman power supply is blocked, and Shenyang's water and electricity rely on the city's two broken machines, which operate intermittently. A cement company under the Resource Committee is resuming production as quickly as possible. In April and May, it produced 10,000 tons each month, but now the machines are not running due to the lack of electricity. Speaking of electricity, there is a little story. Sun Yueqi came to Shenyang last time and stayed at the Railway Hotel at the Grand Rotary. Seeing the lights in every room of the large building across the street shining like a painting all night, he almost gnashed his teeth and said: "This is sucking my blood!" Electricity is the blood of industry. Today, the loss of blood for Northeast industry is also one of the main reasons for its stagnation.

I toured the Tiexi district for a week. The forest of factory chimneys was as silent as a ruin. The railway tracks, power transmission lines, buildings, and streets, all of this on tens of miles of land, showed the gradual progress of its creator's grand and complete plan. One rubber factory is still in operation, using up its remaining raw materials. It will stop even if it doesn't want to, but most of the others are already in a state of dormancy. After the major wounds of demolition and destruction, the Northeast industry is only left with a damaged body.

Looking at Pan Yang, thinking of the Northeast, I feel annoyed for my country! Those who work in the Northeast are particularly clear-eyed and know what the development of this situation will lead to. One newspaper called for: "In military affairs, the government should currently concentrate the nation's military forces in the Northeast; in politics, it should implement a new policy, using the political structure and policies of the puppet Manchukuo as the backbone; in economics, it should quickly restore industry. The economic barriers of the circulating currency, which is isolated from the legal tender, must be reconsidered." Whether this call is correct or not is not discussed, but it is enough to express dissatisfaction with the current situation.

Today, the Northeast problem is not a simple military problem; the interior has failed to pay close attention to the exterior, failing to encourage them positively and failing to prevent them from stealing and plundering negatively. This is what we should examine and correct. A dignified institution of higher learning can use the hiring and evaluation of professors as a game; a single sand crab can arbitrarily transfer hundreds of thousands of circulating currency; those who hold their posts, are honest and diligent, and have talent and ambition are unable to do anything or are obstructed. I don't know much, but what little I do know is enough to cause worry.

### Major Fire on the Yangtze River in Hankou, Zhenxing Wheel Destroyed

One Dead and Eight Injured Due to Careless Refueling

[Hankou, this newspaper, 12th] A major fire broke out on the river surface at the Fourth Dock in Hankou this morning. The Zhenxing Wheel of the Changhan Company, which was berthed there, has been destroyed. One oil worker in the fire hold died, and eight were injured. A tugboat of the Chu'an Company nearby was also affected, with only the hull remaining. The cause of the fire was due to carelessness when refueling the Zhenxing's fire hold.

Editorial

### Facing the Current Wage Problem

On February 17th of this year, the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was announced, stipulating that "the salaries and wages of employees in designated areas, calculated according to the cost-of-living index, should take the cost-of-living index for January of this year as the highest index." In that month, the city's cost-of-living index was 7,945 times. By May 10th, the National Economic Commission discussed the issue of workers' wages in Shanghai, revised and passed the "Interim Measures for Wage Adjustment in Shanghai," submitted by the Ministry of Social Affairs, and resolved to implement it from May. The city's worker cost-of-living index for May was announced as 23,500 times, an increase of more than two times compared to January. This caused a stir in the economic world. The employers felt that the wages were too heavy and could not afford it. They held meetings to discuss and research countermeasures and sent representatives to appeal, hoping to find a remedy. Some businesses have clearly stated that they cannot pay according to the new measures and are still paying according to the April wages. This has caused much confusion and many disputes. Their reasons are: (1) the increase is too much and they cannot afford it; (2) the social purchasing power is too weak to pass on the costs; (3) the previous orders are now subject to huge cost increases, causing unbearable losses; (4) industry and commerce are already in dire straits, and this is adding insult to injury, forcing them to collapse faster; (5) the government is suppressing prices, and it is not appropriate to raise costs and fuel inflation. The most concrete measure they have proposed is that since wage calculations are based on the pre-war basis, the increase in base salaries for workers after the war is unreasonable and should be restored to the pre-war standard to show fairness. The above arguments are reasonable and well-founded. However, the workers believe that: (1) base salaries above 30 yuan have already been discounted, so it cannot be said that they are based on the pre-war standard; (2) the crisis in industry and commerce has many factors and cannot be attributed to high wages alone; many businesses, even if wages are further discounted or workers are forced to work for free, may not be able to stand firm; (3) taking the price of rice as an example, a normal wage of 30 to 40 yuan before the war could buy four to five dan of rice, but now 700,000 to 800,000 yuan can only buy two dan; (4) some wages were indeed too low before the war and must be appropriately increased for adjustment.

Therefore, the authorities stated: (1) restoring pre-war base salaries is impossible; (2) if there are actual difficulties, they can only be resolved individually, and there is no possibility of comprehensive assistance; (3) work hours can be appropriately increased to increase production to compensate for the employers' losses; (4) before the problem is resolved, the employers should first pay a portion of the wages to maintain the workers' livelihoods, and the workers should continue to work as usual to avoid production shutdowns. During this period, employers must not close factories or stores, and workers must not strike or slow down work to increase the difficulty of the problem.

Originally, the cost-of-living index, although a good measure, is a powerful foothold for resolving disputes. But it is different from standard wages, especially from rigid legal wages. It was only at the beginning of the restoration, when labor disputes were rampant, that this statistic was introduced as a basis for negotiations. There was no intention to make it a fixed and uniform standard at the time. Therefore, after a short period of use, a Wage Review Board was established to deliberate and apply it flexibly to compensate for this shortcoming. Later, a financial institution and a public utility in the city separately compiled their own indexes and used them separately to adapt to the facts. There are even more industries and businesses that do not calculate wages according to the index. This proves that the universal application of this standard is impractical and theoretically not entirely satisfactory.

Unfortunately, price fluctuations are too severe, and wage disputes are too numerous. In the absence of any other options, this cost-of-living index has been recognized as the only standard, and habit has become nature. It is as if this index and wages are one and the same, but in reality, it is difficult to fully match, and variations are readily seen. For example, the discount payment method has already been implemented in some more difficult industries and businesses, such as the knitting industry, last year. The number of senior staff who apply this example is even greater. Therefore, the index discount cannot be regarded as the latest product. There are many cases of adding supplements to the application of the index, such as increasing base salaries, distributing goods in kind, issuing bonuses, and providing meals and accommodation. After the index freeze, the rationing of daily necessities (in this city, it is the discounted differential payment) is another remedy for index-based wages. Therefore, the actual variations in the application of the cost-of-living index are numerous.

Article 5 of the Interim Measures for Wage Adjustment states: "If an employer is unable to afford to pay wages in accordance with Articles 3 to 5 of these Measures due to poor production and business conditions, the labor and management parties may agree to reduce them." This provision is more of an extension of application, which is more practical. Because in fact, some are already higher than the index, and some are still lower than the index. This result is mostly obtained from mutual agreement, and it is not necessary for the employer to be really unable to afford it before this principle can be applied.

Land is the price of labor, and the rise and fall of the price has its own natural adjustment rules. In some occasions, it is possible to add various artificial restrictions, but restricting wages is equivalent to restricting prices, and agreeing on wages is equivalent to negotiating prices. Of these two, negotiating prices is more reasonable. However, production and business conditions vary, and even in the same period and the same industry, the strength and profit and loss conditions are not the same. Therefore, the principles of equal pay for equal work and equal pay for equal location are at least not very applicable when negotiating. It is necessary to consider the facts and deliberate separately to seek appropriateness. The authorities' advocacy of individual solutions and separate agreements is considered the most practical and easier to start with than comprehensive assistance.

The so-called separate agreement means separate compromises, so the key lies in mutual harmony and tolerance. Labor and management must know each other, understand each other, and give way to each other before a compromise can be reached. If they only know how to take care of their own positions, insist on unilateral interests, and have no concept of being in the same boat, or if they take the opportunity to cause trouble during the agreement process, create unexpected disputes, and force the other party to reluctantly comply, then even if they succeed temporarily, they will eventually fail. Therefore, in this time of heavy difficulties, we sincerely hope that both parties will broaden their horizons and show the greatest tolerance. We also hope that the authorities will guide both parties with sincerity to find a reasonable solution. As for the so-called purchasing raw materials on behalf, reducing taxes, facilitating transportation, opening up sales channels, and providing legitimate loans, these are indeed fundamental relief measures. If they can advocate and fulfill them in earnest, so that industry and commerce can have a turning point, then what seems powerless today may not be impossible to handle easily in the future. Then, all difficulties can be solved easily.

### To Prevent Communist Forces from Extending into Western Europe, the United States Will No Longer Stand by and Watch; Future Developments Depend on the Attitude of the Soviet Union

[United Press Washington, 12th] Relations between the United States and the Soviet Union have reached a crucial juncture of "showdown" today. Due to the further embrace of the Soviet Union by Hungary and Bulgaria, the United States is prepared to: (1) Unless the Soviet Union agrees to conduct a proper investigation into the way the Hungarian Communist Party overthrew the Nagy government, the United States is prepared to take this matter to the United Nations. (2) To preserve the democratic governments of France, Italy, and Austria, the United States intends to take economic and diplomatic action to build a strong line of defense against the westward advance of communism.

The State Department issued a note to the Soviet Union on the 11th with the strongest tone used by the United States since President Truman announced his anti-totalitarianism doctrine on March 12th. The United States is determined not to allow Moscow's actions in Hungary to go unhindered. The future of US-Soviet relations depends on the Soviet Union's response to the US request for an unfettered investigation into the situation in Hungary. If the Soviet Union rejects the US request, the US intends to appeal to the United Nations. The US's tough note clearly states that the US is considering this plan and condemning the Soviet Union for overthrowing the freely elected Nagy government and brutally interfering in Hungary's internal affairs. The Soviet Union's actions violate the Yalta Agreement. Regardless of the outcome of the US protest, the US is unwilling to stand by and watch as the Communist Party expands its influence to other governments.

Secretary of State Marshall's Policy Planning Staff has been ordered to stop studying world economic problems and their impact on US foreign policy. The committee's work is now focused on Europe, and research is also underway on other "ways to stop communism," such as:

(1) In Italy, the United States intends to provide large-scale assistance to the non-communist government led by Prime Minister Gasperi, including early allocation of $125 million in relief aid after the end of the Allied Forces, approval of Italy's planned use of $100 million in Export-Import Bank loans, release of $60 million in Italian assets frozen in the United States, and commercial, debt, and aviation negotiations with Italy.

(2) In France, the United States supports the World Bank's lending of another $250 million to Prime Minister Ramadier's anti-communist government to assist France's four-year recovery plan. In addition, grains and machinery may be provided as another way to assist France.

(3) In Austria, if the Soviet Union is found to be instigating a coup in Austria, the United States may postpone the long-awaited conclusion of a peace treaty with Austria.

### US Diplomacy Takes a Two-Pronged Approach: Strongly Protests Soviet Incitement of the Hungarian Coup; Condemns Bulgaria's Arrest of Opposition Leaders

[Reuters Washington, 11th] The United States' strong protest to Soviet General Sviridov, chairman of the Allied Control Commission in Hungary, regarding recent events in Hungary was released today. It accused the Soviet Union of openly interfering in Hungarian politics in violation of the Yalta Agreement and requested an immediate investigation into the Hungarian political situation by a tripartite committee. The protest also stated that the US government, in view of its obligations under the Yalta Agreement and as a signatory to the Hungarian Armistice Agreement and a member of the United Nations, will consider other such actions as necessary if it does not obtain agreement on the foregoing measures to conduct a proper investigation. Regarding the alleged confession of Bela Kovacs, Secretary-General of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, the protest stated that the British and American members of the Allied Control Commission were not informed of the information that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Nagy and others, which violated Chapter VI, Section "C" of the Allied Control Commission's military regulations, which stipulates that British and American representatives have the right to obtain copies of all reports and documents of interest to the British and American governments. The US government believes that the development of Hungary has allowed a minority party with only 17 percent of popular support in the last election to abolish the will expressed by the majority of the people. Communist leader Rakosi has apparently admitted this situation and has openly expressed his satisfaction that his iron-clad party has been able to take control of Hungary as a result.

[Reuters Washington, 11th] The State Department issued a statement today condemning the arrest of Bulgarian opposition leader Petkov. The statement said that if Petkov is accused of treason and tried, the current Bulgarian regime will also be judged by the opinions of many Bulgarians and the public opinion of all free people outside Bulgaria. Petkov is a legally elected member of parliament, and his leadership of the opposition and his struggle to defend human rights have aroused the deep sympathy of the United States. The Yalta Agreement, the Bulgarian Armistice Agreement, and the Peace Treaty all contain provisions guaranteeing the freedom of the Bulgarian people. The US government has repeatedly expressed concern about the development of the political situation in Bulgaria, because these developments are completely contrary to the letter and spirit of the Yalta Agreement.

### The Soviet Union and Hungary Negotiate a New Military Alliance; Hungary Sends Military Officers to the Soviet Union for Training

[United Press Hungarian Capital, 11th] According to reliable sources today, the Soviet Union is currently negotiating a new mutual assistance treaty with Hungary for peacetime, so that Hungarian troops can cooperate with Soviet troops in the event of war. The Soviet Union is also secretly training senior Hungarian officers at the Soviet Tactical Academy in Moscow. Former Hungarian Capital Police Chief Zilev and others will be the first group of Hungarians to receive Soviet military training. However, officials in the Ministry of the Army neither confirmed nor denied this statement, as well as the statement that Hungarian officers were observing Soviet military exercises in Transdanubia. According to some Hungarians, the Hungarian radio station broadcast a warning that anyone who discusses such military exercises will be arrested. Informed sources also said that according to the agreement concluded at the end of the war, Hungarian troops were guaranteed to join the Soviet side in the event of war, but this agreement would be invalidated upon final ratification of the peace treaty. Therefore, the Soviet Union is now negotiating and signing a new agreement with Hungary.

### The British Government Takes a Cautious Approach; Watching the Situation in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Austria; Believes that Friendship Should be Established between Britain and the Soviet Union

[Reuters London, 11th] During the foreign affairs debate in the House of Lords, government spokesman Lord Pakenham announced that the British representative in Hungary has been ordered to make it clear to the Hungarian government that the British government is watching the situation in Hungary with extreme caution, and any deviation from democratic principles will seriously affect the political and economic relations between Britain and Hungary.

Regarding the situation in Austria, Pakenham said that the government was deeply disturbed to learn from the newspapers that Austrian politicians were discussing reorganizing the Austrian government to change its nature. The British government is confident that the Austrian government will maintain its democratic foundations and refuse to succumb to any pressure. Pakenham continued that Britain believes that friendship should be established between Britain and the Soviet Union to prevent Europe from being divided into two. For this reason, the government attaches great importance to the British-Soviet trade negotiations. Pakenham also said that the Communist Party has now acquired disproportionate control in Hungary, and it is difficult to determine its attitude towards the situation in Hungary until the government knows whether the Communist Party will consolidate its position regardless of Parliament and the people or whether the Soviet government will fulfill its obligations under the Yalta Agreement as desired by the British government. In view of the Soviet Union's contribution to the liberation of Hungary, the British government has never wanted to exclude the rights that the Soviet Union should enjoy in Hungary, but in such circumstances, Hungary should not be prevented from establishing friendships with other countries. Britain does not believe that the Hungarian people want their country to become a vassal of any strong country, and if the current developments lead to Hungary becoming a totalitarian state and oppressing the current democratic regime, then the British government will have to revise its attitude.

### Indian Princes Preparing to Organize a Union; Planning to Build the Rajisthan State; Also Want to Obtain Dominion Status

### Supports International Control of Atomic Factories, Soviet Representative Offers New Proposals, but the Veto Issue Remains Unresolved

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 11th] During a meeting of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission today, Soviet representative Gromyko declared that the Soviet government supports international control and supervision of all atomic energy factories, mines, and stored materials, indicating significant progress in resolving the atomic energy issue. Gromyko presented several new proposals for establishing international control of atomic energy, first expressing his opinion on the disputed term "supervision," which he had previously refused to explain. While Gromyko's speech is a new step toward compromise, qualified sources point out that Gromyko's proposals are too narrow in scope, and a definitive agreement cannot be reached until the veto issue is resolved. The main points of Gromyko's proposals are as follows:

(1) The atomic energy regulatory agency, namely the International Atomic Energy Commission, should be organized by international personnel. (2) The commission should periodically inspect atomic energy factories, mines, and stored materials in various countries to assess the use of atomic energy. (3) The commission should have the power to provide recommendations to governments and the Security Council regarding measures to be taken against countries that violate the convention prohibiting the manufacture of atomic weapons. (4) The commission should also have the right to study atomic energy for peaceful purposes to maintain effective control. Countries may also individually conduct atomic energy research for peaceful purposes, but they must exchange their atomic energy discoveries and progress with the International Control Commission.

US representative Austin expressed disagreement with the Soviet proposal, stating that if the methods of reducing general armaments and atomic armaments are considered simultaneously, it would exceed the authority granted to this committee by the Security Council.

### Wang Jingwei's Treason Was Premeditated in the Autumn of 1938

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Lieutenant General Kagesa Teishō, the highest advisor to the former puppet government and the head of the "Kikan" special agency, recently submitted a detailed account of Wang Jingwei's collusion with Japan in his defense statement to the military tribunal. According to reports, in the autumn of 1938, Colonel Imaida had already drafted a "peace proposal" with Umekawa, and in November, Kagesa and Imaida went to Shanghai to meet with Umekawa again and decided to publish the so-called one-to-many peace conditions at the same time as Wang Jingwei escaped from Chongqing. On December 20, 1938, when Wang Jingwei arrived in Hanoi, Konoe immediately issued the so-called Thirty Principles declaration on the 22nd, and Wang Jingwei immediately responded with a telegram of support. Kagesa himself, along with Vice Minister Shigemitsu and Inukai Ken (son of former Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, who was the Democratic Party Secretary-General before this election and has been reorganized), rushed to Hanoi and arrived in Shanghai on the same boat as Wang Jingwei, and the plan to establish an independent government was agreed upon with Wang Jingwei on the boat. Kagesa also revealed that Japan supported Wang Jingwei on the one hand, and on the other hand, Foreign Minister Matsuoka and others attempted to lure the National Government of China, which was resisting Japan, but their conspiracy ultimately failed.

### US Military Government Officials Reveal That Japanese Zaibatsu Have Not Been Eliminated and Still Have the Power to Influence the Japanese Government

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] A spokesman for MacArthur's headquarters reported today that the backbone of Japanese zaibatsu control has been destroyed, which is quite contrary to the opinion of American officials in Osaka. According to Welch, director of the Antitrust Division of the headquarters' Economic and Scientific Section, the medical and investment rights of 67 major Japanese industrial companies have been taken over by the Japanese government's Liquidation Committee. However, officials of the Osaka Military Government told United Press reporters last week that the Japanese zaibatsu have not been eliminated, and the dissolution of their industrial companies, the sale of their stocks, and the disqualification of industrial magnates have had little practical impact on ending the zaibatsu system. Many current officials still consult them, and the stocks are manipulated, making it unclear who actually owns them. Although economic leaders have been reorganized, they still control industry from behind the scenes. The industrialists in Osaka have a strong influence and can actually influence the Tokyo government. Although the Socialist Prime Minister has formed a coalition government, it has not changed this balance.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 12th] The Ministry of Finance announced today that Emperor Hirohito of Japan is listed first on the Japanese taxpayer list and must pay 3.3 billion yen in income tax this year. The zaibatsu such as Sumitomo, Mitsui, and Iwasaki are next, each of which must pay between 50 million and 100 million yen.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 11th] Kintale Gawawa, leader of the Sundanese People's Party, recently spoke about the party's economic program, stating that Indonesians must break the economic control of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The first step will be to consolidate the Indonesian middle class, especially the Sundanese middle class, and then confront the exploitation of the upper class and Chinese chambers of commerce. Before the war, the debts of the Indonesian middle class to overseas Chinese lenders accounted for 55% of the debtors' debts, which has now increased to 75%. The commercial companies established by this party in and around Bandung supply goods to the people at a price that is only one-third of the market price controlled by overseas Chinese merchants.

### Disputes over Cost-of-Living Index-Based Wages Increase, Labor-Management Conflicts Rise Daily, Shoe Industry Crisis Escalates, Fashion Industry Strike Begins Yesterday, Employers Demand Rectification of Labor Discipline

[Our Report] Disputes over the cost-of-living index are erupting everywhere. The Social Affairs Bureau's principle is to resolve them individually for each factory, handling them separately. Some employers are demanding that the Social Affairs Bureau rectify labor discipline.

The dispute involving the hand-operated knitting machine groups in the first, second, and third districts, which resulted in a siege of the Songshan Police Station until late at night, continued to be mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning, but without result. The Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau has transferred the case to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee.

Workers in the shoe industry began a slowdown at the beginning of the week due to disputes over the cost-of-living index. Yesterday, the situation escalated, with striking workers forming teams to post slogans in the Dongxinqiao Xiaohua Garden and other store areas, and persuading non-striking workers to stop working. The police station considered this action to be disruptive to order and arrested several workers in various districts, who were released after persuasion. At 5 pm yesterday, the trade association held a meeting at the Heming Shoe and Hat Store to discuss countermeasures. Upon hearing the news, the workers rushed there and gathered in front of the door, with a great uproar. The police station sent police to the scene to maintain order, and the meeting was also stopped as a result. According to the person in charge of the trade association, the employers currently have no other recourse but to wait for mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the official documents have been submitted that day.

Workers in the fashion industry went on strike yesterday morning and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau. In addition to advising the workers to resume work immediately, the bureau convened both parties for mediation at 11 am. The labor side demanded payment based on the index, while the employer agreed to first pay a portion. The two sides did not reach an agreement.

Tofu Industry

Some tofu industry workers have resumed work yesterday, but the Social Affairs Bureau needs to wait for all workers to resume work before discussing further.

Electrical Knitting

According to the previous contract between the labor and management sides of the electrical knitting machine groups in the first, second, and third districts, wages are to be paid according to the previous month's index. Now that the index has been unfrozen from May, if wages are paid according to the regulations, it would be 7,945 times plus a difference of 117,000 yuan. The workers believe that this amount cannot maintain their livelihood and demand payment based on 14,800 times.

Photographic Plate Making

The employer in the photographic plate making industry submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that they cannot bear the index of 23,500 times and requested a discount in addition to the stipulated method.

Mirror Making

The labor side of the mirror making industry submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, alleging that the employer did not pay wages according to the index. The labor side of the thermos bottle industry also submitted a document, alleging that the employer wanted to pay wages based on 80% of the previous month's index and requested correction.

Bathhouse Industry

Workers in the furnace rooms of bathhouses claimed that the employer had not been paying wages according to the index since January. Now that the index has been unfrozen, they demand that it be paid accordingly.

Dyeing Industry

Six hundred employees in the dyeing industry requested improved treatment. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated yesterday and agreed on a solution.

Printing Industry

Regarding the printing industry dispute, the Social Affairs Bureau convened the employer's trade association and the labor side's printing and letterpress workers' union for mediation yesterday. The employer expressed dissatisfaction, and the Social Affairs Bureau decided to make a ruling according to the law.

### Families of Officers and Soldiers Killed in the Fubo Incident Request Relief from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company

### Difficulty of Purchasing a Ticket Voucher Exceeds Purchasing a Ticket, Railway Bureau Discusses Improvements

[Our Report] The newly built second, third, and fourth-class passenger waiting room at the North Railway Station opened yesterday, and a new method was implemented. Passengers must first purchase a "ticket purchase order voucher" and then enter the room to exchange for a ticket with the voucher. The original purpose of this method was to facilitate passengers and eliminate scalpers. Unexpectedly, the initial trial run yesterday created difficulties, and the effect was the opposite. Passengers all complained. In view of the actual situation, the Railway Bureau decided to convene a meeting today to seek improvement measures.

The waiting room is 400 meters long and about 50 meters wide. Within ten steps of entering the door, there are four entrances for passage. The order vouchers are sold here, but because the area is too narrow, buyers are crowded, and even after queuing, it is difficult to maintain order. Therefore, it is generally believed that the difficulty of purchasing a voucher exceeds purchasing a ticket. Yesterday, many of the ticket window glass were broken by passengers. Although Chen Shuhuang, the chief of the North Station, the head of the baggage room, and senior officials from the Transportation Department directed work in the room all day, order was still not restored.

### Three Principles Determined for United Power Plant, Purely Private Organization Hopes for Foreign Investment

[Our Report] To solve the city's electricity shortage, the City Council has approved the unification of the city's power generation institutions and the organization of a united power plant. The reporter specifically visited Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue yesterday to inquire about the planning of the united power plant. According to Director Zhao, the city's electricity supply is extremely alarming, and the organization of a united power plant is necessary to concentrate funds, save resources, and allow machinery and specialized personnel to be coordinated and applied. Therefore, the Public Utilities Bureau absolutely supports the proposal of the City Council. The bureau has decided on the following three major principles for the united power plant in terms of financial resources, material resources, and organization:

In terms of funds: The united power plant hopes to utilize foreign investment and also welcomes strong domestic funds, with each accounting for half of the total. On the foreign investment side, US funds are the most likely. On the domestic side, it is hoped that all existing power companies can actively participate. The shortfall will be filled by inviting bankers and entrepreneurs to invest.

In terms of machinery: It is requested that the central government consider the severity of the city's electricity shortage and prioritize the allocation of Japanese reparations materials to the united power plant for application. There is currently a 53,000-kilowatt generator that was shipped from Japan, and the central government has agreed to allocate it to the city for application first, and it will arrive in Shanghai soon. In addition, there are several 35,000-kilowatt generators that the bureau has also requested the central government to allocate to the city. Furthermore, the united power plant will request preferential rights to purchase state-owned enterprises that are being sold off to private entities by the central government.

In terms of organization: The organization of the united power plant is purely private and absolutely democratic. The municipal government does not participate in any shares and will absorb as many Chinese companies in the city as possible. All existing power companies will become shareholders of the united power plant. When electricity is needed, they can purchase it from the plant. The contract will be drafted by each company themselves. The original rights of each power company will be protected as much as possible. As for the detailed organization contract of the united power plant, Director Zhao told the reporter that the bureau will invite the persons in charge of the city's power companies and invite representatives from the City Council to discuss it together. After the specific contract is drafted, it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval and then to the City Council for decision. After the City Council approves it, it will be submitted to the central government for approval.

Question from Yu Xingchu: A female relative of mine is 19 years old. Her father died three years ago, leaving only her and her mother. Her paternal cousin is forcing her to adopt an heir and is coercing her to sign an inheritance agreement. She is afraid to resist due to his intimidating behavior.

### Insufficient Reserves - Situation Tense for Victory and Happiness

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Shipping News] Hong Kong's sports scene has been quiet since the start of summer, and the holding of the Guangdong Provincial Games has drawn away some athletes, reducing the enthusiasm for small football matches.

There are rumors that teams from the Philippines and Shantou will be visiting Hong Kong, but in terms of Hong Kong's basketball standards, it should be no problem to deal with the Chaozhou-Shantou team, but it is hard to imagine competing against the Philippines. The news that the Shanghai-Shantou team was coming to Hong Kong caused considerable excitement here, but only the sound of footsteps was heard, and the people were not seen.

## Sing Tao Conquers the Philippines

Since arriving in Manila, the Sing Tao team has reported successive victories, especially in the match against the Jin Min champion team.

In the second half, Feng Jingxiang scored two goals in the fourth and eighteenth minutes, respectively, to reverse the score to 2-1. Then the Lianle team's right striker scored a goal, making it 2-2. The victory was only determined in the last few minutes, with Li Zhaorong scoring the winning goal. While in Min, the mayor presented each of them with a "gold-plated key to the Philippines." The biggest loss for the Sing Tao team's expedition is the lack of reserve players. If the two central wingers are injured, the lineup will be a big problem. This may be one of the reasons for their defeat when they arrive in England in the future. Qiu Ting is still recovering from his injuries and has not played in recent games.

In the County League final, the match between Nanhai and Wuhua ended in a 3-3 draw. The spectators supporting Wuhua beat the referee Zhu Guolun, and the meeting broke up unhappily. The organizers had no choice but to declare the two teams joint champions. When the Municipal Police team forfeited the Provincial Championship final due to various reasons, Sanshui won without a fight. Such sporting achievements make one afraid to think about the future of sports in our country.

### Reasons for the Postponement of the National Games

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, June 11] Hao Gengsheng talked about the postponement of the National Games in the afternoon of June 11, saying that the biggest key to the postponement of the National Games was not that the Executive Yuan did not subsidize 2 billion, but that the venue could not be repaired by the Double Tenth Festival (October 10). The advantages of changing to May 5th next year are two: (1) According to the regulations, the qualifications of athletes must be in the institution or school for three months. If it is held on the Double Tenth Festival, the university freshmen will have just entered school after the summer, and the qualification is difficult to determine. (2) Many overseas Chinese who want to participate enthusiastically may not be able to make it for this year's Double Tenth Festival. Although the meeting period has been extended, the preparatory work has not only not been relaxed, but has been intensified. Director Zhao of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau recently came to Nanjing to negotiate with the Ministry of National Defense on the transfer of the venue. Now the track and field venue has been completely vacated, and the rest is also in the plan of relocation,

Spring and Autumn Records "Red Flame Market" - The Writing Techniques of a French Film Li Qingya

In China, especially in Shanghai, French films are not generally noticed by those who pay attention to films. This phenomenon certainly has various commercial factors, but another fundamental factor is that the general public's love for American films is like their love for jazz music, both stemming from the same type of motivation. Therefore, French films, like symphonic music, are only considered by a few art enthusiasts to be cultural crystallizations with their own life in the film and music worlds.

The French are a nation that deeply loves art, so they are particularly able to show a kind of spirit in their comprehensive art works. Of course, there will be no exceptions in their films. The French films that have been shown in China before can prove this point, and the "Red Flame Market," recently made in Paris, especially illustrates the characteristics of French films.

"Red Flame Market" may have the opportunity to come to the Far East. Now, I may as well introduce to readers the French records and criticisms of it.

On May 4, 1897, a terrible fire draped mourning clothes over many famous families in France. On that day, in just ten minutes, the charity department store turned into ashes in the flames, and one hundred and twenty-four ladies and gentlemen in the store encountered the devil of death.

This department store was originally a charity bazaar. That year, its initiators built a temporary building on an open space between two fire residences on Rue Jean-Goujon in Paris to serve as this charity sales office. The entire structure was constructed of wood and fabric, with the fabric resembling two streets from the Middle Ages, with residences and shops. The entire building had a wide facade painted with pine lacquer and many inward-pushing doors, and the roof was covered with tarred rough canvas.

The sales office was managed by housewives and young ladies from many famous families in Paris, the most famous of whom was the Duchess of Alençon. Therefore, the richness of the scene need not be described further. In particular, the curiosity of Parisians was attracted by the screening of moving pictures, which the advertisement at the time called "the strange invention of the century, capable of performing illusions of real life, recently successfully produced by Mr. Louis Lumière."

Who would have thought that on this day, the 4th, when thousands of customers were bustling through the narrow aisles of the department store, a cry suddenly burst out in the projection room: Fire!

It turned out that the light-emitting body for the projection was a rod-shaped lime essence burned to white heat with an oxyether flame. At this time, the set of tools exploded. In less than three to five minutes, the flames devoured the tarred canvas, and the canvas immediately collapsed onto the wood and fabric that made up the building. This was truly an indescribable horror. Crowds of people rushed towards the exit, but the inward-opening doors closed under the outward pushing force, thus preventing people from exiting the burning market—since that day, French regulations have stipulated that the doors of public places must open outwards.

Several other exits were properly opened, but the speed of the disaster, the high temperature, and the thick smoke all hindered the firefighters.

In about ten minutes, everything was burned. One hundred and seventeen women and girls, five men, and two boys were all burned into charcoal.

This unexpected disaster inspired Mr. Paul Meurisse, the screenwriter known for the films "The Heart Within" and "The Servant Who Looks Like the Master," to recreate the tragic scene of the charity department store in a new film called "Red Flame Market."

In the scenery, the era is 1894. A painter named Claude, who is a resident of the slums, meets a young bourgeois female artist, Agnès. Their pastoral melodies have been exhibited in various artistic circles of Montmartre in those years, in the Sacré-Cœur Basilica, which was still under construction at the time, and in the luxurious and fashionable cafes of the time.

This young couple eventually get married. Claude often takes his wife to upper-class entertainment venues. But in an era when Agnès has always held the position of a talented artist praised by those around her, Claude, tempted by a bit of lucky success, has commercialized himself and started a business. He quarreled with Agnès several times due to professional jealousy, and she finally abandoned him.

During this period, the initiators of the charity department store, in order to enrich their merchandise, sought an oil painting from Agnès through Claude. However, this hurt Claude's self-esteem, so he only took out one of her early works. On May 4, 1897, Claude went to Rue Jean-Goujon to visit the auction. He met Agnès in the market, and in order to avoid a disturbance, he led her to a dressing room and locked her in. But the fire broke out, and Claude, who was in the midst of the terrified crowd, was not strong enough, and he could not rescue the unfortunate ginger from the flames.

Although he himself was saved, in his forty years of life, he always regretted his initial actions. Finally, he met the god of death in a fire in a large department store in Paris in 1937.

Jean Gabin, who plays Claude in this film, is extremely natural, and Seraphine Dujardin, who plays Agnès, can be called a genius of the early soil film. Claude's close friend, Mr. Martin, played by Jean Darcante, is indeed able to capture the phlegmatic humor.

The musical work is done by Maurice Thiriet, and the scores in it can indeed create an atmosphere that is extremely suitable for the various scenes of this tragicomic drama. However, the main compelling force of this film is the fire in the department store, which can make those audiences who have truly experienced the horror and the impression of the flames on life feel deep pain in a quarter of an hour.

During the set design, Meurisse and his collaborators actually recreated the authentic equipment of the charity department store in the photography studio. And the extras on stage were all carefully selected because they all had considerable agility to escape safely from the flames. In France, this is truly the first time.

Some of the hours in terror were captured from certain corners of this installation that were set on fire and immediately extinguished. Therefore, when many cameras recorded the fire from various angles, the entire installation finally came together.

However, this set, in less than a quarter of an hour, was buried in the flames, just like the fire on Rue Jean-Goujon fifty years ago—where a church has now been built to commemorate it.

From the story of this film, we can already see the extraordinary writing skills of the screenwriter. As for the arrangement of the plot, the coordination of the scenes, and even the selection of talents, it can certainly make people see its comprehensiveness in art. I very much hope that we in Shanghai can have the opportunity to appreciate it.

Night Huang Yun

Child: Do you like the night? Don't you feel the terror of the night? Can you imagine those stories and legends that belong to the night!

In this world, the authority of the night is everywhere; the daytime also reflects the darkness of the night, and is even more terrible than the night.

The night we exist in is when the daytime dies, no, the daytime should be dead forever.

Child: Are you palpitating? I have already tried that your hand is trembling very hard. Don't be afraid, it is our shadows that the green lamp reflects on the white wall. Look at the white moth beside the lamp, it will make a sacrifice to this light. Everyone loves the light, but why is this world too suffocating and too bleak?

Open the dusty wooden window! Take a look at the night outside, how deep it is, you see: the sky is very cloudy, there is no moon, and no stars; it looks like it is going to rain. Look at the winter jasmine and holly trees beside the wall, swaying in the night wind, darker and darker. This wind is a bit cool, and spring cold is most likely to hurt people.

Sit down, come closer to me, let me tell you a story of the night. Do you know how hard the travelers in the dark night are trekking? In the wilderness, in the forest, in the valley... the phosphorus fire of those ancient tombs. The wind whistles in the forest and the wolves howl in the valley; the road is rugged and difficult to walk, and under the valley is a deep and rapid current. If you are not careful, you will lose your life.

You say that the dark night is full of ghosts, but the traveler will not be confused by ghosts, because the devils of the dark night are very kind, only the devils of the daytime are very fierce. Have you heard the legend of ghosts? Ghosts have emotions that are more sincere and passionate than humans.

——Under this green lamp, perhaps

a figure will come in, do you feel scared? In your cold world, there are crowds of people who are more vicious than ghosts...

Listen: it's raining outside, the raindrops are not knocking on the window, this night is too desolate and lonely. Okay! Let me tell you another story of a ghost in a rainy night. ——In a rainy night like now, it was an ancient castle close to a deserted tomb. On this night, a traveler from afar stayed in this ancient castle. He had traveled thousands of mountains and rivers to get here. On a rainy night, he sat under the green lamp looking at the oil paintings on the walls. This old house was full of mystery and horror. Suddenly, he heard a subtle cry from the ancient tomb outside. At this time, the iron horse in the corner of the house was ringing ding-dong, and the phoenix trees outside the window were making a rustling sound from the wind and rain.

There was a soft sound of footsteps outside, the door gradually opened, and a huge black hand stretched in...

Oh! Are you afraid? If so, then I won't tell you anymore. Don't be afraid, no ghosts will come tonight.

The night is not over yet, you hope for dawn, but true dawn will not come out. In the night, a quiet life is happiness!

Listen: the rain and the night watch outside, isn't the old night watchman's pace far away? …………

A Poem Gifted with Tang Yun's Portrait Bai Jiao

Qian Lingxiu Zhong Dashi, Dashi was young and now Lingbo; the ups and downs of rivers and mountains get rid of traces, calling for ink, playful and winning the first seat; when the interest comes, the ancient temple is full of books, too lazy to exchange for gold. Seeing off guests, I go on a boat to Fuyang, looking at the mountains, getting people is like seeing immortals; the group books in the chest open the old Zen, the deities under the pen are noble and contemporary sages; countless works are released, forming ancient joy, there is often no rice in the heart at night and often wide; I know filial piety and friendship are rooted in nature, and discussions are heard about people's illnesses; poems are not often made, talent wins itself, eyes are low but powerful, the heart is like a mirror, the teacher's reputation for painting is great, and ten thousand readers are worthy of testifying. I painted this for Mr. as a gift, and I'm waiting for the watch to express my feelings. (Made for Yun's painting exhibition)

Staying Overnight in a Mountain Village Song Zhuping

At night, the cold wind once again rolls up the clear snow on the ground, lightly striking the window paper, the lamplight shaking in solitude, outside is a boundless blue sky and solemn black night, a pile of embers accompanies me, and strands of lonely feeling suddenly float to my heart, surrounded by frightening dead silence, cold. It should be late at night now, right!

I still vaguely remember: last year, at this time, on such a night. ——

At that time, I was on a strenuous mountain journey on foot. It was also such a night. I was reluctant to hurry on my way and missed the inn. In winter, as soon as dusk came, the night quietly descended. When I was still lovingly watching the barren West Mountain, dyed with the faint red of the setting sun, the stars had already filled the sky. The night sky is full of beautiful sentiment, but the mountain wind is howling, also just clear snow, the oncoming fierce wind and sand, and the biting cold, I am a little afraid, this area is the haunt of green forest heroes. Finally, in this mountain where I couldn't see any signs of human habitation, I found a small shop. You must congratulate me, yes, at that time, even I myself secretly and deeply congratulated myself on my good luck.

I knocked on the door of the small shop. The small shop had no more than three rooms in total. There were no guests staying there. Only the shopkeeper himself was sitting around the firewood on the ground. A warm air greeted me, and a dim oil lamp was lit in the corner of the wall. These made me forget how humble the small shop was. I leaned my crutch against the wall, threw my only small luggage on the earthen bed, and then patted the dust off my body and sat opposite the shopkeeper, also getting close to the fire.

We sat silently, neither of us thought of speaking. Only the dry firewood crackled softly, embellishing the coldness of the air. I buried my head and just warmed myself by the fire. When I was warm all over, I raised my head. I was almost stunned. The shopkeeper was staring at me fiercely. He was wearing a blue cotton-padded jacket, with an old felt hat on his head, his face full of beards, his iron-green face was illuminated by the raging firewood and became a miserable green, his eyes were full of bloodshot eyes, and I seemed to have seen his sharp gaze in some unusual place. Suddenly, I couldn't help but shiver, and I thought nervously and uneasily: He is doing the business of killing people and stealing goods! So, I have fallen into a black shop. Everything in front of me is dark, filled with cruelty, coldness, and viciousness, painted into a bloody picture.

After another silent moment, I suppressed my heartbeat, avoided his gaze, and cautiously began to chat with him, inquiring about some unimportant things about him. He only hummed with his nasal voice. Finally, when he seemed a little tired and yawned, I deliberately and unintentionally told him: "There is a team of Lala soldiers (Note) behind us. If we can't catch up with the lunch in the morning, I'm afraid we will have to have breakfast here tomorrow morning."

This time he finally opened his mouth: "Will they arrive tomorrow morning?" This voice was a bit like the hiss of a wounded beast. I was extremely afraid of hearing this kind of voice, and I timidly nodded to him, feeling a shiver of numbness in my heart. We were silent again.

Before I went to sleep, when I was lying on the earthen bed, I deliberately revealed my simple and worn luggage to him. He enthusiastically filled another handful of burning wheat straw into the earthen bed for me. All night, I was lying on the scorching earthen bed, vaguely awake with an uneasy mood, repeatedly listening to the north wind rolling up the clear snow and lightly striking the window paper, and thinking in fear: He shouldn't be plotting against me, right?

The next day, the stars were still very bright, and the crescent moon hung gracefully on the eastern treetops. I hurriedly got up, left the small shop, and began my mountain journey again, carrying my small luggage. I walked twenty miles on the rugged mountain road full of frozen snow. On another mountain top, I joyfully greeted the dawn. The east turned white, and in the haze, it was still shining with dazzling golden light.

When the sun came out, my heart also melted in the warm sunshine. Last night was really a nightmare, and I also started to tell a lie, smiling at my nervousness at the first sun.

(Note) It is a large rubber-wheeled cart pulled by three or four animals. In the Northwest, it is almost a more important means of transportation than trucks.

Night Sounds Wei Xiaoping

In everyday life, there are more profound tragic elements than in the tragedies of major events. ——Maeterlinck:

I am most afraid of spending this night,

Whenever I see the footsteps of night stepping on my head, my whole body turns cold, and I can't suppress the surge of confusion and bewilderment.

In the night, a plaintive voice occasionally floats past the window, which once triggered my homesickness as a wanderer. But whenever I think of the cries of "mung bean porridge" in my hometown, there were also cries of "fried rice sugar water" for sale in Sichuan, which are so lingering and unforgettable, but now they have changed to:

"Spiced eggs"!

I dare not say that this sound is necessarily good or bad, but I always feel that it is too desolate, and the desolation makes it difficult for people to listen to it for a long time, like what a foreign missionary heard in Guangzhou in the past: "Selling - salty! Sand! Pears" as if thinking, as if admiring, as if weeping, as if complaining, one can't help but feel a surge of compassion and sympathy.

But tonight, I didn't hear this sound.

The wind has picked up again outside. Click, click, from the swirling wind that echoes against the crooked blue walls, a burst of wind is whipping the doors and windows, and also startling the barking of dogs. The dog seems to have already sensed something. It seems to be catching up with the past, barking fiercely, and then retreating and whimpering, and then suddenly attacking forward again...

I can't calm down, my heart is jumping uneasily, guessing: "Is this going to cause trouble?"

Quietly pushing open the window, the night is a sea surging with black mist, dark and heavy, opening its big mouth, swallowing everything, even me, even my eyes. There is only one star of light, shining in from the alley, pale green, flickering and expanding is it a will-o'-the-wisp? A firefly?

A few monotonous footsteps, and another urgent dog barking.

"Hey, is it a human or a ghost?" I stretched my head out and shouted, raising my voice

"Hmm?" A furious reply from outside the window. "Of course it's a human."

"What are you doing?"

"Selling spiced eggs"!

"Ah! It's you, why don't you shout?" I was happy, as if drifting in the vast sea for many years, and met an old friend again. But then I thought: "Egg seller, are you sick?" The night before, when I bought from him, the clothes he was wearing were tattered, his eyes were sunken, his voice was hoarse, and I felt that this person would be tormented by life.

I thought of indescribable sadness, and walked out the door following my legs, as if sinking in ice, I could only struggle out through the heavy pressure in my throat with sobs.

"Are you sick?" I asked.

He shook his head.

"Then why don't you shout?"

He pointed to the outside of the alley, where it seemed to have a pair of night hawk's eyes, which would make these idle people tremble. He said: "They don't let me make a sound."

"Is there trouble? No wonder the dog is barking so hard."

He laughed instead, laughing coldly: "There they say they want to hunt down bad people... Bad people coming out at night,"

I didn't quite understand.

He only blinked his eyes, and then dropped a painful sigh: "There's no way. Who doesn't live for life. Look at me, sir, our family, old and young, all rely on earning this little money to live on. Night, chaos, bad people, all are just..."

"Bang"! A gunshot! The dog barked even louder.

Many hurried footsteps running, "Catch him, catch him". Someone shouted, and a sudden woman's cry drowned that out.

"They caught a bad guy again! Male? Female? Alas, alas!" The egg seller seemed to be calm. He bent down and twisted the lamp head, and the flame rose with it. In the lamplight, I saw again that dull face that had lost the vitality of a human.

I couldn't help but agitate and say: "Now you can open your throat and shout."

He said: "It's very difficult, very difficult, things at night are uncertain."

He left, moving his steps with difficulty, and walked past.

I opened my eyes wide in this night.

The Summer of Beibei Hot Springs in the Temporary Capital Peng Dehan

"Beibei Hot Springs" is one of the scenic spots in the suburbs of the temporary capital. It is the most beautiful scenery among the famous "Four Great Hot Springs". Three years ago, dignitaries, wealthy merchants, and giants almost all came here to escape the summer heat. The beautiful Western-style buildings in Beibei Hot Springs Park are the relics of the past. The Chongqing Summer Camp in 1943 was also held in the deep green shade of "Beibei Hot Springs".

Jinyun Mountain is above it. The emerald-like Jialing River cuts off the Jinyun Mountain Range, and flows between the thousand-foot cliffs. The stone teeth at the bottom of the water and the valley wind on the river stir up turbulent waves. The waves hit the towering rocks beside the mountains, and the pine trees on the mountains and the whispering hot springs interweave an endless song. The reflections of the red peach blossoms on the banks are set against the rugged white stones under the green stream, reflecting the swaying dance posture. Because the rocks in the western and central parts collapsed into the river, forming a terrace dozens of acres in size, the north and south ends embrace the rock walls on the east bank, forming this beautiful scenery in the southwest—Beibei Hot Springs.

The verdant pines and cypresses are transformed into a dark velvet curtain. Strange flowers and herbs are laid flat on this beautiful scenery like patterns, and surrounded by red walls and green tiles, carved beams and painted pillars of palaces and temples, and exquisite pavilions, walking in the cypress-lined trails, or lying on the green lawn, looking up at the blue and boundless sky, with a few floating clouds, the red light of the setting sun, shooting on the white edges, becoming golden borders, the various changing beautiful scenery in the sky, reflecting the summer of Beibei Hot Springs, making tourists feel a reluctance to leave this scene.

The hot spring pool in the hot spring bath is founded by the management office of Beibei Hot Springs Park. Tourists are like shuttles under Beibei Hot Springs Park, next to the Jialing River. It is a new-style bathing place rebuilt using temples. The door is inscribed with the words "Dust Removal", which is very appropriate. The bathing place is divided into three parts: single room, inner pool, and outer pool. The bath ticket for a single room is 500 yuan, while the outer pool of the open-air swimming pool only costs 250 yuan. Compared with the soaring prices, it is indeed a popular and mass-oriented paradise.

Several tourists are climbing the White Bird Pavilion at the high point of Beibei Hot Springs Park, climbing up the stone steps next to the Zhenwa Hall. Standing on the White Bird Pavilion, you can appreciate the lines of the poem "Shu Mountain is green and Shu Mountain is beautiful", and you will feel the greatness and tenderness of the mountains and rivers of Beibei Hot Springs; your emotions will be entrusted to the green mountains and entrusted to the green water. You can clearly see the Beibei Hot Springs Park between the green mountains and the silk water. Flowers bloom and fall, and the park becomes a patterned painting that changes with the seasons. On the pavilion are the seven characters "Green Mountains and Green Waters White Bird Pavilion" inscribed by President Yu Youren.

Dusk, only at dusk, is the most memorable moment in Beibei Hot Springs. Any place is a beautiful shot worth remembering, especially on the Love Nest Pond next to the Great Buddha Hall. Sitting on the small island surrounded by crushed green willows, dark red鲜花, half-mountain and half-water, all distracting thoughts will be washed away by the beautiful scenery, and all worries will float into the distant sky. The clouds and smoke of Jinyun Mountain linger, and the waves of the Jialing River are turbulent. Beibei Hot Springs at the foot of Jinyun Mountain and on the bank of the Jialing River is exactly the "summer" paradise and the "summer" paradise. The hot summer makes the entire temporary capital city covered in a sultry atmosphere, but the hot summer cannot dominate the Beibei Hot Springs in the northern suburbs of the temporary capital.

Secrets of the Moon Void Person

Everything on the moon was originally a secret, but due to the progress of science, this secret has gradually been revealed.

There is no air on the moon at all. If a person comes to the moon from the earth, he will immediately explode due to the pressure in his body.

Many things on Earth also exist on the moon, such as deserts, grasslands, mountains, and volcanoes, but there are no living things, oceans, or rivers, and not even a drop of water can be found.

One day on the moon is equal to two weeks on Earth, and its night is also as long as two weeks on Earth. The temperature difference between day and night on the moon is extremely large. The sun's rays reach the earth after passing through the atmosphere, but the sun's rays reach the moon directly. Therefore, at noon, if you put a pot of ice water on the rocks on the moon exposed to sunlight, it will boil in a minute or two. At this time, if there are humans on the moon, they can only hide in the rock caves that sunlight cannot reach. Once night falls, the heat of the moon is rapidly radiated into the air, and the temperature drops so much that any liquid can turn into ice. At this time, people can only survive by wearing insulated clothing.

The "moon's gravity" on the surface of the moon is only one-fifth of the earth's gravity. Therefore, everything on Earth will lose four-fifths of its weight after coming to the moon. For example, a person weighing two hundred pounds will only weigh forty pounds on the moon.

Humans will be able to go to the moon in the future. The means of transportation may be rockets. However, the engine of the rocket carrying people to the moon must use atomic energy as fuel, and the speed of the rocket must reach ten miles per second. The average distance between the moon and the earth is about two million miles. Using such a rocket to carry people to the moon will only take three or four days to reach the moon.

Today, the most precious metal in the world is rare things like "uranium", but according to scientists' research, due to the special rock and geological structure on the moon, a large amount of uranium ore and other radioactive metals are buried on the moon. Therefore, in the future, atomic energy can be used in large quantities on the moon to build cities, so that humans can live on the moon. For example, use atomic energy to extract oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen from the minerals on the moon to supply air and water, use atomic energy to supply heating and light, and regulate the atmospheric temperature.

If the moon can be controlled, the entire earth can be completely controlled militarily, because the "moon's gravity" is four-fifths smaller than the earth's gravity. From the moon, fire-preemptive bombs can be used to bomb any place on the earth very conveniently, the aiming force is very accurate, and the degree of destruction is very large, but it is thousands of times more difficult to bomb the moon from the earth, because the earth's gravity is five times greater than the moon's gravity. Therefore, in the future atomic age, ambitious military aggressors will not only control important strategic areas on the earth, but also try to occupy the moon as the foundation for conquering the world.

Between China and Japan Bao Qing

China The 19th anniversary of the "Jinan Massacre". Master Mai allowed the Japanese government offices, parliament, and imperial palace to re-hang the Japanese flag from now on.

The bronze statue of the "Three Brave Soldiers of the Flesh Bomb" commemorating the aftermath of the January 28 Shanghai Battle in Japan still stands.

Among the national humiliation souvenirs in the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, only the anchor chain and shells have been retrieved. The two anchors are still being negotiated for transportation. As for other Chinese military equipment such as general cannons, dragon flags, naval public office pictures, and local officials' virtue monuments, their whereabouts are still unknown.

Salt is the main raw material for industry. The large amount of salt exported from China to Japan is in response to Master Mai's requirements to take care of the people's food. Moreover, Master Mai also allowed Japan to fish in the Chinese Sea and restore the textile industry, which infringes on China's Huai industry and hinders China's textile industry. Li Zhuchu said; it is no different from feeding the tiger that invaded China with the milk of the Chinese people.

At the Far East International Military Tribunal, the prosecutors of the United States, China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other eleven countries accused Japanese Class A war criminals in a public prosecution indictment, listing 54 crimes. There were 18 cases related to China, including: one case of plotting to loot East Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, one case of conspiring to invade our country, four cases of launching aggression against our country, six cases of attacking our country's local areas and carrying out murders, and four cases of contempt for international law, scheming, executing, or failing to prevent the killing or mistreatment of prisoners of war and civilians.

Caring for the Motherland Liu Meng

The overseas Chinese in Penang sent a telegram to Shen Bao on the 6th, expressing their concern for the student unrest that has repeatedly occurred in the motherland, and their feelings are profound. The first passenger plane on the China-America route of Pan American Airlines in the United States also brought a wreath from overseas Chinese in San Francisco to offer to the tomb of the founding father of the country. A telegram, a wreath, is not worth much, but its meaning is very deep, fully showing the love of overseas Chinese for the motherland.

Overseas Chinese care about the motherland very much. On the one hand, it is because the Chinese people's love for their homeland is very deep. The ancients also said, "Entrusting oneself to a foreign country is what the ancients grieved"; on the other hand, it is also because of the unequal treatment they have received overseas, so their concern for governance is deeper than anyone else's.

Roosevelt's Legacy Arlin

According to a New York dispatch from this newspaper on the 6th, the executor of Roosevelt's estate submitted a liquidation report to the Surrogate Court today. When Roosevelt passed away on April 12, 1945, the value of his estate was 1.94 million US dollars, of which 990,000 US dollars were obtained from his mother's inheritance. Due to the repayment of debts and other expenses, the actual total amount is now 1.43 million US dollars.

This is the wealth of Roosevelt as a great man in modern times. Except for what he inherited, his lifetime income was only 400,000 US dollars. Compared with the wealth figures of the 60 richest families in the United States, it is really insignificant. Probably, here "serving as an official and then becoming rich" is a rule in the East, but for Roosevelt, it loses its meaning.

From this, we can also see the distinction between the great and the mediocre. The mediocre devote their lives to their own private interests, so what they leave behind is huge wealth, while the great devote themselves to the great cause of the masses, and their legacy is therefore a contribution to mankind and a construction of the world. Therefore, the estate of 40,000 US dollars (if the annual interest of his mother's inheritance is deducted, it will be far less than this amount) is not worth mentioning. For Roosevelt, there is a greater legacy.

This legacy is the contribution to mankind and the contribution to the world that we praise. In this century, we feel that World War II has produced two glorious results. One is national self-determination, which is the achievement of President Wilson in 1919, and the other is economic Democracy, the foresight of President Roosevelt. Using economic democracy to stabilize the world is Roosevelt's cause, and it is also the great cause he has left to this world. As for the previous promotion of international unity, in today's chaotic international situation, we feel Roosevelt's greatness even more.

It is truly economic Democracy, so the wealth Roosevelt left behind is only at the tail end of the 60 richest families in the United States. It is truly because he is a figure of an era, so what he has left to this world is a cause of promoting stability, peace, and prosperity. This cause has more necessity and value than a sum of wealth.

Talking about Hu Zhantang Xu Ren

Revolutionary veteran Hu Zhantang has been dead for eleven years, making people have infinite nostalgia for this great politician.

Mr.'s name is "Hanmin", because when the Manchu Qing Dynasty was coming to an end, Mr. was following the father of the country to engage in revolution. He thought that the Manchu Qing were Huren, and his own surname happened to be "Hu", which he regarded as a shameful thing, but the surname could not be changed, so he named himself "Hanmin", indicating that he was a son of the Han family:

When he was the President of the Legislative Yuan, the capital and Shanghai were close to each other. Every Saturday, the important people of the capital went to Shanghai for a short rest, which had become a habit. At that time, it was called "weekend travel" in public opinion. Only Hu Guangsheng had never been to Shanghai in the five or six years after the capital of the National Government was established in Nanjing. It was not until the 20th year when he went to Guangdong via Shanghai to resolve the war that he went to Shanghai for the first time after the capital was established, and it was also the last time he went to Shanghai, because he died in Guangzhou afterwards.

He hated the existence of colonial-style foreign concessions in the big cities of China. Therefore, his footsteps never set foot in the concession in his life. This and Wu Peifu's creed of "not living in the concession after failure" echoed each other.

A certain wife bought a pair of foreign silk machines for thirty yuan, which was a very extravagant behavior under the price at the time. When Mr. Hu found out about it, he specially raised this matter at the Central Memorial Week and severely rebuked her. It was once spread as a good story.

Mr. Hu and Wang Jingwei were both veterans of the Kuomintang, but there was no harmony between Hu and Wang. Mr. Hu always despised Wang's personality. In the 20th year, Mr. Hu went to Guangdong from the capital, passing through Shanghai. Wang Jingwei happened to return to Shanghai from abroad. Hu and Wang, who had been separated for several years, shook hands and met; after Wang said goodbye and left, Mr. Hu hurriedly called people to fetch a basin of water to wash his hands, saying, "It has soiled my hands"! Wang Jingwei later surrendered to Japan and became a traitor, which proves that Mr. Hu's knowledge of people is not false.

The four elders of the National Government are all known by their courtesy names, namely Hu Zhantang, Yu Youren, Tan Yankai, and Niu Yongjian. Their calligraphy styles are different. Hu's calligraphy is thin, tall and upright, with hard bones and ridges. The characters are like the person. Seeing his characters will remind you of his integrity in doing things.

Using this method of coaxing in every way, Old Zhu spent another hour with her like years. He finally hoped that the train would stop at a very small station called Kansai. Many of the stronger passengers jumped off the train one after another to walk and rest. Although Zhu Zhaonian knew very well the value of this horizontal wood like a tree branch, it might be snatched by others if he left, but for Feifei's illness, he felt that he had to quickly take her down to breathe some fresh air. At the same time, he also wanted to find several companions in the group who had some medical knowledge to see what kind of illness the child was suffering from, and whether she would also be infected with typhus like her mother?

He resolutely got off the train. At this time, the group member surnamed Feng had brought a bowl of boiling water. Old Zhu held Feifei and first sat down on the platform without a canopy. While telling him to put the boiling water aside, he asked him to quickly find those group members who knew some medicine.

Now, Feifei is just drowsy, and her palms and forehead are a little hot. Old Zhu also knows that this is definitely not a minor illness, but besides trying to pour boiling water for her to drink, he can't think of any good way for a while. Kansai is just a very,

### Bao Feng Money Exchange Allegedly Defrauded, Large Loss of Gold and US Dollars ·Military and Police Authorities Decide to Immediately Send Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly·

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yesterday, rumors spread throughout the money exchange industry that four men, each carrying a handgun, came to the Bao Feng Money Exchange at 204 Nanjing East Road. They claimed to be under orders to search for illegal gold and dollar transactions. After showing their identification, they entered the exchange's inner room and took away eight large gold bars, over one thousand US dollars, and some account books and checkbooks. They also intended to take the manager, Liu Ji, away, but after Liu pleaded, they left with the money in a pre-arranged car heading east. When a reporter went to the exchange yesterday to inquire, Liu was out. An apprentice at the exchange revealed that the amount lost was not as large as rumored. When asked, the exchange's staff all denied the incident. The reporter also inquired with Xu Youzuo, the chief of the police bureau's economic division, and the inspection office of the garrison command, who both stated that they had heard of the incident, but no personnel had been dispatched to the aforementioned location for a search today (i.e., yesterday).

### Funding for Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Superhighway Still Not Secured

[Reported by Our Newspaper] According to a spokesperson for the Shanghai Office of the Highway Administration, the main task since the establishment of this office has been to receive equipment from the Executive Headquarters. Although much has been received over the past year, most of the machinery is incomplete and cannot be assembled and used, and is currently stored in Zhenru. The planned Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Superhighway has not yet started due to a lack of funding. The Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, which has been repaired and opened to traffic, is again full of potholes, but due to a lack of funds for repairs, it is being left to nature.

### Engine Failed Twice, Crew Did Not Recognize Flag Signals, Struggled in the Storm for Hours Before Finally Sinking, Passengers of the Da Feng Vessel Give Detailed Account

[Special Dispatch from Nantong, 12th] The Da Feng steamship sailed from Shanghai on the 8th and encountered a tragic accident after being attacked by strong winds and huge waves. Yesterday, a rescued passenger told our reporter in detail about what happened. According to him, "The Da Feng vessel had been in disrepair for a long time, the interior was dilapidated, many of the parts were incomplete, and the cabins often leaked water. After departing from Shanghai at 11 p.m. on the 8th, it was discovered that the piston in the engine had been damaged when it arrived at Lion Grove at 2:20 a.m. on the 9th, and it immediately dropped anchor and stopped moving forward. Then, at around 5 a.m., it was suddenly attacked by a violent storm and waves, and the ship body shook violently, causing all the passengers to vomit continuously. At that time, some of the passengers requested to return to Shanghai, but the ship owner refused. Around 8 a.m., the situation became even worse, and a large amount of river water flowed into the ship, and the ship's bottom pump also broke down. After repairs, it sailed back to Wusong. After sailing for about half an hour, the ship's engine failed again. At that time, the captain, seeing the critical situation, urgently telegraphed the company in Shanghai for help. It was about 9 o'clock, the ship's body was tilting, and the passengers were shouting loudly, causing chaos. Until 11 a.m., an oil tanker numbered 128 approached the area and saw that the situation of the Da Feng vessel was critical, so it signaled with flags. However, no one on the Da Feng vessel recognized the flag signals, so they could not reply, and only hung the flag upside down to indicate an emergency. At 12:05 p.m., they received a reply from the company saying that two large water boats had been sent to rescue them. However, they had not arrived by 1:10 p.m., and the Da Feng vessel could no longer hold on, and the ship's body gradually sank, and the passengers all crawled from the bottom to the top of the ship, and the situation was extremely dangerous. At 1:30, the ship tilted to the left, and all the crew members were already wearing life jackets, and some of the passengers had already sunk into the water. I wore an extra life jacket and knew how to swim a little, so I was spared from disaster. After struggling for a while, I saw a rescue boat on the river surface approaching quickly. The boat was the oil tanker numbered 128, but before the oil tanker arrived, the Da Feng vessel had completely sunk, and the scene of the passengers sinking was too horrible to look at. When the oil tanker arrived, I was fortunate enough to be rescued first, but because I struggled in the water for too long and exerted too much effort, I vomited blood after getting on the boat, and later returned to Shanghai for medical treatment. As far as I know, there were 50 soldiers on board in addition to ordinary passengers who had not purchased tickets. In addition to those who were rescued, the number of victims must be over one hundred. Among those rescued, nine more died."

Families of Victims Schedule Meeting to Discuss Aftermath

At the same time, over 20 family members of the passengers also went on the vessel to identify the bodies.

### The Yamazaki Hotel Bloodbath Behind the Scenes ··Seemingly a Page from a Spy History

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Wu Wen, the protagonist of the Yamazaki Hotel bloodbath, which was a sensation during the enemy-puppet period, was on trial yesterday in the Ordinary Criminal Court of the High Court. Wu's confession of the details was as follows: He is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, a doctor of Western medicine, and had studied in the United States and Japan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as a commissioner in the Nanjing District of the Allied Military Intelligence Service. In the 31st year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1942], he practiced medicine in Nanjing under the guise of a sign to cover his activities. He met a woman named Cao Xiuzhen (i.e., the deceased). Cao was once married to a Chen, so she was also known as Chen, and she had been his student when she was young. Because Cao's husband had passed away and he was also widowed, they developed a relationship from teacher and student to cohabitation. Cao had a mark like a lotus petal. At that time, she was working as a spy for the enemy [Japanese] organization, which had offered a reward of 200,000 yuan for the arrest of Allied underground workers. Unexpectedly, Cao, blinded by profit, wanted to sell out her underground comrades. In October of the 32nd year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1943], the two came to Shanghai and rented a room in the Yamazaki Hotel in Hongkou. Cao did not listen to his advice, and the two had a dispute. He first covered Cao's mouth with a cloth, and then strangled her with a bathrobe belt. He also said that his motive for killing Cao was purely to protect national military secrets. After the case occurred, Wu was sentenced to death by the District Court, and the puppet High Court changed the sentence to life imprisonment. Later, the puppet government granted amnesty and reduced the sentence to fifteen years. After the victory, the High Prosecutor's Office re-investigated and prosecuted him for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. The case was concluded by the High Court yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced at 2 p.m. on the 19th.
