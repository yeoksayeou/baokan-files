Hu Shih Discusses Two Types of Political Parties
The Chinese Communist Party and the Nazis Belong to the Second Type
The Government's Full-Scale Suppression of the Rebellion is Inevitable

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 5th] After the issuance of the Mobilization Order for the Suppression of Rebellion, this reporter visited Hu Shih today to inquire about his thoughts. Hu, busy with university affairs, had not yet had time to read the newspaper. After the reporter informed him of the main points of the Suppression of Rebellion Order, Hu said that the government's suppression of the communists was a fait accompli, and the issuance of this Mobilization Order for the Suppression of Rebellion clearly indicates the government's attitude. Since the Chinese Communist Party is using all its strength to overthrow the government, it is conceivable that the government will use all its strength to suppress the communists. As for how international forces will influence the government's actions, the most important thing now is how the mobilization for the suppression of rebellion will develop. Hu added, "My hometown of Jixi was completely undamaged during the eight years of the War of Resistance, and it can be called a paradise. Three days after the communist army arrived after the victory, they completely destroyed Jixi. Therefore, I believe that President Chiang's statement at the Political Consultative Conference that he was deeply saddened by the internal strife that occurred after the victory was heartfelt. Even those in the planning community are saddened that China, after joining the ranks of the victorious Four Great Powers, has suffered such a calamity." Hu also discussed the two different types of political parties in the world in relation to the Chinese problem, saying that there are type A political parties like those in Britain and the United States, which compete for votes through peaceful means and regard voter support as the standard for advancement or retreat. There are also type B political parties like those in Eastern and Southern Europe, such as the Fascists, Nazis, and the Chinese Communist Party. These parties maintain their power by any means necessary. The Kuomintang was originally a type A political party, but it was greatly influenced by the Soviet Union in 1924 and reorganized into a type B political party. However, Sun Yat-sen still retained a fondness for Anglo-American democracy, so he decided to use political tutelage as a bridge, ultimately transitioning to constitutionalism. The Kuomintang is now moving from a type B political party back towards a type A political party, but the speed still needs to be increased." Today marks the one-year anniversary of Hu's return to the country. When asked about his feelings, Hu replied that returning to the country was like being a primary school student, and he has not yet graduated from primary school.

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 5th] Mei Yi-qi, President of Tsinghua University, told reporters: The government's issuance of the Mobilization Order for the Suppression of Rebellion can be seen as a demonstration of the government's determination. After the Mobilization Order is issued, it is unclear whether everything will be converted to a wartime system, but in any case, I believe that the government will continue to protect education, as the government never neglected education even during the extremely difficult War of Resistance. This reporter also visited Lu Zhiwei, acting president of Yenching University, who expressed great concern about the current situation and was also concerned about the issue of the Tianjin University campus being occupied.

Soviet Ships Operating Off the Coast of Shandong
Naval Authorities Are Closely Monitoring

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet expressed anything on this matter. It is generally believed that the Soviet side has not yet responded to our statement regarding Lushun-Dalian. After Molotov returns to the country from Paris, there may be a response. At that time, the Soviet attitude towards China may be clarified.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense did not confirm the Soviet military occupation of Tacheng, only stating that Soviet troops had advanced towards Tacheng in early June, but there have been no further reports.

Implementing Mobilization and Strengthening Military Affairs
Relies on Thoroughly Reforming Politics
Zhang Junmai Discusses the National General Mobilization Proposal

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, expressed his opinion on the State Council's passage of the General Mobilization Proposal yesterday, stating that the hoped-for results can only be achieved if politics are thoroughly reformed. Whether strengthening grain administration, conscription, or military strength, a clear and honest government must be the foundation, otherwise it will be difficult to see results. Judging from the current situation in various places, the powers and responsibilities of the central and local governments are unclear, and local administrative expenses and personnel are all subject to central control, to the point that local governments have no possibility of independent action. Taking his hometown of Shishan as an example, there are as many as 36 agencies with the power to direct the county magistrate, so the reform of provincial government is the most urgent task.

People From the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party
Support the General Mobilization Proposal

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] After the State Council passed the National General Mobilization Plan on the 4th, Yu Jiaju, Chen Qitian of the China Youth Party, and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party issued their opinions to the press. Yu stated: "We have always believed that the Chinese Communist Party is a violent group with no concept of the nation, and it is fundamentally impossible to cooperate with them to jointly engage in national construction. Therefore, in order to achieve national stability and peace as soon as possible, we should strengthen the military suppression of the communists." Chen Qitian said: "We fully support this important measure of the government." Jiang Yuntian instructed that the General Mobilization Plan should be earnestly implemented, and said, "We strongly support the suppression of the communist rebellion."

The Implementation of the Mobilization Plan
Must Be Fair and Reasonable
Tao Baichuan Offers Three Points

[This Newspaper Dispatch] When this reporter inquired of Shanghai City Councilor Tao Baichuan about the General Mobilization Plan, he replied: "Regarding the National General Mobilization, I would like to offer three points for consideration:

First, the targets of the General Mobilization are manpower, materials, and financial resources, and its purpose is to truly achieve 'those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength' in order to seek military victory in suppressing the communists and the completion of democratic nation-building. To achieve this goal, we must first focus on organization and control, that is, strengthen the organization and control of the nation's manpower, materials, and financial resources. This is the government's responsibility, so the government must be capable and have the support of the people in order to proceed smoothly. Therefore, improving administrative efficiency and correcting political corruption in order to enhance capability and win the support of the people should be the key to the success or failure of this mobilization, and it is also the issue that the government should pay the most attention to. Because the State Council's proposal did not pay attention to this premise, I am specifically raising it.

Second, given the disorganization of our country's manpower, materials, and financial resources, coupled with the fact that the government's machinery is unsound and it is difficult to expect it to be sound in the short term, in order to achieve the success of the General Mobilization, we must also rely on social forces. Therefore, the government should immediately mobilize social elites to work together. For example, the newly established Social Security Promotion Association in this city will definitely be helpful for the mobilization work in this city in the future, and this can be done in other places as well.

Third, in addition to the above two items, we must also pay attention to fairness and reasonableness in order to achieve the success of the mobilization. If those with strength can avoid contributing strength, while those without strength are forced to contribute strength, and those with money can avoid contributing money, while those without money are forced to contribute money, judging from the current situation, unfortunately, this often happens. Then, not only will the mobilization fail, but it will also drive the fish into the deep, causing them to see the benefit and suffer the harm first. In recent events, the Social Security Promotion Association of this city invited various sectors yesterday to contribute to the Dragon Boat Festival慰勞軍墊款, and of the 92 invitees, 50 people attended and collected more than 2.6 billion yuan, which shows that the people's hearts are still good and things can still be done. However, some rich people simply ignored it. For these rich people, we must continue to urge them to donate in order to conform to the principle of fairness and reasonableness."

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 5th] After the State Council passed the General Mobilization Plan, all sectors of the provincial capital expressed their support. More than ten groups, including the Jiangsu Provincial Journalists Association and the Youth Rights Protection and Patriotic Movement, sent a special telegram to the central government on the 5th, vowing to use all their strength to support the government.

Standing Committee of the China Democratic League Expresses
That It Is Not United With the Chinese Communist Party

[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Standing Committee of the China Democratic League expressed its opinion on the government's passage of the Mobilization Order, stating: If the government can build democracy and unite with educated youth at the present time, the effect will be better than the Mobilization Order. We have always advocated using our country's internal peace to seek world peace. The China Democratic League's position is absolutely neutral and absolutely fair. Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, it does not lean towards either side. "If the China Democratic League were to unite with the Chinese Communist Party after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party split, it would inevitably create a more divided situation in China," but the China Democratic League has not taken this action. Its past sincere efforts to plan for the country can be made clear to the world. The China Democratic League headquarters is currently located in Nanjing, with Xin Bojun and Luo Longji stationed there for the long term. Luo has gone to Nanjing. Xin is scheduled to go around the 10th of this month. The government has allocated housing, which is very "polite." It is hoped that this kind of courtesy can be extended to all places.

[This Newspaper, Yanzhou, 5th] The center of gravity of the battle situation in Shandong has shifted south to the central area of Meng, Fei, Yi, Ju, and Tangtou, Huandun. The Communist army in that area, totaling eight columns, approximately 180,000 people, has been surrounded separately in four encirclements by the National Army. From the 3rd to the 5th, the truly decisive battles of the main forces are proceeding fiercely.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 5th] After the National Army formally recovered Linqu and Nanma, the two major supply bases of the Communist army in central Shandong, the communist bandits east of Donglidian in Yishui and in the southeastern area of Mengyin fell into a pocket-shaped formation, and the transportation and supply route stretching hundreds of miles from Huimin and Liji on the north bank of the Yellow River to the mountainous area of central Shandong has been cut off. The National Army completely recovered Donglidian at noon on the 5th and then controlled the Yue Zhuang stronghold. Thus, the headquarters of the East China Field Army of the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains has been destroyed. At present, another supply line bottleneck in the hands of the communist bandits in Shandong is Zhucheng, east of Yishui.

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The Communist army's offensive in western Shandong has begun to falter.

Elite units of the National Army have rushed to block and attack them.

The "Devil King" of No. 76,
Ding Mocun, Executed Yesterday
Pale and Incoherent Before Execution

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The "devil king" of No. 76, traitor Ding Mocun, was executed according to national law at 3:15 PM on the 5th. This executioner, who murdered like a butcher, was already pale and incoherent before the execution. After entering the execution ground, in the last second, he still looked back with cowardice, as if he had endless attachment to the world. With one shot of ten bullets by the bailiff, his despicable life was ended. The sky was dark, the air pressure was extremely low, and thunder rumbled across the sky, forming a magnificent symphony with the enthusiastic applause of the audience at the scene. Heaven and man were both indignant, which is indeed true.

Death Arrives Suddenly Before Afternoon Nap

The execution order for traitor Ding was delivered to the Capital High Court on the morning of the 5th. Supervisor of Execution Prosecutor Chen Shengzu and others arrived at the Tiger Bridge Capital Prison to inspect the execution ground at around 1:40 PM. They then set up a temporary court at around 2:00 PM and signed the order to bring traitor Ding in. When the warrant arrived at the prison, traitor Ding did not know that death was imminent and was still taking his usual afternoon nap with a pillow. Awakened in a daze by the summons, he hurriedly got up, his eyes still sleepy, and walked out of the prison gate. After leaving the prison, he saw a crowd of reporters gathering and taking photos of him. Police officers with guns and live ammunition stood guard strictly. Only then did he realize that his death was imminent, his face changed suddenly, and he frequently looked left and right. His pace also gradually became difficult. Relying on the support of the bailiff, he entered the court.

Excessive Nervousness, Pale Face

Traitor Ding was wearing a light gray old plaid cotton short shirt and pants, black shoes and white socks, and his collar was slightly exposed. His eyes were completely lifeless. His anemic face, due to excessive tension, became even paler, and his lips had no color at all. After standing still, Prosecutor Chen first asked his age and native place. At this time, traitor Ding was already mentally confused and did not seem to hear. He responded vaguely, and the reporter, sitting only three or four steps away from traitor Ding, could only hear a faint "um" sound, which was barely discernible. Prosecutor Chen then informed him of the circumstances of the rejection of the appeal and the rejection of the protest. Traitor Ding listened quietly, swallowing his saliva from time to time. When he heard that he was ordered to be executed today, he clenched his upper and lower teeth, trying hard to support himself. However, due to his excessive tension, he was speechless for a moment, and the atmosphere in the entire court became even more solemn.

Forced Smile, Refuses to Speak

After about 30 seconds, the prosecutor ordered him to speak again and advised him to calm down. Traitor Ding then made a wry smile, first bowed his head and thought for a few seconds, then said in his Hunan accent, "I have no last words!" The bailiff asked him if he had a will. Traitor Ding replied, "It's too late to write one!" Prosecutor Chen said, "You need to calm down a bit. If you don't feel like writing, you can say it orally, and the clerk can write it down for you." Traitor Ding only answered with an "um" sound, not indicating whether he agreed or not, and raised his head to look at the ceiling as if in deep thought. After repeated urging, he lowered his head, smiled bitterly, and replied: "I have nothing to say. It will be difficult for my family after my death. I can only let them be!" Prosecutor Chen said, "The state will make a fair decision regarding your family's living expenses. Now the time has come. Do you have any last words for your wife, children, mother, or friends? Say it quickly! 一

妄女謬論
法官嚴斥

At this point, Ding closed his eyes and thought quietly, for another few seconds. The room was extremely quiet, and only the sound of thunder could be heard outside. After Ding opened his eyes, as if he had seen the light, he frowned and smiled wickedly, first saying: "Regarding the case itself, things have come to this point. I have nothing to say, but I hope that the state can deal with general traitor cases leniently!" Then he repeated it again, and then 獰笑. Prosecutor Chen, upon hearing this, sternly rebuked him, explaining that the area of France is not as large as Sichuan Province in our country, and they have executed 80,000 French traitors, including 7,000 who were sentenced to death. Our country is still lenient towards the Japanese, and it cannot be said that we are not lenient towards traitor cases. After speaking, he asked again if he had any last words for his family and others? Traitor Ding thought hard for a while and still replied: "Nothing!" The prosecutor immediately 令押出. After entering the execution ground, after walking about ten steps, the bailiff told him "Don't move!" Traitor Ding was just turning his head when the gunshot rang out, and the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his eyebrow. This great traitor fell to the ground in the applause of the audience. His body was curled up in a bow shape, almost reaching his chest, and his feet twitched. He finally died after about two minutes, at 2:17 PM. A reporter rushed forward to take a closer look one minute after the execution. Traitor Ding was lying in a pool of blood, foam was still coming from his mouth, and his face was covered in blood. His hideous face could no longer be distinguished. (Above) Ding Mocun undergoing his final interrogation. (Below) Ding Mocun lying in a pool of blood after his execution. (Photographed by Yu Peiqing of this newspaper)

National Assembly Delegate and Legislative Committee Elections
Government Has Absolutely No Intention of Delaying
Hong Lanyou Discusses the Implementation of National Election Affairs Step by Step

[This City Dispatch] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association and member of the Election General Office, came to Shanghai on business. This reporter happened to meet him and asked how the general elections for the National Assembly delegates and legislative committee members would proceed this year, and inquired whether the rumors of delays or the inability to hold them on schedule were true. Hong replied: "The formulation of the constitution, the determination of the preparatory procedures for the implementation of constitutionalism, and the decision to convene the National Assembly on December 25th of this year to implement constitutionalism were all resolved by the National Assembly last year. This is not only a necessary path to completing democratic politics, but also the common wish of the people of the whole country. Therefore, in terms of legal principles and facts, there is no room for change, and there should be no doubts about the date of constitutional implementation. The government has formulated various constitutional laws and regulations in accordance with the deadlines stipulated in the preparatory procedures for the implementation of constitutionalism, and at the same time organized the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee to be responsible for promoting constitutional work. Recently, it has also established election agencies in accordance with the law and held meetings of the election committee many times. In yesterday's State Council meeting, President Chiang's proposal also included a command to realize constitutionalism on schedule. This truly shows the government's determination to implement constitutionalism in accordance with the procedures for the implementation of constitutionalism. There is absolutely no consideration of delaying it. There is a portion of the outside world that believes that the areas occupied by the Communist Party's military forces have not yet been recovered, which hinders the election process, resulting in speculation about the government's decision to hold general elections on schedule. They do not know that suppressing the communists and implementing constitutionalism are proceeding in parallel and without contradiction. Implementing constitutionalism is the task of the country to achieve nation-building, and suppressing the communists can eliminate the obstacles to nation-building. Moreover, most areas are now able to conduct elections in accordance with regulations, and the election affairs can be expanded at any time as the bandits are gradually eliminated, and the national election affairs can be completed by implementing them step by step in accordance with the implementation procedures. There is truly no need to doubt it."

Ancient Shang Dynasty Artifacts Discovered in the Half-Mang Mountain Area of Luoyang
Bronze Gui Weighs Approximately Twenty Jin

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 5th] Ancient Shang Dynasty artifacts were discovered in the Half-Mang Mountain area of Luoyang. When villagers were selling them to antique dealers for a large sum of 80 million yuan, the police station cracked the case and seized the most valuable Shang Dynasty bronze 　, weighing approximately twenty jin.

"I for Everyone, Everyone for Me" Celebrating International Cooperative Day Mayor Encourages Spirit of Cooperation [Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the 25th International Cooperative Day. Relevant circles in this city held a celebration meeting at 2 PM at the Shanghai Pudong Native Place Association on Zhongzheng Middle Road. Over 200 leaders from various circles, including Mayor Wu, Director Fang, and Director Li of the Social Affairs Bureau, as well as representatives from various cooperative societies, attended. The meeting venue also featured an exhibition of towel products from the Chuansha Nanhui Cooperative Society. The meeting was chaired by Mayor Wu. After performing the formalities, the Mayor delivered a speech, briefly stating that the meaning of cooperation is "I for everyone, everyone for me." If cooperative enterprises can be promoted, corrupt officials and profiteers can be eliminated, and society can be stabilized. Although there are many difficulties in promoting consumer cooperation in Shanghai at present, we must not retreat in the face of difficulties, but must strive to improve cooperation in order to achieve social welfare. Recently, both domestically and internationally, a few people have placed individual interests above national and ethnic interests, or national interests above world interests. Those who disregard the interests of the majority of the people must be overthrown. Whether internationally or domestically, we should uphold justice and seek stability and happiness with a democratic spirit of cooperation. Director Fang then delivered a speech stating that cooperative movement was one of the seven movements promoted by the Party in 1930 and has since achieved considerable results. At this time of economic panic, it is even more necessary to strengthen the cooperative movement. Our country especially needs spiritual cooperation, the so-called "I for everyone," does not necessarily mean "everyone for me," but the Communist Party only seeks "everyone for me" and does not mention cooperation at all, so it must be eliminated. International cooperation should also be based on spiritual cooperation in order to achieve the ideal of Great Harmony. Li Jianhua, Chen Zhongming, and others then gave speeches. After the speeches, the assembly's declaration was read, and a telegram to President Chiang was approved. Finally, entertainment began, and the meeting concluded in joy at around 5 PM.

Four Industries Solve Disputes, Another Wave Rises at Hua Aluminum [Our Newspaper's Report] The Hua Aluminum Steel Refinement Factory, originally scheduled to resume work tomorrow, experienced another setback between labor and management yesterday.

### Gold Rush Case Scheduled for Sentencing on the 12th Yang Anren and Lin Fengbao Released on Original Bail Zhan Liansheng's Request for Bail Denied and Still Detained [Our Newspaper's Report] The gold speculation case, which caused a sensation in society, was concluded yesterday in the Eighth Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Wang Jiazhuo. In addition to the defendants Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng, Li Xiaozhuang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the National Bank, and Wang Songtao, former Assistant Manager of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, were summoned as witnesses. After the court hearing, the debate concluded, and the court announced that the case would be sentenced on the 12th of this month. At 9:30 AM yesterday, Judge Wang, accompanied by Clerk Feng Duanxiang, ascended the bench and announced to the defendants that the statutory time limit for the case had been exceeded by 15 days, and the trial would be renewed according to the law. Then, Clerk Feng read aloud the transcript of the examination of witness Li Xiaozhuang on May 24, and then conducted individual interrogations. Wang Songtao testified: "Regarding the remittance situation of Cifengyu after the National Bank allocated gold, because the collection time was too late that day and the time for exchanging bills had passed, it was included in the account on the second day. There were a total of three secret sales, all of which were reported to Yang Anren in advance. From January to February of this year, Cifengyu sometimes sent people to collect the allocated gold, and sometimes Zhan Shusheng came to collect it himself." Lin Fengbao testified: "The bill exchange deadline is 1:00 PM. After 1:00 PM, application forms can be exchanged until 3:00 PM. Because the time was too tight, sometimes there was not enough time to transfer the account. As for the allocation and sale of 600 million yuan of gold on January 16, 700 million yuan of gold on January 30, and as much as 2.5 billion yuan of gold on February 8, it was probably because there were more transactions on Saturdays. At that time, I didn't know it was the last day of gold allocation. I only knew after the order arrived." Yang Anren testified: "On January 27, the National Bank secretly sold 1,820 bars, and another 1,000 bars were sold the next day. As for the delivery the next day, it was because afternoon transactions should be transferred the next day, and the bill exchange time had passed. There was a separate transfer form application. On February 8, the sales reached as much as 2.5338 billion yuan because it was Saturday. The secret sales used intercoms, and Zhan Liansheng represented the association to apply for the open allocation." Zhan Liansheng testified: "Of the 1,820 bars secretly sold by the National Bank, Cifengyu purchased 800 bars on its account. The other 1,000 bars were sold in the afternoon. As for why the most was bought on February 8, I didn't know because I didn't go to the store that day. I was designated by President Bei as the representative for the open allocation of gold. All the matters I handled were traceable and there was no wrongdoing." After the interrogation, the court announced the scheduled sentencing date. The bail for the two defendants, Lin and Yang, remained unchanged, and Zhan Liansheng's request for bail was denied and he was still detained.

There are three parties in society responsible for construction undertakings: (1) Competent authorities—responsible for promotion. (2) Schools—responsible for training talents. (3) Construction industry—responsible for execution. Therefore, the construction industry is one of the three pillars, and its importance can be seen from this. The following four points were discussed together during the talks: (1) The Public Works Bureau occasionally discovers construction without permits. It is hoped that no such illegal construction will be discovered in the future. (2) Most of the current building materials do not meet standards, which has a great impact on housing construction. In the future, the Public Works Bureau will strengthen the management of various building materials and will conduct registration work for woodworking operations in order to pre-test Gu Zhong materials. (3) The contract method has to be studied and improved due to the impact of rising prices. The interests of both parties will be taken into account when formulating new methods, and the rights of construction companies will be guaranteed. (4) The Public Works Bureau has tried its best to shorten the time for obtaining permits, and the fastest can be obtained within six days. If there are any deliberate delays, you can report them to the authorities. The atmosphere of the talks was very harmonious.

Two Customs Officers Accused The Case is Being Handled as Slander [Our Newspaper's Report] He Weiku, a super-grade second-class inspector of the Jianghai Customs and Wusong Customs, and Zhu Xiaoliang, a second-class deputy inspector, were secretly reported to the General Administration of Customs by Chen Fengnian, the manager of Chen Fuhua Customs Brokerage at No. 60, Wusong Xing Road, for extorting 6 million yuan by taking advantage of their official duties. The Jianghai Customs sent them to the District Court for trial on special criminal charges of "corruption." The case was tried yesterday in the Third Criminal Court by Judge Wu. According to the defendants' claim: Because they are responsible for inspection and verification, they may offend the customs brokerage. This time, Chen invited Zhu Xiaoliang to go and instructed him to bring a luggage [omitted due to uncertainty] to the clerk of the brokerage on the way back to Shanghai. At that time, he did not suspect anything else and did not open it to see what was inside. Therefore, it was actually a frame-up to avenge private grievances. After the court hearing, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned.

Essays and Miscellany: Seeking Truth Through Nature - Jiang Weiqiao

My late elder brother, Kezhuang, excelled in calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy. Therefore, I have enjoyed looking at paintings since childhood, but I cannot create them myself. I always find ways to collect the works of contemporary masters, and I especially love the realistic paintings of Master Yu Jianhua. I remember in the summer of 1932, I planned to travel to Mount Hua, but it was difficult to find companions with the stamina for the journey. Eventually, I went with Master Yu and his disciple Xu Peiji, entering Tongguan, ascending to the summit of Mount Taihua, and traversing dangerous terrains such as Qianchi Dong, Baichi Xia, Canglong Ling, Yaozi Fanshen, and Changkong Zhan. Master Yu, always carrying a plain notebook and inkstone, sketched from life wherever he went. He meticulously depicted strange peaks, bizarre rocks, flying waterfalls, and flowing springs, capturing their essence in detail. He paid particular attention to the ever-changing clouds and the light of dawn and dusk. In three days on Mount Hua, the master and disciple each created several albums of paintings, entitled "Hua Shan Sketches and Travel Records."

I believe that the term "sketches from life" is not entirely appropriate. The name originated with Zhao Chang of the Song Dynasty, who excelled in painting flowers, capturing their natural appearance in the wind and dew. Therefore, he called himself "Zhao Chang, the Sketcher from Life." In modern times, as Western painting spread eastward, any painting that depicted objects from reality, whether figures, flowers, still lifes, or landscapes, was generally called "sketches from life." However, Western painting is called "Sketchers From Nature," which seems more fitting. Chinese landscape painting depicts mountains, ancient trees, and flowing springs, with nothing inherently "alive" about them. In my opinion, it should be renamed "Landscape Painting," while "sketches from life" should refer to paintings of figures and flowers. The word "jing" (scene) was already listed as one of the six essentials by Jing Hao in the Five Dynasties period, and Guo Xi of the Song Dynasty elaborated on it further. Western painting calls landscapes "scenery," so using the term "Landscape Painting" to describe paintings of real-life scenery is appropriate for both Chinese and Western art. I once told Master Yu about this idea, and he quite agreed with me. Now, as Master Yu is about to publicly exhibit his landscape paintings, I write these words to discuss with fellow artists.

### Leonardo da Vinci's Childhood - Xu Fan

Near the city of Florence in Italy, lies a cluster of Tuscaye mountains embraced by Lake Arno, covered in kudzu vines. Nestled among them is the sleepy village of Vinci. On the rocky peaks surrounding the village stand ancient fortresses and ramparts. Among the vines on the mountains grow silver-gray olive trees. Everywhere, towering cypress trees stand tall, their dark green forms reaching towards the bright Italian sky.

In the early 15th century, a man named Serpiero lived in this small village of Vinci. He was a lawyer, inheriting the profession from his grandfather. No one ever heard of any cases involving him or his family, except in 1452, when Serpiero fathered an illegitimate child, named Leonardo De Vinci.

Almost nothing is known about Leonardo da Vinci's mother. It is said that she was a country girl named Catourir, who raised the beautiful child on her own until he was five years old, when she handed him over to his father, Serpiero. During this time, she married a coarse farmer and lived a life of toil and poverty.

Around the same time as Leonardo's birth, Serpiero also married to secure his family's future. They had no children, so they brought Leonardo into their home as their own. Soon after, his wife died, and Serpiero married a second wife, but still had no children. Therefore, when Leonardo was twenty-five years old, he became his father's only child, and all the family's hopes and warmth were focused on him.

Leonardo was a beautiful child, with a deep love for beauty. He was constantly seeking it out. He loved to watch birds taking flight from the ground or from the surrounding trees, soaring through the bright blue sky. He collected beautiful flowers and carefully studied their structure. His singing voice was sweet and moving, and he could play a six-stringed lute. He admired horses and was able to ride them at a young age.

Regardless, he always listened attentively to his teachers, but his inquisitive mind went far beyond their limited knowledge. A biographer of his early years wrote: "In arithmetic, he often failed to find satisfactory answers, and his teachers were constantly challenged by the difficult theories and explanations he posed."

As a child, Leonardo played in the bright sunshine or under the kudzu vines and olive trees, happily breathing in the fragrance of grapes, wild roses, and almonds. As his legs grew stronger, he went to play by the rivers and lakes, watching the dancing water ripples. Indeed, the water ripples seemed to fascinate Leonardo, and his youthful curiosity drove him to experiment and study these natural changes.

When the young Leonardo's fingers could grasp a pencil or a piece of chalk, he began to draw everything he saw. He drew lakes, cliffs, birds, flowers, and people... Indeed, the interests of some successful painters in their childhood can foreshadow their future, as Serpiero was familiar with many painters.

Once, Serpiero moved to Florence and, upon arrival, was overjoyed to visit his friend Yerocchio. Yerocchio was deeply impressed by the child's early works and warmly welcomed the promising young man to his studio to study. From then on, Leonardo officially entered the world of painting, beginning his great artistic life.

### A Century of Chinese Painting - Lu Danlin

Is there anything in the universe that remains fixed and unchanging? "Ten years bring many changes in human affairs," everything is constantly in flux. Looking back over the past century, China has undergone dramatic transformations in politics, military affairs, culture, and economics. The changes in art are even more evident. Although the style of Chinese art began to shift after Buddhism entered China, and Western art came in during the late Ming Dynasty with the arrival of Catholicism, Chinese painting was once again greatly influenced by the influx of Western culture and art during the mid-Qing Dynasty. Soon, the maritime ban was lifted, and European and American culture and art flooded in like a raging tide. As a result, China's culture, art, politics, and the lives of its people all experienced tremendous upheaval.

After the rise of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Qing Dynasty's paper tiger was exposed, and internal and external troubles came one after another like a revolving lantern. Although the number of painters did not decrease, the style of painting gradually changed drastically. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, the Qing government became even more corrupt, and many painters sold their works in Shanghai to make a living. Some had to cater to the tastes of customers in order to earn money, and as a result, the quality of their work inevitably declined into vulgarity.

During this period, Ren Xiong and his disciples, although skilled in using the "gouge and outline" technique, could not escape the crude and rough air in their style. They retained only the name of the technique, losing the essence of Huang Quan's style. Wu Changshuo rose up as an unconventional force, incorporating the brushwork of seal script and clerical script into his paintings. Wang Zhen was unrestrained, vigorous, ancient, and profound, full of the spirit of metal and stone, creating a unique style. However, in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, as Western painting gradually spread, several different phenomena occurred in the art world. Roughly speaking, they can be divided into four categories: First, some painters still tried their best to protect the legacy of the Four Wangs (Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Hui, and Wang Yuanqi), diligently copying and practicing their works. Second, some painters were dissatisfied with the decline of the Four Wangs and sought their own paths, hoping to correct their decadent style. They considered themselves to be shouldering the responsibility of rescuing the endangered. Third, some painters advocated a return to the past, imitating the Song and Yuan dynasties, claiming that this was the only authentic art of the East. Fourth, some painters believed that Chinese painting had gone bankrupt and was not suitable for the modern era. Therefore, they studied Japanese or Western painting to refine Chinese painting, claiming to be integrating Chinese and Western, ancient and modern styles. Some praised the new, some clung to the old, each sect and faction established its own camp, forming a chaotic and disorderly situation.

Therefore, the style of Chinese painting over the past century has been very chaotic. On the positive side, it has been constantly changing, improving, discarding dross, absorbing new nutrients, and experimenting in many ways, approaching the new and the international. On the other hand, it has been constantly groping, unsure whether to return to the past or embrace the new, unable to find its own path. This is an undeniable phenomenon. However, in this chaotic and complex art world, there are naturally unique works that are detached and refined, elegant and graceful, beautiful and enchanting, full of charm, powerful and vigorous, with bold and strong brushwork, and possessing a refined spirit and elegant demeanor, each reaching its own exquisite level. The Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Art Museum is about to organize a "Century of Painting Exhibition." If they can select some of these works and systematically study the painting styles of the past century and analyze their evolution, it would be of profound significance.

### Inscription on Professor Yu Jianhua's Five-Foot Continuous Huangshan Panoramic View

(1) Chen Dingshan

I've been to Huangshan five times in three years, but today I'm no longer free;
I cherish every peak and every valley, with thirty-six reasons why.

I haven't been to Huangshan for ten years, my dreams are filled with apes and cranes among the clouds;
The painter adds to my sketch, is my revisiting in old age just a coincidence?

(2) Bai Jiao

Ten years of dreams of Huangshan, today I can enjoy it from my couch;
The old man's brush has a spirit, his ink makes heaven and earth sorrow.

(3) Xu Xinqin

A vast view from a small boat, the homeland's green hills are most missed;
Awake from wine in a high tower, still enjoying the scenery as if sketching.

(4) Xu Xinqin

The world-famous strange pines and sea of clouds, are captured in the artist's scroll;
Don't say the new coolness surprises all around, hanging on the four walls, it brings a clear breeze.

(5) Lao Dan

I have been to the foot of Huangshan, but never climbed the Tiandu Peak;
Now I see Jianhua's painting, and believe he has captured the essence of nature.

### Huangshan Panoramic View - Liu Kaiqu

### Yu Jianhua's Painting Exhibition - Liu Kaiqu

Master Yu Jianhua is a versatile artist whose love for art can be said to be rooted in heredity and inherent in his nature, especially for the art of modeling. In his early years, he had a wide-ranging study of craftsmanship, patterns, and painting. His book "The Latest Pattern Method" (published by Commercial Press) was the only good book in the Chinese pattern world more than twenty years ago. Later, he gradually focused his attention on painting. He greedily practiced and explored charcoal, watercolor, and oil painting in Western painting; machinery, projection, perspective, and architecture in utensil painting; and finally devoted himself to Chinese painting. In Chinese painting, he painted many landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds, but he focused on landscapes. There are many schools in landscape painting, and although he dabbled in all of them, he focused on sketching from life. He traveled extensively to famous mountains and rivers in China, such as Tiantai, Yandang, Lushan, Wuyi, Taishan, Huangshan, Baiyue, and Jiuhua, all of which bear his sketching footprints. He especially loves Huangshan, and has painted the most of it. Recently, he painted "Huangshan Panoramic View," which can show the entire appearance of Huangshan in front of the viewer, with thousands of rocks and ravines and a myriad of scenes. On the one hand, it fully demonstrates the greatness of Huangshan, and on the other hand, it fully demonstrates Master Yu's profound artistic skills. Some people compare learning to a pyramid, with a broad foundation below and a towering structure above.

With Master Yu's rich artistic knowledge, it is no wonder that he has achieved such great accomplishments, but Master Yu is not old and his energy is strong. His current works cannot be considered the pinnacle of the pyramid. From broad to concise, he continues to conduct in-depth research, and his progress has no end. It is said that the "Huangshan Panoramic View" would take an ordinary painter at least a month to paint, but Master Yu finished it in five days. This ability to write like flying is probably rare even among modern calligraphers!

Now, Master Yu is publicly exhibiting hundreds of his masterpieces created in the rear in recent years. I would like to write a few words to express my admiration.

### Talking About Artists - Shen Yan

What is an artist? An artist is someone who loves life and is captivated by it. In this respect, he is a man of action, similar to a hero. However, his activity focuses more on the spiritual or dreamlike, distinguishing him from a hero. He does not overcome concrete reality or resist with physical strength; rather, he feels himself in conceptions and images that contain the meaning of life. He has a strong power of expression. He can fantasize about objects, infuse randomly fabricated content with life, and then stimulate himself with this illusory feeling. In this realm of dreamlike emotion, he is a fighter, a victor, and at the same time, an observer. In his expression, the soul of his creation is the goal he strives for, with a sense of command over his magic wand. Behind his excitement, there is a composed mind, an understanding or wisdom that supports his diverse components.

How does an artist grow? Who will write his history of development for us? Why does natural impulse become so introverted? Unless a great poet appears, creating and monitoring his creation, and records the various motivations or internal situations of the conception and production of his creation, unadorned, for himself and the world, we will probably not get a complete answer to these questions.

### Words on Music - Ning Xuren

Music is the best art, better than anything else at aiding human peace. Where there is beautiful music, it is difficult to be dissatisfied with life. - (Herbert Spencer)

Music is irresistible, its power is boundless; it guides benevolent emotions, peace, and love. - (Thackeray)

### Schubert

Schubert was once hailed as Beethoven's successor, but he lived an extremely impoverished life. He composed a large number of songs, such as "Hark, Hark, the Lark" and "Ave Maria," which are sung by music lovers. His Eighth Symphony was never finished. This is the famous "Unfinished Symphony," and this piece is like this.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood - Ye Jingfeng

Mr. Ding is so ill that, let alone me, a stranger, being able to extract any information from him about that group, I fear even his own parents, wife, and children would not be recognized if they stood before him.

"This is precisely one of the key leads I need to explore. A series of important secrets can be found on him!" I spoke truthfully, but feigned anger, complaining to the head of the Japanese special agents, and urging him to order the relevant officials to send Mr. Ding to the hospital. They agreed to send Mr. Ding to the temporary rear hospital for treatment. I said, "The facilities there are incomplete. It would be better to send him to a municipal or private hospital; I have other uses for him." They said that if the "Jiao" had confirmed, it could be done.

According to the doctor's diagnosis, Mr. Ding's condition was not just a common wound inflammation, nor just the result of beatings and electric shocks, and various nerve stimuli, but was somewhat like acute tuberculous meningitis and oral inflammation occurring simultaneously. If it were simply acute tuberculous meningitis, intermittent periods of clarity would quickly follow spinal tap and injection. Unfortunately, the wounds were severe, and he had suffered non-judicial torture. His life was hopeless, and even intermittent moments of clarity and clear thinking were impossible.

Of course, I was disappointed. But for the sake of the group's information and Mr. Ding's life, I asked the doctor to make every effort to save Mr. Ding's life. However, the doctor said that if his diagnosis was correct, even if he were sent to the largest and most complete hospital in the United States, not to mention the small place of Tianjin, China, Mr. Ding's life would only have a chance of one in four hundred thousand! In other words, out of every four hundred thousand people, perhaps one could be saved, and he would have to be healthy and have strong resistance on a normal day.

As expected, after the doctor performed spinal tap, examination, injection, and other procedures, this patriotic man, who had been wounded, tortured, and inhumanely tormented, became heavier and heavier by the minute. His two arms were constantly making rhythmic movements - writing, aiming, firing a gun, sending telegrams, etc. - these were probably the important tasks he usually performed, and had become subconscious habits, replaying and cycling endlessly in a state of high fever and delirium. In addition, every now and then, his lips trembled, and his hoarse vocal cords emitted one or two syllables. I listened carefully and quietly, and discerned several words from the blurred sounds, which, like the habitual gestures, were also rhythmically repeated in a cycle - hit, do, quick, be careful,... come on!

"Come on," I understood the last two syllables clearly, but I couldn't guess their meaning; they didn't sound like a password, nor did they sound like calling someone's name. Later, in a family letter in Mr. Ding's file in the Japanese intelligence department, it was found that Mr. Ding's wife's name was "Lian," and his only three-year-old daughter's name was "Xiao Lian"; only then did I realize that the two words "Come on" were perhaps "Lian," or "Yun Yun Lai"!

More than forty hours later, although the doctor had done his best to fulfill his responsibilities, Mr. Ding finally sighed his last breath and passed away.

### Sunday Chat: Pearson Innocent - Hai Feng

First, let me introduce a telegram from Tokyo three days ago:

"James, a nineteen-year-old American soldier, raped the wife of a local shipowner, and was sentenced to death by a military court after three days."

What about Pearson, the American soldier who was involved in the case of raping Shen Chong, a student at Peking University, half a year ago?

Let us explain the development of this situation with the news of the past week.

Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, expressed disappointment in Beijing on June 20 regarding the fact that the US Navy Department's military judge advocate general was going to drop the charges against Pearson. He said:

"I was present at the trial of Pearson and, based on all the evidence, the defendant should be convicted of rape... He expressed his views on the incident with a very solemn attitude:

"All of China is closely watching the test of the dignity of American law."

This is a view that can represent all the Chinese people.

Let's look at the reactions from various parties:

(1) The Joint Student Union of Peking University has expressed its attitude towards Pearson's acquittal.

(2) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed our ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, to inquire with the US about the US authorities' cancellation of the verdict against Pearson, who raped a Chinese female student, and to request the US side, through Ambassador Stuart, to maintain the original verdict of the US military court in Beiping against the perpetrator. (Note: The original verdict found Pearson guilty of rape and sentenced him to fifteen years of penal servitude.)

(3) Until June 30, when Ambassador Stuart answered questions at Yenching University, he gave the following answer:

Question: In the case of the rape of Chinese female student Shen Chong by American soldiers in Beiping, the principal offender Pearson was declared innocent in the United States. What is the ambassador's view?

Answer: I sent a telegram yesterday to inquire, and the telegram said that the case has not yet been pronounced, and the US Navy's highest authorities are still investigating.

But what is the basis for the rumor of an acquittal?

According to our speculation, the US Attorney General has already made a decision to drop the charges against Pearson, and now only awaits the approval of the US Secretary of the Navy. Therefore, when Ambassador Stuart answered reporters, he also said: "The US Navy's highest authorities are still investigating," which shows that, based on the current situation, there is a good chance that Pearson's conviction will be overturned.

But the United States is a country ruled by law, and it will take this case, which is related to the friendship and diplomatic relations between the two countries, very seriously.

### Free Talk: Mrs. Shaw - Peeking Through a Tube

The nearly centenarian literary giant George Bernard Shaw was able to achieve his present success largely thanks to his virtuous helpmate. Due to her gentle and kind nature and attitude, and her superior organizational and managerial abilities, she constantly gave Shaw encouragement and prevented him from worrying about household matters. She arranged a tranquil and artistic environment for him, allowing him to focus on his writing.

Shaw's wife was Miss Payne-Townshend, an idealist and practitioner of social reform. She had a strong sense of social service, so she enthusiastically participated in all social reform gatherings and activities, abandoned all vanity, and avoided opportunities to stand out as much as possible. Therefore, it was difficult to find her name and traces in newspapers and places that could attract public attention.

When she met and befriended Shaw, he was still an unknown figure, one of the many journalists constantly rushing around. However, with her unique insight, she already respected his talent and character. Once, Shaw suffered an unexpected injury and was on the verge of succumbing to illness. Thanks to her devoted care, he gradually recovered. Shaw was moved by her deep friendship and married her in 1898. Because of her diligent encouragement and comfort, he abandoned his journalistic career and devoted himself to literary creation.

Shaw was already a middle-aged man of forty-two when he married his wife. His wedding with his wife was a joke, and Shaw still couldn't help laughing when he first mentioned it. It is said that their wedding was scheduled to be held at the registry office. He had invited two friends to be witnesses in advance, one of whom was the very famous social philosopher Wallace. These two witnesses, who already had considerable social status, were naturally dressed several times better than the groom. At that time, Shaw searched his wardrobe but could not find an outfit that was good enough. As a result, although he was happily busy with entertaining guests, the registrar who presided over the wedding did not pay attention to him, thinking that his attire was not suitable for a groom. When the wedding was about to begin, the registrar mistakenly paired Miss Payne-Townshend with the well-dressed Mr. Wallace. Although this mistake was immediately corrected, the scene at the time was funny enough.

Shaw's wife was not only a charming and approachable woman, but also a talented writer, possessing the same sense of humor as Shaw. However, she was overshadowed by her famous husband's talent. Her literary attainments were very high, and it is undeniable that she made indelible contributions to English literature, such as her tireless and dedicated work in translation. She introduced as many plays as possible by the famous French playwright Brieux to England. Her love and admiration for Brieux's plays were not consistent with Shaw's earlier love for Ibsen's plays. However, she remained convinced of Brieux throughout her life.

She was an extremely courageous and determined woman who criticized the shortcomings of modern civilization and offered questions that had been regarded as settled throughout the ages, but were actually wrong. She was one of the most dedicated people in seeking social reform. Her translations of Brieux's plays were fluent and clear, because Brieux's plays also had the same value for British society, so she tried every means to persuade the censorship committee to allow Brieux's plays to be performed in England. She herself was also an executive member of the British Stage Association. After her efforts, she finally managed to convince those stubborn people and achieve victory.

### Crane Soaring to the Sky - Hulu

Prices

Fly in a straight line. Reach a peak, like a sudden convulsion, but encounter a slow doctor, medicine thrown in vain!

Suffering enough, difficult to complain, who cares about the lives of the poor? Rice exceeds the 500,000 yuan mark, every grain a tear drop!

### Known Too Late - Gong Tao

A person went to see a doctor because his eyes were swollen and his ears were ringing. The first doctor told him that it was a problem with his tonsils and that they should be removed, but after the operation, his condition remained the same. He went to see another doctor. This doctor suggested that he have all his teeth extracted, but afterwards, his eyes were still swollen and his ears were still ringing. So he had to consult another doctor. This doctor, after examining him, told him very frankly: "This is an incurable disease, you only have six months to live!"

So he decided to enjoy himself before he died. He bought a new car and made dozens of new clothes. One day he went to a shop to order shirts. The tailor took his measurements and said, "Sleeves, three feet four inches, collar, sixteen inches."

"Why sixteen inches? I've always worn a fifteen-inch collar."

"No, sir," said the tailor. "I must warn you, if you continue to wear a fifteen-inch collar, your eyes will swell and your ears will ring."

### The Secret of Praise

If you want to praise someone, you should praise him more specifically. If you want to praise someone's home, avoid simply saying, "Your home is really nice!" Choose more special places, such as the scenery outside, the interior furnishings, etc. Do not just praise a woman's hat: "It suits you very well," think of a new angle and color to praise her with.

### Jasmine - Xu Ren

The jasmine belongs to woody plants, which like warmth and fear cold. The second and third months of spring are the time to plant it. Cut off the old branches, making them into sections about four or five inches long, plant them in the soil, and cover them with fine sand. They will germinate in about ten days, poking their heads out of the sand. Then, dig good mud ridges in the garden, gather a dozen jasmine sprouts into a clump, and transplant them into the mud ridges, leaving some distance between each clump. By the early summer of the second year, the jasmine will begin to bud, and each clump will produce twenty or thirty beautiful flowers. It stops flowering in September of the lunar calendar. At this time, it is covered with straw to keep it warm and overwinter. In the second spring it can be planted again.

There are foreign, native, single petal, and double petal varieties of jasmine. The double petal variety is the most precious. The color is whiter than other varieties, and the aroma is more intense. The flowers can last for three or four days without wilting, and the petals overlap into five petals, like the shape of a lotus flower.

In addition to decoration, jasmine can also be used to fumigate tea and make jasmine scented tea with tea leaves, which has a good color and aroma. This is a special product exported from Fujian. Therefore, many villagers and farmers rely on growing jasmine flowers for their livelihood. So it is difficult to see jasmine planted in clay pots in Fujian, but rather dozens or even hundreds of hectares of jasmine gardens in the fields. Walking among them, one can see an endless sea of ​​snow-white flowers, which is a spectacle. On summer evenings, a clear breeze blows from the flower clusters, carrying a strong fragrance.

In this scarlet summer, not only should clothes be white, but any object that is white gives people a cool and refreshing feeling. Flowers are loved by people, and the creator specially opens some pure white flowers for people in the summer. So jasmine, magnolia, and other flowers have become people's favorite flowers in the summer.

Among all the fresh flowers, jasmine is the most intimate with women. Twenty years ago, most women had not cut their hair, and everyone was fighting to dress up their hair. In summer, the women liked to use tender copper wire to string the jasmine flower at the base, and put many flowers together to make an arc-shaped garland, or other delicate shapes, around the delicate hair bun. Young girls also used copper wire to thread jasmine flowers into butterfly and full moon shapes, and hang them on the lapel or chest. But later, women cut their hair, and there was no longer a hair bun that could surround jasmine flowers. As for the fashion of hanging jasmine on the chest, it has long passed. Jasmine flowers can no longer get close to the fragrance and skin of women's hair, which should be the sadness of jasmine flowers.

### Voices from the Old World - Li Zhen

"Horror Film" "Web of Deceit"

Adapted from the stage play "Bowing and Submitting," "Web of Deceit" is clearly a social drama. Because the director failed to grasp the keynote of the play, Zhao Futang's murder of his nephew seemed extremely unreasonable.

The clever director only paid attention to the "horror" scenes, but the "horror" atmosphere still could not cover up the unrealistic and distorted subject matter.

Qiao Qi's Zhao Futang has a better performance, but it is a bit too tense, a bit too much; Huai Jin's performance in the first half of the play is still stable, but the section before her departure in the second half of the play suddenly changed its tone. Su Manyi's social butterfly can't even recite the lines, let alone talk about other movements and expressions.

The recording of this play, however, has achieved particularly good results.

"How Cruel Fate"

In this film, the playwright forced some "fatalistic" ideas on the audience, writing all the university students as pitiful insects, especially the "cruel fate" woman Zhou Yuqing. She was controlled by others everywhere, she dared not resist, nor did she want to resist, she was bullied and humiliated, and she believed in fate in everything. This is enough to satirize the shortsightedness of the directors.

The times are advancing, and the voices of the corrupt, outdated, old world can only hide in the darkness and emit their stench.

Wang Xichun's Zhou Yuqing is stable and competent, Xu Li's emotions are too intense, and the play is always in motion. Guo Ping's Zhu Wanjun, the character itself is not unified, and the performance also lacks inner emotion.

This film, directing and technically, has nothing to commend.

"A Warrior's Spring Dream"

British films have their own unique style, delicate and lifelike, without the impetuous emotions of American films. This "A Warrior's Spring Dream" depicts the life story of British officer Clive Caine, his friendships, love affairs, duels, hunting, military service, and all other life events, using these events to string together his life's work. Undoubtedly this is a biopic. It is worth mentioning that the actor who plays the male lead Clive Caine, Lao Lifuli, portrays three periods from youth to middle age to old age, with significantly different performances. Especially the Clive Caine in his old age, has an unforgettable impression.

The director handles the whole film in a simple and unadorned manner, clear and moving, and several repeated contrasts show his intelligence.

"Dewdrop Peony"

Unlike those pornographic sentences used in the advertisements, this play has accurate and vivid content. It describes the process experienced by a girl engaged in dancing arts throughout her life, striving to dedicate her entire life to art, and also gaining an eternally glorious life in art.

Under the director's delicate handling, this is a deeply moving good film. Loretta Young has a particularly good harvest. Kang Leiweide, who plays the dancer Rou Xing, is the most sophisticated and accomplished of the male actors.

Two Song and Dance Films

"Peach and Plum Competing for Fragrance" and "The Moon is Especially Bright in Mid-Autumn Festival", the former is better than the latter, especially the story of "Peach and Plum Competing for Fragrance" is written in a more casual manner, and the arrangements for many singing scenes are also more reasonable and appropriate. "The Moon is Especially Bright in Mid-Autumn Festival" appears to be more empty as a whole, and the performance is also much worse.

Other films such as "Blood Bandit Commando" and "Adventures in New York" and "Sea of People" can only be regarded as third and fourth-rate films. Apart from the exciting opening scenes, there is nothing more to ask for in terms of film art.

### Zhang Qun Clarifies the Significance of Mobilization: Concentrating Efforts on Construction, Inviting Relevant Leaders to Discuss Implementation Methods

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The General Mobilization Act, passed by the State Council on the 4th, was delivered to the Executive Yuan at 9:00 a.m. on the 5th, making it a rare instance of a State Council resolution being delivered to the Executive Yuan so quickly. Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan, convened relevant department heads at the Executive Yuan from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on the 5th to conduct preliminary discussions on the implementation methods of the plan. The heads of various departments are also drafting proposals for the work of their respective departments, which may be discussed at the political affairs meeting on the 8th. After the public announcement of the capital's political atmosphere and the mobilization plan, it has clearly turned from depression to anticipation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan, made a statement on the 5th as the National Government's General Mobilization Order is about to be implemented. The original words are as follows:

This Yuan received yesterday the National Government's instruction to vigorously implement national general mobilization, eliminate obstacles to democracy, and implement the policy of peaceful national reconstruction. This is a major measure taken by the government to strengthen the national reconstruction process. The reasons why the country has no choice but to mobilize for suppressing the rebellion today have been detailed in the full text of the Chairman's proposal. At the beginning of the implementation, I would like to reiterate its significance and explain the understanding and efforts that all the people and officials and soldiers of the country should have in the future, in order to encourage them.

China was originally a poor and weak country. As a result of the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, the country's vitality has become increasingly depleted, and the people's lives have become increasingly difficult. It was hoped that after the victory, we would quickly engage in construction, making politics democratic and the economy industrialized. Unfortunately, during the war of resistance, the Chinese Communist Party took advantage of the country's difficulties to accumulate strength. After the victory, it became an internal obstacle to national reconstruction. The government's peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party, the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, and the continuous efforts of General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart, friends of the United States, to mediate could not reverse the Communist Party's ambition to seize power by violence. After the reorganization of the government, I still expressed hope that effective military measures could be taken to quickly achieve the goal of resolving domestic disputes and restoring unity through political means. Unfortunately, in the past two months or so, the Communist Party's arrogance has become even more rampant, the rebellion has become more widespread, and it has once again rejected the National Senate's proposal to resume peace talks. The above facts are all seen and heard by the people of the country.

Recalling that after the victory of the War of Resistance, the government was working hard to reorganize the army, resettle refugees, prepare for democratic constitutionalism, protect the people's freedom and rights, and restore and build the economy, but the Communist bandits went in the opposite direction, trying their best to expand the army and expand the rebellion. They spared no effort to destroy public and private property and violate the lives and freedom of the people. The government's cumulative construction cannot match the Communist bandits' vicious destruction. If such rampant ferocity and atrocities are not quickly suppressed, the country and the nation will inevitably be destroyed. Therefore, the government has no choice but to act resolutely to comfort the people and save the country out of concern for the country.

The significance of general mobilization is to concentrate the will and strength of the whole country to eliminate obstacles to national reconstruction on the one hand and to raise the awareness of the whole people to engage in political and economic construction work to the best of their ability and as far as the situation allows. In this regard, the people of the whole country must have a fundamental understanding that this is a struggle between the forces of construction and destruction in China, a struggle between democratic forces and anti-democratic forces, and the key to China's rise and fall. China's construction still needs to go through this stage, which was not expected at the beginning, but since the situation is inevitable, we must gather the strength of the whole country to overcome this difficulty. We seek unity through suppressing the rebellion and seek rejuvenation through hard work. The more firm our will and the more concentrated our strength, the shorter this difficult process can be.

Because the significance of general mobilization is not only to passively suppress the rebellion, but also to actively build. The government is currently carrying out constitutional preparations, and the implementation period is not far away. In order to cultivate the spirit of constitutionalism, special attention should still be paid to the protection of the people's basic rights, but the people's rights are based on the stability and unity of the country. Now that the country is striving for stability and unity, the people of the whole country must place the interests of the country and the nation above their personal interests. The government should respect the people's freedom and rights as much as possible, and the people should also respect the law, cherish order, and strengthen their sense of responsibility to the country. Only in this way can the situation of stability and unity be quickly restored in the present, and in the future it will be the real foundation of democratic constitutionalism. From the perspective of government personnel, during the general mobilization period, the affairs of government personnel are intensified and their responsibilities are increased. Therefore, they must first seek their own soundness in order to quickly and effectively mobilize the power of the people. In this regard, we must strengthen our attention to the use of politics and political discipline.

In the use of politics, we must first pay attention to the tightness and flexibility of the vertical and horizontal relations. In the vertical direction, it is necessary to ensure that every law and decree is implemented from the upper level to the grassroots level without delay, distortion, or perfunctoriness. In the horizontal direction, agencies and departments within agencies should cooperate with each other, with clear responsibilities, without overstepping authority or shirking responsibility. Government officials should especially establish credibility with the people and obtain their cooperation. Only in this way can every law and decree be implemented universally and meet the requirements of the country. In terms of political atmosphere and discipline, corruption must be eradicated and the spirit of upholding the law must be established. During the mobilization period, the power of political control is more universal and profound. If the integrity of the executors is not strictly observed, it will be enough to hinder the implementation of government orders, damage the government's reputation, and arouse the people's doubts. Therefore, government personnel and national army generals and soldiers must be especially strict in regulating themselves and supervising their subordinates. If anyone takes advantage of their position to seek personal gain, engage in corruption, abuse their power, arbitrarily violate the law, infringe on the people's rights, or evade responsibility, conceal chaos, or condone bandits, they will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. In particular, it is hoped that the people of the whole country will report corrupt, fraudulent, and troublemaking officials and soldiers who condone bandits as much as possible to assist the government in monitoring areas that its power cannot reach, so as to achieve the effect of rectifying political and military discipline. Reviewing the history of the Chinese National Revolution, for more than 50 years, although China has suffered many internal and external troubles, the process of national construction has never been reversed. The rising Chinese nation, its rejuvenation, cannot be hindered by any reactionary force. Now that the government has made the determination to seek unity through suppressing the rebellion and to seek rejuvenation through hard work, it is hoped that compatriots across the country will support the government's national policy, contribute all their strength, and fight together.
