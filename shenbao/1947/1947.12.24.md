### Government Strengthens Financial Controls, Strict Management of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decided, Executive Yuan Passes Two Measures in Routine Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Executive Yuan held its 35th meeting on the morning of the 23rd, presided over by Premier Zhang. The meeting passed important matters such as the Regulations for Strengthening Financial Controls (full text published on the left corner of page 2), the draft Organizational Regulations of the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau, the establishment of a Review Committee for Receiving Enemy, Puppet, and Traitor Cultural Relics, and several appointments and removals.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Regulations were passed at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd. It is reported that the content of the management regulations is divided into management methods for cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, as well as methods for military supply of yarn and cloth for export, and principles for production guidance. These regulations were drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs based on the principles of unified purchase, unified sale, commissioned spinning, and commissioned weaving, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The details are as follows:

Cotton Management: 1. All cotton required by designated commissioned spinning mills shall be purchased by the association at the prescribed price, and free purchase is not allowed. Cotton required by non-designated spinning mills shall be purchased by the association on their behalf, or they shall apply to the association for approval and obtain a certificate, and purchase it themselves at the price prescribed by the association; 2. The unified purchase of cotton shall be handled by an institution established or entrusted by the association; 3. Cotton merchants in cotton-producing areas shall sell all the cotton they have collected to the association's unified cotton collection institution at the price prescribed by the association, and shall not sell it privately; 4. Designated commissioned spinning mills shall report the amount of existing cotton in storage to the association and shall not sell it; 5. All cotton machine packing plants in various places shall be controlled by the association; 6. At important transportation hubs, customs clearance and transshipment of cotton shall be verified based on the transportation certificate issued by the association; 7. The association shall have overall control over the purchase of foreign cotton, the receipt of foreign cotton at ports, and the export of yarn and cloth in exchange for foreign cotton. Cotton Yarn Management: 1.

Spinning mills with more than 3,000 spindles and deemed qualified by the association shall be designated by the association to spin cotton yarn in accordance with the prescribed methods; 3. Commissioned spinning mills shall set the amount of cotton used for spinning each bale of yarn at 453 pounds, using the association's current qualified cotton as the standard, and the commissioned spinning fee and profit (including unified tax, etc.) shall be based on 459.5 pounds of cotton (20-count raw material) per bale of 20-count yarn as the calculation standard, and shall be paid in legal tender converted at the price prescribed by the association; 4. Commissioned cotton yarn shall still use the original trademarks of each factory, but shall meet the specifications of the standard products set by the association, and the association shall send personnel to periodically sample the yarn, conduct centralized inspection, and reward or punish according to the quality. 6. Cotton yarn sales shall adopt the following methods: (A) Cotton yarn shall be supplied by the association to weaving mills deemed qualified by the association for commissioned weaving, in accordance with the commissioned weaving methods; (B) Before the association completes the investigation and registration of weaving factories that are not qualified for commissioned weaving, the relevant trade associations or groups shall temporarily be responsible for reporting the names of the factories, their production equipment, and the actual amount of yarn required, in order to verify the cotton yarn. Cotton Cloth Management: 1. Weaving mills with 30 or more power looms, or weaving mills deemed qualified by the association, may apply to the country to sign contracts for commissioned weaving of cloth; other manufacturing factories may also be handled in the same way when necessary; 2.

### Amendment to the Organizational Laws of the Five Yuan: Executive Yuan to Have Fourteen Ministries and Three Commissions; Legislative Yuan's Organization and Powers Expanded

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The amendment to the organizational laws of the Five Yuan was fully passed after discussion at the Legislative Yuan's routine meetings on the 23rd, morning and afternoon. The meeting today was chaired by President Sun, and President Yu of the Control Yuan was also present to explain. The main points of the amendment to the organizational laws of the Five Yuan are that the original four ministries and three commissions of the Executive Yuan remain unchanged, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce retains its original name, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is abolished, the Ministry of Labor is renamed the Ministry of Social Affairs, a Ministry of Food is added, and the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics is renamed the Executive Yuan. The number of Legislative Yuan committees is increased from seventeen to nineteen, the chairmen are renamed conveners, and the number of people is also increased from one to three or five. The number of judges of the Judicial Yuan is increased from nine to seventeen, the qualifications are relaxed, and the term of office is changed from the original lifetime tenure to nine years. The Supreme Court, Administrative Court, and other institutions are re-established. The organizational law of the Control Yuan changes the original system of sending supervisors to various places to conduct inspections to allowing the Control Yuan to divide the country into regions and establish Control Yuan supervisory offices as needed. The main amendment to the organizational law of the Examination Yuan is to increase the number of examination committee members from eleven to nineteen and to change the Examination Department to the Examination Ministry. The meeting also passed the organizational law of the Legislative Yuan committees and the amendment to the law on the election and recall of legislators. The next routine meeting will be held on the 27th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The draft amendment to the Executive Yuan's organizational law was discussed at the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the morning of the 23rd. After a heated debate on the establishment of ministries, all seventeen articles were amended and passed. It was resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce would still be called the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications would be abolished, and the Ministry of Labor would be renamed the Ministry of Social Affairs. The original eight ministries and commissions were changed to seventeen ministries and commissions. However, Secretary-General Lou Tongsun temporarily read an order from the National Government, stating that the Executive Yuan requested that the current National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics be changed to a Ministry of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and be affiliated with the Executive Yuan. This case was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration in the afternoon. Regarding the Executive Yuan's request to add a Ministry of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, some suggested placing it after the Ministry of Food, while others believed that the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics should not be changed to a ministry, and that the Director-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics did not need to be a political appointee. President Sun cited examples from Britain and the United States, explaining that foreign budget offices were departments of the Ministry of Finance, and that we did not need to establish a separate ministry, and that the Director-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics did not need to advance and retreat with the cabinet. It was resolved to amend the Executive Yuan's organizational law again, changing Article 5 to "The Executive Yuan shall establish a Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and a Government Information Office, and their organizations shall be determined by law." (Full text of the Executive Yuan's organizational law published in the left corner)

### Legislative Yuan Proposals Divided into Government and Committee Types

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The amendment to the Legislative Yuan's organizational law was discussed by the Legislative Yuan on the 23rd, morning and afternoon, and has been passed. The main points are that the original seventeen committees have been increased to nineteen, and the original one chairman for each committee has been changed to three or five conveners. Each committee will also add one to three specialist committee members. The proposal procedures are also divided into two types: government proposals and committee proposals, to show the distinction. President Sun explained the main points of the amendment to the Legislative Yuan's organizational law at the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the morning of the 23rd, stating that the powers and organization of the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the constitution will be expanded. In the future, all national governance guidelines and policies must first be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for discussion, so its importance is by no means comparable to the current Legislative Yuan. This amendment to the organizational law adds several committees, which are established according to the ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, in order to better coordinate administration and legislation. The reason why important rules of procedure of the Legislative Yuan are included in the Legislative Yuan's organizational law is that the main work of the Legislative Yuan is to hold meetings, and the important rules of procedure should be included in the organizational law. Another key point in the new amendment is the method of making proposals in the future. The new regulations, based on the strengths of both the United Kingdom and the United States, stipulate that both the government and committee members can make proposals. However, in order to prevent an excessive number of proposals from committee members, committee proposals must first be submitted to the plenary session for discussion. In the future, each committee will have three to five conveners, which is related to party cooperation. In the future, there will be no so-called minority or majority parties in our country, and all political parties participating in politics will be government parties. With three to five conveners, if there are important military issues, opinions can be communicated in advance to avoid division.

### Increase in Grand Justices, Term of Nine Years; Examination Yuan's Examination Department Changed to Ministry

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The amendment to the Judicial Yuan's organizational law and the amendment to the Examination Yuan's organizational law were passed at the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd. The biggest changes in the former are in the Grand Justices section and the various levels of courts section. Regarding the Grand Justices, the original organizational law stipulated nine people, but now it is increased to seventeen. The qualifications were not specified in the original organizational law, but now it is stipulated that they should have the following qualifications: A. Have served as a judge of the Supreme Court for more than ten years. B. Have served as a legislator for more than nine years. C. Have served as a professor of major legal subjects at a university for more than ten years. D. Have served as a judge of an international court or have authoritative works on public law or comparative law. E. Have studied law, have rich political experience, and have a renowned reputation. The term of office is set at five years. During the meeting, Chen Ruxuan argued that the Grand Justices should have lifetime tenure in order to be transcendentally independent and not be swayed by political tides. Zhao Pei and Jian Guansan opposed qualification E, believing that those with rich political experience could also serve as Grand Justices, which would easily lead to incompetent people filling the ranks. Dai Xiujun and others opened the door for friendly parties. As a result, the term of office for Grand Justices was still set at nine years, and qualification E was retained. Regarding the original organizational law of the various levels of courts, it only stipulated that the Judicial Yuan would establish civil divisions, criminal divisions, administrative trial divisions, and a civil service disciplinary committee. After the amendment, the current system was restored, and the Supreme Court, Administrative Court, and Civil Service Disciplinary Committee were re-established. The main amendment to the Examination Yuan's organizational law was to increase the number of examination committee members to nineteen and to change the original Examination Department to the Examination Ministry.

### Exchange Rate of Taiwan Dollars to Legal Tender Changed to One to Ninety

### Foreign Minister Wang Reports at the Executive Yuan: US Conducting Aid to China Work, Soviet Currency Reform Results Not Good

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] When the Executive Yuan held its routine meeting on the 23rd, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on foreign affairs, stating that US aid to China work was underway. Recently, the US Congress passed a bill to allocate 18 million US dollars for temporary assistance, showing US concern for us, and there may be more assistance in the future. Regarding the Soviet currency reform issue, Wang explained that he had received reports from our overseas envoys, but the effect of this reform was not very good. The new currency could not be fully redeemed, about 30%, and the Soviet people suffered a great loss as a result.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Well-informed sources said that if the US Congress approves the China aid and reconstruction plan early next year, President Truman will directly and urgently invite Wei Demai to take the lead, and he is expected to accept.

### National Assembly Convocation Order, Government Set to Promulgate Tomorrow, Election Headquarters Reports Elected Representatives Exceed Legal Number

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] As of the 23rd, the number of National Assembly delegates who have reported to the Election Headquarters has reached 2,000, exceeding two-thirds of the total number of National Assembly delegates. The Election Headquarters will report this result to the National Government today, so that the National Government can issue the National Assembly convocation order on December 25. In addition, a spokesman for the Election Headquarters said on the 23rd that since the Election Headquarters stipulated the procedures for conducting the National Assembly delegate election work, election organs at all levels have actively proceeded according to the procedures. As of December 23, all provinces and cities that have handled the election in accordance with the election and recall law have held general elections as scheduled. All election results have been reported to the Election Headquarters by the competent election offices in various counties and cities or equivalent areas for filing. However, due to inconvenient local transportation, some areas not only have no telecommunications, but also no post offices, so it takes time to report. Moreover, the elections of national and provincial occupational women's groups must count the votes from all provinces or cities to determine the order of election and candidacy. Therefore, as of the 23rd, only more than 2,000 people have reported to the Election Headquarters, and the rest are still being reported one after another. The elections in various provinces and cities that apply supplementary regulations are said to be actively underway, and all will be elected soon.

The Executive Yuan has not yet clarified the content and cannot explain it to the Legislative Yuan.

### Luo Zhuoying Discusses Bandits Exploiting Gaps and Suffering Damage, Shenyang Crisis Gradually Reduced, National Army to Launch Annihilation War Against Bandits

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd] Luo Zhuoying, Deputy Director of the Northeast Headquarters, said that due to the national army's strong forces and strict precautions, the communists avoided attacking "large points" and engaged in "gap exploitation" disturbances. He said that the bandits exploited gaps all the way south from Faku, attempting to attack PanYang, but unexpectedly suffered heavy damage in the battle of "small point" Faku East (southeast of Faku). The bandits were almost completely annihilated, and were subsequently defeated by the national army in Shifosi (north of Shenyang), so the crisis in PanYang has gradually been reduced. Based on the bandit's recent movements, Luo pointed out that there will be a large-scale battle in western Liaoning, and the bandit army in the Zhangwu area may move south to attack Jinzhou, and Xinmin is also one of the key points of the battle. Luo said that the national armies in various places have been deployed and are ready to launch a major annihilation war against the bandits as soon as the opportunity is ripe.

### Editorial: Wartime Bank Deposit Liquidation Measures

Regarding the issue of how to repay wartime deposits, disputes have persisted for a long time. According to Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, the court, although empowered to make judgments increasing or decreasing payments, this remains only a principle without clear and uniform numerical standards. Considering the case between Chen Jilin and the Shanghai branch of the Four Banks Savings Association, adjudicated by the Shanghai District Court last winter, the amount to be paid was increased by a factor of one thousand. Since then, local court judgments have varied widely, ranging from 800 times, 1200 times, 1500 times, 5000 times, to as much as 10,000 times. This summer, the Chongming District Court ruled that a pre-war loan of 400 yuan should be repaid with 20 shi of rice, which, based on the then-current rice price, amounted to approximately 25,000 times the original loan. Therefore, judicial remedies cannot resolve these disputes. Conversely, requests for provisional execution have sparked protests from creditors. Consequently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration instructed that provisional execution be avoided when defendants provide security or deposit the object of the claim. Furthermore, to avoid increasing disputes, the Ministry of Finance consulted with the Ministry of Justice, requesting all levels of courts to temporarily refrain from making independent judgments until the government promulgates clear regulations for repaying pre-war deposits. Thus, a fundamental resolution of this problem requires further, equitable action through legislation.

Now, the proposed measures, namely the "Regulations on the Liquidation of Wartime Deposits and Loans of the Banking Industry," have been passed by the Legislative Yuan. The full text was published in yesterday's newspaper. The key points are as follows: The term "wartime" is divided into two periods. The first is "pre-formal war," i.e., deposits and loans made before August 13, 1937, to be repaid at a rate of 1,703,462 times. The second is "before the declaration of war against Japan," i.e., deposits and loans from August 14, 1937, to December 9, 1941, with monthly interest calculated and repaid at rates ranging from 1,682,432 times to 700,670 times. Debts exceeding 5 million yuan can be paid in installments. The interest on demand deposits is calculated at half the rate. Loans from national banks to government agencies, and deposits of government agencies and financial institutions in national banks, are to be handled according to the original agreements. The Supplementary Regulations on Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery, Article 12, do not apply to the liquidation of deposits and loans of the banking industry hereafter. Furthermore, the term "deposits" is clearly defined to include ordinary, reserve, trust, and other types of deposits. Thus, a legal and clear path to resolving this dispute has been found, which is indeed fortunate.

From the perspective of depositors and debtors, perceptions naturally differ. In occupied areas, after the double loss of deposits being halved and then converted at a rate of 200 to 1, it is estimated that a pre-war deposit of 1,000 yuan would be worth only 2.5 yuan. Calculating at 1,703,462 times, formally requiring repayment of 681,464 times the amount, they will naturally cry out that they are suffering a great loss. On the other hand, depositors, due to rising prices and the resulting depreciation of currency, also suffer considerable losses. According to the Shanghai Wholesale Price Index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, with 1936 as 1 and 1937 as 1.1, the second week of this month has already risen to 132,367. Thus, the recent index is over 120,000 times higher than in 1937. Now, monetary gains are only about 1,700 times, so the loss is certainly not small. Even considering the Shanghai Workers' Living Index, with 1936 as 1 and 1937 as 83.98, it has risen to 61,700 in November of this year, an actual increase of over 73,100 times, far exceeding the 1,700 times. As Mr. Liu of the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee said, "Both sides suffered losses during the war," and "it is difficult to devise a better solution other than this," so they must "consider both sides" to resolve the matter as soon as possible.

However, we want to point out the following three things: First, the issue of how to repay the principal and interest on government bonds. Article 8 of the original regulations states: "The interest on deposits of financial institutions in national banks shall still be governed by the original regulations." Although this is not directly related to government bonds, if the deposits of financial institutions in national banks are not subject to these regulations, then the hoped-for multiple repayment method for general government bondholders is likely impossible. Second, the regulations do not address private debts; these can only be resolved through litigation, in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Procedure. However, given the legislative precedent, the scope of free discretion will likely not be as uneven as before, and indirectly, it can also benefit from the good influence of these regulations. Third, the issue of deposits during and after the war is not covered by these regulations. The name itself is limited to pre-war deposits, and since the declaration of war against Japan on December 9, 1941, the depreciation of the legal currency has become apparent, and various fixed deposits have in fact become very few. We mention this issue in passing now because while fixed deposits are indeed very few, demand deposits have also decreased relatively sharply. Some estimate that the total amount of deposits in various banks and firms now, valued at pre-war currency values, is less than one-tenth of what it used to be. As a result, all the surplus funds in various places are flowing together into the underground money market for speculation, causing unprecedented price hikes and a frenzy of hoarding. If this trend is not addressed by encouraging savings and channeling capital into production, then all other temporary measures will ultimately prove ineffective. But to encourage people to save and turn idle capital into deposits, the key question is how to repay the principal and interest. In other words, how to preserve the value of the currency so that depositors do not suffer unseen depreciation losses, and how to increase interest rates so that they do not lose out, are the practical ways to regulate finance and channel idle capital, and also the effective measures to crack down on hoarding and curb prices.

Now, because the economic situation is too chaotic, everyone has not focused on these fundamental measures and only knows to hastily engage in short-sighted remedies, such as restricting remittances (and there are rumors of restricting the transportation of currency) and restricting lending, etc. Addressing the symptoms in times of emergency, the authorities have their own unavoidable difficulties. But because the restrictions are too strict, all currency will increasingly flee banks and firms and flow into underground circulation and lending, and the result will of course be more idle capital, more speculation, and more difficult regulation. This temporary remedy may not even achieve its original wish. This is far from what we hope for, which is to encourage savings and channel capital into production. We also know that encouraging savings and channeling capital into production is technically very difficult under this inflation. But from the painful experience gained from the pre-war deposit liquidation measures, we certainly do not want to see such phenomena re-enacted in the future in some way, and especially do not want to see surplus funds fleeing banks and firms and becoming truly idle capital.

### Remedial Measures for Academic Status of Graduates of Unregistered Middle Schools During the War of Resistance

[Nanjing, December 23, Central News Agency] The academic status of students of private schools that have not been approved for registration should not be recognized. However, in consideration of the special difficulties during the War of Resistance and post-recovery period, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated a remedial measure for the handling of the academic status of graduates of private middle schools that have not been registered in various places. The retroactive recognition of academic status is very generous, and the procedures are simplified. However, the deadline for completion is the end of July next year. The measures are as follows: For private secondary schools in the recovered areas, which were unable to complete registration procedures during the westward movement of the government and did not apply for registration with the puppet organizations, and have now been approved for registration, the academic status of students before registration shall be retroactively reported for approval and recognition, and their graduation certificates shall be retroactively stamped. For private secondary schools in non-occupied areas during the War of Resistance, which have now been approved for registration, their graduates before registration should be given a limited-time examination by the provincial and municipal education departments, and those who pass the examination shall be recognized as having graduated and their graduation certificates shall be stamped. The examination methods and subjects shall be handled in accordance with the regulations for the middle school student graduation examination. Private secondary schools that have not yet been approved for registration should be strictly ordered to register within a limited time, and those that are poorly managed should be investigated and banned. Students who have graduated from these schools and wish to continue their studies will only be allowed to apply for public and accredited private colleges and universities in 1948 with equivalent academic qualifications. For private secondary schools that were originally approved for registration before the war, but were not moved out during the occupation or registered with the puppet organizations, and are now continuing to operate, the qualification of graduates during the War of Resistance from these schools shall be retroactively reported for approval after verification of the operating conditions over the years by the various departments.

### Political Yuan Meeting Approves Amendment to Strengthen Financial Control Measures

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The Executive Yuan's 23rd routine meeting approved the amendment to the Strengthened Financial Control Measures, which will be promulgated and implemented immediately. The measures were formulated by the Executive Yuan due to the frequent financial chaos in major cities, which was obviously caused by speculative manipulation. In addition to establishing financial management bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other cities, the Ministry of Finance drafted these measures. After detailed review by various responsible agencies, they were submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval and implementation, and reported to the National Government for record. The measures are as follows:

B: In areas where financial management bureaus are established, all types of loans from national banks and bureaus, including pledges, loans, overdrafts, discounts, and import/export bills, should be listed. The inward and outward remittances should be listed by location and submitted to the management bureau for review. Those that do not comply with current laws and regulations may be corrected by the management bureau based on the severity of the circumstances.

C: Interbank deposits and interbank funds should be deposited in the Central Bank in areas where the Central Bank is established. In areas where there is no Central Bank, they may be deposited with each other, but in no case should funds be lent to provincial or municipal banks or commercial firms through discounts or any other means.

D: When national banks and bureaus need to remit funds to adjust balances between branches, they should first consult with the Central Bank. If the Central Bank is unable to handle the transaction in a timely manner, they may purchase remittances, but only for transactions that are received and delivered in different locations, with a maximum term of five days, and the payee must be a branch of the original remitting bank.

Article 3: The business of provincial banks should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Provincial Bank Ordinance. The following items should be earnestly implemented:

B: Provincial and municipal banks' deposits into interbank funds should be deposited in the local Central Bank, except in areas where there is no Central Bank, in which case they may be deposited in other national banks and bureaus. Under no circumstances should funds be deposited in other national banks and bureaus or re-lent to commercial firms.

C: All approved provincial bank offices outside the province should not engage in any business other than remittances; those that are distant should have their offices closed.

Article 4: The deposit and loan interest rates of banks and money houses shall not exceed the rate approved by the Central Bank.

Article 5: Loans from any bank or money house to farmers and workers should be limited to those engaged in their own business. In areas where there is a trade association, loans should be limited to those who have joined the association.

Article 6: For each transaction, any bank or money house should prepare receipts and record them in accordance with regulations. The purpose of each loan must be recorded in detail for verification.

Article 7: Any bank or money house should require depositors to open accounts under their real names. For those using checks, their exact address and identity must be verified and recorded in detail for future reference.

Article 8: When a check issuer violates Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, the paying bank or money house shall be responsible for reporting it.

Article 9: If the amount of returned checks from a commercial bank or money house exchange accounts for more than 50% of the total exchange amount for that day for three consecutive times, and it is found that there are obvious reasons for returning the checks to balance the exchange difference, the local financial management authority may set a deadline for adjustment and instruct local banks and money houses to suspend lending to the bank or money house within the deadline.

Article 10: Unless entrusted by the government, no bank or money house shall engage in the purchase and sale of goods or operate under a separate name. Violators will be prosecuted for hoarding and profiteering, and the Ministry of Finance may revoke their business license.

Article 13: When a national bank, bureau, or provincial/municipal bank violates the provisions of these measures, the Ministry of Finance shall, depending on the severity of the circumstances, order the bank or bureau to investigate the responsible personnel and impose penalties such as reprimands, demerits, or dismissal. In serious cases, they shall be referred to the court for handling.

Article 14: When a commercial bank or money house violates the provisions of Articles 4, 5, or 6 of these measures, in addition to any penalties prescribed by law, the responsible person may be ordered to be replaced, or the bank or money house may be fined up to 50% of the amount of business conducted.

Article 15: If the deposit and remittance of public funds by military and government agencies violates the regulations on the deposit and remittance of public funds by military and government agencies, the financial management authority shall report it to the military and government supervisory agencies or audit agencies at all levels.

Article 16: These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation.

### Republican Party May Independently Propose U.S. Aid to Western Europe Plan Vandenberg Hints at Press Conference

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the U.S. Senate and chief spokesman for Republican foreign policy, hinted at a press conference on the 22nd that the Republican Party may propose its own "Marshall Plan" when Congress reconvenes. He claimed to generally support the overall goals of President Truman's proposed plan to aid European economic recovery with $17 billion over four years, but found it difficult to agree on the details. Vandenberg stated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he leads, intends to study this plan in the "most comprehensive" manner. He personally has "no preconceived notions" about the cost, how the plan should be implemented, or whether it should last for four years. Senator Taft, Chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, criticized Truman's figures as "excessively high" and first proposed that the plan be adjusted annually.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, discussed President Truman's proposed plan to aid European recovery at a press conference, stating that he will insist on the goal of rescuing Europe on a self-help basis. However, he has no preconceived notions about the methods, quantities, or management procedures, and is willing to accept opinions on the possible impact of the plan on the U.S. economy. He feels that the purpose of the aid is undeniable from the perspective of U.S. self-interest, but the entire procedural issue still needs to be debated.

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Republican Senator Taft declared today that if Congress approves President Truman's proposal to allocate $16.8 billion in the first 15 months to aid Europe, European countries may receive more than $8 billion in aid within a year.

### U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Hear Opinions on Aid to Europe Byrnes and Others Invited to Attend

[Our Dispatch] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Washington News, it is reported that when the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee discusses President Truman's long-term aid plan on January 7, many important figures will attend and testify, including former Secretary of State Byrnes, former Lend-Lease Administrator Crowley, former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy, and Jones, a member of Roosevelt's cabinet and the most vocal opponent of loans to the United Kingdom. The scope of the issues involved is unprecedented in the history of the U.S. Congress.

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Congress will launch the largest investigation into American public life and opinion as it discusses the Marshall Aid Plan. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to begin hearing opinions on the Marshall Plan on January 7. Those invited to present opinions include former Secretaries of State Byrnes and Stimson, former Lend-Lease Administrator Crowley, former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy, and Jones, a former member of Roosevelt's cabinet and an opponent of loans to the United Kingdom. Others who may attend and present opinions include Murray, President of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, Green, President of the American Federation of Labor, and representatives of American industry, commerce, and agriculture. Congressional observers expect significant differences in the aid plan finally passed by both houses of Congress.

### Stimson and Patterson Launch Aid to Europe Campaign to Reduce Any Obstruction Attempts

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The Committee for the Marshall Plan to Aid European Recovery, an organization of respected U.S. citizens, launched a campaign here today to resist any attempts by Congress to reduce aid amounts or obstruct the passage of the aid plan. The committee is led by former Secretaries of War Stimson and Patterson, and former Assistant Secretary of State Acheson. Acheson stated at a press conference today that reducing the $6.8 billion in aid requested by President Truman for the first 15 months would inevitably affect the entire plan. Reopening the 36-nation Paris Conference to determine the details of mutual assistance would be extremely helpful in allowing Congress to know in advance that the aid goals can be achieved successfully. Acheson opposed discussing the aid to Europe plan on an annual basis and opposed attaching any political conditions. He feels that most of the aid money should be given as grants rather than loans, and that requiring European countries to provide collateral such as gold is a foolish act. Helping Europe increase production on the one hand while requiring it to repay huge amounts of U.S. dollar debts on the other will cause even more difficult balance of payments problems.

### Truman Signs Emergency Aid to Europe Plan

[Our Dispatch] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman today signed the bill providing $540 million in emergency aid to France, Italy, Austria, and China, and signed the supplemental appropriation bill of $914 million approved by Congress last week.

### Washington Political Test U.S. Will Trend Toward Peace Republican Party Can Defeat Democratic Party

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] According to "Look" magazine, seeking the opinions of 57 political observers in Washington, 20 people believe that Dewey can be a Republican candidate in next year's general election. Other Republicans include Eisenhower with 13 votes, Taft with 12 votes, and Vandenberg with 5 votes, surpassing Stassen and Warren. The observers all agree that Truman will be the Democratic candidate, but the vast majority predict that the Republican Party can defeat the Democratic Party. Nineteen believe that Dewey can be elected president, while five believe that Truman can be elected. Among the 57 political observers, 43 believe that U.S. policy will trend toward peace in the coming year, 13 believe it will trend toward war, and one has no opinion.

### Based on Four-Power Consultation Method to Solve Urgent German Problems Clay Expresses Willingness to Make Another Attempt

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] General Clay, Commander of the U.S. Forces in Germany, stated that the U.S. authorities should make another attempt to solve Germany's most urgent problems on a four-power basis. If this fails, the U.S. and British authorities will take all possible steps to ensure that the economy of West Germany can continue to move forward. Currency reform, the banking system, and the exchange of goods are all issues that must be considered and resolved immediately.

He does not believe that the failure of the London Conference has created a new situation in Germany, but merely prolonged the situation. Now, to strengthen economic integration, any necessary steps should be taken. Clay also said that he will meet with General Robertson, the British military district commander, soon after the holiday to study the factors hindering Germany's recovery.

Political Merger Depends on Public Opinion

He also said that there is currently no decision on engaging in political mergers with any region. This decision must be made after the final attempt to solve the German problem on a four-power basis fails. Clay also solemnly denied rumors that the U.S. will withdraw from Berlin, and reiterated that the plan to give German institutions in the two districts greater authority will continue to be implemented. German authorities will be given the power to try those who violate economic laws, and certain German institutions, especially customs, will be given police powers. Clay continued that, in principle, we must seek the opinions of Germans before establishing political institutions in the war zone. However, governmental actions elsewhere may force the original British and American authorities to establish these political institutions before they can seek the opinions of Germans. The decisions of the German Economic Committee of the British and American districts have a significant impact on the determination of German intentions. The German people are currently eager to avoid actions such as the political merger of the British and American districts. Clay emphasized that political mergers are not irreversible actions. Any action regarding 65 million people is not irreversible. He will never establish a government in any part of Germany that the German people do not want.

### ·German Currency Reform· Inevitable in the British and American Zones

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Preparations for currency reform in the British and American zones of Germany have been completed and are awaiting the orders of the British and American governments to be implemented. Although officials remain silent on this, related parties believe that this is indeed the case. According to reports in the German newspapers, holders of German marks in the British and American zones will exchange ten old marks for three new marks. However, only one of these three new marks will be in cash, and the remaining two marks will be frozen deposits. Wages and other cash income are expected to remain unchanged. The general price level will also remain stable, except for certain special prices. However, the issuance and circulation of new banknotes will be strictly controlled, efforts will be made to unify the exchange rate, and trust in the currency will be restored.

### The New Agency Promoting the Aid to Europe Plan Holds the Power to Distribute and Purchase Materials (Translated by Our Editorial Department)

To implement the Marshall Plan, the U.S. government may need to buy and sell materials worth billions of dollars to supply Western Europe. Several government executives and business consultants are drafting the formula for U.S. aid to Europe. The U.S. government will inevitably establish a new agency to handle this task, and it must be recognized by law and directly accountable to Congress. American experts in Washington and New York drafting the methods for implementing the Marshall Plan already have a fairly clear concept of how this agency will be organized.

In the United States, this agency should have two tasks: First, it must decide how U.S. money and goods should be distributed; second, it must purchase the materials necessary for the aid plan and ensure that they reach their destination. In the U.S. government, these two tasks are distribution and procurement.

In terms of distribution, the U.S. government has methods. Although export controls will end in March next year, the President will definitely ask Congress to extend them, and even expand them.

Regarding the issue of distribution, there are several points:

First, someone must decide on the needs for U.S. goods at home and abroad. Initially, the U.S. hoped to only take the "things that could be saved" and ship them out, but later found that the number of things that could be saved was quite small. Second, after deciding how much to export, it must be further decided how much of it should be shipped to the regions included in the Marshall Plan, and how much should be shipped to other regions, such as Latin America and the Far East.

After these things are done, the specified amount of materials must be allocated to the ten major European countries and West Germany included in the Marshall Plan. At the same time, the priority of which countries should receive aid should be determined based on the degree of urgency.

To obtain these materials, most experts agree that the U.S. government must personally handle the procurement work, or at least control it. Some people hope that a committee organized by experienced merchants will act as the government's purchasing agent, while others advocate that an opportunity that already exists in the government should be responsible for handling it. Some people hope that several government agencies will send representatives to form a joint committee, while others advocate establishing a new agency dedicated to it.

In Europe, a new agency also needs to be established to help promote the Marshall Plan. Most people advocate that a joint committee organized by the Allied nations during the war should be responsible for handling it.

This committee should be composed of representatives from the sixteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan and the United States. Its task is to determine the needs of the participating countries, carefully consider them, balance the supply capacity and needs, and then decide on the distribution method. However, the final decision-making power will still belong to the U.S. distribution agency.

The agency responsible for promoting the Marshall Plan is being drafted by the Committee on Foreign Aid appointed by President Truman (the chairman of the committee is Secretary of Commerce Harriman). A subcommittee led by Senator Fulbright is focusing on the administrative issues of the agency.

One of the biggest challenges currently facing U.S. government officials is how the U.S. can fully control aid to European countries without giving the impression of controlling the governments of European countries.

However, it intends to decide on the fundamental policy by the end of this year and immediately clarify the direction of the cabinet's policy."

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd] It is reported that before January 15, 24 members of the Socialist Party will leave the party and form a new party to oppose the Katayama Cabinet. All 32 members of the People's Cooperative Party may join the new party. Former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano, who was previously dismissed by Katayama, is one of the strong supporters of the new party.

Deputy Squad Leader Ding Binghui and Liaison Officer Zhu Zifu, Squad Leader Shen Zhiren investigated separately. Yi Dang Zhao Boqin, under the guise of recommending ancestors, contacted the abbot monk to discuss Buddhist affairs. The Flame Mouth ritual was held on the 22nd. Zhao wore plain clothes and set up a spirit to recommend. By the evening, the Flame Mouth ritual was completed. The monks invited them to take a bamboo forest tour. After a round of mahjong, a female guest falsely claimed to have a stomach ache. Zhao asked if there were any opium pipes in the temple. They replied that although there was no opium, there was white powder. Zhao then instructed the waiter Wang Pinshan to buy three packets of powder from Fa Bo for 100,000 yuan. At this point, Zhao immediately notified the liaison officer outside the door to report to the bureau. Section Chief Yu ordered officers to rush to the scene with more than 20 auxiliary police officers and arrested the monks Fa Bi, Chongshan, Zongbo, Qi Hui, and Liantang, as well as the resident monk Guantong, and confiscated a large number of opium ash and leftover white powder tin foil, etc., and brought them all back to the bureau.

### Using Military Aircraft to Smuggle Banknotes; Involving Candy Merchants; Should They be Punished? No Legal Provision; Prosecutor Feels Quite Difficult

[Our Own Dispatch] The Air Force Supply Headquarters suspected Li Zhaoxin, captain of the 2nd Squadron of the Air Force, of using military aircraft to smuggle banknotes. During the investigation by the Air Force Supply Headquarters, Sheng Fanchu, a candy merchant in this city who was an accomplice, was transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation on the 20th of this month because he was an ordinary citizen. Li Zhaoxin took a military plane to Guangzhou on official leave on October 14. Sheng Fanchu entrusted him to carry 199 million yuan in legal tender and a letter to Chen Hongxu in Guangzhou. The letter stated: "5% of the 9.95 million yuan in legal tender has been paid off. The remainder is divided into three points: 小 A small package of 20 million yuan is entrusted by Mr. Jiang of the Bank of China to Mr. Wang Leirun of the Bank of China in Guangzhou to buy pencils and bring them to Shanghai. 64 million yuan is entrusted to my brother to remit to Shen. Today, the remittance rate to Sui is 780,000 yuan, and Shen receives 1 million yuan. Please deliver it to the bank for remittance to Shen immediately. 115 million yuan, of which 5 million yuan is for Chen Hanquan, and the remaining 110 million yuan is for my own goods." When Li flew to Guangzhou, the smuggled legal tender and letters were discovered by the airport guards. Li was suspected of using his position to smuggle legal tender for profit and was escorted back to the Shanghai Air Force Supply Headquarters for investigation. Li and Sheng both denied smuggling 199 million yuan in military court, claiming that they actually smuggled 64 million yuan, and that the 5% was interest, not Li's reward. After the case was transferred from the Air Force Supply Headquarters to the District Procuratorate, it was handled by Prosecutor Chen Shoutao. Since there is no clear provision for punishment for smuggling legal tender, it was very difficult to proceed with the case. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Air Force Supply Headquarters requesting to review the entire file of the case, and then scheduled a date to summon the defendants for investigation.

### Wu Shibao's Wife, She Aizhen, Retried; Poses and Smiles; Attempts to Overturn Initial Trial Confessions

On the morning of the 22nd, Wang came down from upstairs and was about to go to the bureau for work. Because he saw the coal stove placed at the entrance of the扶梯, which hindered access, he questioned Cai Shouzhi and had an argument, which turned into a fight. Cai's younger brother also joined the battle. He violently beat Wang Yongxin and called his elder brother, Cai Yanzhi, who works at the Central Bank, and closed the kitchen, surrounded Wang Yongxin and beat him violently. Although Wang tried his best to break out of the encirclement, he was dragged in by the Cai brothers and beaten again, causing Wang to be seriously injured. Later, a neighbor called the police, and they went to the North Sichuan Road Police Bureau to report. He also went to Siming Hospital to examine the injury. As a result, the doctor confirmed that Wang was seriously injured. Wang Yongxin was unwilling to accept that the three Cai brothers jointly humiliated him. What's more, after the first beating ended, he was dragged into the house and surrounded by the three, which was obviously intentional injury. He is now preparing to seek legal relief to protect his human rights.

[Our Own Dispatch] Abbot Chunru of Qingliang Temple at No. 465 Taixing Road in this city was sued yesterday by Guo Guoping from Changzhou to the District Procuratorate, accusing Chunru of enticing and negligence leading to death, requesting investigation. According to the complaint, Guo has a younger brother, Rongjin, who works as a tea room in Qingliang Temple. He is married to He Simei, who is slightly attractive. She often sends clothes to the temple. However, she was coveted by Chunru, who often took the opportunity to flirt with her and threatened and seduced her.

At this point, the electric disease recurred, and he died on the 17th of this month. Guoping believed that Rongjin's death was caused by his wife He Simei's adultery with Chunru.

### Made a Living in Shanghai 38 Years Ago, Now a U.S. Song and Dance King: Earl Carroll Revisits Old Haunts with Female Star

[Our Report] Earl Carroll, the world's most famous American song and dance king after Ziegfeld, arrived in Shanghai from America via Hong Kong at 6 PM the day before yesterday, accompanied by Beryl Wallace, a leading lady in his song and dance troupe. Carroll and company are taking advantage of their vacation to purchase stage supplies and costumes for the troupe members in China and Japan. They will leave Shanghai this morning by plane for Tokyo. They will also perform in Hollywood this time.

Carroll and Ms. Wallace met with our reporter at the Hua An Hotel yesterday afternoon, recounting his experiences in Shanghai 38 years ago and the success story of his song and dance troupe, which was quite interesting.

Carroll was born in Pittsburgh, USA. At the age of ten, he worked as a program distributor, a "little boy," in a theater. After five years, he developed a deep impression and interest in musical theater. When he was sixteen, he went to Manila and worked as a "little boy" on a ship. Later, he went to Hong Kong and worked as a clerk in a company that published the "China Directory."

Came to Shanghai with One Dollar and Seven Cents

He came to Shanghai alone in 1909, carrying only a camera. Walking alone on the street, he suddenly saw a photo studio called "Sullivan." He went in and told the people in the shop that he knew how to take pictures and asked for a job. The photo studio took him in, and Carroll slept in a small room downstairs for three days. At that time, he had only one dollar and seven cents in silver coins in his pocket. A friend from the ship suddenly introduced him to a job as a clerk at the British American Tobacco Company. His job was to convert U.S. dollars or British pounds into silver dollars for the company. He also helped the company pay import taxes on tobacco leaves to the customs. At that time, he was earning 100 silver dollars a month. Carroll still remembers that he often crossed the river to the Pudong warehouse, and asked the reporter if the warehouse still exists today. People outside say that I worked in the Shanghai Customs, that is not true, I have never worked in the Customs. Carroll made a special statement to the reporter.

Returned to America, Song and Dance Career Started

He stayed in Shanghai for three months and then returned to the United States. Because he was influenced by song and dance performances in the theater as a child, he began to write songs and scripts for newspapers after returning to his country. In 1917, he joined the war as a soldier. After the war, he continued to write songs and scripts and produced song and dance dramas in New York. In 1921, he built his first theater in New York, when he was only twenty-seven years old. After Carroll produced sixty song and dance dramas, he moved to Hollywood and built another theater and restaurant, which is the nationally famous "Earl Carroll Theatre," the only special theater in the United States, where customers can eat while watching the show, just like on stage. All the song and dance are called "Earl Carroll Vanities." This theater is also a large radio station, broadcasting all over the world. The song and dance troupe currently has sixty girls, twenty-two leading actors, and a total of four hundred employees. His song and dance troupe has filmed for Paramount, 20th Century Fox, and RKO.

Every Girl in the Troupe is Beautiful

The girls in the Earl Carroll Song and Dance Troupe are the most famous, beautiful, and pretty in the United States. Carroll told reporters, "When I first started the song and dance troupe, people thought the Ziegfeld Follies girls were beautiful, but I think that while some of them were indeed very beautiful, not all of them were beautiful. Therefore, I created a new style. Anyone who joins my song and dance troupe must be extremely beautiful and pretty. We don't care if she can dance or sing, as long as she is beautiful, we will hire her and then train her. The standards are very high." Speaking of his standards for choosing beauties, Carroll said that both face and figure are very important, but figure is especially important. Because beauty can be disguised or transformed in various ways. "No one is truly perfect, they all have to rely on makeup." But the figure cannot be transformed. The age of the girls in his troupe ranges from eighteen until she is no longer beautiful.

Champagne Bath Caused a Sensation in the United States

Ten years ago, Carroll caused a sensation in the United States for coming up with the idea of song and dance girls bathing in champagne, and was eventually arrested for obstructing morality. When asked about the champagne bath, Carroll said: "The reason why I wrote this scene was because I read a novel about the Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty and came up with the idea of borrowing the story of Empress Dowager Cixi suppressing Concubine Zhen into the well. At that time, I did not expect that it would attract everyone's attention."

Before the war, they came to China to buy rattan to make frames for the skirts of the actresses, and also bought farmers' straw hats, painted them with colors and used them as decorations. This time, Carroll wanted to buy some fabrics, but found that many of the previous types of silk satin were no longer available. However, he still bought some other fabrics yesterday. Carroll also said that he remembered that there was a Astor House Hotel. But when he went to look for it yesterday, he said he couldn't find it. Actress Wallace said that she couldn't say what impression she had of Shanghai, but she repeatedly praised the "Jimmy's" dinner.

### Chen Xianglin, the Murderer in the Jin Deming Case, Confesses that the Motive was Uneven Distribution of Loot

[Our Report, Suzhou, 21st] The murder case of Lieutenant Jin Deming, deputy company commander of the New Recruit Company of the Wu County Regiment Management District, and his wife, has been complicated and bizarre, and the truth has not yet been fully revealed. According to Chen Xianglin (Jin's subordinate and new recruit squad leader), the perpetrator who has already been arrested, Yang Huimin, a conscription soldier who is on the run, is undoubtedly the main culprit in the murder. They robbed 10 million yuan in cash, three taels of gold, and gold jewelry. According to Chen's confession, the above property was obtained by Jin through corruption and bribery of new recruits.

### MOE Councilor Liu Explains Student Union Regulations: Direct Election System to Cooperate with Constitutional Implementation

[Our Report, Nanjing, 23rd] The Central University Department Representative Assembly recently resolved to oppose the MOE's newly revised student union regulations. According to Councilor Liu Yingshi of the MOE, the original student union regulations were promulgated during the wartime in 1943, and some of the original clauses did not meet current needs. In order to cooperate with the implementation of the constitution and strive for democratization and direct elections, Article 7, "Whether a member of the Chinese Kuomintang or the Sanminzhuyi Youth Corps," was abolished, and the indirect election system was changed to a direct election system. The original number of directors was uniformly 17, and now it has been increased to 45 according to the proportion of the school's population, so that there is a widespread opportunity. In order to meet the ideal of selecting those with both virtue and ability, it is stipulated that directors must be excellent in conduct and academic performance, and those with leadership ability should be appointed, all in order to cooperate with the constitutional implementation and train students' legal spirit. Most of the other articles are still the original regulations. In the past, the organization of student unions in most schools was not fully implemented in accordance with the regulations, and they were often controlled by elements with other motives. During elections, there were even so-called campaign groups. The school authorities were lenient and did not ban them, which led to disputes in the recent re-election of the student union at Central University. In the future, all schools should implement the regulations.

### Soochow, Hangchow, and Shanghai Universities' Three Graduating Classes from 1943 to 1945 Unanimously Refuse Screening

[Reported by this Newspaper] Several hundred graduates from Soochow, Hangchow, and Shanghai Universities from the three graduating classes of 1943 to 1945 oppose participating in the Ministry of Education's screening process. They sent representatives Liu Wenhua, Zheng Dingneng, and more than ten others to hold a meeting at the International Hotel the day before yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter. Ling Xianyang, President of Shanghai University, Sun Ruilin, Secretary-General, Ossen, Dean of Soochow Law School, Zhou Zefu, Secretary-General, and Professor Wu Zhifang attended to provide guidance. The following resolutions were made: The three universities will send representatives to petition in Nanjing; The three graduating classes unanimously refuse the screening; Please ask alumni and students of each school to support the effort. Their reasons are threefold: The graduates of these three classes are now scattered in all directions, some are studying abroad, or have taken positions in the government, creating many difficulties. During the enemy and puppet regime period, many private schools in the occupied areas that registered with the puppet regime were not screened by the Ministry of Education and Youth, and have already been recognized. During the period of occupation, the three universities were forced to change their names due to duress, and did not register with the puppet regime, nor did they have any relationship with any enemy or puppet figures, so this screening seems unfair. The responsible persons of each school stated that it is quite difficult to conduct the screening at this time, and they promised to forward the opinions of the graduates to the Ministry of Education and strive for justice.

### Nanyang Welcomes Domestically Produced Cotton Cloth - Sales Prospects Extremely Promising - Bank of China Also Approves Low-Interest Loans to Manufacturers

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a representative from the Singapore China National Products Association, our country's calico, especially 12-pound fine cloth, has recently had remarkably smooth sales in the Nanyang region. Among them, places such as Singapore, Penang Island, and the Dutch East Indies, where overseas Chinese are concentrated, have particularly broad sales markets. Monthly sales of one million to two million [illegible character] are not difficult. The first batch of cotton cloth from the Fangjian Company trial-sold in the Philippine Islands also had good results. According to estimates, if transportation, sales, exchange, and trade conditions are normal, monthly sales could reach over four million yards. It is reported that the Bank of China in various parts of Nanyang has provided financial convenience to the domestic transportation and sales manufacturers for the domestic cotton products being transported and sold to Nanyang. Upon arrival, low-interest loans are approved, adding another boost to the sale of domestic cloth to Nanyang. Furthermore, before the war, Nanyang mostly used Japanese-produced cotton cloth. The weaving factories that produced these Japanese goods have now mostly been merged into our China Fangjian Company. After being taken over and reorganized, efforts have been made to improve them. The products are actually better than the pre-war Japanese goods. Therefore, they are well received in various parts of Nanyang. However, currently, the cloths sold to Nanyang are generally considered too narrow in width. Most shops have doors around 28 inches wide. The cloth width required in various parts of Nanyang is about 36 inches. The Fangjian Company is now actively planning to reorganize wide-width cloth to meet actual sales needs.

Moreover, there have been repeated rumors that a large batch of Japanese-produced cotton cloth has recently been transported and sold to Nanyang, giving a fatal blow to the sale of our country's cotton cloth to Nanyang. According to the representative, the Japanese-produced cotton cloth currently sold in Nanyang is limited to a portion used by the Allied forces and the British government for barter, so the quantity is very small. The only advantageous condition for this barter of Japanese-produced cotton cloth is that the exchange rate is calculated according to the official price of US dollars, with each pound equal to US$4.02. The exchange rate for our country's cotton cloth sold to Nanyang, based on the current exchange rate, translates to approximately US$3.30 per pound. Therefore, in terms of exchange rate conversion, the export of our cotton cloth does suffer somewhat. Fortunately, the quantity of Japanese goods is not large, and the quality is not as good as our country's cotton cloth. If our exchange rate policy can be flexibly applied, even if Japanese goods are sold in large quantities in the future (which is actually impossible in the short term), our country's cotton cloth will still be able to compete with them, the representative said.

### Bank of China Announces Overseas Remittance Figures for October - Ministry of Finance to Ban Private Remittance Shops in South China

[Reported by this newspaper] The Bank of China recently announced the overseas remittance figures collected in October, totaling 34,616,974,458.64 yuan in national currency. The amounts for each region are as follows: New York 22,418,970,184 yuan; London 2,906,086,896.37 yuan; Havana 1,499,257,000 yuan; Sydney 195,448,716 yuan, Calcutta 261,926,843 yuan; Yangon 860,265,000 yuan; Singapore 34,220,000 yuan; Corollin 23,500,000 yuan; Penang 51,179,990 yuan; Saigon 49,160,528.52 yuan; Batavia 5,692,000,000 yuan; Other regions 624,959,300 yuan; The overseas remittance figures for November will also be concluded in a few days, but because the black market is growing daily, it is not as good as October. In order to reduce the scope of overseas remittance smuggling, the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank will find ways to ban the "private remittance shops" prevalent in South China. The original nature of this type of organization was postal, and it existed in the mid-Qing Dynasty, and it became more prevalent in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. Because overseas Chinese often carried foreign currency in their letters when they brought letters back to China in their early years, it became customary. As of today, it has become an important channel for overseas remittance smuggling. However, because these private remittance shops do not have a fixed form and organization, nor do they have fixed procedures, everything depends entirely on trust between individuals, so there are many drawbacks. Recently, several private remittance shops suddenly went bankrupt, and overseas Chinese in Nanyang suffered considerable losses.

### Secretary-General of the National Economic Council Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Paper Production Increase

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mr. Gu Quan, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. In the afternoon at 4 o'clock, a meeting was held at the Central Industrial Testing Institute to discuss the technical issues of increasing paper production in our country. Chen Taoxin, head of the Chemical Engineering Group of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Guidance, and paper industry representatives Jin Runxiang, Jin Liu Ji, and Lin Da, among others, attended the meeting. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that our country will produce 35,000 tons of newsprint next year, to be handled by the various district guilds. Because the quality of domestic products such as woolen blankets and copper wire cloth is relatively poor, imports will be restricted on the one hand, and factories will be actively built for domestic production, to be handled by the Paper Equipment Supply Committee. During the meeting, paper industry representatives requested that the wood pulp from foreign exchange goods purchased by the government be distributed to existing paper mills, starting from the fifth quarter. The above points were assigned to Chen Taoxin (convener), Lin Jueda, Chen Pengnian, Qian Ziyin, and others for detailed discussion, and close contact will be maintained with the National Economic Council at all times in order to achieve the goal of increased production as soon as possible. Furthermore, the Tainan Wood Pulp Factory, once negotiations are completed with the Sugar Corporation and a supply of bagasse is secured, will be able to produce 40 tons of wood pulp per day. Because our country currently lacks raw materials for papermaking, if this becomes a reality, it will make a significant contribution to the papermaking industry in our country. As for the issue of the cost of increasing paper production, according to experts, under this plan, production will increase and foreign exchange can be saved, so it is indeed a constructive plan.

### Two Babies

— by Arab Kahlil Gibran, translated by Shi Zhecun

A prince stood on the terrace of his palace, addressing a large crowd gathered for the occasion. He said, "Let me congratulate you and this entire fortunate nation, for a new prince has been born. He will inherit the name of my esteemed family, and you will justly boast of him in the future. He is a new heir of a noble lineage, embodying the glorious future of this nation. Sing and rejoice!" And the voices of the masses, filled with joy and gratitude, resounded in the sky with excited songs, welcoming this new tyrant who would rule the weak with cruel authority, exhaust the strength of Yemen, abuse their souls, and place the yoke of oppression upon their heads. For this destiny, these people were drunkenly singing and celebrating the health of this new Emir (an honorable title for Arab chieftains – translator).

Meanwhile, another infant stepped into life and into that nation. While those crowds were glorifying a future tyrant with songs, exalting the strong and making themselves even smaller, and while angels were weeping for the people's weakness and servility, a sick woman was lost in thought. She lived in an old, desolate hut, and lying on her hard bed, next to a newborn infant in a tattered swaddling cloth, was starving to death. She was a poor and pitiful young wife, forgotten by the world; her husband had already fallen into the trap of death set by the prince's oppression, leaving a lonely woman, to whom God had sent a small companion on this night to prevent her from working and supporting her life.

When the crowds dispersed and silence returned, this unfortunate woman placed the infant on her lap, looked at his face, and wept as if to baptize him with her tears. Then, with her voice weakened by hunger, she said to the child, "Why did you leave the world of spirits and come here to share the suffering of my earthly life? Why did you abandon the angels and the vast heavens and come to this miserable human world, filled with trouble, oppression, and cruelty? I have nothing to give you but tears; are you willing to be nourished by tears instead of milk? I have no silken clothes for you to wear; will my trembling, naked arms keep you warm? The small animals in the pasture have safely returned to their stalls after eating grass; the small birds have peacefully slept among the branches after pecking at seeds. But you, my child, have nothing but a loving, yet very poor mother."

Then she placed the infant against her withered chest, wrapping her arms around him, as if to make the two bodies remain as one as before. She slowly raised her fiery eyes to the sky, crying, "God! Have mercy, have mercy on my unfortunate countrymen!"

In that instant, the clouds parted from the moon, and moonlight shone through the small window above the door of the poor house, illuminating the two corpses. Kahm Gibran (1888-1931) was an Arab poet and painter, whom the great sculptor Rodin once likened to a modern Blake. In Europe and South America, he is often hailed as the Dante of the 20th century, while among young Arab poets, he is a beloved master. His works include "The Prophet" (translated by Bing Xin), "The Forerunner" (a few excerpts translated by Shen Zemin, published in Literary Weekly), and "The Madman" (a Chinese translation published by Beixin Bookstore, translator unknown), all collections of prose poems. The translator wrote a short essay introducing Gibran after his death, which is included in his book "Under the Lamp." This year, he acquired a newly published English translation of "Tears and Laughter," containing thirty poems and essays, from which this article is translated. Recorded and stored on December 15, 1947.

### Painting of Dawn Glow

— Ni Yide

Recently, at the faculty exhibition of the Art Academy, I saw two recent works by Mr. Lü Xiaguang. One depicts the Daxiong Palace of Lingyin Temple. The overall tone is somber and solemn. A few rays of light penetrate the dim masses, illuminating three golden Buddha statues, emitting a few flickering glimmers. The smallness of the monks moving on the ground further highlights the loftiness and grandeur of the Eastern temple architecture. The other depicts the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. In the quiet, still water, the ancient Three Pools stand. The nearby lake water ripples, and the background is a row of misty distant mountains. Faint clouds float in the sky, expressing a sense of serene tranquility of late autumn on the lake.

From these two works, one can see that Mr. Lü is striving to use the realistic techniques of Western painting to express the essence of Chinese style. His style belongs to the school of realism, faithfully depicting objective scenes. He does not seek exaggeration or novelty, but simply and intimately depicts everything he sees around him. In this steady expression, he reveals the honest and simple national character of the vast plains.

The important issue in Chinese Western painting today is not the old versus the new in technique, but how to apply the realistic techniques of Western painting to express the Chinese national spirit and local color. Only in this way can we break away from Western imitation and create art that can represent the Chinese national character. Therefore, Mr. Lü's tendency in painting is worthy of our attention.

About Pushkin

This spring, the Soviet Union held commemorative meetings and exhibitions in Moscow, Leningrad, and other cities to mark the 110th anniversary of the death of the poet Alexander Pushkin. The Postal and Telecommunications Bureau also issued a special commemorative stamp. To this day, Pushkin remains one of the most widely read writers in the Soviet Union. From 1917 to 1947, his works were translated into 75 languages, with a total circulation of 32,472,000 copies.

Two new operas based on Pushkin's works have also been staged in Moscow theaters. These are "The Country Lass" by Moscow composer Yuri Biryukov and "The Tale of the Dead Princess" by Ural composer Vakov Chernyak. The libretto for the former was written by the famous authority Sergei Purylin.

Pushkin's works have become a source of inspiration for many Soviet composers. For example, Glinka's "Ruslan and Ludmila," Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin" and "Queen of Spades," Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov," Dargomyzhsky's "Mermaid," and Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Tale of Tsar Saltan" and "The Golden Cockerel."

The Pushkin Museum in Leningrad has reopened after a five-year hiatus. The location is 12 Moika Street, where the poet spent his last years; he died there after being wounded in a duel. Pushkin's room has been well preserved, just as it was when he was alive: his furniture, desk, inkstand, books, etc., all in their original state. At 2:45 p.m. on February 10, a delegation observed a minute of silence in this place, and a band formed during Pushkin's time played in the house.

Pushkin drew more than two thousand pictures and pencil sketches, all with detailed annotations, which are collected in the seventeen-volume complete works. The poet was fond of painting, and his manuscripts are often filled with sketches, some related to the themes of his poems or stories. Pushkin's drawings were first publicly displayed in 1837, after the poet's death. The Sovrenennik magazine published a poem by Pushkin, along with a sketch of a monk praying.

Tsyavlovosky gave a detailed speech about the poet's meeting with Nicholas I in 1826. He said that after the poet was exiled, he requested the Tsar to allow him to be treated for his illness and to send him to St. Petersburg, Moscow, or abroad. His request was not answered for a long time. One day, an envoy came and summoned Pushkin to Moscow to meet the Tsar. After Pushkin met with the Tsar, he spoke without hesitation. He did not hide his sympathy for the Decemberist rebels of 1825. He said directly that if he had been in St. Petersburg that day, he would have been "with the rebels." The Tsar asked: "People say Kuchelbeker's rebellion was out of madness." Pushkin bravely replied: "Madness cannot be cured by exile."

### Friendship

— Zhao

I often think that I have nothing worth boasting about in my life. If there is one thing, it is that I have constantly enjoyed the warmth of friendship! Friendship nourishes me to live in this difficult time! Friendship is like a walking stick that supports me on one long and bumpy road after another. How many times have I fallen because of poverty, illness, or some evil force? It is friendship that has lifted me up again and urged me forward step by step!

What is particularly rare and precious is that the friendship I enjoy is pure friendship with no vested interests. Those who give me friendship have absolutely no ulterior motives towards me. It comes purely from a heartfelt and noble sense of love! Because of this, I respect them more than I respect my relatives and family.

They include friends who are as poor as I am! Servants who are poorer than I am; and also my students. The warmth they give me is both spiritual and material.

Spiritual warmth is that they can deeply understand me, understand my thoughts, understand my character, understand my interests, and understand my feelings. Therefore, they do not force me to do what I do not want to do. They are considerate of me, trust me, far above any of my relatives and family. They make my soul never feel lonely or isolated.

Material warmth is the external manifestation of friendship, but it is also closely related to spiritual warmth. They know that I am poor, and they also know that I am tough in my poverty. Therefore, they do not send me money to spend, but often unexpectedly send me what I need. These things are not expensive, but despite costing very little, they not only help me solve practical needs, but also have greater commemorative significance, as well as the effect of encouragement and comfort. Wen often jokingly and admiringly says: "You can't be embarrassed! As long as your friends are alive, you will never go hungry or freeze." That's right. My friends (including my husband, students, and servants) treat me too well! From the time I left home at the age of sixteen, I have been living on the support of friends! The first person to help me the most in my studies was Wen! Her help was more spiritual than material. Without her, I might still be locked up at "home." So I have an unforgettable gratitude for her. In addition, what moves me most is the help of friendship in several hardships. I remember that in Kaifeng, I was falsely accused and imprisoned. At that time, my husband, students, friends, and my servants all sent me supplies and food, so that even though I was in prison, I could still sleep on a folding bed and have good dreams; eat bread and fill my belly; truly, it was great fortune in misfortune. Also, seven years ago, I was seriously ill in northern Sichuan. My old friend Yun Wei disregarded his own poverty and bought me an expensive and effective antipyretic drug, which turned the tide. My student Pei accompanied me by my bedside day and night, exhausting his mind and body. Even now, when I think about it, I am filled with gratitude and shame! What did I give them? After the victory, I had no funds to return to my hometown. I drew a few paintings, which Brother Zhu sold on my behalf, fulfilling my wish to return home. After that, the victory brought me great sorrow. Without the support of friendship, I'm afraid I would have collapsed long ago!

This spring, I received a coat from Ying sent from the United States, which made me feel that I had a guarantee for the winter. A few days ago, I received a pen that Wengru entrusted someone to bring me from New York. This is the fourth pen my friends have given me. After losing three pens one after another, this replacement encourages me to continue writing! Last week, Brother Jun came to see me and told me: "Since you insist on maintaining your integrity and don't intend to step out of your small room, then I am willing to paint it for you, so that it is more beautiful, and you are more content to squat down!" I did not object, so Brother Jun fulfilled his promise. My student Hui, seeing that I was wearing thin clothes, personally knitted me a sweater, which I added to the one Xiaoman knitted for me last winter. The severe cold shrank away from me, and I felt a double layer of warmth, both material and spiritual.

Now, I am sitting in a newly painted study; wearing the cold-weather clothes sent by Man and Hui; holding the Fifty-One pen sent by Ru and writing this short essay. I am both gratified and sad! Coincidentally, someone sent two loads of charcoal. So I lit the brazier. My heart felt like it was about to burst, and my tears fell drop by drop into the ashes! I cannot describe my mood at this time. I truly feel that friendship is great! Friendship is like a fire; a lamp. It ignites the strength of my life; it illuminates the eyes of my soul; it gives me the courage to stand up and live; it makes me see clearly the path I should take!

I am already very satisfied. Friendship gives me a very comfortable place to live, and friendship gives me warm clothes to wear. Obviously, I am eating my own blood, and my servant is willing to cook for me dutifully. What else do I ask for? I am really happy enough, worthy of pride!

### Two Topics on Painting - On Painting

— Lin Fengmian

To Wuji (Zhao Wuji's oil painting exhibition, from the 26th to the 31st of this month, at the Daxin Company)

I think what mankind pursues and expresses in art is the harmony between mankind's ideals and matter, that is, the harmony between life and the universe. The statues of the Greeks make us feel the meaning between God and man in such harmony.

An artist's creation is always fought out with the strength of his whole life. Wuji is walking the arduous and long road of art. I still remember his works in his personal exhibition when he left Chongqing. He used his own sincerity and kindness, and passionate impulses, to express the feelings he obtained from natural things with the innocence of a child, the simplicity of a primitive man, and the freshness of form. After returning to Hangzhou from Chongqing, he lived in the mountains of West Lake for many years of difficult resistance life, and obtained a relatively quiet life of rest. In the quiet, he had the opportunity to re-examine his own creation. Therefore, in the road of creation, he also re-opened a newer, more arduous, and longer road.

I think this is just the beginning of his suffering. After the exhibition, he is going to Europe, he is going to France, he is going to throw himself into the torrent and whirlpool of emerging art in Paris. He has to start struggling in the torrent and rolling in the whirlpool. He has to use all his strength to bring back new and valuable things to us.

I am very clear now that the small and pitiful things we bring back are not easy to do anything for the tradition of Chinese art as a whole, but there is one thing, this small and pitiful thing may give us the power to re-recognize Chinese art, thus feeling the miserable situation of Chinese art after the Tang and Song dynasties. It is determined that the reason for the continuation of this miserable situation is that in our feelings, not only have we not re-liberated ourselves from the forms we have obtained from the past traditions, but we have also not added anything to it.

What we bring is only a little color and the appearance of realism. I hope that Wuwang is in Europe, I hope that many new artists, because of your spirit of struggling in the rapids and whirlpools, will give a thunderous shock to the miserable situation of Eastern art, and revive it like the fire of the Greek god.

### Ode to Santa Claus

— Hanfu

You come just in time, my powerful north wind, from the shrinking human body drops over the steel skin. For you, the snow and the early days for your feet, silver frost transports the night. The brush densely lays how many people laugh, laughing down the verdant freedom of the small cypress tree, but its half erects the dazzling dream of candlelights.

You are too generous, so many gifts fill the streets and windows, magnificent, all for the sake of massively sacrificing "0"s in banknotes.

You are also too compassionate, although the world is full of stiff shadows and the season is so cold and desolate, you still give the feast additional dishes and flavors, embellishing the brocade hall, and adding glory.

Even giving a jade brooch to the silk lapel under the gold necklace.

Your age is not too old, although there is frost between your eyebrows, your temples like clouds. The rich will dress you up, more quietly year by year. What about the poor? Waiting for you to take them to heaven, they can't wait a lifetime.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Probably it's some new Tokyo thing, a professional assassination squad!" Pingzi smiled shallowly. After speaking, she pursed her pretty and bright red small mouth again.

"No, I'm asking about the lady sitting in the back of the car." He Jian spoke ambiguously.

"Oh, her?" A series of giggles rose from Pingzi's throat, barely suppressing them: "She's an old friend of yours... Sister Chunzi... Forgotten so quickly?"

"Oh!" He Jian's memory wasn't that bad. As soon as he heard Pingzi say the name Chunzi, he immediately thought of the night when Konoe Beppu was exploring the "Seven Secret Weapons," that female swordswoman who bravely slashed at him with long and short swords, wasn't she Sister Chunzi in Pingzi's mouth? But she was wearing a veil at that time, who had ever seen her true face?

"When did she get in the car? Why didn't you formally introduce her to me?" He Jian felt a little rude.

"Big brother, don't make trouble"! A pair of jade-like soft hands stretched out from inside the car, reporting to He Jian's location in a very artistic way; this report also contained a secret code. Obeying alert codes is the duty of intelligence personnel.

"Sorry, Pingzi"! He Jian's trouble-making fell short again; after getting in the car, he had to make a few words to cover it up; "I didn't expect there was anyone else in the car, let alone that it was you"...

"Hmm"? Pingzi started the engine while driving the car onto the road, seemingly ignoring him as she uttered this "Hmm" sound. This sound was of course very sweet and crisp; because she had practiced music: "...Do you think you're the only clever one in the world? Is that it?"

"No, no, Pingzi"! He Jian still pretended to be very handsome, quickly saying with a smile: "I think I'm the only clumsy one in the world! If I wasn't clumsy, how could I not have guessed that there was someone in the car?"...

"But I saw your big brother's legs a long time ago... hee"—Pingzi smiled charmingly, probably her anger had subsided.

"It's a pity that my eyes are also very clumsy... and you were hiding in the car, so I had no way to see you." He Jian continued to cover up.

"Big brother, you've also studied optics, geometry, parabolas, straight lines, lines, what, what, you probably still remember them; don't you know that the angle of reflection of a mirror is directly related? I can see part of you in the mirror, of course you can also see part of me in the reflection." Pingzi talked a lot about academic principles, precisely to expose He Jian's cover-up and embarrass him a little as a small revenge.

"This is a bit of a wrong accusation against me." He Jian, talking about the situation in Tokyo, suddenly switched to the main topic, telling me this: "At that time, I really didn't think about the reason for the direct relationship between the angle of reflection in the mirror. In any case, my cover-up fell short again! ...But who is as meticulous as these goblin women?"

### Yearning for Christmas

— Jingwen

I remember when I was a child, I would see a type of "cigarette cards" that specialized in drawing children's scenes, commonly known as "cigarette pizi." Because I wasn't old enough to smoke cigarettes at the time, I can't remember which brand of cigarettes they came with. But I can still recall the yearning I felt when I saw pictures of playing with tops, admiring goldfish, setting off firecrackers, and carrying dragon lanterns. Even now, as I write this, that feeling still wells up inside me.

Those cards were printed in color lithography, and the colors were very vibrant (at least, they seemed so in my eyes at the time). The children's clothing and the background of the pictures, viewed with today's artistic eye, might seem very vulgar, but they fully expressed the peaceful and tranquil atmosphere of ordinary life at that time. And what I miss so much now is precisely this leisurely and happy way of life.

People in their early thirties now, although they have experienced some of life's hardships, can still recall some of the happy atmosphere of peaceful days in their childhood. Especially when it came to New Year's and other holidays, their young hearts were filled with joy. The New Year, in particular, was arguably the happiest time of the year for children. School was out early, and their bodies and minds seemed to be completely liberated. Things they couldn't usually eat, they could now eat as much as they wanted. However, at such times, the thought of eating was never at the forefront of their minds; all their excitement was focused on playing. Games like playing "Promotion Chart," tossing "Champion Red," rolling iron hoops, and kicking shuttlecocks never seemed to get old.

These kinds of games may still exist among children today, but I doubt whether today's children still have the same childlike innocence as the children of that time. In terms of the variety of games, there are certainly many more now than in the past. Just take toys, for example. Now there are airplanes, tanks, toy guns, dolls with moving eyes, toy cars, toy bicycles, and even toy trains with tracks. Back then, what I had was limited to wooden swords and clubs, mud dolls, and wooden bowls and wooden fish that can still be seen on stalls in front of the City God Temple.

But are children today happier in their hearts than children of the past? I believe that children's hearts are always the same. It's just that they were born at the wrong time; they can no longer enjoy the precious happiness of peaceful times. For most children today, the era of playing with mud dolls and kneading flour figures is long gone, but the hope of hugging a large doll has become a layer of gloom cast upon their fragile hearts. Even "cigarette cards" are no longer a treasure for children.

These days are the annual bustling Christmas season for Europeans and Americans. Although Christmas is a holiday with religious significance, it can actually be said to be Children's Day in European and American countries. Western children look forward to it just like we look forward to the New Year. But the meaning of Christmas for children seems to give them more elements of happiness than our New Year. Just think of Santa Claus and the Christmas tree, the two main programs that make up Christmas; aren't they all designed for children?

Regardless of a person's views on Christian religious beliefs, I don't think anyone would consider a holiday like Christmas to be completely meaningless, would they? In fact, Christmas is not just a simple religious program, but a product of the integration of Christian culture and European and American folk legends. For example, Santa Claus and the Christmas tree have no direct relationship with Christianity itself.

### Ten Secrets to Promotion

— Weiying

The year is coming to an end, and it's time for year-end evaluations at various institutions, companies, and factories. To be honest, who wouldn't want to hear news of a "promotion" at this time?

People who habitually look at life with cynical eyes might say, "Want a promotion? It's easy. Just learn to brag and flatter, and give your superiors a generous gift on every festival." These people are always dissatisfied with reality, but they are never willing to improve reality in a down-to-earth way. They look down on the people around them, as if they are the most noble—but in fact, given the opportunity, they would still be willing to get their hands dirty!

Recently, ten American personnel problem experts each proposed a kind of most effective "secret" to getting promoted. These ten secrets are all simple and practical and are by no means unfounded empty theories or self-righteous "cold words." I am urgently translating them for the reference of ambitious young professionals.

If you want a promotion, you must pay the "price" of your promotion. — That expert said, "At a Harvard alumni reunion, I ran into an old classmate. Twenty years ago, he was considered by all the teachers and students at the school to be someone who would definitely have great development, but he is still just a small clerk in a bank. He was unwilling to pay the "price" of promotion, because every day he hurriedly finished his official business at five o'clock and went straight home; the "price" of promotion is doubled hard work, work outside of office hours, and resolutely and completely fulfilling one's responsibilities, but he was unwilling."

Choose a job that you are good at, and once you have chosen it, do not be fickle. And the most important thing is not to only choose easy jobs!

Consider the interests of your colleagues; don't just focus on your own department and not care whether others can handle it after you hand it off.

Before starting work, first set a plan—then make up your mind that you must implement every detail of the plan.

If difficulties arise, you should quickly record them in writing—this is the most effective way to avoid shirking responsibility and causing confusion. Once your superiors see your report, they will know how to adjust the work.

Be frank and approachable; don't deliberately try to please others, and even less should you specialize in counting on your colleagues—what you should do, you must do; what you shouldn't do, you must never do. You should try your best to help others with personal matters, but "official business" must be "handled officially"!

Have the power to push forward—the power to push forward is what people generally call "魄力" (魄力: boldness and determination). Many honest, cautious, and meticulous people cannot get promoted; the problem is that they do not have the power to push forward, cannot correctly judge the abilities of their colleagues, and cannot properly coordinate and use them. Therefore, they can never be the head of a department.

Avoid taking the easy way out and shirking responsibility. If a mistake occurs, have the courage to admit it frankly; of course, you must also have the determination to correct it.

Choose a career with "learning opportunities"—always learn, always improve, and never join a company or factory that only employs "family members."

If you are already the head of a department, then the most important thing is to be able to let your subordinates do things freely; do not be too hands-on in everything. Your intentions may be good, but everyone's "emotions" will be lowered as a result.

### On the Tactics of Liangshan Marsh

— Xuexue

Commander Fu has guarded the Ping Sui line as solidly as a town wall, and all the "road demolition experts" have no way to use their methods on other lines. This is because, although Commander Fu adopts a pacification policy towards the local people (in order to deal with the other side's efforts to win over the masses), he adopts a strict policy towards road protection. Within the warning line along the railway line, anyone who violates it is immediately killed. Regardless of whether it is a civilian who accidentally enters or a strategically planned infiltration by the other side, as soon as a shot is fired or an arrest is made, the Northwest line has always been impenetrable. The reason why the Northeast (Ping Pan) and Southwest (Ping Han) lines are destroyed from time to time is that the warning lines are not dense enough and there are too many concerns.

Mixing with the people and appearing and disappearing unpredictably is the "tactic of Liangshan Marsh." Anyone who has read "Water Margin" will understand it. The three attacks on the Hu Family Village, buying off insiders, the disguised wine sellers who cleverly seized the birthday tribute, and the programs such as Daming Prefecture and the Merchants' Association are all profitable because of "surprise attacks" and "scattered ambushes." In the battles against the Liangshan government army, Guan Sheng, Suo Chao, Huyan Zhuo, and others only had the so-called "堂堂之陣，正正之旗" (堂堂之陣，正正之旗: imposing formations and upright banners), so they were repeatedly tricked, either captured or forced to surrender. Not only in "Water Margin," but also in the "Three Kingdoms," Guan Yu's might shook China, and Cao Cao almost moved the capital to avoid his advance, while Eastern Wu's Lü Meng "crossed the river in plain clothes," disguising himself as ordinary people to disturb the rear, completely collapsing Guan Yun Chang's mighty formation.

The official history says, "Song Jiang led thirty-six people to rampage across Hebei, plundering ten counties, and the government army did not dare to confront him." Therefore, the author of "Water Margin" wrote many special tactics of "rampage" and "plunder." It seems that there is no way to deal with such tactics. Therefore, the historian Zhang Shuye suppressed Song Jiang by "using spies to observe his direction. Jiang went straight to the coast, robbed ten large ships, loaded them with loot, and Shuye recruited a thousand daredevils, set up an ambush near the city, and sent out light troops to resist the sea, luring them to fight. First, strong soldiers were placed beside the sea, waiting for the troops to join together, raising a fire to burn their ships. When the bandits heard this, they all lost their will to fight, and the ambush troops took advantage of this to capture their deputy bandit. Jiang then surrendered." It can be seen that Shuye's tactics were precisely to fight poison with poison, using the Liangshan tactics to defeat them. He used spies, sent out scouts, used daredevil advance troops, set up ambushes, carried out deceitful tactics to lure the enemy, disrupted their camp, and eliminated their fighting spirit. It was definitely not "堂堂之陣，正正之旗" (堂堂之陣，正正之旗: imposing formations and upright banners), but rather "以其人之道，治其人之身" (以其人之道，治其人之身: to treat a person as he treats others), so he succeeded.

Fu has already achieved "坚壁清野" (坚壁清野: to fortify the walls and clear the fields) in the "defense" aspect of the area; as for the steps of the attack, although he told reporters that it was a military secret and inconvenient to disclose, as the newspaper said, "we must take advantage of the other side's weaknesses" and "popular cooperation," it can be seen that he "knows himself and the enemy," or follows Zhang Shuye's approach.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 5: Unexpected Disaster (22)

It turned out that this house facing Shichahai Lake was where Lin Futian secretly kept his mistress. Qi Wan would live here every time she came. That night, Futian personally went to Xiaochang Hutong to pick up Qi Wan. The two of them were chatting in the room, just about to prepare for bed, when an unexpected storm arose. Madam Lin led her "female soldiers" to raid the place at night. Futian's wife was extremely jealous by nature. Futian's meteoric rise to his current position was entirely due to his brother-in-law Shen Yi. Because of this relationship, Futian usually treated his wife with both respect and fear. Since he met Qi Wan, every time he stayed out, he always excused himself by saying that he was on official business and could not go home. Madam Lin was very vain and, for the sake of Futian's career prospects, was unwilling to stop him, though unwilling in her heart. Recently, she noticed that Futian was not home for eight out of ten days and was acting suspiciously, which inevitably aroused her suspicion. After inquiring everywhere, she learned that Futian was having an affair. This made her extremely angry. That night, she discovered that Futian and Qi Wan were meeting at their residence in Shichahai, so she led her male and female servants and rushed to the door. The gatekeeper, Old Li, had just opened the door and asked, "Who are you looking for?" when Madam Lin, in her extreme anger, slapped him in the face. The servant behind her then shouted, "Madam Director is here, don't you know?" The title "Madam Director" was Madam Lin's most cherished title. She called herself Madam Director to everyone, and the servants also called her Madam Director. Old Li had long been familiar with it. When he heard that it was Madam Director, he was so frightened that he ran inside to report. He knocked on the door and shouted, "Director! Madam Director is here!" Futian immediately panicked and hurriedly told Qi Zhi to hide. Qi Wan was stubborn by nature and was usually very resentful. Under these circumstances, she refused to submit and coldly smiled, "Didn't you say that this is my home? Since this is my home, I am the mistress of this house. Your wife is here, so of course I should greet her. Why should I hide?" Futian pleaded, "She's not that kind of person. It's better for you to hide for now." Qi Wan twisted her body, turned her head to the side, and said, "Why should I hide from her?" At this time, Madam Lin was already standing outside the door, banging on the door with a deafening noise. Futian pleaded again and again, but Qi Wan just stood upright in front of the window, her arms crossed in front of her chest, lowering her head and ignoring him. Madam Lin was outside and saw that the door could not be opened. In her impatience, she grabbed a small stool and smashed it against the glass. With a crash, the entire large glass window was shattered! Qi Wan was standing in front of the window, and a shower of broken glass fell on her head. Qi Wan cried out in pain, and her face, hands, and arms were injured in several places, with blood flowing profusely. Futian was shocked and rushed over to ask her how she was. He took out a handkerchief to wipe the blood from her forehead. Madam Lin was outside the window and saw that Futian dared to embrace the woman inside the house, so she couldn't help but shout, "How dare you, you audacious slave!" Disregarding her own safety, she grabbed the broken part of the window with both hands and stretched her head inside. The two legs behind her were helped up by the servants, and she climbed in.

### A Lazy Man's Defense

— Zeshi

I am naturally lazy, and lately even more so. These past few days, the weather has been unusually cold, so I simply don't want to get out of bed. My wife then started complaining, saying, "Do you think you're Zhuge Liang, lying in bed all day, waiting for Liu Bei to come and visit you three times? It's getting cold, the year is coming to an end, and you're still not going out to take care of things, to get some firewood and rice. You're such a waster!"

I am a lazy man, and I don't deny it. Whether my laziness ultimately brings misfortune or good fortune to me and my family is difficult to say. If we consider that I lie in bed all day and no one sends me gold and money, so my wife can't play mahjong, then my laziness is of course a misfortune for her. But if we consider that I don't have to run around in the cold wind on the streets, squeeze onto trams, and see the faces of strangers I don't like, then my laziness is a blessing for me.

But in any case, laziness is better than not being lazy. If I were to suddenly become unlazy, getting up at dawn and running around on the streets, what good would come of it? In the current world, starting a family through diligence and thrift is already an "outdated" and "stubborn" idea. Getting something for nothing is the "modern" way to be "suitable for the times." I believe that the wealth of today's rich people is all made in bed, or at least obtained while sitting in a reclining chair at home. According to a friend who often visits speculation venues, whenever a "big player" makes a "move," they always do it with a phone call. Only the "retail investors" who are "grabbing crumbs" come from afar and personally trade, but the profits of the former are ten or a hundred times greater than those of the latter. This one example is enough to summarize the rest.

This is to say that laziness is harmless to oneself. If we consider it in relation to others, then the benefits of laziness for the people are even more significant. I often think that the world's disasters are caused by the fact that the world's great politicians are particularly lacking in laziness. If Hitler had been just a little lazy and had been too lazy to attack Poland after annexing Austria, the Second World War would not have happened. If the Japanese militarists had been just a little lazy and had been too lazy to bomb Pearl Harbor, things would have been much simpler. To take a more recent example, if Marshall Molotov had had a fraction of my laziness, saying that it was too cold and the road was too long, and I didn't want to go to London, then the Four Foreign Ministers Conference could have been canceled. If it hadn't been held, it wouldn't have ended in disagreement, and if it hadn't ended in disagreement, we could have avoided many terrible consequences.

I sincerely pray that the world's great and powerful leaders will become more and more lazy, lazy to build up their military forces and lazy to call for world peace. I always hope that in the near future, when the United Nations holds a general assembly, no representatives will attend, because the representatives are all too lazy to get out of bed and too lazy to go to the meeting place to engage in verbal battles, arguing until their faces are red and their ears are burning, ending in disagreement, and sowing the seeds of future military action. …

As for myself, although I am not a great and powerful leader who commands the wind and clouds, I should still continue to be lazy, because once I am no longer lazy, I will inevitably, in a small way, take some money from others and put it in my own pocket, or, in a large way, gradually become great through hard work, eventually causing trouble for everyone. Even if I occasionally have a whim to write a few words like these, I have decided to lie in bed from now on, dictating to my little dog, who will write them down and mail them.

### Snake

— Yili

Snakes, these slender animals that lack limbs, move so quickly and cunningly that they are truly frightening to look at. In reality, snakes are very intelligent, and some of them are very affectionate towards their keepers. According to a British friend, British women love snakes very much. As long as they are not poisonous, they like to hold them in their hands and stroke them, which shows the difference in perspectives between China and foreign countries.

In order to adapt to the environment, the limbs of snakes have slowly degenerated, and a few species still have traces of hind limbs. Its five senses are roughly the same as those of ordinary vertebrates. The eyes do not have eyelids, but are replaced by nictitating membranes, which cover the flexible eyes like curtains covering windows when resting. The tears produced all flow into the nasal cavity, so no one has ever seen a snake crying. The structure of a snake's ears is different from that of other animals. The main difference is that it does not have fleshy external ears, so some people mistakenly think that snakes do not have ears. In fact, its hearing is very keen. The nose of a snake is the most developed. The tongue is slender and soft, divided into two branches at the front end, constantly stretching and contracting, and is the main sensory organ when foraging for food.

Mice and frogs are animals that snakes love to eat, but snakes have small bodies. How can they swallow things that are thicker than their bodies? This is really a difficult and interesting thing. After capturing the prey, the snake uses its two hook-like teeth to firmly grasp it, and then slowly moves it, making sure that the head of the prey is swallowed first. When eating, the left and right mandibles alternately move forward, gradually making the food enter the oral cavity and even the body as a whole. Strictly speaking, the swallowing situation is that the snake's body is moving, and the food itself is not moving. If it eats a rather large animal, the head and neck are often swollen and pitiful, the scales stand up, and the blood vessels are so swollen that they look like they are about to burst, but it finally compresses the food into a slender thing like a sausage. People often say, "Man's heart is never satisfied, the snake swallows an elephant." It has this kind of attempt.

The trachea of a snake is very long and extends far to the front end of the oral cavity. When swallowing, it can also extend slightly beyond the lower jaw, so it can avoid suffocation due to compression. Animals often have special structures to compensate for their shortcomings.

### Newly Engraved Illustrated Popular Narrative: Wine and Blood

— Bai Wuwen, Painting by Long Sheng

It is said that the literati of the Wei and Jin dynasties used wine to avoid disaster, thus leaving behind "romantic" stories such as "A New Account of Tales of the World," which are admired by later generations, and also lamented by later generations: lamenting the unfortunate fate of so many talented people who had to escape reality.

In fact, if one can have the opportunity to drink wine every day, even if it is not "romantic," but just a low-level stimulation of the senses, it is still enviable in our opinion. Because for the literati of Chongqing today, wine is as precious as blood.

Originally, in Sichuan, especially in Chongqing, hotels have always been the first priority in all businesses: even in remote alleys, there are one or two "cold dish" shops, and their number is definitely not less than in Shaoxing. But today, cultural people dare not even inquire.

The Chongqing Goods Tax Bureau has formulated a special law, requiring each winery, regardless of size, to station one factory inspector in the factory in order to collect taxes, and their salary and food expenses are to be borne by the factory. This new burden is of course passed on to the consumers. How can wine not be expensive? — But this is not an order from the Ministry of Finance, it is a system unique to Chongqing. Merchants are sensitive, and before it was implemented, the price of wine jumped up fiercely.

The wife of a writer was critically ill and needed a blood transfusion. Blood was available, but he couldn't afford it, so he had to take turns giving blood from his own body. His wife recovered, but his own blood level dropped, and he needed to drink a little wine to have the energy to work. But he found buying wine as difficult as buying blood. He could only drink heavily when he had money, but he often got so drunk that he lost consciousness, making it difficult to work. When he had no money, he had no wine to drink, and he couldn't get his spirits up.

Since the beginning of history, literati have been poor; however, wanting to drink a little wine is as difficult as getting bird's nest and shark fin soup. I'm afraid this is "not something to be counted on"!

Long Sheng drew a picture of "Drunkenly Beating the Mountain Gate" and asked me to write an inscription. I wrote the Guan Hanqing's [關漢卿; Yuan dynasty playwright] "Stripped Bare, Naked and Daring" from a Yuan dynasty song from the Northern Tune "A Parasite" on it. However, I originally wanted to write the original sentence from "Water Margin," "These days, I have only asked the wine shop to eat vegetarian food, and my mouth is bland." But in the end, I didn't write it. But if I had written it, these few words would not only make people feel close, but also make all the good men in the world—all sentient beings—cry together!

### Explanation from the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau Regarding the Electricity Saving Charging Method

Recently, this column has received letters from readers asking for clarification on the penalty methods for saving electricity, and asking for investigation and disclosure. We have requested an explanation from the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, and we have received a very detailed reply. We have excerpted it below as a response.

For ordinary lighting and heating electricity users, the standard electricity consumption is 40 kilowatt-hours per month (electricity meters under the same household name are calculated together), limited to the highest electricity consumption in the three months of March, April, and May of this year. The electricity rate within the standard kilowatt-hours is charged according to the prescribed electricity price; the portion above the standard but within the limit is charged at six times the prescribed electricity price; the portion exceeding the limit is charged at four times the prescribed electricity price for the first time, six times the prescribed electricity price for the sixth time, and for the third time and more, in addition to the six times charge, power outages may be imposed depending on the severity of the circumstances.

(Example) The highest electricity consumption of a certain household in the three months of March, April, and May of this year is 100 kilowatt-hours, then its electricity consumption limit is 100 kilowatt-hours, and the electricity consumption standard is 40 kilowatt-hours (for those whose electricity consumption is less than 40 kilowatt-hours in the three months of March, April, and May, 40 kilowatt-hours will be uniformly used as the electricity consumption standard and limit). Suppose the electricity consumption of the household in November of this year is 120 kilowatt-hours, and the prescribed electricity price is 5,000 yuan per kilowatt-hour, then the electricity bill below the standard is 40 kilowatt-hours multiplied by 5,000 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan, the electricity bill above the standard but within the limit is 60 kilowatt-hours multiplied by twice 5,000 yuan, totaling 600,000 yuan, and the electricity bill exceeding the limit is 20 kilowatt-hours multiplied by four times 5,000 yuan, totaling 400,000 yuan, totaling 1.2 million yuan (plus an additional 10% surcharge). If the electricity consumption in the next month still exceeds the limit, then the electricity price for the portion exceeding the limit will be charged at six times the prescribed rate.

For ordinary commercial lighting and heating electricity users, the standard is 70% of the limit (for example, if the electricity consumption limit of a commercial user is 300 kilowatt-hours, then the standard is 210 kilowatt-hours), and the charging method is the same as for ordinary lighting and heating, except that 3, 5, and 10 are substituted for 2, 4, and 6 times.

For special commercial users, the charging method is the same as for ordinary commercial users, except that the standard is 80% of the limit.
