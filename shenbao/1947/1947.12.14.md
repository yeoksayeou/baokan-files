### Legislative Yuan Debate on Postal and Telecommunications Price Increases, Petitioning the National Government to Halt Implementation, Various Committee Members Vigorously Defending the Spirit of the Rule of Law

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] Whether the adjustment of postal and telecommunications rates without completion of legislative procedures by the Legislative Yuan is legal became the most intense issue at the 342nd regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 13th. Legislators spoke enthusiastically and passionately, with a majority advocating for a halt to the price increases. Subsequently, Wang Yunwu, Deputy Premier of the Executive Yuan, arrived at the Legislative Yuan on behalf of Premier Zhang to provide an explanation. Tao Fengshan, Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications, was also present for consultation. After three hours of debate, it was ultimately resolved to petition the National Government to instruct the relevant authorities to halt the implementation of the postal rate adjustment order issued on November 10th and to order the Executive Yuan to submit the case to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation.

Today's meeting was chaired by Liu Kejun, Chairman of the Legal System Committee, in place of Premier Sun, who was attending a meeting of the Central Standing Committee. As the agenda began, Wang Yuxiang immediately initiated criticism, expressing dissatisfaction with the relevant authorities for disregarding the Legislative Yuan's recommendations and hastily increasing postal and telecommunications rates. Legislators spoke up in succession. Chen Guyuan angrily pointed out that Premier Zhang had stated his respect for legislative power upon taking office, but the Executive Yuan's current actions were unprecedented even during the era of Song Ziwen's cabinet, clearly indicating the Executive Yuan's disregard for the Legislative Yuan. He believed that the Legislative Yuan had become a spent force, hence this impatient action, unaware that it would be criticized as illegal. Deng Hongye also believed that Premier Zhang, having been in office for less than a year, had done something that no previous Premier had done, completely contradicting his statements of respecting legislative power, and requested an explanation from the Executive Yuan. Chen Zifeng was even more vehement, suggesting that the case be referred to the Control Yuan. Tan Tiwu believed that the spirit of the rule of law must be vigorously defended, and from a legal standpoint, no one should engage in illegal actions, advocating for the declaration of the order as invalid according to the law and seconding the motion to invite Premier Zhang to the Legislative Yuan to provide an explanation. The above motion was approved by the entire Legislative Yuan, and Secretary-General Lou telegraphed Premier Zhang to come to the Legislative Yuan.

Around 10:45 AM, Deputy Premier Wang Yunwu arrived at the Legislative Yuan on behalf of Premier Zhang, explaining the process of the Executive Yuan's measures, pointing out that postal and telecommunications services were incurring significant losses, increasing the burden on the national treasury. In order to achieve self-sufficiency, frequent adjustments were necessary. He cited the precedent of the promulgation of the Banking Law, where a clause regarding the suspension of bank closures requiring judicial procedures was temporarily suspended. The Executive Yuan requested authorization from the State Council to grant a temporary special permission for the postal and telecommunications price increases to be adjusted at any time. As for the current order, it was issued by the State Council, then instructed to the Ministry of Communications by the Executive Yuan, and then transmitted to local post offices by the Ministry of Communications for implementation. Due to the vastness of the area, the order had already been issued. This was the factual process. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan absolutely respects the law and values legislative power, and this action had no other intention.

After Wang's explanation, legislators questioned him one after another. Chen Guyuan pointed out that citing the precedent of the Banking Law was inappropriate. It was not unprecedented to complete legislative procedures retroactively after prematurely increasing prices. The Executive Yuan's hasty action had malicious intent from the start, inevitably inviting the criticism of "what is in the heart is written in the policy," and could not be said to be complying with the law. Wang Shixian inquired whether the handling of this matter was so rapid and hurried, as if it were extremely urgent, whether the postal economy would be inconceivable without it. The National Reconstruction Special Contribution only concerned a small number of people, but it was repeatedly discussed and has not yet been implemented. The postal rate increase affects the entire population, yet it was implemented so hastily, which is illogical. Furthermore, while the Ministry of Communications emphasizes increasing revenue, has it exerted its utmost efforts to reduce expenditure? Post offices are extensively engaged in construction in various locations, postal workers receive generous salaries, and there are many redundant personnel. Why not start with food conservation? Wang Yuxiang said: If laws can be changed by order, why can't orders be changed by order? (Using a National Government order to change the postal and telecommunications price increase order of November 10th?) Democratic politics is troublesome politics. If the Legislative Yuan is considered troublesome, why not abolish it? Zhong Tianxin pointed out the importance of this matter, requesting the Executive Authorities to pay attention. If such behavior occurs in the future after the constitution is implemented, legislators can request the resignation of the Premier of the Executive Yuan.

At this point, Sun Jiulu proposed a compromise solution, hoping that the Executive Yuan would immediately order a temporary price increase for a certain period, and then submit it to the Legislative Yuan for a remedy. Deputy Premier Wang also stood up to explain that the Executive Yuan had absolutely no intention of violating the law or disrespecting the Legislative Yuan, and recounted the hardships of adopting this measure. The legislators were still not satisfied, believing that the people could still send letters at the original price, and if the post office considered them underpaid, the people could file a complaint. Lin Bin explained that authorization should be based on the law, in a legal manner. The State Council cannot authorize; the Executive Yuan can directly submit a proposal to the Legislative Yuan. There are many precedents for this. To avoid increasing trouble for itself, the Executive Yuan can directly submit it to the Legislative Yuan. After the legislators finished questioning, Wang Yunwu intended to withdraw. Some legislators advocated for inviting Premier Zhang to the Legislative Yuan, and the debate was quite heated. Wang and others finally withdrew at 12:20 PM. The legislators continued to discuss, and based on Lin Bin's suggestion, made a resolution to petition the National Government to instruct the relevant authorities to halt the implementation of the postal rate adjustment order issued on November 10th and to order the Executive Yuan to submit the case to the Legislative Yuan for secret deliberation. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

### Legislative Yuan Passes Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management in Afternoon Meeting, No Further Increase in the Number of Manchu Legislative and Supervisory Committee Members

The meeting continued at 2:30 PM and passed the following resolutions: The State Council's resolution regarding the supplementary regulations for party nominations is consistent with the original intention of Article 12 of the National Assembly Delegate Election and Recall Law and the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Member Election and Recall Law. The content of the supplementary regulations for party nominations is as follows: 1. Members of the Kuomintang, Youth Party, and Democratic Socialist Party participating in the National Assembly delegate and Legislative Member elections must be nominated by their respective political parties. 2. Registration nominations using elector signatures are limited to non-party members. Regulations on the Appointment of Personnel in the Transportation Industry. Central Bank Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. Our Manchu representative, Pu, requested that the precedent set by the Mongolian and Tibetan cases be followed and that the number of Manchu Legislative and Supervisory Committee members be increased. The case was handled in accordance with the review opinion, giving sympathetic consideration to the request. However, the number of Supervisory Committee and Legislative Committee members is already large, and it is proposed that no further increase be made, but that the relevant authorities can make de facto adjustments. Amendments to the Supervisory Committee Election Regulations. According to the review opinion, the Supervisory Yuan's request to amend Article 6 of the Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law regarding the candidate's signature portion has already been promulgated and need not be discussed further. As for the amendment of Article 7 of the same law and Article 2 of its implementation regulations, which stipulates that the administrative heads of each province and city concurrently serve as election supervisors, in order to prevent abuses, as the Supervisory Committee members often target administrative heads for impeachment, it is deemed inappropriate for administrative heads to concurrently serve. The principle is highly sympathetic, but the election supervisors for the Supervisory Committee of each province and city in this session have already been clearly appointed by the National Government, and it is not convenient to change them at this time. Finally, several supplementary budget proposals for the 34th and 35th years were passed. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. (The full text of the Central Bank Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management is listed on the left corner of page two.)

The Executive Yuan also approved the Food Circulation Management Regulations, stipulating that food should circulate freely in the provinces and regions along the Yangtze River in order to ensure an adequate supply. Food prices in various regions are now relatively stable.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Indian Ambassador Menon said: "The Sino-Indian Civil Aviation Agreement has been agreed upon by both the Chinese and Indian governments to be extended for three months from its effective expiry date of December 15th.

The Sino-Indian Civil Aviation Agreement was concluded in January 1943 and was the earliest of China's wartime foreign civil aviation agreements. Under this agreement, Sino-Indian air transport and flight personnel made the most exceptional contributions to air transport routes. The original agreement was scheduled to expire on December 15th this year. Future civil aviation agreements will be concluded between the Chinese government and the independent Indian government."

### Britain Replies to Sino-Soviet Note, Refuses to Discuss Japanese Peace Treaty in China

[Our Report] London, 13th Broadcast: Britain has explicitly rejected the Soviet Union's suggestion to hold a preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty in China in January next year and does not accept the proposal by China and the Soviet Union that the four major Pacific powers should have veto power. The British government sent notes to China and the Soviet Union, strongly advocating that the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted as soon as possible and that all decisions should be based on a two-thirds majority vote. The British side believes that it would be more convenient to convene this meeting in Washington, as various Far Eastern countries currently have specialists in Washington. Regarding the veto power issue in the Japanese peace treaty, the British side believes that if the interests of all participating countries are not taken into account on an equal footing, it would only delay the early signing of the treaty. The British government's note to China was worded more mildly, but it refused to accept the participation of all member states of the Far Eastern Commission in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty. It is inferred that Britain may intend to allow Burma to participate in this work as well.

### Handling American Relief Supplies, Our Plan to Be Submitted to the U.S. Soon, 30 Million in Relief Funds Insufficient

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] It is learned that the "Implementation Plan for Relief Using American Relief Supplies" being discussed by the Executive Yuan's American Relief Supplies Committee estimates that the total number of people in the country affected by natural disasters and banditry reaches 48.9 million, of which 12 million cannot survive without relief, 8.7 million are destitute, and 570,000 are currently receiving relief, totaling 21 million people who must be provided with relief. The food needed for the above three months is approximately 9.7 million tons. According to this estimate, the 30 million US dollars in relief funds will be insufficient. After this plan is submitted to the U.S. representatives, it may prompt them to pay attention and consider how to make U.S. relief assistance more effective. The work items in the plan are divided into three categories: 1. Temporary emergency relief, 2. Work relief, 3. Constructive relief, including increasing and supplementing relief agencies, establishing rehabilitation centers for the disabled and special children's guidance centers, and establishing small-scale affordable housing in major cities to address housing shortages in Nanjing and other cities.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to official sources: The Executive Yuan's American Relief Supplies Committee completed its plan for utilizing relief supplies on the 13th. A copy will be sent to Ambassador Stuart, who will forward it to the chairman of the China Relief Committee in Washington.

### Kowloon Natives in Hong Kong Hold Emergency Meeting, Resolve to Reject Hong Kong Government Summons

### U.S. Military Personnel in China Not Allowed to Take Beijing-Shanghai Trains, Travel by Military Transportation

All personnel traveling from Beijing to Shanghai are transported by military aircraft.

### Barter Policy with Japan to Continue Next Year, Central Trust Bureau Drafting Plan

[Our Report] The Central Trust Bureau is currently drafting a barter plan for Japan for next year, which will be handled according to the precedents set this year. Sino-Japanese barter began in the winter of the 34th year. It was initially handled directly by the Executive Yuan, and from April of the 35th year, it was continued by the Central Trust Bureau. To date, this barter has lasted for more than two years, and the transaction amount has been increasing daily. At that time, the Executive Yuan established this policy because it was participating in the Allied nations' joint restriction of trade with Japan, and all industries and mines were in urgent need of restoration after the victory of the War of Resistance, and Japanese equipment could supply our country's needs. Therefore, after the decision was made, it was immediately implemented, focusing mainly on importing industrial and mining equipment. (Continued on page two, column one)

### Communist Bandits Expand Raids in Eastern Henan, Weichuan and Weishi Fall, Fierce Fighting in Changge, National Army Deploys to Suppress Remaining Bandits in Dabie Mountains

[Our Kaifeng Correspondent, 13th] Based on the current situation, it seems likely that the Chen Yi bandit troops in eastern Henan, who have long been rumored to be planning a major invasion of Bian and Zheng, are indeed planning one. Yesterday afternoon, approximately 80,000 to 90,000 bandits from the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th, and 11th columns had infiltrated the Weishi, Chenliu, Tongxu, Taikang, and Minquan areas, forming a fan-shaped formation for an invasion of Kaifeng. Last night and this morning, there were local clashes with the National Army in the areas east of Zhuxianzhen and west of Chenliu (both more than 30 miles from Kaifeng). The city went under martial law at 9:00 PM last night, all entertainment and commercial telephones were completely shut down, security agencies scouted the area, and police patrolled the streets and alleys all night. Commander Liu Ruming of the Fourth Pacification Zone has led his troops to the Biantan area, and the people of the city are very calm. According to the military authorities here, Kaifeng has strong forces and solid defenses, and there is no cause for concern.

[Our Zhengzhou Correspondent, 13th] A bandit unit of approximately 10,000 bandits is currently raiding towards Chenliu, and another unit of several thousand bandits has captured Weichuan and Weishi. Another unit is engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in Changge.

Weishi, Weichuan, and Zhuxianzhen southwest of Kaifeng have been invaded by bandits. The main force of the bandits is now gathering east of Changge and northeast of Xuchang. At dawn this morning, a unit of bandits launched a probing attack on Changge, but after being met by the defending troops, they retreated in disarray.

[Our Xuzhou Correspondent, 13th] The National Army in Zhecheng has cleared out the scattered bandits in the suburbs.

The National Army has redeployed and believes that the prelude to the next major battle in the Dabie Mountain area will begin within days.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 13th] The remnants of Liu's 17th and 2nd columns, on the border of Henan and Hubei, failed to cross the Pinghan Railway and retreated back east of Jilong Mountain, currently waiting for an opportunity to escape on both sides of the Luoshan-Xuanhuadian highway. His 6th column fled northwest from near Huang'an to the Qiliping, Huangbeizhan, and Xuanhuadian line. On the night of the 12th, one unit secretly moved southwest, but they were defeated by the National Army and security regiments. The National Army is still closely monitoring and deploying to encircle and suppress all bandit troops in the area.

### Differences in U.S. Congressional Foreign Aid Bill, Joint Committee May Reach Agreement, Zhou Yide Criticizes U.S. Policy Toward China

[United Press, Washington, 12th] China's chances of obtaining temporary and long-term economic assistance from the United States became slightly clearer on the 12th, as two definitive developments emerged on the 12th, showing a glimmer of hope. Representative Zhou Yide said that he believes that after Congress reconvenes on January 6th next year, the State Department will submit a report on China's long-term needs. At the same time, according to friends in Congress with authority to visit, China may receive all of its $60 million in the temporary foreign aid bill, as the joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives has made some compromises, believing that this amount can be issued from other funds.

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, which is adjusting the differences in the temporary foreign aid bill passed by the two houses, decided today that $150 million could be advanced by the Development Banking Group and distributed to countries receiving temporary U.S. aid, but did not reveal whether China would share this right with France, Italy, and Austria.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] After the U.S. Senate and House Joint Committee held a meeting to adjust the emergency assistance measures of the Senate and House of Representatives and adjourned without results, Senator Vandenberg said that an agreement is expected to be reached before the evening of the 13th. This move indicates that the possibly accepted revised plan can be included in the final draft. It is reported that the House Republicans have opposed removing aid to China from the bill and restricting emergency aid to France, Austria, and Italy before the Senate has fulfilled the State Department's request for $300 million in aid to China. The compromise bill may: stipulate that the $590 million approved by the House of Representatives be modified to provide assistance to China, or simply state that Congress is willing to establish another aid to China bill as soon as possible.

[Another Dispatch] U.S. Representative Zhou Yide criticized the U.S. government's policy toward China today, calling it "hands-off." Zhou said that unless the government changes its policy toward China, Congress will question this matter. Some of his colleagues want to know the extent to which the U.S. work in China is being carried out. He also criticized the American Maritime Administration, saying that the agency has not yet delivered ships to China, and the payment for these ships has been proposed and can be paid at any time. Zhou accused the authorities of focusing on Europe in the case and ignoring the situation in the Far East. He believes that the only way to prevent Soviet aggression is to keep it restrained in both Europe and Asia. Zhou concluded by saying that unless the government corrects its policy, Congress will definitely investigate this erroneous diplomatic policy.

### Observing Xinjiang from a Historical Perspective (Part 1) - A Few Suggestions on Rewriting the History of Xinjiang -

I. To understand Xinjiang, I believe that the prerequisite is to understand its history. At least, there should be a systematic concept of the culture and social evolution of Xinjiang. If we want Xinjiang to have long-term stability and security, we should trust the effectiveness of objective knowledge and work from the root to guide the flow.

Therefore, I hope that an ideal general history of Xinjiang will be published soon. The philosophical point of view of this general history must be based on the progress of all mankind in the world and the relations between them. In terms of methods, it must be absolutely based on science; in terms of content, it must include all the classical historical materials of China and Islamic countries, as well as the research results of modern Chinese and Western scholars. Only by objectively grasping historical experience in this way can the world perfectly understand Xinjiang, recognize the image of the mainland, and regenerate the long-lost mainland civilization, giving it the new world status it deserves.

Of course, this work is extremely difficult and cannot be accomplished by the knowledge and experience of one or two people. According to the requirements of modern civilization, it is best to establish an international cultural cooperation organization to be responsible for it, so that it can calmly review all the general achievements of geology, geography, anthropology, ethnology, archeology, linguistics, and comparative religion from complex relationships, and then make a comprehensive synthesis. The history of Xinjiang can be introduced to the world with a purely scientific nature that does not carry any emotion. This is a higher ideal. If it is considered difficult, then take the second best approach and invite a group of people to Xinjiang as soon as possible to do some work. These people must have sufficient humility, be able to see the vastness of the world and understand the limits of themselves, and be willing to recognize the completion of their ideal work. At least, they must devote themselves tirelessly to pioneering work. Their readers are not specialized scholars in the world, but people who have a scientific point of view and historical sentiment towards Xinjiang, and the response and awakening of the broad society; as for Xinjiang, they should try to find more original materials, cooperate more with scholars of indigenous ethnic groups, consult more people, and learn the languages and cultures of Islamic countries, in order to establish a foundation of righteousness and an objective spirit in the complex border society, and to open up a path for those who will devote themselves to this in the future.

Although China has an amphibious territory, in the past hundred years, talents have gathered on the coast, and most Chinese people are only "half Chinese." In terms of their cultural potential, they only have half of the maritime nature, and the other half of the continental nature is paralyzed and has no chance to be cultivated and developed. It was not until Japan was defeated and the threat of the treaty ports, which had lasted for a century, was lifted that there was a chance to return to the interior. In the future, if we want to attach importance to the interior in terms of culture, we must first attach importance to Xinjiang, which is the most inland area in the country; because only Xinjiang has the kind of continental atmosphere and spirit that can cultivate a reverse of the atmosphere of wealth and luxury of the Southern Dynasties, and will increase unimaginable vitality and blood in cultural contact, and restore the half of the Chinese that has been paralyzed for a long time. Only Xinjiang is the only bridge between China and the world. If we want to survive in this world, we must walk to the world from this bridge. In the future, China will have to follow others in politics, economy, and society for a long time. Those with ambition must hope that in academics and culture, there can be a spontaneous cultural spirit, a way of being a person and a country that can be proud of, and our own worldview and views on the world order. Therefore, I also feel that the value of engaging in the history of Xinjiang cannot be described in words.

The lifeline of the Xinjiang issue should be entrusted to history, and the discussion of history must be based on the spirit of the times today. Looking around today, from a distance, there are tigers eyeing us covetously, and the country is in a difficult situation; closer, brothers are fighting each other, and refugees are everywhere. It seems that there is not much hope, but the meaning shown by the pointer of the times is not like this. In the distance of historical progress, there are still good times and beautiful scenery to be found, but it depends on whether we have the determination to reach the other shore. Therefore, discussing history becomes a struggle. We must seek a bright path in the struggle, break out of the narrow nets of various small worlds, and move towards the broad road. We must start from the base point of Xinjiang and establish our world spirit and cultural beliefs in all directions. If we can observe and act in this way, then the re-research work of Xinjiang history will not only have its significance of the times, but also become necessary.

Based on this kind of encouragement from the times, I would like to offer a few suggestions for reorganizing the history of Xinjiang:

The civilization of Xinjiang is a part of world civilization, and it must not be developed in isolation but must accept external influences. Therefore, to criticize any historical view involving Xinjiang, it must be done through the influence of the entire world civilization and not just from the perspective of one civilization.

Most of the existing historical materials of Xinjiang are products of the concepts and interests of various civilizations outside Xinjiang. They are all fragmentary impressions of a certain time and place. The boastful arrogance of a small kingdom is mostly unreliable, and after the event, they are even more worthless. Therefore, when sorting out historical materials, it is necessary to very objectively remove their subjectivity and reveal their incompleteness.

Based on the conclusions of comparative research, establish a comprehensive outline, and then place the cleansed data in their proper positions.

II. Four Stages of Xinjiang Civilization

Currently, there are four paths in the world to solve the history of Xinjiang, pointing to China, Islamic countries, the West, and the Soviet Union respectively. As long as we start to study the history of Xinjiang, we cannot avoid encountering these already traditional viewpoints, and it is easier to be unconsciously influenced by them. Therefore, we must firmly establish our position and attitude, and not cling to the past or blindly follow others in our minds, so that we will not fall into the nets of these small worlds. Bravely stand on the overall position of world civilization evolution and expand our broad vision. We must not only observe the history of Xinjiang from this aerial and condescending perspective, but also observe the history of China, Islamic countries, the West, and the Soviet Union with this aerial and condescending objective attitude. Only by doing our best to maintain this detached position can we discover which phenomena are helpful to the progress of the overall strategy, which phenomena are reactionary that hinder the evolution of the whole, and how to achieve the overall welfare of the world, and know what to follow.

When the light of world civilization was still limited to the shores of rivers and inland seas, the civilization of Xinjiang, like the light that appeared in other places, was very small in scope and mostly concentrated along the Tarim River. At this time, because there were few opportunities for various civilizations to interact with each other, they developed into different styles of isolated civilizations. Many ancient traditions and habits that are still preserved in the world today were formed at that time, and there has been no such peaceful environment since then.

Inland river and sea civilization developed to its peak, and various isolated civilizations emerged one after another, opening up territories and forming a surface. Iron soldiers and war horses formed the general trend of Xinjiang being surrounded. The Han civilization in the east, the major Middle Eastern empires and Greco-Roman civilization in the west, the Magadha Kushan Gupta Empire civilization in the south, and the Xiongnu Xianbei Rouran nomadic empires in the north all took the Xinjiang fortress as a hunting ground. In the rapid whirlpool of cultural exchange, Sima Qian in the east and Herodotus in the west first initiated historical writing. The two fathers of history observed Xinjiang from different angles. The naming of "Western Regions" and "countries outside of Yishan" initially formed the most basic classical historical materials of Xinjiang, and Xinjiang began to occupy a position in world civilization.

In this stage, Xinjiang inherited the legacy of Persia and Greece in culture, and adopted the form of reconciliation with the Han in politics. The Han people, who had the chivalrous spirit of the Warring States period, created great undertakings. The work of Duan Huizong in northern Xinjiang and Ban Chao in southern Xinjiang is a typical example of the oasis and grassland systems. Because these Han people had very high organizational abilities, the international armed peace of Xinjiang was also recorded for the longest time.

Nomadic peoples poured out from the remote grasslands in the north in large numbers. In the form of later waves chasing the former waves, they opened up continental transportation. World civilization expanded into a belt at the speed of war horses. A large number of camels and horses invaded Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and India from the lowlands on the north bank of the Caspian Sea, the Herat Gate, and the Iron Gate. Buddhism and Christianity traveled east and west separately. Under the control of the Kushan dynasty, Xinjiang became a part of the Buddhist international. Under the unprecedented prosperity of pantheistic art, scholars of the Sui and Tang empires and the Arab empires continued to write history. From the confrontation between Sima Qian and Herodotus in the past to the confrontation between Sima Guang and Tabari (Arab historian), the Sui and Tang people took Hexi as their base and looked westward; the Arabs took Khorassan as their base and looked eastward; coupled with the prospect of the Tuoba clan and Eastern Roman historians for the pastoral people in the north, the classical historical materials of Xinjiang were extremely splendid and chaotic.

The long-term prosperity of the continental period and the classical traditions of various ancient isolated civilizations have deeply constituted the different perceptions and habitual prejudices and illusions of the old world people towards Xinjiang. The Han people, who retreated to the Yangtze River basin, were still unwilling to give up their concept of the prosperous era and some heroism, legendary spirit, and feudal imperialism based on the Han and Tang traditions. Their attitude was one of expanding towards the mainland, and their historical view was one of continental defense. However, in fact, they had been retreating to the southeast for a long time, and their intellectuals had fallen into a state of complete incomprehension of the major events that had occurred in Xinjiang during the continental period, such as the cultural relics system of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, the Chagatai Khanate, and the Timur Dynasty. On the other hand, since the collapse of the ancient empire, the backward mentality of the historians of various Islamic countries has always been obsessed with the ideal of a large Islamic international, believing that only the Middle East and Central Asia are paradise for civilization, and exerting their isolationism of a small world, forever regarding the heretics and different cultures in other regions of the world as objects of religious and ethnic struggle. However, the continental stage of world history has come to an end, and Columbus, who could not be seen from afar, has landed on the New World. This is the tragedy of being out of touch at that time, the irony of history.

The 19th century was the peak of the oceanic era. At this time, China was even more forced to face the ocean with its back to the mainland in order to save its survival. India and Islamic countries also embarked on the fate of becoming colonies if they did not take the path of capitalism. However, even if their forms have changed, their concepts have not changed at all. They have already fallen far behind in world civilization, but they still want to rely on the remaining glory of the past to demand their historical rights. When Zuo Zongtang of China advanced westward and Sultan Abdol Hamid of Turkey launched his Pan-Islamic movement, they were still looking at Xinjiang from different angles, and they were full of megalomania and exclusion. This is the remote cause of many disharmonious oppositions in Xinjiang today.

Therefore, we must technically thoroughly examine whether the ideas lurking in these four historical views still contain various prejudices of the inland river and sea, continental, and oceanic periods, and estimate whether these remaining prejudices can still cause adverse cultural and social effects; then, we must examine from the opposite side how many subjective traditional factors still exist in Xinjiang society today. We must fearlessly discover it, expose it, and persuade it to promote the early maturity and establishment of a purely objective concept of Xinjiang history, and to awaken and win the scientific spirit that is its prerequisite, and to do our part in pioneering efforts.

In the classical historical materials of China, we must examine those irresponsible heroism, legendary spirit, and feudal commercial nationalistic factors, such as the tradition of the Western Regions concept, Ban Chaoism, and Zuo Zongtangism. Because we estimate that the existence of these concepts will not help to truly promote the sincere unity of the Chinese people, they must be discarded.

In the classical historical materials of Islamic countries, we must examine religious fanaticism and the megalomania and exclusiveness of narrow ethnic nationalism, such as Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, which have fallen behind in the entire world evolution. Because these ideas are not beneficial to truly promoting the freedom, happiness, and liberation of the people of Xinjiang, they can only lead to extreme disconnection and stubbornness.

In the historical materials of Western countries, we must be able to accurately distinguish some opinions that are popular based on scientific pseudoscience, as well as ignorant judgments formed by neglecting the value of other civilizations, such as the sense of superiority that the West is the mother of world civilization, and the rough conclusion that the foundation of Xinjiang civilization must also belong to Aryan civilization and Greek civilization. Because the influence of this kind of scientifically pseudoscientific speech is deeper than that of preaching without scientific training, and it is also harmful to the continued development of speculation and antiquities, it must be paid attention to.

In the historical materials of the Soviet Union, we must both absorb its newer scientific achievements and pay attention to its clever propaganda techniques. This is because the Soviet historical view not only has the characteristic of absolute "monism," but is also using its dogmatic spirit to dominate other thoughts. Although it has all-encompassing content, it does not have the tolerance to respect other civilizations. Before this new historical dynamic, not only will other valuable different concepts be eliminated, but even the good objective spirit will not be allowed to exist. Although we are extremely willing to accept all the valuable scientific contributions of the Soviet Union in thought, we can only use them as one of the mainstream of modern thought and cooperate with them, but we cannot take them as the whole of modern thought and be dominated by them, nor can we admit that the Soviet view is an objective view. This is the limit of our use of Soviet historical materials. At the same time, in essence, we have to admit that the subjectivity of the Soviet historical view is no different from the subjectivity of the classical historical materials of China and Islamic countries.

### Barter Policy with Japan

(Continued from page 1) According to the regulations, Japan is a defeated country, and its government and people are not allowed to trade freely with other countries during the occupation period. All Japanese yen should not have an international exchange rate, but its products are urgently needed by the victorious countries. Therefore, the controlling authorities decided to operate under a barter accounting method between the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers and the governments of various countries. It is stipulated that this Japanese barter policy is jointly handled by various countries. Since the governments of various countries are in a victorious position, they all want to take goods from Japan, and then gradually pay for them with goods. The faster the goods are obtained and the slower the repayment is, the more beneficial it is. Only the victorious countries can overdraw. Since our country is a neighbor and transportation is easier, the number of imports is also relatively large. For example, 6,190,518 mining timber have been shipped in, and 579,165 railway sleepers have been shipped in, as well as 8,283 boxes of explosives. The coal and electricity supply, which should have been the most panicked after the war, has not had any major problems so far, mostly based on the implementation of this barter. Therefore, the Executive Yuan's decision is of great benefit to economic recovery, because the more goods are obtained, the more beneficial it is to the recovery. At the same time, due to cargo transportation, the excess of imports over exports changes from time to time. According to the recent situation, there is a total debt of approximately several million U.S. dollars to the Allied Headquarters. The reasons are: 1. Our country has been taking goods quickly; 2. In the past year, the export of surplus goods has decreased. If the export is carried out according to the original quantity, not only can the excess of imports be avoided, but also the import volume of industrial equipment can be increased. Recently, the Resource Committee has been shipping iron sand from Hainan Island to Japan through the China Trust Bureau. In terms of barter, if the raw materials lacked by Japan are no longer supplemented, then the copper and iron products needed by the country, such as locomotives and rails, cannot be imported anymore. At the same time, with the export of this iron sand, the China Trust Bureau can negotiate with the Allied Headquarters to have at least half of the goods transported by our country's ships, which will be more beneficial to our country's shipping industry. As for the equipment supplied by the China Trust Bureau to the Resource Committee that has already been delivered, it is worth approximately 510,000 U.S. dollars. The equipment that has been ordered but not yet delivered is worth approximately 560,000 U.S. dollars, totaling 1,170,000 U.S. dollars. This barter will continue next year. The Salt Administration will also supply more surplus salt within the possible scope.

### Suzhou and Wuxi Rice Prices Rise

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 13th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government reported that after the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, commodity prices in the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line have risen sharply. It is actually caused by blind price increases by some illegal merchants. The provincial government has issued a circular to all counties, urging them to adopt effective methods to suppress the price increases. After receiving the order, the county government of this county assigned the Social Affairs Section to cooperate with the police station to be responsible for the implementation. Today, all industries and markets are densely packed with police officers and plainclothes police officers, monitoring transactions. However, the price of rice in the food market continues to rise. The opening price in the morning was 820,000, and there was no standard for the closing price, approximately around 920,000. The future of people's food is obviously quite serious.

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 13th] Because of water flooding, transportation difficulties, and withering of rice crops here, Liu Yuan is declining and is willing to lightly sell. Today, white rice is sold at 880,000, suddenly reaching a new peak, rising by more than 40,000. Baiyang rice is 870,000, and Baiyuan rice has reached the 900,000 mark. Wheat is opened at 890,000, exceeding the price of rice. Military ship flour is 337,000, edible oil is 1,920,000, rising by 100,000, and other daily necessities are soaring in unison.

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 13th] The negotiated price of cotton in Nantong County yesterday increased by 200,000 compared to the previous period.

### Song Ziwen Invites Experts to Discuss Stabilizing Prices, Guangzhou Rice Prices Fall, People's Hearts are Settled

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 13th] One thousand dollar gold certificates were issued and circulated here on the 12th. The two thousand and five thousand denominations have not yet been transported. In order to prevent the opportunity to raise prices and sell foreign currency, the customs has dispatched inspection teams to earnestly carry out their work. Chairman Song also invited economic experts to discuss effective countermeasures to stabilize prices, including ordering the county governments in rice-producing areas to persuade large households to release surplus grain, and strengthening anti-smuggling work in eastern rice-producing areas. In order to adapt to the actual situation in the city, the prices of major commodities such as flour, oil, sugar, beans, firewood, salt, cotton, and yarn are rigidly regulated, and all futures trading is absolutely prohibited. Following the implementation of the in-kind ration system for public school employees, the system of rationing grain according to the number of people will be promoted, and a subsidy policy will be adopted to set public prices and ration major daily necessities for people's livelihoods. In addition, the Guangdong Food Design Committee is now actively purchasing foreign rice to maintain the food supply for the people, in response to current needs. More than 1,000 large bags of Hubei grain have been transported to Guangzhou, and Hong Kong rice is also being shipped to Guangdong in a steady stream. Therefore, the price of rice has continued to fall in recent days. The price of 100 jin has fallen from more than 1.2 million to more than 800,000. As for the black market for Hong Kong dollars, it has continued to fall due to the tightening of credit, and people's hearts have been settled.

### Macao Government Orders Ban on Rice Exports to Help Us Curb Smuggling

[Our Guangzhou Office, 13th Dispatch] Chairman Wei Yuwen previously requested the Macao authorities to assist our country in curbing the smuggling of rice to Hong Kong by smugglers from Zhongshan.

At the same time, to assist our country in preventing smuggling activities, electric-powered vessels equipped with self-defense weapons are ordered to remove heavy weapons exceeding those required for self-defense. According to the Portuguese Consul in Guangzhou, McCallum, Chairman Zhu expressed that the required amount of food for Macao can be investigated monthly, and Zhongshan County will supply as much as possible. This cooperative spirit is truly encouraging.

### Soviet Foreign Minister Vehemently Criticizes Western Countries' Policy Towards Germany, Tensions Rise, Foreign Ministers' Conference Postponed to Tomorrow

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 13th Broadcast: Due to the fierce dispute on Friday evening, the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, originally scheduled to be held today, has been temporarily postponed to next Monday to ease the atmosphere. A member of the US delegation said that if the meeting continued today, it would cause a chaotic scene. Two days of rest can give the four foreign ministers a careful consideration of future actions. Authoritative sources said that the German reparations issue has fallen into an unresolvable stalemate. If the reparations issue is not resolved, other economic issues cannot be discussed. This weekend, Marshall will make a decision on whether to continue the Foreign Ministers' Conference, all depending on Molotov's attitude at the meeting next Monday. It is reported that Molotov is willing to keep the meeting going. A Soviet spokesperson said that Marshall's attitude before the meeting was crucial.

[Reuters, London, 12th] Today's Foreign Ministers' Conference turned into a phase of mutual accusations again. Molotov accused the Western allies of forcing Germany to accept aid without German consent, which is tantamount to acting on their behalf, with the intention of criticizing the Marshall Plan. Most of today's meeting was taken up by Molotov's long speech on the reparations issue. Afterwards, Bevin said: "The way we have been insulted will cause resentment throughout the British Commonwealth." Bidault also said that Molotov's statements were completely contrary to the facts. Marshall said that judging from the purpose of the meeting and the positions of the delegates in their governments, it gives the impression that such procedures will make it difficult to generate respect for the Soviet government. Molotov's statement on the reparations issue contained the following accusations: The three Western delegations' opposition to Soviet reparations is contrary to the attitudes of Yalta and Potsdam; The production in West Germany has fallen into a state of suffocation. The Western countries' suppression of German industry is intended to allow imports to flood into Germany; The export of timber and similar products from West Germany allows foreign bankers and entrepreneurs to profit greatly; Due to the influx of imports into the Western occupation zone, Germany is heavily in debt. It is heard that Germany owes the United States $600 million and the United Kingdom $700 million, which ultimately forces German industry to rely on foreign capital; The Western countries are using West Germany as a base for exerting political pressure on Germany both domestically and abroad, and as a strategic base for anti-democratic countries.

At the beginning of today's meeting, the Soviet Union's proposal to abolish the economic merger agreement of the British and American zones in Germany was first discussed. Molotov said that the three Western occupation zones already have plans for political and economic merger, and France also agreed to this matter. He also said that the division of Germany is becoming increasingly deep, tending towards the despair of establishing a unified Germany. Marshall immediately denied the existence of a merger plan for the three Western zones, and said that the economic merger of the British and American zones was a temporary measure pending the unification of the entire German economy, and that the British and American governments have repeatedly stated their willingness to expand these merger systems to other zones to achieve the unification of the German national economy. Marshall also stated that the merger of the British and American zones was a self-defense measure to prevent the Soviet Union from rushing to transfer the economic resources of Eastern Germany while the British and Americans were properly funding West Germany.

### British Foreign Secretary Declares Willingness to Promote International Understanding

[United Press, London, 13th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin also delivered a speech at the British-American Christian Friendship Association last night, echoing US Secretary of State Marshall. Bevin said, "Our friendship does not exclude others. We are wholeheartedly willing to be friendly with all of humanity. We British and Americans can understand each other, and we hope that the whole world can understand each other." French Foreign Minister Bidault was also present at the time, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was not seen in attendance.

When Molotov hosted Marshall, the Soviet ambassador refused to talk about political matters, limiting himself to social issues. However, Marshall will be able to change his style this time, and it is expected that he will state the US position to test the Soviet Union's final attitude. All delegates feel that the showdown period of this meeting has arrived. Some delegates pointed out that if Molotov does not change his position, it may take some time to sort out the issues before the meeting adjourns.

[Our Own Reporter] Lu Yongshi, a villager from Pudong, became engaged to Wang Azhang's daughter, A Wu, in the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928). At that time, both parties were underage. All betrothal gifts, including gold hairpins, gold rings, and silver dollars, were entrusted to the matchmaker. Later, when they grew up, they chose to marry in November of the 34th year (1945). Lu prepared a sedan chair, formal attire, phoenix coronet, candles, and a wedding feast for the appointed day. However, at this moment, he suddenly received a letter from a lawyer entrusted by Wang A Wu, canceling the marriage contract. Lu was deeply saddened by this sudden change and estimated that he had already spent over ten million yuan. He then filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting a judgment ordering the return of the gold items and compensation of 11,872,000 yuan, and requesting a declaratory judgment for provisional execution. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Yingqiao of the Seventh Civil Division held a hearing. Both parties engaged in a heated debate in court. Lu claimed that he was detained on criminal suspicion before the wedding and had requested the woman to postpone the wedding date, which was not approved. After being released, he went to pick up the bride as agreed a few days before the wedding. However, Wang refused to get into the sedan chair, resulting in an empty return. The next day, Wang announced the termination of the marriage contract in the newspaper, implying that she was in love with someone else. However, he had already spent a lot of money and requested a judgment ordering the return of the betrothal gifts. According to Wang's statement, Lu's accusations were inconsistent with the facts. Lu was released from prison in the 34th year (1945), and the wedding date was November 21 of the same year. Lu was released from prison only one day before the wedding date. How could he have made preparations in such a short time? She had originally intended to marry, but because the wedding date was mistaken, she announced the termination of the marriage contract in the newspaper. Furthermore, the marriage was arranged by the parents when both the man and woman were underage, and she could legally request the cancellation of the marriage contract. She requested the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. After the conclusion of the arguments by both parties, the court announced that the judgment would be delivered on the 16th of this month.

### Living Expenses for Families of Traitors: Stipulation of 10% to % of Total Assets

[Our Own Reporter] Regarding the punishment of traitors after their sentencing, the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors stipulate that all their assets, except for the necessary living expenses for their families, shall be confiscated. However, there is no clear provision in the law on the standard for determining the amount of necessary living expenses. Therefore, courts have encountered difficulties when executing judgments on traitor cases. The Shanghai judicial authorities have recently received instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stipulating that the standard for the necessary living expenses for the families of traitors shall be 10% to 20% of the total assets. Within this range, the court may consider the number of family members, their age, and their ability to work to make a ruling. In the future, both the confiscation of assets and the provision of living expenses will be based on this standard.

[Our Own Reporter] At 7:00 PM the night before last, the police station arrested a lone robber in front of the Great World. The robber, named Yan Zifei, was 25 years old and from Qiqihar. On the day of the arrest, at 12:00 PM, the robber impersonated an economic section staff member of the local authorities, using the pseudonym Song Chengwei. He went to the Fang Zijin Jewelry Store at No. 386 Henan Road and entered the store under the pretext of investigating the black market for gold and cash. He rushed directly to the second floor, pulled out a pistol, and attempted to extort four large bars of gold without success. He then ordered the manager of the store, Jin Chuxiang, to open the safe and stole the only remaining 2 million yuan. He then forced Jin to follow him out of the store. They walked along Second Mazhong Road, Third Mazhong Road, Guangdong Road, and Shandong Road, negotiating along the way. He instructed Jin to call the store and prepare the money. As a result, Jin promised to hand over six taels of gold, arranged to be delivered at 7:00 PM that night in front of the Great World.

Section Chief Chen Jinsheng, staff member Li Xiqing, Sun Liting, and Police Officer Hua Jinuo were dispatched by the police chief on time to set up an ambush.

### Wuxi's Cunning Bandit Chief: You Jugeng Captured

[Our Own Reporter, Wuxi, 12th] In the case of the kidnapping of Huang Genxiang, owner of the Xiexing Foundry under the Huiban Bridge in the north of Wuxi, it was learned from the confession of wanted criminal Su Xiaoquan and others apprehended by the Criminal Police Brigade that the mastermind behind the case was the notorious bandit chief You Jugeng. The county authorities stated that You had defected from the guerrilla forces to the enemy puppets during the occupation, committed many evils, and had long been wanted for treason. Now, he dared to collude with bandits and commit kidnapping, which was extremely illegal. Therefore, they strictly ordered their subordinates to intensify their efforts to track down and arrest him for investigation. After four months, You was finally captured in Shitang City on the night before yesterday. His accomplice Zhou Shenggen was also arrested on the spot, and a light machine gun and a revolver were seized. Sun Ruyuan and Sun Muji, the landlords who had harbored the bandits, were also taken into custody. You will be interrogated by the Wuxi Command due to his status as a traitor and former collaborator, while the other criminals have been handed over to the police bureau and transferred to the county government for investigation in accordance with the law.

Former Boatman and Puppet Darling

You Jugeng, a native of Liu Village in the northern part of the county, was originally a boatman before the Anti-Japanese War. When Wuxi fell in the winter of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), he first joined the Sixth Detachment of the Zhongjiu Army under the command of Hui Min and engaged in guerrilla warfare. Known for his bravery, You quickly rose to prominence because he was naturally violent and killed people like grass without blinking an eye. After the deaths of guerrilla leaders You Guozhen and others, You's position in the guerrilla forces in the north became even more important. At that time, an enemy vehicle passed through the north and was intercepted by our guerrillas, and several enemies were captured. The enemy puppets were alarmed but since then the enemy puppets have paid extra attention to the north, with large numbers of enemy troops going to harass the area. As a result, the general guerrilla personnel sought their own way out and transferred to the "New Fourth Army" or the "Peace Army". You also joined the enemy army organ and served as a secret agent. After several activities, he became the puppet chief of the Qianzhou District Police Branch.

Hiding Beauty in a Golden House: Wife and Concubine Both Died

Since taking office, You had unscrupulously plundered the area and had savings in his hands. After having enough food and warmth, he began to think about lasciviousness. You, who was in his prime, had a handsome appearance and liked to flirt with women. He frequented brothels and became acquainted with Chen Yuanyuan, a well-known Pingtan actress. They fell in love at first sight and were deeply devoted to each other. Soon, they rented a house and lived together. However, just as You was feeling triumphant, the enemy police suddenly received information that You was colluding with bandits. He was taken to the troop and tortured to force him to confess. As a result, the enemy police escorted him to the enemy military law office in Shanghai. You's wife, who was also naturally shrewish, witnessed her husband's life being in danger and secretly returned to her hometown, gathering her followers, kidnapping, extorting ransoms, and setting up checkpoints to commit evil deeds. She first had Su Weibin, the director of our underground county government, strangled to death, and then rekindled the flames by shooting Chen Yuanyuan. However, You's wife was soon killed by Su's cousin, resulting in a situation of "he who kills will also be killed."

Committing Evil: Unable to Escape the Grasp of the Law

In the spring of the 34th year (1945), You was released and returned home. His wife and concubine had both died. The mountains and rivers were still the same, but the people were no longer the same. He could not help but feel a sense of regret, so he often traveled between Wuxi and Shanghai. When the enemy troops surrendered, You regained his former prestige, with guards accompanying him in and out. Later, after the Third Front Army arrived in Wuxi, the situation changed. You knew that it would be difficult to gain a foothold in the city, so he retreated to the north and continued to collude with the bandits, regarding robbery as a regular occurrence. Later, because kidnapping was more profitable than robbery, he set his sights on extortion and invited his accomplices to come to the city and kidnap Huang Genxiang of the Xiexing Sand Factory, extorting 70 million yuan before he was redeemed. Later, after the Criminal Police Brigade solved the case, the details of the case became clear. Therefore, the local security authorities stated that You had long been wanted and still dared to mastermind kidnapping, which was a disregard for the law. Therefore, they strictly ordered their subordinates to arrest him and bring him to justice. Now, the arrest and investigation of You has finally been carried out, which greatly pleased the people.

### Female Corpse Discovered in Wuxi: Tied to a Giant Stone

[Our Own Reporter, Wuxi, 12th] An unidentified female corpse was discovered under the Fanqi Bridge in Tangtou City, north of the city, at 8:00 AM on the 11th of this month. The corpse was approximately 20 years old and was wearing a velvet vest with a printed silk cotton qipao on top, yellow shorts underneath, and was barefoot. The entire body was bound with gray leggings, and a large stone weighing approximately 40 to 50 jin was tied to the chest. The left and right calves were covered with scars, and the facial muscles were severely decomposed. Judging from the circumstances, the corpse had been immersed in the river for about half a month. The township chief Yuan Meilin reported the incident to the local prosecutor's office, requesting an autopsy. After receiving the report, Prosecutor Liu brought a forensic examiner to the countryside for an autopsy. It was determined that the deceased had been strangled to death and then the body had been abandoned in the river. Since there were no family members to claim the body, the government ordered the Tu Zheng (village head) to prepare a coffin for burial.

### Anhui Improves Agricultural Technology: Large-Scale Farms to Be Established

[Our Own Reporter, Huizhou, 10th] The farming techniques in the agricultural production areas of various counties in the northern and southern parts of the province are mostly old and have not been improved, resulting in a decline in the production of agricultural products and the economic poverty of rural areas. In particular, the frequent floods in the Jianghuai area in recent years have left vast areas of the northeast barren. The provincial government believes that the establishment of large-scale farms is urgently needed and is currently discussing the matter with relevant parties. Once the farm locations are determined, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be requested to send personnel to assist in the design in the short term, and tractors will be used for reclamation in the northeastern Anhui region. At the same time, the provincial relief branch will also establish two cooperative farms in northeastern Anhui. The Executive Yuan will allocate 49 tractors to this province through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for use by cooperative farms and mechanized farms to expand production in agricultural areas. Furthermore, the China Agricultural Bank has issued a letter to the Wuhu branch of the China Agricultural Bank, increasing the loan quota by 1.7 billion yuan for ordinary agricultural loans in this province, including 400 million yuan for production loans, 800 million yuan for extension loans, and 500 million yuan for small-scale water conservancy projects. The provincial government will first allocate the increased production and water conservancy loans to the counties and cities, and then send telegrams to the counties and cities to inform the community that they can directly contact the Wuhu branch for loans. The 800 million yuan for extension loans is still being planned and allocated by the provincial government.

### Jin Deming's Posthumous Affairs: Handled by Friends from His Lifetime

[Report from our Suzhou Bureau, 13th] A bizarre murder case occurred on the 11th at No. 23, Lin, inside the Suzhou Gate. The victims were Jin Deming, a lieutenant attached to the 5th Company of the 1st Battalion of the Xuxian County Regiment Management District, and his wife. The occupants of the house heard nothing when the incident occurred. After committing the crime, the murderer:

Locked the Door

and calmly fled. The deceased's two sons are also missing, making the case confusing and perplexing. Details are as follows: The deceased, Jin Deming, was from Jianyang County, Sichuan, 33 years old. His wife, Zou, was a remarried woman. The couple had a harmonious relationship and had two sons and one daughter. The eldest son is five years old, the second son is three years old, and the daughter was born in April of this year. During the War of Resistance, Jin served as a warrant officer of ammunition in the 1st Battalion of Mortars in the Wan District Garrison Headquarters. He was later promoted to lieutenant platoon leader. After the victory, he was assigned to the 28th Army Officer Corps. In February of this year, he began working in the Xuxian County Regiment Management District. He lived with six other families in a house in front of Baolin Temple. Jin had a batman named Yang Huimin who:

Followed Him Everywhere.

He also slept outside Jin's bedroom at night. Jin was known for his violent temper and often beat Yang. On the evening of the 10th, Jin went to a small restaurant after work to get drunk and watch a movie. He returned home to sleep around 9 p.m. The next day at noon, the other occupants saw that Jin's door was locked. Thinking he had gone out, they initially did not suspect anything. However, when the child cried incessantly, they began to suspect something was wrong. They asked through the door and heard a faint moan from inside. They realized something was amiss and quickly climbed a ladder to look through the window facing the street. They saw Jin and his wife lying in pools of blood. They ran to tell the Baojia chief, who reported it to the police station, the military police, and the regiment management district. They forced the door open and saw Jin's wife lying on the iron bed, with seven axe wounds on her neck, the bloodstains blurred, barely alive. Jin was lying face down on the floor in front of the bed, wearing shorts and barefoot, his head:

Chopped with Eight Axes.

Blood flowed out. He had already died. The bedding on the bed was stained with blood and in disarray, suggesting he had struggled desperately when attacked. The murder weapon, a wood-chopping axe, was hidden under a sheet. The batman, Yang Huimin, and Jin's two sons were missing. The baby daughter was safely lying in the quilt, crying. Only a handbag and a self-defense revolver were missing from the room. The wounded Zou was immediately sent to the Gongqi Hospital for emergency treatment.

All the aftermath of the deceased is now being handled by friends from his lifetime. His young daughter is also being temporarily taken care of by colleagues.

The Critical Situation Today

Jin's Wife Zou's

Condition is Improving. She is now able to speak intermittently. Colonel Du Xu, commander of the regiment management district, and Qian Shulin, captain of the police criminal investigation team, rushed to the hospital ward to inquire about the case after receiving the report, hoping to obtain clues about the murderer and the incident from the victim. However, Zou had seven axe wounds to the head, the front and back of her head, and suffered severe shock at the time, resulting in mental derangement and incoherent speech. Her answers were irrelevant to the questions asked, and nothing was gained. According to Dr. Zhang Lei, deputy director of the hospital, it may take three or four days for Zou to regain her senses.

### Difficulties in Handling Express Telegrams and Future Improvement Plans

— Ji Liang

It has been almost a year since the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau opened express telegram services between Beijing and Shanghai last December, followed by Wuxian, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Yinxian in January and February of this year. At the beginning of the service, citizens praised its convenience, as it was indeed able to achieve "speed," "accuracy," and "convenience," and was praised by all sectors of society. However, in recent times, the demand from users has been increasing daily, and the bureau is limited by the capacity of its machines and lines, which has resulted in frequent suspensions of service. The outside world, unaware of the real situation, seems dissatisfied, but once explained, it is not difficult to understand. Here, I would like to explain the difficulties in handling express telegrams for the reference of all sectors of society.

Shanghai is the only major commercial port in China, and the nation's financial and commercial information all looks to Shanghai for guidance. Most of this information is transmitted via express telegrams. According to statistics, in the early days of the service, the total number of express telegrams sent from Shanghai to various places was only about 300 per day. Subsequently, the number gradually increased, and now it exceeds 1,000 per day, with the most congested routes being those to Nanjing, Wuxi, Hangzhou, and Yinxian, especially Wuxi. The direct-circuit telephone lines from the bureau to the above-mentioned locations are sixteen lines to Shanghai-Beijing, eight lines to Shanghai-Hangzhou, seven lines to Shanghai-Wuxi, four lines to Shanghai-Zhenjiang, four lines to Shanghai-都, and three lines to Shanghai-Jiaxing. All of these lines need to be shared equally by the originating and receiving locations. In short, only half of the above numbers represent the telephone lines available for Shanghai to use. Each telephone line can only handle a maximum of six actual calls per hour. Taking Wuxi as an example, only eighteen to twenty calls can be handled per hour. Users call to send express telegrams, and they all concentrate their calls during office hours (from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), hoping to get through within that time. However, the bureau has to consider the connection time limit (ten minutes) and the telephone line capacity, so when there is excessive congestion, it has no choice but to temporarily suspend registration and only continue accepting new users after the registered users have cleared. This is one of the reasons why the service cannot run smoothly. Secondly, 98% of Shanghai's long-distance telephone users are users of the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, with a total of more than 60,000 numbers. According to regulations, each long-distance telephone line should be equipped with a pair of outgoing trunk lines (used by the long-distance exchange to connect to local city lines). Currently, the bureau has a total of seventy wired telephone lines to various parts of the country, three radio telephone lines (to Chongqing, Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, Beiping, Guangzhou, Taipei, Jinan, etc.), and two China-US international radio telephone lines. However, the existing number of outgoing trunk lines, including notice lines, is only sixty pairs, which is far from sufficient, resulting in more than twenty long-distance telephone lines being vacant due to the lack of trunk lines. This is the biggest reason for the congestion. Thirdly, during peak calling hours, the dial tone of city telephones is often very slow, wasting time and affecting the number of long-distance calls that can be connected.

In summary, in order to improve the current long-distance telephone service, the first step should be to increase the number of outgoing trunk lines. The bureau has repeatedly requested the company to increase them, but the company is currently unable to agree due to a shortage of machines and lines and difficulties in applying for foreign exchange. In order to protect the interests of the public, the bureau has established close communication with the company to jointly find ways to solve this difficult problem. Secondly, in order to increase the number of long-distance telephone lines, the bureau has made various preparations. In addition to completing a four-core cable along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line and erecting two pairs of new long-distance telephone poles along the Beijing-Shanghai highway, and installing a large number of carrier-wave telephone machines, it has also ordered dozens of the latest model long-distance console seats from the United States, in order to improve both the "quantity" and "quality" of the service simultaneously. Therefore, in the near future, Shanghai's long-distance telephone service will be able to serve society with a new image.

### Common Sense for Telephone Users

— Mu Zeng

Just imagine, what would happen in a city like Shanghai if all the telephones in the city suddenly stopped working? All political and commercial contacts would have to be resolved by running errands in person. Not to mention the serious inconvenience caused, the entire activity of the city could simply be paralyzed! In fact, telephone communication has become an indispensable part of urban prosperity. However, although everyone knows the importance of telephones, only a tiny fraction of the city's residents can make full and good use of them. Due to misuse or carelessness, telephone communication suffers unnecessary difficulties in terms of technology or management, which is a loss for both users and the authorities. The purpose of this article is to provide some simple knowledge about telephones (limited to local city telephones), and in our explanations, we will focus on users of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, commonly known as "〇2" telephones.

Shanghai Telephone Zones

Originally, the city's telephone traffic was divided between two organizations: the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, an affiliate of the Ministry of Transportation; and the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company. The former's jurisdiction covered Hongkou, Zhabei, Nanshi, Pudong, the city center, and other areas, while the latter's area covered the old two concessions and the areas beyond the concession boundaries. These two organizations are completely independent and unrelated. Due to the fundamentally different switching systems used by the two sides, intercommunication between the two sides requires cumbersome procedures. In addition, both sides use five-digit numbers, and often the user numbers are similar. For example, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Electric Bureau) has the user number 7〇731 in Nanshi, and the Shanghai Telephone Company (hereinafter referred to as the Company) also has the user number 7〇731, so the chance of misconnections is very high.

Now I will briefly describe the zoning situation of the two sides as follows:

Belonging to the Electric Bureau:

(1) Numbers starting with "5" - the city center area.

(2) Numbers starting with "6" - Hongkou, Zhabei, (north of Wujin Road) 傎茹, Wusong, and other areas. (Hongkou)

(3) Numbers starting with "7" - Nanshi, Pudong, Longhua, and other areas. (Nanshi)

Belonging to the Company:

(1) Numbers starting with "1" - West of Huangpu, south of Suzhou Creek, east of Henan Road, and north of 巾正东路. (Central)

(2) Numbers starting with "2" - the area beyond the Shanghai-West concessions　路区. (Jiangsu)

(3) Numbers starting with "3" - South of Suzhou Creek, east of Fanwangdu Road, north of Zhongzheng Middle Road, and west of Huanghe Road. (West Bureau)

(4) Numbers starting with "4" - North of Suzhou Creek, west of Shajing River, south of Wujin Road, and east of Xizang North Road. (North Bureau)

(5) Numbers starting with "5" - The old concession area east of Shajing River. (Huishan)

(6) Numbers starting with "6" - Some are in the "West" Bureau, and some are in the "Fenyang" Bureau.

(7) Numbers starting with "7" - South of Zhongzheng Middle Road, north of Xujiahui Road, east of Huashan Road, and west of Chongqing South Road. (Fenyang)

(8) Numbers starting with "8" - East of Chongqing South Road, north of Xujiahui Road, west of Minguo Road, and south of Zhongzheng East Road. (Yunnan)

(9) Numbers starting with "9" South of Suzhou Creek, west of Henan Road, north of Zhongzheng East Road, and east of Huanghe Road.

From the above, we can see that the city center users of the Electric Bureau may have the same numbers as the Huishan district users of the Company, and the Nanshi users of the Electric Bureau and the Fenyang district users of the Company have equal household numbers.

How to Make a Phone Call

Now we can talk about how to make a phone call. If an Electric Bureau user is calling another Electric Bureau user, or a Company user is calling another Company user, you only need to first hear the dial tone, and then dial the number. After that, wait. If you hear a ringing tone, it means the called user is free and will definitely answer. If you hear a busy tone, it means the called user is busy and you need to wait a while and dial again. Everyone probably knows the above. The problem now is how an Electric Bureau user calls a Company user, and vice versa. If an Electric Bureau user is calling a Company user, you need to listen to the dial tone as usual, and then dial "〇". Then listen for another slightly different dial tone (note, it must be "different". If it is the same, then dial "〇" again). After you hear it, then dial the number you need. After that, things are the same.

Conversely, if a Company user is calling an Electric Bureau user, you also listen to the dial tone as usual, and then dial "〇2". Wait. A female voice will answer you "〇2 What number are you calling?" Then you tell her what number you want. After that, things are also the same.

Therefore, before you make a phone call, you must first determine whether the party you are calling belongs to the Electric Bureau or the Company, and then you can start dialing. To determine which one it belongs to, please check the telephone directory. All those with "　" belong to the Electric Bureau, otherwise they belong to the Company.

Note: Sometimes, before you finish dialing the number, you already hear a busy tone. That means the switchboard is busy and cannot serve you. You can only wait a while and dial again. In short, as long as you hear a busy tone, it is useless to force the dialing (the machine may be damaged because of it!). You can only wait and dial again.

Telephone Obstacles

Anything that is a machine is bound to have the opportunity to experience obstacles. Telephones are no exception. However, when a telephone has an obstacle, the user should also know a little about how to deal with it. Otherwise, it is useless to simply say that the telephone is not working and scold the administration. Good maintenance depends on the cooperation of both the user and the bureau (company).

Obstacles can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is the telephone itself. The symptoms are: you can speak but cannot hear, or you can hear but cannot speak, or there is noise, the sound is too far away, etc. The second category of obstacle is the "cable", that is, the quick line from the user's phone to the machine room in the bureau (company). When a cable has an obstacle, when the user lifts the handset of the phone and listens quietly, they will definitely not be able to hear the dial tone, and when blowing air into the microphone, there will be no feeling in the handset. (Normally, when the line is normal, blowing air into the microphone can be heard in the handset.) The third category of obstacle lies in the machine in the bureau (company). If the user hears a special strange noise when listening quietly in the handset, the obstacle may belong to this category.

The above classification is just a rough method of identification. In fact, obstacles cannot be determined without detailed mechanical testing. However, when an obstacle occurs, users should never act clever and repair it themselves, because blind action will not only fail to repair the original obstacle, but will also add new obstacles!

When a user encounters an obstacle, the first step is to notify the bureau (company). If it is the Electric Bureau, then call "1〇1" (or report directly to the bureau). The operator on duty will immediately test it and then decide on the steps for repair. If it belongs to the Company, then call "〇1", and there will definitely be the same response. The repair date may be the same day, or it may take several days, depending on the severity of the obstacle. (Users have a kind of mentality, often wanting it to be repaired immediately after reporting it, but in fact, this is sometimes technically impossible.)

Telephone Maintenance

Finally, we need to talk about how to maintain a telephone. The responsibility for maintenance is of course the responsibility of the bureau (company) authorities, but users also have a little maintenance obligation. In other words, as long as users use it carefully and properly, it will not only save the bureau (company) many unnecessary repairs, but also improve the efficiency of telephone communication. Now, I will state the points that ordinary simple users should pay attention to when maintaining a telephone:

(A) Keep the telephone away from moisture. "Electricity" is most afraid of moisture, so it is best not to bring tea water and other things close to the telephone. Rainy days are also enough to cause the telephone to malfunction.

(B) Do not move the telephone too much (like dropping it, bumping it, etc.).

(C) When dialing, when the finger hole is turned back, do not force it back to its original position with your finger. Forcing it back will damage the dial and make the dialing inaccurate.

(D) Do not arbitrarily tap or press the "hook" (i.e., the thing that holds the handset).

(E) Do not disassemble the telephone and carry out unnecessary repairs.

### Introducing Social Telegrams

— Tao Yong

As the New Year approaches, using social telegrams as gifts is the most economical, fastest, and most generous.

"Social Telegrams" are not a new service. They were opened long before the War of Resistance, but military communications were frequent during the war. The telephone line capacity of various locations was insufficient, and they had to be suspended. After the victory, the telecommunications business returned to normal, and they were restored first in special bureaus and first-class bureaus starting on January 1, 1947. Because "Social Telegrams" have many advantages and conveniences, they have gradually attracted the attention of the Chinese people, especially in this year of economy. It is not only uneconomical to use physical objects to celebrate or mourn. Furthermore, if friends and relatives are far away, it is inconvenient to send gifts, and social telegrams can solve these difficulties. In addition to congratulatory telegrams, you can also attach gift certificates, which can be described as "economical and fast" and "beautiful and generous."

What kinds of things belong to "Social"

The scope of "Social Telegrams" is very wide. Generally speaking, there are congratulations, condolences, condolences, welcomes and farewells, thanks, etc. Congratulations are the most common type, including weddings, birthdays, births, ceremonies, commemorations, openings, and New Years.

Where to Send Them

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau's main business office (70 Fuzhou Road) and several demonstration business offices (25 Changzhi Road, 59 Zhongshan South Road) all accept this type of telegram.

Fees and Word Count

"Social Telegrams" are a type of discounted telegram, charged at half the price of ordinary telegrams (500 yuan per Chinese character, 1,000 yuan per English word), and the telecommunications bureau can translate the text without charging a translation fee. Each telegram is calculated starting with 20 Chinese characters or 10 English words. In other words, each telegram costs at least 10,000 yuan. If you choose to use ready-made phrases prepared by the bureau, they are only calculated as eight characters. As for the recipient's name and address and the sender's signature in the text, they are also calculated according to the number of characters. In this way, in addition to the eight-character idiom in the telegram, there are at least twelve characters that can be written, and the cost will not exceed too much.

Ready-made Phrases for You to Choose From

"Social Telegrams" are different from ordinary telegrams. The paper is glossy and larger, with "Social" (SLT) printed on it as a payment mark. The back is printed with ninety-four pre-written phrases of various natures for you to choose and use. The phrases are elegant and meet practical needs.

Beautiful, Generous, and Meaningful

The incoming telegram paper for "Social Telegrams" is specially made, divided into scarlet and blue. Except for condolence matters, which use blue, all the others use scarlet. The paper quality is real, the printing is exquisite, and the patterns are beautiful, enough to arouse the other party's goodwill. For example, if your friends and relatives get married in another city, send a "Social Telegram" within a few hours before the wedding ceremony. It can be delivered in no time. In addition to joy, when the other party receives that pink, more delicate and gorgeous congratulatory telegram paper than a gift certificate, they will feel extra joy. It is more interesting and meaningful than a couplet or a congratulatory banner. Besides, a couplet or a congratulatory banner sent to friends and relatives in remote areas will take several days to arrive! "Social Telegrams" can not only overcome the difficulty in time, but also solve the unnecessary waste of money, making the other party feel novel and satisfied. Therefore, it is an indispensable tool in modern social occasions and a new toy for people who value social interaction.

Attaching a Gift Certificate is Like Cash

There is also a special convenience in sending "Social Telegrams": if you want to give a gift to the other party, the gift money does not need to be remitted by the bank. Just attach the "Social Telegram" gift certificate. The gift certificates range from 10,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan. In addition to the telegram fee, regardless of the amount of the gift money, each telegram only charges a handling fee of 3,000 yuan. In this way, you can save a remittance fee or postage fee. When the receiving bureau receives a social telegram with a gift certificate attached, it will send the gift certificate or cash when delivering the telegram, without the need for the recipient to come and pick it up themselves. It is extremely convenient.

New Social Tricks

"Social Telegrams" can also be sent handwritten, and the price is 20% cheaper than ordinary handwritten telegrams. The other party will especially value it when they see the handwritten text. It can also be sent with gift certificates attached. This method has been implemented in Beijing and Shanghai since December of this year. There is also a special "congratulatory telegram" in "Social Telegrams" dedicated to congratulating the newly elected National Assembly representatives, and the price is also reduced by half.

Currently Open Locations

"Social Telegrams" are now open in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Tangshan, Kunming, Guilin, Xi'an, Guiyang, Changsha, Nanchang, Guling, Hengyang, Chongqing, Chengdu, Qujiang, Wanxian, Luxian, Yibin, Hechuan, Neijiang, Guangyuan, Shantou, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, Xiamen, Jiujiang, Ji'an, Yinxian, Yongjia, Xuzhou, Yixing, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Wuxian, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Taipei, and other 41 locations. Except for Guangzhou and Taipei, gift certificates can be attached to all the others.

### Special Express Telegram

— Jun Zhong

Among all kinds of telegrams, the fastest and most accurate is the special express telegram. Sending a special express telegram, compared to an urgent telegram of the same length, only costs an additional 8,000 yuan for the "special express delivery fee." However, in terms of speed and effectiveness, it is more cost-effective than an urgent telegram. It guarantees delivery to the recipient within one and a half hours. In any situation, the telecommunications bureau gives special treatment to special express telegrams. Senders and receivers have the right to priority delivery and sending, free proofreading, and a guarantee of absolute accuracy. After the sending bureau transmits the telegram, the receiving party must send back a "receipt confirmation," so "loss" is simply impossible.

The word "Special Express" should be clearly written on the application form for a special express telegram. Recently, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has been designing a special "Special Express Telegram Application Form" to make it more conspicuous.

The areas this type of telegram can reach are relatively limited. It requires a direct circuit between the sending and receiving bureaus and can only be opened when work is not congested. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau can reach the following locations: Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Taipei, Chongqing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Yinxian, and others!

### Telegraphic Sparks

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has added another 30,000 Chinese telegram registration numbers, from 540001 to 569999. Telegram registration numbers will now be sufficiently available, and no registration is needed.

Special express telegrams will continue to be available to Xi'an, Nanchang, Yongjia, and Wuhu from December 1st.

Telephone bills for all Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau "02" telephone users can be collected at all branch offices.

### Telecommunications Common Sense Talk

— Zhang Jiayu

Lecture 3: How to Choose Special Services (Continued)

Distribution: When a factory has a new product or a specially appointed distributor has a new product on the market, if telegrams can be used to introduce and recommend them to distributors in various regions, the recipients will definitely feel sincerely cared for and be happy to accept. At a time of fluctuating prices, if manufacturers or wholesalers can promptly inform distributors in various regions of new prices after each adjustment by telegram, it will surely make the distributors feel well-served and enhance their trust. Speaking of this, some may ask: The cost of sending telegrams is much higher than printing leaflets or placing newspaper advertisements. If dozens or hundreds of telegrams are sent at once, the cost would be quite considerable. How can we afford it! Well, please hold on! Here, I am going to introduce you to the most economical and practical method of sending multiple telegrams with identical wording, which is to use the special distribution service. If you can grasp the knack of using the special distribution service, it is equivalent to holding the key to developing business and increasing sales power.

Here, let's take a simple example to illustrate the use of the special distribution service: Suppose there is a large-sized soap factory in Shanghai that has just released a new "Telephone" brand soap. When it first enters the market, it can first find out and compile a list of the names and addresses of the distributors in various regions who usually order the most goods from the factory, and then send a telegram using the special distribution service to each region, listing the names and addresses of each distributor located in the same place (if the recipient has a telegram registration number at the local telecommunications bureau, the recipient's name and address can also be replaced with the telegram registration number), and write "Distribute (Number of Copies)" or TM... (Number of Copies) at the beginning of the telegram, for example: TM3 Hankou = Zhongshan Road (15) Huazhong Company = Zhongzheng Road (24) Hankou Store = Jianghan Road (181) Dazhonghang = (Text and sender's signature). Or: TM3 0022 = 3352 = 1129C Hankou = (Text and sender's signature) = Assume that the above three sets of codes are the telegram registration numbers of Huazhong Company, Hankou Store, and Dazhonghang.

After receiving this telegram, the Hankou Telecommunications Bureau immediately copies it into three copies and delivers them separately to Huazhong Company, Hankou Store, and Dazhonghang, and each copy only copies the recipient's name and address in one place, that is, the copy sent to Huazhong Company only writes Huazhong Company in the recipient's name and address, and does not include the names and addresses of Hankou Store and Dazhonghang, and so on for the copies sent to Hankou Store and Dazhonghang. This can allow the sender to maintain commercial confidentiality. If the sender, due to special needs, requests the Hankou Telecommunications Bureau to completely record the names and addresses of all the recipients listed in each distributed copy of the telegram, that is, the sender wants each recipient to be able to see which recipients the telegram is distributed to, just add "Complete Record" or CTA after the distribution identifier, and the telecommunications bureau can do so.

On the other hand, if you are preparing to send a very time-sensitive urgent telegram to an important person who lives in Chongqing and holds several positions, assuming that the recipient's current positions are the director of Tianxing Chemical Factory, the general manager of Xinda Department Store, and the president of the local Chamber of Commerce, he has to take turns going to the above three places every day. Sometimes he has to return to his own residence, and the distance between the factory, company, chamber of commerce, and residence is very far. If you send the telegram to the factory and the telegram arrives when he is working at the department store, or if you send the telegram to the chamber of commerce and the recipient has just returned to his residence, a slight miscalculation will cause a delay. In this case, you can also choose the special distribution service, and completely list the same recipient's multiple addresses in the same place (if there is a telegram registration number, the registration number can be used to replace the name and address), and add "Distribute (Number of Copies)" or TM... (Number of Copies) at the beginning of the telegram, for example:

TM4 Chongqing = Wang Tianyi, Hualongqiao Tianxing Chemical Factory = Wang Tianyi, Xinda Company, Zhongshan 1st Road (58) = Wang Tianyi, Municipal Chamber of Commerce = Wang Tianyi, Liangfuzhi Road (38) = (Text and signature)

After receiving this telegram, the Chongqing Telecommunications Bureau immediately copies it into four copies and sends them to the four addresses listed above. In this way, when the telegram arrives, the recipient can receive the telegram immediately no matter where he is.

Telegrams using the special distribution service are charged as one telegram regardless of how many copies are distributed. The number of words in the names and addresses of each recipient listed in the telegram are all counted and charged according to the actual number of words, and an additional distribution fee is charged. The current distribution fee is 2,500 yuan for each copy of less than 50 words (equivalent to the telegram fee of two and a half words for ordinary Chinese language telegrams), and an additional 2,500 yuan is charged for each additional one to fifty words. This low cost is even less than the cost of buying an envelope and stationery plus postage for a regular letter! (To be continued)

### Ethnic Border Disputes: Local Chieftain Demands Self-Management of National Muli Elementary School

[Our newspaper, Xichang Air Dispatch] Muli, located in southern Xikang Province, has always been known for its mystery. Not long ago, a conflict arose between the National Muli Elementary School and the local chieftain over enrollment issues. The Xichang Garrison Command sent personnel to Muli to investigate and handle the matter together with the school principal and the chieftain's representative. They have now returned to Xichang. According to the investigators, "Muli" is not as mysterious as people generally imagine. It is best for outsiders to have an acquaintance to introduce them when doing business. Otherwise, as long as they do not violate the rules of "no smoking," "no drinking," "no gambling," and "no stealing," they can still travel freely. Muli has a total of 8,000 households and a population of over 40,000, with Han Chinese accounting for about one-third, and the rest being Xifan, Miao, Yao, Tibetan, Tuban, and Luo. However, most of them can speak fluent Chinese. Muli has three major scripture halls, where Chieftain Xiang Songdian Chunpin rotates, living in each scripture hall for only one year. The scripture hall is the place where all orders are issued, like a government, and the chieftain has supreme authority, and the security situation is good. The chieftain employs a Han Chinese secretary to handle foreign documents and letters, and the documents still use the feudal title "Muli Pacification Commissioner." According to the investigation, the chieftain requested them to report to the government: The Muli Elementary School should be handed over to the chieftain for self-management. The current principal should be replaced.

### Tonight's Basketball Showdown: Transportation Automotive vs. Dagong at 7:00 PM at the City Gymnasium; No Tickets Available in the Afternoon to Avoid Crowds

[Our newspaper] The Transportation Automotive 16th Regiment Basketball Team is touring Shanghai, winning all three games, defeating the Renyu Shantou Team Qingbai.

To avoid overcrowding, tickets will be sold at the gymnasium entrance from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 30,000 for the upper level and 50,000 for the lower level.

The visiting team has had smooth sailing, and under the leadership of veteran Wang Shixuan and Captain Jia Zhijun, their strength is impressive and worthy of appreciation. The Dagong Team is newly formed, gathering the elite of Qunsheng and Zhenglun, and has a momentum of catching up.

### Qingbai Defeated: Transportation Automotive Unleashes Lightning Tactics; 64 to 44

[Our newspaper] In its third game last night, the Transportation Automotive 16th Regiment Basketball Team met the new force Qingbai, a veteran group. The gymnasium was packed with 3,000 spectators, making it watertight. It was expected to be a very interesting game. The former had the natural physical strength, while the latter relied on human experience and technology. The facts were contrary to expectations, and it was not exciting at all. Qingbai was defeated by Transportation Automotive under irresistible circumstances. Transportation Automotive took the lead with 30 to 20 in the first half, and the final result was 64 to 44, a difference of 20 points. The most significant contrast between the two teams was that Qingbai's shooting was unskilled, while everyone in Transportation Automotive could shoot. Qingbai's cooperation was not pure, and when defending, they used zone defense, with many loopholes. Except for Cai Yanxiong, Zhuo Guorong, and Zhang Shaoqing, the rest had lost their former skills. In the second half, Transportation Automotive saw that victory was in their grasp and was psychologically calm, further increasing the accuracy of their shooting. Transportation Automotive relied on its physical advantage, and its fast lightning tactics were very exciting. Yesterday, Transportation Automotive used a completely native team, and the battle was better than in the past.

### National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee: Members and Advisors Selected; Management Implementation Rules Also Drafted

[Our newspaper] The Management Implementation Rules of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Committee have been drafted by Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, together with relevant parties. Within a day or two, Yuan will personally take them to the central authorities for discussion and approval, so that the establishment of the committee can be deployed.

The candidates for members and advisors of the Control Committee were also received by the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday. The members are Yuan Liang, Liu Siying, Liu Gongyun, Gu Minquan, Hu Jingliang, Wang Lansheng, and Liu Wenteng, with Yuan Liang concurrently serving as the chairman and Liu Siying concurrently serving as the vice chairman. The advisors are Dong Yinzhang, Li Shengbo, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Rong Erren, Tang Xinghai, and Seventeen others.

After the establishment of the Control Committee, it will inevitably need to recruit a large number of control and executive personnel. However, it is difficult to recruit them at once, so there is a strong intention to borrow existing personnel from various branches of the Textile Construction Company across the country, adopting a proxy operation method. It is said that the Textile Construction authorities believe that control and business are different, and those who are good at business may not be good at executing control policies, so they have expressed hesitation to accept the proxy operation.

### Yarn Prices See Another Rise; Fabric Buying is Very Active

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, yarn prices rose again. The Textile Adjustment Committee specially sold yarn at the cotton yarn market on an ad-hoc basis. As a result, a total of 157 households were approved to purchase, and a total of 112 lots of yarn were sold, comprising 1354 lots of 20-count yarn. The listed prices were also slightly higher than before.

20-count Jincheng yarn was 31.2 million yuan. 20-count Five Sons, Sailboat, Andromeda, Golden Rooster, and New Sanduo were 30.7 million yuan. 20-count Red Bee, Prosperity, and Gold Ingot were 30.3 million yuan. 6-count was 15.4 million yuan, 32-count was 40 million yuan, 40-count was 42.8 million yuan, and 42-count double-ply was 49 million yuan.

Another report: Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw weaving factories absorbing at low prices, and out-of-town merchants also made purchases, pushing prices up frequently. The best price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn reached 50 million yuan. At 11:30 AM, Fangjian Textiles relisted, accepting applications from fellow businesses, with 20-count yarn being the majority. Allocation involved as many as 14 types, and the market turned soft and weak. Many were floating high, selling to realize profits, and prices hardened slightly near the close. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn soared to 49.2 million yuan, a sharp increase of 2 million yuan compared to the previous day. The price increases for various grades of 40-count yarn were even more intense, ranging from 1.56 million to 3 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn all rose by 1.1 million to 1.45 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton fabric market saw broad and dispersed trading at the opening in the morning, with stable prices. Subsequently, due to significant absorption by shop owners and purchases by out-of-town merchants, dyeing factories showed considerable interest in low-end fine cloth. Powerful players quickly made purchases, strengthening the buying momentum, and the market took off. Towards the end, various grades of fine cloth, such as 12-pound Dragon Head, all continued to rise by 20,000 to 50,000 yuan. Dragon Head fine cloth, to be delivered on Monday, was traded at a high of 1.37 million yuan. Other bleached coarse cloth, colored cloth, serge, and straight tribute cloth also showed strong performance in the market.

### Rumors of Abolishing Official Exchange Rates are Purely False

Adjusting Market Exchange Rates is Also Impossible

The National Economic Council recently approved that foreign exchange for essential imported goods such as rice, wheat, flour, cotton, coal, and fertilizer will be settled at posted market prices. It is expected to be implemented soon after approval by the State Council. However, yesterday, rumors suddenly spread here that the authorities would abolish official exchange rates and thoroughly adjust market exchange rates, causing considerable agitation.

According to a committee member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund, the above rumors are completely inaccurate. The import situation of the aforementioned materials is special. For example, cotton includes relief cotton from the Cotton Control Administration, loan cotton signed between the National Bank and Citibank, and cotton swapped with India for yarn, all of which are controlled by the government and do not require the consumption of official exchange rates.

Moreover, since the establishment of the council, no one has applied to purchase the above-mentioned import foreign exchange. The so-called abolition of official exchange rates is purely groundless. The thorough adjustment of market exchange rates is also factually impossible and will definitely not happen, he said.

### Money Market Remains Tight

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the money market remained tight, with private lending rates at 2.4%. The four banks and two bureaus had a net deficit of 95.1 billion yuan. The Central Bank had a deficit of 216.1 billion yuan due to the allocation of a large amount of tax revenue from the three banks, one bureau, and one treasury. Large clearing outflowed 45.9 billion yuan, foreign firms inflowed 54.7 billion yuan, small clearing outflowed 103.9 billion yuan, and Chinese firms outflowed 80.4 billion yuan.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Rise in Unison; Oil Market Rises Across the Board

Sudden Ups and Downs in the Process; Chinese Stocks Fluctuated

The situation of Chinese stocks yesterday was chaotic. With rumors of the opening of foreign exchange, buyers and sellers held their own views. Outside speculative funds were being absorbed, but powerful groups were actively selling off-market and even taking short positions. The process experienced sudden ups and downs. Except for China Porcelain Enamel delivery shares, which suddenly closed at the limit-up, the rest experienced mixed ups and downs.

The morning opening was weak due to reports of the US President having a 300 million yuan aid plan for China. Yong Yarn opened at 443 yuan and 456 yuan. Immediately after opening, there were rumors of favorable buying, which immediately pushed prices up to 457 yuan for spot and 472 yuan for delivery. Subsequently, with many closing positions, prices fell again to 440 yuan and 450 yuan. Off-market interest rates remained unchanged at 2.55% and 3%. When prices reached 450 yuan and 460 yuan, a certain group sold off-market, and there were rumors of short selling, causing prices to fall to 437 yuan and 446 yuan. Later, they rebounded by more than ten yuan, but soon were forced down again. The situation was chaotic, with all parties fighting with all their strength. The noon close was 442 yuan and 454 yuan. China Porcelain Enamel delivery shares closed at the limit-up, and Commercial Press new shares closed at a high price, rising higher than before the capital increase. As a result, compared to the previous close, China Porcelain Enamel and French shares each rose by about 10%, New Asia National Products rose by 5%, and Zhabei, China Textile, Rongfeng, Qinxing Underwear, and Xinhua rose slightly. China Cement, Jinglun, Datong, and Zhongxing remained flat. Yong Yarn, Yanhe, Huaxin, Tongyi, Meiya, China Silk, Matches, Xinguang, Jingfu, Yonggong, and Anhui declined. China Porcelain Enamel delivery shares closed at the limit-up, Qinxing rose slightly, and Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Meiya, Xinguang, and Jingfu all experienced slight declines. Off-market old shares remained strong, with Hanyeping alone rising by 10%.

Government bonds rose yesterday. Consolidated C bonds opened at 26,500 yuan, rising from 26,300 yuan to 28,300 yuan before leveling off slightly. Turnover was maintained at 5 million. As a result, compared to the previous close, A and B bonds rose by 1,000 yuan, C bonds rose by 1,300 yuan, D bonds rose by 800 yuan, and E bonds rose by 2,100 yuan.

Yesterday, foreign stocks generally hovered at high levels, with a narrow trading range. Hong Kong Shanghai Electric remained around 3.5 yuan, lacking special changes. Jardine Yarn opened at 415,000 yuan, rising from 409,000 yuan to 417,000 yuan before leveling off slightly. Large accounts were buying, while retail investors were selling. As a result, compared to the previous close, Union Trading, De Fengxiang, China Textiles, Telephone, and Tramways were flat, Jardine Brewery rose by 5%, and the remaining stocks rose slightly.

Relief Cotton Allocation by the Relief Administration

The Relief Administration announced: Within the week of the 6th, this office, in accordance with the yarn-for-cotton method agreed with the yarn factories, allocated a total of 8.390 tons of cotton to yarn factories such as China Textile Company, Datong Tongyi, Litai, De Feng, and Jia Feng, including 7.031 tons to China Textile Company and 1.359 tons to the other five yarn factories. The exchanged yarn will be sold by this office to stabilize yarn prices, and the proceeds will be used for long-term relief projects. This week, a total of 10.989 tons of materials were distributed in Shanghai and transported to other locations, of which cotton accounted for 72% of the total allocation.

Scarce Woolen Fabric Transactions

Yesterday, Saturday, woolen fabric transactions were not numerous. Large wholesale customers rarely came and went, and retail business in stores also became quiet. Although there were various favorable buying news for standard prices, due to sluggish actual sales and tight money supply, they could only maintain the status quo. Plain, thick woolen overcoat fabrics, melton, etc., showed signs of stability and slight decline as actual sales had passed the halfway point.

Textile Construction Company Sells Fabric

In addition, the China Textile Construction Company also sold fabric as usual yesterday, selling a total of 22,180 bolts of fabric and 440 quilts. A total of 550 applications were received, of which 29 applications were from manufacturers, purchasing 1,480 bolts of fabric. The rest were purchased by various fabric shops, it is said.

Spot Cotton Sluggish

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw firming trend, but due to tight money supply and inability of buyers to turn over capital, most transactions were shelved. Transactions were not numerous, and prices did not fluctuate much. The total daily turnover was 670 bales.

Soaps Soar

Yesterday's soap market saw prices soaring due to expensive raw materials. Merchants rarely sold together. The supply of spot goods on the market was insufficient. There was no trading in the market, but off-market prices were extremely chaotic. A box of 120 bars of Tongan soap was being offered at 1.15 million yuan, and someone finally sold it for 1.3 million yuan. Arrow Knife soap was 1.1 million yuan, Xiang Mao was 800,000 yuan, and other soaps such as Guanghua and Henry also rose by about 100,000 yuan.

Another report: In the afternoon, it was heard that Dacheng Company had opened a fixed-price purchase, priced at 970,000 yuan, and the market then saw prices falling. Fixed-price was 1.08 million yuan, and Xiang Mao was 770,000-800,000 yuan.

### Since the Issuance of Large Denomination Notes, Export Commodity Prices Have Remained Stable; Export Situation Has Not Yet Improved

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the issuance of the 1,000-yuan Customs Gold Unit notes, the prices of China's export commodities have not risen sharply. The prices of these commodities have always been based on the Central Bank's posted foreign exchange rate, and since the latter has not changed, prices have been able to remain stable temporarily.

Regarding the current export situation, Zhang Yaozhang, secretary-general of the local Import and Export Association, told reporters: Due to the political situation and the inflation situation, there has been no improvement in exports. The exchange rate adjustment provided some assistance at the time, but it is not a fundamental solution.

There are high domestic expectations for cotton cloth exports, but recently, Japan and India have established a barter agreement. The rupee price of Japanese cotton cloth is lower than that of domestically produced cotton cloth. For example, the Japanese Dragon Head fine cloth is only equivalent to 39 rupees, while the domestic cloth is above 40 rupees, which will inevitably cause difficulties for our cotton cloth export plan.

Seafood Holds Firm

Recently, merchants in the seafood industry stated that the digestion of various goods this month has been exceptionally smooth. There has been a lot of trading in the market, and the market has been soaring. Yesterday, shark fins soared to 100 million Customs Gold Units per dan, followed by squid, which also rose by 14-15 million yuan, dried scallops by 54-55 million yuan, sea cucumber top bald by 25-26 million yuan, and flower vase sea cucumber by 14 million yuan. Other Wen Kaiyang, Golden Hook Tail, Thick Mushrooms, and Fragrant Mushrooms also showed consistently strong performance.

Another report: Among North-South goods, walnuts, red and black dates, longan, vermicelli, and dried bamboo shoots had the best sales. Xiang Lian lotus seeds were even more actively sold, with prices reaching 3.6 million yuan, Longkou vermicelli at 6.5 million yuan, and the prices of other goods also followed suit, rising.

### Bank Bureau Cotton Mortgage - Four-Agency Jointly Request Chairman's Approval

This time, the National Bank Bureau was ordered to stop various loans, which has had a significant effect on stabilizing commodity prices and stabilizing the market. According to a responsible person from the Central Bank, the direct effects of this stoppage are twofold: 1. Reducing new buyers; 2. Increasing sellers, so prices can be balanced.

Furthermore, it is understood that this time, the stoppage of loans by the Bank Bureau also includes mortgages on cotton and flour. Whether to restore them will be jointly requested by the Four-Agency Headquarters for the Chairman's approval. The Bank Bureau has carefully considered and is working on mortgage on export commodities so that export commodities can be exported steadily in exchange for foreign exchange.

### A Glimpse of the Fishing Industry

In the vast ocean shrouded in mist, in China's fishing grounds spanning over 8,600 kilometers, on one side are wooden boats with sails dotted here and there, waiting for fish with nets, and on the other side are fishing vessels riding the waves, manipulating the lives of aquatic creatures. The former is the hard work of private fishing companies, and the latter is the new-style equipment of the Relief Administration's Fisheries Management Office. Under this stark contrast, private fisheries have finally issued a desperate cry. The disparity in production processes has caused today's conflict between the two.

Private fisheries are demanding to be allocated fishing vessels to reduce unloading volumes; however, the Fisheries Management Office believes that they do not yet possess the technology to operate new-style fishing vessels, and reduced cargo volumes are enough to threaten the people's food supply. Private fisheries also believe that if mass production causes fish prices to fall to the point where they almost become the staple food of the citizens, their fate will be unimaginable; however, the Fisheries Management Office disagrees with this statement from the perspective of focusing on citizen nutrition.

The dispute will eventually be resolved properly. Here, we first introduce several realistic scenes of the fishing industry under contrasting production methods to the readers!

### Western Bedbugs

— Ze Shi

"The West also has bedbugs," which means that even though our Republic of China is lacking in this aspect and not good in that aspect, Western countries are not as flawless as pure jade. Just as China has its inherent bedbugs, how can the West not have them? This is quite right. For example, China had one revolution and two revolutions, and how could Western countries not have them, and even had them earlier than us, and got rid of more lives than us. We have civil wars that are criticized by the world. Is the American Civil War an external war? We occasionally have one or two officials who are slightly corrupt in their spare time, and American journalists point their fingers at our foreheads and criticize us loudly. But as the Bible says: "Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye?" It is not wrong for us to say that there is a log in the eye of the United States. Just take a look at history, and you will know the corruption and exploitation of officials during the American Civil War, which is like the log and the speck mentioned by Jesus compared to us.

Therefore, the fact that the West also has bedbugs and scoundrels is an undeniable historical fact. The question is why, although the West has bedbugs, the sheets are not as blood-stained as ours. The reason for this is that, first, Western bedbugs are bedbugs, and people are people. The two are not the same. Therefore, the second reason is that people catch bedbugs when they are bitten by them or see them, catching more and more and reducing them, until they are almost non-existent.

But it seems that China is not like this. First of all, people and bedbugs seem to be indistinguishable. In other words, people are bugs, and bugs are people. All animals that get into bed, those who were originally bedbugs are still bedbugs. Even those who were not originally bedbugs have a tendency to become bedbugs. Therefore, despite pointing fingers and scolding bedbugs under the bed, they are unwilling to catch them. After getting into bed, they are even more naturally assimilated by the bedbugs. As a result, there are more and more bedbugs, and over time, the whole room is full, not just the bed.

Therefore, we don't have to and shouldn't scold the bedbugs, because we ourselves are candidate bedbugs.

### The American Soldier's Enthusiasm for Becoming a Monk

— Liang An

The United States today is a place with the most developed material civilization and the most abundant enjoyment of life; however, a large number of Americans abandon the prosperity of the world every year and go to quiet monasteries to live a simple and hard religious life. Among the Catholic orders, the "Trappist" is the most austere and disciplined. In recent years, however, there has been a particularly large number of people going to American "Trappist" monasteries. The Our Lady of the Prairies Monastery in Rhode Island, USA, recently admitted 35 monks, 25 of whom are American soldiers on expedition. In the other four "Trappist" monasteries in the United States, there are also many people applying for admission. The number of soldiers on expedition is also very high. War shakes people's humanity, and soldiers on expedition on the front lines are more sensitive to religion, so it is understandable that they go to monasteries to seek peace after returning from the expedition. According to the abbot of the Our Lady of the Prairies Monastery, the story of one of the expeditionary soldiers joining their monastery is as follows: "When I was on the front line, we learned night patrols and terror, and we also learned to pray. It was at this time that I decided to accept the "Cistercian" life; I lay on my side in a shallow "foxhole," and when bullets screamed over our heads and exploded, I heard a child constantly chanting "God, God!" ... I felt that my faith was not strong enough, and my faith and love were not enough. So I prayed to the Virgin Mary, asking her to protect me, and promising her to join the "Cistercian" Society to learn charity. She protected me, and I also joined the "Cistercian" Society."

### The Creator of Chaos

A lawyer, a doctor, an architect, and a communist - four people argued about which of the four careers was the oldest and had the longest history.

The lawyer said, "Of course it's us lawyers. If there is no law to govern everything in this world, how could mankind have gotten along until today?"

The doctor sneered and said, "Don't forget that if there were no obstetricians, Adam and Eve's descendants would not have been born."

The architect leisurely took a puff of his cigarette, pushed up his glasses and said, "You're talking nonsense. The universe was initially just a chaos, and gradually, making chaos into an orderly structure of various buildings is the merit of the architect!"

The communist had been drinking and remained silent at first. When he heard this, he laughed loudly. He shouted, "That's right, the universe was initially just a chaos! But who created this chaos?" (Wind)

It turns out that the so-called "Trappist" is originally named after the "La Trappe Abbey" built by the "Cistercian" order in Normandy, France. In the 17th century, this monastery made some changes to the rules they followed, advocating strict adherence to the rules; therefore, they were called the strict observance sect of the Cistercian order, which in English is called (Cistercians of the Strict Observance). Therefore, it is simply called the "Trappist" or "Trappist" sect. According to their rules, they have to get up at 2:00 AM every day, and even earlier on Sundays and other major holidays. They can only sleep for seven hours every day, spend about seven hours on spiritual practice and prayer, one hour for meals, four hours for reading and personal prayer, and five hours for labor. Except for illness and recuperation, they do not eat meat, eat fish, or even eat eggs; therefore, they are famous for making cheese. Except for talking with the abbot, or being designated by the abbot to direct work, they are not allowed to talk to each other. Therefore, they should be the people who understand silence the most.

In China, there is also a "Trappist" monastery, which is the "God Hall Monastery" in Yangjiaping, Huailai County, Chahar Province. According to statistics in 1940, there were 11 Chinese monks and 13 foreign monks there. In the barren north of the pass, they are living a silent religious life.

### The Greatness of the World

In the British Parliament's gazette, ordinary members are called "Honorable Members", members who have served in the military are called "Honorable and Brave Members", and members who have served in the military and also practiced law are called "Honorable, Brave, and Learned Members".

Recently, a man named Fagus wore an oxygen mask and dived from Sète, France into the Mediterranean seabed to a depth of 393 feet below sea level (pressure of 175 pounds per square inch), setting a new record. The old record was 295 feet (pressure of 131 pounds per square inch). However, Fagus eventually died a few hours after surfacing due to physical exhaustion.

After the US Congress passed the Declaration of Independence in 1776, the draft of the declaration was taken home by Jefferson, the original drafter, and over time, everyone forgot about it. It was not until forty-seven years later, when they wanted to investigate who drafted this draft, that this historically precious document was found in his home. (Le)

### Talking About Glass Stockings

— Ping

Having read the Shanghai local news section of the 12th's "Shen Bao," there's a news item titled "Mayor Appeals to Women: Why Wear Glass Stockings?". The main body of the piece concerns the "Inaugural Meeting of the Shanghai Citizens' Service for Promoting Domestic Goods Association," and the above two sentences are from Mayor Wu's address at the meeting.

In today's strong emphasis on promoting the importance of domestic goods, it is extremely appropriate. And to start by advocating the use of domestic goods in clothing is indeed a practical approach, which we naturally support wholeheartedly.

Because we uphold this principle, we demand that it be implemented in a proper and serious manner, in other words, that it be implemented effectively, and not be allowed to be done perfunctorily.

Mayor Wu's saying to ladies, "Why wear glass stockings?", of course, the intention is as good as it can be, but how much effect this kind of persuasion can produce is really hard to say. In my view, throughout history, both in China and abroad, the effectiveness of any great statesman making pronouncements on the fashions of ladies has probably always been quite limited. In the past, women were forbidden to perm their hair, but today even my family's maid perms her hair; Beiping also forbade wearing short-sleeved cheongsams, but as spring and summer arrived, the popularity of short-sleeved cheongsams remained unchanged; Mayor Wu is a graduate of Tsinghua University. Sixteen or seventeen years ago, Tsinghua forbade female students from wearing Western trousers. More senior students "dragged corpses" ("Toss" - a way senior students urged new students) and today the number of female students in Tsinghua University wearing Western trousers is definitely not small!

Indeed, from our men's point of view, ladies, "Why" do you have to wear glass stockings? However, on further reflection, there are countless "Why" questions: Why put on cold cream only to wipe it off hurriedly? Why apply powder - and apply different powders in the morning and evening? Why use lipstick - and vary the shade of lipstick according to whether it matches the color of the clothes? Why buy several different styles of handbags every year? Why—ah, why wear glass stockings, and why wear stockings at all?

Is it said to be difficult to change ingrained habits? In my opinion, the ladies' fondness for dressing up has probably evolved from "accumulated habits" to become "natural instincts," as biologists call "acquired characteristics." Therefore, telling them not to wear glass stockings, frankly, is something that will fail in eight or nine cases out of ten. I'm afraid Mayor Wu himself understands this very well. So, what is the way to promote domestic goods—I say: Instead of telling the ladies not to wear glass stockings, it would be better for domestic manufacturers to quickly find ways to imitate and produce them!

### A Record of the Resumption of Jiuda

—

In North China, there are three very famous industrial enterprises run by Chinese themselves: Qixin Cement Company (Hebei), Zhangyu Winery (Shandong), and Jiuda Refined Salt Company (Hebei). Jiuda is beneficial to the people's diet, especially in terms of hygiene, and its achievements are most obvious. During the "July 7th" Incident, the Japanese invaders devastated and plundered, causing enormous damage. After the restoration, cadres who had returned from the interior, along with local old colleagues, recovered and reorganized the company, sparing no effort in its management. On November 9th of this year, they held the first shareholders' meeting in Tianjin after the war, discussing the resumption of operations and production. Everything is in order, and this is truly a commemorative event.

The people regard food as heaven, and humans cannot eat bland food, so salt is an essential element of food. The Chinese "boiling sea" industry has existed since ancient times, but for thousands of years, people only knew how to eat "raw salt" and could not manufacture it scientifically. As modern trends opened up and new technologies emerged, this salt-making industry, which affected national health and national interests, was not established until the early years of the Republic of China by a few comrades at "Jiuda" who, through long-term efforts, succeeded. Their products include refined salt, reprocessed salt, brick salt, crystalline salt, washing salt, and all kinds of by-products. In addition to food, industrial salt and the chemical industry of salt are essential to the prosperity of various industries, and this deserves attention. Its main factory is located in Tanggu, Tianjin, and its sales extend to various ports along the Yangtze River and major cities. In January of the 26th year of the Republic of China, it was renamed "Jiuda Salt Industry Company," and the scope expanded, and the business flourished. Until July, when the Japanese invaders launched the "July 7th" Incident, North China fell, and the enemy completely seized the company's factories. The scope of Peiping (the residence of the founder, Jing, and the company's office) was also occupied. The cadres first went south, then west, to Sichuan to "start a new stove" (this classic term is indeed appropriate). According to the report of the chairman of this conference, they retreated with the national army and engaged in "boiling well" in Zigong, Sichuan, supporting the salt industry in the southwest, enabling the southwestern people to experience scientific salt, and jointly dedicated themselves to increasing production during the war. Eight years of hardship have created many moving and praiseworthy historical events, and now they have embarked on the road to revival. This kind of miracle is not found in other companies and is truly worthy of boasting!

During the eight years of the Japanese occupation of the Jiuda General Factory in Tianjin, they did not mention a word about the rights of Chinese shareholders but wantonly promoted the excellence of their industrial technology, the abundance of salt production, and the expansion of scale. However, the houses and machinery received by Jiuda after the victory were all damaged and dilapidated. Only half of the chimneys were left in the Tanggu salt factory. The company's office building in the Qing district was occupied by the enemy's military police, and all the sundries on the upper floor were taken away when they surrendered, and even the locks on the doors were removed. It is known that the Japanese only knew how to seize assets, retaining the accumulated habits of pirates, which is ridiculous and hateful.

At the meeting place, the founder, Jing Sou, took the stage. This old man, in his seventies, has experienced the vicissitudes of life, but he is still healthy and strong. He was a successful candidate in the Zhejiang list of the Gui Mao year, and Liang Hongzhi of the pseudo "Reformed Government" and Wang Yitang of the pseudo "North China Political Affairs Commission" were all successful candidates from the same year in the rural examinations (Liang from the Fujian list, Wang from the Jiangnan list). Seeing that Liang and Wang are infamous for ten thousand years, one feels that it is even more rare to be able to preserve one's reputation like Jing Sou. However, Jing Sou is the head of the board of directors, overseeing the overall situation, while the general manager, Fan Xudong, bore the greater responsibility for the actual management and struggle. Thirty years of complex roots, the storms and waves after the "July 7th" Incident, were difficult to deal with, and his talent was truly exceptional. Sadly, he died of overwork in Chongqing shortly after the victory. Thinking of Lu You's will in his poem: "When I die and the Royal Army has pacified the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice!" Mr. Fan was able to see the restoration and die, which is enough to make him proud of Lu You.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Three On Stage and Off Stage (14)

At this moment, Qiyun had already gone on stage, dressed as Su San, kneeling on the stage, and everyone was quietly listening to her sing. Only Fengsheng was still chattering, asking what the play was about, why Su San was a criminal, and why there was a trial. Yun Qing initially told her, but later, seeing that she didn't pay attention, didn't want to say more, and just told her to watch quietly, and she would understand. Fengsheng couldn't understand, looking around, criticizing at will, saying that the rouge on Qiyun's face was too red, that the back of her hands were covered with snow cream, and that her nose was too big, like an elephant's, that the singing was too harsh, and that the play was too boring and didn't make people laugh at all. Little Wang's mother was sitting next to her, and she heard everything she said, smiling with pursed lips from time to time, and occasionally casting a glance or two at Zhuzhai. Zhuzhai was so anxious that he was sweating all over, wishing he could go over and shut Fengsheng's talkative mouth. Looking at Qiyun on the stage, she kept glancing at Fengsheng while singing. This "Yu Tang Chun" was originally Zhuzhai's favorite play, and he wanted to take the opportunity to appreciate its merits so that he could discuss it with Qiyun tomorrow. Now, with Fengsheng's interference, he was disturbed and didn't hear a word of the play on stage. In a daze, this act of "Yu Tang Chun" ended. He hurriedly led Fengsheng and Yunqing out, as if escaping, and squeezed out of the door to return home. At home, this talkative lady continued to criticize, saying that Xueqing was really wasting money to invite them to see such a play today. Zhuzhai was full of anger and had nothing to say to this lady. He figured that Little Wang's mother must have told Qiyun everything Fengsheng said, and he felt uneasy the next day when he didn't go to see Qiyun. At the bank, he felt depressed, as if he had lost something.

He endured until after three o'clock in the afternoon, his mind wandering, and he couldn't help but want to risk going to see Qiyun to apologize in person. But he didn't have the courage. While he was struggling, the telephone on the desk suddenly rang. Zhuzhai picked it up and heard that it was Qiyun calling. His blood immediately boiled, and he answered with a trembling mouth: "I am Xu Zhuzhai!" He heard Qiyun giggle twice and say: "Mr. Xu: Why didn't you come this morning? Are you getting off work soon? I have something to tell you. Wait for you at the Yabei foreign restaurant at five o'clock. Do you have time?" Zhuzhai repeatedly replied: "Yes, yes, I'll be there, I'll be there!" He heard another soft laugh on the other end, a "Goodbye", and the phone hung up. Zhuzhai, after being disappointed, suddenly received a call from Qiyun, inviting him to go. He was flattered and extremely excited. He was almost ecstatic. He had no mood to check the many accounting documents arranged on the desk. He put them all in the drawer and paced back and forth in the room, watching the second hand of the large clock on the wall move, one second at a time. Zhuzhai's heart was getting more and more nervous. Although he was excited, he felt embarrassed when he thought about how to explain to Qiyun when they met, so that she could understand what Fengsheng had said last night. He was afraid that Qiyun, because she had heard Little Wang's mother's report, would make an appointment today to question him, which would be terrible! And she once said on the phone, "I have something to tell you," is it for this matter? It's even more worrying. Within this half hour, Zhuzhai was suddenly happy and suddenly worried. If he went, he was afraid she would question him; if he didn't go, he felt he would miss the opportunity, and he felt a little unsure. (End of this chapter)

### The Heart of a Woman

— Feng Yunzhuang

The Bible once mentioned that when God created humans, he ran out of materials when creating women, so he had to piece them together, using Adam's rib to make the woman. Later, I don't know if it was through several degrees of evolution or degeneration? It is said that the heart of a woman is the most poisonous. This is not surprising, because the more suppressed they are, the deeper the resentment they accumulate, and once it erupts, it is naturally difficult to control. Moreover, the eyes of society are inherently snobbish. It is considered natural for people to beat dogs, but it is heinous for dogs to bite people. Therefore, stories such as Zhang Xun killing his concubine to encourage his soldiers, and Lord Pingyuan beheading the head of a beauty to apologize to his guests, have been passed down through the ages as beautiful tales. However, if Liu murdered her husband, it was necessary to parade her around the four gates and sing small tunes to humiliate her. After the humiliation, she was subjected to dismemberment before everyone felt satisfied. Even in today's free, equal, and democratic society, the news of Zhan Zhou killing her husband is more sensational than the news of a man murdering his wife because of an affair, because women have always been regarded as inferior animals.

The women's movement began in the second half of the eighteenth century, and some people advocated it, such as Goge and Madame Roland in France, and Ms. Wales Dongkelaft in England. They all advocated that men and women should receive the same education and undergo the same vocational training, so that they can support themselves and not depend on men. However, in this society, it is not easy to support oneself. And even if women can be self-reliant, because of the lack of public kitchens and nurseries, women still have to bear the double responsibility of career and family. Rich men like their wives to be full-time housewives. Poor men, when they are short of money, naturally have to allow their wives to go out to work to reduce their burden. However, before long, when their own income increases, they still hope that their wives can return to the kitchen and settle down. Therefore, working women are greatly affected in marriage, and at the same time, it is not easy to achieve success and comfort in their careers. Therefore, although the advocates of the women's movement speak earnestly, most women in society still listen with indifference.

Moreover, it would be fine if women could always stay at home and be housewives forever, but men's hearts are not very stable, and their status and income are also very unstable, so it is not easy for women to adapt to their requirements. Many talented or beautiful women have wandered around outside, and it is impossible to enter the cage again, because in terms of population ratio, even if there are not necessarily more women than men, it is now too expensive to rent houses and buy furniture. Many men who should get married cannot afford wives. Among the few men who can afford families, it is not easy to accommodate so many women waiting to be married. However, the constitution clearly stipulates monogamy, so many women who are "unmarried" or feel that being single and engaged in a career is too hard have a prostitution mentality, because they can not only obtain sexual satisfaction, but also solve economic problems, so why not do it?

Especially women who live in Shanghai for a long time, when people hear that she has made a boyfriend with a lavish hand, who gave her iron rings, cars, and foreign houses, everyone will cast envious eyes on her. On the contrary, if her boyfriend is poor, and she helps him in business or financially, people will despise her as if she is paying for him. Alas, those engaged in the women's movement should strive to eradicate this kind of prostitution mentality!

### Talking about "Freedom"

— Shaorong

Freedom will not descend upon a nation; a nation must strive to attain freedom. It is a happiness that must be earned before it can be enjoyed. — Colton

Freedom and unity are inseparable; it is so now, and will be so forever. — Webster

When freedom is lost, life becomes uninteresting and loses its flavor. What is life? It is not walking around, breathing fresh air, or looking at the sun; it is to be free. — Edison

### Between Public and Private

— Wang Baili

Humans are not plants or trees, so who can be without feelings? However, "feelings" must be separated into public and private. Public is public, and private is private. Public and private must be clearly distinguished. But if you want to clearly distinguish the boundaries between public and private, you must have a calm mind or be regarded as a "fool." It is said that when Jiang Taigong beheaded Daji, when Daji was tied to the execution ground, Taigong ordered the executioner to behead her. The executioner looked at Daji's face, and "half of his soul flew away," his hand bones weakened and he couldn't remember what to do, and the knife also fell to the ground. Taigong shouted to kill again, but the result was still the same. Taigong knew that this was because Daji's beauty had stopped his "killing heart," so he used cloth to wrap Daji's face and ordered the executioner to kill again. As a result, he was easily separated from his body. I believe that Daji's "beauty" is private feeling, and the "cloth" covering her face is public affairs. People who handle official business must have such a "cloth" to perform their tasks; otherwise, their hand bones will weaken, and the knife will fall to the ground. However, Su Wenxu of the Han Dynasty did not have this cloth and could still keep public and private separate. This is where Su Gong was extraordinary. The Han Shu Su Zhang Zhuan Lue says: "Zhang was the governor of Jizhou. A former friend was the governor of Qinghe and committed many corrupt acts. Zhang went to inspect the area and was about to arrest him, so he invited the governor, set up wine and delicacies, and talked about their lives with great joy. The governor was happy and said: Everyone has one heaven, but I have two heavens. Zhang said: Today, Su Wenru drinks with an old friend, which is private kindness; tomorrow, the governor of Jizhou will investigate the case, which is public law. He directly corrected his crime, and the county officials were cleared." I think: If Su Gong was born today, he would definitely be a famous general in "fighting tigers."
