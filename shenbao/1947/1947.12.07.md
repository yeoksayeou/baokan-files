### The Soviet Union's Reply to Japan's Peace Conference Note Has Been Delivered to the Soviet Side; Reiterating Its Position and Hoping for an Early Preparatory Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Our government's reply to the Soviet Union's note of November 27 regarding the convening of a peace treaty with Japan was personally delivered to Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Fedlin on the morning of the 4th when Foreign Minister Wang met with him. According to authoritative sources speaking to reporters, the content of the reply does not change our position. In addition to reiterating our country's suggestions, it also provides explanations, hoping that the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan can gain the support of the Soviet Union and the United States and the United Kingdom on a possible basis, so that it can be convened as soon as possible. The person did not want to speculate on the consequences of this note, but believed that in this matter, the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union have gone to extremes, while our country's opinions are moderate and feasible. If the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union must insist on their original positions "and are unwilling to make concessions to agree to the possible basis provided by our side, they do not know what other ways can be adopted unanimously by the four countries. The Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in London still has no possibility of reaching an agreement on important issues of the peace treaty with Germany. These matters are indeed related. In order to completely stop the war in law, all major powers should quickly cooperate on the issues of the East-West peace conferences and comprehensively break the deadlock.

[Central News Agency, London, 6th] An external spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter today that the British government has not yet responded to the Soviet Union's recent note suggesting that the foreign ministers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union hold a meeting in China to discuss the peace treaty with Japan.

### US Emergency Foreign Aid Bill to Undergo Final Vote Next Week

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The US House of Representatives completed the general debate on the $590 million emergency foreign aid loan bill this afternoon. After the various amendments are proposed on the 8th, it will be discussed again, and then the final vote will be taken on the 9th. More than a dozen members of Congress (mostly Republicans) gave speeches for or against the bill in a half-empty chamber, with sometimes fewer than fifty members present. It was finally passed that various amendments to the bill would be proposed next week.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Congressional leaders today disregarded the House of Representatives' attempt to cut $590 million in foreign aid funds and firmly insisted on passing the bill before the end of next week and submitting it to the President for signature and implementation. In addition, Deputy Secretary of State Lovett declared yesterday that the current strikes in France and Italy were instigated by the Communist Party, which shows that the Soviet Union's foreign policy has expanded, and the American people must not flinch and fall into the Communist Party's trap.

[This newspaper's report] Regarding the 60 million emergency relief funds that still need to be passed by the US Congress, financial figures here estimate that the total deposits of all commercial banks in Shanghai are about 1.8 trillion yuan. The 60 million yuan will be allocated in three installments. Each installment, if converted at the black market exchange rate for US dollars, will exceed the total deposits in Shanghai, which will have a very large impact on commodity prices. At least the price increase during the Lunar New Year can be invisibly eliminated. In summary, if the emergency relief is entirely used to stabilize prices, it will definitely have a good effect, but if it is used for military purposes, it will be another matter. Regarding the funds required for currency reform, various parties have different estimates, with very large differences in the amounts. According to the views of the aforementioned people, the psychological factor is the most important in this matter. As long as the US government can express its determination and take active action, even if the currency reform fund is only 200 to 300 million US dollars, if people's hearts are stabilized, our country's foreign exchange assets escaping overseas and remittances from overseas Chinese are expected to be recovered in large part, then currency reform will have the possibility of success.

### Life Magazine Editorial Supports Aid to China Demands

[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Life magazine recently published an editorial on the US policy toward China and its relationship to US party politics, supporting the Republican leader's demand for aid to China. It also stated that the US policy toward China should take the same steps as its policy of containing totalitarian aggression in other places. The magazine believes that Marshall's proposal for $300 million in emergency aid to China is vague, slow, and inappropriate. The editorial stated that while the State Department is busy handling the aid to Europe plan, the Chinese Communist Party, using weapons manufactured in Siberia and transported to the Communist areas via Lushun and Dalian, has occupied most of the Northeast and half of North China, and has turned these provinces into "the world's second largest communist area after the Soviet Union." The article then asks: "If Soviet strategists can take care of two or more battle lines at the same time, then why can't the United States do this?" The editorial hopes to immediately restore aid to independent China. The article also said: The United States' procrastination and the Communist Party's great benefits have made the issue of aid to China a matter of life and death for China. Therefore, the most urgent task at present is to determine a policy so that aid can be effective and enable Chairman Chiang to win the war, and not allow the United States to abandon its old allies.

### After the Dissolution of the National Government Committee, a Senate May Be Established; Government Committee Members to Be Placed as Presidential Advisors

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 6th] The organizational principles of the Presidential Palace Organization Law are still under discussion by the authorities. The authorities are also considering the future of the Government Committee members after the establishment of the Presidential Palace and the dissolution of the National Government Committee. Some people believe that the Government Committee members have made outstanding contributions to promoting constitutional government and should not be abandoned when constitutional government begins. Therefore, it is reasonable to arrange for them. Another proposal is to form a Senate, but the position of the elders should be senior advisors to the President, assisting the President in solving important national problems in an informal manner and without real power. Whether it belongs to the Presidential Palace is unknown.

### Legislative Yuan Debates Postal Rate Case; Final Vote Recommends Government Submit to the Yuan for Review; Passes Bill to Increase Legal Interest Rate

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 6th] The Legislative Yuan held its 341st regular meeting at 9:00 AM on the 6th. When Sun Ke, the Yuan President, announced the National Government's special permit for the Executive Yuan to adjust postal rates at any time, it caused a fierce debate that lasted a long time. Afterwards, the following proposals were passed: Amendment to Article 29 of the Postal Law; Irrigation Enterprise Encouragement Ordinance; Amendment to the Self-Defense Firearm Management Ordinance; Amendment to the names of the Huaihe River, Yellow River, Yangtze River, North China Pearl River, and other five water conservancy engineering bureaus, and the revision of the accounting and personnel articles in the relevant organizational regulations; Amendment to Article 1 of the Organizational Regulations of the Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs; Passage of the National Bank Staff Appointment and Removal Ordinance; Increase in the legal interest rate. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. (The full text of the Interest Rate Management Ordinance, the amendment to Article 29 of the Salt Administration Ordinance, and the amendment to Articles 3, 5, 6, and 9 of the Self-Defense Firearm Management Ordinance are published in columns 2, 3, and 4 of the second edition.)

[Another dispatch] At the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 6th, the proposal regarding the adjustment of postal and telecommunications rates sparked a debate lasting one hour and forty-five minutes. The final vote passed the motion by Wang Peiren and other members, expressing disagreement with the State Council's special permit for the Executive Yuan to adjust postal and telecommunications rates at any time, and recommending that any increase in postal rates still be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.

### Committee Members Speak Out

The proposal was "The National Government's State Council's resolution that, during the period of mobilization and suppression of the rebellion, the Executive Yuan is specially permitted to adjust postal and telecommunications rates at any time, and this Yuan is hereby notified." After Secretary-General Lou Tongsun read the proposal, Committee Member Liu Chiping took the lead in criticizing the government for infringing on the powers of the Legislative Yuan and illegally changing the law by decree. Yuan President Sun Ke immediately explained the process by which the State Council passed the proposal. More than twenty committee members then spoke, raising various opinions on the proposal.

Regarding the adjustment of postal rates, this is the second discussion in the Legislative Yuan regarding the recent proposal to adjust postal rates. The first time was when the Executive Yuan, in order to facilitate automatic adjustment of postal rates, requested amending Article 4 of the Postal Law regarding the postal rates in the attached table, so that future postal rate adjustments would not need to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. After the proposal was submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review by the National Government, it was rejected. Committee members insisted that it concerned increasing the people's burden and should still be passed by the Legislative Yuan, and that Article 4 of the Postal Law should not be amended. The Executive Yuan believed that the postal and telecommunications losses were actually due to the increasing fluctuations in commodity prices, and that adjusting postal rates was originally to avoid subsidizing losses and seek symmetry between rights and obligations, avoiding a situation where a few people use postal and telecommunications services and the country subsidizes them, which would not increase the burden on all people. In the past, postal and telecommunications rate adjustments took a considerable amount of time to complete the legislative process, and commodity prices continued to rise, making it difficult to compensate for the losses. Therefore, it was decided to request the National Government to specially permit the Executive Yuan to adjust prices at any time. The State Council passed this at its 16th meeting and ordered the Legislative Yuan to be notified.

### Hong Kong Government Seizes Sovereignty Over Kowloon Walled City, Orders Eviction of Residents; We Reiterate Our Position and Have Not Abandoned Kowloon

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 5th] A Hong Kong government spokesman told a Central News Agency reporter on the 5th that the Hong Kong government will continue to abide by the statement issued on September 15 last year, explaining that the United Kingdom has administrative power over Kowloon Walled City. The spokesman said that the Hong Kong government will implement the eviction order issued by the Public Works Department on November 27, which aims to evict about 2,000 Chinese residents of Kowloon Walled City from their current 50 wooden houses. If they do not evacuate, the Hong Kong government "will order them to move." This matter is developing into a major political issue, as the Chinese residents who received the eviction order have organized a joint organization called the Sai On County Kowloon Walled City Residents Association. The association believes that Kowloon is Chinese territory and that China still retains sovereignty over the old Kowloon Walled City. However, the British authorities have different interpretations of their treaty rights and refused to allow the Baoan County authorities to establish a court in Kowloon Walled City last July. Guo Dehua, the special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, is currently in Nanjing, discussing this matter with the government. At the same time, the Hong Kong authorities have not yet taken action to demolish any houses of Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City. According to the eviction order issued by the Hong Kong government, Chinese residents in Kowloon Walled City must evacuate within six days, which is the stipulated deadline. In addition, the Office of the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi reiterated the Chinese government's statement on September 17, 1946, stating that China has not abandoned its administrative power over Kowloon. The Special Envoy's Office told the press on the 5th that Guo Dehua, the Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong, had met with Hong Kong Governor Grantham twice on November 29 and December 2, reiterating China's position on the administration of Kowloon. Special Envoy Guo stated that the Chinese government does not agree with the eviction order issued by the Public Works Department of the Hong Kong government on November 27.

### In Memoriam: Mr. Yu Songhua

— Shu Xincheng

When I saw the news of Mr. Yu Songhua's passing in Suzhou in Shanghai newspapers on October 12th, I couldn't help but sigh: another one of my good friends has fallen. I have sighed like this many times in recent years: Mr. Jiang Baili six or seven years ago, Mr. Lu Feibohong, Mr. Tao Xingzhi last year, Mr. He Bocheng, Mr. Chang Yansheng this year: I sighed like this every time they passed away. My sigh not only mourns the departed, but also feels a sense of loneliness as friends of similar age die one by one. At the same time, I also believe that when these friends passed away, they were all under sixty years old. From an anatomical and psychological perspective, their mental strength had not yet reached its peak, and it was precisely when they could have accomplished great things. They should not have died, yet they did. It is clear that their spiritual lives were cut short. The formation of a nation of sick people is already a loss to the country and society, but the mid-way curtailment of such spiritual lives is an even greater, irreparable loss. I believe that Mr. Songhua's death and the deaths of other gentlemen are all indicators of the severe losses suffered by the country and society. If we have no way to reduce the mid-way curtailment of spiritual lives, or even do not realize that their passing is a kind of curtailment, then what is the use of sighing?

Mr. Songhua and I became friends in the ninth year of the Republic of China when he was the chief editor of "Liberation and Reconstruction." At that time, we were both very young. I arrived in Shanghai in the early summer of the ninth year and had our first conversation at the "Shishi Xinbao." We both felt like we had met too late. Later, I taught and lectured in various provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei. He, on the other hand, always stayed in his position as a journalist. Even when he went abroad to study and investigate, he focused on journalism. Although we did not see each other often afterwards, we frequently exchanged news through writing, and our friendship deepened day by day. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, I moved to Shanghai to work for Zhonghua, and he worked for Shen Bao, so we had more time to spend together. After the August 13th Incident, he transferred to Singapore, and I often went to Hong Kong. He also came to Hong Kong several times for business, and we often met in Hong Kong. I arranged to have a conversation with him one morning upstairs at the Hong Kong branch of Zhonghua Book Company. That day was Sunday, and we agreed not to invite others to join us so that we could talk freely. Apart from sharing our personal lives and ideals for our careers, we freely discussed everything from the general trends of the world to the domestic situation. We both anticipated that Japan would launch a world war, and we drafted many "cultural national defense" plans on paper. Unexpectedly, the next morning, Hong Kong's airfield was already occupied by the Japanese army, and the Pacific War really broke out. From then on, we did not hear from each other for several years. This spring, I accepted an invitation from the Suzhou National Social Education College to teach a film course in the Department of Electrical Education, and I learned that he had long been the director of the Journalism Department at the college. I went to Suzhou once every two weeks. Before April, he was recuperating in Shanghai, so even though we were colleagues, we still hadn't met. It wasn't until May, when I accompanied Hu Mao-yi, a counselor from the League of Nations' Department of Culture and Education, and Shi Weizhi, the manager of the Encyclopedia Britannica Films Company, to visit Suzhou, that I went to Suzhou several times and had several long talks with him in the faculty dormitory of the college. I had been seriously ill and nearly died between the 31st and 33rd years of the Republic of China, so I paid special attention to the health of people over middle age and also had a special understanding of suffering from illness. Every time we talked, I felt that his body was too weak, and it would not be easy to recover without absolute and long-term rest. I advised him to give up everything and focus on recuperating. However, he was still as responsible as ever for the affairs of the college. During the student strike in May, he was still tirelessly guiding everything. After that, I did not go to Suzhou, and unfortunately, he passed away on October 11th.

Mr. Songhua has passed away. Everyone knows about his contributions to the country and society, and Mr. Cheng's biography also describes it in detail, so I don't need to say more. What I lament is that he was in the prime of his mental capacity. According to the results of anatomy and psychological research, his mental strength can still be said to be immature - a person's mental capacity only fully matures at the age of sixty - but he also died with Mr. Jiang, Lu Fei, Tao, He, Chang, and others. I believe that the country, society, and individuals should all be vigilant. In terms of individuals, modern scientists are working hard to study methods of controlling nature and society, but they uniquely neglect how to control themselves. From a biological point of view, the natural lifespan of human beings should be five times the age of physiological maturity, so the natural death period of a person should be between 100 and 125 years old. Even the average lifespan of Americans reached sixty years and three months last year. In our country, outstanding scholars such as Mr. Jiang, Tao, Bao, Chang, and Songhua, and outstanding entrepreneurs such as Mr. Lu Fei, and even the average lifespan of the country have not yet reached the age. One reason for this may be that one's diet and daily life are not entirely in line with the way to health, and even unintentionally or without time to study issues related to personal longevity. In fact, on the other hand, society is so turbulent, the economy is so chaotic, and the country and society provide so little security for the lives of scholars, that they are busy with life, busy with oil, rice, firewood, and salt, and busy with the education expenses of their children. By the time they are busy and get sick, there are neither free recuperation facilities, nor do they have to worry about the expenses of medical care in addition to the expenses of daily life. Under these circumstances, they are just human beings made of flesh and blood, so how can they withstand such torment?

Mr. Songhua and many of my friends died when their mental strength had not yet matured. We not only mourn our friends, but also lament for the country and society. We mourn Mr. Songhua, and at the same time, we hope that the individuals who have not died and the national authorities and social undertakings will be deeply vigilant: be vigilant that talent is not easy to come by, and how to plan in advance to reduce the causes that cause people to die early, so that they will no longer follow in the footsteps of Mr. Songhua and others. That would not only be the good fortune of the undying talent, but also the inescapable responsibility of those who control the country and society.

### Legislative Yuan Debate

(Continued from page one)

Three Different Opinions Today, when the committee members spoke, they fell into three categories of opinions: The first opinion was to advocate that the Legislative Yuan supplement the procedures, formulate a resolution, and stipulate that during the period of suppressing the rebellion, the Executive Yuan may adjust postal and telecommunications rates at any time. Those who held this view included Chen Guyuan, Chen Hong, Chen Haicheng, Zhong Tianxin, Huang Youchang, etc. The reason was that the current Legislative Yuan is not the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the constitution, and is a family with the Kuomintang government. The resolutions of the State Council lack a legal basis, but in fact, postal rates must be increased. It seems difficult for the Legislative Yuan's opposition to change the resolutions of the State Council, so a resolution should be formulated to give the resolutions of the State Council a legal basis. Chen Yang, Chen Haicheng, etc.

There are currently three bases for the Communist bandits in the Northeast, the main force is in the triangle area of ​​Jilin-Changchun-Siping, connecting with Songbei; another is the Jinxi Corridor, and the other is the southern Liaoning area.

Also, the National Army in the Gaiping area is in the suburbs, not in the city, also Gaiping. As for the next move of the bandits, it is feared that it will be in a month.

According to Liang Huasheng, of the two cities and 20 counties in Jilin Province, except for the two cities of Jilin and Changchun and Yongji County, most of the rest have fallen into the hands of the bandits. Today, Jiutai has not been recovered, and the Jilin-Changchun Road and the Changchun-Siping Road have not been opened.

### After Inspecting Northeastern Industry and Mining, Sun Zhaoqi Freely Discusses His Impressions

All Chinese people value Northeastern industry, but not all can understand the actual difficulties. They are not worried about the fluid situation. The military authorities attach great importance to the industrial and mining areas. The industry and mining can only show vigorous vitality after the situation stabilizes and develops. Among the five or six offensives of the communists, the losses to the industrial and mining areas were the greatest. Our observations show that at most, they have recovered to the state of October. It is still very difficult to restore the old appearance before May. The difficulty of the work currently undertaken is beyond what outsiders can know. I am deeply respectful of their spirit. In addition, I believe that close cooperation in all aspects is particularly important. Mr. Sun is scheduled to take a train to Beiping the day after tomorrow.

### Sharp Population Decline, Increased Unemployment: Dalian, a City of Poverty and Loneliness

U.S. Consul General in Dalian, Mr. Henninghoff, Speaks the Truth

"U.S. News Agency, Washington, 5th" The State Department announced today that U.S. Consul General in Dalian, Mr. Henninghoff, will not return to his post but will be assigned to a new position. Mr. Henninghoff returned to Washington five weeks ago. The affairs of the U.S. in the "free port" of Northeast China under Soviet occupation are temporarily being handled by Deputy Consul General Mr. Bartch.

In an interview with reporters today, Mr. Henninghoff explained that Dalian, once an important transportation center, is now completely paralyzed. Hunger, disease, and suffering are found everywhere among the greatly reduced population. Mr. Henninghoff himself has encountered extreme difficulties in all his daily work.

Technically, under the Sino-Soviet Agreement of August 14, 1945, Dalian is nominally a free port open to international commerce for all countries. However, Mr. Henninghoff said: "Even so, there is no other major seaport in these three northeastern provinces where the Iron Curtain is so thick and terrifying." American travelers are not allowed to enter, American commerce does not exist, and American property in the area once reached 200 million U.S. dollars.

In August, the State Department formally reiterated its earlier request in January that the Soviet Union open the port for trade. The August note stated: "Although two years have passed since the Japanese surrender, Dalian has not yet been opened to world trade, and representatives of American firms have not been allowed to occupy or even visit their properties on the outskirts of the city, which they have long owned." Mr. Henninghoff also said: "The population of Dalian is now only half of the 1.3 million in 1945. Due to the cutting off of railways and the blockade of the port, the only transportation is Chinese fishing boats and Soviet ships transporting military supplies to and from Soviet ports."

Poor Sanitary Conditions, Typhoid Fever and Smallpox are Rampant

"Unemployment is everywhere, poverty is increasing, and once bustling streets are now deserted. Many shops have closed.

The Soviet occupation forces control everything. There are 30,000 to 50,000 guard vehicles nearby. Travel within a ten-mile radius of the city is prohibited unless permission is obtained, and obtaining permission is difficult.

Medicine is scarce, and the water supply is insufficient. Sanitary conditions are very poor. During his stay in Dalian, cholera, typhoid fever, smallpox, and other diseases were rampant.

Prices are extremely high, so consulate staff rely on canned food for their livelihood. His most difficult problem is having to carry out his daily work in a "vacuum," almost completely isolated from the rest of the world. The Soviet Union has refused to allow Chinese radio operators to enter the country for months, and the Consul General's communications can only be maintained through Soviet communication agencies.

Mr. Henninghoff's New Post May Be to Work in Japan

"China Financial News Agency, Washington, 5th" The U.S. State Department announced today that Mr. Henninghoff, the U.S. Consul General in Dalian, who recently returned to the U.S. to consult with the Bureau, may be transferred to another position. A successor has not yet been announced. It is speculated that he may be reassigned to work in Japan because he is proficient in Japanese.

### Lovett Publicly Accuses the Soviets of Inciting Labor Strikes in France and Italy; Dulles Continues to Meet with French Authorities

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said on the 5th that the Soviet Union is promoting strikes and unrest in France and Italy to "intimidate" the United States into abandoning its aid to Europe plan. He told the Senate Appropriations Committee that while the labor strikes appear to be initiated by local Communist parties in France and Italy, they are in fact "an extension of Soviet foreign policy." Since the U.S. Congress approved an emergency relief plan for France, Italy, and Austria in mid-November, Lovett has for the first time formally attributed the domestic labor strikes and unrest in France and Italy to the Soviet Union. Referring to the labor strikes, he said: "You cannot ignore them, because the labor strikes are occurring while Congress is in session, subcommittees are starting to work, and the Four Foreign Ministers are meeting in London." He asked the committee to allocate funds to implement the U.S. emergency winter relief plan. "In some aspects, we must decide our position. If we want to study this matter, we cannot be intimidated by these strikes."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] Dulles is scheduled to return to London on the 7th.

[Reuters, Paris, 5th] Marshall's special advisor Mr. Dulles, held a special meeting with reporters in Paris on the 5th, expressing his admiration for the French people's efforts to maintain the integrity of their country. Regarding the criticism from the communists, he said that he did not consider the French Communist Party a French political party. He first stated: "I am one of the representatives of the U.S. delegation attending the Foreign Ministers' Conference, so this visit to Paris naturally requires the consent of Secretary of State Marshall. However, this does not mean that I have any official mission. My plan in Paris is entirely private in nature, and I hope to return to London as soon as possible on Sunday." Mr. Dulles continued: "I have already met with President Auriol, Prime Minister Schuman, and Finance Minister Mayer. I also plan to visit Justice Minister Marie and Socialist Party veteran Blum. The events in France will have a more decisive impact on the future of Europe than the current stage of debate at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. In the eyes of Americans, the events in France are more important than those in Italy. If human freedom suffers setbacks in France, Americans will be extremely concerned. I believe that the current events indicate a greater urgency for aid to Europe, and I expect the U.S. Republican Party to be more willing to support the aid to France bill as a result." When asked if he planned to visit General de Gaulle, he replied: "My trip is only to obtain information, not to negotiate anything with anyone, so I do not rule out the possibility of meeting with representatives of any French political party."

The parliament adjourned at 12:35 PM and will reconvene next Tuesday.

### Truman Calls for the Wise Use of National Resources

[Reuters, Everglades City, Florida, 6th] During his vacation in the South, President Truman presided over the dedication ceremony of the National Park here today and delivered a speech stating that the United States must closely protect its natural resources so that the United States can continue to be the home of freedom. He said that the various factors that build a great country are not fully known to people. Mutual assistance among citizens is one, the country's provision of a good life for the people is another, and citizens' recognition of the country's responsibility to the world is yet another. The wise use of natural resources is the foundation for the success of the country's various efforts. The peace question requires courage and effort as much as the war question. We want to keep our country prosperous, but if we cannot understand the lessons of other countries wasting national resources, there will inevitably be regrettable consequences.

### Marshall Proposes Unifying Germany's Politics and Economy: Advocates Removing Boundary Lines and Exchanging Materials

[United Press, London, 6th] It is reported that Marshall and Bevin will make another effort on the 6th to urge Molotov to abandon his stance and begin discussing the German issue. Marshall will force Molotov to answer whether the Soviet Union still regards Germany's 10 billion reparations as a condition for unifying Germany's economy. If the Soviet Union continues to insist, the hope of reaching an agreement quickly is slim. On the other hand, Molotov may also ask Britain and the United States whether they still plan to establish a separate government in West Germany or whether they can publicly announce that they will abandon this plan. It is increasingly believed that this is an important key to the current deadlock. If it cannot be broken, the current Foreign Ministers' Conference will follow in the footsteps of the previous Moscow Conference. It is rumored here that Marshall is already packing his bags and preparing to return home within a week. Marshall's staff denied this, saying that the four foreign ministers have just touched on the core of the German issue.

[United Press, London, 5th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall on the 5th demanded that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference end the current division of Germany and proposed five U.S. policies towards Germany: 1. Basic personal freedom. 2. The boundary lines of the occupation zones are removed, except for being regarded merely as boundary markers of the four occupation zones, so that the opinions and goods of the people throughout Germany can be freely exchanged. 3. There is a clear decision on the economic burden that the German people should bear. 4. The relationship between the Allied Control Council and the future German government must be determined. 5. Safeguarding European security to prevent future German aggression. Marshall said that the failure of the Four Powers to take action on Germany "has delayed Germany's and Europe's recovery and caused hundreds of millions of people to suffer tragic consequences." Marshall made this important statement of policy after dining with Molotov at the Soviet embassy. So far in the Four Power Conference, this is probably his first and most powerful appeal for practical action. At the same time, this was also the first private meeting between the two. At the subsequent Foreign Ministers' Conference, Molotov gave a stern rebuttal to Marshall's attack, saying that Marshall's reference to German unification "was merely a formal request for unification." Marshall's statement was "too narrow and therefore unjust." He accused Britain and the United States of trying to undermine the Four Power Agreement and announced that the Soviet Union would insist on its demand for $10 billion in reparations from Germany. Marshall asked the Four Powers to abandon general principles and immediately solve practical problems and explain what the true opinions on the peace treaty with Germany are. He severely criticized Molotov's statement on the establishment of an all-German government, saying that it was obvious that the Soviet Union wanted people who supported the Communist Party in Germany to occupy an important position in it.

### U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union Confirms: Soviet People are Buying up Goods

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett officially reported the details of the Soviet buying spree in Congress today.

Lovett told the Senate Appropriations Committee that the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union had replied to the State Department's request for further reports on the rumored Soviet economic crisis. (This crisis refers to the buying spree that occurred in various cities in the Soviet Union.) It is reported that Soviet buyers are buying up many goods, but their attention is focused on durable and storable goods (such as winter clothing and dry goods). Several stores in Moscow are temporarily closed under the name of "interior renovation", and even more stores are closed under the name of "inventory". All stores that continue to operate are doing booming business until the goods are sold out. U.S. reporters in Moscow have not been able to report on this buying spree by the Soviet people.

### The U.S. Explores China's Opinion on Sending International Troops to the Holy Land

[Reuters, New York, 6th] The New York Times reported from Lake Success today that the United States has explored with China the possibility of sending Chinese troops to the Holy Land as part of an international force in the event that the situation in Palestine becomes more serious and severe military fighting occurs. The U.S. suggested that the Chinese troops sent to the Holy Land be between two and three thousand, but so far, there has been no response from Nanjing. A U.S. government spokesman declined to comment on the previous statement, while others said that if a large-scale conflict occurs in the Holy Land, the United States will explore the attitudes of other countries.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 6th broadcast: Lake Success dispatch, after the Holy Land partition plan is passed, the international peacekeeping force may need to be used, but members of the Chinese delegation here have not heard anything about the rumor that the United States has consulted China on whether it can send troops to participate in the international peacekeeping force.

### Japan's Second New National Diet Scheduled to Convene on the 10th of This Month; Chaos Erupts Again in the National Diet Yesterday

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Japan's second National Diet is scheduled to convene on the 10th of this month. Although the periods of the first and second National Diets are connected, according to general regulations, the National Diet must adjourn for several weeks after it opens and formally discuss bills starting next spring. Yesterday, the Cabinet meeting believed that this adjournment was not of great significance and decided to request the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors to cancel this adjournment. After the opening ceremony on the 10th, it will continue to discuss various bills. [Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Today's plenary session of the Diet was not convened until 6:20 PM. The reason is that the Liberal Party proposed this morning that the Speaker failed to maintain order in the Diet and should hold a vote of no confidence against him. At that time, the bill on the national control of mineral mines had been submitted, and several members of the Diet were fighting each other and roaring on the podium. The government party proposed to restrain the Liberal Party members who were "behaving despicably". After negotiations throughout the afternoon, the Liberal Party agreed to withdraw its motion to hold a vote of no confidence, and the government also agreed to narrow the scope of its proposal. Of the eleven Liberal Party members who were originally to be punished, only three were punished.

### U.S. Banned Arms Shipments to the Middle East; The Situation in Palestine is Gradually Stabilizing; British Urgently Deploy Troops to Suppress Arab-Jewish Conflicts in Asia

[United States News Agency, Washington, 5th] The State Department announced today that the transportation of arms and ammunition to troubled areas in the Middle East has been prohibited. The State Department said that this policy also applies to similar items currently outside the United States, including lease-lend armaments and ammunition, and the sale of surplus U.S. military equipment and ammunition.

[United States News Agency, Washington, 5th] According to an announcement issued today, the U.S. State Department has advised its envoys currently stationed in the Middle East to be cautious to prevent any danger of damage to the lives and property of U.S. citizens. The announcement stated, "We have advised our personnel to avoid taking any actions that could be viewed as provocative or taking any unnecessary risks.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 6th] In the Mansieh district at the junction of Tel Aviv and Jaffa, more than 30 houses caught fire after a violent explosion yesterday, and are still burning at night. Intermittent gunfire between the two cities stopped on the morning of the 6th. Official statistics show that 33 Jews and 22 Arabs have died in the unrest in the past four days. Starting today, the entire territory of Palestine seems to have gradually stabilized, probably because the Grand Mufti Husseini ordered the Arab Higher Committee to cancel the large-scale demonstration scheduled for yesterday.

### Japan Dismantles Military Statues

### Important Resolutions Regarding Legislative Yuan Elections: Voters to Collect Ballots with ID Cards; Eliminating Fraudulent Voting and Preventing Duplication; Sent to the Central Election Headquarters for Final Review

[Our Reporter] The Election Office held its eighth election committee meeting yesterday at 11:00 AM, to discuss technical issues for the upcoming Legislative Yuan elections. Chairman Wu Guozhen, Zhang Xiaosong, Chen Baotai, Wang Lanseng, Li Junfu, and other committee members were present, adjourning at 5:00 PM. The important resolutions made at the meeting were as follows: During the Legislative Yuan elections, national ID cards will be used in place of voter registration certificates for ballot collection. The number of polling stations will be reduced from 263 to 156, with 30 for occupational elections and 126 for regional elections. For the Legislative Yuan elections, the first day will be for occupational voting, and the second and third days will be for regional voting. The above three points have been submitted to the Nanjing Central Election Headquarters for final review. According to Section Chief Chen Minshu, to ensure that every voter has an ID card, an announcement will be made in advance once the Central Election Headquarters approves the recommendations, allowing residents currently without ID cards to apply for them in time. This measure can prevent duplicate voting and eliminate fraudulent practices, as citizens with lower levels of education generally have no interest in voter registration certificates but are less willing to lend out ID cards, which are necessary for obtaining rice, coal, and sugar. Furthermore, ID cards have a photograph of the holder, making forgery difficult.

### Foreign Residents in Fanyu Road Area Raise Funds to Purchase Anti-Theft Equipment

Ma Bo Dong Initiates Reconstruction of Changning Police Station

[Our Reporter] The residence of Ma Boler, general manager of American Palm Olive Soap Company, at 150 Fanyu Road, was invaded by bandits on the 21st of last month. When the bandits were about to rob the house, Shao Yuanbin, the head of the Changning Police Station in charge of the area, was notified and led his officers to surround and suppress the bandits, killing one. Mr. Ma's residence was therefore preserved. Foreign residents in the vicinity, witnessing this, admired Shao's bravery and jointly hosted a banquet recently. During the banquet, they decided to raise funds to purchase transportation vehicles and improve equipment to enhance anti-theft capabilities. Mr. Ma himself, considering the narrowness of the Changning Police Station, invited 15 friends to form a fundraising committee to raise funds to rebuild the new station. Progress has begun actively.

The exercise lasted about an hour, with realistic performances and satisfactory results.

The North Station Police Precinct also held a large-scale suppression exercise last night, with excellent results.

### Three Japanese Class A War Criminals to be Indicted by Military Tribunal for Heinous Crimes of Arson, Murder, Rape

[Our Reporter] Three Japanese Class A war criminals, including Lieutenant General Sakuraba Shiro, have been investigated by the city's Military Tribunal and were indicted yesterday. The main points of the indictment are as follows:

Lieutenant General Sakuraba Shiro, 56 years old, from Aomori Prefecture, Japan, a graduate of the Army Military Academy, came to China in 1940 and held various important positions in the army. In 1945, he was promoted to commander of the 82nd Independent Mixed Brigade of the 20th Army, stationed in the Zhuzhou area of Hunan Province. He condoned his subordinates' acts of rape, murder, and plunder against our merchants and civilians. In Zhuzhou alone, over 300 compatriots were killed, over 100 women were raped, and countless others were abducted from other places, secretly killed, and their bodies disposed of to eliminate traces. In addition, he burned down over 200 houses in the area, causing incalculable losses to the people's property.

Major General Kurose Heiichi, 54 years old, from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, came to China in 1942, serving as the commander of the 133rd Regiment of the 20th Army, fighting in Zhejiang and Jiangxi. In 1943, he was promoted to commander of the 57th Infantry Brigade of the 68th Division of the 20th Army, participating in the Battle of Hengyang. He subsequently advanced to Qiyang, burning villages near the Liuhai Chong area of the county to the ground. He also ordered his troops to use machine guns to strafe unarmed civilians, resulting in dozens of deaths and property losses of over 100 million yuan. Afterwards, he abducted dozens of men and women, subjecting them to wanton rape and beatings, displaying extreme inhumanity.

Major General Kuriwa Shoji, 56 years old, from Nagano Prefecture, Japan, served as the commander of the Transport Regiment of the 3rd Division. In August 1937, he led his troops to land in Wusong, China, participating in the war. When his troops were stationed in the Taicang County area, due to a shortage of horses in the army, he forcibly requisitioned over 200 farming cattle from the local population without compensation, and immediately had these cattle moved with the army resulting in huge losses for our civilian population.

### Approximately Eight Thousand European Refugees in China Awaiting Repatriation; Stansby Arrives in Shanghai to Investigate

[Our Reporter] Mr. Stansby, a special representative of the Preparatory Committee of the International Refugee Organization, arrived in Shanghai from Geneva on the 25th of last month. When a reporter visited him yesterday, he said that the mission of this trip was to investigate the repatriation of refugees in the Far East, and discuss various related issues with Mr. Wang Renlin, the director of the Far East Branch, such as the difficulties in repatriation and ways to accelerate the repatriation process, so as to report to the General Assembly, and at the same time convey the opinions of the General Assembly. Mr. Stansby said: In addition to those who have been repatriated, there are still 8,000 European refugees in China waiting to be sent back, most of whom are currently concentrated in Hongkou and other places in Shanghai. As for overseas Chinese stranded in European countries, about 25,000 have been sent back to their original pre-war locations, and more than 25,000 are still awaiting repatriation. Most of them were residing in Burma, the Philippines, Singapore, and other places before the war, and very few returned to their hometowns in China.

### City Chamber of Commerce Cables Government, Urging Cautious Handling of Economic Measures; Rational Revision of the Ban on Remittances, Inadvisability of Blocking Loan Access

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the government's current economic stabilization measures lack careful consideration, and may lead to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. They specifically cabled the government, urging cautious handling to avoid hindering normal economic development due to isolated incidents. The main points are: Shanghai is still a relatively developed center for light industry and the distribution of daily necessities. Remittances to Shanghai for purchasing goods are a necessary phenomenon of mutual dependence between the urban economy and rural life. If the authorities do not address the root cause and apply blanket restrictions, although legitimate banks may stop accepting remittances, private institutions can still conduct transactions in secret. Furthermore, goods transactions can be transformed into fund transactions, which would not truly implement the policy. It only reduces the legitimate business of banks and drives fish into the deep, causing more capital to flow to the black market. It is bound to make finance more turbulent and uneasy. Moreover, if domestic funds are not allowed to be remitted out for legitimate use, how can it be guaranteed that they will not be used to hoard grain and monopolize raw materials locally? This will lead to speculative rises in agricultural products and imbalances in supply and demand, stimulating urban prices and escalating the situation. Focusing solely on price controls in one area will have adverse effects that reverberate throughout the whole economy. This was a lesson learned in the wartime rear and should not be repeated. It is proposed that the current ban on remittances be rationally revised. At present, it is the time for harvesting agricultural products, and industries and businesses urgently need loans to purchase materials. In recent years, the capital of commercial banks has been weak, relying entirely on the injection of funds from national banks. However, the Four Joint Offices have recently stopped national banks from lending, leading to even greater caution among banks. Not only will new loans not be made, but existing loans will also be recalled on schedule. The channels for industrial and commercial financing will inevitably become narrower, forcing them to turn to the black market for high-interest loans. This will inevitably hinder production and promote price increases. Therefore, it is not advisable to block access to legitimate industrial and commercial loans completely, so as to avoid escalating the situation and causing the economic emergency measures to have the opposite effect.

### Finance Bureau Not Considering Revision of House Tax Rate

[Our Reporter] The city's house tax collection method is based on 5% of the value assessed in 1937, multiplied by 180. The central government believes that this method is extremely unreasonable, as rents have risen significantly. The house tax rate should be based on current rents. The Ministry of Finance has instructed the city government to revise the house tax collection method. However, according to Finance Bureau Chief Tian Yongqian, the Ministry of Finance's method is difficult to implement, as homeowners may not report their actual rents to the authorities. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has not yet considered the above method.

### Cheng Tianru, Involved in the Xu Jizhuang Case, Submits a Statement of Defense

[Our Reporter] In the case of Xu Jizhuang, former director of the Postal Remittances Administration, and others being accused of corruption, Cheng Tianru, the managing director of Zhenye Bank, was implicated. The police believe he is suspected of concealing fugitives. The case is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. Yesterday, Cheng submitted a statement to the District Prosecutor's Office in defense. The statement stated that the incident occurred around 7:00 PM on the 14th of last month. He went to 22 Tai'an Road at the invitation of lawyer Zhang Yaoguang to discuss the issue of lawyer fees for Xu Jizhuang's defense. Suddenly, plainclothes officers entered the house, claiming to be checking household registrations. Because he did not know the identity of the officers, he was inevitably alarmed. He arrived in car number "13690," which was parked outside. Fearing that the car would be robbed, he signaled for the car to leave. Later, the plainclothes officers identified him as Xu Jizhuang. After checking the photo, they realized their mistake. Only then did he realize that the officers were from the police station. In fact, there was only one door at 22 Tai'an Road. If Xu Jizhuang were inside, there would be no way to escape. Therefore, Xu Jizhuang's failure to be apprehended had nothing to do with him. He feels wronged to be listed as a defendant.

### Railway Police at Zhenjiang Station Crack Down on Smuggling of Military Weapons; Three Cases Discovered, One Suspect Arrested

[Our Reporter] The Railway Bureau Police Department recently issued a detailed report on the crackdown on the major smuggling of military weapons at Zhenjiang Station. It stated that at around 10:00 AM on the 29th of last month, a porter, No. 87, received a green travel bag from a passenger on the fifth京沪line train. After leaving the station, the owner of the bag was not seen following, so he reported it to the military police stationed at the station. Upon opening the bag for inspection, they found a Czech-style light machine gun, serial number 118-7, as well as two spare barrels and six magazines. The military police confiscated the items. After this incident, the Police Department immediately sent officers to investigate. At around 12:00 AM that night, when the ninth train arrived, a soldier was carrying a heavy travel bag, looking flustered, intending to escape towards the engine room exit. The railway police spotted him, ordered him to stop, and searched him. They found a Czech-style light machine gun, four magazines, and six types of parts for a Japanese Type 96 light machine gun. The soldier was arrested and interrogated. He confessed that his name was Wang Zhenchao, and he was instigated by Li Xueming. He also stated that Li might continue to transport military weapons to Zhenjiang on the 30th. More police officers were dispatched to inspect the small inns near the station. At around 7:00 PM on the 30th, it was reported that a tea server at the Dachang Hotel had received a wicker trunk from a soldier of unknown surname. The military police, upon hearing the news, immediately went to open it. Shockingly, it contained more machine gun parts, which could be assembled with the ones previously confiscated into a complete machine gun. Furthermore, Wang Zhenchao confessed that he had lived at Cui Qingyao's place, the security company commander for the 74th Division's Heavy Equipment Battalion, at 74 Yidu Wharf, Daxi Road, Zhenjiang, for a long time. The Police Department immediately sent undercover agents to investigate. Cui claimed that he did know Wang Zhenchao, but he had no knowledge of his actions outside. The Railway Police Department attaches great importance to this case, believing that it may be a planned conspiracy to disrupt the security of the two railway lines.

### Wu Kaixian Departs to Return to Shanghai

### Social Bureau Rules on Compensation for Taoist Temple Employees

[Our Reporter] The employees of the five Taoist temples in the city, including Baiyun Guan, Tongbai Gong, Qingchu Guan, and Sanmao Gong, previously requested that the temples handle the disposal of tin foil ash in the same way as Buddhist associations, but this was not accepted by the Taoist Association. The various Taoist temples believed that the tin foil ash should belong entirely to the temples. After mediation by the Social Bureau failed, it decided on a ruling to resolve the matter as follows: (1) Open accounting system for small accounts; all staff can share equally, abolishing the manager's 20% share. (2) The basic monthly wage is calculated at one yuan, one yuan and fifty cents, and two yuan.

### Rural General Council Employees Reach Agreement on Retirement Benefits

[Our Reporter] The American Rural General Council was forced to close down when the Pacific War broke out. At that time, Chairman Fan Keling announced its dissolution and stipulated that the 30+ employees including Song Zuyi would be paid six months' salary rice subsidies and all these years' savings. However, due to the sudden changes in the economic situation and the freezing of bank funds, the association could not allocate the funds and changed them to vouchers, stating that they would be exchanged for cash when business resumed. After the victory, the association resumed business, but the savings and rice subsidies of the former employees had not yet been issued. After the unemployed workers requested mediation from the Social Bureau, a settlement record was signed yesterday: (1) The 35 unemployed workers including Song Zuyi will be dismissed with severance pay from the employer. (2) The severance pay shall be issued by the employer based on the accumulated system used by the General Council in the past to obtain the retirement fund base, multiplied by the November worker's cost of living index of 53100 times. If the base is less than 50 yuan, it will be calculated as 50 yuan. (3) After receiving the severance pay, the labor side shall not make any further requests to the employer.

### Yue Opera Actress Loses Child Custody Case; Reaches Settlement in Court, Child Still Returned to Father

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yue Opera actress Shen Meiying and her former lover Zhang Yongsheng were fighting over their child. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Huixiu of the Civil Division of the Liu Bu District Court advised them to reach a settlement. They signed a settlement record in court, and the child will still be returned to the father for raising. This child custody case has thus come to an end. Shen Meiying and Zhang Yongsheng had an affair and lived together in 1943. Later, due to disagreements, they signed an agreement to end their cohabitation on February 19, 1944. At the time of cohabitation, Shen was already pregnant. It was agreed that if a boy was born, the father would take him. Later, Shen gave birth to a boy, who was taken back by the Zhang family and named Tianren. He is now three years old and is being raised by Zhang's wife, Wang Qiufang. On the 6th of last month, Shen Meiying asked someone to borrow 5 million yuan from Zhang, which Zhang refused. Shen became angry and brought people to Zhang's house to cause trouble, injuring Zhang's wife and taking the child away. The District Procuratorate prosecuted this case, and the Criminal Division of the District Court sentenced Shen to 60 days of detention, suspended for two years, and ordered her to pay 340,000 yuan in medical expenses. However, the child had not been returned, so Zhang applied to the Civil Division of the District Court to order the return of Tianyou and declare provisional execution.

### Strengthening Self-Defense Organizations, Support Required for Participation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan believes that as constitutional government is approaching, banditry is still rampant, and in order to promote the spirit of democracy, mobilize the people's strength, and eliminate obstacles to constitutional government, he sent a telegram to the Municipal Council to cooperate sincerely with the government. The telegram stated: Local governments, in order to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion, enrich self-defense organizations, mobilize manpower and material resources, and even temporarily hold special self-defense taxes and levies, are all required by the situation and cannot be avoided. Since it is for the benefit of the people, the people will naturally be happy to contribute. However, since it concerns the people's burden, it must first be submitted to the council for approval in accordance with the law before it can be implemented. It is hoped that councils at all levels will fairly review the emergency measures adapted to mobilization by governments at the same level. If it is indeed necessary to suppress the rebellion, they must do their utmost to provide support and focus attention on the supervision and inspection of implementation.

### Jiangxi's Red Earth Is Desolate, No Porcelain in Porcelain Street, from Goyang to Nanchang

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 4th] In the eastern part of Jiangxi Province, the railway has not been repaired far beyond Goyang, and it is necessary to travel by car on the highway. After crossing the Xin River, it is simply a desolate scene. On the famous red earth of Jiangxi, red grass as tall as a foot grows, and there is no sign of human habitation for dozens of miles. Arriving at Zuofeng, we saw grotesque rocks, and in the distance, there were some red-leaved trees and green trees. Near Guixi, we could see more than a hundred households. The Guixi Bridge is under construction. From this road to Yingtan, there is a distance of almost fifty kilometers, but the scattered fields in the wilderness, especially the half-demolished houses left over from the bombings, are built of red stone, giving an indescribable feeling.

Intersection and Distribution Center for Local Products

Yingtan is the intersection of the Xin River and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and it is an important transportation hub. It is a distribution center for rice and porcelain in Jiangxi, and it is a very important place. We sincerely hope that it can gradually recover.

After the car passed Tengtan, the desolate situation seemed to be better. There was a lot of land, and it was already being cultivated. There were also farmers working in the fields with three or four cows. Looking at Dongxiang, only about 30% of the land was barren. Villages were everywhere, and red leaves grew all over the mountains and fields. Arriving at Xiabu Settlement, most of the fields have been harvested, and there is a considerable amount of cultivated land. The corners are full of red leaves, mixed with deep green branches, which makes them appear more vigorous and powerful. Beyond Jinxian, the land became barren again, but the highway is a straight line, and it is still a straight line to Linchuan, about fifteen kilometers long.

Liangjiadu Bridge Under Reconstruction

Liangjiadu Ferry, this is the main stream of the Fu River, and the river surface is very wide. In the past, the railway built the Liangjiadu Bridge here. It was bombed once during the retreat, and then bombed again when it was seen that the enemy was not coming, and then bombed again. The enemy also bombed it once when they came, so the destruction of this bridge can be said to be the most thorough. Now, after the efforts of Huang Shouyi, the director of the Second Bridge Engineering Office of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, a steel plate girder bridge with 14 spans, each 35 meters long, is being built again. Each span of this length is the first time in China. The bridge was originally intended to use steel plate girders, but the steel plate needs to be shipped from Canada next year. Therefore, Director Huang designed to salvage the destroyed steel plate girders and select the good ones for lengthening. Director Huang led us to see the workshop, and they were all working hard.

Nanchang City Looks at Municipal Culture

When we arrived in Nanchang, night had already fallen. The uneven roads in the urban area, the dim street lights, have been destroyed and still need time and effort to rebuild.

Nanchang City has a population of 264,500. Jiangxi Province has a population of more than 13.7 million. The area of Jiangxi is larger than that of Fujian and Zhejiang and Jiangsu, but the population is not as large as that of the three provinces of Jiang, Zhejiang, and Fujian, so it is no wonder that it is so desolate.

Nanchang has the National Zhongzheng University, which is located on Wangcheng Slope, about 11 kilometers from the city. It has five colleges: liberal arts, science, law, engineering, and agriculture. There are more than 1,300 students, but only 20,000 books in the library and not many instruments. There are also a sports school, a music school, and a library with 50,000 thread-bound books and 10,000 ordinary reading books.

We went to visit Jieshi Park and Baihuazhou. Baihuazhou is in the center of Dong Lake. The locals said that the lake is always smelly. When asked why they don't dredge it, they said there is no money.

Youmin Temple, Shadows of the Previous Dynasty

There is a historical temple in the area called Youmin Temple. Inside is a bronze Buddha. The old monk said that it weighs 108,000 kilograms and is 1.6 zhang tall. It is said that it was cast during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang in the Five Dynasties. At that time, the temple was called Dafosi, then changed to Yongning Temple in the Tang Dynasty, Youming Temple in the Ming Dynasty, Youqing Temple in the Qing Dynasty, and Youmin Temple in the Republican era. This is a very interesting story. During the Ming Dynasty, Prince Ning Chenghao conspired to rebel here. His wife, Consort Lou, tried to stop him but he would not listen, so she cut her hair and wrote "Hanping" in large characters before committing suicide. Consort Lou's tomb is still located on the banks of the Gan River, alongside the poor people. The tomb is desolate, and only a few pillars remain of the archway. The stone lions have broken legs and are lying on the ground.

Zhongzheng Bridge Under Repair with Donations

The famous Tengwang Pavilion has also disappeared. Only one horizontal inscribed board is still left in the Tengwang Pavilion Elementary School on Porcelain Street. In the Water Police Headquarters next to the elementary school, a few stone stools can still be found. And on Porcelain Street, not a single porcelain shop can be found. The scenic spots and historical sites in Nanchang are very dilapidated. The Zhongzheng Bridge, which is a kilometer long, is extremely dilapidated. It is said that the locals are raising funds to repair it.

There are thirty to forty porcelain shops in Nanchang, and the major business is still in Jiujiang. Rice costs 400,000 yuan per dan, which is relatively cheap. However, the common people do not have large-scale production methods and are still very poor. This year's harvest is 80% for early rice and 60-70% for late rice. This is the situation in eastern Jiangxi.

Building a Bridge, Repairing the Main Artery

In Nanchang, we met Ouyang Cheng, the director of the Third Bridge Engineering Office of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He wanted us to visit the Gan River Bridge project, but we could not go due to time constraints. However, the Gan River Bridge is the only major bridge on the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. In the current era of Jiangxi's vast land and sparse population, and in the poor situation of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, they are eager to repair this artery to revive Jiangxi. This spirit is admirable. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Large-Scale Police-Bandit Battle Near Xiaoji Mountain in Wuxi, Five Robbers Killed, One Robber Sentenced to Immediate Execution

[Report from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 5th] The "Yihuang" Ding Shan scheduled boat of the Rong Sen Steamboat Bureau of Tonghui Bridge in this county, towing a "Anzai" tugboat, carrying more than 70 passengers, sailed from Yixing Ding Shan to Wuxi on the 4th of this month. At noon, it stopped at the Hutai Town wharf in the Outang Bridge area to pick up passengers. Unexpectedly, six people dressed in plain clothes and military uniforms, hiding short guns, mixed in with the passengers. When the boat reached Anqiao, they took out their pistols, intimidated the passengers, and checked their identity cards, arbitrarily searching and looting. None of the passengers on the boat were spared. They were robbed of cash, gold rings, etc., with losses of more than 100 million yuan. The bandits fled towards Zhangshe Shamao Bridge. The Zhangshe self-defense team immediately sent many members to tail them. They encountered the bandits in the area from Hutai Town to Yaowan, and a fierce battle broke out. The bandits could not hold out and retreated. At that time, the fifth bus of the Jiangnan Automobile Company arrived from Wuxi. The five bandits jumped into the bus and forced the driver to drive away at high speed. One bandit was slightly slower in his movements and was captured by the self-defense team. A No. 2 homemade box gun was found on him. He was interrogated in the district. The five criminals got off at Zhangshan Mouth in Jiangxiang, which is near Tai Lake. It happened that there were two Huangshi boats moored there. The five bandits took their stolen goods and boarded the boats, forcing them to flee towards Xiaoji Mountain. Yao Shangzhi, the captain of the second team of the Tai Lake Water Police Bureau, found out about this. He immediately took the "Kangqing" gunboat and pursued them on the lake near Xiaoji Mountain. He finally caught up with the five bandits. The bandits fired their guns, and the police team responded with machine gun fire. As a result, the five bandits were killed on the spot. The boat owner, Xi Fuxing, was shot three times in his legs and arms, and his son, Xiangnan, was shot in the instep. They were sent to a public hospital for treatment and are not in life-threatening condition. Three of the bandits fell into the center of the lake, and two bandits were found dead on the boat. The stolen money of 5 million yuan and three short guns were found on the boat and sent to Wujin County for verification. The bandit captured in Yaowan was sent to the county government from the Oucang Bridge District Office on the 4th. He was interrogated by Judge Liu Cheng. According to his confession, he was Chen Shizhu, 35 years old, from Wenjiang, Sichuan. He previously served as a platoon leader in the Transportation Company of the 5th Regiment of the 435th Brigade of the 21st Army. He retired in Nanjing in 1945 and transferred to the 23rd Company of the 5th Battalion of the 29th Army Officer Corps for training. He retired in April of this year and went to live in Xiaoshan, Zhejiang. On the 2nd of this month, he arrived in Wuxi and stayed in room 9 of the Zhonghua Hotel. On the morning of the 3rd, he and five classmates, Tang Weiming, Luo Jun, Zhang Jun, and Peng Tianmin, unsuccessfully robbed the Ding Shan scheduled boat. After hearing the confession, Judge Liu Cheng presented it to the county magistrate for review, Xu Shi Chang believed that the bandit was a soldier, committed armed robbery, and the crime was inexcusable. He sentenced him to death in court and sent someone to Zhen on the 5th with the document to present it to the provincial security commander for approval.

### The Origin of British Football (Middle)

— Le Xiurong

In November of the same year (1863), the second meeting was held at the same location. The first president of the Football Association, Arthur Pember, presided, and the first secretary, E.C. Morley, reported that he was working hard to obtain the cooperation of the major schools. He hoped that everyone could adopt the rules of the conference, "so that matches between the clubs can be arranged, because many new clubs are about to be established."

Most of the time in the early stages of the meeting was spent concentrating on and comparing the different rules of the clubs in order to formulate a "football rule" that could be accepted by the public. After heated discussions and arguments, a draft of the rules was successfully completed on November 24, 1863.

The first to express acceptance of this irregular rule was the Royal Engineers Football Club of Jithai, which played a crucial role in the early stages of the British Football Cup.

These rules were not universally accepted. Later, the Cambridge University Football Club offered a set of rules that included many of the key points of football in the simplest way, so there was a need for continued consultation. All thirteen original rules were changed, and on December 1, 1863, the rules of the British-style club were officially produced. This day is a memorable day in the history of the Football Association, from which it could play its role as an organization managing football matches and arranging matches between clubs.

In the early years, there were only friendly matches. Later, there was an obvious need for elimination matches. The British Football Association created and held this historic "British Football Association Challenge Cup" FA．Challenge Cup, (this cup is still held annually in Britain)

### Domestic Cotton Supply Meets Yarn Mill Demand; Shortage of Only 2 Million Bales This Year; Mostly Can Be Obtained Through US Cotton Loans

[Report from our newspaper] An authority in the textile and cotton industry in this city yesterday made an accurate estimate of the current state of raw cotton production and sales and cotton yarn production in our country, regarding the amount of raw cotton needed by our country. According to the talk, it was originally estimated that 6 million bales of ginned cotton could be harvested this cotton season (from September this year to the end of August next year). Due to the impact of military affairs, the estimated actual harvest has been reduced to 5 million bales. Of these 5 million bales, the amount that various factories have already purchased has reached 1.5 million bales. If the current military situation remains unchanged, at least 3.5 million bales can still be collected before the new cotton comes on the market next year, totaling 5 million bales. If 1 million bales of adulteration are further deducted, the estimated actual purchase of ginned cotton in the coming year can reach 4 million bales. If the current military situation progresses well, there is still hope for an increase in the purchase volume.

During this cotton season, the target production of cotton yarn nationwide is 1.8 million pieces of various yarns. Due to power outages and other obstacles, the estimated maximum production this year is about 1.7 million pieces. Based on the need for 400 catties of cotton per piece, the annual total demand for raw cotton is nearly 7 million bales. Compared with the domestic possible supply of 4 million bales of cotton, there is a shortage of about 3 million bales.

For now, the existing cotton stocks of various factories and the United Relief Agency's cotton will all be regarded as cotton stocks and will not be used to offset the shortage. Of the 3 million bales of ginned cotton lacking, 1/10 of the annual yarn and cloth production can be exported, which can be exchanged for 1 million bales of cotton. Therefore, the actual cotton shortage is only about 2 million bales, equivalent to more than 400,000 packages.

According to sources, these 400,000 packages of cotton will mostly be obtained from the nearly mature US cotton loan. Mr. Towson, the Commercial Counselor of the US Embassy, has recently exchanged views with the leaders of the cotton spinning industry in this city to inquire about the types of US cotton needed. As most of the raw cotton that can be purchased in our country today is raw material for 20-count yarn or below, the 400,000 or more packages of foreign cotton will still need to be dominated by fine-staple raw materials. According to experts, roughly 200,000 packages will need to be 7/8's of that time, and 100,000 packages each will need to be one time or more, in order to cooperate with the purchased domestic cotton to meet the needs of the domestic textile industry, it is said.

### Gold Control Bureau to Be Established Next Week; Director Li Talks About Control Principles: "Government and Business Are Both Controlled, Chinese and Foreign Are Treated Equally"

[Report from our newspaper] The newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and Chief of the Audit Office of the Central Bank, Mr. Li Lixia, was previously summoned by the central government and went to Beijing with Deputy Director Bi Delin to discuss various preparations before the establishment of the bureau. He returned to Shanghai after completing the official business yesterday morning. According to him, the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau is scheduled to be formally established and start work within the next week. The bureau will be located on the fourth floor of the Central Bank at No. 24 The Bund. According to the organizational regulations, the bureau will have two offices: Auditing and Secretariat. The Chief Auditor will be concurrently held by the Deputy Director, and the candidate for Chief Secretary has not yet been determined. As for the staffing establishment, it will strive for simplicity, with a maximum of no more than 40 people. All of them will be transferred from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, and no new people will be added. The recurring expenses are very small. He also said that the main mission of the bureau is to increase production and combat speculation in order to stabilize the financial order and stabilize people's livelihoods. As for the control method, the principle of "government and business are both controlled, and Chinese and foreign are treated equally" will be adopted. In other words, all financial institutions, whether commercial or state-run, and whether Chinese or foreign, will be subject to control. Those who violate the regulations will be punished and will not be tolerated. When asked about the contents of the bureau's financial management methods, he said that the Ministry of Finance has now drafted a simple and feasible method for controlling financial business, and the content is very complete. Once it is announced, the bureau will immediately follow it and implement it. Also, before the establishment of the bureau, the financial inspection work in this city will continue to be carried out by the Ministry of Finance in conjunction with the Central Bank, and will not be suspended for a day. After the bureau is established, it will be uniformly managed by the bureau. Finally, Mr. Li said that the work of managing finance is quite difficult, and he deeply hopes that all citizens will assist the bureau in order to achieve complete success.

[Report from our newspaper] The directors of the Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou Gold Control Bureaus of the Ministry of Finance, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, and Gao Fang, are scheduled to leave for Beijing by night train today (7th) to seek instructions from the central government.

### Cotton Yarn Initially Firm then Retreats, New Cloth Purchases Active

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw various parties absorbing at low prices. Subsequently, due to favorable news, both domestic and foreign merchants were active, and external upward pressure was also strong, presenting a firm market. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially traded at 48 million, rising to 49.2 million, but then, due to financial constraints among industry participants, sales were made at high prices, and concerns arose that Fangjian would resume yarn allocation next week, causing sentiment to falter, with many selling, leading to lower prices. By the close, prices had retreated to 48.2 million yuan, an increase of 1.2 million yuan over the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also retreated by 200,000 to 1.1 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market situation saw Fangjian opening sales of fine cloth, all of which were low-grade, and the listed allocation prices were raised, making the market situation quite quiet. With favorable news, new purchases were active, and industry restocking was also brisk, causing prices to rise in circles. By the close, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth had risen to 123 million yuan, rebounding by 30,000 yuan from the previous day, but buying interest remained strong after the close, with external offers rising to 123.8 million yuan with buyers.

Free Talk

### "Spokesperson"

— Jing Wen

In the past, politicians were good at adhering to the maxim "governing is not about talking much," the purpose being "the people can be made to follow, but not to know." On the one hand, this could also be used to "cover up clumsiness" and avoid many troubles.

Now is the democratic era, and the method of "not allowing them to know" is naturally not feasible. To talk about democracy, the first thing is to enlighten the people's wisdom. And to enlighten the people's wisdom, in modern political science terms, is called propaganda. Thus, "spokespersons" of all sizes of institutions were born.

According to psychologists' analysis, people's temperament differs due to different psychological influences (some say it's due to different endocrine secretions), with so-called introversion and extroversion. But whether introverted or extroverted, the desire for fame is the same. The so-called desire for fame, in modern language, is to have others "understand" your merits. "No one below the Three Dynasties did not desire fame," so propaganda, although a product of the democratic era, has been around for a long time.

Since propaganda is not a bad thing, the position of "spokesperson" is of course worthy of respect; whether the words you speak represent yourself or your duties, as long as your words are reasonable, and more importantly, substantive, you have fulfilled the responsibility of "spokesperson."

However, good things often become unrecognizable in the hands of those with ulterior motives. Since the purpose of propaganda is to enlighten the people's wisdom, the first thing is to avoid lying. However, Goebbels, the "spokesperson" of Hitler, who committed suicide by poisoning, once said: "A lie repeated constantly will become the truth." In other words, if you repeat a lie over and over again, people will accept it as a fact.

It is absurd to use propaganda as a tool for lying. However, to deceive the masses temporarily, treating lying as the essence of propaganda may be necessary. However, the Nazis ultimately failed in their large-scale lies to the world.

Getting back to the topic, the inherent meaning of propaganda is indeed beyond reproach, but perhaps because everyone uses this tool too extensively, when seeing some unreliable statements or overly exaggerated advertisements, people always say it's just "propaganda propaganda." The implication is that as soon as something has a propaganda color, it is considered untrustworthy. Isn't this too far from the essence of propaganda?

### Idle Talk about "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" and the Like

— Si Guo

The writing in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" cannot be considered not beautiful, but good structures are only found in intact short stories. However, I once suspected that with Pu Liuxian's such brilliant writing skills, why did he prefer to talk about foxes and ghosts when he could write anything? I didn't find some roots for this until I came into contact with the theory of psychoanalysis. "Strange Tales" and similar works have many psychological backgrounds that can be proposed for research.

First of all, we can imagine that a poor painting enthusiast's curiosity about the opposite sex is no less than that of anyone else. At that time, the Catholic concept of holiness was not yet widespread, and in a situation where society did not value men's chastity and social interaction between men and women was not open, how did scholars accustomed to daydreaming vent their inner distress? This was a very serious matter. Writing about romantic encounters with foxes and ghosts under such circumstances, just as a child cursing someone as a "puppy" is like seeing that person as a puppy, can satisfy the heart a little; although empty, it is also a vent. Therefore, talented people like Pu Liuxian borrowed legends to use the fickle (especially transformed into beautiful women) foxes to solve his emotional distress. Foxes and ghosts gave him the greatest convenience and satisfaction; because they only appeared at night, they would not be seen, and there were no fathers, brothers, or husbands to accuse him of damaging customs and harming families, etc., and committing romantic affairs did not violate the law. It was really the cheapest thing in the world, there was nothing more than this! If an old scholar sees a beautiful (actually not necessarily beautiful, maybe the scholar is nearsighted and can't see clearly) neighbor girl during the day and can't get rid of her when he returns home, writing a few erotic poems is not enough, he can write another ghost story.

From a philosophical point of view, life is inherently painful, and now with ghosts and foxes, pain is no longer to be feared. Just look at how the old can return to youth, the separated can meet immediately, and the lover in one's heart can unite with her unconditionally... and it becomes clear. Since literature allows people freedom of imagination, it naturally cannot refuse people from writing about foxes and ghosts. There are also myths in Western literature, which are partially similar to this.

Since foxes and ghosts are omnipotent, they naturally become knights who steal from the rich to help the poor and eliminate violence and bring peace in this dark society. The popularity of Daoist and martial arts novels stems from the same reason. Furthermore, the Buddhist theory of reincarnation was originally deeply rooted among the people, and scholars who were compassionate or could not stand the corruption of officials and gentry placed infinite hope on ghosts and foxes. To warn bad people, they exaggerated retribution; to vent righteous indignation, they wrote about bad people getting bad results. Regardless of the effect, at least the motive is similar to preaching, which is to supplement what is lacking in the king's transformation. This also shows that Chinese scholars cannot do things actively, but can only passively "persuade people to do good."

There are also difficulties that prevent scholars from doing active things. For example, the Qing Dynasty's suspicion of the Han people made people always want to preserve their lives, and the psychology of avoiding disaster enveloped every scholar. There were many words in their hearts that they wanted to say but could not say happily, so they could only talk about foxes and ghosts. Although the emperor was not happy with those who pointed out the gains and losses of politics or even advocated new things, he sometimes not only did not object to talking about absurd and strange things, but even found it interesting. By the way, it can be said that the old-fashioned scholarship of the Qing Dynasty also achieved great achievements under the psychology of avoiding disaster.

Talking about ghosts and foxes can not only avoid disaster, but also be used to scold people by taking the opportunity. In Western literature, like "Gulliver's Travels," it is satirical, but Ji Xiaolan's tool for scolding Song Confucian scholars was ghosts.

These types of works should spread more easily than cholera because they fit people's tastes. Those who can write want to write, and those who can't write let them. People's talents found an outlet in this type of work, and on the one hand, it was happy and harmless, no wonder there were more people following Pu Liuxian.

### Shop for Sale

— Le

In the classified ads of the New York Herald Tribune, there is an ad in the "Shop for Sale" column that reads: "Supplement Factory for Sale—Products can cure all diseases, with a long-standing reputation, now for sale because the owner is ill."

### Genius

— Li Yuwen

A young mother and her child stood on a street corner, her hand pointing from the child's shoulder to a man sitting in a car, saying, "This is Albert Einstein, don't forget, you have seen him."

She pointed out a short, stout little man with a dignified face and a thick head of white hair. He is the well-known contemporary great scientist, the inventor of relativity, the father of the atomic age, and also a humorous, friendly, frank, humble, and simple person.

There are many stories about Einstein, here are a few of them, from which it can be fully explained why Einstein has been praised by people for so long.

Einstein's home in Princeton is a simple two-story house, but it was once equipped with an elevator. A friend heard that this stupid business had actually succeeded, and went to ask him: "Good heavens, Abe, why did you install an elevator?"

"I don't know either," Einstein replied, "It's just that the business-grabbing gentleman was so kind that I couldn't refuse!"

Einstein's neighbor had a little girl who became very friendly with the great mathematician. She went to see him almost every afternoon. The little girl's mother felt strange and ran to ask the professor what they were talking about.

"Oh," Einstein replied, "She gives me cakes to eat every day, and she asks me to do her arithmetic homework for her."

Once, when Einstein was invited to meet the Belgian royal family, the welcoming party went to the train station to greet him. Cars and drivers were prepared, and servants were sorting luggage, but they couldn't find Einstein. It turned out that he had quietly walked off the train, carrying his suitcase, and walking to the palace.

Einstein explained to these surprised people very simply, saying, "I like to walk."

### Integrity

— Wang Baili

The Biography of Xue Xuan in the History of Ming Dynasty states: Xuan was promoted to censor after passing the imperial examination. The Three Yangs (Yang Rong, Yang Shiqi, and Yang Pu were all Grand Secretaries at the time, historically known as the Three Yangs) wanted to meet him, Xuan said: "I am in charge of impeachment, it is righteous not to know each other." He refused to meet. The Three Yangs praised him endlessly, saying, "Even seeing Master Xue is impossible, let alone be submissive to him?" With the prestige of a prime minister, wanting to condescend to meet a censor, in the eyes of ordinary people, would be considered the highest honor, but Master Xue was afraid that after meeting, it would be difficult to avoid developing feelings. With feelings, it would be difficult to impeach. So, he simply refused to meet, so as to avoid the dilemma of being in a difficult position in case of impeachment in the future. His strictness was such that later generations of historians could not help but admire him. Also, the Notes from Willow South Record: When Zhou Xiangguo Yushou from Yixing was young, he studied with Mr. Huang Jiezi. Mr. Huang praised him extremely. When Yushou later lived in the village after passing the high-level imperial examination, he was quite unbridled. Mr. Huang heard of this and was not happy. Later, Yushou went to visit Mr. Huang for something. Mr. Huang firmly lay in bed and refused to get up. When he knelt in front of the bed to beg forgiveness, Mr. Huang suddenly got up and slapped his cheek, saying, "You have just obtained your teeth, and you are already harming the village!" His strictness was comparable to Master Xue's refusal to meet the Three Yangs. I say that this is not only the upright spirit of Master Xue and Master Huang that fills the four poles, but also the praise of the Three Yangs and Zhou's willingness to endure pain are enough to be examples for future generations. As for Chen Ziqiang of the Song Dynasty, who was originally the teacher of Han Tuozhou, when Tuozhou became noble, Ziqiang relied on him, even calling him "Benefactor King" and "Benefactor Father." One called him without knowing shame, and the other responded without a sense of shame. His meanness and vulgarity made people vomit for three days. Compared to the two above-mentioned gentlemen, can they not be ashamed to death!

### Random Notes on Inspecting a Pavilion: The Weng-Li Feud in Late Qing Political Strife (Part 1)

— Yu Shou

In the forty years before the Qing Dynasty's demise, because the Manchus were mostly foolish and ignorant of affairs, Han officials gradually gained power. "Those who eat from the same trough will inevitably bite each other," so party strife was unavoidable. One of the most famous examples was the Weng-Li feud during the mid-Guangxu period.

Weng refers to Weng Tonghe from Changshu, and Li refers to Li Hongzao from Gaoyang (father of the current Central Committee member Li Yuying). At that time, both were in the Grand Council, and both were known for their ability to nurture talent and their strong fighting spirit. These figures each held a political and literary position in the following decades and were known as the "Qingliu" (pure stream). A list is provided below:

Gaoyang Faction:

Zhang Youqiao (Peilun)

Zhang Xiangtao (Zhidong)

Chen Tao'an (Baochen)

Huang Shulan (Tifang)

Changshu Faction:

Sheng Boyi (Yu)

Wang Kezhuang (Renkan)

Shen Zipei (Qiuzhi)

Zhang Lizhi (Yu)

Wen Yunge (Tingshi)

Changshu entered the Grand Council later than Gaoyang (in the eighth year of Guangxu). At that time, the Manchu Prince Bingzheng relied on Gaoyang for support. However, the Empress Dowager Cixi's perception of Prince Gong had changed. Changshu, knowing this hidden sentiment, directed his cultivated scholars to first attack Gaoyang, and then Prince Gong. The initiator was Sheng Boyi, known as the "Master of the Huage Pavilion" from the imperial clan. As a result, Prince Gong and his "hem ha generals" Baojun and Li Hongzao were all dismissed from the Grand Council overnight (Weng was also removed from the Grand Council at the same time), falling into disgrace for ten years without being able to rise again. At the time, many suspected this was a plot by Prince Chun, and that Changshu was allied with Prince Chun, thus not hesitating to grab chestnuts from the fire. In reality, Prince Gong and Li's removal was due to the Empress Dowager Cixi's personal emotional changes. Changshu's attack succeeded simply because it coincided with the opportunity. The Empress Dowager certainly did not favor the Changshu faction. Looking at the following ten years, there was no significant advancement or retreat for either faction in terms of personnel. Moreover, Zhang Youqiao was appointed to handle Fujian coastal defense affairs in the same year, not shrinking back because of Gaoyang's downfall (the defeat in the Battle of Mawei and the subsequent reprimand occurred a year later).

However, later, individuals from both factions attacked each other in their diaries and manuscripts. The vulgarity of their language was akin to that of street thugs (which will be excerpted below), fully exposing the narrow-mindedness, obstinacy, and other bad habits of the old Chinese scholar-official class. Even the wise Cangqu Old Man (Chen Tao'an), in his "Four Poems on Spring," slandered Changshu without leaving any room for reconciliation. Reading it fifty years later, one seems to still hear his yelping.

In the twentieth year of Guangxu, both Prince Gong and Gaoyang rose again. At that time, Guangxu gradually began to manage affairs, and Changshu was able to stay in office. However, Prince Gong and Gaoyang had been frustrated for many years and had lost their sharp spirit, unable to seek revenge. Weng Changshu wrote in his diary on November 1, year 22 of Guangxu, "Prince Gong requested a reward for Li, but it was not granted. After Gaoyang's illness, walking is extremely difficult. Today, when entering the audience, he had to be supported and still could not stand steadily. It is worrying." His words contained a hint of mockery. This was 1896 in the Gregorian calendar (Gaoyang died half a year later). At that time, Li Shizeng may still have been tying a red velvet braid and reciting "guan guan ju jiu" at home.

### Talking About Toothaches

— Guangjue

Recently, my teeth have been hurting again, as if I'm back in my childhood.

When I was little, I loved to eat sugary treats. My mother didn't know how to teach me oral hygiene, and my teeth were riddled with cavities. I knew that there were two sets of teeth, and at first, I thought that if the first set was ruined, the second set would definitely be good. I didn't expect that if the first set was bad, the second set would also be bad.

When I was losing my teeth, I always ran to my grandfather, who practiced Chinese medicine. As soon as I opened my mouth to him, he knew what I wanted. He would take a look, know which one needed to be pulled, stick two fingers in, grab the ruined tooth, and tell me to "qiang!" I would say "qiang!" and the ruined tooth would be in my grandfather's hand. He would always ask, "It doesn't hurt at all, right?" Actually, it hurt a little, but I always said it didn't hurt at all. Then, my grandmother would tell me to throw the upper teeth that were pulled out under the rice husk, and throw the lower teeth that were pulled out onto the eaves. It was as if this would ensure that the new teeth that came out later would be perfect, but it just didn't work.

By the time I was ten or so, toothaches had become a chronic problem. When it hurt, my mother would only give me a raw egg and tell me to roll it on my face. Twenty years ago, it seems that even aspirin, which treated headaches for head pain and toothaches for tooth pain, hadn't reached our countryside. Sometimes, they told me to put a small Japanese "Jintan" pill in the cavity. It was fine at first, but after a while, it hurt even more.

In university, it started hurting again. This time, of course, I had to consult some dental doctor who had studied in Germany or Japan. One doctor examined me and said it would cost ten silver dollars to pull one and fill one, and I agreed. This young doctor pulled a slightly decayed but strong old tooth, which I still resent to this day. When he pulled it, he broke out in a sweat, mobilized his friend who shared the consulting room with him, and the female nurses all looked at each other in dismay. I lost too much blood and almost fainted in front of my classmates when I got back to school. The false tooth he fitted for me was clamped between two teeth, and it was very unstable. I simply threw it away, which caused my upper teeth to loosen up one by one, as if they were lining up and looking to the right. They weren't very good-looking to begin with, and now they were even less so. However, in any case, the doctor extracted the nerve and filled one tooth with silver amalgam, which he said would last for three years. In fact, it's been fourteen or fifteen years now, and it still hasn't decayed.

### Xiaoyao Flower (Free and Easy Flower)

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 2: A Gentle Chat (7)

Master Zhu treats me so well, just like his own daughter. He tells me everything he knows and always reminds me of my mistakes. At that time, my father formed his own troupe, and the troupe lacked a second female role. Many people suggested that I take on the role, but my father refused. Only after Mr. Zhu and Mr. Xu strongly recommended me did he agree to let me try. I remember one evening, my father's play was "The Battle of Taiping," and there were over eight hundred people in the audience. My father was very happy. My play that day was "Wu Jia Po," which was scheduled as the finale. When "Wu Jia Po" finished and "The Battle of Taiping" had just started, one-third of the audience left. My father then realized why the audience was so enthusiastic and said with great emotion, "Old plays are not popular these days. I never thought that a girl could attract such a crowd!" From then on, he told me to focus on learning the plays diligently. Under the guidance of Mr. Zhu and Mr. Xu, I learned all of Mei Lanfang's plays, including "The Tale of Taizhen," "Life and Death Regret," and "The Goddess of Luo." Seeing my progress, my father had high expectations for me. At that time, Zhang Xiaojuan came to Beijing from Shanghai to perform. The second female role she brought, Ma Yanyun, fell ill. Xiaojuan asked Xu Guifen to find her a replacement. Because Xiaojuan was Mr. Xu's favorite student, Mr. Xu thought of me. He asked Master Zhu to talk to me, asking me to cooperate with Xiaojuan and help out for two weeks. I thought that Mr. Xu had treated me very well, and he always taught me plays without asking for anything in return. I couldn't refuse this favor. Moreover, cooperating with Xiaojuan would give me more experience, which would be very beneficial to me. So, I told my father, and he agreed very readily.

A few days later, he heard something from someone and said to me, "This play must not be performed. Someone is trying to sabotage our Gu Family Troupe." Because I had already agreed to Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu, and they had already made arrangements, I couldn't go back on my word. I repeatedly stated that cooperating with Xiaojuan would not conflict with the Gu Family Troupe at all, because people who watched kunqu (female role) plays were a different crowd. My father didn't agree with this and scolded me, smashed a lot of things, and in a fit of anger, canceled the play that was posted at the Jixiang Theater. He also announced that the Gu Family Troupe would be disbanded from now on. At that time, I was supposed to cooperate with Xiaojuan in the play "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and the playbill had already been posted at the Guangde Building. How could I tell Mr. Xu this? I was so anxious and felt so embarrassed. Later, I asked my father's good friend, Wang Shoushan, to explain to my father again and again. My father only allowed me to perform one show with Xiaojuan on the first day, and not to perform again after that. On the morning of the first day of the performance, Xiaojuan invited me and my brother to have lunch together at Tonghe Restaurant to strengthen our friendship. Unexpectedly, my brother saw Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu present and expressed his dissatisfaction to them. Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu then realized that because I was performing with Xiaojuan, my family had been in turmoil. My brother's words implied that he blamed Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu for ruining the relationship between my father and me. Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhu didn't say anything at the time. After the joint performance that evening, Master Zhu said to me the next day, "There are a lot of rumors outside, so it's not convenient for us to teach you plays anymore. You should find another teacher."

Can we abandon them? Please continue to report on their situation; Please publish articles urging the government to come up with a solution for them; Please hold a fundraising campaign for them. Although I am extremely poor, I am willing to cut back on food and clothing to donate. We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and I believe there are many sympathetic people. Your newspaper has been striving for 75 years, and you gentlemen have never lagged behind in public welfare and charitable causes. I hope you will accept this request from a reader. I believe this is more meaningful than the daily news about Xiao Danggui in various newspapers. Sincerely, A Reader To the editors of Shen Bao
