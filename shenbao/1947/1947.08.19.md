### Establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee; Market Prices to be Determined Daily; US Dollar Opens at 39,500 Yuan Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee convened its inaugural meeting at the Central Bank in this city yesterday at 11:00 AM. Chairman Chen Huide remained in Qingdao and did not return, so Zhang Jia'ao served as acting chairman. Committee members Xu Baiyuan, Shen Xirui, and representatives from designated banks, including the heads of China Bank, Bank of Communications, Citibank, and HSBC, attended. After discussions, based on the recommendations of the designated banks, the committee approved the exchange rate (Covering Rate) between the designated banks and the committee for US and British currencies at 39,000 yuan. The forward US dollar rate will increase by 4% per month. The arbitrage rate for pounds against US dollars will be calculated at US$3.20 per pound. Exchange rates for other currencies will be calculated proportionally by the designated banks and submitted to the committee for approval.

Around 12:00 PM yesterday, the designated banks, based on the exchange rates approved by the committee, announced buying and selling rates for US and British currencies. The spot US dollar buying rate was 38,500 yuan, and the selling rate was 39,500 yuan. The spot British pound buying rate was 122,800 yuan, and the selling rate was 126,800 yuan. However, since the opening rates were announced close to noon and the new measures were just being implemented, there was still much misunderstanding. Although many people inquired about the rates from the designated banks and foreign exchange brokers, there were few formal transactions.

Starting today, every day at 9:00 AM, representatives from the designated banks, including the heads of China Bank, Bank of Communications, Citibank, and HSBC, will assess the foreign exchange market conditions, collectively discuss a suitable exchange rate, submit it to the committee for approval, and then notify all designated banks to follow the rate, opening for trading at 9:30 AM and closing at 12:00 PM. Trading will be limited to two and a half hours in the morning each day, with no afternoon session, allowing the designated banks and the committee to reconcile and settle the day's transactions.

### Designated Banks and Brokers to Reapply for Approval

To strictly limit the number of designated banks and foreign exchange brokers, the authorities have reportedly decided that they must reapply for approval starting today. The number of approved firms will be fewer than the current number. However, before the new list of approved firms is announced, the originally designated and approved banks and brokers are still permitted to continue their legal foreign exchange trading business.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao and Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan convened a meeting at the Central Bank yesterday at 10:00 AM with 29 designated Chinese and foreign banks in the city. Over 30 representatives from the banks attended. After explaining the key points of the new exchange settlement measures, Zhang and Xu, on behalf of the government, expressed three hopes to the designated banks: (1) that the banks would sincerely cooperate with the Central Bank to support the new foreign exchange policies; (2) that the banks would strictly adhere to the new management measures promulgated by the government when buying and selling foreign exchange; and (3) that the qualifications of the designated banks would be re-evaluated, and the banks should reapply for approval. The two officials then stated that the government's prerequisites for reviewing the qualifications of designated banks were: (1) based on the banks' past history and credit in foreign exchange business; (2) the banks' past performance in assisting the Central Bank's foreign exchange business (such as encouraging remittances from overseas Chinese); and (3) whether the banks can strictly comply with government laws and regulations when engaging in foreign exchange trading. On behalf of the designated banks, Chen Changtong, chairman of the Designated Banks Association, responded, expressing their determination to support the new measures promulgated by the government and their willingness to comply with them. The meeting adjourned around 11:00 AM.

### National Banks and Bureaus Continue to Adopt Tight Lending Policies; Vice Minister Xu Explains the Scope of Exchange Settlement

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to coordinate the lending policies of national banks and bureaus with the government's revised exchange settlement measures, Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan convened a meeting with the heads of various national banks and bureaus at the conference room of the Joint Treasury Agency in this city yesterday at 5:00 PM. Xu instructed that the lending of each national bank and bureau should adhere to the following four principles: (1) Lending policies should be re-adjusted to align with the new foreign exchange policies; (2) Lending principles should generally continue to adopt a tight policy; (3) Lending that is first lent and then reported by the banks and bureaus themselves must be strictly limited; (4) Industrial loans should, as far as possible, adopt the method of order-based lending in the future.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan held a reception for the local press at the Central Bank yesterday at 4:00 PM to report on the establishment of the Stabilization Fund Committee and the listing of commercial foreign exchange rates, and answered questions raised by reporters. The details are as follows:

(1) This time, the government has revised the exchange settlement measures, stipulating that designated banks can only settle and sell foreign exchange within the following scope: A. Imported materials with permits; B. Non-quota items approved for import; C. Foreign exchange required for legitimate purposes approved by the government. Therefore, in theory and according to law, there should no longer be a black market. However, the effective implementation of the new exchange settlement measures cannot solely rely on the Central Bank, the Import and Export Management Committee, or the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, but also requires close coordination with customs anti-smuggling and economic inspection efforts. On the one hand, it is still necessary to actively crack down on the circulation and trading of gold and US dollars. On the other hand, it is still necessary to eradicate speculation and hoarding and practice frugality in consumption. Then, the implementation of the entire policy will surely achieve the greatest effect.

(2) The funds of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee are very ample. The entire fund is allocated by the Central Bank. The committee will approve the daily foreign exchange settlement rates based on the recommendations of representatives from the designated banks and will convene meetings at any time, taking into account the foreign exchange market conditions.

(3) Since the revision of the exchange settlement measures, it is believed that exports will gradually increase in the future. Lou Tongsun's estimates of China's balance of international payments published yesterday are quite accurate. However, it is not surprising that China recovers US$200 million in foreign exchange annually due to exports. Taking only the export of soybeans from Northeast China as an example, before the war, annual exports could reach 1.5 million tons, which, at US$175 per ton, amounts to US$262.5 million. However, at present, domestic demand for imports is urgent, and exports cannot keep pace, or it is not easy to balance payments for a time, so it still requires the people of the country to advocate frugality in consumption.

(4) After the revision of the exchange settlement measures, according to Article 3 of the Import and Export Trade Regulations, the Import and Export Committee may take necessary measures to regulate and assist the development of export trade. Therefore, China's exported materials will not be massively dumped abroad due to favorable export prices.

(5) The government has now stipulated five types of imported goods that can be settled at the official rate. Although most of them are agricultural products, the import of these agricultural products is all to supplement what domestic goods cannot provide. It will definitely not affect the prices of domestic agricultural products. Also, these five types of imported goods that can be settled at the official rate are not immutable and will be temporarily approved by the Import and Export Committee at any time based on actual conditions.

(6) Order-based loans for daily necessities for people's livelihoods have reached a mature stage after the Joint Treasury Agency consulted the opinions of relevant agencies and will soon be implemented. However, the items of materials for which loans are provided will be slightly reduced from the originally planned eight types.

### Central Bank Branches in Nanjing and Beiping Did Not Post Foreign Exchange Rates

Because They Had Not Yet Received Orders from the Head Office

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Nanjing Central Bank did not receive orders from the head office on the 18th, so how the foreign exchange market price was, the branch did not post a rate on the 18th. According to the person in charge of the bank: this matter should be handled after the head office issues an order.

[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch, 18th] The Beiping branch of the Central Bank did not post foreign exchange rates on the 18th, but the Upper Treasury Certificates had already received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend sales to prevent people from rushing to buy and take advantage of price fluctuations during the exchange rate changes. According to the person in charge of the Beiping branch of the Central Bank: "The posting of foreign exchange rates in major cities such as Nanjing, Hong Kong, Beiping, and Tianjin on the morning of the 18th, this bank has not yet received an order for." After the announcement of the revised foreign exchange management measures, the gold and US dollar markets in Beiping fluctuated greatly yesterday, but today they have stabilized. The black market price of US dollars today is below 40,000, grain prices are slightly higher, and the yarn market has declined. Beiping's merchants are extremely optimistic about the new foreign exchange measures. The Merchants Association convened a plenary meeting to review countermeasures, which did not end until late in the evening. In the past, the amount of foreign exchange they were allocated was extremely small, and the difference between the official foreign exchange rate and the black market rate was very large, so import trade had been stagnating for a long time. Now it is heard that the entire foreign exchange management method has changed, and the obstacles to exports have been eliminated, and imports will prosper. Economists Zhao Naibo and Yang Ximeng are maintaining a cautious judgment on the effect of the second trump card of Zhang Jia'ao's appointment. The two are quite concerned about whether the two foreign exchange prices can coexist and how to make the use and distribution of the official price fair and appropriate.

### Import and Export Management Committee to be Established This Afternoon

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Import and Export Management Committee is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Central Bank this afternoon at 5:00 PM. The list of committee members announced yesterday is still missing one member, Zhang Fuyun. The total number of committee members is eleven.

### Revision of Exchange Rates and Strengthening of Investigations Will Greatly Reduce Smuggling; Deputy Director Zhu Discusses Customs Administration Measures

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Zhu Xie, Deputy Director of Customs Administration, said on the 18th that due to the revision of foreign exchange measures and the strengthening of anti-smuggling work, smuggling will inevitably decrease day by day in the future. It is said that the main reason why smuggling was so rampant in South China in the past was actually due to the foreign exchange controls being too rigid. Regarding export trade, in the past, exporters had to settle foreign exchange at the official rate, and the difference between the official rate and the black market price was too large. Forcing exporters to settle foreign exchange at the official rate was tantamount to bankrupting them. In order to avoid excessive losses, exporters caused a large amount of smuggling. Regarding import smuggling, in the past, overseas remittances were required to be settled at the official rate. In order to reduce losses caused by settling foreign exchange at the official rate, overseas Chinese remitted higher amounts and smuggled in luxury goods that were easier to carry. Now that the foreign exchange management measures have been revised and foreign exchange is allowed to be sold to designated banks at market prices, the basic reasons for the above-mentioned import and export smuggling have been eliminated, and smuggling incidents can be expected to be greatly reduced. As for how to prevent technical problems of smuggling? The customs authorities are taking the following effective measures: (1) Establish strongholds and branch customs offices in Hong Kong and Macao to strengthen investigations. (2) Strengthen the anti-smuggling force and its equipment, A. Increase anti-smuggling personnel and pay attention to their qualitative improvement. B. The 200 anti-smuggling personnel trained in Chongqing have been transferred to work in South China and strengthen the anti-smuggling force, increase patrol boats, and equip heavy weapons. C: Ask for the assistance of relevant parties in anti-smuggling. (3) Carry out distant sea patrols. (4) Borrow naval vessels and station them outside the Pearl River Estuary to investigate and suppress armed smuggling. Zhu also said: After the above-mentioned measures are adopted, the smuggling will be impossible, so the smuggling merchants changed and used special forces to individual, but organized smuggling, the marine country is now stepping up investigations, in addition to the revision of foreign exchange measures, smuggling is almost unprofitable, so the smuggling incidents decrease in the future, is a matter of course.

### Overseas Chinese in the United States Can Deposit Remittances in US Dollar Accounts in Banks

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] When discussing the revision of foreign exchange management measures, the authorities paid special attention to overseas remittances and tried to provide special convenience. It is heard that overseas Chinese in the United States can remit funds back to the country in US dollars, and after being remitted back to their homeland, they can also deposit them in US dollar accounts in banks.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Zhou Yongneng, Deputy Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (formerly the chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance), told this newspaper's visiting reporter on the 18th that after the promulgation of the new foreign exchange management measures, the phenomenon of overseas remittances evading controls can be reduced. In the past, because the black market was much higher than the official price, overseas Chinese suffered huge losses when remitting funds back to the country, so they evaded controls or brought materials, especially luxury goods that were not daily necessities, back to the country. Overseas Chinese have always been patriotic and never lagged behind, and the evasion of overseas remittances was purely a last resort, for which the people of the country can understand. Zhou continued: Before the War of Resistance, overseas remittances amounted to about US$300 million annually. After the promulgation of the new measures, overseas remittances are expected to exceed this number, for the following reasons: (1) During the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese remittances could not be remitted back due to inconvenient transportation. Now it is much more convenient than in the past, and the numbers can be expected to increase. (2) During the War of Resistance, the hometowns of overseas Chinese, such as Guangzhou and Chaozhou, were also occupied by the enemy, so some remittances could not be remitted back. (3) Overseas Chinese in the United States and Australia had quite prosperous businesses during the war, and all of this can be remitted back. (4) The price of the national currency is lower than that of foreign currencies, and overseas Chinese can earn a considerable amount of money after the funds are remitted to their hometowns, which is also a reason to stimulate overseas Chinese remittances. The reporter asked what effective steps the authorities will take in the future to facilitate overseas remittances and attract overseas capital to engage in domestic construction? Zhou replied: The remittance procedure is a technical issue, and it should be improved in the future. As for attracting overseas capital, the authorities have long had this intention and have established institutions such as the "Overseas Chinese Production and Construction Association." In the future, it will be carried out in accordance with the principles and regulations of the economic reform plan, and I hope that the society can assist the government in jointly planning and implementing it.

### The Wedemeyer Mission Works Intensively, Presiding Over Meetings All Day Long

Reviewing the Information Obtained Again

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The US Embassy announced that Wedemeyer met with Minister of Communications Yu Dawei once on the 18th. The rest of the time was busy with continuous meetings to review the information collected during the Wedemeyer Mission's stay in China. In the coming week, every second of Wedemeyer's working hours has been fully scheduled. Except for a very small number of banquets and talks, there is no opportunity to make more meetings. Other members of the delegation continued their individual activities, seeking additional information.

### The Mission Issues a Statement, Willing to Hear the Opinions of the Communist Party

But Not Waiting for This to Complete the Work

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The US Embassy published the following statement by the Wedemeyer Mission on the afternoon of the 18th: "During the Wedemeyer Mission's stay in China, its members have emphasized that they are now willing to receive oral or written information from any individual or group. The mission has been asked many times whether it is willing to obtain information from the Chinese Communist Party, and the answer each time has been an unwavering affirmation. In the effort to seek opposing opinions, the mission has been and is happy to receive information from the CCP. In fact, extremely contradictory opinions have been obtained and are being carefully considered." According to news consultant Watson, this statement is only a general answer to inquiries from all parties and does not mean that the mission is waiting for information from a specific source to complete its work, and it is also not related to Wedemeyer's talks with Vice Chairman Sun that the information obtained "was not very satisfactory." China is a large country with a large population, and it is almost impossible for a group of a dozen people to collect all the detailed information in three or four weeks. The information currently obtained by the mission is enough to help it understand the problem, determine the facts, and analyze the data. The next step is to draft the final report. The last part of the final report will be completed after returning to the United States. The mission will issue a written statement again before leaving China.

### Businessmen Welcome Foreign Exchange Management Measures

[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] Although the press here has not yet commented on the new foreign exchange policy of our government, which stipulates that importers and exporters can purchase foreign exchange in the open market, the initial reaction is to agree. All sectors of the United States have not expressed their opinions on China's new regulations, but after contacting American business people, the impression is that all news that relaxes controls is welcomed by Americans, because Americans have always hated controls, especially those on business matters. American businessmen that the reporter contacted all hope that the new policy can readjust import licenses, because they believe that the current system is quite unfair.

### American Businessmen Gather in Tokyo

### National Army Reunites at Zhoucun on the Jiaoji Railway, Zichuan Recaptured, Advancing on Boshan, Troops in Eastern Henan Recapture Zhecheng, Luyi, and Taikang

[Report from our Newspaper, Jinan, 18th] The Guandong Line recovered Zichuan at 5 PM on the 18th and is advancing towards Duxiang Mountain.

[Report from our Newspaper, Jinan, 18th] The western central route army of the Jiaoji Line recovered Wangcun Changshan on the morning of the 18th and completed its reunion near Zhoucun at 3 PM in the afternoon. The eastern route National Army is continuing its advance from Gaomi.

[Report from our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th] The Xuzhou Command of the Army Headquarters announced that the situation in Shandong Province has entered a pacification phase. In the past month, the National Army in central and western Shandong has achieved remarkable results, recovering more than a hundred important towns and cities, annihilating over 97,000 communist bandits including the commander of the Communist troops, and seizing over 1,100 heavy machine guns and over 42,000 rifles of various sizes.

[Report from our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th] The situation in eastern Henan has taken a sharp turn for the better. The National Army recaptured Zhucheng County on the 17th, and Luyi and Taikang on the 18th. The National Army is advancing from both the north and east to encircle and suppress the remnants of Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 7th columns of communist bandits, who are fleeing westward from Xihua and Fugou. These communist bandits are trapped in an encirclement and will likely not escape. Furthermore, the remnants in the Ningling, Guoyang, and Zhecheng areas south of the Longhai Railway have been completely cleared.

[Report from our Newspaper, Bengbu, 18th] Of the five columns of Liu Bocheng's troops that retreated south of the Longhai Railway, only about 50,000 to 60,000 remain. After being pursued by the National Army, a portion of them converged with Wei Fenglou's troops on the border of Anhui and Henan and are heading north along the Guo River. The National Army is determined to strike them head-on.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th] The situation in the Central Plains bandit suppression has undergone a new change. The 1st, 6th, and 7th columns of the communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops, who were roaming the old Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan and northern Anhui, may join forces with the local bandit Wei Fenglou's troops and head towards the Dabie Mountains or the Tongbai Mountains to prolong their survival under the four-sided encirclement of the National Army. This can be proven by the following facts: First, the National Army found an order issued by the bandit chief Liu Bocheng next to the body of a certain important bandit leader, revealing that the Dabie Mountains or the Tongbai Mountains are the last resort, and ordering each column to allocate more maps of the Dabie Mountains or the Tongbai Mountains; Second, the Liu bandits who were surrounded in the old Yellow River flood area of eastern Henan and northern Anhui, have repeatedly attacked Manci Township south of Shangqiu and the borders of Fugou and Yanling in recent days, making false feints towards the outer perimeter of Xuzhou, Bianliang, and Zhengzhou, but they were defeated and retreated. The main force is now concentrated in Huaiyang, gathering in Hao County, Zhecheng, and Qi County, and are beginning to flee towards the northeast foothills of the Dabie Mountains; Third, the only two brigades and the ninth division of the third column of the Liu bandits, which were abandoned north of the Longhai Railway, have now been reorganized into a new independent column, also known as the new Fourth Column, joining forces with the remnants of the Eighth Column of the Communist bandit East China Field Army in the area of Liangdatou in southeastern Cao County, and are scattered in four small groups in the north and south of Yuncheng and the southeast of Heze, disrupting transportation and hindering the southward pursuit of the National Army in western Shandong, in order to benefit the main force of the Liu bandits south of the Longhai. [Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th] The previously interrupted four sections of the Longhai Railway between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou for passenger and freight transport will resume on the 18th.

[Report from our Newspaper, Changchun, 18th] According to information received by the military, seventeen trains of Korean communist bandits arrived in Harbin on the 2nd and 3rd of this month. In addition, three Soviet ships arrived in Harbin on the 4th, fully loaded with over a thousand boxes of military supplies, over thirty cannons, and many light and heavy machine guns. This is part of the foreign aid received before the communist army launched its sixth offensive. According to news from refugee groups in Songbei: The bandit area has recently released nearly 30,000 people, who are being transferred from Songbei to Weiyuan and are currently en route. This matter is particularly noteworthy, as it undoubtedly exacerbates the government's difficulties. Moreover, the communist bandits previously had a large number of refugees cross south before the fifth offensive, which can be considered a sharp political offensive before a military offensive.

### Intense Fighting Erupts in the Jilin-Changchun Area

### The China Changchun Railway is Actively Being Repaired

The Changchun-Shenyang section is expected to be open to traffic by the end of next month

[Report from our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] Chen Cheng has ordered the Changchun-Shenyang section of the China Changchun Railway to be open to traffic within forty days. Railway workers and civilians are working together to repair it. The only difficulty is the lack of materials and transportation. 120,000 railway ties are needed, and efforts are being made to supplement them from Jilin and within the passes. Another 260 vehicles are being prepared to transport equipment. Trains are currently running between Shenyang and Kaiyuan. The biggest obstacle past Kaiyuan is the Qinghe Great Iron Bridge, where 30% of the repair work has been completed. Traffic between Shenyang and Siping is expected to resume in late October. The opening of the Changchun-Shenyang section will depend on the arrival of the railway ties at the construction site, otherwise it will have to be postponed.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] The Changchun City Reporters Corps took a special plane this morning with Mu Guifang, the director of the Changchun Management Office of the China Changchun Railway, to Fanjiazhuang along the railway to inspect the repair situation of the Changchun-Shenyang section of the railway, and returned to Changchun at noon. The impression of the work spirit of the repair personnel was extremely good. The 40,000 railway ties purchased in Jilin by the China Changchun Railway are now being transported south one after another. The damaged mileage reaches a total of 147 kilometers, and it is currently being repaired in four groups in sections. According to Mu's estimation, if the materials can be delivered as scheduled, the traffic between Changchun and Jinzhou may be restored before the end of September.

### The Newly Appointed Xinjiang Commissioner, Ma Liangjun, Issues a Statement, Hoping to Reconcile the Various Divisions

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 18th] The newly appointed Xinjiang Commissioner Ma Liangjun stated to reporters today: The situation in Xinjiang Province is slightly different from that in the interior. Therefore, in carrying out the supervisory task, one should adapt to local conditions in the near future, act according to the situation, and then promote the work, so as to both reconcile the various divisions and not fail the country's entrustment. The reporter met this eighty-year-old Hui religious leader in the famous Shaanxi Great Mosque in Dihua. Mr. Ma first humbly stated: "I am a devout religious believer who has dedicated my life to studying religion and engaging in education. I have no administrative experience. I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to fulfill my responsibilities, but I will still try to do my best to serve the country, the people, and the local area." Mr. Ma made the aforementioned statement after casually discussing his life and religious experiences with the reporter for forty minutes. His profound knowledge and kind demeanor left a deep impression on the reporter. Commissioner Ma is eighty years old this year and was born in Tianshui, Gansu in the seventh year of Tongzhi. In his youth, he studied in Chang'an and traveled with Ma Renshan of Yunfu Puer, a contemporary sage of the Holy Gate, and inherited his mantle. In the 28th year of Guangxu, he entered Xinjiang to lecture, and his footprints spread throughout the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. He has dedicated his life to revitalizing the religious community, sorting out various schools of thought, integrating them, and transforming them into one. He is proficient in Arabic and Persian and has studied the doctrines of the Near East in particular. He has written many books, including "A Clear Record of Religious Essentials," "Historical Investigation of the Hui People," and "Xiliangli Sutra" (i.e., astronomy), and is a brilliant Sai Dian in the Chinese Muslim community. His recent book on the history of Islam, which advocates peaceful war theory, was particularly admired by Director Zhang Zhizhong. His appointment as Xinjiang Commissioner this time is due to the deep impression that Mr. Ma's past achievements have planted in the hearts of the people throughout Xinjiang. It is no surprise that he has received enthusiastic love from all sides.

### Communist Bandits in Hebei Province Destroy Roads, National Army Intensifies Sweeping

[Report from our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Recently, communist bandits have been destroying railways more frequently. Last night, a section between Yongle and Liulihe on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway was destroyed and repaired at 1 PM this afternoon. There have been no accidents between Beiping and Baoding until the 20th, and traffic can be formally restored. Communist bandit activity has intensified in the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway, and the National Army has increased defenses today. The National Army in Qing County in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway resumed sweeping operations yesterday, and preparations are still underway to open the entire Jinpu line. The Beiping-Chengde line has been repaired, and the Beiping-Tianjin Railway Bureau is actively preparing, but there is a shortage of steel rails, and the Ministry has been requested to allocate them. The section between Shixia and Gubeikou within the passes is short and easier, but the 106 kilometers from Gubeikou to Chengde have more than twenty tunnels and two large bridges, making the project larger. If there is no shortage of materials on the entire line, it can be completed in two months.

### The Ming Tombs in Changping County Are Severely Damaged, Only Changling Survives

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] The Ming Tombs in Changping County, north of Beiping, have been devastated by successive enemy puppets and communist bandits for the past ten years. They were finally returned to the control of the National Army in the recent Northern Hebei Sweeping Campaign. The reporter followed Liang Jiaqi, a special commissioner of the Fifth District of Hebei, yesterday to inspect the tombs for several hours, allowing him to see the grandeur of our ancient architecture. The Ming Tombs are located about twenty li north of the county seat, with a car road leading directly to them. Bridges and roadbeds along the way have occasionally been destroyed by communist bandits, but they do not hinder traffic. The stone archway in front of Changling can be seen from several miles away. Stone figures and horses are lined up on both sides of the road, winding for several miles, and the carvings are extremely detailed and vivid. Changling is the only tomb that has escaped destruction. The other twelve tombs have been severely damaged. We placed ourselves in the halls of Changling, which are as magnificent as the three great halls of the former capital. The architecture is majestic, and the round columns are all of the size that require several people to embrace. There are still remnants of communist bandit propaganda slogans on the walls of the corridor. Overlooking the entire scene of Changling from the tomb, one can see red walls and green tiles dotted among the green pines and cypresses. The halls and pavilions of Xianling in the Western Tombs have all disappeared, leaving only a pile of broken bricks and tiles, which is extremely regrettable. The other tombs are also the same.

### Continued Trial of the Zhonghe Bridge Tragedy in Nanjing, Two American Soldiers Involved in the Killing Are Interrogated, Defense Asks for Accidental Homicide Ruling Which Is Rejected

[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Zhonghe Bridge tragedy continued to be tried on the 18th. After the court session began at around 9 AM, Army Medical Officer Captain Erickson, Captain Yang Sizhong, and forensic doctor Wang Xiaoyin from the Capital District Court were first summoned, all of whom stated that Wang Ge's corpse was swollen and red, and his lips and nails were purplish-blue, with blood ulcers in his mouth and nose, all of which were signs of drowning. Subsequently, Major Weiss, the defendant's defense lawyer, stated that the witnesses' words were chaotic and contradictory and were not sufficient as evidence. The perpetrator's behavior was after being drunk, with no malicious intent and no premeditation. Therefore, the murder charge is not established, and he requested that it be treated as accidental homicide. Prosecutor Gan Nuoke retorted that continuously pushing people into the water clearly shows that one knows it is killing before malicious actions, which is premeditated. The presiding judge said that the contradictory and chaotic words of the witnesses did not prevent the court from selecting them and could not negate their effectiveness. As to whether there was malicious intent and premeditation, it will be decided by the court, and the defendant's defense lawyer's request was not allowed. Then Savanney was interrogated, and his words were hesitant, and he was sweating profusely. The hearing continued in the afternoon, and he was still very embarrassed. Adore's superiors expressed satisfaction with his usual words and actions. Adore himself said that he did not remember everything on the night of the incident. Regarding the statement that he returned to the camp for half an hour that night and telegraphed the American military police guarding the airport: "Do not tell anyone that he went to the airport, a Chinese person has drowned," he also claimed not to remember. Then Parker and Shilat, who were in the same car with Adore and Savanney that night, were interrogated, and their confessions in the Criminal Section of the American Military Advisory Group were read out. The court expressed satisfaction with Parker's testimony, which was clear and responsible, and immediately released him. Shilat was detained for his vague language. At 6 PM, the court ordered a continuation of the hearing at 9 AM on the 19th before adjourning.

### The United States Committee for Aid to China Allocates Funds to Assist in the Prevention and Treatment of Kala-Azar

[United States Information Service, New York, 17th] The headquarters of the Aid to China Committee here stated today: Part of the funds raised by the Aid to China Committee in the United States will be used to eliminate the terrible Kala-Azar disease in eastern China. This action by the Aid to China Committee will enhance the efforts of the American Friends Service Committee, which is currently working to eradicate the disease in Henan.

Authorities in the medical community believe that complete control of Kala-Azar is possible. Dr. Bosyk, a representative of the World Health Organization, recently stated in a speech at the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East that Kala-Azar can be eliminated by "very simple and economical methods." He pointed out that the disease is transmitted by sandflies and can be prevented from spreading by using insecticides such as DDT, and that already discovered cases can be treated by injecting antimony-containing compounds.

If Kala-Azar is not treated within two or three months, it will cause death within two years. It is estimated that 5% to 10% of the population near Yantai has Kala-Azar.

### Editorial: Export Trade After the Exchange Rate Reform

Since February of last year, our country's foreign exchange management policy has undergone three adjustments. Although the reasons for these adjustments are very complex, promoting exports and earning foreign exchange are undoubtedly among the main objectives. In particular, the implementation of subsidies for foreign exchange settlement of export goods in early February of this year is the most obvious.

What is most regrettable is that with each foreign exchange adjustment, the price of export goods immediately soared. Within days, the extent of the increase often equaled the benefits gained from the foreign exchange. In some cases, it even exceeded these benefits, so that domestic and foreign prices still could not converge, export goods still could not be promoted, the intended foreign exchange earnings still failed to materialize, and domestic production industries still could not be improved. The countryside is still declining day by day. The reason for this is that general speculators and export merchants who disregard the overall situation and blindly raise prices cannot escape the greatest responsibility.

Now, the control of export foreign exchange has been completely lifted. "Foreign exchange earned from exported goods and other remittances from abroad are allowed to be sold to designated banks at market prices." If exports are carried out according to the current loan market prices and foreign exchange market prices, then the US exchange rate has suddenly risen from 12,000 yuan to 38,500 yuan, invisibly reducing costs by more than twofold. The assistance given to exports is considerable. As Minister Yu said: "The situation of export goods and remittances from overseas Chinese can be improved compared to the past, which will be of great benefit to the balance of international payments and the national economy." However, the most important key to the foreign exchange reform is still to stabilize the price of export goods and prevent them from rising blindly, so as not to offset the benefits gained from the foreign exchange, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of raising exchange rates several times in the past. Regarding this point, this newspaper has already pointed out carefully in the editorial on the 17th, and the Governor of the Central Bank, Zhang, also "deeply hopes that export merchants will not take advantage of the superior market exchange rate to compete for purchases and raise prices, so as to affect overseas markets and cause exports to decline again."

Yesterday was the first day after the foreign exchange reform. Although the general response was still good, the trend of rising prices in general was very obvious. This is true for imported goods, and it is also true for exported goods; this is true for wholesale prices, and the fluctuation of retail prices is even more pronounced. If general merchants still only pursue profits and take the opportunity to raise prices, and are unwilling to "share the difficulties, enthusiastically assist the government to achieve the task," then the result of this lifting of export foreign exchange control is feared to be another pie in the sky, merely creating opportunities for general speculators.

In the past, the stagnation of the export industry was mostly attributed to the exchange rate being too low; it was believed that the cost of goods was too expensive, and it was impossible to compete with others in overseas markets. Now this obstacle has been removed, and judging from the current situation, preferential measures such as export subsidies and reciprocal tariffs are also unlikely to be implemented. The China Trust Bureau has also announced that all export goods purchase methods will be stopped. Then, apart from using the principle of "cheap and high-quality" to open up markets and compete with others, there are no other weapons available for the export industry to use. Therefore, the foreign exchange reform is the most critical juncture for the industry, and it is also the most critical juncture for the national economy. It is deeply hoped that general merchants and people will recognize this clearly, and that everyone will restrain the mood of seeking temporary profits, do not arbitrarily raise prices, and do not speculate and hoard, so as to leave a glimmer of hope for the country's foreign trade. We believe that in addition to earnest advice, the authorities should also take practical actions to remedy the situation in fact. The so-called strict prohibition of hoarding and speculation, strict prohibition of speculative manipulation, and even economic supervision and economic reporting meetings should be carried out vigorously at this time to give these people a practical blow. Regarding export materials, the government originally had various loans to promote them. We believe that from the time of the foreign exchange reform, all applications for such loans should be strictly examined and strictly limited to prevent them from taking the opportunity to use them to raise the price of goods. For those loans that have already been made but are stagnant, they should be urged to sell them in a timely manner to avoid fueling the hoarding trend. Because now is the time when they can be sold, there is no need to stand by and watch. As for government procurement of exports, we have always believed that it is a broad road to open up export trade. According to the current situation, the distance from the goal of true free trade is still far away, and the difficulties in exports are more than just foreign exchange. Now that foreign exchange has just been opened up, exports have not yet been launched, and the country has actually abandoned this policy first, we also believe that this is a very regrettable matter.

### The Main Points of Practicing Economy

The outline of measures for practicing economy and consumption has been passed by the State Council a few days ago and will be implemented from September 1st. At present, the measures for implementing this economy and consumption are still being formulated by relevant or central agencies and will be announced soon. We would like to take this opportunity to briefly discuss the practice of economy and consumption.

First of all, what we want to point out is that in the past, this newspaper has repeatedly written articles calling on the people to save voluntarily, but unfortunately, the effect was not obvious, and there has been no concrete expression of voluntary saving on the part of the people. Now that the country is mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, it cannot but restrict the lack of economy in consumption. A kind of deformed development of Chinese society is that production is not as good as Europe and the United States, but in terms of consumption, it wants to surpass them. Now that the country is mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, and the country has once again turned to a wartime system, this trend should be corrected in time. Therefore, we believe that at this time, the government should formulate measures for economical consumption and implement them. In post-war Britain, they did not mobilize to suppress the rebellion, but the economy they are now practicing is even more severe than during the war. In our current domestic situation, shouldn't we practice economy even more? We hope that the people of the whole country can share the difficulties and make every effort to save on consumption.

However, the so-called economical consumption requires cooperation between the government and the people. The people know the difficulties of the country, as long as the measures taken by the country are serious and strict, the people will also be content with reducing food and clothing and making every effort to economize. The reason why Britain's practice of economy has been successful is that the measures are well-thought-out and in line with human sentiment, and absolutely no special forces are allowed to be outside the law. Even the King of England, when repairing palaces, must comply with the rules of economy and must not act outside the law. Because all people, including the royal family, are equal before the law and abide by the law in the same way, the British people have repeatedly saved on consumption without any complaints, and the effect is very obvious. If we now implement economical consumption and want to achieve the expected success, the most important point is that the measures we set must be carefully considered and in line with human sentiment, and we must not act on a whim and end up in a mess with many drawbacks. For example, because we want to implement economical consumption, we completely prohibit the import of automobiles and stop issuing licenses, which is inevitably unreasonable. The use of automobiles can be restricted. If we do not think about it in this regard, but strictly prohibit the import of automobiles and stop issuing licenses, the result will inevitably lead to abuses and be exploited by general villains. As for other things that affect the livelihood of the general people and the tax revenue of local governments, we should be even more cautious. The formulation of this measure, in fact, is related to the freedom and rights of the people, and should be subject to legislative procedures to comply with the legal system. In addition, once the measures are formulated and announced, no special forces are allowed to be outside the law. Under these circumstances, economical consumption can have a real effect.

### Turbulent British Economic Situation: Attlee Suddenly Calls Emergency Cabinet Meeting; Signs of Division Emerge Within the Labour Party

[Reuters, London, 17th] Prime Minister Attlee returned to London from North Wales today to attend an emergency Cabinet meeting. This meeting was convened on the eve of Britain holding negotiations on easing the terms of the American loan. Therefore, London observers believe that the purpose of this meeting is to determine the conditions that Britain should propose to the United States. Before the meeting, it was heard that only a small number of members participated in this meeting, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, President of the Board of Trade Cripps, and Food Minister Strachey. These three departments are the departments most closely related to the British import crisis. Inspectors pointed out that when Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931, major decisions were also taken on Sundays. Although today's situation is not the same as in 1931, the convening of cabinet ministers on the weekend also proves that the situation is developing urgently. It has been seen that more and more people hold pounds and demand conversion. At the same time, according to estimates by financial experts, Britain's recent expenditure of American loans of "150 million yuan" has almost been exhausted. The increase in those demanding the conversion of pounds into dollars means that the current exchange rate between the pound and the dollar may not be able to be maintained, or the conversion of the pound will be restricted, or the value of the pound in New York will be allowed to fall naturally. Although Britain can take the latter approach, it is expected that the former measure is more likely to be taken.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Although the Cabinet meeting convened at No. 10 Downing Street today was officially explained as a routine Cabinet meeting during the parliamentary recess, it is generally believed that its meaning is extremely important. It should be to issue more resolute instructions to Sir Eddie, who has gone to Washington to negotiate British financial issues with the United States. The Labour Party has recently split into two factions: the compromise faction and the extreme socialist faction. Most of the cabinet members, including Prime Minister Attlee and Lord President of the Council Morrison, belong to the former. However, the minimum amount of assistance they advocate requesting from the United States seems unlikely to succeed due to the United States' reluctance to provide foreign loans, especially to socialist governments. It is said that the leader of the extremist faction is the Minister of Health, Bevan. They believe that Britain can obtain large amounts of food from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, so it can avoid American interference and the British socialist revolution. Recently, the Labour MP Crozeman, a spokesman for the extremist faction, stated that Britain's market is not for the United States but for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It has recently been learned that the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Cobbit, flew to Washington tonight, which proves that the Cabinet meeting convened today must be related to the dollar panic in Britain.

### Negotiations to Revise the Anglo-American Loan Agreement: British Delegation Arrives in New York; British Cabinet Meeting Directly Related to the Negotiations

[Reuters, New York, 17th] Sir Eddie, the chief representative of the British side who came here to negotiate with American officials to revise the terms of the Anglo-American loan agreement, declared upon arriving at LaGuardia Airport today that the issue of the United States providing another loan to Britain did not arise and was not included in the agenda of this meeting. Eddie said that the purpose of this negotiation is the 1945 loan agreement and the problem that the consumption of this loan is faster than expected by both Britain and the United States when the agreement was signed. We will explain Britain's position on the development of finance and the use of the loan.

Eddie also said: The Marshall Plan for Aid to Europe is also scheduled to be one of the topics of discussion. In addition, the British delegation plans to discuss the British film tax with American film industry leaders in Washington. British officials here believe that the opinions of the British Cabinet meeting held in London today to discuss the British economic crisis will be telegraphed to the British representatives participating in the Washington negotiations. Although officials have not stated that this Cabinet meeting is directly related to the Washington negotiations, the new proposals that Britain puts forward to the United States may be produced in this meeting. British officials also hope that this negotiation will not last for more than five to six days. They hope that at that time, at least the answer to the next question can be telegraphed back to London: that is, the United States Congress does not intend to convene a special meeting now, which means that the implementation of the Marshall Aid Plan will at least have to wait for seven months. During this transition period, can Britain obtain other assistance from the United States?

### Van Mook Writes to the Dutch Government, Requesting Completion of Sweep Operations; Indonesian President Calls on the People to Fight

[United Press, The Hague, 17th] News sources say that Van Mook of the Netherlands wrote to the Dutch government, saying: The situation in Java and Sumatra cannot be allowed to develop naturally, so he specifically requested the government to give him full power to immediately continue to complete the sweep operations. It is said that this letter has split the Dutch cabinet, which may cause a crisis. Van Mook is supported by military and civilian officials in Batavia, who wrote to the Queen of the Netherlands, advocating action. Some Dutch cabinet members feel uneasy about the Security Council's policies.

[United Press, Batavia, 18th] Indonesia celebrated the second anniversary of its independence on the 18th. President Sukarno said in a commemorative speech: "Indonesia will have no security, law, and order until the control of peace is entirely in our hands." He asked the Indonesian people to turn their homes into fortresses under the command of the Republican government.

[Reuters, Batavia, 17th] The Indonesian Antara News Agency said that the Indonesian government intends to invite Chiang Chia-tung, the Chinese Consul-General in Batavia, to personally visit Yogyakarta to inspect the living conditions of the Chinese people there.

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th, United Press] Nine Indonesian representatives have recently arrived here from Batavia to provide the Security Council with a plan to establish an Indonesian federation. According to Zhang Tiancong, an advisor to the Dutch Governor Van Mook and a representative of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia, the overseas Chinese have become victims of the Indonesian army's scorched earth policy, and said: Satika, a village inhabited by overseas Chinese, has become scorched earth, and the lives and deaths of the 3,000 overseas Chinese living in the village are unknown.

### South Korean Policy Conference Requests Swift Establishment of Government

[New Asia Agency, Seoul, 18th] The Policy Conference of the South Korean Provisional Government issued a statement today, saying: The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission does not understand the demands of the Korean people, which has led to more than 50 meetings of the commission without any progress, and instead has fallen into a deadlock.

The Korean people are suspicious of the trusteeship issue because they do not want to be interfered with by foreign forces.

### Americas Take Unified Action to Resist Aggression: Argentina to Express Agreement; Pan-American Defense Aims to Counter Soviet Obstructive Policy

[United Press, Brasilia, 17th] According to diplomatic sources on the 17th: Argentina will abandon its requested veto power on the issue of collective action to resist aggression, and accept the suggestion that the actions of American countries must be based on a two-thirds majority vote. It is generally expected that Argentine Foreign Minister Byrnes will "agree" with the principle of "unanimous" approval (that is, veto power), and for the sake of peace and security of the Pan-American Conference, will abandon its position and unanimously agree with other countries on the majority voting method. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's suggestion on Friday not to allow neutrality has been well received by the American republics. It is expected that Argentina's attitude will be affected by this. Marshall's suggestion is the center of the conference, and its content is to form a Pan-American Defense Pact, in which each contracting party should abide by all suggestions passed by the conference with a two-thirds majority, whether it involves diplomacy, economy, or military affairs, but it is not necessary to supply armed forces. It is generally believed that Marshall intends to use this defense pact to strengthen his momentum in the UN General Assembly in September, at which time he hopes to arouse the world's unified opposition to the Soviet Union's policy in Eastern Europe and obstruct the negotiation of the peace treaty. It is said that Marshall feels that regional agreements such as the Western Hemisphere Defense Pact are the only way to counter the Soviet Union's obstructive policy in the United Nations.

[United Press, Quitahatinga, Brazil, 17th] Argentina's desire to add economic topics to the American Twenty-Nation Defense Conference today has been opposed by the delegations of major countries.

### City Government Holds Emergency Economic Conference, Decides to Eradicate Smuggling Completely; Smuggled Goods Already Imported Must Be Sold Within a Time Limit; Continued Efforts to Eliminate the Black Market for Gold and US Dollars

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Central Government promulgated the new economic policy last week, the city government, in order to cooperate with the central directives, specifically convened a temporary economic inspection meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday. Mayor Wu personally presided over the meeting, listened to reports from all parties, and decided on various necessary measures. Mayor Wu also met with newspaper reporters in the city government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, reporting three points decided at the Economic Oversight Conference: (1) Completely eradicate smuggling. Hong Kong and the Central Government have already decided on cooperative measures. This city has also reached an agreement with the customs authorities. From now on, all smuggled goods without permits will be strictly prohibited from being imported. Smuggled goods that have already been imported should be sold within the time limit stipulated by the Central Government, otherwise they will be charged with hoarding for profit. As the above regulations are closely related to customs, in order to ensure their thorough implementation, in addition to inviting representatives from the customs to regularly attend the Economic Oversight Conference, it was also decided to convene relevant parties tomorrow to discuss specific measures. (2) Eliminate the black market for gold and US dollars, and continue to strive for thorough investigation. With the exception of the 29 banks designated by the Central Government, all buying and selling will be strictly prohibited. Off-market transactions will be even more strictly cracked down on. (3) Regarding food, because the allocation of rice and cooking oil is very large, there will be no impact or fluctuations. Moreover, the Central Government is as generous as possible with the exchange settlement of food. The issue of cooking oil, previously caused by re-export smuggling, has led to price increases. The Central Government has now explicitly banned re-exports. Finally, Mayor Wu emphasized that citizens must cooperate closely with the government and must not seek private gain, so that the Central Government's policies can be thoroughly implemented.

### Zhu Jingnong Goes to Camp to Encourage Hunan Soldiers

Zhu Jingnong, President of Kwang Hua University and Central Committee member, at the invitation of Director Fang, drove to the transit camp for soldiers leaving for the front at 9:00 AM yesterday to give a speech to the Hunan soldiers. More than a thousand officers and soldiers attended, all neatly dressed and in high spirits. Zhu said briefly: To build the country, we must ask everyone to stand up, unite, and sanction the enemies who destroy national construction, so that they will no longer destroy all construction work, and then we can complete it. This time everyone has answered the call, and the significance is very important. Especially in the last hundred years, the reputation of the "Hunan Army" has been very good. As the saying goes, "Without Hunan, there is no army," which shows that comrades from Hunan have always been happy to join the army and be brave in service. Generally, scholars can also set an example and set an example, such as Zeng Guofan of the late Qing Dynasty and Tan Yankai of modern times, who were both scholars holding military power. Mr. Tan made outstanding contributions to the cause of the national revolution. In addition, many revolutionary martyrs were comrades from Hunan. Today, some of those who came to listen to the speech are comrades from Anhui. Comrades from Anhui have always been enthusiastic about joining the army. In the past, the "Huai Army" and the "Hunan Army" were equally famous. Today, the two generals commanding the national army in the Northeast, General Zheng Dongguo is from Hunan, and General Sun Liren is from Anhui, which shows that the Anhui comrades' service to the country is not behind others. Today, some of you comrades are scholars who have abandoned their pens to join the army, some are rural youths who have volunteered enthusiastically, and some are veterans who have put on their uniforms again. No matter where you come from, I hope that you will unite, unify your will, and establish a good army that loves the country and the people, be loyal to the country, practice filial piety to the nation, and serve the people. Every one of our soldiers must aspire to be a pillar of the country, aspire to do great things, and I hope that you will cherish yourselves, love the country, and love the people. Finally, I wish you all a bright future and success in your careers.

### Seafarer Treatment Issues

Shipping Association Hopes for Sincere Consultation

The China Merchant Marine Drivers Association and other five seafarer groups, dissatisfied with the proposal of a few shipping companies in this city to reduce seafarer treatment, intend to petition the relevant authorities such as the Municipal Government to express their protest. Since this incident occurred, the shipping companies and the press in this city have paid close attention to it. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically interviewed relevant parties. It is understood that the treatment of seafarers serving in the major shipping companies in this city is agreed upon in advance through consultation between the Shanghai Shipping Union and the above five groups. Usually, the Shipping Union and the five groups get along very well, and the opinions of both labor and management are quite close. Even if a very small number of shipping companies intend to reduce seafarer treatment due to a sharp increase in expenses, the seafarer groups can report the situation to the union. The union, standing in the position of a third party, will naturally find ways to solve it, and the established agreement will never be changed because of this. The executive directors of this union can guarantee this responsibly. Therefore, the authorities of the Shipping Association sincerely hope that these five seafarer groups can continue to cooperate sincerely and openly based on their past understanding, which will be beneficial to both the public and private sectors.

In addition, the five groups opposing the reduction of treatment yesterday hosted reporters from various newspapers to report on the process, saying that the five groups were forced to rise up in opposition for their own benefit and the overall benefit of the shipping industry, and had no other intentions.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The trial of the Zhijiang ferry sinking disaster was continued yesterday in the Criminal First Division of the District Court, presided over by Judge Meng Tingke. In addition to Hu Ruhao, Captain Xin Chengfang of the Zhijiang ferry, Captain Zhang Jinsheng of the Huatong ferry, and Li Qianyu, the manager of the Tongji Shipping Company, representing Zhou Naihao, were all present in court for questioning. Xin and Zhang pushed responsibility onto each other on the issue of responsibility. Zhou Naihao stated that the Zhijiang Ferry Company was bankrupt due to the sinking of the ship and was unable to bear the additional civil lawsuit filed by the families of the victims, seeking compensation of over 1.29 billion yuan. The shipwreck is now being salvaged by the Port Authority, and work began on the 11th of this month and will take about two months to salvage. The total cost will be 900 million yuan plus 150,000 yuan. The court then summoned Xu Jihua, Sun Shiwang, the families of the victims, and witness Diao Dongzhao. The lawyers for both sides then began their arguments. According to the errors mutually pointed out by the defendant's lawyers, the Huatong ferry should have paid attention to the changes in the Zhijiang ferry but did not. The iron barge it was towing was larger than the shipping ship itself, and it violated the regulations by placing the tugboat on both sides of the ship. On the Zhijiang ferry side, the target was incorrect, and the ship was overloaded (it should have carried 300 people, but as a result, 900 people were rescued after the accident). Captain Xin Chengfang of the ship did not have a captain's license from the Ministry of Transportation, only a seaman's handbook, and lacked experience. Within an hour between the collision and the sinking, he could not find a way to prevent the ship from sinking. The agent lawyer for the 33 plaintiffs in the incidental civil lawsuit, Zhou Haigen and others, also detailed the difficulties of the families of the victims in court and asked the court to order the two defendants to compensate. The court, finding that the case was clear, announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 9:00 AM on the 25th. The defendants were released on their original bail.

### Executive Headquarters Assault Case: Xu Shichang Examined for Injuries and Accuses Liu Dewei

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the assault between Xu Shichang, the former Director of the General Affairs Department of the Executive Headquarters, now transferred to the position of specialist, and Liu Dewei, the Director of the Relief Department of the headquarters, Xu filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate on the 17th and was examined for injuries. Prosecutor Quan Tao and forensic doctor Shen Dajun questioned and examined him before ordering him to return. It is said that the injuries were very minor. According to Xu's complaint: On the morning of the 14th, refugees went to the Executive Headquarters to request relief, requesting three points: (1) Request to be sent back to their original residence; (2) Request to be dismissed according to the method of dismissing Shanghai workers; (3) Before the first two requests are resolved, the living expenses will be provided by the Executive Headquarters. Director Huo of the Executive Headquarters sent Xu and a section chief of the Relief Department to handle the matter. Liu, because it was not done by him, believed that Xu had deliberately overstepped his authority and cursed him out loud. Xu asked him not to curse. Liu said, "Not only will I curse, but I will also hit you." He then knocked off Xu's glasses, tore his clothes, and grabbed and bit Xu's little finger on his right hand. Afterward, Liu knew he was in the wrong and stabbed his own hand, falsely claiming that Xu had injured him. Afterward, he spread the word extensively, maliciously slandering and defaming him, etc. He also presented three evening newspapers and one mimeographed paper as evidence in court. The case will soon summon the defendant Liu Dewei for investigation. (Note: Liu Dewei is Xu's wife's younger sister).

### Another Batch of Surrendered Student Soldiers from the Northeast Arrives, Including Twelve Women

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the "Hai Zhou" transporting 1,800 student soldiers from the Northeast Youth Training Corps to Shanghai, the "Hai Su" ship arrived yesterday afternoon with another 2,700 student soldiers from the Fifth Brigade, docking at the Qiujiang Wharf. All will be sent to Hankou on the original ship within a few days. According to Brigade Commander Xu Zihan, they were all captured by the communists or voluntarily surrendered a few months ago. The government has now decided not to pursue the past and allow them to start anew. In the future, it is planned to implement centralized training for three months in Hankou, and then employ them according to their talents. Their current clothing, rations, etc., are completely the same as the treatment of the National Army. Therefore, they expressed great gratitude for the government's leniency.

Talking with Three Women

There were also twelve women in this batch of student soldiers, originally nurses and political workers at a communist Northeast wounded soldier hospital. Reporters interviewed Lin Cuifeng, Li Wu, and Wang Guifen. According to them, they were mostly natives who were taken by the communists when they went to see the bandits occupying southern Shandong. Their husbands were forcibly drafted into the army, so they had no choice but to wander with them, serving as nurses and political workers in the hope of reuniting their families. However, the communists only regarded them as outsiders, deceived them everywhere, and never allowed them to approach their core cadres. Moving with the army, they had to travel more than 100 miles day and night, and they were exhausted. As a result, there were frequent escapes. If they were chased, the communists did not care about their fate at all. Therefore, they waited day and night in the communist areas for an opportunity to surrender to the National Army. When asked about the relationship between men and women among the communists, the three replied shyly, "A complete mess." But then they said, "We never messed around with them."

Thirteen-Year-Old Children Are Also Forced to Carry Guns

In addition, there was a "Chu Wenmei" in this batch of student soldiers who was only thirteen years old. Because she was forced to work in intelligence for the communists, she was captured. She said: "There are many children like me on the front line. The communists want us to carry guns, but we are really not as tall as a gun!"

According to all of them, they hope that the government can make a decision as soon as possible so that they can have the opportunity to serve the country again after training. These people, who have experienced much hardship, are all in very good health. They did not disembark after arriving in Shanghai and have already received cholera vaccinations on board.

The Seven Student Soldiers Did Not Have True Cholera

It was discovered that seven people among the surrendered student soldiers carried by the "Hai Zhou" ship had cholera. They were isolated and treated nearby. According to the Health Bureau, the results of the stool examination by the Health Experiment Institute showed that none of them had true cholera. The entire crew of the ship underwent cholera prevention injections by the epidemic prevention team of the Health Bureau and were thoroughly disinfected.

### Du Shouming and Other Celebrated Actors Unite for Charity Performance, Public Ticket Sales to Benefit Disaster Relief

[Our Newspaper's Report] August 30th (the 15th day of the seventh lunar month) is the 60th birthday of Mr. Du Yuesheng.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Quan Xun once founded the Subei Free Elementary School on Xingguo Road, hiring Yang Bin, a major general from the Ministry of National Defense and a native of Yancheng, as the school's chairman. Yang then recommended Chen Tinghuang as the principal and Xiao Wenwei as the director of academic affairs. Later, Quan and Yang's relationship broke down, and Quan accused Yang of embezzling school property, which was dismissed due to the general amnesty.

### Wang Xifan Case, Accused of Doing Business with the Enemy, Scheduled for Trial

The Shanghai No. 6 Printing and Dyeing Factory of the China Textile Construction Company on Dapu Road in this city was originally the Ichida Dyeing Factory operated by the Japanese. Its predecessor was the Wantong Cloth Factory, organized by Wang Xifan with raised capital, covering only a dozen acres. Before it could start operations, the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred. During the occupation, Wang collaborated with the Gongda Yarn Factory, serving as the chairman of the factory. He expanded the factory site to over a hundred acres, cooperating with the Japanese factory managers Makino Naoji and Inoue Mitsujiro successively.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the factory was transferred by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the China Textile Construction Company and renamed the Shanghai No. 6 Printing and Dyeing Factory. It began restoration in January of the 35th year of the Republic [1946]. However, Wang Xifan applied to the Bureau for the Handling of Enemy and Puppet Industries for its return. On June 24th of last year, he went to the factory to complete the return procedures. The factory's entire staff, driven by righteous indignation, collected various pieces of evidence and reported the case to the Shanghai Higher Procuratorate according to the law.

### Climbing the Highest Peak of Jade Mountain, Southeast Asia's Alps, Perennial Snow Cover, Uninhabited, Scientists Discover New Treasures

[Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun, Taipei, August 12th] The planned, collective ascent of Jade Mountain in Taiwan, in which the reporters participated in this scientific expedition, can be said to be unprecedented, if not unparalleled. In the past, people who climbed Mount Tai looked down upon the world. Although I dare not say that climbing Jade Mountain allows one to look down upon the Western Pacific, after climbing the mountain, we were provided with many facts that can be used as counter-evidence or supporting evidence. These facts were obtained only after completing the climb.

Jade Mountain is the most pristine and sacred mountain, but it was seized by the Japanese and used as their New High Mountain. We have no reason to abide by the Japanese emperor's decree. The reporter has written a record of climbing this mountain, taking Jade Mountain as the theme. Jade Mountain is a mountain peak that can be admired but not reached, reaching 3,950 meters in height, 200 meters higher than the second-highest mountain in Taiwan's Central Mountain Range, 1,450 meters higher than Mount Tai, Mount Huang, and Mount Lu, and 850 meters higher than Mount Emei. It is the only high peak in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

Taiwan Prefecture Chronicle: "Jade Mountain is rarely visited by people. Three peaks stand side by side, covered in snow all year round, like dragon incense seals. It is visible on clear winter days, but clouds and fog will soon reassemble." Zhuluo County Chronicle (ancient Jiayi): "The momentum of the Dagang flows into the inner mountains, smoke and mist swirling, the peaks cannot be counted, auspiciousness gathers southward, rushing for more than seven hundred li, suddenly stopping and residing, with tall, upright, and round peaks standing alone, called Dawuluan Mountain, which is the main mountain of the county seat. Three peaks stand side by side, protecting the mountains, strangely young and clear, towering above the back of Dawuluan is Jade Mountain, the rear barrier of the county's main mountain. The mountain is covered by clouds and fog throughout the year, and it is rarely seen." According to historical records, in 1850, Robert Swinhoe, the British consul stationed in Tainan, specially named the group of mountains after Captain Morrison William of the S.S. Alaxander merchant ship. On July 6th of the 30th year of Meiji [1897], the Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs announced in Gazette No. 6 that the original name Jade Mountain would be changed to New High Mountain by imperial edict, meaning "within the territory, a new peak 200 meters higher than Mount Fuji has been obtained," which the Japanese considered "glorious." Jade Mountain is covered in snow all year round. This was said before the climate change of the previous generation. Now, snow cover is declared above 3,000 meters from December to February each year. During the hottest summers, the temperature is suitable for late autumn at the foot of the mountain. Jade Mountain can be called the Alps of Southeast Asia, and it is remarkably similar in geology and geological history.

The Main Peak is in Sight, the Road is Long, Altitude Sickness Attacks Fiercely

In the embrace of the mountains, a line, not quite in formation, follows the Nanzi Xian Stream, tracing the silhouette of the main peak. The main peak appears close at hand, but there is still a long way to go. On the eroded sedimentary rock fragments, on the ancient pines lying across the collapsed valleys, on the damp bamboo leaf pine branch moldy paths, on the newly repaired bridges in Tainan County, we drag our heavy steps and move forward slowly.

At the mountainside of 3,000 meters, everyone feels the heavy pressure on their bodies and minds. We begin to feel dizzy, have tinnitus, heavy heads and light feet, and become drowsy. People who have climbed Jade Mountain say that this is altitude sickness. The reporters, Professor Jin Cheng, and Section Chief Yongyan were the last to lag behind. We mustered our last remaining strength and climbed step by step over vertical cliffs of more than 300 meters, straight to the main peak. Suddenly, clouds came, and suddenly, rain came. The rain brought wind, and the severe cold froze our hands and turned our noses red. We have moved from the tropical zone to the frigid zone.

After climbing over the main peak, there is a four-kilometer downhill and cross-slope. Only then do we reach the only lodging place—the meteorological station dormitory. The most feared thing on Jade Mountain is the low pressure at high altitude, but even more terrifying than this is the long and arduous mountain road after crossing the main peak. Thanks to the advance team, they brought me a cup of sweet water. This is the elixir of life. After ten hours of climbing, we were able to lie down in this only lodging place in the high mountains.

On the night at the foot of the North Peak, at 3,833 meters, the air pressure dropped to 466 mm (normal is 760 mm), and the temperature reached freezing point. We surrounded the stove, wearing cold-proof clothing and adding blankets and quilts, but still did not feel warm. We all seemed to be in a dream, coming to the high mountains to find winter. Looking in the mirror, everyone was unfamiliar with their own faces, fat and swollen. My nose was even bleeding. Altitude sickness attacks every traveler, conquering He Chunsun, a technician familiar with mountain climbing, Wang Jiaru, a researcher at the museum, and Wang Kang of the News, all three of whom could not eat, felt cold, and had dizzy heads. On the second morning in the high mountains, they were determined to follow the mountain compatriots down the mountain, but when they reached the main peak, they could not withstand the strong winds and rain (the wind speed at the summit was 610 mm, and the wind speed at the foot of the mountain was 260 m), and they turned back. Their embarrassing, miserable, and frozen hands and feet are still vivid in my mind.

You must think it is interesting, but when we went down the mountain, it was a rare sunny day. The main peak was set off in the faint morning light. The mountain was quiet, and the rising sun revealed a smile on the horizon of the peaks. On this morning when we were about to leave Jade Mountain, I was in love with the beauty of this changing nature.

The only way to overcome altitude sickness is to quickly leave the high altitude of 2,000 or 3,000 meters, normal air pressure [is key], and maintain a constant amount of blood pressure and atrial heart beats. Precisely because the mountain is high, there is not a single mountain village within a few dozen kilometers; the steep Patungkuan [trail] is on the cliffs, and even the shadows of the mountain compatriots have disappeared.

Our newspaper reporter's swollen face can be vaguely seen when going down the mountain. Two mountain compatriots carrying baggage still follow closely behind. (Photo by Jiang Muyun)

### Interesting Stories of Arresting Traitors in Qingdao, Zhang Lingyun Double Identity Case

[Our Newspaper's Qingdao, August 18th Dispatch] After Zhang Lingyun, the president of Xinsheng News Agency, was arrested due to a false accusation based on personal grudges, even though there was no evidence of his guilt, he is still detained in court and has lost his freedom. The truth is gradually becoming clear. It is said that this case involves a double identity case. There is another Zhang Lingyun, styled Wenpu, a native of Wanping, who did serve in puppet positions such as a pacification team of the New People's Society in Weixian and Jimo, and later worked at the Qingdao Sanmeng Branch. After the victory, fearing accusations, he fled to his native Beiping. This traitor issue has become increasingly deadlocked.

### Kala-Azar Disease in Suzhou Prefecture, Terrible Mortality Rate

According to preliminary investigations, more than 10,000 people have been infected, and the mortality rate is alarming. Although the county health院 has drafted a plan for eradication, it has been unable to implement it due to limited funds. Various legal entities have appealed to the provincial health院 and the Anhui Relief Branch to allocate drugs for relief.

[Another Dispatch] Tragic assassination cases have repeatedly occurred in the rural areas of this county. Zhou Falu, his wife Tangshi, and his son Tieniu, four villagers from Yin Jiahu Village in Hancun Township, were shot and killed by five plainclothes thugs on the night of the 14th.

### Anhui Province Scheduled to Start Collecting Taxes

[Our Newspaper's Hefei, August 16th Dispatch] The measures for collecting taxes and loans in kind in Anhui Province this year have been stipulated by the central government as one tael of tax silver, three dou of rice, three dou of loan, one dou of additional security military rations, and nine sheng of public grain at the provincial and county levels, totaling seven dou and nine sheng. The province has been ordered to start collecting taxes as soon as possible to meet the needs of the pacification of the rebellion. After receiving the order, the Provincial Land and Grain Office adjusted the 62 counties, establishing offices in 53 counties, including Yuexi, Qimen, Zhizhi, Tongling, Dongliu, and Huo Counties. The Land and Grain Sections with smaller tax amounts were all abolished, and the business was changed to collect legal tender, which was handled by the Finance Sections of each county. Now that the new grain has entered the market in each county, the provincial government has issued a notice to the 62 counties to follow the stipulated standards. The counties that collect wheat are limited to starting the collection on September 1st, and the counties that collect grain are limited to starting the collection on September 15th.

### Steamship Robbed Between Jiaxing and Shuanglin, Escorting Police Shot

[Our Newspaper's Jiaxing, August 17th Dispatch] At about 3:00 AM this morning, the Feishun steamship, operating between Jiaxing and Shuanglin, set sail from Shuanglin. About eight miles from the suburbs, eight bandits suddenly appeared among the passengers. Two or three of them were wearing grass-green military uniforms and had reserve officer corps badges. They each took out pistols and forced the driver to stop the boat. They then began robbing passengers in the cabin. The six police officers escorting the ship also drew their firearms and fought with the bandits. As a result, one bandit was shot in the right chest, and one of the escorting police officers was shot in the right knee and right wrist. However, they were ultimately outnumbered, and the rifles carried by the escorting police were inconvenient for shooting, while the bandits were all using short guns. The escorting police were unable to resist, and all their firearms, including one machine gun, four rifles, and one wooden-holstered pistol, were confiscated. The entire cabin of passengers was then robbed, with no one spared. After about forty minutes, the robbery was completed. The wounded bandit and the confiscated firearms were taken away one by one, and they went ashore. The ship then sailed to Jiaxing, and the wounded police officer was sent to the Provincial Hospital for treatment. It is estimated that the passengers on the ship were robbed of about 20 million yuan.

### Bu Nanyong Arrives in Suzhou

### Japanese Goods Dumped in Hong Kong: 15,000 Alarm Clocks - Can They Wake Up Those in Slumber?

[Our Correspondent Li Sen, Hong Kong, 16th] The Hong Kong government and the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Japan had already agreed on the trade relationship between Hong Kong and Japan at the end of last year. Japanese goods have been steadily entering Hong Kong under the procurement of the Hong Kong government. First came cotton yarn, followed by cotton cloth and woolen fabrics. Recently, small quantities of Japanese daily necessities and Japanese specialties such as dried scallops and abalone have also appeared in the market. Japanese goods, absent for less than five years, have "affectionately" reunited with the residents of Hong Kong. The "colorful" printed fabrics produced by the Japanese textile industry are already worn by every woman, and the expensive British and American textiles are gradually being squeezed out of department store windows.

The Hong Kong government, in order to "stabilize prices," disregards the potential impact of Japanese goods on Hong Kong's post-war industrial recovery (not to mention the indirect impact on Guangzhou or South China's industries).

Japanese goods are continuously procured, and the general public is happy to buy them because they are cheap, considering their "wallets." Thus, Japanese goods are invading the Hong Kong market with a new post-war attitude.

The Hong Kong Imports and Exports Department's statistics have included trade figures with Japan since June. It is reported that in June, goods imported from Japan into Hong Kong included 100 yards of cotton fabrics, valued at HK$3,096,773, and 80,000 yards of silk and rayon fabrics, valued at HK$300,804. The Imports and Exports Department also announced that goods imported from Japan from January to May this year were valued at HK$29,815,047. Therefore, in the first half of this year, Japanese goods imported into Hong Kong were valued at over HK$33 million (in Hong Kong dollars), which is about one-quarter of American goods or one-half of British goods, ranking fifth among importing countries, surpassing Australia and India. Hong Kong's exports to Japan were also valued at over one million Hong Kong dollars.

Japanese-made enamelware, water heaters, washbasins, plates, cooking utensils, glass cups, porcelain cups and saucers, combs, umbrellas, hair clips, pencils, watercolor paints, other stationery, and even children's toys almost occupied the entire Hong Kong market before the war. They have not yet been imported in large quantities after the war. After the opening of private foreign trade in Japan on August 15 this year, those daily necessities that are known for their cheapness will make a comeback and flood every corner of the Hong Kong market. At that time, Hong Kong's post-war industrial recovery will suffer a fatal blow.

The Hong Kong business community is already feeling the direct threat of the re-dumping of Japanese goods and is actively planning remedial measures. The weaving industry, which holds a leading position in Hong Kong's industry, is the first to bear the brunt and is in imminent danger. The Southeast Asian cotton fabric market, which used to rely on Hong Kong's supply, has now been seized by Japanese goods. The most popular "sarong" in Southeast Asia is sold by Japanese merchants for about HK$1.70 per yard, while Hong Kong goods cost HK$2, and the patterns and fabric quality are not as exquisite as those of Japan. Even if Southeast Asian overseas Chinese merchants are patriotic and do not buy Japanese goods, what can they do about the influence on buyers' psychology!

Before the war, Hong Kong's weaving industry relied on low labor costs and the priority supply of British and Indian yarn, barely competing with Japanese goods. However, the source of British yarn was cut off after the war, and Indian yarn is no longer sold to Hong Kong. If Hong Kong's weaving industry does not rely on Japanese yarn, it must rely on Shanghai yarn, and the cost of wages has already increased more than five times compared to before the war. According to a survey by merchants, the production cost of Hong Kong's weaving industry is at least one-third higher than that of Japanese goods. How can it resist the dumping of Japanese goods?

In order to reverse the decline, the Hong Kong business community, initiated by the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, has organized a delegation to Southeast Asian British and Dutch colonies to hold small-scale Hong Kong goods exhibitions in major ports in Southeast Asia to expand publicity and counter Japanese goods. Currently, the participants include more than ten units, including the weaving industry, dyeing industry, hardware industry, match industry, pharmaceutical industry, printing industry, cosmetics industry, stationery industry, paint industry, and silk industry. They will depart in mid-August.

The Japanese are not a nation known for humor, but recently they did something extremely humorous: they brought in 15,000 alarm clocks. People in deep sleep, let's see if this time you will be woken up!

### Wuhu Huasheng Street Bloodshed: Murderer Liang Yunbiao on the Run; Support Association Offers a Reward of Ten Million to Capture Him

[Our Correspondent, Wuhu, 18th] The murderer Liang Yunbiao in the Huasheng Street bloodshed has not been captured as of this morning. The 24-hour deadline set by the authorities has passed.

### Yushan Weather Station: Observers at Work

On the lonely peak of Yushan (Mount Jade), members of the scientific expedition are excavating new treasures from the high mountains. This unique weather station, due to its location on the Tropic of Cancer and its geographical advantages, is suitable for observing high-altitude planets, the sun, and atmospheric electricity. Generally speaking, it can see two and a half times more stars than on the plains. Currently, there are six observers working, and eight mountain workers are responsible for carrying rice and goods. Their only specialty is traversing mountains as if walking on flat ground. They are almost rotated every six months, observing in the high mountains like meditating old monks. This small group of people on the high peak has become like another world. Director Shi Yanhuan of the Meteorological Bureau has promised to improve the treatment and increase entertainment facilities for the technicians. He also told the workers that he hopes they will learn Mandarin, refrain from smoking and drinking, and become promising Chinese youths.

Bi Qingchang, Director of the Geological Survey, originally planned to come and survey the geological route, but he was disappointed. He was disappointed that geological workers may not be able to overcome altitude sickness; and determining the geological structure and whether there are glaciers requires a dedicated and prolonged period.

Japanese plant surveys and classifications began as early as 1905. The vertical distribution of alpine plants includes 27 species. The only ones we can see with our naked eyes are fir and juniper, as well as shrubs, mosses, and sparse insects and birds. Si Wei, who studies breeding, discovered earthworms. He does not believe this is a cold zone. The high solar radiation causes everyone's faces to swell and peel.

This scientific expedition includes 14 people: Shi Yanhuan, Bi Qingchang, Wang Renyu, He Chunsun, Teng Yongyan, Yang Zhuoran, Si Wei, Jin Cheng, Wang Jiaru, Liang Runsheng, Li Shijun, Gao Yingshi, Wang Kang, and me. The scientists are not satisfied with staying on the summit for two days, but due to the lack of a comfortable environment and time, they quickly descended the mountain. However, it took ten days, making them all comrades in distress.

As we followed the original path down the mountain, when the reporter passed the "Cliff of Silent Prayer" inscribed by the Japanese, Director Shi said that it was to commemorate a journalist who died in an accident. I was dazed for a long time. Looking back at the bottom shadow of Yushan, which soared into the sky, the mood of being proud of climbing the 3,950-meter peak was stirred up again. Is it humanity conquering nature? Or is it nature conquering humanity? This is a major test. (Mu Yun, from Taipei)

### Various Parties Respond Very Favorably to the Government's Foreign Exchange Management Measures, Considering Them the Most Wise Measures of the Present Day

[Our Newspaper Report] After the government announced the revised foreign exchange management and import-export trade measures, this reporter, in order to understand the opinions of various parties on the government's new measures, specifically visited various parties and inquired about their opinions. The following is a summary:

Xu Jiquan, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said that the government's measures are extremely reasonable. Their effect can activate export goods and increase overseas remittances. Regarding the point that five types of goods are still settled at the official exchange rate, this is considered to supplement the profits and losses of China's agricultural products and suppress the price increase of essential daily necessities. In the future, it is hoped that merchants can support government policies, work hard together, and not allow prices to rise arbitrarily. Taking patriotism as a prerequisite, the black market price will naturally disappear.

Qiu Liangrong, Deputy Secretary-General of the International Trade Association, said that after the government implements the new foreign exchange control measures, it will not be difficult for the export industry, which has been in a dormant state, to gradually recover and achieve prosperity. In the future, the increase in export figures, supplemented by overseas remittance income, will be sufficient to offset limited imports, and it is expected to obtain a surplus. In the past, export goods could not be developed due to the exchange rate being too low. This adjustment is extremely reasonable. However, in the future, export merchants should still strive to promote exports and strive for a large amount of foreign exchange as the ultimate goal.

Fundamental Obstacles Must Still Be Eradicated

Zhang Yaozhang, Chairman of the Import-Export Association, said that this measure is nothing less than the only possible way out of the current dead end in import-export trade. All aspects can be taken into account, which is especially commendable. The export trade is given room for activity, and although imports are still subject to licensing restrictions, the increase in overseas remittances and export foreign exchange is expected to increase or relax import quotas, which will help both imports and exports. The evasion of overseas remittances and trade smuggling can be effectively curbed by the promulgation of this measure. The principle of this measure is beyond reproach and is a wise policy of epoch-making significance in foreign exchange trade after the war. However, if you want to achieve the expected results, you must take into account the following prerequisites:

1. The difficulties of the export industry in the past seem to be only a exchange rate problem on the surface, but in fact, its fundamental crux lies in currency inflation, traffic obstruction, and production reduction. We hope that after the promulgation of this new measure, effective measures can be taken to address these fundamental obstacles. Otherwise, export materials will be short of supply and prices will soar, as happened in the previous few times the exchange rate was adjusted. The result will be that prices and foreign exchange will continue to soar. Ultimately affect other prices, this point is most worrying.

2. It is hoped that export smuggling can be eliminated. However, if import smuggling, such as the issuance of import quotas and licenses, is still insufficient to meet actual needs, not only will smuggling be inevitable, but it will also be a huge obstacle to eliminating the black market for foreign exchange. Therefore, import controls must be appropriately relaxed, otherwise the consequences will still be difficult to be optimistic about.

The phenomenon that may occur at present is the fluctuation of various prices, especially export materials. The government should immediately sell materials in order to stabilize material prices and stabilize people's psychological anxiety. Therefore, we should put forward a point to urge the government authorities to pay attention. At present, there is a huge amount of goods accumulated in the Shanghai Customs warehouse that cannot be cleared and imported because they have not obtained a license. If they can be released during this period and stipulate that the cargo owner sell them within a certain period of time, it will be beneficial to curb the possible price increase.

Quota Allocation Disputes Can Be Avoided

Industrialist Hu Boxiang expressed his opinions on adjusting foreign exchange and import-export control measures as follows: "This is a reasonable action. In the past, there were disputes over the allocation of quotas in the industry, because those who obtained official exchange rates were too cheap, and those who did not get them suffered too much; now, after this adjustment, everything tends to be fair and reasonable. As for the determination of the listed market price, it is hoped that it will be close to the natural level and slightly lower than the "black market", otherwise it will only create a "second official price", which will not help matters. As far as the impact on industry is concerned, factories that have obtained more official exchange rates in the past, such as rubber paper factories, etc., will inevitably be slightly affected once they stop obtaining cheap raw materials; however, the vast majority of factories obtain most of the raw materials they use from the black market, so today's adjustment method has a small impact on production costs. As for general prices, they will not fluctuate greatly under the dual threat of weak purchasing power and Japanese goods entering China." Hu believes that whether overseas remittances can be absorbed in large quantities depends entirely on whether the listed market price can be close to the natural level. As for the export of domestic goods, because my country's production costs are too high, even with this adjustment, the government still needs to provide other assistance in order to sell well in foreign markets.

The Import and Export Industry Can Be Active

The general response of the import and export industry in this city to the new measures for import and export and foreign exchange management can be summarized as follows: (1) The new measures are very reasonable. If the listed market price can be close to the black price, then huge overseas remittances will not leak out again. (2) The adjustment of the exchange rate is very beneficial to exports. My country's exports, which have been stagnant for a long time, will be active again. However, there are also concerns, because Chinese and foreign merchants competing to purchase export materials will cause their prices to rise sharply. At the same time, the result of a large number of exports will be that foreign prices will decrease. When it reaches a certain level, exports will be difficult again. However, if the exchange rate is extended again at that time, exports can still be profitable. (3) If importers can get a sufficient supply of foreign exchange, the black market will naturally disappear. However, my country's foreign exchange position is limited, and the needs of various public and private parties are large, so the number that can be supplied to importers may not be large. If the export situation is not good, the amount of overseas remittances absorbed is not large, and the import needs a large amount of foreign exchange due to the high profits, then the central bank's supply will be insufficient, and it will inevitably seek it from the black market again. In this way, in addition to the price, a market will occur again. The avoidance of all these unfavorable situations depends on the ingenuity of the Balancing Committee.

### Silversmiths Visit Director Wu, Requesting Opening of Ornaments Control

[Our Newspaper Report] Because the measures for managing foreign exchange have been revised by the government, the silversmiths specifically sent five representatives, Yao Guiqing, Qiu Yungen, Chen Dezhang, Wu Pengnian, and Feng Qing'an, to visit Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau this morning, hoping that the government can also open up the control of ornaments. Director Wu expressed considerable sympathy in principle. However, he said that he has recently been busy preventing fluctuations in daily necessities for the people after the foreign exchange change, and that he must wait until after the announcement of a section before he can convey it to the central government.

### Prices in Beijing Slightly Increase

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Shanghai foreign exchange market price was transmitted here this afternoon after the central bank listed it on the 18th. This morning, the market in Beijing rose across the board due to speculation about the market price. In the afternoon, it gradually softened again. The storm caused by the revision of the foreign exchange control measures in Beijing did not seem to be too severe.

### To Prevent Fluctuations in the Yarn Market, the Spinning and Weaving Association Temporarily Allocates Yarn, All Sold at the Negotiated Price Last Saturday

[Our Newspaper Report] In order to cooperate with the new foreign exchange policy and prevent fluctuations in the yarn market, the Spinning and Weaving Association specially entrusted the China Textile Construction Company to temporarily increase the allocation of cotton yarn in addition to the yarn amount of the joint distribution. The cotton yarn was spun by the association from the quota of cotton purchased from various factories in the first quarter. Yesterday, a total of 1,112 households applied for the purchase. 1,713 pieces of joint distribution yarn were sold, and 1,237 pieces of temporarily allocated cotton yarn were sold, all at the negotiated price last Saturday.

In addition, the company stipulated four measures for the temporary increase of cotton yarn allocation yesterday, which are recorded as follows:

(1) The amount of cotton yarn applied for by the reproduction industry will not be included in the prescribed sales quota, but the allocated amount will still be based on the prescribed ratio. (2) In addition to the reproduction industry, the yarn numbers registered with the company may also apply for purchase. (3) All procedures for applying to purchase this cotton yarn shall be handled in accordance with the company's regulations. (4) The yarn number received shall be sold at the negotiated price of the Spinning and Weaving Association. If there is a violation of the negotiated price, severe penalties will be imposed.

Yarn Prices Slightly Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was still good at the beginning of the market, but soon people's minds were idle, and it was heard that in addition to the listed sale by the Textile Construction Company, the Shenxin and Yong'an yarn factories were also selling a large amount in the market, which further restricted the market situation. In addition, the settlement of cotton foreign exchange in the list of official prices caused concerns from all parties, and there were many sales. However, the final line was still slightly firmer than on Saturday. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix rose 200,000 compared to Saturday, to 17.4 million. 20-count special double and light double horse both rose 100,000, to 11.9 million and 10.6 million. 16-count Guangming coarse yarn was stable, while other counts of coarse and fine yarn rose by 1,230,000, but 32-count Silver Moon, 20-count Tiannv, and 10-count Hao brands fell by 120,000.

Cotton Cloth Stable

Yesterday's cotton cloth market, because the import of Japanese goods was prohibited in the morning, all parties took the opportunity to play up the issue, and all cloths were opened at high prices, but because the settlement of cotton foreign exchange had less impact, most colleagues looked at the small side. Actual sales were still clear, and the street's suction stomach was also dull, and the market trend turned from firm to soft.

Finally, the price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 450,000, a squeeze increase of 8,000 compared to last Saturday. Five-blessing blue chicken colored ball Yanghe and other grades of fine cloth also rose by 9,000 to 10,000, Four Gentlemen and Jinlian Miaowu Serge raised more than 10,000 yuan, white blank polyester cloth rose by 120,000 yuan, raw cloth flower cloth and coarse cloth and other markets were also very good, blue cloth and Shilin cloth market was still stable.

Cotton Market Weak and Soft

Yesterday's spot cotton market situation was stable, and the price was not significant. After the improved new foreign exchange rate, the source of foreign cotton was still supplied by the government at the old official exchange rate, so people's minds were weak and soft. The price was difficult to improve, and transactions became quiet again. Various grades opened: warehouse delivery price, treasure 2.03 million, 2.05 million, 2.06 million, Hankou fine velvet 1.94 million, 1.96 million, Shashi 1.88 million, Shandong wooden frame 1.9 million, Zhangde 2.035 million, Laohekou 1.9 million, Chong Tongzhou 1.6 million, Zhoupu seed flower 315,000, and sent to Qingdao City, weighing Lingbao 1.8 million.

### Tung Oil Merchants Decide to Stabilize Tung Oil Market Price

[Central News Agency, This City] The Tung Oil Exporters Association and the Tung Oil Ramie Industry Commercial Association of this city held a joint meeting on (the 18th) due to the government's announcement of the revision of the foreign exchange management and import-export trade measures. The main points of the case are recorded as follows: (1) The government's purpose in partially opening up foreign exchange this time is to encourage exports. The intention is good, and our tung oil exporters and oil colleagues should support the government's intention, support the national policy, and never raise prices arbitrarily, which will affect the entire price. According to the current foreign market price, each pound is US$0.23 FOB Shanghai delivery. Excluding the exporter's commission, it is about 850,000 National Currency per market load. Therefore, the tung oil exporters' bid to purchase should not exceed the above price in principle. (2) In order to make domestic oil merchants understand the market price, the situation here has been reported by telegram. It has been unanimously agreed that the foreign price is 0.22 (per pound FOB) to prevent the decline (excluding the exporter's commission). The purchase prices in various places are Hankou 700,000, Chongqing 600,000, and Wanxian 600,000. Each exporter shall not purchase beyond the limit price in order to avoid disturbing the market and stabilizing the oil price.

(3) The quotation for foreign countries has been decided that the selling price shall not be lower than US$0.23 FOB Shanghai delivery per pound, fearing that foreign merchants will take advantage of this opportunity to deliberately lower the purchase price.

(4) At present, the China Trust Bureau holds a large amount of oil in stock. In order to stabilize the foreign sales price, the China Trust Bureau should not sell at a low price or dump the price, so as not to disturb the market. The foreign sales price should not be lower than 23 FOB.

(5) Today's domestic sales market price is 800,000, and there have been no transactions. Therefore, the domestic sales price will not exceed this number. At the same time, because the export price is 850,000, the goods purchased by domestic households or other ports may return to Shanghai for sale. It is estimated that there will be about 500 tons. In addition, smugglers who originally planned to smuggle tung oil to Taiwan or other ports for transportation and sales may also transport it back to Shanghai for sale due to the correction of foreign exchange.

### Major Holders Sell High, Hua Stocks Rise and Fall Violently

Hua stocks boosted yesterday as the partial opening of foreign exchange has been announced, and the public's confidence has increased greatly, especially the US-Asia China Silk, which is beneficial to the export business, is the most trusted by the public. It was very lively when it went on the market, and the price rose to the limit. The cold stock Xin Ya also once rose to the limit. However, the bulls joined forces and a large number of them went on the market, and Yong yarn was tired after the firm step. After 10 o'clock, the speculation of the foreign exchange market price listing spread, and people's minds were shaken, and the decline intensified. Those who had risen to the limit also fell back, and each stock suddenly reported that the situation was getting worse and worse. Almost all the familiar stocks ended at low prices. It was very unfavorable at the close.

Chen opened at high prices, especially China Silk US-Asia opened higher. After Yong yarn opened, Nos. 207, 220, 171, and 8 all entered, rising to 225 yuan. China Silk was from Nos. 173, 12, etc., and Xin Ya was from No. 171, hanging the limit board. Later, after Nos. 224, 186, 116, 85, 234, 73, 106, 167, and 14 were sold, it fell back to 245 yuan. US-Asia was also hanging the limit board by Nos. 40 and 95. Nos. 76, 54, 207, 89, 97, 56, and 12 entered to 253 yuan.

After 10 o'clock, Nos. 223, 224, 232, 76, 160, 94, and 218 came to sell. It was said that the foreign exchange market price was listed at 35,000 yuan and 38,000 yuan. The interest rate outside the market was as high as 18% and 22.5%. People began to feel depressed, and Yong yarn fell to 246 yuan. Nos. 45, 218, 89, 117, 36, 148, 223, 85, and 225 sold out, and No. 130 sold spot Yong yarn, falling to 240 yuan. Nos. 218, 56, and 197 absorbed some, and there was still maintenance.

After 10:30, rumors spread that the foreign exchange market price was listed as low as 33,000 yuan and 35,000 yuan. People's hearts were greatly afraid, and Xin Ya China Silk US-Asia also reported a pullback. Nos. 117, 36, 16, 104, 76, 14, 12, and 73 sold out, and No. 98 tried to sell spot Yong yarn, falling to the low prices of 234 yuan and 235 yuan. Nos. 218 and 207 absorbed at low prices, and there was a slight rebound. However, people's minds were already afraid, and there was a lot of panic, and the stimulus outside the industry was dim. Nos. 160, 235, 223, 153, 22, 219, 103, 224, 17, and 12 all closed out, and Nos. 45 and 32 also sold spot Yong yarn. The price fell to the low prices of 224 yuan for immediate delivery and 226 yuan for deferred delivery at the close. The noon closing was 225 yuan and 227 yuan.

The post-closing call price was still flat. As a result, compared with Saturday's immediate delivery stocks, US-Asia rose by 50%, China Silk rose by 100%, Jinglun rose by 50%, Xinhua fell by 50%, and so did Yong yarn. Qinxing was flat, and Xinguang Jingfu Zhongfa Yonggong Underwear Business Tongyi Rongfeng slightly fell. Zhongfang Datong Huafeng Wuhe Liann Xin Ya slightly rose. The deferred delivery stocks were set to rise by 50% for US-Asia, and Huafeng Yonggong slightly rose. Xinguang Yong yarn Jingfu slightly fell, and Qinxing was flat. Outside the market, old stocks such as Dasheng Nanyang and Wuzhou rose by 50%, Zhabei Huashang slightly fell, Shijie Pudong slightly rose, and the rest were stable.

### Food Oil is Prohibited from Transshipment in Various Places

Director Zhang Agreed to Telegraph the Customs to Comply

Recently, food oil has begun to move again, and the Chang Bureau is very concerned. In order to prevent smuggling abroad, a temporary emergency meeting was held at the Central Bank President Zhang's residence this morning. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, Grain Section Chief Ji Mingqi, and the People's Food Allocation Committee's Ren Xianqun attended. President Zhang presided over the meeting. The meeting discussed the policy of suppressing food oil, and immediately resolved that, in order to eradicate transshipment smuggling and loss of foreign exchange, from today onwards, all food oil in the country is not allowed to be transshipped, and a telegram was immediately sent to the President of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing for instructions. President Zhang agreed to immediately telegraph the Jianghai Customs Tax Office to immediately order the local customs to comply.

### New Early Rice Sales Are Balanced

Yesterday, a total of over 7,400 shi of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. The market situation was characterized by frequent price increases in the interior. Early and late season rice continued to increase by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. However, the market softened at the noon close. High-quality white rice was still rare and remained strong at 10,000 yuan. The arrival and sales of new early rice were balanced, and there were no immediate fluctuations. New Jiashan early glutinous rice and Pingwang new Sichuan rice have arrived in Shanghai. New Puzhen early rice has also arrived in Shanghai. New Liyang early rice continues to arrive, but the long-term outlook for early rice is not optimistic.

Wheat flour rose slightly by 1,000 yuan, and foreign flour rose gradually by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran was in high demand, especially from Taiwan, with prices soaring by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales remained sluggish, with a slight increase of 1,000 yuan. A continuous supply of Changjiang yellow soybeans arrived, and some new Changzhou cowhide yellow soybeans also arrived. Shantou factories, with cake and oil prices remaining stable, were very tight on pricing, raising prices slightly by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Mung beans from Nanyang were carefully selected at a high price, rebounding by 10,000 yuan, while medium-grade beans were priced fairly.

Red beans remained temporarily stable. Field peas were actively traded. Both supply and demand for sorghum were scarce, maintaining a firm price. Sesame seeds were tight, rebounding by 10,000 yuan. Foreign merchants modestly procured raw peanuts, with prices continuing to rise by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while medium-grade peanuts were priced fairly. Poor-quality rice saw an increase in new supply, but prosperity was not easy to achieve. Broad beans were not selling well in the local market, with prices falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. However, there was still trade among merchants from other provinces for white broad beans, remaining firm.

The oil market implemented a ban on re-exports, and merchants from other provinces ceased trading. However, local shops remained active, and raw oil remained firm. Soybean oil initially rose but then declined, netting an increase of over 10,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil mirrored this trend. Sesame oil, however, saw a shift to stagnant sales, with prices dropping by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

### Hangzhou Rice Prices Rise

[Report from our Hangzhou office, 18th] Commodity prices in Hangzhou have also been rising recently. Door sales of white rice are at 390,000, high-end glutinous rice is at 460,000, and new grain has also reached 320,000. Sugar prices have increased by 100,000 per grade. While the rise is not dramatic, the public is already uneasy.

### National Bonds Slightly Decline, Foreign Stocks Weak and Flat

Government bonds yesterday, amidst buyer disappointment, formed a situation of supply exceeding demand. Room 555 and 538 bought in, while room 360, 552, and 503 sold out. Unified bonds opened in the morning at 122,800 yuan, reaching a high of 130,000 yuan, and a low of 116,000 yuan, eventually hovering around 120,000 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, A, B, C, and E each fell by 700 yuan, and Unified D dropped by 600 yuan, with a transaction volume of approximately 5-6 million.

Foreign stocks also initially strengthened yesterday before declining. Although the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate was not finalized until 12:00 noon, starting from 10:00 am there were various rumors in the market that triggered extensive profit-taking. Securities firms, foreign merchants, and many retail investors took profits. While exchange firms and Guangdong merchants entered the market, the supply side was strong. Yisha opened in the morning at 96,000 yuan, but quickly fell to 88,000 yuan before stabilizing slightly. Compared to last Saturday, shipping declined by half a percent, Yeguang rose slightly, and the remainder were flat, weak, and slightly down.

### Soap and Matches Soar

Yesterday, the market for daily necessities continued to surge upon opening. The industrial raw materials included in the foreign exchange management regulations are all settled at current market prices, causing unusual excitement and eager buying in the market. The asking prices of various goods jumped sharply, especially Huang Xiangmao, which increased significantly. As a result, it rose by 23,000 yuan per box compared to last Saturday, reaching 360,000 yuan. Gu Ben soap rose by 10,000, and Arrow and Knife soap rose by 13,000, both reaching 490,000 yuan. Guanghua soap rose by 10,000, reaching 350,000 yuan. The remaining Henry, Dingfeng, and Cow Brand soaps rose by varying amounts of 5,000 to 10,000.

The match market was also very brisk. Familiar brands, such as Beauty and Phoenix, sold very well, with prices soaring by 100,000 yuan per box, reaching 3,150,000 yuan. The remaining new brands, such as Nanjing, Ningbo, Liming, and Rose, also ranged from 30,000-50,000 to 70,000-80,000 yuan.

### Cigarette Prices Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the cigarette market saw strong demand and limited supply, driving prices up sharply. Ten-cigarette packs of Great Britain cigarettes reached 12 million yuan before any transactions took place, with buyers competing for purchases and running out of stock. Prices then rose again to 2.3 million yuan. Due to the high prices, the market softened in the afternoon as profits were taken, and the price of ten-cigarette packs of Great Britain cigarettes fell back to 11.7 million yuan, but still sharply up by 700,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Old Knife cigarettes also rose by 200,000, reaching 8.63 million yuan. The price of strip cigarettes of Chinese brands, such as Beauty Golden Mouse, Million Gold, White Semi-Krees, and Red Gold, also rose by 500 to 2,600 yuan. The prices of strip cigarettes of American brands, such as Six More, Camel, and Morris, and 50-cigarette tins, also rose by varying amounts of 1,500 to 4,500 yuan.

### Zhejiang Salt Yard Warehouse Prices

[Report from our Hangzhou office, 18th] After the government increased salt taxes, the warehouse prices of various Zhejiang salt yards also increased. Yuyao Yard is 14,730 yuan, and Hangzhou Yard is 176,730 yuan. The door sales price in Hangzhou is 189,100 yuan per dan wholesale, and 2,050 yuan per jin retail. Wen Salt is 44,730 yuan per dan.

### The Issue of Rayon Allocation Prices Has Been Initially Resolved, and a Decision Can Be Made After Today's CITC Meeting

[Report from our publication] Representatives of silk weaving and ribbon weaving industries from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and other places, who petitioned in Beijing regarding the rayon allocation price issue, have now all returned to Shanghai, and the results are gradually approaching resolution.

Yesterday morning, the representatives returned to the CITC for formal discussions, where they were received by Director Wu. Director Wu first stated that there was absolutely no prejudice regarding the rayon allocation price. The principles were to increase national treasury revenue while taking into account industrial and commercial production. However, based on the principle of the Executive Yuan's allocation of materials not being lower than 80%, he hoped that the representatives would accept the 80% allocation price, so as to make up for the previous three periods based on the then-current market price. Cai Xin and Qian Xubao, representatives of the silk weaving industry, respectively stated the difficulties faced by the silk weaving industry, hoping that the CITC would greatly reduce the price to maintain this national industry. After two hours of discussion, in a spirit of mutual consultation and understanding, both sides had a deep understanding of their respective difficulties. Finally, the representatives requested that the rayon be temporarily allocated and sold at 70% of the market price, and that any excess or shortfall be compensated after the final decision. Director Wu accepted this request and agreed to consider it. It is planned to be submitted to today's CITC meeting for discussion and decision, so the issue of rayon allocation prices can be resolved.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Explanation - Maternal Grandmother Oversteps Authority, Accepts Betrothal Gifts and Arranges Marriage

Dear Editor, Ms. A, a friend, is 19 years old and her parents have passed away. When she was 16, her maternal grandmother arranged a marriage for her with Mr. B from the same village without obtaining Ms. A's consent. At the time of the engagement, a betrothal gift of 50,000 yuan was received from Mr. B. Later, Ms. A came to Shanghai to work due to living conditions. Recently, she met Mr. C (currently 25 years old) and the two fell in love at first sight and talked about marriage and spending their lives together. However, Ms. A is hindered by the existing engagement. May I ask: (1) Is the marriage contract arranged by Ms. A's maternal grandmother without her consent legally valid? (2) If Ms. A intends to terminate the previous contract, does she need to publish a statement in the newspaper, and will this affect the family? How should the gifts and betrothal gifts be repaid? (3) What should be done if Mr. B does not agree to terminate the contract? (4) What should be done if Mr. B makes indecent extortion from Ms. A? (5) Is it legal for Ms. A to directly engage with Mr. C?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin's Reply] (1) Minors must obtain the consent of their legal guardians to enter into a marriage contract. Her maternal grandmother is not her legal guardian, and has no right to arrange a marriage contract. Since Ms. A did not consent to the engagement at the time, it is naturally invalid. (2) Since the marriage contract was arranged by a non-legal guardian, it is fundamentally invalid and there is no need to publish a statement in the newspaper. The gifts received by her maternal grandmother should still be refunded by her. (3) If Mr. B does not agree to terminate the marriage contract, he can simply be ignored. (4) Mr. B may not demand compensation for damages from Ms. A. (5) It is permitted by law for the parties to enter into a marriage contract themselves.

Spring and Autumn

### Lady Gregory's Diary

— Zhao Jingshen

Aside from obvious formal differences, in what ways can a famous writer's diary surpass biographies and autobiographies? There are three key distinctions. First, diaries can reveal the writer's relationships with many contemporary authors, naturally discussing everyday events. Second, diaries can unconsciously (or largely unconsciously) convey the author's own personality. Third, and perhaps most fundamentally, writing a diary should not be done with publication in mind. One must not be afraid to offend people, and write freely. This makes it appear genuine and allows the writer to say what they need to say without selection, without hypocritical pretense, and with more mature judgment. Furthermore, unlike biographies and autobiographies, it is written in a disorganized and spontaneous manner.

These strengths and weaknesses can be seen in "Lady Gregory's Journals." Lady Gregory was the mother of modern Irish drama, while Shaw was the father of modern Irish drama. Gregory and Shaw were closely related, as often seen in the diary, but she rarely appears as a central figure. The editor of this diary, Lennox Robinson, wrote in the preface about Shaw: "The two were so close in friendship and work that she did not need to accurately record his conversations and thoughts." In the entire 340-page book, Shaw is only mentioned on eight pages.

The development of Gregory's personality is quite endearing. "She loved her house at Coole, and despite the disasters, she always wanted to preserve the house and pass it down to her grandchildren without damage. She had strong political independence, was revolutionary and opposed the government, but at the same time, she was full of jealousy, sympathy, and prejudice. She loved the Irish people but lacked systematic theory. She devoted many years of effort to the Abbey Theatre." The last sentence of the book is: "Sometimes I think my life is a series of passions."

Robinson used a classification method to compile this book, roughly dividing it into six categories, with about a quarter of the material not used. The classification is not very good, and one can often find places that should be included in other categories, and all categories are not easily included. We feel that it is better to use a chronological order, only needing to list the index of names and places in detail at the end of the book.

The diary spans from 1916 to 1930. Each category has a preface by Robinson. Readers would probably want to see the Abbey Theatre category first. This category is very interesting, but the time constraints are unfortunate. There is not much new historical data on the theater's early growth, but it is described in great detail about Sean O'Casey. She said that he began his literary life with "Shadow of a Gunman," became famous for "Juno and the Paycock," described dissolute women in "The Plough and the Stars," and presented "the pain of loud quarrels" in "Silver Tassie." Because it is Irish, the spelling of "Paycock" and "Tassie" are different from English.

Other categories describe the horror of the civil war, Shaw's appearance, and several good stories.

Gregory's own pride was that she had encouraged O'Casey. She said, "Your strength is character portrayal."

The diary also mentioned Waller Macken's "Mungo's Mansion," with a seaside setting and a style as simple as John Synge. The structure of this play is very relaxed and is a good comedy. The general idea is that Mungo has long had a desire to buy a new, magnificent mansion in the suburbs. Just as he won a large sum of money by buying horse racing tickets and using his house as collateral; but at this point, he only wanted to live in a humble house.

Therefore, it seems that the truth should be revealed. Mr. Xie Bingji's "Tenderness" was written eighteen years ago, and it was indeed published eighteen years ago. Perhaps because the book was a bestseller for a while, the so-called Huazhong Publishing House mistakenly changed the author "Xie Bingji" to "Xie Bingying."

I met Mr. Xie Bingying once at a literary tea party, but I have no relationship with Mr. Xie Bingji. To be fair, terms like "despicable," "vulgar," and "extremely boring" are too much of an injustice to Mr. Xie Bingji. If the author of "Tenderness" from eighteen years ago is still alive today (of course, I hope he is), he would probably be confused!

One thing I find strange and puzzling is that Mr. Xie Bingying said that the cover of the book was printed with "1946 Shanghai Huazhong Publishing House." In 1946, Japan had already surrendered, and the enemy puppets had already been captured or fled. How could it be 1946?

In China today, everything is sluggish, but the most sluggish is the literary world. Plagiarism, rehashes, misattributions, and other malpractices are common. In particular, the translation of Western articles and magazines, as well as extracting paragraphs from someone's work to write scripts and make movies, is even more blatant. But, heaven knows, what can you do to stop it! Please tell me, what can you do to stop it!

Note: Three days after Ms. Xie Bingying's "Statement" was published, this article by Mr. Ge Chunliang was received, along with a copy of Xie Bingji's "Tenderness" (January 1935, third edition). A letter from Mr. Feng Shumei was also received, with largely the same content. In addition to forwarding the book and letter to Ms. Bingying, I also find it puzzling why the publications of enemy and puppet publishing organizations were still being reprinted last year (1946)? Have the local authorities in charge of publishing paid attention to such matters? Should publishing organizations also assume the responsibility of inspection and supervision? This is truly a problem for the Chinese publishing industry today. (Editor)

Response to Ms. Xie Bingying's "Statement"

After reading Ms. Xie Bingying's "Statement" in Spring and Autumn a few days ago, I couldn't help but go to that pile of books, which I had already set aside, and retrieve that book. The title of the book is "Tenderness," the "Tenderness" of "Warmth is the warmth of temperature, and tenderness is the tenderness of softness."

My copy of "Tenderness" was published by Daguang Bookstore, and it says that it is the third edition in November of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). The table of contents also includes the two articles "First Time Receiving Tenderness from the Opposite Sex" and "Moon," as well as three other articles: "The Death of Pan Qiaoyun," "Execution Ground," and "Old Five." But the name of the author is "Xie Bingji." It also contains a preface by Mr. Shen Congwen, with the end of the preface writing "Shen Congwen, in Shanghai, autumn of the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929)."

As for the so-called "Shanghai Huazhong Publishing House," there is no need to investigate or punish it according to the law. I apologize, but I am not defending the bastard publishing house, it is really not worth it. Because that was Shanghai during the occupation period, a masterpiece of the Japanese devils.

### Miscellaneous Poems of a Taiwan Tour

— Gu Yiqiao

Sun Moon Lake

One

Sun and moon's brilliance, a lake for all ages,
In the sound of pestle songs, the dance is lively;
Mount Jade beyond the sky, a Wushan dream,
Seem to hear plantain in the night rain talking.

Two

Around the lake, Hanbi's green spreads the breeze,
Sun and moon's brilliance, a lake for all ages;
Misty temples and cloud hair, ever-changing,
East Sea's sound, old southern sky.

Three

Only learn from Yi and Qi's fern diet,
Move the troops across the sea to explore Chihkan;
After the departure of the Red Hairs, the rivers and mountains are good,
Sun and moon's brilliance, a lake for all ages.

Pestle Song

High mountains and flowing water, beyond the white clouds,
There is another Peach Blossom Spring, difficult to cross at night;
A little telepathy communicates with wood and stone,
In the heart of the lake, clearly pestle sounds cold.

Caoshan

Build a hut on Caoshan, lecturing in the forest; (Linjian College)
Insects sing the autumn sound fu, fishing songs in Tamsui Bay;
Geese and gulls far away on the sandy isles,
Tides return to the sea and sky;
Occasionally recalling Yangming's teachings, (Yangming Villa)
Knowing it is difficult to act, but still hard.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of River, An Inch of Blood 380

— Ye Jinfeng

The second and third outposts were similar, so Yaoqun was relieved and went straight to the fourth outpost. It was already around two o'clock in the morning. Yaoqun understood the situation, knowing that the preceding "hitmen" had passed by here around eleven o'clock and had gone to scout the fifth outpost. They had also left a message, preparing to go directly to the old village from the fifth outpost; if everything was fine along the way, they did not plan to return.

The Northeast, this "land of abundance" outside the Pass, had long become a piece of fat meat for these two powers before the Russo-Japanese War, with them openly and secretly fighting over it. At that time, our country's "authorities" were muddle-headed and regarded this vast fertile land as a rocky field, unable to take care of it, or rather, unable to do so. The local people had no choice but to survive on their own, organizing some "mutual assistance" villages to protect their ancestral tombs.

Afterward, during the seven or eight years when the Russian army was about to be defeated at Sunji, they suddenly occupied Fengtian, triggering the Russo-Japanese War. This forced the local people to live in constant fear, knowing that no matter which of these two rogues won, the three eastern provinces would be ravaged. The leaders of the larger villages, who were more powerful, intensified their unity between these two powers, seeking self-preservation. Until the Japanese ousted the Tsarist Russian forces (only partially, with the rest temporarily lurking and fighting in secret), and the Republic of China was also restored, the warlords became kings outside the Pass. Those self-defense organizations that had some reputation could not withstand the impact of the two powers, one overt and one covert. Some "submitted" to the "government," while others evolved into another kind of organization, still living a life of struggle. For a glimmer of hope, they did not hesitate to risk their lives to fight against the three greedy wolves.

After the "September 18th Incident," the Japanese openly occupied the Northeast, and the situation changed drastically. However, except for the points and lines, and the outer areas of these points and lines, those groups that had originally been fighting, plus some who had "submitted" and then "rebelled," continued to guard their villages in the white mountains and black waters, struggling hard. Those who suffered the ravages and poisoning of the Japanese were only within the point and line areas, with most unable to escape. Of course, there were also some "whoever comes is fine, as long as there is food to eat" "Shen kinds."

Of course, these "village chiefs" who were each governing themselves had no united system, could not cooperate seamlessly, and could not share a common hatred and unite against foreign enemies. Sometimes, they fell for the enemy's spies and engaged in the despicable act of selling out their friends. Some did it for a mine, some for a deal, some for a mountain, and some even for a casual grudge, inevitably leading to a kind of mutual self-destruction.

### A History of Western Fans

— Chen Lunqing

The oldest Western fan that has been preserved to this day belongs to Queen Theodolinda of the sixth century Lombard, and is now kept in the Catholic Church of Monza near Milan, Italy. Archaeologists regard it as a treasure, and the fan is kept in the same place as the Queen's crown.

The earliest mention of fans in Western ancient literature can be found in the play "Helena" by the famous Greek playwright Euripides (born in 480 BC, died in 406 BC). The play has a eunuch character who describes how to use a fan to fan the face of the heroine and change it.

Roman noblewomen used fans made of sandalwood, which were held by accompanying servants.

In the Middle Ages in the West, the upper class used fans made of the feathers of birds such as peacocks, parrots, and pheasants, and were decorated with gold chains on their belts as ornaments. Most of them were made by Turkish and Moroccan craftsmen, passed through Venice, and sold throughout the markets of Eastern Europe.

It is said that the first fan in France was brought to France by Queen Catherine de Medici, queen of King Henry II of France, in 1560 AD (387 years ago). For a time, it was imitated up and down, becoming a fashion. Not only women used it as an ornament, but also a group of feminine men used fans in social occasions. Ten years later, the fan spread from France to England. At that time, Queen Elizabeth was in power in England, and it was a time of cultural enlightenment. The fan also served as an embellishment in the civilized society of that time.

### Fans in Europe

— Lota

Japan, Korea, and China are the originators of the fan!

Based on shape, fans can be divided into three types: round fans, folding fans, and flag fans. Round fans have the longest history and widest distribution, being popular in ancient China, Egypt, Greece, and India, though the materials used varied.

Speaking of folding fans, we must acknowledge the Japanese as their originators. The folding fan was invented in the 7th century AD, passed from Korea to China, and then introduced to Europe by the Portuguese in the 15th century.

"Flag fans," as the name suggests, are shaped like flags, with the handle not in the center of the fan but on the side. This fan was once popular in 16th-century Italy, but it was soon eliminated due to its inconvenience.

It is said that the Chinese invented the fan in 6000 BC. Bamboo strips and palm leaves were the main materials for making fans, while more elaborate fans used silk, pheasant, and peacock feathers. After the Japanese folding fan was introduced to China, the Chinese began to use precious ivory, sandalwood, and pearls to make fans, adding exquisite carvings and paintings, thus increasing the fan's "value a hundredfold!"

The Japanese invention of the folding fan symbolizes the "flower of life," and the shape implies "promoting and developing." Japanese folding fans come in many varieties, including butterfly shapes, dance fans with twelve wisteria tendrils attached, and folding fans with iron frames, black paper, and red or golden sun, moon, and stars. Among these, the "tea fan" is the most special, with only three ribs and a very simple design. In ancient times, people across Japan held tea parties on the first day of each month to celebrate, and waving fans was not allowed at these gatherings; tea fans were used to pass tea cakes around the table.

In the courts of ancient Egypt, fan makers held high positions, and their products were very precious. The fan leaves were made of gold leaf or ostrich feathers in a semi-circular shape, with a long handle that was gold on one side and ebony inlaid with gold on the other.

Greek and Roman fans were mostly made of peacock feathers and were far less exquisite than Egyptian fans. These fans can only be seen in the images on pottery of the time.

Fans in medieval Europe were often related to religion. For example, the "Flabellum" was a type of fan used in churches to drive away flies and insects from the Eucharist, with fan leaves made of silver and a very long handle. Another type of fan had a vellum fan face and an ivory handle. There was also a leather fan used by the papal guard during papal processions in medieval Rome.

After the introduction of the 16th-century Japanese folding fan to Europe by the Portuguese, a major revolution occurred in the European "fan world." The folding fan spread from Spain to Italy, from Italy to France, and from France to England, conquering all in its path. The aforementioned Italian "flag fan" was the first to be eliminated.

Europe became the world of fans in the 17th century. Paris was the center of the fan industry at the time, and Louis XIV issued many fan-making decrees, establishing a fan-making guild in 1638. However, after the revocation of the famous Edict of Nantes in 1685, fan makers who adhered to Protestantism could not establish themselves in the country and fled to England and Holland. The British fan-making company was established in 1709, at a time when the import of foreign fans, especially those from China and India, was once banned. During this period, the shape of the fan expanded from oblong to oval.

The 18th century was the peak of the European fan industry, and Chinese fan makers were invited overseas to design fans. Exquisitely carved ivory was the main material for making fans, sometimes inlaid with gold, silver, enamel, and pearls. Sometimes, high-quality silk was used for the fan face, and famous artists were commissioned to paint the scenes.

"Everything reaches an extreme and then reverses," and even the fate of fans was no exception. Although fans in the early 18th century were very precious, they were not very practical and were only used as decorations. By the late 18th century, the focus of fan making was on practicality and durability. The handles were not carved, the fan faces were mostly made of thick paper, and the scenes depicted were often realistic. For example, the successful test of the hot air balloon in 1785 and the French Estates-General of 1789 were both depicted.

In the 19th century, European fans, apart from the overly romantic atmosphere of the scenes during the Victorian era in England, had no new designs.

### ### Casual Chats About Fans for Cooling Off

— Sun Hu

In the summer evenings, under melon trellises and bean frames, in breezy pavilions with cool mats, set out a pot of wine, a pot of tea... waving a fan to invite coolness, drawing in wisps of wind, and the residual heat of the scorching sun vanishes like smoke and clouds. That kind of taste is what makes it so delightful.

Speaking of ordinary fans, they are roughly divided into: "round fans," "folding fans," "palm leaf fans," and "feather fans," among several types. Poets and refined scholars often express themselves through them in their verses, which is frequently seen. For example, Du Mu's "Light silk small fan catching fireflies" - referring to a kind of light silk fan as thin as cicada wings - Su Dongpo's "Nian Nu Jiao" poem's "Feather fan and silk turban, chatting and laughing" - that is the goose feather fan held gracefully as if to ascend to immortality - Li Jiayou's poem "The south wind doesn't need a palm leaf fan" - the palm leaf fan, commonly known as the banana leaf fan - and Fan Chengda's "Round fan in the wind, all green scents." Lu You's "Round fans, every household writes 'Fangweng'." Wang Jian's "Tune Laughter Order" poem, "Round fan, national fan, beauties come to cover their faces," - that antique national fan, famous scholars and beauties, heroic children, how many stories of joys and sorrows are acted out through it.

Regarding the enduring charm of fans, it is scattered throughout old books, reading which is quite interesting. I have excerpted a few passages below:

(Zhang Yanchang's Feather Fan Manual) ""Ancient and Modern Notes"" reads that the viewing of it originated with Jiaogao. Zhou Tengjin wrote an entire military strategy on it, and commentators say it was only used for ceremonial guards. It wasn't until the time of the Three Kingdoms, when Zhuge Liang held a white feather fan to command the three armies, that the current defensive use of feather fans was revealed. Its production flourished in Huzhou... the bird feathers used are not uniform, but goose feathers are the most common."

White feather fans, now goose feather fans, imitate this style. Because they were favored by Zhuge Wuhou and used to command the three armies, even a small fan becomes almost magical!

(Wang Xizhi's Biography) Xizhi was at Bamboo Mountain when he saw an old woman selling hexagonal bamboo fans. Xizhi wrote five characters on each fan, and the old woman was displeased. So he said, "Just say it's calligraphy by Wang Youjun, and ask for a hundred coins!" She did as he said, and people competed to buy them.

(Jin Shu: Biography of Xie An) A commoner from Longzhong County returned to visit An. An asked about his travel expenses? He replied: "I have fifty thousand palm leaf fans." An then took one of the better ones and held it, and the price in the capital increased several times.

When Yuan Yanbo of Jin was appointed to guard Danyang, Xie An sent him off with a fan. Yanbo said, "I will carefully promote your benevolent wind and comfort those common people."

As for the folding fans that long-gowned gentlemen are accustomed to lightly waving, their ancient name is Jutou fan (Gathering Head Fan). Their production originated in Goryeo. The Chinese of the Song dynasty already enjoyed using them, and at that time, steamed bamboo was used for the ribs, sandwiched with silk and damask; wealthy families used ivory for the ribs, decorated with gold and silver. (Qiu Yuanwei's Remarks) "During the Yuan dynasty, Goryeo used this as tribute, and it only became popular in China during the Yongle reign of the Ming dynasty. During the Xuande and Hongzhi reigns, Li Zhao and Ma Xun were both famous for making fans." It is said that starting from the late Ming dynasty, the fashion of folding fans became prevalent among scholars.

In addition, there are several types of ancient fans, specially made, that are not commonly seen by us, for example:

Five Brightness Fan: (Ancient and Modern Notes) The Five Brightness Fan was made by Shun. When Shun received the abdication, he opened his vision and hearing wide, seeking wise men to assist himself, so he made the Five Brightness Fan. Dukes, ministers, scholars, and officials of the Qin and Han dynasties could all use it, but those who were not virtuous or had usurped their positions could not.

Nine Flower Fan: Cao Zhi's Preface to the Nine Flower Fan Fu says: "In the past, my late father often served as an attendant, and was favored by Emperor Huan of the Han, who bestowed a bamboo species from Shangfang that was neither square nor round, in which a pattern was formed, called the 'Nine Flowers'." The fu says:

"The shape is five separated and nine folded, the bamboo strips untangled and divided; imitating the winding of tadpoles and dragons, following the misty aura of rainbows; the furnace is based on the subtle and lasts through time, forming the flower pattern of the nine cycles."

Fragrant Cattail Fan: (Materia Medica) A fan made from fragrant cattails. Soft, smooth, and lightweight, it is extremely suitable for use.

In summary: the fan is not only a necessity for daily use in the summer, but its elegant and refined aspects have also long been renowned in the literary world.

### ### Anecdotes About Fans

— Jia Guanjun

Fan Powder: Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang: On the summer solstice, women in the Northern Qi dynasty all presented fan powder and grease pouches.

Fan Market: Qinzhong Annual Records: Two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, the East Market is called the Fan Market, with exceptionally crowded carriages and horses.

Snow Fragrance Fan: Qingyi Records: Meng Chang used a water-infused dragon brain rice mixture to coat white fans in the summer months, using them to create wind, calling them Snow Fragrance Fans.

Ice Gauze Fan: Langhuan Records: A woman gifted Shen Xiuwen with several taels of intertwined silk, saying: "This is called ice silk, given to you to make an ice gauze fan." Shen later wove it into gauze, which was fresh, clean, and bright, no different from ice. Made into a fan, when carried in hand during the summer, it would be cool without fanning.

Crimson Magpie Fan: Gleanings from History: In the twenty-fourth year of King Zhao of Zhou, the country of Tuixiu presented a pair of crimson magpies, male and female. During the fourth month of summer, the swans molted and changed their feathers, which were gathered to make fans. Two women presented by Eastern Ou were made to fan with these fans, and the light wind scattered, bringing coolness and freshness.

Red-Ridged Fan: Jade Sea: In the fourth month of the first year of Chunhua, the Emperor personally wrote in "flying white" calligraphy on red-striped fans and bestowed them to chancellors, privy councilors, academicians, ministers and vice-ministers, and officials above the rank of secretariat, each one.

Dragon Skin Fan: Lost Tales of Kaiyuan: Wang Yuanbao's family possessed a leather fan. Every time he hosted guests in the hot months, he would place the fan in front of them and sprinkle it with fresh water, and a clear breeze would immediately blow, bringing a chill to the room. Therefore, they would order it to be removed. Emperor Ming once sent a eunuch to retrieve it for examination, saying: "This is a dragon skin fan."

Flowered Fan: Tang and Song Anecdotes: People in the capital competed to make elaborate flowered fans on the fifth day of the fifth month.

Fan Used to Predict the Weather: Book of Sui: Xin Du Fang, a military advisor in the Later Qi dynasty, made twenty-four wheel fans and buried them in the ground to measure the twenty-four solar terms. When one solar term was sensed, that fan would move automatically, while the other fans remained still.

Fan Decorated with Feathers and Paintings: Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital: The Emperor used feather fans in the summer and painted fans in the winter.

Bestowal of Imperially Inscribed Fans: Jade Sea: On the ninth day of the fourth month of the first year of Shaoxing, imperial calligraphy fans were bestowed to reading attendants Wang Hu Zhi and Hu Jiaoxiu.

Flying White Phoenix Fan: Book of Tang: On the fifth day of the fifth month, Emperor Taizong bestowed fans with flying white egrets and phoenixes on Changsun Wuji and others.

The above are all seen in the Monthly Ordinances; they are specifically extracted here for reference.

### ### Fan Examinations

— Pengzi

Different types of fans have different origins. From historical records, we can get a general idea. The folding fan, which is the most common type today, is also called the pleated fan. It is also called the "spreading fan" because it opens when used. The oldest name is "gathering head fan." There are two theories about its origin. From the Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance, "When Chu Yuan returned to court, he used a waist fan to shield the sun. Hu Sansheng's note: 'The waist fan is worn on the waist, and people today call it the folding fan.'" Another theory is that it was tribute from the Eastern Yi during the early Ming Dynasty, and imitated during the Yongle reign, as argued by Liu Yuanqing and Chen Jiru of the Ming Dynasty. The silk fan, also called the round fan, was called "Yimian" in ancient times. It only existed in the Han Dynasty. The History of the Han Dynasty has "Use Yimian to attach a horse." Note: "Yimian is used to cover the face, like a painted fan. Not wanting to be seen, this is used to cover the face, so it is called Yimian, also called Screen Face." Today, the bamboo fan used by monks, wide and flat at the top and round at the bottom, is this type. Unfortunately, it has changed from its original shape, and the ancient meaning is completely lost. The palm fan, anciently called Yizong fan, already existed in the Jin Dynasty. However, it is generally called a banana leaf fan today, which is actually incorrect. According to the Notes from the Two Kinds of Autumn Rain Studio, "The new Yi County of Guangdong produces palm fans. The palm is not a banana. Poets often write about banana fans in their poems, but banana leaves cannot actually be made into fans, so it is not the same thing. Moreover, the ancients only spoke of palm fans. I don't know how it became corrupted into 'banana' fan." Feather fans, it is said, existed as early as the Zhou Dynasty. They were made from red magpies and goose hands presented as tribute from foreign lands. The goose feather fan is a type of feather fan. Times are constantly changing, and fans are also constantly changing. Talking about the present and the past gives people endless feelings.

### ### Two Poems on Fans

— Zhao Bingwen

Inscription on a Gathering Fan for a Bureau Official in the Imperial Court

Carried into the Purple Palace in the early morning,
Daily use all within your grasp.
To operate the pivot is a true skill,
Rolled and hidden in your sleeve, uncomplaining.
In the imperial court, the long day passes leisurely,
A slight coolness in the water palace at the end of the banquet.
I wish to use this small tool to regulate the pure feast,
May the benevolent voice spread, stirring the wind of Shun's zither.

Palm Fan

A single layer of dragon scales leans against half the sky,
Embraced in the hand, it brings a natural breeze.
The mountain spirit clings to the ancient wood,
The fiery spirit fans the flames with its red tail.
Where is the distant green phoenix beyond a thousand miles,
Once, a white feather swept through the air.
It should be here, by the water and on the stones,
Providing relief to the ailing old man with lung disease and his elaborate fan. (Selected and edited by Wu Xinghong)

Note: Zhao Bingwen, a Yuan Dynasty person, was nicknamed the Idle Old Man and wrote the Collected Works of the Fushui.

### ### The Personification of Fans

— Yu Ying

Humanity's earliest two major inventions—the fan and the umbrella—, like other garments and adornments, have finally journeyed from "practical" to "decorative." Bertrand Russell explains that the hallmark of a civilized society is: leisure. The more developed a nation's culture, the more adept its men and women will be at adorning themselves. To put it more bluntly, literature, art, and the like are all products of leisure. From a small palace fan or a little floral umbrella, one can glean the extent of a nation's cultural development.

Precisely because the practical value of fans and umbrellas has gradually depreciated while their decorative value has gradually increased, fans and umbrellas often represent a portion of their owner's personality. Neville Chamberlain always appeared with his umbrella. When Chamberlain appointed himself the executor of the policy of appeasement, in the eyes of keen cartoonists, the umbrella almost became the symbol of "the policy of appeasement." After London was bombed by German planes, someone suggested: Why doesn't Chamberlain send planes to drop parasols on Berlin? If Chamberlain had been regularly carrying a fan instead of an umbrella, I believe the editorials and cartoons about fans in European and American newspapers and magazines before 1939 would have greatly increased.

"The Personification of Fans" could, in fact, be written as a monograph. For instance, Queen Victoria especially loved to go shopping for small ornaments like fans or hats. In Queen Victoria's hands, was the purpose of the fan merely to "cool off"? And then there is the goose-feather fan, which cannot be separated from Zhuge Liang for even a moment. "Since Liang was born, there has been a fan," as if Kongming emerged from his mother's womb already carrying a goose-feather fan. If, by chance, the Kongming on stage forgot to bring his fan, the audience would surely become restless. There is no other reason for this except that a small goose-feather fan can strongly emphasize Kongming's leisurely nature and exaggerate his unhurried, reclusive demeanor. —Unless the Peking opera undergoes a major revolution, the idea of Kongming without a goose-feather fan is indeed unimaginable!

Behind Mrs. Erlynne's fan, the "heroine's fan" in "Lady Windermere's Fan," lies a story of blood and tears. Behind Yang Longyou's painting of Peach Blossom Spring lies a painful history of national subjugation before the fall of the Ming. By the same logic, one can understand the development of human culture by focusing on the changes and reforms of fans.
