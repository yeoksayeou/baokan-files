### National Army Holds Flag Raising Ceremony, Yan'an Residents Ecstatic, Communist Army Invading Southward from Guanzhong Area Defeated

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 20th] The National Army, having liberated Yan'an, held a flag-raising ceremony in the city center on the morning of the 20th, singing the national anthem. The huge national flag, with its blue sky, white sun, and crimson ground, soared high in the sky, and residents eagerly watched, beside themselves with joy.

[Further Telegram] The National Army, engaged in a counterattack, occupied Yan'an County on the morning of the 19th and immediately began to clear out the remaining Communist troops in the surrounding suburbs. By evening, they had successively occupied the three major barriers of Yan'an's suburbs: Qingliang Mountain (north of the county seat), Fenghuang Mountain (southwest of the county seat), and Saita Mountain (southeast of the county seat). The remaining Communist troops fled northeast and northwest, in complete disarray. The National Army pursued, and by the morning of the 20th, had reached Guaimao Town (25 li northeast of Yan'an). It is reported that the Yan'an Communist Army Headquarters and important personnel fled towards Suide and Wayaobao in the late hours of the 18th, in a state of utter disarray.

[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 20th] The first National Army troops to enter Yan'an were the 1st Division, an elite unit of Hu Zongnan's forces. Yan'an and the Yan River valley are now entirely under the control of the National Army. The National Army advancing northward has reached Yanchang and the suburbs of Anding.

[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 20th] The Communist troops retreating in disarray from Yan'an are currently scattered to the northeast and northwest. However, in the recovered area of 300 square kilometers, many villages and towns are almost entirely deserted. This is because when the Communist troops retreated, they forcibly organized able-bodied men into transport teams and stretcher teams, forcing them to withdraw with the army, regardless of the size of the town or village. Observers believe that the remaining Communists will soon cross the Yellow River at Suide and Wubu to minimize losses and retreat to the west. However, it is also possible that they will flee north beyond the Great Wall into Suiyuan and Outer Mongolia. The recent expansion of the Communist army in the Yimeng region to the border of Etuoke Banner may be a prelude to this move.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 20th] The He Long troops of the Communist army, invading southward from northern Shaanxi into Guanzhong, retreated into the Daxiaolaochu Mountains northwest of Ganquan after a valiant counterattack by the National Army. After a night of encirclement and suppression by the National Army, a fierce battle ensued. He Long's troops attempted to make a last stand in the Daxiaolao Mountains, but ultimately suffered heavy casualties and scattered in disarray on the night of the 19th. He Long also fled without a trace. The National Army immediately occupied the high ground in the mountainous area and was still clearing out the remaining Communist troops as of the morning of the 20th.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] According to reports received in the capital, the National Army launched a large-scale pincer offensive today, advancing north of Yan'an. At the same time, the National Army has also been deployed in Gansu Province to prevent the infiltration of Communist troops. The National Army in Yulin is cutting off the Communist troops' retreat route.

[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 20th] The county chiefs of Ganquan and Fushi have arrived in their respective county seats with the army to assist the Party and the nation in carrying out pacification work. The Yan'an airfield is being urgently repaired, and the runway is expected to be restored for takeoffs and landings by the 20th or 21st.

### If the Chinese Communists Abandon Armed Rebellion, the Government Will Cease Military Advance; Future Focus of War Will Be in Shandong and Shanxi; Chief of General Staff Chen Makes Statement to Reporters

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] After the National Army liberated Yan'an, Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at the Lizhi Society at 4:00 PM on the 20th. In response to inquiries, he clearly stated that if the Communist Party does not voluntarily abandon its weapons and its adopted policies of terror and various acts of sabotage, the government will resolutely use military force until a complete resolution is achieved. Chief of General Staff Chen said: The purpose of the government's capture of Yan'an this time is to seek peace and national unification. He pointed out that since the Political Consultative Conference, the Communist Party has been using the Political Consultative Conference on one hand, engaging in peace talks with the government in appearance, and on the other hand, using force to try to realize its conspiracy to seize power. Recently, it has not only refused peace talks and denied the National Constitution, but has also openly refused to recognize the treaties signed by the National Government with foreign countries. At the same time, it has mobilized its entire force, dispatching troops to attack in various directions, attempting to overthrow the National Government, and disregarding the interests of the nation. The government has reached the point where it can no longer tolerate it, and it cannot be resolved by political means, so it has no choice but to adopt military action. Yan'an is the Communist Party's command tower for issuing orders and the base for launching rebellions, so military action began on the 14th. Within five days, by 10:00 AM on the 19th, Yan'an was recovered to relieve the people from their suffering. Chief of General Staff Chen also elaborated on how Yan'an was recovered. He first stated that the Communist army's forces defending Yan'an included the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Training Brigades, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Guard Brigades, the 27th Cavalry Division, the New 8th Brigade, the New 9th Brigade, and the New 11th Brigade. In addition, He Long was transferred from Shanxi to gather the 120th Division, the 358th Brigade, the 359th Brigade, and the Independent 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Brigades, totaling three divisions and thirteen brigades. Together with the original militia, the number was no less than 160,000. With such a large force to "defend Great Yan'an," it was lost after only five days of fighting. This shows the exhaustion of the Communist army's combat effectiveness. More than 10,000 Communist troops were captured this time, most of whom surrendered voluntarily. This is one of the main reasons why the National Army was able to quickly recover Yan'an. Chen then declared that he would very much like to welcome reporters to Yan'an in the short term to see the truth. The Yan'an airfield has not yet been repaired, and whether to travel by air or by train will depend on the situation. Chief of General Staff Chen also said that he welcomes reporters to visit various battlefields in southern Shandong and central Shandong.

### Q&A with Reporters

After Chief of General Staff Chen's report, he allowed reporters to ask questions freely, which lasted until 6:00 PM. Here are the key points: (1) The Communist army is fleeing towards the northeast, possibly towards northwestern Shanxi. The National Army will continue to pursue them to the Yellow River. The focus of the war in the future may be in the Shandong and Shanxi areas. (2) The force of the National Army attacking Yan'an totaled five divisions. (3) A reporter asked, if the Communist army changes its attitude, can it be reorganized and become a part of the national army? Chief of General Staff Chen replied: More than 120,000 Communist troops have surrendered, and we have treated them very well. If there are surrenders, they will definitely be incorporated. 3,000 people in the National Army's 74th Division were reorganized from surrendered Communist troops. If there are those who want to return to their hometowns, they can also be sent home. If there are political workers who are responsible, they can be trained. Someone then asked how long it would take to completely defeat the Communist army. Chief of General Staff Chen said that we have been fighting and negotiating from the beginning. The war has only just begun. If we fight a real war, I believe we can defeat their main force within three months. It is still difficult to determine how long it will take to eliminate all the Communist troops. (4) Regarding the issue of opening up the Jinpu Railway, we did not originally intend to open up this line, but to contain its forces and search for the location of its main force. In addition to opening up transportation lines, there is also construction work, so it will take some time. However, the railway from Xuzhou to Yanzhou is expected to be repaired and open to traffic in April. (5) Someone asked what the government would do if Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, and others were arrested. Chief of General Staff Chen said that this would be decided by the people. (6) The issue of receiving Dalian involves both diplomatic and military aspects. (7) A foreign reporter asked whether the National Army can fight the Communist army without relying on foreign forces. He replied that it is possible. We can solve the Communist army without relying on foreign forces. He also said that even during the War of Resistance, we only received spiritual assistance. He believed that we can solve the Communist army with our own strength. In the Yan'an offensive, air force power was only used for reconnaissance and transportation. The weather has been bad in recent days, so there has been no action. (8) Someone asked whether all front-line troops in various battlefields would take the initiative to launch offensives in the future for the sake of suppressing the rebellion. Chen said that the key to application lies in one's mind. This is a matter for the future, so I cannot answer in advance. (9) Someone asked when the war could come to an end. Chief of General Staff Chen replied that this depends on the actions of the Communist Party. If the Communist army repents, voluntarily abandons its arms and terror policies, and its disruptive actions, so that the people can live and work in peace, then it can come to an end. Otherwise, we can only use force to the end. (10) Regarding the situation of military officers transferring to civilian jobs, the government had already formulated a plan since the victory and repatriation to enable the military to turn consumption into production. However, this plan has been disrupted by the Communist army, so only more than 80,000 people have been completed to date. Finally, Chen responded to a reporter's inquiry about whether the government will issue a punitive expedition order as follows: Attacking the Communist army and issuing a punitive expedition order are two different things. The Communist army has been abandoned by the people, and there is no need for it at present.

He also put forward several principles for raising the Party members' intellectual understanding of the ideology, strengthening the Party members' emotional bond of sharing the Party's joys and sorrows, strengthening the Party members' will to sacrifice and struggle for the country, the people, and the Party, improving the organization of Party committees at all levels, expanding the Party's activities in all aspects of society, strictly clarifying the examination and reward of Party members' success or failure in various aspects of work, and the Party's future status and style. He hoped that the entire assembly and all Party members would recognize the shortcomings, make proper long-term plans, and make timely remedies to seek the complete success of the National Revolution.

### Original Text of the Commendation Telegram

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Third Plenary Session passed a telegram on the 20th to commend the officers and soldiers who recovered Yan'an. The original text is as follows: Director Hu Zongnan to all officers and soldiers and compatriots in northern Shaanxi, By this message: The General Assembly listened to the news of Yan'an's recovery, and in addition to our joy, we extend our condolences. The Chinese Communists have been holding troops and dividing the country, undermining unification. The government has always hoped that they would come to their senses with a broad mind, but they have become even more intensified, with a full-scale rebellion, forcing the National Army, killing and looting the people, and the disaster is becoming more and more serious. In order to save the country and the people, the government cannot bear to see the country built by our countless martyrs and military and civilians who died in the War of Resistance being destroyed by bandits. We have no choice but to rise up and suppress the rebellion. Relying on the lives of all our officers and soldiers, and the cooperation of the people, we quickly recovered Yan'an, which had been occupied by the Chinese Communists for thirteen years. People have returned to their homes and have seen the light again. Thinking of the struggles and sacrifices of the officers and soldiers, and pitying the people who have been suffering from chaos for a long time, we send this telegram of condolence. Please accept our respects. Deliberated and approved by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Seal.

### Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Rejoice; American Newspaper Says Communist Party Suffers Serious Blow; Labor Support Movement Launched in Hankou, Shanghai, and Other Places

[Central News Agency, Manila, 20th] Overseas Chinese in the Philippines today were very excited about the news of the National Army's recovery of Yan'an, which had been occupied by the Communist Party for a decade. Local overseas Chinese leaders said they hope the government will continue to annihilate these rebels who deeply believe in force and are the only major obstacle to China's revival work in the last 20 years.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] According to qualified political observers: The National Army's occupation of Yan'an may dislocate the Communist Party's military and political systems, shorten the duration of the civil war, and promote the early participation of the third party in the government. The National Army's continuous victories are extremely important in political, military, economic, and psychological aspects. At the same time, the National Army's chances of opening up the Jinpu, Pinghan, and Tongpu Railways are also increasing day by day. Once these three lines are opened, North China and the Central Plains can be connected, accelerating economic recovery.

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] A New York Times editorial believes that the recovery of Yan'an, even if it does not mean the end of the civil strife, is a serious blow to the Communist Party.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 20th] After the liberation of Yan'an, 500,000 citizens of Xi'an celebrated with great enthusiasm today.

### Yan'an in Brief

— This Newspaper Archives

Yan'an, the old nest occupied by the Chinese Communists for twelve years, was recovered by the National Army at 10:00 AM on the 19th. In the summer of the 24th year of the Republic, the Chinese Communist army, unable to stand in Ruijin, Jiangxi, made the "25,000-Li Long March" to Yan'an, occupied it, established its own "Border Region Government," issued its own "Border Region Currency," and trained its own army, making this small place with its barren land and poor people become the focus of attention throughout the country and even the world.

Yan'an, in the past, when the Chinese emperors built their capitals in the area around Xi'an, was originally a thoroughfare for transportation and tribute. Later, the capital moved to Beiping, and Yan'an gradually became desolate and declining. Before the Chinese Communists entered Yan'an, the population there was less than 3,000 people. Northern Shaanxi is a complex of mountainous land, and the Yan River flows from the northwest to the south, into the Yellow River, passing through Yan'an. On both sides of the Yan River are mountain ranges, and the earthen city of Yan'an is built at the foot of the mountains on both sides. The Yan River is quite narrow, but the water is extremely shallow.

Decent houses, except for the Chinese Communist organs and residences of key personnel, are rarely seen in Yan'an. The general population lives in cave dwellings at the foot of the mountains. On the high and low peaks, there are countless cave dwellings. Although the cave dwellings vary in size, the style is almost the same. The outside is oval, the bottom is flat, and the inside is, of course, quite damp. Light and air are out of the question. Under such living conditions, disease is very common. The most common diseases in Yan'an, according to an American missionary who lived in Yan'an for many years and worked in medical care, are skin diseases and venereal diseases. Skin diseases are due to uncleanliness in living and lifestyle habits, while venereal diseases are due to the Chinese Communist Party's absolute laissez-faire attitude towards sexual relations between men and women.

The location of the Chinese Communist Central Committee organs is on a small hillside outside Yan'an, called Yangjialing, which has very beautiful scenery. The buildings are backed by the hillside, and many of the Chinese Communist key personnel live there. Many of the houses in that area are very decent, which is, of course, very different from the cave dwellings inhabited by the general population.

As mentioned above, the population of Yan'an was less than 3,000 before the Chinese Communists occupied it. Later, it gradually increased, and by the time of the victory in the War of Resistance, the population had reached 50,000, of which more than three-fifths were Chinese Communist civil servants, and many were family members of these civil servants. The level of education in northern Shaanxi is quite low, and Yan'an is no exception. After the Chinese Communists occupied it, they tried their best to promote their political views, so there are propaganda posters and other things everywhere on the streets. The women of Yan'an still retain the old costumes of decades ago, with narrow and long sleeves, small and narrow trousers legs, no skirts, and a round hairstyle on their heads.

The land in the Yan'an area is barren, and there are not many agricultural products, only millet, corn, cotton, and a few other kinds. However, the Chinese Communists spare no effort in economic extraction. They established a "Border Region Bank" to control the finances of the entire "Border Region" and issued "Border Region Currency" to replace the legal tender. At the same time, they also universally operated so-called "cooperatives" in all cities and villages under their occupation, and all of the peasants' production and consumption were seized by the cooperatives. It was by relying on these methods that the Chinese Communists extracted a large amount of money for use in the civil war.

### National Army Conducting Sweeping Operations on Both Sides of the Lin Yanzhou Section of the Jinpu Railway; War Around Jinan Becomes Less Intense

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 20th] The National Army's large-scale sweeping operations on both sides of the Lin Yanzhou section of the Jinpu Railway in recent days are a sign that they will soon launch a counterattack against the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains.

[This Newspaper, Yanzhou, 20th] The war in the Tai'an and Dawenkou areas has recently become quiet, with only minor contacts in recent days. In addition, the National Army in the northeast area of Sishui consolidated its new position on the 20th, and there were no major changes in the war situation.

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 20th] The National Army in southwestern Shandong recovered Weishan Island in Weishan Lake on the 18th. On the morning of the 19th, the National Army swept from Nanyang Town, Dushan, and Gucun in separate directions. At noon, it recovered the so-called Daoshan County, which had been occupied by the Communist army for many years. More than 200 Communist troops surrendered with their weapons. The Communist army in the triangular area between Yutai, Jining, and Teng County has now been cleared.

[This Newspaper, Yanzhou, 20th] Yesterday, the National Army in Teng County swept the remnants of the Communist army's New 10th Division in an area more than 30 li east of the Jinpu Railway and recovered Sangcun, Xiazhuang, and Huashigou. In addition, the New 8th Division of the Communist army, which had been harassing the Baishi Pu and Huibushan areas east of the city for several days, was defeated and suffered heavy casualties.

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 20th] Fierce fighting is still going on around Jinan. The total number of troops used by the Communist army on the east, south, and north sides is no more than 20,000 to 30,000. The National Army firmly defends its strongholds and inflicts heavy blows on the Communist army, and it has a great advantage. There was fierce fighting in the areas of Longdong and Dongxi Wuzhuang southeast of Jinan City, in the areas of Yawangkou and Yaoqiangzhuang northeast of the city, and near Yancheng north of the city on the night of the 19th. The war slowed down by the morning of the 20th, but it is still at a standstill in the same place.

### Ministry of Food Plans Methods for Taxing Grain in Kind and Purchasing Grain

Under Review by the Economic Committee of the General Assembly

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Regarding the issue of taxing grain in kind and purchasing grain, the Ministry of Food has recently drafted a method and submitted it to the President. It has been submitted to the Third Plenary Session for discussion and is currently under review by the Economic Committee. The main points are (1) The requisition of grain will be suspended in the 36th year of the Republic. The principal and interest due for the requisition of grain in previous years (previously returned in grain) will be converted into legal tender and returned with reference to local grain prices. (2) The collection of grain in kind will be temporarily suspended in the 36th year, but in areas with poor grain production and inconvenient transportation, it may be converted into legal tender. (3) The real objects obtained from the field tax will be converted according to the grain price in the neighboring areas, and the central government will allocate funds for the purchase. However, the 30% local surtax will still belong to the local government. (4) The grain levy agencies in the areas where legal tender is collected will also be abolished. (5) The Changpingcang system must be established. (6) The China Farmers Bank must continue to actively promote warehousing and sales business.

### Law on the Election of the President and Vice President Passed

### Du Yuming Will Go to Changchun Immediately to Preside Over Military Conference; National Army Will Adopt New Strategy After the Songhua River Thaws

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 20th] Du Yuming said: The Communist army's fourth southward invasion was mostly made up of elite troops, and the casualties reached 30,000. There will be a new military strategy after the Songhua River thaws. He also said that the National Army's left wing is now on the Nong'an-Beichang-Taolu-Halahai road. Currently, only the Tonghua area in the northeast is slightly tight because the Communist army has about six or seven brigades trying to capture Tonghua.

[This Newspaper, Changchun, 20th] It is reported that Director Du Yuming will return to Changchun on the 21st. The military conference held here is also scheduled to open on the same day. In addition to discussing the security of the pacification zone and the military issues on both sides of the Songhua River, it will also review the gains and losses of the four battles south of the Songhua River.

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 20th] After Du Yuming returned to Shenyang, he had a long talk with Xiong Shihui that night. On the 20th, he summoned Zheng Dongguo and Zhao Jiaji to his official residence to discuss the Northeast military situation and will go to Changchun again within a few days.

### Talk by a Republican Congressman: The United States Will Strengthen Aid to China; Appeasement of the CCP Was a Mistake

[United Press International, Washington, 19th] Republican Senator Brewster declared on the 19th that he was certain that US policy toward China "within three weeks" would change to provide stronger support to the National Government. He declined to disclose the source of his information, stating only that the date came from people who deeply felt that the policy toward China must change. He also stated, "We are courting the Communist Party in China while overthrowing the Communist Party in Greece. This contradictory situation is incomprehensible. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is requesting the National Government to provide relief supplies to the Communist Party, while President Truman is demanding the elimination of Communist forces in Greece. What is the difference between the Communist Parties in China and Greece? I would like to hear the details." Brewster hoped that MacArthur's authority would be extended to China to be responsible for managing the Far East in the capacity of a deputy regent. MacArthur has always been able to understand the people of the East. In 1943 and 1946, Brewster, in his capacity as a member of the War Investigation Committee, inspected the Far East and discussed this with MacArthur, but MacArthur did not express his opinion. When asked if Brewster intended to change Marshall's mediation plan, he replied, "No, I would like MacArthur to preside over it and learn his opinion." Regarding the claim that supplies for the National Government's war against Japan were used for the internal war against the Communists, Brewster believed that it was Communist propaganda. He also stated that if we want to promote a good neighbor policy, the initial action should be in the Far East. A strong China is the best guarantee of peace in the Pacific, or even the entire world. The previously proposed loan of 500 million US dollars to China has been suspended in recent months, but when providing assistance to Greece, these issues will be raised again.

[United Press International, New York, 19th] The Howard newspaper chain recently published an editorial on the China issue, stating that congressional commentators should realize that the US's appeasement of the CCP is a mistake. The contradictory situation in China is due to President Truman's efforts to arrange the world order before adjusting the State Department's policies. Now, the President should apply the principles of his Turkey and Greece policy to other regions to reconcile this situation. "New York Times" writer Tolischus stated that if China is controlled by the Soviet Union, the United States will encounter the same situation as preventing Japan from conquering China. If Japan is placed under a Communist regime, the result will be the same. Therefore, the United States has no other way to go except to aid Chairman Chiang.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, today's telegram] According to reliable sources: The US loan of 500 million US dollars to China will be realized after the reorganization of our Executive Yuan. This matter will greatly benefit our future economic construction.

### Vice Minister Liu Misses Hong Kong Speech; China-UK Commercial Treaty Being Negotiated; Draft Agreement Expected to Be Signed in Mid-July

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 19th] According to the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Evening News: The newspaper's reporter recently visited Liu Wei, our Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was passing through Hong Kong to attend the Trusteeship Council meeting. According to him: The China-UK commercial treaty is still under negotiation, and a draft agreement is expected to be signed in July this year, except for four points that are still under discussion, it has been prepared long ago. The four points are: (1) the China-UK exchange rate issue, (2) shipping issues, (3) barter agreements and lists of goods allowed for import and export, and (4) UK credit loans to China. According to the newspaper, regarding the first point, China and the UK plan to establish a joint organization, the nature of which is similar to the pre-war Exchange Equalization Account, to stabilize the Chinese currency. In addition to these four points, the UK also intends to specifically mention the status of Hong Kong in the China-UK commercial treaty in the commercial treaty. This is probably because the UK is eager to use Hong Kong as a solid base for China's trade.

### Chairman's Lineage Traced to Linhai, Genealogy Proves to Match

[Nanjing News] Information about the ancestors of Chairman Chiang has often been fragmented and incomplete. Recently, according to news from Linhai, Chairman Chiang's lineage originates from Linhai. The genealogy records the first ancestor, Xinggong, who was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Linhai in Zhang'an during the Tai Kang reign of the Jin Dynasty, the year Wu was destroyed. In the third year of Tai Kang, he moved his family to the county and built a hut under the Five Clouds of Mount Tai Gu. Recently, in order to explore his ancestral lineage, Chairman Chiang frequently instructed Wu Wenguanzhang Dingchang to send Zheng Shengsheng to Linhai for investigation and ordered the county government to assist. After receiving the order, Zheng went to Linhai in late last month and obtained the Chiang family genealogy, which matched the known details. He then sent three volumes of the genealogy to Nanjing to report back.

### Excessive Profits Tax Law Revised by the Judicial Yuan

### Judicial Yuan Discusses Draft Organization Law

Recognizes that the Ministry of Justice Should Belong to the Judicial Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Judicial Yuan recently held a meeting to discuss the draft organization law of the Yuan. During the meeting, different opinions were expressed on the points proposed in Wang Chonghui's draft. The most important point was the attribution of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The participants agreed that according to Article 82 of the Constitution, ("The organization of the Judicial Yuan and courts at all levels shall be determined by law."), since the courts at all levels belong to the Judicial Yuan, the Ministry of Justice should naturally belong to the Judicial Yuan. Another point of contention was the issue of Grand Justices. According to the draft proposed by Wang, the Grand Justices only have the power to interpret the Constitution. When the Judicial Yuan held a meeting, based on Article 78 of the Constitution, it gave the Grand Justices the power to "unify the interpretation of laws and orders." As for whether the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan should be ex officio Grand Justices, the views in the meeting also differed from those proposed by Wang, believing that the two should concurrently serve as Grand Justices. In addition, it was also suggested that a judge review committee should be established in the Judicial Yuan to review the qualifications of judges.

### Representatives From Various Circles in Guangdong Arrive in Nanjing to Request Guangzhou to be Changed to a Municipality Under the Executive Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Huang Yuming, Chen Muzhen, and other ten members of the delegation of representatives from various circles in Guangdong to promote Guangzhou as a municipality under the Executive Yuan have arrived in the capital and petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan separately, stating the reasons for the change. Their opinions are as follows: (1) Guangdong is the first place where the National Father started the revolution and has special circumstances in politics; (2) Guangzhou, like Shanghai and Tianjin, is one of the three major trading ports in our country and is also the hub of import and export trade for Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Guangxi, close to Southeast Asia, and related to international economy, which has special circumstances in economy; (3) It has the closest transportation with overseas and accepts Western culture the earliest, which has special circumstances in culture. Secondly, the population of the city reaches more than one million. At the same time, it was clearly stipulated as a special city in the 13th, 15th, and 19th years of the Republic of China. Therefore, it is specially requested to change it to a municipality under the Executive Yuan. There was already this proposal in the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which is under review.

### Representatives of Shanghai Coal Merchants Petition the Authorities

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Xie, Pan Yisan, De Zhexing, Mao Chunpu, Lu Qisheng, Chen Jinrong, and Wang Zuxun, the legal advisor of the Shanghai Coal Business Association, a total of seven people, went to Nanjing from Shanghai to carry out the petition. On the 19th and 20th, they went to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Weng Wenhao, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Fan Jichang, Secretary, and Wang Yunwu, Minister of Economic Affairs, received them. Xie and others respectively raised the difficulties and hopes of the members of the association. Weng and Wang expressed that they were very good. Xie and others will return to Shanghai on the 22nd. The intention of their petition is that Shanghai had more than 500,000 tons of coal in stock during the five years before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and at least 300,000 tons, but the amount of coal in stock after the victory is far less than before. If the energy of businessmen is used, on the one hand, the allocation is restricted, and on the other hand, it is opened up, the problem can be solved.

### Domestic Air Passenger Fares: Fixed at 500 Yuan Per Kilometer; Calculated Based on Actual Flight Mileage

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] After the domestic passenger flights of the China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation resumed on the 16th of this month, the fares of each route were also approved and adjusted by the Executive Yuan at the same time, but they have not yet been officially announced. Although a few newspapers in Shanghai have slightly published them, they are not very detailed. It is now learned that the price adjustment is purely calculated based on the distance of the actual flight mileage. Even if the starting and ending points are the same, it depends on the number of stops along the route. The fares of the main routes are listed as follows: From Shanghai via Nanjing, Xuzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Tianjin to Beiping, 770,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Nanjing, Qingdao, Jinan to Beiping, 700,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Qingdao to Beiping, 540,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Nanjing, Jiujiang, Hankou to Chongqing, 800,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Nanjing, Hankou to Chongqing, 740,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Hankou, Chongqing to Kunming, 1,050,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Hankou to Kunming, 1,000,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Zhengzhou to Lanzhou, 900,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Nanjing, Xi'an to Yizhou, 850,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Nanjing, Hankou to Xi'an, 700,000 yuan; from Shanghai via Nanjing to Xi'an, 600,000 yuan; from Chongqing via Hankou, Zhengzhou to Beiping, 930,000 yuan; from Chongqing via Hankou to Beiping, 900,000 yuan; from Chongqing via Xi'an, Tianjin to Beiping, 800,000 yuan. The fares of the above routes are generally calculated at 500 yuan per kilometer per passenger (before the adjustment, it was 170 yuan per kilometer per passenger). The freight rate for overweight baggage and general cargo is 540 yuan per kilogram per kilometer. If there are two or more routes flying between the departure station and the destination station, the freight is calculated according to the kilometer of the shortest route.

### Regarding the Confluence of the Yellow River, Xue Dubi Replied to Egerton Denying Violation of Joint Consultation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Xue Dubi, Chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, made a statement in Nanjing on the 19th regarding the Yellow River blockage project (recorded in yesterday's newspaper), and also issued a "Reply to General Egerton, Director of the UNRRA China Office," the original text of which is as follows:

General Egerton, greetings, I have received your letter of March 14, protesting that I did not convene another meeting before the Yellow River breach was closed, believing that it violated the joint consultation. When discussing the Yellow River breach closure issue in Shanghai on February 8, Mr. Dong Biwu, the representative of the CCP, requested that he be notified before the breach mouth was closed and that consultations be held again before the closure. I solemnly stated on the spot that the Yellow River breach closure project was a battle with floods, and we must race against time. As soon as the opportunity arose, we had to rush to close the breach day and night. The closure could not be stopped. If we stopped work for consultation again, all previous efforts would be wasted. I firmly stated that we could not consult again and told Mr. Dong that if we consulted again when the closure was approaching, and your side objected, whether we could stop the closure was absolutely impossible. Mr. Dong immediately stated that he only hoped to be notified in advance, and I replied that he would definitely be notified in advance before the closure through UNRRA, as evidenced by my conversation with the reporter of the Central Daily News on February 11. What I admitted was only advance notification. I had firmly denied the consultation again on the spot. Later, the UNRRA sent the record of the conversation for review, but did not include my opposition to the consultation again, and I refused to sign it. Previously, on March 8, I received a telegram from Director Huo of UNRRA on March 7, stating that the CCP and UNRRA frequently inquired about the breach situation, and I immediately replied to Director Huo, saying that the breach closure work was prepared to start on March 9, and hoped to be completed within ten days if there were no unexpected obstacles, and please convey the message. Now, as before, I am re-inquiring with Director Huo when he conveyed the message and enclose Director Huo's incoming telegram, my reply telegram, and the Central Daily News of February 11, all for your reference. In short, for the various items discussed with the CCP in Shanghai last time, for all the promises made at that time, such as allocating 4 billion yuan to UNRRA within three days as funds for downstream dike construction, it was immediately allocated as scheduled. As for convening a consultation before the closure, since I did not promise it at that time, I have no obligation to fulfill it. I cannot admit that you said I violated the joint consultation. I hereby reply and hope you understand, with best regards, Xue Dubi, March 19.

### The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee Commended All Employees of the Yellow River Closure

The loss of the original spirit is inestimable. For several months, relying on all of our employees, enduring wind and rain, braving frost and dew, working tirelessly day and night, the closure project was successfully completed. From then on, thousands of miles of turbulent waters will once again enjoy the joy of peaceful waves, which will greatly benefit the national economy and people's livelihood. Recalling the hard work, I hereby send a telegram to express my condolences. Yin Haoyue, seal of the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.

### Chairman Approved Tang Enbo's Proposal: Establish a Management Bureau in the Taihu Area; Specific Measures are Under Discussion by Relevant Agencies

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 20th] Taihu Lake spans the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, with a special terrain, which is inconvenient to govern, and has become a den of bandits for more than a hundred years. Since the suppression of the Jiangnan sub-district last autumn, the bandit atmosphere in the Taihu area has subsided for a while, but it is not a long-term plan. General Tang Enbo, in view of this, proposed to delineate the Taihu islands and the land within five kilometers along the coast as an independent special administrative region, imitating the Lushan method, and set up the Taihu Management Bureau to be responsible for the formulation of security policies, the development of transportation, and the operation of industries. The jurisdiction system is directly under the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The above plan was presented to Chairman Chiang by Tang and was approved in principle. However, the jurisdiction and powers of the subordinate areas have been handed over to the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Interior to jointly discuss with the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Finance, and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to report and decide. Due to the multitude of institutions involved and the importance of the relationship, the relevant parties are carefully studying it.

### The Central Government Formulates a Plan to Restore Cotton Production

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] The central government has formulated a large-scale plan to restore cotton production in order to supply textile factories with high-quality cotton and reduce foreign exchange expenditures. It is reported that in the 35th year of the Republic of China, coastal textile factories almost entirely relied on American cotton, so the import of American cotton last year accounted for half of the government's total foreign exchange expenditure. This American cotton was mostly old and damaged, making it unsuitable for textiles. Therefore, at the request of public and private textile industries, the central government specially established the Cotton Production Improvement Office, and a branch office was established in Beiping. Under the leadership of Feng Zefang, the Beiping branch office has formulated a three-year plan for the four provinces in North China (Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi) to restore cotton production in North China to the level of the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China. Under the Beiping branch office, four guidance zones will be set up first in Beiping, Tianjin, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang, and several offices will be set up to dispatch technical personnel to guide cotton farmers.

### Four Hundred Tons of UNRRA Cotton Seeds Shipped to Tianjin for Distribution in North China

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper in Beiping, 20th] To assist in the restoration of Chinese cotton fields destroyed by the war, UNRRA has allocated 400 tons of American cotton seeds.

The UNRRA Executive Headquarters has decided to allocate ten tons for shipment to the Northeast, while the remaining 390 tons will be distributed equally between the areas controlled by the Nationalists and the areas controlled by the Communists, as requested by the CCP.

### Counterfeit Intelligence Agency Busted in Suzhou City

They were intercepted again in Shanbeixiang, Guangde, and have now fled into the mountainous areas on the Liyang-Guangde border.

Editorial

### The Issue of Japanese Reparations Should Be Resolved Soon

On the 17th, General MacArthur made an important statement to the press, expressing three points of view on how to deal with defeated Japan: (1) A peace treaty with Japan should be concluded as soon as possible; (2) The issue of Japanese reparations should be resolved early; (3) Japan's trade with all countries in the world should be restored. This statement immediately aroused reactions from relevant countries. The spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that the government authorities are currently meticulously preparing to handle the issue of reparations in the peace treaty with Japan. Therefore, as the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers are heatedly discussing the issue of German reparations in Moscow, how should the issue of Japanese reparations be resolved? It has once again become the focus of world attention.

Japan's invasion of China was the trigger for World War II; Japan's sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, Hong Kong, and Singapore was a major turning point that united the Far Eastern war with the European war. Therefore, Japan is the chief culprit of World War II and should bear the same responsibility as Nazi Germany. It should be responsible for compensating the vast losses suffered by the United Nations as a result of the war against Japan. The Allied countries had already made a decision in principle on this issue, roughly based on the resolution passed at the Potsdam Conference in 1944 on the issue of German reparations. In other words, Japan should, to the best of its ability, compensate for the various losses inflicted on the United Nations during the war. This broad principle also contains two meanings: on the one hand, to dismantle all of Japan's military equipment, including industrial and economic institutions directly or indirectly related to military affairs, so that Japan will not endanger world peace and security again; but on the other hand, under the principle of non-retaliatory magnanimity, to take into account the future lives of the Japanese people and maintain a reasonable standard of living, and gradually lay a peaceful economic foundation.

Although this broad principle is agreed upon by the countries concerned, the interpretation, limitations, and execution of this established principle are not only inconsistent among the countries, but also sometimes differ among the people of the same country. For example, between the United States and the Soviet Union, first, the two countries disagreed on the definition of "war booty." On the Soviet side, it was believed that the Japanese industrial equipment that it had moved away was Soviet "war booty" and could no longer be used for reparations; the United States, however, believed that this was Japanese property and should be used for reparations, and that the value of the industrial equipment moved away by the Soviet Union should be deducted from the reparations that the Soviet Union was entitled to. This dispute is still an unresolved issue between the United States and the Soviet Union. Second, regarding the level of industry that Japan should retain, the United States believes that a fairly high level should be maintained to avoid the United States having to bear any further burdens for Japan; the Soviet Union, however, believes that the United States' level is too high and risks allowing Japan's aggressive forces to easily make a comeback. This issue is indeed not easy to resolve. President Truman's reparations commissioner, Edwin Pauley, personally went to Japan to conduct an on-site inspection and submitted a report to the President after returning to the United States, advocating that Japan's industrial level should be based on 1928, but after research by the State Department, it was unanimously believed that the Pauley plan would reduce the living standards of the Japanese people, so it was revised to broaden the scale and advocate that Japan's industry be restored to the level of 1932. As a result, Pauley had no choice but to submit his resignation.

From this, it can be seen that the reparations issue is not easy to resolve. Therefore, the Far Eastern Commission repeatedly convened meetings, but ultimately failed to reach a concrete implementation plan. It was not until the end of last month that the Far Eastern Commission decided to authorize MacArthur to propose a compromise solution to distribute 20% of the total value of the already designated Japanese industrial equipment to China, the Philippines, and other countries in urgent need as initial reparations. At that time, the Soviet Union also expressed agreement in principle with this temporary reparations plan, but it still attached conditions, namely, that the Soviet Union requested that when distributing its share, the value of the industrial equipment moved away by the Soviet Union from Northeast China should not be deducted. After careful consideration, MacArthur's compromise solution may still not be realized for the time being.

Taking China as an example, although no formal request for Japanese reparations has been made, it has already been decided in principle that "our country has resisted aggression the longest and suffered the greatest losses, and our country should enjoy a superior percentage and priority in receiving reparations from Japan to the Allied countries." This enlightened and magnanimous attitude will surely be appreciated by other Allied countries, because from the July 7th Incident until the end of the War of Resistance, the total losses of public and private materials suffered by our country totaled no less than $300 billion, not including the casualties of soldiers and civilians and the expenditure of national military expenses. Now, after suffering great pain, our country is engaged in post-war reconstruction work, and both materially and financially, it needs external assistance. Japan has surrendered for nearly two years, so how can the reparations issue be allowed to remain unresolved for so long? Although the peace treaty with Germany has not yet been drafted and the issue of German reparations is still the focus of the US-Soviet dispute at the Moscow Conference, our country, because of its actual needs, really cannot allow it to be delayed any longer. The Far Eastern Commission's authorization to MacArthur to propose a compromise solution may also be for this reason. But from a distance and from a larger perspective, MacArthur's approach is not a permanent solution, so MacArthur himself also hopes that the reparations issue can be resolved as soon as possible.

MacArthur's sincere words have aroused the resonance of various countries. China, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia all agree that the time for discussing the peace treaty with Japan has matured, especially the issue of reparations, which urgently needs to be resolved; however, the Far Eastern Commission still faces countless difficulties in discussing this issue. First, the issue of reparations is inseparable from the issue of Japan's industrial level, and even from Japan's entire economic issue. It can be seen that the complexity of reparations is by no means a simple issue. We have seen the difficulty in resolving the German reparations issue, so it is not difficult to know that resolving the Japanese reparations issue is not easy. Second, the Soviet Union is unwilling to compromise on its demand for $100 billion in reparations from Germany, and it is expected that the Soviet Union will not relax its demands for reparations from Japan at all. At the same time, the Soviet Union must insist on its view of "war booty," which is really difficult to obtain a compromise that can satisfy all relevant countries. Third, the United Kingdom's views are in principle the same as those of the United States, but the United Kingdom insists that all autonomous territories must participate in the discussion of resolving the reparations issue; in France, although it also trusts MacArthur's control of Japan, it also advocates that the issue of Japan should be decided by the foreign ministers of the four countries. All of this is enough to prove the differences in the opinions of the major powers. We boldly point out that if the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference's discussion of the issue of the peace treaty with Germany cannot reach an agreement due to the differences in opinion of the four countries, then the peace treaty with Japan and the issue of reparations will be even more difficult to resolve.

In short, we not only believe that the time for concluding a peace treaty with Japan has long matured and that the reparations issue should be resolved quickly, but also hope that MacArthur will take immediate action to implement his proposed temporary reparations plan as soon as possible.

### Foreign Ministers' Meeting Discusses German Economy; Four Powers Remain Divided; Secretary Marshall Hopes US and USSR Can Reach Understanding; French Foreign Minister Reiterates Determination to Oppose German Economic Unification

[News from This Newspaper] Moscow, 20th (Broadcast): French Foreign Minister Bidault reiterated his determination to oppose the economic unification of Germany at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting today. It is said that France can agree to the unification plan, but on one condition: France must obtain German coal. Molotov supported the French Foreign Minister's request, but Bevin refused.

[News from This Newspaper] Moscow, 20th (Broadcast): The Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers held their tenth meeting today. The US and Soviet Foreign Ministers engaged in a heated debate over the issue of German reparations. Molotov argued that German reparations should be extended for 20 years to prevent Germany from engaging in aggression again. Marshall opposed this, arguing that this method would overburden the German people and prevent them from engaging in reconstruction work, which would have a significant impact on the stability of Europe.

[News from This Newspaper] Moscow, 20th (Broadcast): Today's Foreign Ministers' Meeting was chaired by Marshall. Marshall suggested inviting Austria to Moscow to participate in the discussion of the Austrian peace treaty. Marshall suggested that this suggestion be discussed again at tomorrow's Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

[United Press, Moscow, 19th] US Secretary of State Marshall and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov both believe today that although the Allies cannot agree on the issue of reparations, they can hope to coordinate their views on the future of Germany. Molotov declared at the meeting today that the Soviet Union's position on the unification of the German economy is similar to the US plan, and he believes that relevant points can be negotiated and agreed upon. Marshall then declared that what Molotov said was very exciting, and that although their opinions on the reparations issue are different, their general views can be harmonized. He and Molotov both expressed the same feeling. However, Marshall still rejected the Soviet Union's request to increase Germany's industrial output for reparations, saying that if this increase plan were implemented in Germany, it would repeat the mistakes after World War I. Molotov's opinion was that the unification of Germany's economy and reparations must be considered at the same time.

Other key points of Molotov's arguments are as follows: (1) Molotov supported France's request to stipulate that a certain amount of German coal production be distributed to the Allied countries (Bevin opposed this). (2) Molotov advocated joint management of the Ruhr area, the center of German heavy industry, by the four powers. (3) Molotov insisted that the reparations agreement negotiated at Potsdam could not replace the agreement reached at Yalta.

Key points of Bevin's opinions are as follows: (1) The United Kingdom cannot become a member of the four-power joint management of the Ruhr area. (2) The United Kingdom often wants to increase Germany's steel production, but this is only for survival, not for reparations. (3) Before the German economy is unified, the United Kingdom is unwilling to cancel the merger of the British and American occupation zones and will only do so after obtaining a satisfactory solution. (4) Outside criticism of the British and American occupation zones as an industrial patent "comfort zone" was not heard at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

[United Press, London, 19th] Authoritative sources said today that the British government has directly or indirectly supported the United States on two major disputes involving the Soviet Union. According to an external spokesman, the issue of German reparations should be based on the Potsdam Agreement to replace other agreements, and the British view is

### Bevin Writes to Stalin, Urging Opening of Treaty Revision Negotiations; Focus of Foreign Ministers' Meeting Shifts Outside the Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 19th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin wrote to Stalin today, saying that the British government is prepared to start negotiations with the Soviet Union to revise the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. He asked the Soviet government what way it hopes to start these negotiations. Does His Excellency prefer to hold preliminary talks with him, or does he hope that he will contact Foreign Minister Molotov directly? According to responsible sources, the United Kingdom proposed that the validity period of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty should be extended from 20 years to 50 years and should be revised in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, because the United Nations Charter had not yet been drafted when the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union signed the alliance treaty.

### Difficult Situation in the United Kingdom

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, Day Omitted] As the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Meeting is about to end, external activities such as discussions on the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly active. The general public believes that this is the core of the German issue, so they attach great importance to British Foreign Secretary Bevin's letter to Stalin to start negotiations to revise the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty as soon as possible, and to US Secretary of State Marshall's expression of willingness to sign a 40-year treaty with the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union on Germany. However, the general public believes that Foreign Secretary Bevin's position is inherently difficult, and it has become more difficult because of President Truman's statement on foreign policy. President Truman's speech made it impossible for the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union to reconcile. Between the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet Union has long believed that the relationship between the two countries is close, as if an unwritten alliance has been established.

### Paul Approved to Participate in Peace Treaty Discussions

[News from This Newspaper] London, 20th (Broadcast): The representatives of the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers have reached an agreement to allow enemy countries that declared war on Germany in the later stages of the war, namely Albania, Bulgaria, and Romania, to participate in the discussion of the peace treaty with Germany.

### Molotov

Will Be Stalin's Successor

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 20th] This issue of "Saturday Evening Post" carries the remarks of Kravchenko, former member of the Soviet Purchasing Committee in the United States, strongly arguing that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has been appointed as the successor to Marshal Stalin. Marshal Stalin is now 67 years old, and for some time, his health has been a topic of concern for all parties.

### Key Members of US Republican Party Discuss US Foreign Policy

We must act in this way to prevent other democratic countries from doubting our long-distance policy." Landon also said: "Truman's message to Turkey and Greece is a challenge to "Soviet imperialism and aggressive policy".

[United Press, Washington, 20th] According to reports here today, Congress will expand its investigation into President Truman's plan to aid Turkey and Greece. Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Chu Te, said: "He wants to know whether the United States is adopting one policy in Greece and another policy in China.

### Trials of Japanese War Criminals to be Shortened

Chief Justice Sir William Webb made a surprising announcement today, stating that he hopes this change will be dramatically different from the past.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to Third Plenary Session, Urging Compassion for People's Livelihood, Reducing Tax Burden, Post-War Industry and Commerce in Difficult Circumstances on the Verge of Ruin, Balancing the Budget Should Not Rely on Tax Increases as a Stopgap

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Third Plenary Session, requesting compassion for the people's livelihood, reducing taxes, reducing tax rates, merging tax collection agencies, simplifying tax payment procedures, and never ignoring the post-war reality. They urged against using tax increases as a stopgap measure, which would cause the people to lose their desire to live. The original telegram stated: We have heard that Your Session is considering increasing various taxes in order to balance the national budget. State expenditure comes from the people's livelihood. In principle, this is a natural law. However, compared to before the war, whether the people's livelihood has increased or decreased, and whether they can bear ten times or a hundred times the burden compared to before the war, this is a major issue that all those who care about national planning and politics believe should not be ignored. According to our country's history, after major turmoil and great military reforms, those in power have always made it their first priority to reduce taxes and allow the people to rest. Therefore, after generations of hardship, they were able to achieve a prosperous and peaceful society, known as the rule of Wen and Jing and the reign of Zhenguan. If heavy taxes are levied at a time when the people are suffering and their vitality has not recovered, the masses will be distraught and lose their desire to live, inevitably leading to resentment and separation. Historical examples are numerous. Although today's era is slightly different, the comfort and suffering of the people's livelihood is the foundation of national security, and has been the same from ancient times to the present. Today's inability to balance revenue and expenditure is due to the huge expenses. The fundamental solution should be to reduce expenditure and eliminate corruption, not to focus solely on increasing taxes. During the eight-year War of Resistance, rural materials were completely plundered by the enemy and puppets, followed by a year and a half of turmoil. Today's rural areas can be described as desolate and dead. The domestic sales of industry and commerce are mainly targeted at the vast rural areas and cannot rely solely on a few wealthy people. Now, the looms are empty, the people lack storage, and purchasing power has dropped to the lowest level. Inventory is decreasing year by year, and customers are scarce. Those who struggle to survive only hope that the government can provide low-interest loans as a life-saving elixir. Therefore, today's rural areas are on the verge of extinction, and commerce is in a state of begging. However, in terms of taxes, they are perhaps more than ten times higher than before the war. In the past, during the era when transit taxes were not abolished, there were no other taxes besides paying taxes at the customs and drawing transit taxes at checkpoints. Later, there were taxes on goods, taxes on business, and taxes on income. However, when they were first implemented, the tax rates were still low. For example, for business tax, before the war, the tax rate was calculated in terms of a few thousandths, but now it has been changed to a few percent. Before the war, the stamp tax on invoices and bills was at most three yuan, but now it is calculated at three yuan per thousand yuan, and the proportion is increased without any limitation, which is equivalent to levying a transaction tax once. For example, the business license tax was previously limited to certain special businesses, but now it has been changed to require all businesses to pay it. As for profits, they are decreasing year by year in terms of goods, but the figures are increasing day by day. The so-called tax on income and profits is inevitably like draining a pond to catch all the fish. In short, the number of taxes and the weight of tax rates are heavier than during the era when transit taxes were not abolished, and in fact, they have become even more serious. What's more, after victory, in addition to taxes, there are various unnamed donations that come one after another. Every time something is done, a quota is often set and each industry is ordered to pay according to the quota, once a month at least, and up to two or three times. Often, the annual donation amount is equal to or exceeds the annual tax amount. The thatched huts and ramshackle houses cannot bear the burden. The whole family sighs in secret, but those in charge avoid facing the problem and are unwilling to report this to the authorities, leaving the general public with a sense of powerlessness. Every time I think about the national crisis, I can't help but feel chills. The Chamber believes that the plan to govern today should be to be compassionate to the people's livelihood, reduce taxes, reduce tax rates, merge tax agencies, simplify tax payment procedures, and never ignore the post-war reality. We dare to offer our humble opinions and words of advice to the authorities, hoping that they will consider them. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

This has caused panic among the residents. The municipal government has paid attention to the rental relationship that may cause disputes. Ouyang Zunquan, director of the General Affairs Department of the municipal government, told reporters yesterday: When the lease expires, the government will not force a renewal in order to avoid losing faith with the owners. However, if the landlords are allowed to force the original residents to leave, collect transfer fees and sublet, the housing problem of thousands of public education staff will cause serious panic. For this reason, the municipal government has been considering formulating a win-win solution, or extending the lease term and giving the owners preferential treatment, or allowing the owners and residents to renegotiate a new contract under reasonable conditions. The municipal government has already telegraphed the Executive Yuan to consider and resolve it. According to Director Ouyang: "This is a difficult problem. The central government is not familiar with the situation in this city, and it may be difficult to have a perfect solution. However, the municipal government will be responsible to the end to seek a solution. Now that the expiration date is approaching, we will send personnel to Beijing to directly discuss solutions with the Executive Yuan."

### Zhou Gengsheng Died of Illness, A Strange Note Was Found in the Pocket, Someone Demanded a Huge Amount of Gold, His Mother Cried Out That Blue Bruises Were Found on the Corpse

[Our Newspaper] On the morning of the day before yesterday, the suspect of treason, Zhou Gengsheng, died of illness in the detention center of the High Court. A strange note was found in the pocket of the corpse. The original text of the note said: "Kun'er: I know about the note you sent. Yun wants 35 gold bars for bail. I am too busy to get out, so I can only try to find a way and ask the prosecutor to help. Mother." The detention center sent this note to the High Court. Because the matter was very bizarre, fearing that someone was using the name of the court to cheat and swindle outside, the mother of the deceased, Zhou Zhang, was summoned to the court for questioning yesterday morning. Judge Qiu asked: "Did you write and send this note?" Zhou Zhang replied: "No, I didn't send this note." Asked: "Does Zhou Gengsheng have another name, Zhou Kun?" Answered: "He only has one name, Zhou Gengsheng." Asked: "Then why are all the previous notes written with the name Xian'er?" Zhou Zhang hesitated. Judge Qiu continued to ask who wrote the previous notes? Who usually sends the notes to the prison? He also explained: "This matter has nothing to do with you. I'm afraid you've been cheated. You have to tell the truth, and the court can help you investigate." Zhou Zhang insisted that no one had asked her for gold bars and said: "Blue bruises were found on Zhou Gengsheng's corpse, which is still lying in the Xieqiao Funeral Home and has not been collected. I ask the judge to redress the injustice." As she spoke, she knelt down in the court, tears streaming down her face. It is heard that Zhou Gengsheng was a foreman at the Riyangang Pier. In order to compete for the business of the standard pier, he was accused of being a traitor by Wo Fulin, Li Qiyou, Lu Yuqiao, Jin Gu, and others, and was detained for more than a year without a verdict.

### Military Justice Court Trying War Criminals, The First Person Acquitted, No Confirmation of the Enemy Collusion Part of Korean Zhang Xiqiu

[Our Newspaper] The war criminal suspect case of Korean Zhang Xiqiu was acquitted by the Military Court of the First Appeasement District yesterday. This is the first person to be acquitted since the Military Court began trying war criminals. Zhang Xiqiu was arrested by the Xiamen Naval Garrison Command and sent to Shanghai, accused of colluding with Squadron Commander Qisaki of the enemy naval police in Xiamen during the War of Resistance and providing information. He also co-founded the Xingya Company with others, and the defendant contributed 4 million yuan in false Central Reserve Coupons and served as a director. The company transported rice and sugar from Shima and other places in Zhangzhou to Xiamen to sell to the trading groups controlled by the enemy, and transported gold and opium from Xiamen to the mainland for sale, helping the enemy promote the drug policy. After the Military Court's trial of the case, it was found that there was no confirmation of the part where the defendant colluded with the enemy and provided information. As for the transportation and sale of opium, it cannot be regarded as helping the enemy promote the drug policy, and it does not constitute the crime of "criminal intent" in law. Moreover, the defendant was indeed sentenced to three years in prison by the enemy for anti-Japanese activities in Korea. Based on the above points, he was acquitted.

### Scandal at a Pleasure Venue: Former Executive Committee Member of the Zhonghe Party Defaults on Tea Bill at a Dance Hall

[Our Newspaper Report] Yang Xiaoquan, also known as Yang Xiaocun, from Changchuan, age 33, who was recently expelled from the Zhonghe Party and formerly served as a Central Executive Committee member and special commissioner of party affairs stationed in Shanghai, went to the Xianle Dance Palace on Nanjing West Road with six friends before Christmas last winter. At that time, the dance hall intended to sell gift certificates, but Yang refused, claiming to be a friend of Director Zhuo of the New City Branch Bureau and also unwilling to pay for tea. The dance hall, believing him to be a friend of the director, granted his request and only charged him 60,000 yuan for small expenses. Yang then issued a check from the Chunmao Qianzhuang (D.O.38786), dated the 25th. Unexpectedly, the check was returned. The dance hall then filed a complaint with the New City Branch Bureau. Director Zhuo, upon receiving the complaint, was greatly surprised, as he had never met Yang Xiaoquan and wondered how he could claim to be a friend. He immediately ordered his subordinates to search for Yang Xiaoquan. At about 10:00 AM yesterday morning, he was finally arrested in the Longxing Lane on Tianjin Road and taken to the bureau for questioning, where he admitted the facts without hesitation. He is scheduled to be sent to the District Procuratorate this morning for further investigation. According to Gu Qiliu, the officer in charge of the case, Yang Xiaoquan leads a dissolute life and has recently been issuing bad checks, having defrauded Lido Dance Hall and several others, including Jinghua, Kangle, and Atlantic, for a total of more than ten million yuan.

### School Building Dispute Between Two Schools: Verdict Scheduled for the 25th

[Our Newspaper Report] Wu Lieifeng, the principal of Lieifeng English Day and Night School, borrowed four classrooms and one office from Zhenxi Elementary School at No. 27, Lane 437, New Dagu Road, in December of the 34th year of the Republic, during the school's preparation period. A lease was signed for a term of six months, stating that the premises would be vacated upon expiration and the right to object was waived. However, after the expiration of the lease in June of the 35th year of the Republic, Wu had no place to move and disputes arose due to the issue of the school signboard. Mediation by the District Procuratorate, New City Police Branch Bureau, and other competent authorities failed to resolve the matter. Xu Le, the principal of Zhenxi Elementary School, filed a lawsuit with the District Court, seeking eviction. The court hearing was held yesterday, and both parties appeared with their lawyers. After the court hearing, the verdict was scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 25th of this month.

### Four Customs Officials Accused of Collaboration: Yuan Jin and Two Others on Trial, Meilehe's Secret Order Submitted

[Our Newspaper Report] The case of Yuan Jin, Harbour Master of the Jianghai Customs; Xu Liang, Radio Engineer; Zhou Gongliang, Deputy Engineer; and Huang Jingen, Radio Monitor, being accused of being traitors, was heard for the first time in the High Court yesterday. Except for Huang Jingen, whose whereabouts are unknown, the other three defendants appeared in court.

According to the indictment from the High Procuratorate: The defendants Yuan Jin, Xu Liang, Zhou Gongliang, and Huang Jingen all entered the Customs Service between the 21st and 23rd years of the Republic. When the Pacific War broke out in the 30th year of the Republic, the enemy and puppets seized the Customs. Although the defendants were ordered by the Central Government to withdraw, they remained in the puppet Customs Service. The defendant Yuan Jin served as Deputy Director of the Harbour Affairs Department, in charge of harbour affairs inspection, and radio communications were also under his jurisdiction. The defendants Xu Liang and Zhou Gongliang served as Radio Engineers and Deputy Engineers, respectively, specializing in the installation and repair of radio stations and the inspection and repair of signal lights and lighthouses in various overseas directions. The defendant Huang Jingen initially served as a telegraph operator and was later promoted to Radio Monitor. When the Japanese surrendered, the Customs was taken over by personnel sent by the Central Government. Except for Huang Jingen, who had already left the service, the defendants Yuan Jin, Xu Liang, and Zhou Gongliang remained in their current positions. They were arrested and sent to the High Court by the Military Intelligence Bureau.

The defendants Yuan Jin and others argued that they continued to work in Shanghai during the occupation under the secret orders of Chief Inspector of Customs Meilehe and did nothing detrimental to the country. The radio was used for communication between lighthouses and grain transport ships, and the signal lights indicated the positions and directions of ships navigating the ocean. This was a general customs business and had no connection with military affairs. Subsequently, their defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, presented Meilehe's secret order to the court. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation.

[Another Report] The case of Shen Bochen, a clerk at the Jianghai Customs, being accused of being a traitor, was also heard in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Shen is 47 years old, from Hangzhou, and has served in the Customs Service for more than twenty years. In the 27th year of the Republic, he was transferred from Jinan to Guangzhou, where he served as an inspector. In the 28th year of the Republic, Guangzhou fell, and he continued to serve in the puppet Customs. After the court hearing yesterday, the hearing was adjourned for further investigation.

### China General Chamber of Commerce Bank: 50th Anniversary Celebration Approaching

The China General Chamber of Commerce Bank was founded in the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty and has a history of fifty years, making it one of the earliest banks established in China. In the spring of the 26th year, government shares were added, and it was converted into a capital of 4 million national currency, becoming a joint public-private bank. During the War of Resistance, the bank followed the government's westward retreat to the wartime capital. Under the leadership of the current Chairman of the Board, Du Yuesheng, and Associate Manager Luo Qinghua, it implemented national financial policies and contributed greatly to the industry and commerce of the Great Rear Area during the war. It also established branches in major cities in the Northwest and Southwest, forming a remittance network. After the restoration and return to Shanghai two years ago, it gradually reopened branches in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places, resulting in rapid business development. April 26th of this year marks the 50th anniversary of the bank's founding, and grand celebrations are planned to be held at that time. It plans to attract commemorative fixed deposits, provide small-scale industrial and commercial loans, and allocate 100 million yuan to establish scholarships to reward outstanding students from impoverished families. At the same time, a 50th-anniversary commemorative album will be published, entitled "Fifty Years of China's Economy," with approximately 300,000 characters. In addition to publishing the bank's historical facts, it will also invite authorities from various fields to provide concrete descriptions of China's economy, finance, currency system, public debt, finance, banking, money shops, trusts, insurance, trade, industry, mining, and transportation over the past fifty years for the reference of the public and to leave a permanent commemoration.

### 300 Units Approved for Agencies Receiving Supplies: Nearly 40,000 Employees

The Shanghai Public Education Personnel Supply Review Committee, after several days of review, has completed the review of all staff and employees of the various bureaus and departments of the municipal government and its affiliated agencies, as well as teachers and staff of municipal primary and secondary schools, totaling approximately 300 units.

As for the central government's affiliated agencies stationed in Shanghai, there are approximately 100 units, which have not yet been fully reviewed. It is estimated that the number of people will be at most 10,000, so the total number of people for this supply distribution is not expected to exceed 60,000. In addition, the prices for the distribution of daily necessities to public education personnel in Shanghai, which were previously proposed by the competent authorities and reported to the Executive Yuan, have now been approved by the Yuan.

### Smallpox, Diphtheria, Meningitis Widely Spreading in Shanghai Area: Health Bureau Issues Symptoms, Hoping Citizens Will Pay Attention and Prevent in Time

[Our Newspaper Report] Recently, the weather in the city has been unstable, sometimes warm and sometimes cold, leading to a significant increase in various infectious diseases, especially smallpox and epidemic meningitis. According to a public announcement from the Health Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Department yesterday, in January of this year, 121 smallpox cases were discovered, 165 in February, and 188 from March 1st to 18th, for a total of 473 cases, with 96 deaths. There were 39 epidemic meningitis cases in January, 62 in February, and 65 from March 1st to 18th, for a total of 166 cases, with 43 deaths. In addition, a considerable number of diphtheria cases have also been discovered, all higher than last year. The spread of smallpox is more widespread in the Huishan, Penglai, Yimiao, Hongkou, Songshan, Xincheng, and North Station districts. According to reports, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and other places are also experiencing outbreaks, and the number of cases in this city is increasing month by month, posing a threat of widespread epidemic. Citizens are urged to pay attention.

Patients Should Be Sent to Hospitals Immediately

If patients are discovered, they should seek medical treatment immediately and report to the local health office or the Health Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Department, telephone 12410, extension 14, which will send personnel to investigate, disinfect, and send the patients to the following isolation hospitals: (1) Municipal First Infectious Disease Hospital, 222 Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, telephone 02-62571; (2) Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital, 907 Hengbang Road, Zhabei, telephone 02-60144; (3) Guangci Hospital, 190 Sinan Road, telephone 71985; (4) Private Shangying Infectious Disease Hospital, 2 Zhongzheng West Road, telephone 60589.

Pay Attention to Three Types of Symptoms

In addition, the Health Bureau specifically issued the symptoms of smallpox, diphtheria, and epidemic meningitis yesterday, hoping that citizens will recognize them and take timely prevention. Smallpox: The patient initially experiences chills, shivering, nausea, severe headache, neck pain, limb pain, and a body temperature often exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. The nasal conjunctiva, oral cavity, and trachea are inflamed, and vomiting is sometimes seen. After three or four days, red papules appear on the skin, first on the face, then on the upper limbs and trunk, and later on the lower limbs. After five or six days, the papules turn into blisters. After eight or nine days, the blisters turn into pustules. After twelve days, the pustules rupture or dry up, forming scabs, which fall off within two or three weeks. Death often occurs during the pustule stage. (2) Epidemic Meningitis: The disease begins with sudden chills and shivering, followed by high fever, headache, vomiting, and stiff neck. Children often experience aphasia and convulsions. When lying on their back, patients bend their thighs to 90 degrees and cannot straighten them. Their legs, even if accidentally touched on the head or limbs, are hypersensitive to strong light and loud sounds, causing them to cry out loudly. Patients often have purple spots, and severe cases develop hemorrhagic purpura. (3) Diphtheria: The disease initially presents with mild chills and fever, followed by an increase in temperature, sore throat, which worsens when swallowing food, and a grayish-white pseudomembrane on the tonsils and throat. Breathing becomes difficult, and toxins invade the whole body, leading to systemic poisoning symptoms.

Seven Prevention Methods

As for prevention methods: (1) Housing Hygiene - The air in the house should be circulated, and windows should be opened frequently to let in sunlight. (2) Avoid Crowds - Places where large numbers of people gather are extremely prone to disease transmission and should be avoided. (3) Personal Hygiene - Shower frequently, change clothes frequently, and change underwear twice a week. (4) Avoid Contact with Patients - The oral secretions of patients must be carefully disinfected. (5) Pay Special Attention to Clothing - Avoid sudden changes in temperature. (6) Drink Plenty of Boiled Water and Eat More Fruits and Vegetables. (7) Vaccination: Smallpox - Go to a nearby vaccination station or vaccination team to be vaccinated against smallpox. Diphtheria - Go to a nearby health office to receive a diphtheria toxoid injection.

### Discount Sale of Wool Yarn

The Municipal Supply Office has announced that the price of the American three-strand wool yarn distributed in the ninth distribution was originally set at 54,000 yuan per pound. Due to the slight drop in market prices recently, after negotiations with the consigning merchants, the cost has been sacrificed, and the price has been reduced to 40,000 yuan per pound to benefit public education personnel. Those who have already paid and taken delivery of the goods are requested to present their original receipts to the accounting section of the office to recover the overpayment (refund of 14,000 yuan per pound). The distribution period has been extended to the 25th of this month, at which time the goods must be taken, and a selection can be made.

### Reward for Reporting Foreign Tigers: US$100,000 Available

### Frequent Fires: Mostly Due to Human Negligence, Several Families Crowded into One Room, Illegal Buildings Everywhere

[Our Newspaper Report] Since January of this year, fires have been frequent in the city. Looking at the fires that have occurred in the first half of this month alone, there have been as many as 71. This is an increase compared to the 113 in February and the 110 in January. The losses of life and property to citizens in previous fires have been particularly heavy. Taking the recent fire in the Dapuyi Bridge industrial area as an example, the estimated loss has reached more than 10 billion yuan. Insurance companies are feeling overwhelmed by the huge compensation fees for previous fires and are urgently seeking to intensify the investigation of the causes of the fires and jointly devise prevention methods.

A spokesman for the police department issued the following written statement yesterday regarding the repeated occurrence of fires in the city: An investigation of the 71 fires that have occurred in the first half of March reveals that careless use of fuel accounted for 23 of them. Ordinary residences accounted for the largest number of fire locations. The reason for this is that the city's population is increasing daily, the housing shortage is serious, and most citizens have no choice but to crowd several families into one room. There is no kitchen equipment, and coal prices are high, so most people use fire cans as stoves. With many people and hands involved, it is easy to cause accidents. If the buildings themselves are legal and can be rescued in time, the damage is still slight. However, there are illegal buildings everywhere in the city, and shantytowns are everywhere. Private fire-fighting equipment is lacking, so a fire, once it starts, becomes a mutual disaster. The fires at Dapuyi Bridge, Baoshan Road, and Sichuan Road are all proof of human negligence. If people can be careful and cautious everywhere, there will be fewer fires. As for the expansion of fires, poor construction and negligent management are to blame. The arbitrary storage of dangerous goods and the obsolescence of fire-fighting equipment also have an impact.

[Our newspaper Nanjing, 20th dispatch] After the victory and restoration, the Ministry of Education initially instructed all provinces and cities in the recovered areas to complete the screening of the qualifications of middle school students during the period of occupation during the summer of last year. However, due to practical difficulties in various provinces and cities, such as Nanjing, two screenings had been conducted before the third screening was recently completed.

Provinces and cities in the recovered areas can still handle the screening of middle school students' qualifications according to the actual situation when it is necessary to hold them again.

### Tsinghua After Restoration (Part 1)

— Mei Yiqi

Since the July 7th Incident and the fall of Peiping and Tianjin, in September 1937, our school was ordered to combine with Peking University and Nankai University to form the Changsha Provisional University. It was initially planned to use our school's buildings on the southern side of Mount Yuelu in Changsha, originally built for special research institutes, as temporary residences. However, as the war expanded and Nanjing fell, the Provisional University was again ordered to move to Kunming and renamed the National Southwestern Associated University. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, our school was also in Kunming for eight years. The situation of our school during these eight years has been reported in the alumni newsletters every year, and I believe our alumni have all read them. On May 4, 1946, when the wartime mission of the National Southwestern Associated University was completed, a graduation ceremony was held, and the restoration of our school began. The students of the three schools returned north in batches from May to August, and the faculty and staff of the three schools also came to Beiping from June onwards via land or air transport through Xiang, Han, Shanghai, or Chongqing. However, some colleagues had to wait until the affairs of the United University were completely concluded and the materials of the three schools were moved before leaving Kunming completely at the end of September. I left Kunming on September 6 and arrived in Peiping on the 11th. At that time, the Custody Committee, which was sent by our school to Peiping to be responsible for receiving and repairing, had been working hard for several months, and various parts of the school buildings were gradually being repaired. Our school then started classes at the old site of Tsinghua Garden on October 10, 1946, and the first semester began on November 5. There were more than 900 students who came from Kunming, more than 370 who were assigned from the Peiping Provisional University Preparatory Class, and more than 900 freshmen, transfer students, and graduate students who were admitted in the summer, plus more than 200 students in the preparatory class, a total of more than 2,300 people, which is more than double the number before the war. The faculty and staff initially numbered more than 500, and in the following months, they were successively hired as needed. The restoration phase can be considered to have been completed initially. Alumni of our school and people who care about our school are always concerned about the situation of our school after the restoration. Therefore, I will not hesitate to repeat in detail "Tsinghua After Restoration."

The Tsinghua Garden school buildings were occupied by the enemy for eight or nine years. Initially, troops were stationed, and then it was converted into a military hospital for the wounded, causing severe damage. Last spring, part of the buildings were again occupied by the Supply Area Military Hospital for several months. When our school took over the entire building in mid-July, although the main buildings were still largely the same in appearance, the doors and windows were incomplete, and the interior decoration had to be replaced. The library and gymnasium were the most severely damaged. To this day, the new library stack has not been repaired. Even if it can be repaired, it is still one floor short because the steel frame has been dismantled and is incomplete, and it cannot be fully equipped in the near future. The number of books in the collection before the war was more than 250,000 volumes of Chinese and Japanese books, more than 80,000 volumes of Western books, and more than 30,000 volumes of bound periodicals. After the restoration, we recovered about 135,000 volumes of Chinese and Japanese books, 43,000 volumes of Western books, and 20,000 volumes of bound periodicals from various places in Peiping. In terms of the number of volumes, the loss is about half, but the recovered books are often incomplete and difficult to supplement, so the actual loss is more than half. Therefore, the replenishment of books is one of the most important issues after the restoration of the school. The front sports field of the gymnasium was used by the enemy as a food warehouse for seven or eight years, and the filth and rot extended to the floor. After the takeover, it had to be completely renovated. The fitness equipment was completely gone, and the boiler was lost, so the heating equipment has not been repaired yet. Recently, it can only supply hot water to the bathroom. The new sports field was used by the enemy as a large kitchen, and the floor was completely demolished. Currently, because the wood is very expensive, it has been temporarily replaced with a cement floor for temporary use. The swimming pool has not been badly damaged, but many lockers in the changing room have been lost. With the large number of students today, the addition of various internal equipment is a major need, and it can only be done in stages in terms of time and funding.

The auditorium was less damaged, but the cork floor was worn through in many places, the curtains on the stage were torn by soldiers, the doors and windows had to be repaired, and the roof leaks had to be repaired, but the repair work was relatively easy. The building of the first courtyard is still the office of the school's administrative departments on the upper floor, and the classrooms, offices, and temporary student dormitories are on the lower floor. The last row of the second courtyard was demolished by the enemy, and the undemolished part was completely converted into classrooms. Tongfang Department still exists and is used as a small gathering place and a classroom for large classes. The buildings of the third courtyard (old secondary department) are the oldest and have been destroyed for eight or nine years, making them even more dilapidated and difficult to repair. Therefore, the rear rows have been demolished by the school, and their bricks and wood are used for repairs elsewhere. The Science Museum, Biology Museum, Chemistry Museum, Civil Engineering Museum, Hydraulic Museum, Electrical Engineering Museum, and Aviation Museum are all the same in appearance, but all the internal equipment is gone. Every chair and table must be newly made. Fortunately, with the efforts of our colleagues, temporary additions have been made, and a batch of instruments returned from Kunming can be barely used for ordinary teaching experiments. However, in order to lay the foundation for independent teaching and to promote academic research, the equipment of each department needs to be greatly supplemented, which goes without saying.

### Powerful Teams from Beiping and Tianjin Crushed　Northern Youth Continues to Report Victories in Tianjin　Defeats Pinglian and China United Teams in Final Two Matches

[Special Dispatch from Tianjin] The Changchun Northern Youth basketball team has been continuously victorious in Tianjin. Except for a loss to the American soldiers, they consecutively defeated Zhongfang, Tianjin Electric, and Huasheng. In the last two matches, on the 15th, they defeated Pinglian from Beiping, and on the 16th, they defeated the powerful Tianjin Hua team, fulfilling their expedition aspirations. Northern Youth may have a farewell match with the American soldiers. The details of the last two matches are as follows:

Defeats Pinglian

The match against Pinglian was packed with spectators, creating an unusual atmosphere of jostling. In the preliminary match, Huaqiang played against the Industrial and Commercial Affiliated Middle School. Referees Guo Fengshan and Gao Zhizhong officiated. Huaqiang took a 25-20 lead in the first half. In the second half, the Industrial and Commercial school fought back fiercely, tying the score three times. The situation remained tense. After 42 points each, Huaqiang’s Yang Zhikuan made a shot, and Guo Jinming made a free throw, giving Huaqiang a 45-42 lead, controlling the game. Industrial and Commercial’s Cheng Shichun made a final basket, narrowly losing by one point.

At the start of the main match, Northern Youth unleashed their fierce attack, with Tian, He, and Liu scoring three consecutive shots, leading 6-0. Pinglian called a timeout. Wang Yuanqi replaced Zhao Zhenmian. Tian He attacked the basket again, and Wang Shengzhi scored a long shot, breaking the ice. Northern Youth advanced together, leading 14-4, and Pinglian called another timeout. At 16-10, Pinglian called another timeout. Tian He and Liu Jianhua frequently penetrated the enemy lines, and Tian Binggang retaliated. The scores increased alternately. Northern Youth’s Ma Chunhe made frequent long shots. Pinglian often made mistakes due to excessive passing and poor defense, missing opportunities. At 34-25, Pinglian requested a small break. The two teams entered a mixed battle again. Wang Shengzhi broke through the final defense line. At the end of the first half, Pinglian closed the gap to 35-30.

The second half did not use the three-second rule. Pinglian's use of fresh players did not bring about a change. At 43-30, Northern Youth was already in an advantageous position. Pinglian used another timeout. Northern Youth’s momentum continued to rise. At 54-38, Pinglian was forced to call six timeouts. By the time the score reached 60-45, the crowd felt that Pinglian had no hope. Unexpectedly, Northern Youth became greedy for success and abandoned their defense. Pinglian took advantage of the situation, and Tian Binggang and Wang Yuanqi made contributions one after another. Wang Qi was also able to score independently. When the score was 61-58, Pinglian had good prospects. The time remaining was four and a half minutes. The atmosphere was extremely tense. At 68-60, Tian Binggang scored decisively. Shengzhi failed to check, and Qinghe made the free throw in response. Shengzhi was unwilling to be outdone and scored a basket. Tian Binggang broke through the hoop again, making the score 66-69. Ma Qinghe fired from the boundary, crossing the 70-point mark. Liu Jianhua secretly crossed Yinping [a strategic maneuver], bringing Northern Youth back from danger. Pinglian's offensive had not ended. Wang Yuanqi scored the final basket, making the score 68. The final whistle blew, and Pinglian narrowly lost by five points, 73-68.

Defeats Hua Team Again

The number of spectators watching Northern Youth play Hua team broke the previous record after Northern Youth defeated Huasheng. The atmosphere was even more tense. Hua team lost to Northern Youth 44-59. In the second match, Pinglian initially took the lead but then declined, allowing Huasheng to snatch victory from defeat. The final score was 65-54. The entire competition ended perfectly at 5:00 PM.

Hua team challenged Northern Youth and exchanged banners to show friendship. Under the refereeing of Gao Zhizhong and Yao Enhan, the fierce battle began. Main player Chen Wensheng was absent, weakening the team. Hui Shusheng committed two fouls, and Sai Wenying made consecutive free throws, giving Hua team an initial lead of 2-0. Northern Youth’s forward forces fought fiercely, creating a sudden 11-2 lead. Hua team called a small break, and each team regrouped. Northern Youth led 16-8 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Hua team continued to underperform. After personnel changes, there was no improvement. Instead, flaws were repeatedly exposed. Northern Youth won this quarter 16-5, leading 32-13 overall.

At the start of the second half, Ma Chunhe and Meng Qingcheng contributed significantly. At 40-13, Hua team was forced to call a timeout. At 46-17, Hua team requested their fourth timeout.

During the discussion, it was noted that the stock market was weak again yesterday morning. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily cancel the measures stipulated in the Stock Exchange Announcements No. 156 (collecting a 10% special security deposit in cash from buyers) and No. 162 (collecting a 10% special security deposit in cash from sellers) starting from the afternoon market yesterday.

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market, after the Exchange announced the cancellation of special security deposits for both buyers and sellers from the afternoon, quickly turned firm after a period of weakness. Some major stock market players have already switched from short to long positions, with Xinyi rising the most strongly.

Morning Opening

Weak and flat. The difference between current and forward transactions is only 70 yuan. After the opening, numbers 223, 231, 97, 78, 224, 100, 14, 177, and 179 were all sold. Diyi Yongsha immediately declined. Numbers 106, 95, 236, 171, and 186 were absorbed, but numbers 231, 223, 224, 155, 87, and 57 were all offered for sale, pushing Diyi Yongsha down to 2550 yuan, and immediate delivery fell to 2490 yuan. Numbers 128 and 179 advanced to 2620 yuan. Numbers 156, 235, 177, 32, 22, 141, 149, and 87 were all sold. Current and forward transactions in Mei Ya, Underwear, Zhongfang, Zhongs, Zhongfa all declined to their limit. Yongsha fell to a low of 2460 yuan. Numbers 198, 152, 61, 185, 224, 235, 134, and 32 took advantage of the low prices to suddenly move in. At 11:15 AM, news spread that the Stock Exchange was holding an emergency meeting, giving people hope, and prices rebounded to 2570 yuan. Numbers 14, 65, and 76 were once again offered for sale, retreating to 2520 yuan. Numbers 223, 4, 56, 186, 152, 52, 143, 2, and 180 were successively bought in. The market recovered to 2600 yuan at midday, but there was a slight setback after the close. As a result, Yongsha declined slightly compared to the previous close. Xinyi, Mei Ya, Huafeng, Xingguang, Jingfu, Qinyin, and Zhongfa all fell by about 0.5%. Xinhua fell by slightly more than 10%. Forward transactions in Yongsha, Xinyi, Huafeng, and Xingguang declined by 0.5%. Mei Ya fell by 10%. There were not many transactions in Jingfu, so it only declined slightly. Among the less active stocks, Zhongs fell to its limit. Zhongfang, Xinya, and Underwear once fell to their limit before recovering slightly. The rest all fell by about 0.5%.

Because the Exchange announced that it would cancel special security deposits for both buyers and sellers starting from the afternoon of the 20th, the market became agitated. Forward transactions opened high at 2750 yuan. Numbers 152, 223, 231, 65, 32, 97, 13, 197, and 198 took profits and aggressively sold, causing the price to fall back to 2630 yuan. Numbers 129, 99, and 224 took advantage of the low prices to absorb and turn the market around. Numbers 218, 156, 32, 99, 232, 12, 102, 172, and 84 successively bought in. Xinyi's rise became aggressive as the public absorbed the shares. Xingguang also rose sharply. The market sentiment was quite good, and the price rebounded to 2760 yuan. Numbers 97, 180, 142, 102, 36, 143, and 57 were all sold, causing the price to retreat slightly to 2680 yuan. Numbers 97, 156, and 154 still bought in, remaining stable until the close. Jinglun reached its limit, and Xinyi closed at a high price. As a result, Yongsha, Mei Ya, Huazhong, Zhongfa, and Xinhua rose slightly compared to the previous close. Mei Ya still fell by 0.5%. Among the less active stocks, Jinglun reached its limit. Zhongs fell to its limit in the morning, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. Compared to the listed price, it remained stable. Xinya recovered to slightly less than 0.5%. Rongfeng rose by another 10%. Matches and Lilian remained flat. Underwear declined slightly, while the rest rose slightly. Outside the market, all stocks remained stable except for Dasheng, which continued to be oversupplied and fell further.

### Bond Market Sentiment Excited　Unified C Bonds Surge 20%

Yesterday, the bond market was excited by the news of the National Army entering Yan'an, and trading was lively, reaching 15 million yuan. It did not close until after 12:00 PM. Unified C bonds opened in the morning at 12,000 yuan, and fell to a low of 11,200 yuan. However, after being absorbed by outside funds and with the help of financial institutions, they rebounded to 13,200 yuan, and then settled slightly. As a result, A, B, D, and E bonds rose by 1,500 yuan each compared to the previous close, while Unified C bonds rose by 2,600 yuan alone.

### Foreign Stocks Decline

Foreign stocks continued to be weak yesterday. With the smooth progress of the military operations and the stability of public sentiment, foreign traders actively supplied stocks. Yisha opened in the morning at 16,900 yuan and fell to 16,400 yuan. Securities firms maintained the price by buying at low prices and rebounding to 17,300 yuan. The market was quite stable in the afternoon. As a result, Paper declined by slightly more than 0.5% compared to the previous close. Yisha and Yinglian declined slightly. Yipi and Shipping rose slightly. Jardine Matheson, Ye Guang, and Steel remained flat.

### Rice Market Forms Balanced Situation

Yesterday, a total of over 12,000 dan of rice arrived from the north and south. Both the northern and southern markets for japonica rice remained stable, and the situation was temporarily balanced. Indica rice, however, was weakened by 1,000 yuan. Since the market in the southern district of Yinyuan became sluggish, it declined by 2,000 yuan. In the northern district, the market was thriving due to the dryness of the rice, and prices were firm, resulting in a complete reversal of fortunes.

The arrival of flour continued, and prices remained stable. Bran was in short supply and weak. The arrival of oil continued, and sales were balanced, with no temporary fluctuations and a stable situation. Soybean cake was quiet and sales were slow, slightly weaker by 200-300 yuan. Soybeans tended to meander, with both oil mills and local merchants having a weak appetite. Green beans were faint. Red sorghum was rare and the situation was stable.

The sales of red beans from Guangdong remained sluggish, and prices remained at the original levels. Corn gradually decreased and fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan. Broad beans were sold piecemeal and were not vigorous, retreating by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were weak at first but then settled, with high prices for the best quality and sluggish sales for the second grade. Sesame was continuously absorbed by foreign firms, resulting in high prices for the best quality and flat prices for the second grade.

### Rayon Prices Fall　Silk Fabric Trading Very Small

Due to limited actual sales, rayon prices fell again yesterday. Gaoshan Rayon No. 120 opened small in the morning, shouting 6.35 million yuan, but no one was interested. It retreated to 250,000 yuan at noon before closing. There were one or two transactions in the afternoon, and prices rebounded again, shouting 300,000 to 350,000 yuan. As a result, it was still 100,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Siyang Cargo Rayon No. 75, semi-glossy, had a transaction yesterday at 10.7 million yuan. Regarding factory silk, there was a transaction of 10 bundles of C-grade silk at 7.1 million yuan, slightly lower than the shouted price two days ago. There were several other transactions of ordinary silk, with prices of 6.5 million yuan for slightly flawed silk. Transactions of plain silk were rare. The number of silk fabric transactions was very small. Dachen Ge Ten Bi crepe was shouted at 6,600 yuan yesterday, 200 yuan less than the previous day, while the rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn Prices Fall Initially, Then Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market fell initially and then rose. In the early morning, it continued the weakness of the previous day and continued to decline. In addition, some replica factories, lacking funds, secretly sold the goods they had obtained from the Spinning and Weaving Construction Company the previous day, causing prices to fall by more than 100,000 yuan. Lightweight Shuangma had a lowest price of 3.3 million yuan. However, as fellow merchants absorbed the cheaper goods and Tianjin merchants came to purchase, the prices of various yarn counts stopped falling and rebounded. At the close, Shuangma was at 3.4 million yuan and Hong Kui Xing was at 3.45 million yuan, stabilizing the market.

### Hong Kong Woolen Fabric Shipped to Shanghai

The sales of woolen fabric have continued to become more active recently, due to the warm weather and the rising demand for Western and Chinese clothing. The woolen fabric shops along Qipan Street are all bustling with retail business every day. The evening clothing stores along Linsen Road, Daxin Street, Sichuan Road, and Jing'an Temple Road are also experiencing increasing sales and orders. Direct and indirect wholesale transactions among tea parties, large wholesalers, and factories have also seen sudden progress. However, since woolen fabric cannot currently be imported to the port, local factories are taking the opportunity to hoard and increase prices. Shipments from Hong Kong have continued to arrive, as there is still a profit to be made. Many insiders and outsiders are going to Hong Kong to purchase. It is said that some giants in the woolen fabric business have been contacting each other in Hong Kong to set up shop and handle goods.

### Cotton Cloth Market Weak

Yesterday, the dissemination of the news of the National Army's victory caused speculation in the cotton cloth market to dissipate. Moreover, because cloth prices in other ports were lower than those in Shanghai, merchants were selling their stocks on the market, and new buyers were frequently selling their purchases. Dye factories also showed less interest. As a result, shouted prices were nominally lower. 12-pound Longtou Fine dropped slightly to 157,500 yuan. Wu Lai Fine Cloth dropped sharply by 4,000 yuan to 152,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths, such as Blue Chicken, Blue Phoenix, Yanghe, and Caiqiu, also fell by 1,000-2,000 yuan each. Blue Cloth, Yuan Cloth, Mercerized Cloth, and Serge also retreated by 1,000-2,000 yuan to 4,000-5,000 yuan. Only Tulin Cloth remained unchanged. The Spinning and Weaving Construction Company continued to supply various cloths as usual. The listed price for plain cloth was 141,000 yuan for the Hong Longtou variety.

### Domestic Wool Textile Factories　Using Shandong Wool

According to people in the fur trade: After the import of Australian wool was restricted, domestic wool textile factories have increasingly adopted Shandong wool. Therefore, recently exported wool has all been Huzhou Tang wool, and there is no longer much Shandong wool being exported. The finer and softer Shandong wool can be used for spinning woolen fabric, while the coarser part can still be used for woolen thread and various woolen underwear. If Huzhou wool, which is harvested in the spring from young sheep (i.e., sheep that have not been pregnant), can be used for spinning as well, the quantity will not be as much as Shandong wool. If prices in the producing areas can remain stable, domestic use is expected to gradually become more prosperous.

### Raising Deposit Interest Rates　Does Not Easily Attract Deposits

There was a previous rumor that the Central Bank would adjust deposit interest rates to attract floating capital. According to sources from the four major banks: The interest rates of commercial banks in China are already extremely high, reaching about 8%. No commercial banks in the world currently have such high interest rates, but there has been no large increase in deposits. As for the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, their interest rates are set according to the regulations of the national bank, and their loans are limited to general production enterprises. Although they spare no effort in attracting floating capital, they have not seen good results. Currently, the amount of deposits in banks across the country is still lower than before the war, only reaching one-fifth to one-tenth of the pre-war level. If the total amount of deposits in commercial banks is now 300 billion, and converted at a rate of 10,000 times the pre-war level, it is only 30 million yuan. Even if we add another 20 times, it is only 60 million yuan. Pre-war deposits were much higher than this. Therefore, raising interest rates to attract deposits is not effective. The most important thing is still to stabilize prices and eliminate the black market. When the market fluctuates less, floating capital can gradually return to the proper channels, and bank deposits can naturally increase.

### At the Tea Conference　Agricultural Bank of China Presents Three Points　Tea Merchants Hope Government Actively Subsidizes Production

[Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to plan for this year's tea loans, the Agricultural Bank of China convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, inviting representatives from the China Tea Association, the Tea Export Association, and the Southeast Tea Region Factories Association. More than a dozen tea merchant representatives attended, including Tang Jisan, Shou Jingwei, Ye Shichang, Hong Runzhi, and Wu Juenong. Wang Botian, manager of the Agricultural Bank of China, and Zhou Jiyao, deputy manager, presided over the meeting.

The Agricultural Bank of China immediately presented three points: (1) Reviewing last year's tea loans, due to time constraints, nationwide promotion was not possible, and there were omissions in the tea regions and factories in the interior. The Bank will improve and supplement this year. (2) Last year's tea production rate was quite slow. The time from tea selection to transportation to Shanghai for export was too long. In the past, when transportation was convenient, Qihong and Tunlv teas were shipped to Shanghai for export in early August, and tea merchants could return home before the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, last year, tea was still being shipped to Shanghai until winter and the end of the year, delaying the time for the country to earn foreign exchange, and causing tea merchants to bear additional interest, increasing production costs. (3) In order to promote nationwide tea loans, the Agricultural Bank of China conducted a general registration in various producing areas, and the number of tea merchants in various places has increased to 1,600. Last year, the government instructed the Agricultural Bank of China to handle tea loans, focusing on Shanghai. However, it is difficult for the Shanghai branch to manage the entire tea loan business. Therefore, this year, it is hoped that tea merchants in various places will actively contact the branches of the Agricultural Bank of China in the producing areas, so as to actively increase tea production and earn foreign exchange. Subsequently, tea merchants from Fujian, Shanghai, and Ningzhou regions expressed their opinions, generally hoping that the government would actively subsidize tea merchants' production, but also hoping that tea merchants would not overly rely on subsidies. At the same time, they hoped that the Agricultural Bank of China could actively support tea farmers and help the country earn foreign exchange. The Agricultural Bank of China decided to collect the tea merchants' opinions and file them. Next Tuesday, Zhou Jiyao will take them to Nanjing to report to the head office of the Agricultural Bank of China, and submit them to the tea loan business meeting of the head office of the Agricultural Bank of China for discussion next Wednesday.

### Methods of Repayment to the Soviet Union　Not Yet Decided This Year

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The amount of China's repayment for this year in the Sino-Soviet barter agreement is still under consideration by the competent authorities. According to this barter agreement, which began during the Battle of Wuhan, the Soviet Union supplied China with various weapons and fuels, totaling more than 200 million US dollars. As for China's repayment method, it was stipulated that agricultural and mineral resources would each account for half, to be repaid in installments until 1952. At the beginning of repayment, the Resources Committee handled the repayment of mineral products, and the Trade Committee handled the repayment of agricultural products. Later, the transportation of agricultural products to the Soviet Union was handled by the China Tea Company and the Fuxing Company respectively. After the victory, it was handled by the China Trust Bureau. Last year, under difficult financial circumstances, China made great efforts to repay 10.3 million US dollars each of agricultural and mineral resources, which was quite strenuous. As for the amount of repayment this year, the Soviet Union certainly hopes for more, but China's intention is to absolutely respect its credit, but at the same time, it needs to weigh China's financial situation and act according to its ability. Moreover, since the victory, a large amount of materials in Northeast China has been moved away by the Soviet army, causing huge losses, and currently the transportation of industrial and agricultural materials in Northeast China continues to be lost, with no compensation methods. Under these circumstances, the decision on China's repayment method to the Soviet Union this year may still be pending.

### Director of Salt Administration, Miao Qiujie, Discusses　Current Situation of Salt Production and Sales　New Salt Policy Can Promote Production

According to Miao Qiujie, Director of the Salt Administration, after the implementation of the new policy of people-made, people-transported, people-sold, and government-managed salt, salt production can be promoted. If production expands, costs will definitely be reduced, which will benefit the development of the chemical industry. The current free transportation and sale of salt will enable high-quality, low-priced salt to be widely sold. For example, the southwestern provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou have always relied on Sichuan salt. Now, Huai salt has been sold in Hunan and Hubei, and it will soon be possible for the lower part of eastern Sichuan to sell Huai salt. The quality of Zigong salt in Sichuan Province is very good, but because of the limited production and high costs, it will be less competitive. The Zigong salt field is currently working on improving production, replacing manual labor with machinery, and improving technology with science. If it can increase production and reduce costs, it can still control the southwestern market. As for China's salt reserves, the highest estimate is 120 million dan. According to nearly 30 years of continuous research and improvement in production, the total amount of salt production in the country is about 60 million dan. 90% is consumed for food, with 40 million dan for civilian salt, 10 million dan for fish salt, and only 2-3 million dan for industrial salt. The amount of salt for export this year for barter with Japan is 780,000 dan. The amount of civilian salt consumed varies depending on the wealth of the region. The average amount per person per month in the Northwest and North China is only eight taels, while in the West it is nearly one catty, and in the Southeast it is two catties (including various salted foods and ordinary industrial salt). In contrast, the amount of salt sold in advanced industrial countries is much greater than the amount of salt used in China. In Japan, with a population of 80 million, about 30 million dan of salt were sold annually before the war, and the sales volume in the United States was even greater, estimated at more than 15 kilograms per person per month, because their industry, agriculture, and heavy and light industries are very developed.

### Export Tea Lacks Improvement

Various domestic teas were still being purchased by native merchants and Wuxi merchants yesterday. The market situation was good but powerless and continued to be in a dormant state. As for export varieties, most holders of goods who were feeling tight on money did not continue to sell, and buyers were still suppressing prices, so the situation was still floating. Although the market did not continue to decline, the footing may be difficult to stabilize. It is understood that the industry is currently worried about the imminent arrival of the new tea production season this year. There is no good solution to the huge amount of old tea accumulated in 1946, so they are planning to appeal to the authorities for a solution.

### Export Goods　US Market Flat and Weak

Cable from the National Foreign Department of the Bank of China, New York, dated the 18th: The market conditions in the US market for our native products are as follows: Raw silk and tung oil are stable. Tianjin's long bristles are offered at $7, and short bristles are at $4.2, which is weak. Chongqing bristles are $2.5, Shanghai bristles are $2.5, and Hankou bristles are $3.8. The market situation is calm. Sausage casings have a transaction at $0.55. Yellow wolf skin is $2.5 for 18 inches, and $1.4 for 15 inches. Huzhou sheepskin is $1.3, all of which are weak. There were no changes in other products.

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Sausage casings: The New York market is still weak, but transactions have become more active, and the price of sausage casings in this city has stabilized. The purchase price of fresh casings has risen slightly, to 1,200 yuan per set.

Pig bristles: Shanghai bristles are still firm, while Sichuan and Han bristles have risen slightly. According to reports from New York, Shanghai bristles are still stable, while Sichuan and Han bristles have not escaped the weak trend, and Tianjin bristles are even weaker.

### Tung Oil Arrivals Relatively Scarce　Market Situation No Significant Change

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Tung oil arrivals are continuous but not abundant. It is understood that this time the tung oil was purchased from the producing areas by Zhongzhi Factory, Yuanlai, Dalai, Henghe, and others, and shipped to Shanghai for export. The market situation yesterday remained unchanged.

### High Prices in Producing Areas

According to tung oil exporters, recent tung oil prices in the producing areas have not softened. The cost of transporting to Shanghai is 390,000 to 400,000 yuan per dan, and the export price, excluding transportation, taxes, and insurance, is already lower than the cost. Foreign markets: London's price is £220 per ton, which is equivalent to 440,000 yuan per dan. New York's price for bulk is 36 cents US dollars per pound, which is equivalent to 480,000 yuan per dan. France's price per ton is equivalent to 8.6 million US dollars, which is equivalent to 516,000 yuan per dan.

### Fir Wood Arrivals Abundant　Foreign Pine Prices Soften

[Reported by Our Newspaper] More than 7 million feet of Fujian fir wood strips arrived yesterday. The market situation is weak. The price of large strips was 980 yuan per foot yesterday, and the price of small strips was 880 yuan, which is close to the cost. Arrivals of foreign pine were abundant. A large part was used as railway sleepers, with 100,000 to 200,000 feet being transported out every day, but the domestic sales were quite sluggish, and the price was softening, ranging from 3,600 yuan to 3,800 yuan per foot.

### Sugar Price Adjustment

[Report from our Newspaper] The 17th meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Sugar Price Review Committee was held at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. The resolution was made to adjust sugar prices as follows: (1) Special Grade Granulated White Sugar: 3,100 yuan per pound; (2) Grade 1 Granulated White Sugar: 2,700 yuan per pound; (3) Grade 2 Granulated White Sugar: 2,500 yuan per pound; (4) Special Grade Cotton White Sugar: 3,400 yuan per pound; (5) Grade 1 Cotton White Sugar: 2,300 yuan per pound; (6) Brown Sugar: 1,000 yuan per pound.

### Insufficient Raw Material Sources, Reduced Production of Sulfurized Yuan, Many Dye Intermediates Should be Allowed for Import

[Report from our Newspaper] According to an investigation by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: The products of dye factories in this city are mainly sulfurized yuan. There are about 50 factories in the city. Among them, 14 are of a relatively larger scale, with a total maximum daily output of 865 barrels (60 kilograms per barrel). In addition, there are more than 30 scattered small factories (shipping 23 or 56 barrels per day), with a total daily output of 1,000 barrels of sulfurized yuan. This amount can be self-sufficient without the need for foreign imports. Currently, due to a shortage of raw materials, production has decreased, and the actual output is less than 300 barrels. If raw materials can be supplied steadily, each factory can exert its full capacity. It is found that the average annual consumption of sulfurized yuan before the war was about 400,000 dan. At that time, in addition to the 100,000 dan produced domestically, about 300,000 dan were imported from foreign countries. It is found that among the raw materials for manufacturing sulfurized yuan, dinitrochlorobenzene or monochlorobenzene, and carbolic acid cannot be produced domestically. Although caustic soda, sodium sulfide, sodium nitrate, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid can be produced domestically, their output is insufficient. Sulfur used to come from Hunan, but now it is impossible to transport it to Shanghai due to inconvenient transportation, so factories mostly use imported sulfur flowers. The industry hopes that the government will facilitate imports, and the import of sulfurized yuan can be completely prohibited.

According to the investigation, the raw materials required for manufacturing 1,000 barrels of sulfurized yuan per day are: 24,000 kilograms of dinitrochlorobenzene, or alternatively 20,000 kilograms of monochlorobenzene and nitric acid and sulfuric acid, or alternatively 20,000 kilograms of carbolic acid and nitric acid and sulfuric acid, 24,000 kilograms of sodium sulfide (60%), 24,000 kilograms of sulfur, 10,000 kilograms of caustic soda, 36,000 kilograms of nitric acid (98%), or alternatively 72,000 kilograms of sodium nitrate (96%), 65,000 kilograms of sulfuric acid (when using nitric acid), or 100,000 kilograms (when using sodium nitrate). The raw materials required for manufacturing other dyes mostly rely on imports, especially dye intermediates. Therefore, the following dye intermediates should be allowed for import: Dinitrochorobenzene,Phenol,Monochlorobenzene,Benziline　Base,Toluedine　Base,Dianisidine　Base,R-Salt,G-Salt,H-Acid,NaphthionicAcid,P-Hpenylenediamine,M-Phenylenediamine,P-Naphthol,Aniline,Aniline　Salt,Dinitrotoulene,P-SulfonililcAcid,N-W　Acid,Meta-Xylidine,P-Nitrohiline

### Taiwan Sugar Arrives

According to consensus from the Taiwan Sugar side, after the Taiwan incident occurred, the export of Taiwan sugar was once halted. It is now learned that transportation has resumed, and 2,000 tons of Taiwan sugar arrived yesterday, which will supply the rationing needs of public educators in Beijing and Shanghai.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Physicians' Right to Participate in Politics

— Song Guobin

Physicians and politics seem like unrelated matters, but upon careful consideration, they are actually closely related. Because in today's politicized health, all political measures are inextricably linked to medicine and health. It is only because Chinese doctors have always held the spirit of "modest gentlemen" and the attitude of "gentlemen do not contend," maintaining their purity and refraining from speaking about politics, that power has fallen into the hands of others, and they gradually come to believe that medicine and politics are unrelated. Society and the nation view it this way, and doctors themselves also view it this way. Everyone only knows that medicine is a free profession, without broad political rights. Looking at this National Assembly, in the entire country, there are only two representatives of new medicine! How regrettable it would be to not participate in the government and prepare for the five Yuan!

Physicians have dual qualifications in the nation: one is as a citizen, and the other is as a physician. Therefore, they have the right to be elected in both regional and occupational elections. Now, according to the National Assembly election regulations, physicians are included in occupational groups, but they do not participate in regional elections, and the number of occupational candidates is extremely small. A single person is weak, and isolation leads to no support. Seeking to expand medical rights would be going in the opposite direction. Therefore, participating in regional elections and increasing the number of occupational candidates elected are what our medical community should strive for.

Our country's Legislative Yuan is equivalent to foreign parliaments, and physicians account for a considerable percentage of foreign parliament members. However, there is not a single physician participating in our country's Legislative Yuan. All medical laws and regulations should be created by the Legislative Yuan to fulfill the name of legislation. However, because the Yuan lacks specialized talent, the Health Department has to handle everything. After the Health Department formulates them, they still need to be passed by the Legislative Yuan to comply with legislative procedures. However, since there is no specialized talent in the Legislative Yuan, it is impossible to judge their merits or demerits, and they are hastily passed, which is inevitable. The current Medical Practitioner Law, which is unsatisfactory and has many shortcomings, is an example. Therefore, having a certain number of representatives participating in the Legislative Yuan is the second thing our medical community should strive for.

Our country implements a five-Yuan system, but physicians are only part of the Executive Yuan's Health Department, and do not participate in other Yuan or departments. In fact, other departments and Yuan have many events related to medical affairs, and physicians should also be involved. For example, the physician examinations of the Examination Yuan and the examinations for public officials of health agencies in various regions should be administered by physicians. In medical litigation cases of the Judicial Yuan, medical forensic identification cannot be insightful and fair without the participation of physicians. In medical education, health education, school health, and medical work, the Ministry of Education should have physicians involved. In health insurance, factory hygiene, labor accidents, and infant care, the Ministry of Social Affairs should have physicians involved. In international epidemic prevention, travel quarantine, and medical equipment for the army, navy, and air force, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of National Defense cannot be separated from the guidance of physicians. These are too numerous to list. Therefore, participating in the work of various ministries and Yuan is the third thing our medical community should strive for.

The ancients said, "If you cannot be a good prime minister, be a good doctor," which shows that medicine and politics have a considerable relationship, and this has been the case since ancient times. Today, the wave of democracy is rising, and civil rights are expanding. I say this not because I am eager for fame and fortune, but to conform to the meaning of democracy.

### A Strange Story of Infant Poisoning from Medicated Ointment

— Wu Manqing

There are really many strange and unbelievable things happening in the world. Based on ordinary reasoning, it should not happen, but it did. What can we do? We can only say it is a strange story. For example, external medicinal ointment, what is so important about applying it on the skin? But it actually killed someone, and it was a very common 2.5% Resorcin ointment. Isn't this strange? The facts are as follows:

Danish physician Dr. Lund reported a case saying that a two-month-old infant suffering from a skin disease had Resorcin ointment applied four times in three days, with a concentration of 2.5%. Since using this medicine, the infant gradually lost weight, had no appetite, and passed black urine. In less than a few days, the skin all over the body showed a bluish-purple color, which later turned yellow, and finally died of dyspnea and heart failure. An autopsy was performed immediately after the child's death. The results showed an abnormally swollen spleen, blood in all internal organs as dark red as pig liver, fatty changes in the liver, and complete tissue collapse in the entire kidney. These phenomena are all symptoms of Resorcin poisoning. Dr. Lund also mentioned that there have been several similar cases reported in the literature of various countries around the world. (See the German Journal of Forensic Medicine, Volume 20, Issue 1, 1932.)

From the above case, even with very common ointments, we cannot use them casually. For example, ointments such as sulfathiazole often have many side effects, and we must pay attention. Recently, a physician reported that prolonged use of sulfathiazole ointment on the skin can cause a sensitivity reaction in the patient's body. If a relatively large dose of sulfathiazole is taken internally or injected, the patient may die from poisoning. Just look at it, an ordinary ointment, but the result can be such a significant danger, which is not just a strange story, but a major warning to us doctors!

### Methods to Reduce Fever in Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Liang Junqing

Whether it is a patient or a doctor, we all know that fever in pulmonary tuberculosis is very difficult to reduce. Because fever is a natural phenomenon in our body to resist disease. If there is no way to deal with the disease, then its fever phenomenon will naturally not be easy to reduce. We all know that pulmonary tuberculosis is a very difficult disease to treat (there is still no specific medicine), so we are naturally very troubled by the fever in pulmonary tuberculosis. To be honest, we simply have no way to think of it except to teach patients to rest quietly and use some symptomatic methods.

With nearly ten years of experience, I have used the method of Tenkate Hoedemaker to cure many fevers in the middle of pulmonary tuberculosis, especially effective for pulmonary tuberculosis in children. I am now introducing it here. Its prescription is as follows: Acid. arsenic. 0,01 Acidetylsalic. 10,0 Amyl.x.s.m.j.pil. No 100. The dosage is one pill three times a day after each meal, then add one pill every day (not one pill each time) until a total of thirty pills a day, then gradually reduce one pill every day. When dispensing the medicine, the pharmacist must be instructed to evenly distribute the amount of arsenic, and never prepare it casually, so as to avoid uneven portions and poisoning! This prescription was published in the Vienna Medical Weekly, No. 12, 1930. Relying on this prescription, I have indeed made a lot of contributions.

However, the efficacy of this prescription also has its failures, because it is also useless for progressive pulmonary tuberculosis (ie, confluent tuberculosis or caseous tuberculosis). It only has its unique efficacy for fibrosis or sclerosing pulmonary tuberculosis and fever in tuberculosis of the hilar lymph nodes.

Recently, many newspapers and magazines are promoting the efficacy of the new specific medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis, "Streptomycin," but there are also many publications commenting on its shortcomings. Although we are not necessarily opposed to a new drug, we dare not rashly approve of it, because we doctors seem to be loaches practicing Taoism, cautiously fearing that it will not become a dragon. We only allow for a thousand days of goodness, but not one day of badness. Who among us would dare to risk trying a drug without certainty? (Because the package insert for "Streptomycin" still states "This time has not yet matured in the treatment of tuberculosis, and cannot be introduced.")

So, is there really no way to deal with fever in acute (ie, infiltrative) pulmonary tuberculosis? Yes, according to my personal experience, I think there is. Because I have achieved very good results in six or seven cases. What is this method? It's very simple, it's sulfonamide preparations.

Originally, sulfonamide preparations are the holy medicine for treating coccus diseases. It can cure many diseases caused by cocci. However, it is not effective against tuberculosis bacilli. This is a fact that many doctors have obtained in clinical practice and cannot be denied. However, although it does not have the ability to eliminate tuberculosis bacteria, it does have the effect of inhibiting the activity of tuberculosis bacteria. There have been many similar reports in magazines in Europe and the United States, and there is no need for me to reiterate them. According to my personal experience, in the febrile stage of progressive tuberculosis, we may inject 5 cc of 30% sulfathiazole solution plus 10 cc or 20 cc of 25% glucose solution intravenously, once a day, which can often reduce the temperature. Although its therapeutic effect is not obvious, we can at least imagine the following two effects:

(1) The effect of eradicating mixed bacteria. We must know that people who have pulmonary tuberculosis can certainly also have other bacteria (such as pneumonia, cocci, staphylococci, and streptococci) in their trachea and lungs at the same time. If a patient has many kinds of bacteria in the body at the same time, then his disease must be more serious, and his temperature is also higher. Now, if the other cocci in his lungs are eradicated, then his temperature can naturally be reduced.

(2) The effect of inhibiting the activity of tuberculosis bacteria. Many experts have proven in the laboratory that sulfonamide preparations have the ability to inhibit the activity of tuberculosis bacteria, but no concrete proof has been obtained in the human body. However, according to my personal experience, it does have the ability to inhibit the activity of tuberculosis bacteria, because no other bacteria were detected in the sputum of four patients.

Based on the above reasons, I specifically introduce this method of reducing fever. As for its side effects, it can be said to be very few. However, I have to declare that after implementing this method, we must give the patient a large amount of nicotinic acid preparations to reduce its side effects, and we must often check the patient's white blood cell count and red blood cell count. If the blood cell count decreases too much, or the hands and feet have numbness, then this method must be stopped to avoid poisoning.

Although there are not many real examples of this method, it is indeed effective and has few disadvantages, so it is specially publicly introduced as above.

### Review of Treating Tuberculosis with "Streptomycin" (Continued and Completed)

— Yang Shida

(9) Usage, Dosage, and Toxicity of "Streptomycin"

For the treatment of tuberculosis in adults, the currently adopted dose is 1 to 3 grams every 24 hours, divided into four to six doses, one dose every four to six hours, administered by deep subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. For the injection solution, each cc contains 100 to 250 mg of "Streptomycin," and sterile distilled water can be used as the dissolving solution. For solutions used for compresses or sprays, 25 to 100 mg of "Streptomycin" per cc is sufficient. For the preparation of spinal cavity injection solution (for tuberculous meningitis), 100 to 200 mg of "Streptomycin" can be dissolved in 1 to 5 cc of spinal fluid, or isotonic saline can also be used.

Regarding the treatment of tuberculous ulcers in the upper respiratory tract, local spraying and injection methods should be carried out simultaneously. To prepare the spray solution, 0.5 grams of "Streptomycin" can be dissolved in 20 cc of saline, sprayed 2 cc per hour, and sprayed 10 times a day.

"Streptomycin" needs to be used for a long time during the treatment of tuberculosis. Although its response is not yet fully understood, it cannot be ignored. Therefore, the use of "Streptomycin" should be avoided in cases where other therapies can be used and the same effect can be obtained. As for progressive tuberculosis, which cannot be effectively treated with general therapies, there is no need to miss the opportunity to use it. The most common and most uncomfortable reactions of "Streptomycin" are impaired body balance, loss of response of the vestibular organs to thermal stimulation, and the eighth cranial nerve (auditory nerve) is often affected by the toxin of "Streptomycin," and hearing can also be impaired. According to Ying Xiao's opinion, when balance is impaired, "Streptomycin" treatment does not need to be stopped, because experience tells him that after prolonged treatment, the phenomenon of balance impairment will recover. Other toxic phenomena are mostly due to impure products and are no longer a problem.

Conclusion

"Streptomycin" is an antibacterial agent with the unique ability to inhibit the development of tuberculosis bacteria in the human body, which has been confirmed both in experiments and in clinical practice. The manifestation of tuberculosis bacteria should be eliminated in experimental animals or in the human body. At least, based on the observation of others, the pathological progression will be temporarily delayed.

In most cases, "Streptomycin" is considered more capable of suppressing tuberculosis than of curing it. At the tissue drug concentration currently available, "Streptomycin" appears to be a bacteriostatic agent, not a completely bactericidal agent.

"Streptomycin" deserves wider use in various types of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Because in two years, Ying Xiao and others tried it on one hundred cases of tuberculosis, and the results obtained were quite certain and satisfactory. The treatment of tuberculosis requires long-term use of large amounts of "Streptomycin" (1 to 3 grams). If the effective total amount cannot be prepared for use in a set completed in two to four months, then this treatment should not be adopted. (Total amount is about 360 grams or more)

In most patients, long-term treatment is required, and the toxic manifestation of "Streptomycin" should also be considered. Imbalance of the body is the most frequently encountered phenomenon, and often persists even after treatment is stopped for several weeks.

For tuberculosis patients whose condition is gradually improving, or whose general treatment can have an effect, the use of "Streptomycin" should often be postponed or abandoned, because this medicine cannot be considered a substitute for other effective treatments. (End)

Respected Inquiry regarding vaccination, is it a people’s obligation or a people’s right? My humble opinion: first, from a legal point of view, it can be regarded as the people’s obligation.

Respected Inquiry regarding vaccination, is it a people’s obligation or a people’s right? My humble opinion: first, from a legal point of view, it can be regarded as the people’s obligation. Because in the laws of various countries regarding vaccination and prevention of smallpox, there are provisions for regular vaccination and temporary vaccination. Regular vaccination refers to vaccination after birth and vaccination at the age of military service. Temporary vaccination refers to areas where smallpox is prevalent, and everyone must be vaccinated again, regardless of how many times they have been vaccinated before. As such, all people should unconditionally comply. Otherwise, it is illegal and should be subject to certain punishments. Because it is stipulated by law, it is a people's obligation. Second, from the perspective of health theory, it can also be regarded as a right of life. Because everyone is born with a right to health, which cannot be denied. All facilities that protect health and prevent disease should be enjoyed by everyone. Although the measure of vaccination may not be recognized by everyone as a kind of enjoyment, some neurotic people may regard vaccination with a knife and small thorns as terrifying. However, vaccination can indeed prevent the transmission of smallpox; that is, immunity to resist smallpox will be generated in the body after vaccination. The production of this immunity is beneficial to health; then the result of vaccination is a kind of enjoyment in the broad sense. Therefore, it can also be said that vaccination is a right of life.

(2) Reply to Mr. Cen Zhiliang

Regarding the measles problem, the following is a summary of what can be replied:

(1) In addition to direct contact with infected people and being infected, this disease can also be indirectly transmitted through objects, such as utensils, toys, clothing, etc. Not only can objects be the medium, but even healthy people can carry the virus and act as a medium of transmission in the dark.

(2) Although it is most prevalent in the winter and spring seasons in the Shanghai area, there is no absolute seasonal restriction. According to the entire statistics, there are also many cases of this disease in the summer and autumn seasons.

(3) There is currently no effective method that can be introduced to prevent those who have not yet been infected. If necessary, use adult serum as a preventive injection. It is best to take the serum of patients in the recovery period, which is naturally more reliable.

(4) Other infectious diseases should be isolated as soon as possible to prevent them from spreading into an epidemic; this disease does not seem possible. Because it is prevalent throughout the year, one rises after another, it is difficult to completely eradicate it. Moreover, it is generally recognized that there is absolute immunity after one illness. If the physique is not weak, it may be possible to let it be infected once to avoid future troubles. Those who are physically weak and under the age of three should move away as soon as possible to prevent infection to be safe.

(5) Measles is also a kind of acute infectious disease. Ordinary pediatric hospitals will naturally refuse to admit them. But if you send them to an infectious disease hospital, you will definitely not be refused. I hope you will not be misunderstood because of this. (Bingli)

Spring and Autumn

### Mother and Son

— Liam O'Flaherty, Translated by Li Mengfei

— The greatness of maternal love is like the brilliant sunlight.

Although it was only five o'clock, the sun had already set. Dusk was as quiet and silent as all spring evenings. The birds were beginning to sing lullabies to themselves or tell each other bedtime stories. The village was quiet. The men had finished their sowing work in the morning and had now gone out to prepare to catch fresh fish at night. The women had also gone to the small fields among the mountain rocks to milk the cows.

Bai Liqi stayed at home alone, waiting for her young son to return from school. But it had been an hour after school let out, and he still hadn't come back. She was truly worried about her nine-year-old child, especially since he was her only son. He was a very wild child, often causing havoc, skipping school, going fishing on Sundays, or climbing on high mountain rocks to build fortresses with stones... She thought to herself, she would have to scold him and beat him when he stepped through the door. At the same time, her anxious heart was beating even harder, and every sound made her jump. She had to hurry to the door and look down the winding road. As the evening grew darker, something might have happened to her young child.

His dinner consisted of dried fish and roasted sweet potatoes, which were kept warm in the peat ash by the stove. There was a plate, a knife, and a small cup full of buttermilk on the table.

Finally, she heard the joyful shouts of schoolchildren in the distance, and she hurried out the door. She saw their small figures running wildly, not along the road, but on the rocks to the left of the road, all holding their hats in their hands.

"Thank God," she said. She knew she was full of anger, and she hurriedly grabbed a dry willow branch, sat in the chair inside the door, and waited for her young son, Stan Lau.

He slowly walked up the square, approaching the fence of the vegetable garden. He was a rosy-cheeked, petite boy, wearing gray wool trousers that almost covered his knees. He had a tightly fitting blue thick woolen sweater on his upper body. His bare feet were covered in mud. His large, soft blue eyes were staring out in fear on his sweaty face. He knew his mother would be very angry.

He finally stepped into the doorway, lowered his head, and stepped into the kitchen. His mother, who was sitting in the chair, immediately jumped up and grabbed his shoulder. The child cried out sharply, his schoolbag and hat fell to the ground, and he hugged his mother's skirt. His mother raised the willow branch to strike him, but when she saw the small, shivering child, she couldn't help but tremble herself. She threw away the willow branch, bent down, picked him up, and began to kiss him, her eyes filled with tears, and she couldn't help but cry.

"What happened to you, what happened? May God protect us, I don't have the courage to hit you, but you are too unrestrained, you make me too sad." The child sobbed, burying his head in his mother's arms.

"Go," she said, pushing him away a little, "go and eat dinner. This morning your father wanted to give you a good beating. Every time I begged him to spare you, it was over. But this time I will no longer plead for you. You make me too sad, too sad. Come, come here and eat dinner."

She put dinner on the plate and told the child to sit on the chair. He sat down and was still sobbing, but after a while, he wiped his tears with his sleeve and began to devour his food. Gradually, his face showed a joyful color, his small bottom moved on the chair, and he sat more comfortably. A dinner that filled his hungry stomach made him forget all the fear of his mother just now and the beating he would receive tomorrow morning. The mother sat on the doorstep, quietly knitting, her loving eyes watching him with her long black eyelashes.

All her anger had now completely disappeared, and she felt very happy because she had taken over the responsibilities that her husband had to do. However, she still had to maintain her sternness. Although she wanted to ask Stephan what he had been doing, she always remained silent. Finally, she couldn't resist and opened her mouth.

### An Analysis of Greek Mythology

— Ding Nianzhuang

Greek mythology has been analyzed by many theorists, and there are various different explanations. Now let's take a look at what a group of linguists mean. They believe that all myths are natural phenomena—for example: heaven, earth, sun, moon, dawn, night, ocean, etc.

The myths about the sun and dawn are the most numerous. The first story is that Jupiter transformed into a bull and took away Europa, the princess of Phoenicia. Later, her brother Cadmus went to find her, but he never found her. In this story, Europa represents the dawn, Jupiter represents the sky, and Cadmus represents the sun. The dawn travels from the east (Phoenicia) through the sky, like a girl riding on the back of a cow, but when the sun rises, the dawn immediately turns into day, so the sun never meets the dawn, just as Cadmus never finds his sister.

The second story is Apollo and Daphne. Apollo is the well-known sun god. His golden hair and handsome body drive a blazing chariot, pulled through the sky by four golden horses. He fell in love with Daphne (the daughter of the river god), but this beautiful goddess was afraid of him and ran away. When Apollo caught up with her and embraced her, her father had already granted her prayer and turned her into a tree. Daphne symbolizes dew, and when the heat of the sun dissipates into the air, the dew vanishes into thin air.

The sun god's son, Phaeton, drove his father's chariot through the sky. Because he was not used to driving, he scorched the earth. As a result, he angered the gods, and the gods struck Phaeton to death with lightning. This story represents a severe drought: flowers and plants do not grow, just like scorched earth. Phaeton's death means that the heavy rain solved the drought.

Endymion was a handsome shepherd, and the moon goddess Diana fell in love with him. Every evening, she would gently kiss him while he was asleep. Endymion represents the setting sun, and his love affair with the moon goddess represents the rising and falling of the sun and moon. According to the great linguist Muller, when people use the ancient poetic Elis dialect to say "Diana loves Endymion, she is looking at him," it means "It is getting late." If they say "Diana is embracing Endymion," it means "The sun is setting and the moon is rising." If they say "Diana is kissing Endymion," it means "It is already late!"

There are also myths about the earth. Ceres (meaning mother of all things) represents the earth. Her daughter Proserpina (spring) was taken away by Pluto, the god of the underworld, and she can only live with her for half the year. When Proserpina leaves, Ceres cries, and no new plants grow from the ground. This is the arrival of winter. When the spring of all things and the flourishing summer come, people say, "The earth mother's beautiful daughter has returned!"

The earth mother's lover is the sea god Neptune, who embraces her with his hands, so the earth is surrounded by the ocean.

The clouds are Apollo's flock of sheep. Some people also think that the sky is the blue sea, and the clouds are the ships in the blue sea. Charon's boat is also one of them. In addition, the story of Niobe also represents the changes of the clouds. Niobe is the cloud, and her children are the mist. They were all shot to death by Apollo and Diana's arrows—that is, the light of the sun and moon. Niobe wept! Her tears turned into rain, and finally she was punished and turned into a stone statue, which represents the ice on the top of the mountain.

The hero of fire is Vulcan, meaning "light in the flame." He was very small when he was born, because the fire grows from small to large. He is the blacksmith in mythology and lives in the center of the volcano. According to the Indian (Hindu) view, the god of fire and the god of marriage are the same person, so the god of marriage (Aphrodite) in Greek mythology is Vulcan's wife.

The god of wind is Mercury. He can become big or small. This symbolizes the changes of strong winds and breezes. He loves to drive the flock of sheep—the clouds—running around. He can also make music—the sound of the wind. It arouses different emotions in people—joy, sadness, regret, or hope.

### Flower

— Li Baifeng

I am a small flower. When spring comes, I unfold the petals of thought in my mind... In the cold wind of winter, my vitality decreases, my lungs shrink, and even the veins are frozen into ice. I love the sun, the sun of spring. It warms my soul—my pen, the strong roots, the manuscript paper, the fertile soil. The winter of emotion has passed. I unfold the petals of thought. I use the petals to face the sun. Then, on the manuscript paper, I bear fruit—

"Why are you back so late, Stephan?" she asked kindly.

Stephan swallowed the last bite, turned around with the cup in his hand.

"We were just playing soccer," he replied excitedly, "Then that red-haired Michel chased us, not allowing us to play soccer in his field. He wanted to drive us away, so everyone ran desperately; oh, we ran a very, very long way, but after running up the rocks, I couldn't run in front."

"Didn't I always tell you not to run to other people's fields to play soccer?"

"Oh, Mom, it wasn't me who wanted to go, it was the other kids. If I didn't go with them, they would say I was a coward, wouldn't they? Dad always tells me not to be afraid."

"Well, you listen to Dad, and you don't listen to Mom, do you? Is she not pleasing to you? If you run on the small mountain and fall and break your ankle, what am I going to do now?" She wiped away a big tear with her skirt.

Stephan left his seat, walked up to her, and put his arms around his mother's neck.

"Mom," he said, "I'll tell you what I saw in the mountains if you allow me not to tell Dad that I played soccer in Michel's field so late."

"I won't," she replied.

"Really, Mom?" he said, "I won't come back so late again, never, never, Mom."

"Okay, Stephan, what did you see, my good baby?"

He sat on the doorstep next to his mother, thoughtfully looking at the sky, his eyes gradually widening as if he were dreaming of something, and his face seemed to have an expression of mystery and surprise.

"I saw a huge black horse," he said, "flying in the sky above our heads, but none of the other kids saw it, only me, and I didn't tell them. That black horse had seven tails and three heads, and its belly was big enough to put our horses in. I saw it with both eyes. Really, Mom. Then it ran higher and higher, ran away, ran far away and couldn't be seen. Yes, I saw something so big, Mom?"

"Really, good boy." Her gentle, imaginative eyes looked towards the sky, everything was still so quiet. Then Stephan kissed her again without facing her.

"Really, you won't tell Dad?"

"Yes, baby, I won't tell."

"For sure, for sure?"

"Be quiet, child. Listen to the birds, they are starting to sing. I definitely won't tell. Listen to those beautiful birds."

The two of them sat quietly, listening as if in a dream.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 202

— Ye Jingfeng

Crane - Is there any sign of them here?

Ping - I just said that I didn't hear them mention it. But according to my guess, if there are really Chinese agents operating here, it's hard to guarantee that they won't pay attention.

Crane - So you came here tonight to carry out a surprise attack?

Ping - Big brother, you are smart; first, this is a large-scale hotel, with a complex flow of people coming in and out, and they are conducting searches, so this is naturally one of the targets. Also knowing that you live here, how can they be at ease? Of course, they have to protect it" and check it out incidentally. There is also the fact that I heard that they are now trying to find Zhang Zizhong as a condition. According to intelligence, they know that Zhang Zizhong is lurking in the Dongcheng area. They have searched Jiaomin Lane, the Six Nations Hotel, and of course they have to come here to search as well, which is inevitable.

The conversation stopped here.

While I was listening to Tsurumi and Pingzi's conversation, I paid close attention to the expressions of Mr. W and the others. The three of them sometimes whispered to each other, and sometimes signaled with their eyes. Among the three, Mr. Ma spoke the most, and sometimes wrote down a sentence or two in his notebook, indicating that he was very interested in the content of the two people's conversation. Perhaps he couldn't understand Japanese very well, and Tsurumi and Pingzi's tone was so fast and urgent, so he asked Mr. W to translate for him.

Mr. Ma's name is Peiheng, but everyone who is with us calls him Frank. He graduated from the English Literature Department of the University of Hong Kong with the highest honors. His English proficiency, both in speaking and writing, is much higher than that of an average pure-blooded British gentleman. He has a special talent for dialects. Although he was born in Shanghai, his Cantonese, Shandong dialect, and Northeastern accent are not only realistic, but also purer than native speakers.

He has not been gilded or silvered, but he has traveled to Japan and stayed in the Northeast for a period of time. His tall figure, glasses on the bridge of his nose, neat suit, and gentlemanly manner all mark the typical image of a diplomatic talent. Unfortunately, he has been walking on a "grinding mill" path all his life, with ups and downs every three years. He is desperately trying to get into diplomatic circles, but he has never been given a chance, and they are not even willing to let him step halfway through the door.

In disappointment, he had no choice but to read and write; he wrote a little in the domestic English newspapers, and often sent some manuscripts abroad, mostly miscellaneous works. This is where he made a mistake; logically, he should have used the "climbing dragon" method of politicians, specializing in writing political articles with a thick skin; praising, flattering, and scolding; in order to call people's attention to him. If he had done that, he might have been successful early on. But as soon as he climbed onto the typewriter, he only thought about the remuneration. Once the money was in hand, he would go to the bar and drink whiskey soda at one yuan and two jiao a glass, one glass after another, until his pockets were empty.

It was because he stayed in Japan and the Northeast for a few days, and published some questionable papers in Japanese Western newspapers, especially in the days leading up to the Anti-Japanese War, that he attracted the attention of the intelligence network, fearing that he had received a subsidy. At the same time, because he was a useful talent, they were preparing to invite him to cooperate. Before cooperating, they had to test his will, but he vented his ten years of frustration at this wonderful opportunity; so Mr. Dai had to keep him by his side often, in order to give him more psychological training.

This time to Beiping, Mr. Dai came with him on a special mission. Coincidentally, he encountered this tense situation. Looking at his appearance, he seemed very energetic. I suspected that he was collecting writing materials again, preparing to exchange them for whiskey soda.

### Sample Room

— Qi Lou

The Old Testament of the Bible, Genesis, says that God created heaven, earth, and all things. On the seventh day, the work of creation was completed, and God rested on the seventh day from all his work. This is the history written by God.

The devil's history does not say that. It says that God felt tired on the night of the first day of creating heaven and earth.

It says that God felt tired of what he had created. He didn't want to see this annoying heaven and earth anymore. But he was unwilling to destroy it with his own hands. Because he is the creator.

So, the devil's history goes on to say that God wanted to sell the heaven and earth that he had created with his own hands. He turned the universe into a big market, and then turned the earth into a sample room.

This strange history goes on to say that God wanted to make the sample room magnificent, so he arranged high mountains, great rivers, grass, trees, forests, vegetables, and fruits. He also created two great lights, the sun and the moon, in the sky, and countless stars, shining on the earth, making the sample room resplendent and bright.

The terrible devil's history goes on to say that although God arranged everything with great effort, the sample room was always deserted and had no customers.

So, this history says that God suddenly realized that his customer was definitely not another God. Any God can create, so there is no need to come and buy. If God wants to sell the universe, his only customer is the devil. Reading this part of the history, you can hear the devil's hoarse laughter.

All the things that have already been created are not enough to attract the devil. So God created all kinds of animals on land, sea, and air. This was not enough, and then he created mankind. He said to mankind, "Let you arrange this sample room," and then he rested.

Unexpectedly, disputes arose among mankind. Some people worked hard to arrange it, trying to please the devil, while others desperately destroyed these arrangements, not wanting to sell. For tens of millions of years, because of the destruction of the latter group of people, God's transaction with the devil has never been completed. However, the people who arranged it were not discouraged. In the twentieth century, they had greatly arranged it twice. Although they failed, they had already given the devil a desire to buy.

Now there is another treasure in the sample room, which is the atomic bomb that makes the devil salivate. The devil's history ends here with a sentence that fully demonstrates the tone of the customer.

"Let's see their third arrangement."

### "Unemployment Statistics"

— Ji Gan

— The number of unemployed people in this city is three million?

It was published in a certain evening newspaper yesterday, a conversation with the director of a certain employment agency. The headline said: "All industries are in depression, and there are many unemployed people. We appeal to the authorities to help." It also said: "The city has about three million people, which is the most serious social problem at present." At first, I thought it was saying: The number of unemployed people in Shanghai has reached three million, but I didn't believe it. I thought it must be the editor making a sensational claim. But after reading the text, the director of a certain agency really said: "According to the official statistics of this agency, at the end of last year, the unemployed population was only 1.6 million (and) this spring... the number of unemployed people has suddenly increased to three million."

According to the agency's "unofficial statistics," Shanghai has a total population of 4.5 million, so the unemployed account for two-thirds of the total population. Isn't this a shocking number? Upon careful study, I am afraid that not everyone in that 1.5 million has a job. For example, housewives who manage the household, I think they probably won't be counted among the unemployed. Also, the young men and women who are studying in schools are probably not considered unemployed, and the children who are learning to talk and even those who are still nursing in their mothers' arms are probably not part of the unemployed population. Even the seventy or eighty-year-old grandfathers and grandmothers probably won't be included. Because according to the report, "These three million unemployed people are struggling to survive on the verge of starvation every day," I think it probably won't be the turn of those old, weak, women, and children. Since these people are not in the unemployed population, they are of course in the number of 1.5 million employed people. So, the number of people employed in Shanghai is at least cut in half, or even 40% or 30%. Isn't this too shocking?

I don't want to whitewash peace, but if these statistics are really talking about the current situation in Shanghai, I am afraid that everyone won't be able to live like this.

Statistics is inherently a difficult task, because the investigation work is not easy. For example, many unemployed people often like to fill in a job title on certain forms to avoid being regarded as vagrants. Some stall owners and people who do temporary short-term jobs will fill in unemployed. Some people regard idle directors as a job, and those old grandfathers, grandmothers, and young ladies who are not directors, as well as reading babies, are often regarded as unemployed.

Statistics is difficult, and this is true both at home and abroad. During World War I, the United States had a statistic that said that the mortality rate of soldiers on the front line was lower than that of a certain city in the country. The person who made this statistic used it to prove the safety of the front line. In fact, the soldiers on the front line were all strong and robust young men with the greatest resistance, while the domestic cities included the old, weak, women, and children with the least resistance. Especially during wartime, such people are more numerous in percentage terms. Comparing the two in this way naturally leads to such a beautiful conclusion. This situation can just illustrate the "reliability" of the unemployment statistics mentioned above.

### News Outline

— Tie Yun

The bronze statue of the "Goddess of Peace," which had been missing for many years, has been found again. Although the arm is broken, it is worth praying for to restore "peace."

It is said that a third-rate dancer wore a fake diamond ring and had her finger cut off in the tram, with blood dripping all over the car.

This represents a fragment of social tragedy. In fact, "people eating people" is already a common occurrence, so why be moved by cutting off a finger?

Chinese civil aviation seems to have encountered a "gale star." Just after resuming flights, there was another accident. In this way, who would dare to try "flying in the sky" again?

People's tastes are strangely different. Many people like sweets, and many dislike salty food. In fact, it is not bad to have both sweet and salty; don't the daughters of Jiangnan all like salty with a hint of sweetness?

I see that many people go to extremes, and I often think like this.

"Giving" is a kind of pleasure, but when you see a mother and four children (the youngest is lying down and crying, only a few months old) kneeling on the street begging, you feel very unbearable. Regardless of whether she is real or fake, her life is "miserable" and "poor," which is always a fact.

### Unofficial History of the Late Qing Dynasty Officialdom: Two of Lang Cao Duanfang

— Chrysanthemum Lover

Once Duan obtained Changdao, everything went smoothly. He was appointed as a provincial treasurer and eventually a governor, his success achieved quickly, unlike that of regular Han officials. The governor-general relied heavily on Qingrong and secretly communicated with eunuchs, allowing Duan to rapidly rise in rank, making him extremely base and shameless. Those with insight watched with cold eyes, all sneering at him. Duan was also skillful at gaining reputation, like those from Shanghai who are good at showing off. Therefore, he was included in the delegation sent abroad to study political affairs. With his fame established, his ambitions gradually grew. Regarding bronzes, stone inscriptions, calligraphy, and paintings, he previously used tricks to seize them but now relied on his power to plunder them. The three stone inscriptions from Mount Hua were gradually taken from the collections of prominent local families by the three governors-general he served, claiming them as his own treasures, showing his insatiable greed. Fortunately, these three powerful officials were all intimidated by his power and also greedy for lucrative positions, willingly obeying his wishes to fill their own pockets. Why wouldn't they do it? If there were one or two upright individuals, wouldn't it become like Yan Donglou's case with Wang's painting "Along the River During the Qingming Festival," turning into "A Snowstorm"? However, using national treasures as the price of greed and entrusting the governance of the country to such corrupt officials, how could the political system not be ruined? This is truly the fault of those who hold the reins of power. Why blame people like Duanfang?

When he was serving as the governor-general of Hubei, there was a man named Li Wenshi, who could be truly called an expert in appreciation. He could distinguish the authenticity of various antiques such as porcelain, bronze, jade, and stones. He was especially discerning in calligraphy and painting, having a unique eye. He could immediately recognize the famous Southern School painters, and even without seeing the signatures of painters like Ma Yuan and Xia Gui of the Northern School, he could declare, "This is Ma Yuan, this is Xia Gui!" with absolute certainty. Duan highly valued him, inviting him to be a guest advisor in his yamen, providing him with a lucrative position. Duan admired Wenshi, admitting his own inferiority. Duan gathered many treasures in Hubei by taking what he liked and forcefully seizing what he wanted. When he was transferred to be the governor-general of Jiangnan, he became even more arrogant. As a governor-general, he completely emulated Nampi (Zhang Zhidong), spending lavishly. Although he didn't reach the point of having irregular sleeping habits, he truly failed to diligently attend to political affairs. During his tenure in Jiangsu and Jiangxi, he would gather with guests in the Western-style building every evening, discussing nothing but antiques. Diners filled his house, while he put the national economy and the people's livelihood behind him!

### Golden Soup

— Chen Dexin

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, corrupt officials were rampant, leading to the rebellions of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, ultimately causing the downfall of the nation and the people! After the rebel army attacked and entered Beijing, they searched for the hidden treasures of corrupt officials, melting down the silver ingots and forcing the corrupt officials to drink them, which people at the time called "Silver Ingot Soup." Now, officials and merchants collude, hoarding vast amounts of gold, devastating the national economy and the people's livelihood. Perhaps in the future, someone will offer "Golden Soup" to drink, which I imagine will be even tastier than "Silver Ingot Soup."

The national treasury is depleted, forcing us to borrow foreign debts; the wealthy hoard their money, storing it in foreign lands; please remember the ancient saying that the skin depends on the fur for survival, and do not become a sinner for ten thousand years!

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

He hurriedly finished the remaining wine in his glass and immediately asked for food.

"Why are you in such a hurry? Have another two drinks, Lao Zhu!" Fatty Xu was sweating profusely from the drinking, and the alcohol had taken its toll! Judging by the look on his face, he still wanted Lao Zhu to keep him company for a while longer.

"Big Boss, I can't compare to you. I still have things to take care of when I get back!" The guest was already standing up to get food himself, so Lao Xu didn't press him.

"I'll have one more drink and then eat. I..." he declared in a pretense-like manner, like someone who loves to drink, while simultaneously reaching for the bottle of Moutai and shaking it.

Lan and the two children left the dining table, intending to go out. Zhu Zhaonian looked at them anxiously.

"Mr. Zhu," the young woman asked gently, "If I were to visit you, what...? "

"Art Gallery! Art Gallery!" Fatty Xu interrupted without thinking.

"It's on Guixi Road, very close from here. I won't be going out in the afternoon," Zhu Zhaonian said, and then added specifically, "I hope you can definitely come and talk!"

Without saying anything, she just smiled and walked out with the blushing Rong'er.

By the time Zhu Zhaonian finished eating, Fatty Xu had already finished the entire bottle of Moutai, staring blankly out the window with bloodshot, drunken eyes.

Lao Zhu didn't bother to say much to him. He took the towel that A Shi handed him and wiped his face, then strode out.

A Shi loyally turned on the fan on the table for Lao Xu. He heard the sound of Zhu Zhaonian closing the outer glass door behind him, but until his footsteps disappeared, A Shi didn't hear this strange guest singing that line, "5111, 5271," which he always sang every time he came and left.

"Lao Zhu is very preoccupied today... he didn't even sing the 'Starting March'!" Fatty Xu wasn't completely drunk yet, staring out the window, mumbling to himself with a slurred tongue. (20)
