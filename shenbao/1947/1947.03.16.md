### President Chiang's Address

Key points of President Chiang's address at the opening of the Third Plenary Session: (1) The Second Plenary Session convened the National Assembly, fulfilling the resolution to end political tutelage and return power to the people, which is gratifying. (2) Peaceful construction has been frustrated by the deliberate rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party, which is deeply distressing. (3) This plenary session should conduct a detailed review and make clear resolutions regarding the Party's position and responsibilities during the constitutional preparation period. (4) It is hoped that all comrades will recognize the environment, reflect on themselves, conduct thorough reviews, strive for reform, and fulfill the Party's historical mission.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] President Chiang delivered the following speech at the opening ceremony of the Third Plenary Session today:

Comrades: Today, our Party is holding the Sixth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session, exactly one year since the closing of the Second Plenary Session. Comrades have gathered in the capital to review past achievements, exchange work experiences, analyze the current situation, and establish the direction of our Party's future efforts. This will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the advancement of our revolutionary nation-building tasks. It is especially gratifying to reunite with many comrades after a year apart.

Task of Returning Power to the People Accomplished

The greatest task left to us by the Second Plenary Session was to convene the National Assembly, promulgate the Constitution, and implement constitutional government, in order to fulfill our long-cherished wish of ending political tutelage and returning power to the people. This task, after numerous twists and turns, was finally accomplished satisfactorily thanks to the united efforts of various domestic parties and social leaders, as well as the sincere cooperation of our Party comrades. Since the promulgation of the Constitution at the end of last year, the government has been proceeding with the advancement of constitutional preparation procedures in accordance with the resolutions of the National Assembly. At the same time, in accordance with the consensus reached at the Political Consultative Conference, we are expanding the foundation of our National Government. As of now, the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan have already been joined by people from various parties, and the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will also be reorganized and completed in the shortest possible time. Such concerted efforts will surely be able to implement Sun Yat-sen’s teachings and complete the nation-building process, to comfort the revolutionary martyrs and the military and civilians who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance over the past fifty years. This is the first thing I want to report to the Assembly.

Regarding the progress of peaceful construction, it is most heartbreaking to talk about. The declaration of the Second Plenary Session pointed out that the nationalization of the military is the foundation of peaceful unification. Only when the country has a unification that matches its name in reality can democracy be truly realized and economic construction be carried out. Therefore, it was confirmed that there should no longer be armed rebellions in our country, and there should no longer be disorderly phenomena in various localities. The declaration of the Second Plenary Session also pointed out that stabilizing order and alleviating the people's suffering are urgent needs, and restoring transportation, especially reviving the economy, must be the top priorities. Therefore, the declaration of the Second Plenary Session resolutely demanded that the Communist troops stop continuing their attacks and obstruction of unification actions. The National Government's handling of domestic political disputes is based on this principle. The government deeply understands the suffering of the people across the country after surviving the disaster, as well as the devastation of the society after the war, and is unwilling to subject them to further damage. Therefore, for the military actions of the Communist Party's armed separatism that hinder unification and harm the people, it has repeatedly exercised restraint in order to resolve them through political methods and mediation. In the past year, the government has issued three cease-fire orders and conducted countless negotiations under the mediation of friendly country America, but the Communist Party has always blindly believed in force and broken faith. The government, in accordance with the troop reduction plan, implemented troop reductions, while the Communist Party continued to expand its troops. Every time the government issued a cease-fire order, the Communist troops took the opportunity to continue expanding their occupation. Finally, they refused to participate in the National Assembly and denied the Constitution passed by the National Assembly. They also flatly rejected the government's proposal to send representatives to negotiate peace.

Communist Rebellion Makes Construction Difficult

The developments of the past three months have proved that the path of political resolution is already hopeless, and the Communist Party's full-scale rebellion and military actions obstructing unification have expanded day by day. In the Northeast, they have twice attacked Changchun, and in Shandong, they have continuously attacked Qingdao and Jinan. In recent days, they have launched fierce offensives in western Shanxi and northern Shaanxi. With such a rebellious situation expanding day by day, the people across the country demand stability, but the Communist Party refuses to allow a moment of peace. The people across the country call for peace, but the Communist Party insists on expanding turmoil. The government, in order to defend national unification and ensure the safety of the people, naturally cannot sit idly by and fail to stop the turmoil. However, the country's vitality has been exhausted and ravaged, and the reconstruction work has been greatly hindered. The people have suffered immense hardship, and the progress of economic construction is even more difficult. This is truly the greatest misfortune for the country!

I want to make it clear to our comrades that the course of the Chinese national revolution over the past fifty years has been full of difficulties, but every difficulty has added another trial and increased another ray of light. From the Northern Warlords to the Japanese imperialists to today's Communist Party, they are all obstacles encountered during our nation's recovery and difficulties that we must overcome. As long as we follow the aspirations of the people across the country, follow the proper path of saving the country and building the nation, and gather patriotic people from across the country to fight together, there is nothing we cannot succeed in. Therefore, our most important and urgent task today is still to do our best. We must consolidate national unification, destroy obstacles that hinder national construction, and at the same time, we will never change our policy of implementing democracy and construction, or slacken our efforts to implement constitutional government and revive the economy. What our country demands today is national unification and political democracy. Our greatest task after the victory of the War of Resistance is the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. As long as we fight steadfastly and work tirelessly, we dare to say that no force can prevent the completion of our nation-building work.

Should Work Together with All Parties

The themes we will discuss at this plenary session are certainly numerous. The proposals submitted by the Standing Committee include those on constitutional government, general politics, economics, and party affairs. I personally believe that this plenary session should pay special attention to a detailed review and make clear resolutions regarding the Party's position and responsibilities during the constitutional preparation period. We are facing the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, with only nine months until the implementation of the Constitution. This plenary session is truly a plenary session to end political tutelage. Since the completion of the Northern Expedition, because the country has been plagued by many disasters, we have had to take on the important task of the country with the spirit of not shirking responsibility for the past twenty years, but we have never neglected our preparations for implementing constitutional government. During the War of Resistance, we invited various parties and social leaders to participate in the work of resisting Japan and building the nation together. The establishment of the Political Participation Council has laid the foundation for democratic politics. Now that the Constitution has been promulgated, we will enter the constitutional period in the process of nation-building. In terms of the political situation, we will transition from a period in which one party is responsible to a period in which all parties are jointly responsible for the people. In the future, the responsibility of the country will be made public to all parties and the entire people. Therefore, this plenary session is truly an unprecedentedly important gathering in twenty years. We must start from this plenary session, redefine the relationship between the Party and the government, and change the awareness and concepts of our Party members during the period of political tutelage. In the past, the Party's policies were implemented by the Party through the government. In the future, all our decisions regarding national military, political, and economic matters will be sent to the government in the form of suggestions, and we will assist the government in implementing them. Before the next National Assembly convenes, although we cannot completely relinquish our responsibility for the country, we must immediately prepare to consider ourselves an ordinary political party, to be on an equal footing with other parties, to fulfill the same obligations, to enjoy the same rights, and to encourage each other with other political parties to promote the success of national construction. This is a meaning that no previous plenary session has had. I want to especially remind all comrades to carefully study and make resolutions, so that all levels of party branches and all comrades have a consistent path to follow.

Review Ourselves and Strive for Improvement

Secondly, at this plenary session, we should spend most of our time and energy focusing on reviewing our own Party. Our Party has a long history and a solid foundation, but in these twenty years, how should our qualities be improved, how should the work style of the party branches be improved, how should the relationship between the Party and the people and the Party's spirit of serving the people be reviewed and improved, how should the history of the Party be promoted, and how should the education of party members and the atmosphere of self-criticism be effectively promoted? Because we are the largest party in the country, and because we are the party that has been responsible for the country for the longest time, there is undoubtedly no lack of shortcomings and inertia in our Party. How should we correct these shortcomings and eliminate these inertia? Especially in today's situation where the country is plagued by disasters and the revolutionary environment is dangerous, how should we strengthen our self-confidence and mutual trust? In the eve of the implementation of constitutional government, how should we cultivate the magnanimous attitude of our party members to get along sincerely with other parties? All these kinds of problems require comrades from the entire session to humbly and calmly study, gather ideas, and make resolutions. We must know that our Party exists for saving the country and building the nation. Only by improving our Party can we enrich our Party. Only by enriching our Party can our Party shoulder its responsibility to the country.

Comrades, our President Chiang often said: "Within the country, if one thing is not in its place, it means that our revolutionary responsibility has not been fulfilled." This is truly a very precious instruction. Now it has been two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, but reconstruction has not been completed, construction is hindered, the people's livelihood is difficult, society is precarious, the economy is unstable, and people's minds are scattered. The independence and equality of our country have not yet been truly guaranteed. These are all the shame of all our party comrades, and it is also the responsibility we should bear to our compatriots across the country, to the revolutionary martyrs, and to the military and civilians who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance. I hope that all comrades will recognize the environment, reflect on themselves, take advantage of this session to conduct thorough reviews, and strive for reform, so that we can encourage all party comrades to be loving, sincere, responsible, and devoted to their duties, be worthy of being Sun Yat-sen’s followers, and fulfill the historical mission of maintaining the glory of the War of Resistance and promoting the success of nation-building.

### Personnel with Best Performance to Be Summoned Periodically by the Chairman

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] In order to encourage outstanding civil servants in their duties, Chairman Chiang has specially instructed that the personnel with the best performance in the central Party (League), government, and military agencies of this city in the 35th year of the Republic of China be summoned on the 24th after the National Government Memorial Week.

### Korean Communist Troops Land in Dalian; Over 4,000 Rapidly Advance to the Shili River Frontline; Strange Planes Strafe Pulandian Again

[Our Newspaper, Qianyang, 15th] Military News: At 10:00 AM on the 9th, over 4,000 Korean Communist troops, fully equipped with Russian-style weapons, arrived from northern Korea and landed in Dalian, and have rapidly advanced to the Shili River frontline. Furthermore, the Communist army plans to conscript 150,000 soldiers in the Liaodong Peninsula, which has already begun.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] Military News: At 1:00 PM on the 12th, a twin-engine bomber of unknown nationality suddenly flew over Songmutiao to an area 10 kilometers west of Pulandian near Bijia Mountain and strafed at low altitude for a quarter of an hour.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] The weather in Pulandian is turning warmer, and the surrounding sea and Dasha River are about to thaw. There is water on the ice, and ice under the water, making passage dangerous, which is greatly disadvantageous to the Communist army.

### Communist Troops Fiercely Attack Along Niuwu Town; Fierce Battles in Fuxian County, Northern Shaanxi; Offensives Launched Against the Southern Section of the Tongpu Railway

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 15th] East of Yonghe, western Shanxi, a large number of Communist troops crossed the river westward on the 13th and have increased their attacks south of Yanchang. The battle situation in the eastern and northeastern areas of Fuxian County today is fierce. Communist troops are fiercely attacking the National Army along Niuwu Town. The National Army is firmly defending and is still in fierce battle.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 15th] Chen Geng of the Taiyue Military Region of the Communist Army convened a military conference in Anze to support the Yan'an decision, resolving to launch an offensive on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, with its troops attacking Yicheng, Jiangxian, Fushan, Jishi, and Huoxian. The troops of the Lvliang Military Region are responsible for attacking Daning and Puxian. The troops of the Taiyue Military Sub-district Commander Yuan Yong and the 456th police regiment are responsible for attacking Quwo, Houma, and Linfen.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 14th] Liang Huazhi's Opinion: If the Communist army loses in Hebei, Shandong, and Shaanxi, they will all retreat to Shanxi, and Shanxi will inevitably become the decisive battleground between the Nationalists and the Communists. Currently, the families of senior Communist cadres have moved from Yan'an to southeastern Shanxi, which shows that the Communist army will not defend northern Shaanxi to the death.

### In the Bag-Shaped Area Between Nong'an and Dehui, the National Army Begins a General Counter-Offensive; The Left Wing of the Jinpu Railway Advances to the Suburbs of Taian

[Our Newspaper, Changzhe, 15th] In the bag-shaped area between Nong'an and Dehui and north of Changchun, the National Army began a general counter-offensive at noon today, aiming to encircle and annihilate the Communist army in this bag-shaped area. Significant results are expected tonight. Furthermore, Sun Liren, commander of the New First Army, arrived in Changchun from Dehui today.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 15th] It is reported that internal friction occurred within the Northeast Communist Army. While Lin Biao led his troops to fiercely attack Dehui and Nong'an, Zhou Baozhong's troops remained stationed in the Xiushuidianzi area. Furthermore, the Communist troops in Taolaizhao, Xishisanjia, encountered another Communist force, resulting in a misunderstanding and a fierce battle lasting four hours, with significant casualties.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 15th] The defending troops of Nong'an launched separate attacks on the 15th, and the Communist troops fled north in droves. Our advancing troops from Changchun arrived at Liangyimen south of Nong'an at 12:00 noon today, and established contact with the Nong'an army on the Baijiagangzi line, encircling over 10,000 Communist troops between Liangyimen and Nong'an.

[Our Newspaper, Xinpu, 14th] Tang Enbo flew to Haizhou on the 13th to inspect defenses and left Haizhou at 2:00 PM.

### Tidbits from the Plenary Session

Song Falls off the List

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] When the Presidium was elected at the preparatory meeting of the plenary session, the Chairman first nominated double the number of candidates from the list of executive committee members. Among the 22 candidates nominated, Song Ziwen was also one of them. As a result of the voting, Song received a total of nine votes, ranking 22nd, making him the last person to be eliminated from the list of candidates. Song is still enjoying the spring scenery in Hangzhou and will not attend the meeting in Nanjing. During the voting, there were a total of 183 voters, with Sun Ke receiving the most votes, followed by Yu Youren, and Chen Guofu third. Li Wenfan ranked 12th, being the first to be eliminated. In addition, Cheng Qian, Pan Gongzhan, Zhang Daofan, Duan Xipeng, Liang Hancao, He Zhonghan, Masiwude, Zhang Lisheng, and Zhu Jiquing were also on the list of candidates for the Presidium.

Reporters Unable to Enter the Venue

During this plenary session, regarding news reporting, it was decided that the Central News Agency would broadcast nationwide. Today, when the general meeting was held, there were only a few reporters in the gallery. This is in stark contrast to the unprecedentedly lively situation during the National Assembly held in the same venue (National Assembly Hall) last winter, when more than a hundred reporters crowded into the gallery. The plenary session adopted a policy of not welcoming reporters from various newspapers to enter the venue for interviews, which will also be the first phenomenon of its kind in previous plenary sessions. Today, reporters from various newspapers can only be active outside the venue, using their talents and efforts to inquire, but the gains are minimal. The general meeting has a news release group, which is managed by personnel from the Central Propaganda Department and distributes news in the morning and afternoon, so the place is quite deserted. Party newspapers such as the Central Daily News (a public bulletin) have also requested to send reporters to enter the venue, but have now abandoned this plan.

Central Committee Members Dare Not Travel by Plane

At the opening ceremony of the general meeting this morning, a total of 253 Central Committee members attended, including 136 executive members, 47 alternate executive committee members, 50 central supervisory committee members, and 20 alternate supervisory committee members, which is less than the number of attendees at the previous sessions. There are a total of 460 Central Committee members, and fewer attended this time. One reason is the transportation barriers in various places, and the third is that, in view of the recent plane crashes, many timid and elderly Central Committee members dare not risk their lives on a plane. In addition, another reason is that some Central Committee members who are soldiers must sit in command as the Communist army is launching a spring offensive, so they cannot get away. When the preparatory meeting was held this morning, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng announced that "those absent Central Executive Committee members will be replaced in accordance with Article 35 of the Rules of Procedure of the Chairman, and the 46 alternate executive committee members who attend the meeting can be replaced in order, and have temporary voting rights in the meeting."

Opening Ceremony at the Mausoleum

The opening ceremony of this Third Plenary Session was held at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, after the mausoleum visit, and the preparatory meeting at 9:30 was held at the National Assembly Hall, where the National Assembly was held last winter. There were 2,058 seats in the hall, which was still not enough during the National Assembly. But this time there were only 253 attendees, so the venue was very empty. In addition, the equipment and layout inside and outside the venue are far less than during the National Assembly, so it presents a different scene. It was decided that the number of reporters from various local newspapers who were sent to Nanjing to report on the National Assembly reached more than 350, and the number of reporters entering the venue also reached more than 100. This time, there were very few people coming to Nanjing, and the Central News Agency's reporters attending the plenary session were also less than ten people. The cost of the general meeting was 30 million yuan, and there were nearly 300 staff members, who were drawn from the original personnel of various agencies such as the Central Party Headquarters, and each person received a subsidy of 10,000 yuan per day.

### Jinghai Area Defense Zone Assigned to Shangguan's Command

Cavalry Division Entering Hebei Transferred North Back to Chahar

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 15th] The tense situation in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway has not eased. Yesterday, 5,000 Communist troops and militia also infiltrated southwest of Jinghai. The Baoding Pacification Headquarters has decided to assign this section to the command of Shangguan Yunxiang, director of the Tianjin Command Post. Shangguan, Chen Jicheng, Song Kentang, and others had a meeting yesterday to adjust the defense zone. It is also reported that the recent frequent movements of the Communist army in Hebei are due to the mutual transfer of 20,000 troops from Liu Bocheng's unit and He Long's unit. Liu's unit entered the Taihang Mountains for reorganization and replenishment of new recruits.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 15th] The Communist army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has recently become active again. Over 10,000 Communist troops from Wan, Tang, and Wang in western Hebei have detoured north. It is reported that the Communist army gathered between Mancheng in the north and Zijing Pass in Yixian has reached 30,000. The Communist army outside Baoding is also moving frequently. The National Army was completely still yesterday, and the war situation is unpredictable. In addition, the cavalry divisions that entered Hebei have all been transferred north back to Chahar.

### Statement from Our Embassy in the Soviet Union: Refusal to Participate in Informal Meeting; Molotov Has Abandoned Original Suggestion

[Report from This Newspaper] Moscow, 15th Broadcast: Following the formal refusal of the Chinese Embassy to participate in the three-power informal meeting, both Marshall and Bevin have reconsidered Molotov's suggestion regarding discussing the Chinese situation. Marshall and Bevin believe that the Chinese issue should not be discussed first. On the other hand, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is prepared to no longer insist on discussing the Chinese situation.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] Our embassy in the Soviet Union has issued a statement saying: "Because Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent letters to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin, suggesting convening an informal meeting of the three foreign ministers, with Chinese representatives participating, so that the three countries could provide information for the implementation of the 1945 Moscow Conference Communiqué concerning China, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, through the Chinese Embassy in Moscow, has today expressed to Marshall and Bevin that the Chinese government cannot participate in or agree to this meeting." It is reported that before issuing the above statement, Ambassador Fu Bingchang visited Marshall and Bevin this morning, discussing matters with them for one hour and twenty minutes each.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall inquired whether China would accept Molotov's suggestion to attend a foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the report on the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Declaration on China. Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Fu Bingchang, has already delivered Foreign Minister Wang's written reply to General Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 15th and requested them to forward it to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The content of the reply is as follows: The 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Declaration on China was not attended by the Chinese government, and because that declaration was aimed at China's internal affairs, it was deeply opposed by the Chinese people. The Chinese people's eight years of resistance war was originally aimed at striving for freedom and independence. That declaration inevitably harms their sense of independence and autonomy. Therefore, the Chinese government cannot participate in or agree to the foreign ministers' meeting proposed by the Soviet Foreign Minister with the aim of discussing the 1945 Declaration on China. China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States are countries fighting side by side, and it is absolutely necessary to mutually respect their status and the self-esteem of their people. We solemnly request the foreign ministers of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain to cease any discussion involving China's internal affairs.

[Central News Agency, London, 15th Dispatch] According to the London Times correspondent in Moscow: British Foreign Secretary Bevin has telegraphed the British government, requesting instructions on how to respond to Molotov's suggestion to start informal meetings early to discuss the Chinese issue. He stated that before leaving London, Bevin assured the governments of the various autonomous territories that he would not participate in any discussions regarding Far Eastern issues while in Moscow.

[United Press, Cincinnati, Ohio, 15th Dispatch] Gu Ziren, the director-general of the World Student Federation, declared here today that the Soviet Union's attempt to drag the China issue into the Moscow meeting is merely to inform the Chinese Communist Party that the Soviet Union is still backing them. The Soviet Union has provided assistance to the CCP. The Soviet Union should have withdrawn from Dalian and Harbin on December 3, 1945, but has still not left to this day.

### Public Sentiment Boils Over in Opposition to Interference in Internal Affairs

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Voices opposing the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference discussing the Chinese issue have spread throughout the country. A summary report is as follows:

Nanjing: The China Lixing Society sent a telegram calling on compatriots across the country to rise up and resolutely oppose international interference in our internal affairs.

Hangzhou: The Hangzhou Journalists Association today issued a declaration expressing indignation at the Soviet Union's suggestion to interfere in Chinese political affairs at the Moscow Conference, and deeply hopes that compatriots across the country will be of one heart and one mind to strengthen peaceful unification. In addition, the Hangzhou Municipal Council, representing 450,000 citizens, also telegraphed the whole country, expressing the same sentiment.

Tianjin: The Tianjin Provisional Municipal Council sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang on the 14th, opposing the Moscow Conference discussing issues related to our country.

Jinan: The Jinan Municipal People's Freedom Protection Committee, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and seven other people's organizations telegraphed the Chairman of the National Government and Foreign Minister Wang, supporting the government's solemn statement regarding the foreign ministers' meeting.

Hankou: The All-Circles Rights Protection Conference passed a telegram to Chairman Chiang, opposing international interference in our internal affairs. The conference is scheduled to hold a rights protection rally and parade on the 17th.

Shenyang: [This Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th Dispatch] After the restoration of the Northeast, the first large-scale student patriotic movement was launched. Starting at 10:00 AM on the 15th, 30,000 university and middle school students from six universities and twenty-nine middle schools held a large parade, shouting "Oppose international interference" and "The Northeast cannot be lost again." "People of the Northeast can no longer be slaves of a fallen nation." The patriotic sentiment of the citizens of Shenyang has also risen as a result.

### Yang Liangong Telegraphed the Control Yuan: Order Gradually Returning to All Parts of Taiwan; Ge Jingen to Visit the Chairman Today to Report

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Supervising Commissioner Yang Liangong of Fujian and Taiwan telegraphed the Control Yuan on the 14th, reporting that: after broadcasting and informing of the Chairman's and the central government's benevolent intentions, order is gradually returning to Taitung, Tainan, Taichung, and other places. The situations at the Kaohsiung and Chiayi airfields have been pacified. Yang is currently going to visit National Taiwan University. The school has not started, but there is no damage.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Ge Jingen, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Provincial Government, after arriving in Nanjing, is scheduled to pay a visit to the Chairman on the 16th to report on the truth of the February 28th Incident and make some requests. Regarding the current politics of Taiwan, he will also have concrete discussions with Minister Bai. After decisions are made in Nanjing, he will fly back to Taipei with Minister Bai, and Chen Yi will remain in Taiwan to await the central government's handling methods.

Ge's Remarks

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Ge Jingen, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, flew to Nanjing by special plane at noon on the 14th, welcoming Minister Bai to Taiwan. When reporters visited him to inquire about the current situation in Taiwan, Ge made the following remarks: "On the 28th of last month, riots broke out in Taipei. The reason for this incident was that the lackeys left over from the Japanese rule era, and the Taiwanese ruffians repatriated from overseas, incited by traitors, took advantage of the Monopoly Bureau's opportunity to investigate and suppress illegal cigarettes, and instigated the exclusion of mainlanders, creating terrorist incidents and disrupting public order. After careful handling by the government, transportation such as railways and highways is now smooth, and order is gradually restored. All counties and cities in the province have resumed normal operations. As for the central government sending troops to Taiwan, it was originally to protect good people from being held hostage by a few rioters. Now the people have understood the government's measures, and some of those who joined in echoing them are deeply remorseful, and some have come to apologize. In the future, if Taiwan is not subject to external provocation, it will be able to quickly return to normal. Regarding the issue of provincial government reform, the Taiwan Provincial Government has long had the intention of reorganizing the government. Once approved by the central government, it can be implemented. The implementation of popular elections for county and city mayors is also being prepared early and can be implemented ahead of schedule before the implementation of the constitution. The reports that "the Taiwan delegation to Shanghai lost their freedom of movement after arriving in Taiwan" and that "more than 200 Taiwanese industry leaders are still imprisoned, and more than 20 students have been detained" are not true. When the Shanghai delegation to Taiwan arrived, it was already evening, and martial law was in effect. For safety reasons, they were advised not to go out, but their freedom was not restricted. Moreover, Minister Bai, as a representative, lived in the same hotel and should have been protected. The Taipei Garrison Headquarters has indeed captured a small number of rioters in recent days. These people participated in the looting of military warehouses and attacks on military and government agencies on the 8th and 9th of this month. After interrogation, those with minor circumstances have been gradually released."

### Representatives of Six Taiwanese Organizations in Beijing and Shanghai Host a Reception for Journalists and Issue a Statement in Shanghai

[Report from This Newspaper] The Taiwan 228 Massacre慰問团, organized by representatives of six Taiwanese organizations in Beijing and Shanghai, including Zhang Weixian, Li Weiguang, and Chen Chongguang, took a special plane from the Ministry of National Defense to Taiwan on the 11th, but due to the dire situation, returned to Beijing the next morning. The團 hosted a reception for the local press at the青年会 at 2:00 PM yesterday. Li Weiguang reported on the motivation for organizing the團 to visit Taiwan and its itinerary [see page of this newspaper on the 14th], and issued a written statement, which stated in brief:

Cause of the Incident

The 228 Incident was entirely due to the Taiwanese people's dissatisfaction with Taiwan's special administrative governor, the monopoly, the trade control system, and the rampant corruption of Taiwanese officials, which made it impossible for the people to live and forced the incident to occur. He pointed out that the seizure of 1.8 million Taiwanese dollars and 54 private seals from the home of a certain section chief of the Civil Affairs Department of Hsinchu County, Taiwan, was enough to show the corruption of Taiwanese officials.

Ringleaders

He further analyzed the ringleaders who participated in the incident as being extremely complex. (1) More than 40,000 Taiwanese people who were conscripted by the Japanese during the war to fight in various places in the South Seas and Hainan Island. After the war, they became the backbone, including a part of the senators and students, who had political demands. (3) The rogues and underground personnel who were previously under the command of the Japanese in Taiwan took the opportunity to move around, alienating the feelings of the Taiwanese and mainland compatriots, and cruelly killed and injured mainland compatriots. These were all done by them. Most Taiwanese people have absolutely no psychology of excluding mainland compatriots. Chen Yi has always adopted a protective attitude towards these rogues and underground personnel. (4) Chen Yi falsely reported to the central government that the riot was instigated by communist elements, which was actually an excuse for his past. Even if we dare not断Taiwan has absolutely no communist activities, even if there are very few, they are not enough to launch such a large-scale incident.

Source of Weapons

As for the source of weapons for this incident, it is said that the Japanese buried part of the weapons in the deep mountains or scattered them among the people when they surrendered the year before. The Governor's Office repeatedly received confidential reports, but Chen Yi ignored them. After the Taiwanese people in Beijing and Shanghai confirmed the matter to the Ministry of National Defense, Chen才once hired workers to excavate in the mountains. However, the workers eventually stopped working because they were not paid and had no life security. This became the original source of weapons for the riot.

Two Requirements

The团末提出要求Chairman promised to immediately abolish the governor system,专制system, and trade control system within the scope allowed by the constitution, and to clearly order Chen Yi to be dismissed and severely punished. (2) The government's Taiwan善后should avoid the use of force, and guarantee that it will no longer pursue the people who participated in the Taiwan Incident, and call on local fair people to persuade all industries to resume operations and stabilize order.

### Fictitious Military Agency Case Cracked Outside Beiyingmen, Tianjin; More Than 20 Main "Officers" Arrested

[This Newspaper, Tianjin] The Tianjin Municipal Police and Garrison authorities cracked down on a fictitious military agency on the 11th, calling itself the "Second Division Headquarters of the Coastal Defense Army." The "Adjutant General," "Chief of Staff," and "Brigade Commander of the Fourth Brigade" of the "Second Division of the Coastal Defense Army," as well as more than twenty others, were arrested on the spot. "Division Commander Zhao Dengming," who claimed to be the younger brother of the late famous general Zhao Dengyu, escaped. The details of the case are as follows:

Li Duowei, the manager of the Shengli Freight Yard at No. 3 Lujia Hutong, Beiyingmenwai Avenue, Tianjin, previously met Zhao Dengming, who claimed to be the "Division Commander of the Second Division of the Coastal Defense Army." Zhao bragged to Li and appointed him as the "Director of Military Supplies." Li was trapped and gave his freight yard to Zhao Dengming to serve as the "Headquarters" of the "Second Coastal Defense Army." After establishing the "Headquarters," Zhao Dengming further launched a large-scale operation, manufacturing military uniforms, symbols, appointment letters, and so on. He appointed "brigade commanders," "regiment commanders," "battalion commanders," "chiefs of staff," "adjutants," and so on, and sent people to Jinghai, Cangxian, and other places to recruit new soldiers.

The Tianjin security authorities previously arrested several "officers" wearing "Second Coastal Defense Army" symbols in the city, and they were all arrested during the cracking of cases of fraud, injury, theft, etc. Because they did not know to which this "unit" belonged, they requested instructions from the Beiping Pacification Headquarters. After receiving a reply, they learned that it was an illegal organization. They went to Beiyingmen, surrounded and searched the "Headquarters," and arrested more than 20 people, including "Brigade Commander of the Fourth Brigade" Zhu Jingqi, "Major Adjutant" Zhao Yongmao, "Chief of Staff" Cui Tongshan, "Director of Military Supplies" Li Duowei, and others. In addition, seven people, including "Adjutant General" Ding Ziyan, were escorted from Jinghai County. On the spot, they also seized forged official seals, symbols, appointment letters, and other items, as well as two large guns, several small guns, and more than 30 large knives, which were the "equipment" of the "division." The handling of this case is currently being requested by the Garrison Headquarters from the Beiping Pacification Headquarters.

Editorial

### Absolutely Not Participating in Discussions of Chinese Issues Outside of the Conference

Our government, on the 14th, solemnly declared to the four nations of Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, through diplomatic channels, that China would not send representatives to participate in discussions of Chinese issues, whether within or outside the conference. This diplomatic measure is truly the most wise decision made by our diplomatic authorities and should be supported unanimously by the people of the entire nation.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov attempted to instigate the joint intervention of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in China's internal affairs. Therefore, on the first day of the Moscow Conference's opening, he proposed including the Chinese issue on the agenda. Unexpectedly, Molotov's rash actions stirred up a great international uproar. Not only did the 450 million Chinese people, who felt insulted, erupt in angry protests, but also people of conscience in other countries expressed their disapproval. Such an absurd proposal could not possibly be agreed to by British Foreign Secretary Bevin and U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall. In the second meeting, Molotov himself deeply realized the irrationality of his proposal and had to change course, abandoning his original proposal and adopting Foreign Secretary Bevin's compromise solution, agreeing that the Chinese issue would be discussed informally outside the conference by the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Secretary of State Marshall insisted on his consistent position that no discussion of the Chinese issue should take place without the participation of Chinese representatives, which Molotov also accepted. Although Molotov's attitude inevitably lacked the demeanor of a diplomat due to his about-face, in his heart, he was still pleased with himself, believing that as long as the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union discussed the Chinese issue in Moscow, whether within or outside the conference, or in any other way, it would not be difficult to achieve his goal of instigating the three nations to jointly interfere in China's internal affairs. Therefore, we must persist in opposing international interference and firmly oppose the discussion of Chinese issues, whether within or outside the conference, or in any other way, in order to shatter Molotov's delusional dream of instigating international interference.

On the opening day of the Moscow Conference, we expressed our opinion, hoping that the four powers would not include the Chinese issue on the agenda, and stated that whether the four powers could respect the public will of our people would be a major test of the foreign ministers' conference. Later, upon hearing Molotov's proposal, we could not help but loudly protest against international interference and protest Molotov's insulting attitude. Now, we still maintain this basic stance and express our opposition to discussing the Chinese issue outside the conference. We have always cherished the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and will never act emotionally. Although we have suffered intolerable insults from Molotov, our rationality can still restrain the overflow of feelings. Therefore, our opposition to discussing the Chinese issue outside the conference is not based on subjective emotional impulses but stems from our calm reason. Our reasons are explained in detail below:

First, the Soviet Union's request for the three foreign ministers to discuss the Chinese issue, whether within or outside the conference or in any other way, harbors a conspiracy to instigate international interference in China's internal affairs, which not only violates the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance but also undermines the Charter of the United Nations. Molotov must know that China is not a defeated nation but a victorious nation with undeniable achievements. The Soviet Union not only recognizes China as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and one of the five member states of the postwar foreign ministers' conference but also has a treaty of friendship and alliance with China. How can the Soviet Union bring up the internal affairs of a friendly nation that is on equal footing with it for discussion? And how can it instigate other nations to jointly interfere? Therefore, we cannot help but doubt whether Molotov has the Charter of the United Nations, the Potsdam Agreement, or the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in mind. International relations are based on trust and integrity. If a nation like the Soviet Union has no trust and integrity to speak of, how can we expect it to be among the ranks of powerful nations and lead all nations to jointly create world peace?

Second, the people of all nations in the world yearn for the world after World War II to enter an era of peace and democracy as soon as possible, so that humanity will no longer have to suffer the threat of war. But how can this ideal be realized? Everyone agrees that the ominous names of "power politics" and "secret diplomacy," which contributed to war, should no longer be seen in the postwar world of peace and democracy. But in reality, the situation is quite different. The Yalta Conference of February 1945 secretly made decisions regarding the Chinese issue, and the Moscow Conference of December 1945 issued a declaration concerning our nation without our participation. All of this has caused deep pain and resentment among our people. In the future, we will never want to see the re-enactment of "secret diplomacy" in international politics, nor will we want to see the revival of "power politics." Otherwise, world peace and collective security are all deceptive terms, and humanity will never have the hope of living freely and peacefully together.

Third, although China's internal problems are extremely serious, we believe that we will surely find a way to solve them ourselves. The Chinese people are a nation of utmost greatness and strength, who have endured internal strife and foreign aggression and will ultimately be able to overcome any difficulties. The great powers can rest assured that China's internal problems, as long as they do not have an international background that makes them more complicated, will not endanger international peace. Therefore, Molotov's excuse that "the situation in China has not improved" to justify discussing the Chinese issue is simply unreasonable. As for our request for the United States to mediate the problems between the Nationalists and the Communists, it was made voluntarily. Therefore, when General Marshall came to China to mediate for peace, the people of the entire nation expressed a warm welcome. When he announced his abandonment of mediation, we did not insist on it either. It cannot be considered that the United States was interfering in China's internal affairs. Now, before the opening of the Moscow Conference, our diplomatic authorities had already declared that the Chinese issue should not be included on the agenda. The foreign ministers of Great Britain, France, and the United States unanimously expressed their agreement, and even the Soviet government did not express any dissent, which can be considered tacit approval. However, after the conference opened, Molotov insisted on raising the Chinese issue for discussion. After being rejected, he still requested to discuss it outside the conference. Molotov's intentions are obvious. Now that China has expressed its firm opposition and decided not to send representatives to participate, if the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union still disregard the will of the Chinese people and brazenly discuss it, this would be an unforgivable interference in China's internal affairs! It absolutely cannot be confused with the United States' mediation!

From the above, our opposition to international interference and our refusal to allow Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to discuss the Chinese issue, whether within or outside the conference, are justified and confident. Apart from Molotov, who has ulterior motives, all people of conscience express sympathy for our protest. In particular, Secretary of State Marshall and Foreign Secretary Bevin will not be deceived by Molotov. The fact that the British and American foreign ministers have been slow to respond to Molotov's letters, and the future is becoming bleak, is excellent proof. Moreover, the Chinese government has already notified the four nations through diplomatic channels, stating that China will not send representatives to participate in discussions of Chinese issues, whether within or outside the conference. If the foreign ministers of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union do hold informal discussions on the Chinese issue, no matter what decisions they make, our country will not be bound by them. Therefore, the result will not affect our country, but will only reveal Molotov's futile efforts.

### Promoting the Democratization of German Politics; Marshall Suggests Five Points; Four Foreign Ministers Announce German Prisoner of War Figures

[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] Secretary of State Marshall today presented to the Foreign Ministers' Conference a statement on promoting democracy in Germany, proposing that the Berlin Conference instruct the Allied Control Council to prepare for the revival of Germany's democratic political life and for Germany's peaceful cooperation in international life. This directive should be more specific to ensure that the process of promoting German democracy is unified in all four zones. Only in Germany do the Allies have the opportunity to demonstrate to the world the sincerity of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations regarding democratic goals. The lack of agreement on the protection of political and economic freedoms in the various zones of Germany prevents the Germans from jointly preparing for the reconstruction of democracy. Restrictions imposed after the war must now be lifted. Merely eliminating Nazi forces is not enough to democratize Germany; positive action must be taken to restore the German people's democratic political and economic life. In his statement, Marshall also pointed out that democracy is often interpreted in various ways. The United States government and the American people believe that mankind possesses certain inalienable basic rights, including the freedom for each individual to develop their thoughts freely, without infringing on the rights of others, and without intimidation or coercion. A society in which people who respect the rights of others are not free to express their beliefs cannot be considered democratic. If law-abiding citizens live in fear of being deprived of their lives, property, or the right to work happily, that society is not free.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 14th] The five basic plans proposed by Secretary Marshall are as follows: (1) Unanimously guarantee all basic civil rights that the German people should enjoy; (2) Guarantee the right of political parties to participate in free and fair elections; (3) Guarantee free trade; (4) Guarantee the freedom of newspapers and radio stations throughout Germany; (5) Guarantee the freedom of movement of people and goods throughout Germany.

Secretary Marshall then submitted a report stating that there are currently 30,976 German prisoners of war in the American-occupied zone, and they are scheduled to be dealt with in June. He said that the meaning of democracy varies from person to person, but the U.S. government has a basic definition for it: human rights cannot be transferred or taken away. With regard to the freedom of newspapers and radio stations, it is inextricably linked to democracy and freedom. He concluded by saying that there were originally 117 arsenals in the American-occupied zone, and 80 of them have already been dismantled, and the remainder will be destroyed this year.

At this point, Molotov expressed his opinion, saying that he could not agree with Secretary Marshall on the fourth point and would respond later.

British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced that the United Kingdom still holds 435,295 German prisoners of war, with 17,500 being sent to the UK each month to work, but starting on July 1, 20,000 people will be sent back to their home country each month. French Foreign Minister Bidault said that France currently holds 631,483 people, of whom 500,000 are working in France.

The foreign ministers of the four countries have scheduled a meeting tomorrow to discuss the exchange and movement of people and the division of territory. In addition, the issue of compensation will also be raised for discussion, but Molotov requested more time to calculate the exact amount. It is reported that the amount of German compensation requested by the Soviet Union is 10 billion US dollars.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 15th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov reported to the other three foreign ministers this morning that the Soviet Union currently holds 890,532 German prisoners of war, but he did not specify how many prisoners of war are currently in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.

[Associated Press, New York, 15th] Regarding the number of German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union, TASS Moscow broadcast on the 15th provided an answer, stating that since the end of the war, a total of 1,003,974 German prisoners of war have been repatriated, and 890,532 remain in Soviet territory.

### One Week Since Opening, Foreign Ministers' Conference Achieves Nothing; Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meetings Also Deadlocked

[This newspaper's report] Moscow, 15th broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has been in session for a week and has made no progress. Currently, there are three major problems: (1) After China refused to participate in discussions outside the conference, it is extremely difficult for the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to take another new step; (2) How to deal with the hundreds of thousands of refugees still in concentration camps in Germany; (3) How to reorganize the internal affairs of Germany. After the four deputy foreign ministers met today, a deadlock formed. The Soviet representative's request to allow Albania to participate in the negotiations for the German peace treaty was rejected by the United States and Britain, resulting in a postponement of the meeting, with negotiations to resume next week.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 15th] In an atmosphere of such turbulence, the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, which has achieved nothing, held its last meeting of the week at 4:00 p.m. to discuss the disposal of the millions of displaced people in German refugee camps and the division of German borders. The four foreign ministers met as usual at 11:00 a.m., but due to the disappearance of the peaceful atmosphere in Moscow, there was no hope of success. If the deputy foreign ministers cannot break the deadlock, the dispute over the German-Austrian peace treaty will only be submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. One of the main differences in the deputy foreign ministers' meetings is that Britain, the United States, and France agree that Austria can have an army of 55,000 men, while the Soviet Union wants to limit it to 50,000, so that it does not exceed the military strength of its Balkan countries. The Soviet Union also proposed that Austrian military weapons be limited to those manufactured domestically and that they be prohibited from purchasing them from foreign countries, but Britain and the United States believe that this would hinder Austrian sovereignty.

[Associated Press, New York, 15th] Moscow broadcast: The deputy foreign ministers' meetings have been stalled due to the British and American refusal to include Albania in the discussions of the German peace treaty. The Soviet Union requested that Albania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia participate in the conference on the German peace treaty at the same time, but Britain and the United States believe that these countries helped the Axis powers during the war, especially because they continued to invade after Germany, and therefore do not allow them to do so. The Moscow broadcast stated that no agreement was reached on this matter in the deputy foreign ministers' meetings, so it was postponed to next Monday for discussion. Which countries should participate in the discussion of the basic issues of the German peace treaty remains undetermined. If the deadlock cannot be broken next week, the dispute can only be reported to the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

In his speech, McNarney emphasized that the displaced people are waiting to be dealt with by the military government. Clay replied that the U.S. military should continue to work hard to achieve peace and security. McNarney has now been transferred to serve as the chief representative of the United States to the United Nations Military Committee.

### MacArthur Issues Latest Occupation Report, Analyzes Strategies of Japanese Communist Party

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 15th] In addition to praising the achievements of democratization, MacArthur's latest occupation report also pointed out that the Japanese Communist Party has recently been working hard to organize a united anti-government front. The report analyzes the Communist Party's strategies, stating: "The Communist Party attacks the government's economic policies in the Diet and announces that it will implement 'democratic' legislative procedures in accordance with the Constitution. Outside the Diet, it attempts to promote anti-government activities through labor unions and farmers' organizations, and seeks coordination with the Social Democratic Party at any time."

The report also stated that in various local institutions, the Communist Party decided to abandon its own candidates and support "democratic" candidates nominated by various labor unions and people's organizations. In the Diet, the Communist Party supports the Social Democratic Party's cabinet. The Communist Party continues to seek the support of small and medium-sized merchants and farmers for a united front against the Yoshida cabinet.

Regarding the issue of public order, the report stated that strikes and demonstrations in December have decreased, but there are still some acts of sabotage.

Four Important Bills of the Current Diet

The report also mentioned that Japan is making great progress towards becoming a truly democratic country. In the 91st emergency Diet from November 26 to December 25, a motion to dissolve the Yoshida cabinet was rejected by a vote of 236 to 160. The four important bills passed by the current Diet are: (1) Election of a House of Councillors to replace the House of Peers; (2) The future cabinet must be responsible to the Diet; (3) Restriction of the powers of the Imperial Household Ministry; (4) Imperial property will belong to the state.

### Far Eastern Commission Decides to Restrict Japanese Consumable Goods

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The Far Eastern Commission announced today a decision to restrict Japanese consumable goods, such as machinery, cotton, ceramics, and electrical materials, in order to increase exports to supply countries that have been invaded by Japan in the past. Unless MacArthur issues other instructions, the amount of cotton consumed should be limited to 2.5 pounds per person per year, with workers allowed to increase slightly, but the total amount must not exceed 50 million pounds.

### Soviet Union Agrees to Japan's Temporary Compensation Plan, But Does Not Allow Deduction of Materials Removed from Northeast China

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The Far Eastern Commission stated that the Soviet Union has agreed to the U.S. plan to authorize MacArthur to distribute 30% of the temporary compensation determined by Japanese industry to countries in urgent need. However, the Soviet Union requested that when it distributes its share, the industrial equipment that the Soviet Union removed from Northeast China should not be deducted.

### British Aid to Greece; Fierce Debate in the House of Commons; Final Decision to Continue Lending 19 Million Pounds

[Reuters, London, 14th] The House of Commons today passed a loan of 19 million pounds to aid Greece, of which 18 million pounds will be used to subsidize Greek military expenses, and 1 million pounds will be used to purchase civilian goods to donate to Greece. During the debate, Deputy Foreign Secretary McNeil said that the British government greatly supported the United Nations' Greek investigation and proposed a permanent or semi-permanent presence there. The British government will support this proposal. He also said that the Greek government, whether it is left-leaning or right-leaning, must have an army to maintain order. Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Eden mentioned the political situation in Greece during the debate. He said that it is very difficult to establish a coalition cabinet in Greece, and that Bulgaria, which was an enemy country during the war, still has an army, so the Allied country of Greece should of course have an army. He also pointed out that the leaders of the Bulgarian government are not worth maintaining friendship with any country. He argued that the British government should assist Greece economically by purchasing surplus Greek tobacco, which would be more effective than the proposal being debated today.

[United Press, London, 14th] Three members of the House of Commons Labour Party announced today that they will ask the government on the 16th to explain Britain's connection to President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey. Government officials said that Britain will discuss Truman's statement at a regular meeting on the 17th.

### Turkish Chief of Staff to Visit the United States at Invitation

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] The "Washington Star" Ankara correspondent Brown said that Turkish Chief of Staff General Omurtag will soon visit the United States at the invitation to discuss the implementation of President Truman's plan to aid Turkey. Officials at the Turkish Embassy here told our agency that they were unaware of this matter. Brown said that after receiving the invitation, General Omurtag will depart for the United States with several experts familiar with the U.S. military's general staff policies.

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 14th] Renowned economist Onar said today that the Turkish government will use the future U.S. loan to complete a new industrial plan.

### Hard Times for Salaried Class; It's Not Easy for the President to Accumulate Wealth

[French New Area Agency, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 15th] President Truman's income tax bill proves that it is not easy for a head of state to accumulate wealth. The President's annual salary last year was $75,000, and after paying income tax and the White House's food expenses, only $4,200 remained.

### Truman's Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan Receives Congressional Support; Foreign Relief Bill to Be Given Priority

[United Press, Washington, 14th] President Truman's request for aid to Greece and Turkey has gained congressional support, with the only opposition focusing on minor restrictions to the terms. Republican Senator Aiken declared that in this critical moment, Congress seems to have no other option than to act in unison with the President. Democratic leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Connally, anticipates that the President's proposal will be passed by a majority in both houses. A Republican leader suggested that the only way Congress could change the President's commitment to aid Greece and Turkey would be to withhold the funds, but Moscow might interpret this as weakness. Therefore, Congress has virtually no alternative but to align with the President. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, presented a confidential report to his Republican colleagues today. Upon leaving the meeting, he indicated that there were many questions requiring answers from the government, involving various aspects of financial and military aid, as well as potential repercussions.

[Associated Press, Washington, 14th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee, after consulting with Republican Party and government officials for three hours today, agreed to publicly hear opinions early next week on Truman's proposal to provide a $400 million loan to aid Greece and Turkey in resisting Communism. It is expected that while the government believes it is imperative to quickly assist Greece and Turkey to prevent a loss of balance in the Eastern Mediterranean, the President's $350 million foreign relief bill will be given priority for discussion.

[United Press, Washington, 15th] Congressional members speculated today that after the U.S. implements its anti-communist policy, in addition to the $400 million loan to Greece and Turkey approved by President Truman and Congress, at least five other countries, including Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Hungary, and Palestine, may also need to borrow from the United States.

Greece Welcomes American Aid

[Associated Press, Athens, 14th] Today, local shops closed for two hours to hold a parade, expressing gratitude for America's plan to aid Greece. Prime Minister Maximos telegraphed the Turkish government through the Turkish Ambassador, declaring that Greece and Turkey now stand on the same line of democracy. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tsaldaris met with the South African Ambassador for discussions, fueling rumors that South Africa and Canada are also deeply concerned about Greece's recovery. Communist leader Zachariadis published an article in "Rizospastis," denouncing the U.S. move as interference in Greece's internal affairs, possessing imperialistic ambitions, and that Truman's speech has endangered the mission of the United Nations and will incite more bloodshed.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 5th Broadcast: The White House recently released a statement by President Truman, noting that the U.S. President's proposal to support Greece has not only been endorsed by the Greek government, but also by the opposition party within the Greek cabinet, which has also expressed its cooperation.

### Mountbatten Scheduled to Take Office; Nehru Inspects Punjab Province

[Reuters, London, 14th] The newly appointed Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, along with his wife and daughter, is scheduled to leave London for India by special plane on March 20. His staff will depart a day earlier, and both planes are expected to arrive in Delhi on the 22nd.

[Reuters, Lahore, 14th] Unrest continues in the northwestern region of Punjab Province. Officials state that the situation there is extremely serious, with frequent incidents of murder and arson. Approximately 2,500 rioters in the Jhelum district, despite suppression by the military, continue to set a village on fire. Near Campbellpur, along the banks of the Indus River, military police engaged rioters across the river for two hours. The situation is tense in the Sikh holy city of Amritsar.

### Paraguayan Rebels Gain Momentum; Control Entire Northern Territory and Cut Off Railroad; International Reactions Possible

[Agence France-Presse, Buenos Aires, 15th] It is learned here that the entire northern territory of Paraguay, except for Chaco City, has fallen into the hands of the rebels. However, during the seven days of civil war, government troops have not engaged in major battles. Observers commented that Colonel Garcete, the police chief of Chaco City, maintains a neutral stance, so the key to the situation now rests with that location. There is only one regiment of troops in the city, which has joined the rebels. On Wednesday night, the rebels attempted to capture the city of Pinnacos, leading to a battle, but they were repelled by dawn the next morning. Currently, the lack of major battles is mainly due to transportation difficulties on both sides. The capital of Paraguay is sixty miles away from Concepcion City, the rebel headquarters, connected only by the Paraguay River. The railway line has been cut off by the rebels, and continuous heavy rain and rapid currents make navigation difficult, making it hard for government troops to launch a punitive expedition there.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] Diplomatic sources here stated that the internal conflict in Paraguay is temporarily an internal matter, but it may soon trigger international reactions. On the 6th of this month, unrest broke out in various parts of the country, starting in the capital, but was quickly suppressed. It is rumored that the Minister of the Interior has formally condemned former President Colonel Franco as the instigator of this conspiracy, which was instigated by the Communist Party. The rebels declared that they have no partisan affiliations and only want to replace the current government with a democratic regime. Diplomatic sources continued that in July of last year, President Morinigo managed to preserve his power with the cooperation of the Progressive Party following the unrest. The current situation is reminiscent of that time, and the United States and Argentina are now closely monitoring the situation. The government of Argentine President Peron may fully support Morinigo, but the United States is different and must determine whether the cause of the rebellion is to establish a democratic government or a power struggle between political parties before it can decide its attitude.

### Rebellion Also Breaks Out in Ecuador; Suppressed by Government Forces

[Agence France-Presse, Bogota, 15th] An Ecuadoran radio station announced this morning that the military rebellion that previously occurred in the Riva Mandala area was small in scope and has now been suppressed.

### U.S. Navy Secretary's Speech Calls for Strengthening National Defense; Empty Talk of Disarmament Cannot Solve Problems

[Our Report] San Francisco, 15th Broadcast: U.S. Navy Secretary Forrestal stated in a speech to the Foreign Policy Association that if the United States continues to reduce its military strength, "we will lose the ability to defend ourselves or others." Forrestal did not directly comment on the plan to provide economic and military assistance to Greece and Turkey, but stated that it is doubtful whether the United States can fulfill its obligations to the United Nations. World peace depends on the attitude and strength of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom, and mere disarmament cannot solve the problem. The Soviet Union is unwilling to establish a United Nations international force early to maintain world peace. Since the victory over Japan, the United States has destroyed the largest military organization in history. We are willing to lead the world in disarmament, but we cannot abandon national defense until we have obtained collective security.

### Soviet Parliamentary Delegation Urges British-Soviet Cooperation

[United Press, London, 14th] The twenty-member delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, invited to Britain by the British Parliament, was led by Kuznyetsov.

### Hong Kong Administrative Structure to Change Soon

Plans Look Good on Paper, but Substance is Doubtful

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 15th] The administrative structures of Hong Kong and other British colonies will soon undergo fundamental changes to give local people greater autonomy. The plan for changes to the Hong Kong administrative structure has been approved by the Colonial Office in London, stipulating the establishment of a municipal council with "broad representation" to gradually assume the powers of the current Hong Kong government. At the same time, the number of official personnel in the Legislative Council will be gradually reduced, so that non-official or non-government personnel can constitute a majority. Some quarters have frankly expressed doubts about this proposal, believing it to be merely "sugar-coating" for the establishment of the Income Tax Bureau. The plan looks very good on paper, but its substance depends on how the municipal council is elected and how much power it can acquire. At least two of these aspects have not yet been disclosed to the public. They also point out that half of the non-official members of the Legislative Council still need to be appointed by the Governor. "Unless more is revealed about this plan, we cannot have a complete review."

### Counterfeit French Currency and US Dollar Operation Cracked Opposite Caohejing Huangjia Garden; Large Quantities of Counterfeit Currency, Copper Plates, Printing Machines, Etc. Confiscated; Main Suspects, a Soviet Couple, Arrested Simultaneously

The Second Investigation Brigade of the Songhu Garrison Command's Investigation Office cracked an international counterfeit French currency and US dollar operation yesterday morning. The main suspects, Soviet citizens Luo Gaoqing Kaofu and Qinni Nuosi Diba La (Luo Gaoqing Kaofu's wife), as well as three Chinese, including Yang Yufen, were arrested on the spot. A quantity of finished counterfeit ten-dollar US banknotes, Central Bank of China 1945 issue one-thousand-yuan counterfeit notes, as well as a large number of copper plates, machines, instruments, chemical raw materials, etc., were confiscated. The counterfeit US dollars and French currency were identified by experts from the US military headquarters intelligence group and experts from the Central Bank, and it was temporarily impossible to recognize that they were counterfeit banknotes, demonstrating the exquisite quality of the printing.

It is reported that Liang Zhiping, the brigade commander of the Second Investigation Brigade, and Zhang Wenming, the brigade adjutant, received a confidential report a month ago that there was a counterfeit US dollar and French currency operation near Caohejing in this city, run by a Soviet citizen. Brigade Commander Liang then reported the situation to Director Tao Yi, and dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate.

Confirmed Address and Monitored for a Week

After more than a month of investigation, on the evening of the 7th of this month, it was confirmed that the operator of the counterfeit banknote operation was Soviet citizen Luo Gaoqing Kaofu, and that the operation was located at the home of Zhang Ziwen, the Bao Chief, at No. 1 Guo Lu Bao opposite the Huangjia Garden in Caohejing. Upon receiving the report, Brigade Commander Liang continued to send officers to the area for re-investigation. When the investigators arrived at No. 1 Guo Lu Bao, a foreign person was carrying four bundles of neatly wrapped canvas packages and jumped into a prepared car, driving away quickly. Fearing that they would alert the snake, the investigators did not reveal themselves at the time and sent people to follow, but the car drove too fast and got away. This clue having been lost, they continued to monitor the counterfeit banknote operation at No. 1 Guo Lu Bao. This continued for a week.

Morning Arrests: Both Suspects and Evidence Obtained

At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Brigade Commander Liang led Adjutant Zhang and more than twenty investigators to Zhang Ziwen's house. Upon entering, Luo Gaoqing Kaofu and his wife, Qinni Nuosi Diba La, were studying the color separation of the Central Bank of China two-thousand-yuan notes, planning to counterfeit them. When they saw the investigators rushing into the room, they knew that their crime had been discovered, but their attitude remained exceptionally calm. They were also exceptionally quick-witted, and while talking to the investigators, they tried to escape. Fortunately, the precautions were tight, and they were not able to escape. Subsequently, counterfeit banknotes, twenty-one copper plates, a large number of chemical raw materials and counterfeit banknote printing machines, a large number of printing chemical books, and other equipment were confiscated in the room. The local Baojia Chief was also summoned to inventory everything.

Monthly Rent for Operation: One Million

Brigade Commander Liang then escorted the suspects back to the brigade headquarters and personally searched the suspect's residence at No. 2324 Feier Road, but found nothing. After interrogating the suspect severely, he confessed that the counterfeit banknote operation at No. 1 Guo Lu Bao was introduced by Yang Yufen, a Chinese beekeeper living at No. 2 Caohejing, with a monthly rent of one million French currency. Regarding the other details, he did not divulge the truth. Based on the confession, Liang sent officers to arrest Yang Yufen at the address. As for the landlord, Zhang Ziwen, he had already fled upon hearing the news.

Four Imprisonments in Shanghai

The main suspect, Luo Gaoqing Kaofu, has been in Shanghai for more than twenty years and is a well-known chemist. In 1928, he was arrested for counterfeiting Dutch and Soviet passports and banknotes and was imprisoned four times, with the longest imprisonment lasting one year and six months, and the shortest lasting three months. The case of the Soviet citizen Erhuade counterfeiting US dollars, which was cracked by the Garrison Command last year, was actually a henchman of the suspect. The confiscated counterfeit French currency and US dollars are exquisitely printed. The serial number on the US banknotes is B09979758D, and the serial number of the counterfeit French currency of the Central Bank of China 1945 issue one-thousand-yuan note begins with the letters AG. As for when the suspect started counterfeiting French currency and US dollars, and the exact amount of counterfeit banknotes that have been issued, it is still impossible to know because the suspect is exceptionally cunning and refuses to tell the truth. The investigation is ongoing.

The counterfeit US dollars and French currency confiscated are shown in the upper right corner. The main suspect is of Soviet nationality (China News Agency Photo).

### Two Suspected Traitor Cases Concluded; Sentences to be Announced on the 22nd

[Our Report] Cao Songhai, who was a pseudo-police officer, was accused of pouring water into and beating Huan Buyin, the pseudo-Public Works Bureau foreman, during the enemy occupation, causing him to die of cerebral hemorrhage. The case was initially tried by the pseudo-local court. After the victory, the local procuratorate transferred the case to the Special Criminal Tribunal of the High Court because the defendant had held a pseudo-official position. After several hearings by the High Court, the defense was heard yesterday morning. Cao still firmly denied the pouring of water and beating, and blamed it on Zhao Yinting, another fugitive defendant and pseudo-deputy detective. After a long trial, it was announced that the case was concluded, and the sentence will be announced on the morning of the 22nd.

Chen Mugen, originally a carpenter, was accused of recruiting workers for the enemy in 1943 to transport them to Sijiao Mountain in the Ningbo sea area to build fortifications. In the spring of 1945, American planes bombed the mountain, and some of the workers were killed. After the victory, the surviving workers sued Chen at the High Procuratorate, accusing him of being a traitor. The case was also concluded with defense yesterday, and the sentence will be announced on the morning of the 22nd.

Wang Xingjian, who was accused of being a radio technician at the No. 76 Pseudo-Special Agent Headquarters, was questioned in the High Court yesterday, and the hearing was rescheduled. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Embezzlement by Secretary of Import-Export Association Discovered; Dismissed

[Our Report] The commercial registration of members of the Import-Export Merchants Association is handled by the Association on their behalf. Recently, the Bureau of Social Affairs received a report that the Association was charging each registered member a handling fee of 40,000 French currency. After investigation, it was confirmed that this was the intention of Zhou Jing, the secretary of the Association, and was not approved by the directors and supervisors. It was found that there was embezzlement in the process. The Bureau has now ordered the Association to dismiss Zhou and recover the funds that have been collected. At the same time, it has issued a notice to all trade associations that they must not charge any fees when handling commercial registration for members.

### Taiwan Provincial Representatives Call for Three Relief Measures

Chen Bisheng and Zhang Weixian, representatives of six Taiwan provincial groups in Shanghai, accompanied Director He of the Ministry of National Defense to Taiwan for the "February 28" incident. They have now returned to Shanghai from Nanjing. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they hosted reporters at the Youth Association to report on their trip and the current situation in Taiwan, and issued three calls. (1) The authorities are requested to immediately implement the abolition of the Governor-General's Office and the monopoly system, and the promise to change Taiwan into a provincial government. (2) Remove Chen Yi from office. (3) Avoid the use of force against the leaders of the February 28 incident, release innocent arrested people, and guarantee that they will not be prosecuted.

### Cleanliness Inspection Completed; Pu Yuan First in the School Group

The new round of cleanliness competition in the city, Group A (District Inspection Team), Group B (School Group), has ended. In Group A, the results of the inspection showed that the 17th District was the best, and the 3rd, 4th, and 8th Districts were relatively inferior. In the school section of Group B, Pu Yuan Middle School was first, and Xinlu Normal School was the worst. In the primary school section, the primary schools such as Xiaoxue Yuele were quite clean, but some primary schools either due to negligence or due to environmental constraints, the results did not reach the standard. The work of Group C (Organization Group) is in progress and will be completed by the 20th. After the review meeting for the above three groups, the winning silver cups will be awarded. It is also heard that this inspection was conducted in a blitz style, without prior notice, so the judged results are relatively accurate.

### Cheng Rongfang Case Sentenced; Prosecution Not Accepted; Defendant Allowed to Be Released on Cash Bail

[Our Report] In the case of an American sailor stabbing a rickshaw puller, the defendant, Rogers, was sentenced by Judge Lv Shaochang of the local court yesterday morning, and the prosecution was not accepted, and the plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The defendant was allowed to be released on a cash bail of 10 million French currency. The reasons for the judgment stated that for crimes that are prosecuted upon complaint, if the complaint has been withdrawn, a judgment of non-acceptance should be made. When the prosecutor filed the case, because the victim's condition was a difficult-to-treat injury, it was considered a serious injury and prosecuted under Section 2 of Article 277 of the Criminal Law (non-prosecution crime upon complaint). However, since the victim's injury has now healed, the prosecutor also stated in court that the legal provisions of the prosecution have been changed. Since it is not a serious injury, this case falls under Article 277, Section 1, and Article 287 of the Criminal Law, which are prosecuted upon complaint. Then, whether the prosecution should be managed depends on whether the victim has withdrawn the complaint. The victim's withdrawal of the criminal complaint has been filed on January 29, and it has been confirmed that the victim, Cheng Rongfang, signed the statement, was not coerced, and was mentally clear, so it is a valid legal act. Judge Wu also stated that for the civil lawsuit part, a private prosecution can be filed in the Civil Court.

### Leniency for Traitors, Opening a Way Out, Judicial Yuan Issues Instructions, May Apply for Parole

Therefore, all traitor crimes that meet the provisions of Article 77 of the Criminal Code may apply for parole."

Absconding with Funds

Lu Zixiang asks: There are two legal questions, please answer them: (1) My cousin found out that her fiancé has a venereal disease after the engagement. Can she request to dissolve the engagement and pursue compensation from the man? (2) A certain B absconded with 5 million yuan of legal tender from the merchant shop he serves. The shop owner pursued compensation from his recommender, a certain A. But A is also unable to repay. I wonder if it is possible to negotiate compensation with B's family. Can B's family's farmland be seized to offset the debt? Also, because there was no evidence when B absconded, can the merchant shop testify?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin Answers] (1) If your cousin's fiancé has a serious incurable disease, or has venereal disease, or other serious illness, the woman can dissolve the engagement according to Article 976, Paragraph 1, Item 4 or Item 5 of the Civil Code. According to this provision, when the engagement is dissolved, the non-negligent party may request the negligent party to compensate for the damages suffered as a result, according to Article 977 of the Civil Code.

According to a certain educator who spoke to reporters: There are many points that urgently need improvement in the current curricula of various universities, such as: (1) The amount of coursework is too heavy, with first-year students' coursework, including experiments, reaching as many as 38 hours; (2) The subjects are complicated; (3) The content and order of the subjects are not properly arranged; (4) In science, theory and experiment should be coordinated; (5) General courses should be adapted to the school's equipment and the current environment; (6) The issue of using textbooks and lecture notes. This is only a part of the common problems currently occurring in various colleges and universities, and there are many more problems that cannot be described in detail. The significance of establishing this association lies in studying the above-mentioned problems to make them more rational. When the association holds its inaugural meeting, it can be divided into groups for research. The specific plans for future work will also be decided at the first meeting.

The joint university committee of Soochow, St. John's, and Hangchow universities in this city, after many discussions, will formally merge into one at the beginning of the autumn semester this year, and the name will be "East China United University."

The number of directors will be nine foreign founders, nine original directors from Hangchow, Soochow, and St. John's universities, and five social elites, totaling 23 directors, which exceeds the regulation of 15 people, so it is still requesting the Ministry to review and approve.

In terms of funding for the joint university, in addition to the US$3.5 million donated by the United States, 30% of the 10 billion fundraising campaign for church universities will be allocated to the joint university. The joint university will have six colleges: Arts, Science, Law, Engineering, Commerce, and Medicine.

### Textile and Construction Company and Private Cotton Mills Request Adjustment of Cotton Yarn Price Limit, Mutual Sales Within 3.65 Million Yuan

[News from This Newspaper] The China Textile and Construction Company held a board meeting yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs personally attended and presided over the meeting. Wang Yangxian, Ouyang Lun, Yang Xiren, Shu Zizhang, Li Shengbo, Wu Weijing, Wang Hui and others attended. The agenda was as follows: (1) Report on the company's production situation in the past year and the recent production and sales situation. (2) The company has a total of 200,000 yarn spindles in Jinzhou, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Andong and other places. Currently, 100,000 spindles have been put into operation. The important personnel of each factory will be assigned by the board of directors separately. (3) The company's policy of being handed over to private companies has been determined in principle. However, whether to adopt the method of issuing stocks or bidding will be decided by the planning committee of state-owned enterprises being handed over to private companies. (4) The company strives to start purchasing domestic cotton to supply raw materials. Up to now, it has purchased about 1 million dan, and hopes to purchase another 300,000 to 400,000 dan. In addition, it is still necessary to supplement about 350,000 dan of foreign cotton.

In addition, it was reported that the Textile and Construction Company and various private cotton mills have recently requested the Textile Control Committee to increase the price limit due to the rising cost of cotton and the fact that the yarn price has not been adjusted. It has recently been decided by the Textile Control Committee that the yarn price will be based on 20 counts as the standard. The price of the Textile and Construction Company was originally 2.5 million yuan, and it is proposed to increase it to 3.25 million yuan. Private cotton mills can mutually sell within 3.65 million yuan. This price has now been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and it will be promulgated and implemented after approval.

[Another Report] The price negotiation group meeting of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association was held at the Textile and Construction Company around 11:00 AM yesterday. After discussion, a preliminary decision has been made on the purchase price of cotton yarn in March. It is reported that the highest price of 20-count standard yarn has been set at 3.0 million yuan. This price negotiation will be submitted to Chairman Wu for deliberation by Wang Zijian. In addition, it was decided that the factory price for private factories to trade freely will be calculated based on the cost price plus legal profits. The highest price of 20-count standard yarn has been set at 3.99 million yuan. The above prices will be submitted to the Textile Control Committee's extraordinary meeting tomorrow for discussion and approval, and then handed over to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Beijing for final approval.

### Sixth District Cotton Textile Association Re-Appeals: Rescind the Ban on Shipping Yarn and Cloth South

The ban on shipping yarn and cloth south has been repeatedly appealed by the six district textile associations to the Textile Control Commission, but the Commission believes that the market price of cotton yarn has not stabilized, and rescinding the ban would inevitably stimulate prices, so the request has not yet been approved. Now, the six district associations argue that the price of cotton yarn purchased is no longer sufficient to cover costs, and sales of yarn from various mills are being hindered, making it even more difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, they have restated their reasons and requested the Textile Control Commission to lift the ban. It is said that the Textile Control Commission has turned to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for instructions. The reasons for requesting the lifting of the ban are recorded below: It is found that the previously promulgated ban on the southward transport of cotton yarn and cloth was based on government measures at that time, originally intended as a temporary expedient measure due to unstable price fluctuations, and not a permanent national policy. In September of last year, this association reported the difficulties of various yarn mills and the urgent need for yarn and cloth in South China, requesting the revocation of the ban. Subsequently, in November of the same year, it was decided in consultation to purchase half of the cotton yarn produced by private yarn mills. The attending members also exchanged opinions verbally, agreeing that when the purchase of cotton yarn was implemented, the ban on southward transport would be lifted at the same time. Now that the purchasing work has been realized, and the inventory in various ports near Shanghai is sufficient, it is enough to supply the market. At present, sales in the Shanghai market are sluggish, and the market price of cotton yarn is also stabilizing. However, according to the current prices, they are not sufficient to cover costs, and the sales of various factories are blocked, resulting in a sharp reduction in income, while current expenses are difficult to reduce in the short term. Faced with the difficulty of this imbalance of income and expenditure, they will inevitably suffer suffocation and sit and wait for death. There is an urgent need for yarn and cloth in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places. The government should originally take into account the people's livelihood, make overall plans, and should not bear to see the people of the South without clothes to cover their bodies, and especially should not bear to see private yarn mills cut off from survival. Therefore, the cancellation of this ban should not be hesitated any longer, lest it be too late to save the situation. A special request is made to maintain the original resolution and immediately revoke the ban in order to maintain the industry.

### Yarn Mills Purchasing National Cotton, Waiting Quietly for Four-Bank Loans

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Council of Shanghai previously proposed that yarn mills should purchase as much Pudong "Fire Machine" cotton as possible to promote the economy of cotton farmers. The Textile Control Commission has consulted several times, in addition to sending a letter to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to promptly supervise the improvement of cotton seeds, and also ordered the Textile Construction Company and the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association to instruct various factories to use national cotton as much as possible when spinning coarse-count yarn. If funds are needed for the purchase, the proposed purchase quantity can be reported to the association, so that it can negotiate mortgage loans with the Four-Bank Joint Office on behalf of the mills. Currently, the companies planning to purchase cotton are: China Textile Construction Company planning to purchase 20,000 to 30,000 dan, Weichang 200 dan, Hengchang 1,000 dan, Hengda 3,000 dan, Hengtong 6,000 dan, Daxin 1,200 dan, Huaxin 1,000 dan, Hailin 3,000 dan, Qin Yi 1,000 dan, and Shenxin's planned purchase quantity has not yet been determined. It is said that the above-mentioned factories can start purchasing after the loan has been approved.

### Fine Yarn Scarce and Prices Rise

Yesterday, the yarn market remained stable. Buyers from Tianjin continued to trade actively, so the 20-count yarn, especially "Hong Kui" and "Tian Nu" brands, were particularly popular. Other counts also rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Due to the extreme scarcity of fine yarn, 32-count yarn rose by about 100,000 yuan, and 40-count and above also rose by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan.

### Thorough Investigation of Replication Industry, Allotted Yarn Flows into Black Market

The Shanghai Association of Manufacturers of Replicated Cotton Fabrics stated that members are not allowed to transfer or trade cotton yarn purchased from the Textile Construction Company in the market. However, such incidents have recently occurred, which may affect the reputation of the industry. It is reported that in addition to notifying all members to strictly discipline themselves, the association has also sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. If any members are found to have illegal activities, they will be reported to the authorities at any time.

[Another report] The Economic Group of the Garrison Headquarters recently discovered a case of off-market trading of yarn and cloth, in which Zhongnan Cotton Weaving Factory sold to Yonglong Cloth Factory, and was handled by a person named Wang, involving a considerable amount. The Yarn Industry Association has reported proof of this to the Economic Group, and the Economic Group will investigate.

### Cotton Cloth Sales to Out-of-Town Customers Still Strong

Yesterday, the market for cotton cloth continued to see strong sales to out-of-town customers. Plain cloth... buyers from Tianjin and other places still made sporadic purchases, and the market remained firm. Among fine cloths, medium-grade goods were still being bought by local shops and factories, so their prices were relatively firm. For example, 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose more sharply than the previous day, with the price being 156,500 yuan. Later, as the Textile Construction Company opened sales of greige cloth as usual, with the listed price of 20-count fine cloth being 2,000 yuan lower than the previous day, people's minds gradually softened. The sales of other twill cloths and Shilin cloths, Anan blue cloths, etc. were sluggish, and price fluctuations were mixed.

### Strong Selling Sentiment for Rayon

Yesterday, there was a strong sentiment in the market to sell rayon short, and prices continued to fall. 120-count "Takayama" glossy rayon for Monday delivery was quoted at 6.3 million yuan, but there were few buyers, down another 100,000 yuan from the previous day. Other semi-glossy rayons also saw price reductions of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, due to the continuous declines in glossy rayon. The market situation for factory direct sales remained quiet, with prices generally weak. Ordinary small lots were traded between 6.8 million and 6.9 million yuan, while large lots were sluggish. Comforter covers were not being made, and "Dacheng" checkered crepe was listed at 16,700 yuan, with transactions at 6,500 yuan, but the volume was very small. "Huajin" crepe fell by 200 yuan, and silk-feather yarn saw some sales, with prices stabilizing.

### Central Bank Official Talks About Not Speculating on Financial Policies

[Central News Agency, this city] Rumors circulating in the market that the exchange rate will be lowered are unfounded. According to a responsible person from the Central Bank, the Bank's financial policy prioritizes stability. In the past, there has been much speculation about economic and financial measures in the market, which has caused market unrest. It is hoped that people in the society will not speculate on the government's financial measures before there is a clear order to change them, so as not to shake people's confidence and give speculators an opportunity.

### National Bonds Rise

Government bonds rebounded yesterday. Credit was loose and abundant, and there was still strong buying interest from outside the industry. Short sellers also covered their positions, leading to a slight increase. "Tong Bing" bonds opened at 9,000 yuan, bottomed at 8,300 yuan, and then gradually climbed to 10,500 yuan, before hovering at the close. "Jia Yi" bonds closed at 5,500 yuan and "Ding" bonds at 6,200 yuan, while "Tong Wu" bonds closed at 6,700 yuan, all at high prices. As a result, "Jia Yi" bonds rose by 400 yuan, "Tong Bing" bonds rose by 1,200 yuan, and "Ding Wu" bonds rose by 500 yuan, with a total turnover of over 10 million yuan.

### Foreign Shares Stable

Yesterday, foreign shares saw minimal fluctuations. Ewo Cotton opened at 18,600 yuan, with a high of no more than 18,800 yuan and a low of 18,400 yuan. The price stabilized at the end of the day. As a result, the gains and losses of various shares were minimal compared to the previous close. Rubber shares also stabilized.

### Rice Shops Become More Active

Yesterday, a total of about 8,200 shi of rice arrived from both the north and south. The weather turned cloudy, and the price of rice produced in the interior was still high, so rice shops became more active. Japonica rice rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan in the northern market, and by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan in the southern market. Rice bran also rose by 2,000 yuan.

### Tobacco Leaf Sales Sluggish, Prices Fall

### Approved Merchants' Petition Group Complains to the Press Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Approved Merchants' Petition Group, consisting of Ankang, Heping, Yu Kang, and Tai Feng four banks, and Hong Kang (Xing Ji), Hong Chang, Hong Tai, Heng Jiu, Fu Yuan, and Fu Tai six money shops, yesterday jointly hosted members of the Shanghai press to explain several points regarding the Ministry of Finance's disapproval of their business operations: (1) The four banks are branch offices approved by the Ministry of Finance to be established in Shanghai. The six money shops had suspended operations during the war and had been approved by the Ministry of Finance to resume operations. (2) The Ministry of Finance seems to mistakenly believe that setting up more banks and money shops will fuel speculation and disrupt the financial market. In reality, each bank or money shop requires at least 400 to 500 million yuan in capital. Moreover, due to the relationship of absorbing deposits, it is estimated that the ten banks and money shops can absorb at least several hundred billion yuan of floating capital. (3) The Ministry of Finance has measures to manage banks. If the banks and money shops that have already been approved are found to have businesses that do not comply with regulations, they can be banned afterward. Moreover, during this gold rush, the Ministry of Finance thoroughly investigated the account books of various banks and money shops and determined that they were unrelated. (4) As the government enters the constitutional period, it should complete the legislative process and provide people with some period of consideration. (5) It takes several months, or even more than a year, from the application to the approval of business operations for banks and money shops. After approval, the banks and money shops raise capital, find business locations, and recruit employees, which costs a considerable amount. Once disapproved, the losses are enormous, and the unemployment problem of employees is worrisome. (6) Since approval, the banks and money shops have been actively preparing. Internal business has already begun. Therefore, it is necessary to request the Judicial Yuan to interpret the "opening" of the business as referred to by the Ministry of Finance.

### Sharp Reduction in Steel Paper Production After Restrictions on Raw Material Imports

According to a major figure in the steel paper industry, steel paper for packaging is widely used by cigarette factories and candy factories in the city. Among them, the cigarette industry uses it the most. In the past, most of the steel paper used by the factories was produced by the Hua Aluminum Steel Paper Factory and distributed to the factories. However, the factory's main raw material imports have been reduced a month ago, so production is extremely small, and shipments have been stopped for three or four months, causing an extreme shortage of steel paper on the market. Each cigarette factory has plans to abolish packaging. It is reported that the factory is now actively applying for foreign exchange to order raw materials from abroad. As soon as the raw materials arrive, it will continue to increase production to meet market demand.

### Merchants Request Reissuance of Consular Visas for Bills of Lading

### New York Silver Market Weakens Again, Down One-Quarter of a Cent

### New York Sausage Casings Plunge, Export Prospects Dim

### Coal Merchants Urge the Government to Improve the Rationing Method, Collective Procurement and Sales, and Increase the Quantity

[Reported by this newspaper] The majority of the 800 members of the Shanghai Coal Business Association recently stated that the Fuel Management Committee's allocation of coal to them is not distributed equally. In recent months, it has been in a state of stagnation. At the same time, self-managed coal halls have been bought out at official prices. Therefore, they plan to build a sincere association and request the government to improve two points: (1) If the control still exists, please separate the official and private sectors. The coal used by private factories should be handled by coal merchants, and the government should designate mining areas and approve the quantity. With the association's certification, collective procurement and sales should be allowed, and sales should be made at prices approved by the competent authority. (2) Increase the rationed quantity, continuously month by month, to maintain the livelihood of the coal industry. It is said that the proposal... has been signed and sealed by 800 coal shops, and is prepared to be submitted to the association for discussion today.

Coal Market Lingers on a Weary Path

Sporadic arrivals of Jiaozuo white coal continued, and market prices edged down again. Hong... white coal has recently been in short supply, and sales are unique. Regardless of screened lumps, small lumps, or ash, market prices for all grades have remained firm and stable. The market for bituminous coal is difficult to weaken. Actual sales have absorbed dips, so a turnaround is possible. Arrivals in the charcoal market are too abundant, and market prices continue to fall, already approaching cost. Due to weak actual sales of coal balls, factories have automatically reduced factory prices. Except for Guohua, which is still quoted at 560,000 yuan, Yitaixing and others have reduced prices to 540,000 to 550,000 yuan. In addition to Southern factories which still require 520,000 yuan, other small factories are all at 500,000 yuan.

### Truman's Appeal: Request to Congress for Loans to Greece and Turkey, Support for Assisting Free Nations, Full Text of Speech, United States Information Service

President Truman today (Washington, 12th) delivered an important foreign policy speech at a special joint session of both houses of Congress here, requesting $400 million in aid for Greece and Turkey. The President also requested approval to send American public and military personnel to Greece and Turkey to assist in reconstruction work and to oversee the use of American aid.

President Truman stated: In the current gloomy situation, "almost every nation must choose between two ways of life. I believe that the policy of the United States must be to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."

The President then pointed to the Greek civil war and the Greek government's recent note to the United States requesting financial and economic assistance.

The President said: "The very existence of the Greek nation is today threatened by the terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by Communists, who defy the government in a number of areas, particularly along the northern borders. A commission appointed by the United Nations Security Council is currently investigating the disturbances in northern Greece and the violations of the border along Greece and Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, the Greek government is unable to cope with the situation. The Greek army is small and poorly equipped. It needs supplies and equipment to restore the authority of the government throughout Greek territory.

Greece Desires Self-Reliance, The United States Should Provide Assistance

Greece needs help if it is to become a self-respecting, self-supporting democracy. The United States must supply that help. We have already extended to Greece certain kinds of relief and economic aid, but these are inadequate. There is no other country to which democratic Greece can turn except the United States. No other nation is willing and able to provide the support necessary for a democratic Greek government.

The British government, which has been helping Greece, can no longer afford to provide financial or economic aid after March 31st. Great Britain finds itself under the necessity of reducing or liquidating its commitments in several parts of the world, including Greece.

We have considered how the United Nations might assist in this crisis. But the situation is an immediate one, requiring immediate action, and the United Nations and its related agencies are not in a a position to extend the kind of help that is required.

Greece has asked us to provide assistance so that it can effectively utilize any financial or other assistance we may give and improve its administrative facilities. This is worthy of mention. Most important, we must supervise the use of the money we give to Greece, ensuring that every dollar is spent in a way that helps Greece become self-sufficient and assists it in establishing a democratic economy.

No government is perfect. The great virtue of a democratic government is that its defects are always visible and can be pointed out and corrected through democratic processes. The Greek government is not perfect, but it certainly represents 85 percent of the members of the Greek parliament, who were elected in elections last year. Observers (including those from the United States) generally agreed that the election was a fair expression of the will of the Greek people.

The Greek government has been operating in an environment of chaos and extremism. The Greek government's measures have often been flawed. Our assistance does not mean that the United States sympathizes with all the past actions of the Greek government. We have condemned and do condemn the extreme measures of both the left and the right. We have advised tolerance in the past and continue to advise it now.

Ensure Turkey's Integrity, Maintain Order in the Middle East

Greece's neighbor, Turkey, also deserves our attention.

The future of Turkey as an independent and economically sound state is no less important to the freedom-loving peoples of the world than is the future of Greece. The circumstances in which Turkey finds itself today are very different from those of Greece. Turkey has been spared the disasters that Greece has suffered. During the war, Great Britain and the United States provided Turkey with material assistance, but Turkey still needs our support today.

Since the war, Turkey has requested economic assistance from Great Britain and the United States in order to carry out the modernization necessary to maintain its national integrity. The integrity of Turkey is essential to the maintenance of order in the Middle East.

The British government has informed us that, due to its own difficulties, it can no longer provide financial or economic assistance to Turkey. As with Greece, if Turkey needs assistance, the United States must provide it. We are the only country that can provide this kind of assistance.

The United States faces considerable difficulties in providing assistance to Greece and Turkey, and I fully recognize this fact. I would like to discuss these difficulties with you at this time.

A major goal of American foreign policy is to create conditions under which we and other nations can develop a way of life free from coercion. This was the fundamental issue in the war against Germany and Japan. These nations, which attempted to force their will on others, are the nations we have defeated.

To ensure the peaceful development of all nations and to protect them from coercion, the United States has taken the lead in establishing the United Nations. The purpose of the United Nations is to ensure that all member states can achieve lasting freedom and independence. We cannot achieve our goals unless we are willing to help free peoples maintain their governments and national integrity and resist any aggressive movements that seek to promote totalitarian regimes. In other words, this is also to recognize that totalitarian regimes imposed on free peoples, whether by direct or indirect aggression, undermine international peace and the security of the United States.

Oppose Totalitarian Rule, Eliminate Cunning Tactics

There are many nations and peoples in the world who oppose totalitarian rule, but recently, many totalitarian regimes have been imposed upon them. The United States government has repeatedly protested the acts of intimidation and oppression that violate the Yalta Agreement in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries. I must also state that similar situations are occurring in some other countries.

In the current period of world history, almost every nation must choose between two ways of life. This choice is often not entirely free.

One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, expressed through free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom from political oppression.

The other way of life is based upon the will of a minority, imposed upon the majority by force. It relies upon terror, oppression, control of the press, control of radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedom.

I believe that the policy of the United States must be to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures. I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way. I believe that our help should primarily be in the form of economic and financial aid, which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes.

The world is not static, and the status quo is not sacred. But we cannot allow changes in the status quo that violate the Charter of the United Nations, such as cunning tactics like political infiltration. In helping free and independent nations to maintain their freedom, the United States will be giving effect to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

Destruction of Free Institutions Endangers the Entire World

We only need to look at the map to see that the survival and integrity of Greece are extremely important. If Greece were to fall under the control of an armed minority, it would have a serious direct impact on its neighbor Turkey, and could even lead to chaos throughout the Middle East.

But if Greece were to lose its status as an independent nation, it would have a major impact on the countries of Europe. The people of these countries are currently struggling to maintain their freedom and independence in the face of great difficulties, while still repairing the damage caused by the war.

These countries have long struggled against the forces of tyranny. They have made great sacrifices to win victory. It would be an indescribable tragedy to lose the fruits of that victory today. The destruction of free institutions and the loss of independence not only harms them, but also the entire world. This fate will quickly affect other neighboring countries that are struggling to ensure their freedom and independence, making their fate one of despondency, disappointment, and possible failure.

At this critical juncture, if we fail to aid Greece and Turkey, the profound implications will extend beyond the East and reach the West.

We must take decisive action immediately.

Therefore, I recommend to Congress that it approve a loan of $400 million to Greece and Turkey before June 30, 1948. In making this loan request, I have considered the largest amount that can be allocated to aid to Greece from the $350 million relief fund. This is the sum that I previously requested Congress to approve, the purpose of which is to prevent famine and suffering in countries that have been devastated by war.

In addition to the loan, I request Congress to approve the dispatch of American public and military personnel to Greece and Turkey to assist those countries in their recovery and to supervise the use of the financial and material assistance provided by the United States, as requested by those countries. I recommend that Congress also authorize us to instruct and train selected personnel to go to Greece and Turkey.

Invest in Freedom and Peace, Actively and Responsibly Protect

Finally, I ask Congress to grant the authority so that the appropriations it may make can be used most quickly and effectively to supply urgently needed goods, supplies, and equipment.

Furthermore, if other funds and authority are needed to achieve the goals described in this message, I will immediately inform Congress.

In this respect, the executive and legislative branches of government must cooperate and unite.

The path we are taking is extremely serious. I would not be making this recommendation if the alternative were not even more serious.

The United States spent $341,000,000,000 to win the Second World War. This was an investment in world freedom and world peace.

The aid to Greece and Turkey that I am recommending costs just slightly more than one-thousandth of that investment. It is just common sense that we should protect this investment and ensure that it is not squandered.

The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by hardship and want. These seeds spread and grow in the poor soil of poverty and struggle. When the hope of the people for a better life disappears, the seeds of totalitarian regimes reach full maturity. We must keep that hope alive.

Free peoples around the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedom. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world, and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation.

I am confident that Congress will face this responsibility with great courage.

Truman's Demeanor During Speech

### Crowds Rolling! Silver Dollars Dancing! Reno: Gambler's "Paradise" Reno Aviation News, February 24

— Our Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

There are four major "gambling nations" in the world: Gibraltar, supported by the British; Morocco, run by the French; Macau, controlled by the Portuguese; and Reno, organized by the Americans themselves. I was in Switzerland two years ago and saw the gambling dens across the river from Locarno on the Swiss-Italian border. At the time, I deeply lamented the appeal of "gambling." Many European princes, politicians in exile, and wealthy tycoons gathered in that small space, tirelessly day and night. After spending four days in Reno this time, I realized that the high-stakes gambling in this kingdom of capitalism is even more astonishing.

### Doors Unlocked at Night, The Sun Never Sets

Stacks of silver dollars piled up like small hills, long tables, round tables, square tables, all packed with people, the indoor lighting shining like daylight, and dazzling hostesses welcoming customers for the casino bosses. In the smoky, noisy space, one only sees silver dollars dancing non-stop. Radios broadcast soft music one moment and report the winning numbers of "White Corner Tickets" (lottery tickets) the next. Thousands of men and women concentrate all their mental energy on the wins and losses of those numbers, feeling fresh, interesting, and excited.

Reno is a city where the sun never "sets," a city that never sleeps. Night is the time for the people of Reno to work and celebrate. On the most popular North Virginia Street, neon lights of all colors shine on the smooth, flat, and wide road. The doors of the casinos are never locked, and they have never been closed for a single minute. Moreover, there are never any cases of theft or robbery in Reno. I asked many honest local people, and they all said in unison: Reno is a unique society where "doors are never locked at night."

Entertainment Venues, Prospering From Divorce Cases

I said in a dispatch about "Divorce City": Reno's divorce cases require six consecutive weeks of residency. Six weeks may not be too long, but for those well-fed, idle, and leisured classes, coming to the desolate state of Nevada to handle divorce cases and sitting and waiting for six weeks is not easy to "pass" the time. The seventy-two hotels, one hundred and one bars, fifty casinos, fifteen dance halls, and all kinds of entertainment venues in Reno are mostly parasitic on the basic law of "divorce." According to a Reno news colleague, the importance of gambling is gradually surpassing the basic factor of divorce in the prosperity and development of Reno's city. Because only Nevada has no gambling ban in the entire United States, the provincial government not only does not ban gambling, but also uses all its power to support the prosperity of the gambling industry. Nevada has a population of only 150,000, and Reno accounts for 35,000. Therefore, American gamblers flock to Reno from all directions. These people have nothing to do with divorce. Their interest is gambling, not "sex."

Casino Statistics, Known as the Three Strong, Six Strong

During my short four-day stay, I lingered in the casinos every night. Among the fifty or so casinos, only six are the largest. The people of Reno call them the Big Six; but among these six, only three control the leadership, so they are also known as the Big Three. They all use the title of "Club," the so-called "Three Strong" are the Palace Club, the Harold's Club, and the Bank Club.

The Palace Club has the longest history. Its advertisements are all called with "oldest qualification, best reputation." According to the Palace owner Hao, the Palace Club has been at the corner of Central Road and Commercial Road for fifty-nine years. Inside it has three large roulette machines, three dice-rolling equipment, fourteen "Keno" tables, twelve poker square tables, and a large White Corner Ticket counter. The Palace has 270 employees, divided into three shifts, each working eight hours a day. In terms of the salary expenses of employees alone, the total amount each year is $1.07 million.

Among the employees of the Palace Club, one-third are women. The work of female employees is mostly to control the roulette machines and "Keno" dealers. Their salaries vary, but are at least $90 per week.

### Harold's Casino Owner, Is Reno's Richest Man

Among the current "Three Strong," the most "energetic" one is Harold's Club. Many people in the eastern and southern United States are thousands of miles away from Reno and have never been to Reno, but they all know about the Harold's Casino. The reason is that the owner, Smith, is good at management and understands the effectiveness of advertising. The roads and railways near Reno are filled with Harold's advertisements. Smith himself told me that his advertisements cover the world.

On the eve of my departure from New York, I met a Greek merchant from Boston, Kostas Corelis. This pot-bellied merchant in his fifties is one of Harold's regulars. He often secretly goes to Reno to gamble for a day or two without telling his wife, and then secretly returns to Boston. Because of his introduction, I had the opportunity to meet that Reno "gambling king" Smith.

Smith received me in a building next to the casino. That was the office of his gambling company, with secretaries and typists. Smith is the last name, his first name is "Lai," about 55 years old, when young, he did not work, and he messed around in California and gradually learned many gambling secrets. Shortly after Nevada's development, he mixed into Reno and opened Harold's Casino. Now he is the richest man in Reno, but he says he is just a manager. I asked him who the real owner of Harold's was, and he replied very cleverly: "My two sons and one daughter."

He wrote down the names of his children for me, the eldest son is called Smith Harold, using the name of the casino, the second son is called Smith Lai, inheriting his own name, and the daughter is called Smith Dorothy. In addition to the daughter, the two sons can inherit his mantle and understand the mysteries of gambling. He said that Harold's has different employees due to different seasons. There are 300 employees in the summer when it is busy, and about 250 employees in the winter when the turnover is smaller.

### Gambling Experts, Train Casino Employees

He said: Harold's daily salary and expenses for employees average $5,000, and the total annual amount is more than $1.8 million. Harold's currently has 33 gambling tables and 50 to 60 machines. In order to make money, gambling itself must have many techniques. The staff are all "specially trained." After completing eight hours of work, they take one or two hours of classes in rotation. The training class has three gambling experts who are responsible for teaching.

Speaking of the history of Harold's, Smith is quite emotional and quite comforted. He said that it took a lot of effort to open Harold's, and it was finally realized in 1935. When it first opened, "it was very pitiful, there were only two machines in total, and they were used by others!" He said with an infinitely vicissitudes of life.

The people of Reno said that Smith is the leader of the local society of "gang organizations," and some people also told me that when meeting him, one should be more careful when speaking. But I see him with a rather kind face. I asked him how much Harold's has a year turnover? How much money can you win? He smiled naively: "This is a secret, I can't tell you!"

"But," he continued, "I can answer you: the total income of all casinos in Nevada last year was 21 million yuan, of which 10 percent was paid to the provincial government. The total turnover of the gambling industry is about 97 times the profit, of which summer accounts for two-thirds and winter accounts for one-third. As for the origin of gamblers, 19 percent are from Nevada, and 81 percent are from various provinces and foreign countries. Foreigners account for about 2 percent, and those from the capital Washington account for about 2 percent."

I don't know if his numbers are completely reliable. When he said it, it was indeed based on evidence. I asked him: Have you ever been to Morocco, Gibraltar, and Macau? He said that he had never been to a foreign country, but he hoped to have the opportunity for an "overseas study."

### Various Gambling Methods: Keno and Roulette

Speaking of which, I should introduce: Among Reno's gambling varieties, the most common is "Keno," two playing cards where twenty points is the maximum. The next is the thirty-six-number roulette, similar to China's "pressing treasures," where if you bet correctly, you can win thirty-five times, but you can also bet on three, four, five, or even twelve numbers at the same time. Next is dice throwing, which is completely different from Chinese dice. It's a wooden, boat-shaped table, as large as a small fishing boat, with gamblers standing around it. The tabletop is painted with various squares like roulette. Gamblers place money on different squares according to their luck. The gambling hall employees are the "house," and there are two of them, holding sticks like golf clubs, loudly calling out the dice numbers. Gamblers take turns throwing the dice, in the order they are standing. The "house" doesn't throw the dice, showing they have no cheating, but you only see their two sticks, constantly hooking silver dollars game after game. Sometimes, gamblers win, but that's just a minority.

Cantonese Overseas Chinese Love to Play "White Ticket"

I watched for two nights and still didn't understand the winning rules. I only saw two: somewhat clumsy-looking large dice, constantly jumping. Americans, especially returning veterans from the Marines, are quite fond of gambling with dice. The "business" at the dice table is the most prosperous. In addition, the lottery (White Ticket) is also quite lively. Chinese overseas Chinese from Guangdong are most interested in "White Ticket" when they gamble in Reno.

White Ticket is different from the so-called lottery in Shanghai. Chinese lotteries draw prizes only once every half month or month, while White Ticket can draw prizes forty or fifty times a night. Its English name is Race Horse Keno, but in reality, it has nothing to do with "horse racing." It's just a small paper with eighty squares drawn on it. Gamblers use ink pens to randomly select ten squares from the eighty. Bets range from a dime to five thousand dollars, depending on how much you want to bet. The gambling hall draws prizes every twenty minutes, drawing twenty numbers each time. If five of the ten numbers you selected match the ones drawn, you can get double the prize money. If six or seven match, you can get dozens of times the prize money. If all ten match, a fifty-cent ticket can win over two thousand dollars.

Because the attraction is so great, there are many people gambling on "White Ticket." It seems easy, but it's actually complex. In higher algebra, the "probability" can easily calculate the chances of winning, how many in the hundreds or thousands? Out of curiosity, I also tried buying it more than ten times, and only once matched five numbers, winning two dimes from one dime.

The most important point is that in every type of gambling, the opponent is the gambling hall owner, who uses employees to execute on his behalf. Gamblers don't gamble with each other. This is Reno's gambling principle. Their employees all wear very meticulous white uniforms, speak very kindly and politely, and never argue with customers in any situation. Gamblers from all over the world come here and lose money, especially those divorced with leisure class. Their emotions are inevitably bad, spending six weeks in the gambling hall. Although they know they are "giving away money," because the employees are kind and gentle, the customers' spirits are always happy.

Golden Season: More Gamblers in Summer

"One summer eats three winters." Summer is Nevada's golden season. When I arrived in Reno, it was winter. In winter, gamblers aren't very enthusiastic. I suspect many tables have disguised customers sitting at them, who are actually "plainclothes" gambling hall employees.

The most elegant gambling is "Bingo," like playing Go. Many people sit around a large round table playing. The host uses a lottery method, drawing and calling out various numbers. Gamblers put black pieces on the numbers. Whoever fills a straight line first is the winner. The fee for each game of "Bingo" ranges from five cents to twenty-five cents, and the prize money ranges from six dollars to one hundred dollars. The "Bingo" gambling hall is separate and not within the large gambling hall. I saw many American old ladies playing "Bingo" to pass the whole day.

Common Gambling Device: "Slot Machine"

Besides these, there's also a very common gambling device that has penetrated every rural area of Nevada. Its name is Jack Pot, which literally translates to "hand-pulled gambling machine" (slot machine). From the so-called three largest gambling halls to rural grocery stores, coffee shops, restaurants, bus stations, and airports, they are almost everywhere. Its advantage is that there's no need for an owner to manage it. When customers are happy, they put a five-cent coin in, then pull the "switch" on the side, and the roulette in the machine automatically rolls. If you win, it will automatically drop three, five, or even ten or twenty coins. If you don't win, then the original coin is swallowed by the machine.

How the machine is constructed is a secret. Generally, on average, after pulling it a certain number of times, it won't disappoint gamblers too much, but if you play for a long time, customers will definitely lose everything. It is said that the inventor is now one of the richest people in America. Every year, gambling halls, grocery stores, and coffee shops throughout Nevada earn a considerable amount from "hand-pulled machines." There are machines that cost five cents to pull, as well as those that cost a dime and those that cost a quarter. Although the bets aren't large, they accumulate a lot, so they shouldn't be taken lightly.

I asked gambling king Smith about the invention and manufacturing of the machines. He said he didn't know who invented the machine. However, the machines are made in Chicago, and the factory's name is "Pance," on Indian Avenue in Chicago. Machines are shipped in large quantities from Chicago to Nevada, divided into two types of transactions. Large clubs simply buy them outright, while small grocery stores rent them from the factory, with rental fees varying, some even reaching five or six thousand dollars per year.

Smith continued: It's a pity that only Nevada has opened up gambling, otherwise, that company would make even more money!

Make a fortune, make a fortune. Don't you see thousands of silver dollars spinning in Reno! In this gambling hall where you can't see banknotes, the clanging sound of silver coins flying, the loud sound of number lotteries, and the sighs and shouts of gamblers are all mixed together. People pour in and out like a tide. The various types of cars in front of the club doors are always like flowing water, coming and going non-stop. These people seem to have no worries, no sorrows, no grief, and no melancholy. Who says Nevada's desert is like hell? Who doesn't believe that the "gambling city" of Reno symbolizes paradise on earth? (In Nevada)

Military Training in Schools Should Not Be Stopped

The fact that high schools and above have military training is because our highest authorities want to correct the customs of separating literary and military paths and the entire nation's emphasis on literature over military affairs, to reverse the decline and strive for national survival. It was first trialed in schools in the Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui regions, and later, due to the government's active promotion and the enthusiastic response of the education authorities, it became a trend in the twenty-fourth and fifth years. All youths with blood considered the combination of literary and military, and the combination of skill and virtue as the supreme glory. The sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge announced their opportunity to serve the country. Whether in the front or rear, carrying the wounded, cooking tea and rice, and in the ranks of returning home, there were traces of them. In particular, the Knowledge Youth Joining the Army Movement advocated by the Chairman, they were even more passionate and responded enthusiastically without hesitation! The great call of ten thousand youths and ten thousand soldiers, who can say that it is not a concrete manifestation of the results of military training in schools? If we review the history of military training in the past ten years, if we speak from a technical perspective, because of the lack of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, it is still far from our ideal goal. If we speak from a lifestyle and ideological perspective, its success cannot be denied. The art of war says: "Those whose peacetime life is consistent with wartime life survive, and those whose opposite die"; the Prime Minister also revealed to us: "Belief arises from thought, and power arises from belief." The ability of youth during wartime to endure hardship, unite and struggle, and under the leadership of one government, one ideology, and one leader, collectively work together and move forward bravely is by no means accidental! If we divide military training into three departments: technical training, life training, and ideological training, its success or failure, gains and losses, are self-evident. We must not give up eating because of choking and doubt our basic national policy. We should strive to improve in terms of equipment, organization, and personnel, so that it can truly exert the greatest function of mastering command, training, management, and administration, and lay a solid foundation for young people to establish themselves, establish others, establish virtue, and establish merit from the rectification of the academic atmosphere. And supplement the shortcomings of school training with centralized training, then the future achievements will be even more mutually beneficial. If school military training is stopped and only one year of centralized training is given after graduating from high school, regardless of whether this training can be popularized to every knowledgeable youth, even if they can all participate in this training, it can be said to be abandoning the fundamental for the superficial, and fundamentally losing the meaning of incorporating military into learning! As the saying goes: "Schools are a microcosm of the country." Only with healthy schools can we cultivate healthy talents. Only with healthy talents can we build a strong country. To enable the youth of the whole country to be loyal to the nation and shoulder the arduous mission of inheriting the past and forging the future, and building and reviving the country, we must closely coordinate military affairs and education, and then military affairs can exert its effectiveness, and education can achieve the expected results. In this pressing situation and the era of the omnipotence of science, if military affairs are separated from education, it is equivalent to losing the soul; if education is separated from military affairs, it is equivalent to having no backbone. Various European and American countries have added military training in elementary schools, and we only have military training in high schools and above, which, in comparison, is already insufficient. We want to build a country, we want to revive, and we want to maintain the glorious achievements gained through eight years of arduous struggle. Our school military training must not only not be stopped but also strive for its popularization and improvement. (Shu Yue)

Refund of Further Education Fees Should Be Implemented

Editor:

I read in the newspaper that "the academic further education fees for teachers and staff of municipal schools have been included in the budget by the Municipal Council, and the schools have been ordered to refund the fees collected from students." It shows that the councilors are concerned about the people's livelihood and reducing the burden on parents, which is admirable. However, at present, some municipal schools are still urging students to pay this further education fee, and those who have paid have no hope of a refund. Parents are naturally reluctant to go and ask for it, fearing to hurt feelings. If this is the case, then the municipal schools can still comply in public but defy in private, and refuse to return the money. I would like to ask the Education Bureau to promptly order all schools to return the collected "academic further education fees for teachers and staff" by a specific date, to respect public opinion.

### Notes on Viewing Paintings and Calligraphy

— Pan Boying

Mr. Zhang Boju of Zhongzhou is skilled in lyrics and music, and especially good at connoisseurship. His collection of famous calligraphy and paintings has long been famous at home and abroad. The true copy of Lu Shiheng's "Ping Fu Tie" is especially noteworthy, dating back to ancient times. I admired him, but did not get to meet him. Recently, my friend Mr. Xie Zhiliu, together with Boju and Shen Yinmo, met the supervisor. I was invited to see the works he brought recently. I was overjoyed. The next day, I made an appointment to meet Boju again, and got to see several more scrolls. In a hurry, the smoke and clouds passed before my eyes. I've briefly noted what I can remember as a contribution to our conversation.

1.  True Copy of Fan Zhongyan's Small Regular Script "Ode to the Taoist Robe" - Fan Wenzheng's calligraphy is a dramatic treasure in China. It has already been engraved in the Sanxitang Calligraphy Album. The original was brought to Dong Province by Ruzi Yi, and when the Japanese surrendered, Yi was captured by the army. This calligraphy and other treasures reappeared. Looking at its mounting, it is still from the Qianlong period. The outer brocade cover has a light blue background with white patterns. The inner cover is white silk. On the silk, there is a long rectangular shape with a silk double bar of about three inches. Within the shape, there are three lines written in ink, noting Fan Zhongyan's Ode to the Taoist Robe and the fact that it was collated by Minister Zhang Zhao, etc. As for the Ode to the Taoist Robe itself, it is mounted as a scroll. The jade slip on the outside is engraved with the words "Qianlong's Imperial Appreciation" and "Fan Zhongyan's Ode to the Taoist Robe" in clerical script. Fan Gong's calligraphy is leisurely, open, harmonious and quiet, making great use of the technique of dividing the brush. The traces of his brushstrokes at the beginning, ending, and transition points can all be found. Yinmo said, "His free brushwork is extremely far-reaching, but his ending is very tight," echoing what Huang Tingjian said in his postscript, praising it as understanding the ancient methods. I fully agree with the two postscripts by Wen Yuke and Wu Pao. In short, one cannot know the flaws of the Sanxitang engraving without seeing the true copy. This is truly a rare treasure.

2.  Huang Luzhi's Cursive Script Long Scroll - This treasure was also once in the Qing Palace's collection. The jade slip is the same as the one for the Ode to the Taoist Robe. However, there is no brocade cover, which must have been lost. Huang Tingjian's calligraphy completely models after Huai Su's Autobiography, but does not copy his traces. He is also quite self-assured in his postscript.

3.  Mi Fu's Ten Calligraphy Copy Scroll - Mi Fu's Ten Calligraphy are all scattered drafts, not complete from beginning to end. The first two calligraphy are extremely exquisite. In the midst of a strong wind and powerful horses, there is a feeling of strict rules. The brushstrokes of the rest are slightly different from the former. Shen Yinweng believes that it may be calligraphy by Wu Ju that was mistakenly inserted. This is a very insightful opinion. But it does not detract from it being beautiful calligraphy.

4.  Portrait of Ziyun Scroll - This scroll was created by Chen Qinian for Tong Jiuqing and is extremely famous in China. Almost all the famous artists of the early Qing Dynasty wrote poems on it. In the scroll, Ziyun looks very plump, with extremely beautiful eyebrows and eyes. It is a pity that no one has written a text on it based on the psychology of Ellis and Freud. Thinking about it, it is quite funny.

5.  Flower Scroll by the Four Beauties of the Late Ming Dynasty - This is a scroll painted by Wang Bogu for the Four Beauties of the Late Ming Dynasty: Wu Juanjuan, Ma Xianglan, Lin Xue, and Wang ×× (forgotten). Wu painted daffodils, Ma painted daylilies, Lin painted chrysanthemums, and Wang painted winter plum blossoms. It is said to represent the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Before it, there is a joint poem by the Four Beauties, written by Xianglan. After it, there is a postscript by Bogu, titled "Layman Zunsheng."

6.  Dongting Diagram Scroll - This diagram has been painted by many people, from Yun Shouping and Yu Zhiding to several other artists. Each person has one painting. Almost all the famous public figures of the early Qing Dynasty have written inscriptions on it. The Yun Xitang family wrote two inscriptions, one poem and one prose. Nalan Rongruo and Gu Liangfen used the same rhyme to write two lyrics, which Rongruo wrote. They are mounted into four scrolls, which is also a magnificent sight. This is an excellent source of information for studying the author of "Dream of the Red Chamber." I wonder if Mr. Hu Shi, who is now a "pawn crossing the river," still has this leisure and elegance?

7.  Dong Qichang's Small Landscape Scroll - This was also once in the Qing Palace's collection, and had an inscription by Emperor Gaozong recording the years when he had imitated it. Dong Qichang wrote that distant mountains must show height and depth to gain momentum, and clustered trees must show leaning up and down to have emotion. He often used this saying and few people who understood it. It is his proud brushwork. Another paper that is mounted later contains poems by Zuo Taichong and others written by Dong Qichang. It is written in small regular script within an inch and is very beautiful.

8.  Zhao Mengfu's Orchids and Ni Ji's Walking Joint-mounted Scroll - This was once owned by Prince Cheng. The title slip is still in Prince Cheng's handwriting. Both paintings are not large, and are not carefully crafted. But the casual brushwork shows the revealing of natural creation. Zhao Mengfu's orchids seem to be especially prone to wind.

9.  Five-Family Album Scroll of Yuan Dynasty - This scroll is very large, and the names of the five families are no longer remembered in detail. Only remember that there is a plum blossom branch by Wang Yuan. All five papers are ink paintings, all exquisite. One of them has Shen Zhou's collection seal. This is the first time I have seen Shen Zhou's appreciation seal.

10. Zhao Mengjian's Poetry and Painting Long Scroll - This is the former property of Wu Liqian of Nanhai. The title at the beginning of the scroll is written by Liqian. There is a very small painting at the front, depicting several narcissus stems. After that, there are more than ten chapters of poetry written by Zhao Mengjian himself in running cursive script. His poems are full of feelings of loyalty and love, and talk and laugh about the ups and downs of life, self-assertive and unique, forming his own style. After the poems, there is a postscript in clerical script, quoting Bai Juyi to compare himself. I observe that his poems are of a different form than Bai Juyi's, but are not ashamed of Bai Juyi. His writing is both dignified and unrestrained, between Cai Xiang and Mi Fu. Its structure and breath are all of the Song Dynasty. It is not like Zhao Mengfu, who has already opened up the style of the Yuan Dynasty. Zhao Mengfu's calligraphy has truly exhausted his natural talent and learning, and can use the ancient to create the new. Although Zhao Mengjian's calligraphy cannot be said to be beyond Zhao Mengfu's reach, it is definitely not something that Zhao Mengfu can surpass. What is valuable is the spirit of strangeness and boldness on the whole paper, which all comes from ancient methods. If we discuss it in this way, it can be directly said to exceed Zhao Mengfu. The Wu family once hooked and copied this scroll and engraved it in the Haishan Xianguan Album. Today, on the true copy, one can still see the traces of carelessness left during the copying process. Alas, Zhao Mengjian and Zhao Mengfu, the two brothers are hard to tell who is better. As for abandoning the glory of the floating world and establishing the rules of human relations, the so-called shaking one's clothes a thousand feet and washing one's feet ten thousand miles, then Zhao Mengjian is far away from the people! (Recorded by the lamp on March 11)

### Review of Zhao Tongyin's Paintings

— Bai Yuzhu

Zhao Jun's strengths are seen quite well in landscape paintings. Zhao Jun has always been versed in Chinese painting. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, he traveled extensively in the western, southern, northern, and various provinces, so what he painted was definitely not copied from ancient painting books, but took natural objects entirely. Wherever his footsteps reached, his brush and ink reached.

Moreover, he stepped and climbed wherever he saw the most difficult and dangerous places. The peaks of Zhongnan Mountain and Cui Bi, as well as the Yingtai Mountain, etc., all take true scenery. Especially the Zhongnan Mountain painting, is subtle and far reaching.

Jianmen Pass, the number one pass in Western Qin, and the Baocheng Shimen painting, etc., are all boardwalk scenery. The Jianmen painting is surrounded by smoke and clouds, making people imagine. Fang Weng's line about riding a horse in the drizzle is even more poetic.

The Yulei Pass of Guanxian in Western Sichuan, and the Elephant Trunk Stone painting, etc., either see its danger, or see its wonder. The Changdao Temple Waterfall and the Xixin Pavilion painting of Qingcheng Mountain are slightly similar to the scenery of the Southeast. But the Ascending Heaven Ladder is completely different, and it cannot be written by those who have not experienced its danger.

The Hua Mountain painting include Qinkeping, Jade Maiden Peak, and the Canglong Ridge, and the steep mountain road of the Canglong Ridge with cliffs is purely a life-sketching brushstroke, which also has a unique style. As the inscription says, "Two cliffs of iron chains and ten thousand feet of bitter vines."

Other works, such as flowers and plants, are plum blossoms, chrysanthemums, peonies, wisteria, etc., which Zhao Jun is good at. However, the artistic conception of Fangzhushan Yong seems ordinary. There are also a few small landscape paintings, such as the spring colors of Hukou and the white clouds coming out of the mountain, which are all beautiful and worthy.

### Concerning Xu Yian

— Zhan Weng

Mr. Liang Lieya, in his article "Recording Jianjiang's Paintings," praised Mr. Xu Yian as a literary giant of the time, and mentioned that he was on friendly terms with such figures as Taiyan and Zhang Jizhi. Mr. Yian was not one to seek fame, and few knew of him. From what I know, although Master Xu studied the classics, he did not seem to be an adversary of Taiyan. However, his poetic power was unmatched within the country. Yet, even those who knew his poetry were not widespread, so I have written this article to share with readers.

Yian's surname was Xu, personal name Chengyao, courtesy name Yisou, from Tangmo Village in the western part of She County. He was a successful candidate in the imperial examinations of the Jiawu year of the Guangxu reign, and a Hanlin scholar in the Jiachen year. After the Republic of China was established, he entered Gansu five times, successively serving as the head of the political affairs department of the Gansu Military Governor's and Provincial Governor's Office, and as a Dao Yin (circuit intendant). At fifty, he returned home, closed his doors to study, and never took office again. Last spring, he passed away in his hometown due to illness, enjoying a life of seventy-three years, having lived a life of leisure for twenty years.

When Yian was fifty-three years old, he made a final selection of his poems and published them in six volumes. Today, very few copies remain. His preface roughly stated:

"When I compose poetry, I initially admired Li He and Wen Tingyun, then followed Han Yu back to Du Fu, occasionally glimpsing Tao Qian and Ruan Ji. Among the Song poets, I also took inspiration from Chen Yuyi and Mei Yaochen, with no particular preference, so I resemble none of them in particular. As times change, I only do what suits me, taking what is enough to express my feelings and delight my ears. Zheng Ziyin said he did not think to keep drafts. What about the songs of the laborer? I am also a laborer's song. The joys and sorrows of my life are roughly seen in these, and I cannot bear to discard them, only regretting that there is no one to refine my poems..." The poems written by Yian from the Dingmao to Xinwei years were printed by his friend Wang Jianping, divided into two volumes. The first is prefaced by Jianping. The preface discusses the personality of Yian and the excellence of his poetry, and is quite accurate. Excerpts are as follows:

"Mr. Xu initially studied Changli's poetry, and his five-character ancient verse could capture its spirit. In his later years, living in the Huangshan Mountains, he gradually embraced a more simple and淡泊 style. Therefore, the poems he created became more leisurely and comfortable. However, within this淡泊, there was still 元之致, with a spirit that was 崿, almost making it impossible for people to grasp. However, when you approached him and spoke to him, he would stutter and not be able to engage in lengthy conversations, exuding an elegant refinement and the air of an ancient gentleman... During the years of Guichou and Jiayin, the western frontier was mostly settled, and Mr. Xu relied on his writing for a living. At that time, Lin Tang of Licheng and Huang Xixian of Wu County were skilled in Yuefu poetry, competing in the desolate region. Mr. Xu's thought and skill were unparalleled, and Lin and Huang did not dare to compete with him. Whenever the pear blossoms surrounded the city, and people gathered for gambling and drinking, the elegance of spring outings was unprecedented in this desolate place. Mr. Xu served as a respected guest in the official's tent, and scholars of the time eagerly sought his advice. Although Mr. Xu restrained his sharp edges, he never showed arrogance, and his clarity was like the Jing and Wei rivers, never compromising. The only ones who shared his unwavering integrity and mutual understanding were myself and Lin Tang..."

Yian entered Gansu five times, and his collection is full of vibrant descriptions of the scenery and customs of Gansu, enough to be considered a chronicle of the border city. Before the Xinhai Revolution, Wang Shutong, Yu Mingzhen, and Chen Shi also enjoyed poetry and wine there. However, they could only write small poems, not comparable to Yian.

Yian spent twenty years in his hometown, writing about the mountains and rivers of Xin'an, and his work was extraordinary. His depictions of the strange pines and rocks of Huangshan were particularly outstanding. Mr. Liu Longquan said that since the beginning of Huangshan, there have been countless poets, but none have been able to match Yian. His high regard can be imagined. Yian's Huangshan poems, numbering in the dozens, are all excellent. For example, one of the four poems "From Ciguang Temple to Wenshu Monastery" reads:

"The path has no five steps straight,
But must face utter emptiness.
A withered cliff protrudes its belly,
Forcing people to have no ease.
Following the footsteps on the ladder,
Gazing at the stone, an inch allows a misstep.
Lowering one's head to forbid other gazes,
Slowly climbing with ropes.
Suddenly straddling the top of the cliff,
Confined to a mere three inches.
The sky wind suddenly fiercely churns,
The cloud shadows deeply blurred.
Further up, the road ends completely,
The cliffs uphold ten thousand rocks.
Rushing springs across barren ridges,
Competing for this monkey's path."

About five miles from Ciguang Temple is a place called Wuli Lan, a traverse along sheer cliffs, extremely dangerous. Above it is Daopowen, a path through chaotic rocks with slippery sand. This poem captures the hardship of the ascent, subtle to the last detail. Another of the four poems "Wenshu Monastery" reads:

"A powerful wind comes breaking through the void,
Driving the clouds, trampling the sky.
Startling waves frighten the eyes,
Rushing stones fall on the shoulders.
The peaks easily change their order,
Suddenly appearing before us.
Seen as a boat emerging from a gorge,
A flash and then gone.
Turning one's head, unexpectedly,
The clouds choke and fill the mouth.
Old pines fight the wind,
Like people competing to spread their hands.
Hundreds of props do not break,
Relying on their thick scales.
The mountain spirit pities them,
Not allowing them to endure for long,
Before we finish our meal,
The rising sun is already peeking at the . "

This poem describes the ever-changing pine trees and clouds of Huangshan, with the vitality of a living dragon and tiger. "Climbing Qingliang Terrace" reads:

"Shaking off my clothes on Qingliang Terrace,
All the wonders begin to enter my eyes.
Steep cliffs rise in solitary splendor,
Looking down, I see ten thousand peaks prostrate.
A pine tree leans on a rock,
With sharp edges like carvings.
The pine resembles the shape of the stone,
The stone also resembles the pine's kin.
Bizarre and unnamable,
Fresh and beautiful, just bathed.
Shoulder to shoulder, mutually staggered,
Head to head, each solemn.
Like gathering ten thousand horned dragons,
Hiding them in a valley.
I now caress and possess them,
Playing with them as if they were my children and grandchildren.
With a smile, I recognize Huangshan,
Not disappointing these weary feet."

Huangshan encompasses all things, nothing is not wondrous, but the strange pines and bizarre rocks are its defining features. This poem by Yian captures the strangeness of the pines and rocks, leaving people in awe.

Yian's death is truly a great loss to the poetry world. Mr. Chen Tao'an (Baozhen) most appreciated his poetry, believing that such talent was rare in centuries. Not only could his contemporaries not compete with him. Mr. He Meisheng, an old poet from Min County, saw Yian's poems at Tao'an's place and was utterly impressed. One day, while pacing in his small room, he recited aloud, "Cooling the heart like hair, slightly touching a cicada, I know" (凉心如髮，微逗一蟬知), savoring the endless flavor. His disciple, a certain Mr. X, asked him curiously. Meisheng said, "This is a line from Mr. Xu. I saw it recently at Tao'an's place. It truly rivals the ancients, something modern poets cannot achieve." Tao'an and Meisheng rarely praised the poetry of modern people, but they held Yian in such high regard, demonstrating the depth of Yian's skill, certainly not a matter of personal preference.

### Appreciation of Art

— Xu Shiqi

Appreciation of art is not an easy thing. China has five thousand years of civilization, and the pure art that expresses the highest realm of emotion and personality is calligraphy. We can divide historical periods by the evolution of 体, just as Europe divides eras based on changes in architectural style. Chinese painting is a combination of poetry, calligraphy, and painting into one, forming a unique artistic conception, which is different from the European concept of architecture, sculpture, and painting as a trinity. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the Italian painter Giuseppe Castiglione (郎世寧), who served in the inner court, applied Western sketching methods to Chinese silk, emphasizing rendering and outlining, but lacking vivid brushwork and ink interest. Compared to the more modern masters such as Chen Laolian, Yu Zhiding, and Ren Bonian, the value of his artworks is significantly lower. The reason is simple: Castiglione did not understand Chinese calligraphy, which is an important factor.

The Qing Dynasty painter Zou Yigui criticized Western painting, saying: "The West is good at geometry, so their paintings of light and shadow, distance, are accurate to the smallest detail. The figures, houses, and trees they paint all have shadows. The colors and brushes they use are completely different from those of China. The composition is wide and narrow, using triangles to measure. Painting palaces on walls makes people feel like they want to walk into them. But there is no brushwork at all, so even if it is skillful, it is merely craftsmanship and does not belong to the realm of painting." Zou's criticism of Western painting based on "no brushwork at all, only craftsmanship" is certainly an unreasonable prejudice. It is a pity that he never saw the drawings of Ingres, the masterpieces of Rubens, Vernet, Rembrandt, Goya, and Géricault. Western painting does not lack emphasis on brushwork and touch, which is a fundamental error for Chinese painters who do not appreciate Western art.

The religious art formed by Chinese painting during the Wei, Jin, and Southern Dynasties, and the themes and techniques adopted by ancient Italian painting in Europe, have a tendency to coincide. However, because Chinese calligraphy flourished, poetry developed, and the art of painting was mutually integrated, a special style was formed. Western painting, influenced by the Renaissance and scientific progress of the fifteenth century, focused on the study of light and shadow, and the result was greatly different from Chinese . However, each has its own strengths and values.

The collection and appreciation of artworks has always been a right enjoyed by a special class, with ordinary people rarely having the opportunity to access them. Moreover, there is no establishment of art museums and museums, which leads to the widespread prevalence of forgeries and imitations. Previous artists regarded serving the inner court and being supported by the imperial family as the highest glory, losing the spirit of self-creation and being dominated by objective conditions in their creations, forming a uniform court style.

In recent years, personal exhibitions by artists have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, becoming popular for a time. However, with the exception of a few successful works, there is a tendency to emphasize quantity over quality, reducing the noble sentiments of artists and embarking on the path of utilitarianism. As a result, problems have arisen in the appreciation and creation of art itself. We should rescue this crisis as soon as possible to correct the previous erroneous ideas.

### Professor Kuang Youhan Paints Withered Trees and Bamboo Songs

— Chen Meng'an

Po Gong (Su Shi) loved to paint trees and stones,
His interest came from books and poems;
How many of his true works can we see today?
We can only imagine his techniques.
Withered trees still have life,
Stones can be turned but never moved;
The robust spirit is vigorous and unconstrained,
Uniquely using Mr. Mo (bamboo) to express it;
The inspiration is high, and the painting is completed as the paper runs out,
The onlookers disdainfully sneer.
Later historians competed to imitate,
To consider this as reality is foolish;
Last night, high pavilions were lit with candles,
As if Hou Shan was seeking verses;
Alas, your painting is still just a painting,
Barely gaining some poetic essence in its concrete form;
I need my friend, and my friend needs me,
Looking at each other, we are great masters who agree;
If Su Shi knew, he would laugh loudly,
Exaggerating and wasting words;
This small skill is not worth mentioning,
Better to tear it up and burn it.

### Preface to Huangshan Painting

— Shen Ju

Written for the painter Zhu Qishi

The ancients said: "Whether they are officials or hermits, painters of ancient and modern times must be of high character." Li Sixun was a member of the Tang imperial family, but resigned during the reign of Empress Wu and lived in seclusion, amusing himself with brush and ink. Lu Hongyi was repeatedly summoned to court during the Kaiyuan era, but refused to take office, instead building a thatched cottage to live in. Li Cheng of the Song Dynasty was from Chang'an, and traveled and practiced his art without becoming an official. Wu Zhen of the Yuan Dynasty was upright and aloof, painting plum blossoms, fishing father pictures, and writing fishing father poems, which were passed down to later generations. Ni Yunlin built the Qingbi Pavilion to live in seclusion, painting distant mountains and forests to please himself; Huang Gongwang would go three days without cooking, yet he would still sit under a bean arbor with his belly exposed, leisurely painting Mt. Ju. Bada Shanren, Qingxiang Chenren, and the monk Jianjiang, either fled the world as members of the imperial family or lived in seclusion as eminent monks, pouring their emotions into painting; all had lofty ideals, unrestrained and uninhibited. Therefore, their works were all divinely inspired, and vulgarity could not touch their genius. My friend Zhu Qishi of Jiaxing, served as an official in eastern Zhejiang in his youth, and therefore called himself a mountain dweller of Kuocang. He is of proud character and is proficient in all the arts; his seal carving integrates the styles of Anhui and Zhejiang, his calligraphy embodies the spirit of Qin bronzes and Han stone inscriptions, and his landscape painting follows the style of Dong Yuan, without being bound by rules and regulations, and can be said to have reached the realm of divine inspiration. After settling in Nanhu, he devoted himself to the arts, unwavering in his ambition, and became increasingly transformed. During the War of Resistance, he took refuge from the bandits in Tianmu Mountain; and then re-ascended Huangshan Mountain, searching for the beauty of all thirty-six peaks, and putting them all into his painting bag. Coming to the sea, he closed his door and worked on his art. And soon five days will be spent on a river, and ten days on a mountain, Du Shaoling's so-called Wang Zai's true works, who would have thought that it would be viewed today. Zhu has explored the beauty of Huangshan twice, and when he returns, he dreams of it and talks about it with guests, talks about the steepness of Tiandu Peak, paints for people, paints the elegance of Lianhua Peak; it is as if a mountain spirit is divinely assisting him under his wrist, and the clouds and mist fall on the paper, making it unpredictable. As for the fluidity of the breath and the ancientness of the brush and ink, they are just incidental matters. Knowing that I am fond of his travel journals, he invited me to his residence and showed me several paintings, some lush, some desolate, some towering, some steep, facing them is like being in Tiandu and Lianhua, leisurely seeing the sea of clouds rippling, almost forgetting that I am in the midst of worldly temptations. Zhu said: "The Huangshan paintings are not limited to this, this is just a taste of the whole; the others, vertical, horizontal, large, small, total more than fifty, will be exhibited in the Ningbo Fellow Association gallery soon; and his friends Qin Hanfang, Xu Da, and the two poets Lu, will also be exhibiting hundreds of points of historical materials from the puppet Manchu regime in Changchun, for the exhibition; at that time, you should come and spend half a day admiring them." On the day of the event, I will write a small preface to present to him.

"Ha!" Mizi also mimicked the tone of the混混 (hoodlums) seen, "Then who are you responsible to? Is it to yourself?" This tone was quite impolite.

"You could say that!" Hejian still held his temper, "Because I am ordered by the General Staff Headquarters, and the Kinoye Cabinet. As long as I am responsible to these two organizations and Prime Minister Konoye, that is enough. Others probably won't ask."

"Let me say this, Captain Inoue," Pingzi was always so gentle, "I will be responsible here. The captain can report back to your unit based on what I said."

"Ping...Bang, bang, bang..." The signal was sent for the second time. Judging from the sound of the guns, our team was very close. As soon as the signal was sent, suddenly signal guns were heard simultaneously from all directions. Before the signal gunshots ended, all kinds of gunshots rang out at the same time, rifles, submachine guns, and machine guns set up outside the door, all firing. The two sides had officially come into contact.

"Hey..." Hucheng didn't know what he had discovered, and suddenly shouted softly.

I just wanted to ask Hucheng, but it was too late. I saw the large light bulb suddenly go out. Inside the door, voices and gunshots were noisy, truly like a boiling cauldron, in a chaotic mess. Before my eyes was a pitch-black darkness. Not to mention "reaching out and not seeing five fingers," you couldn't even see your own hands. Standing here, I was as if I had lost my footing and fallen into a deep abyss.

"Miss Yaoxun! ...Hucheng!..." I shouted a few times, but there was no reply.

At the same time, I heard voices and gunshots mixed together, footsteps mixed with each other, and that fake female tiger, roaring loudly, like a wolf howling. The roar gradually went away, probably running outwards while roaring, and what she was roaring, I couldn't hear clearly.

Just as I was about to grope forward to find Hejian, suddenly a strong beam of light shot out from the corner of the big room, like a searchlight, sweeping horizontally, stopping beside me, and then suddenly went out.

"Secretary General!" A rough voice shouted from not far away.

Hearing this voice and the half-mountain, half-Japanese accent, I knew it was "04."

"Secretary General,... everyone is gone!... "Hearing the sound of this speaking, I knew that "04" was walking towards me.

"Did everyone go out to participate?" I asked "04" in the direction of his voice.

"I can't say... some went upstairs, some rushed out of the gate."

"Did you see our captain?" I was most concerned about Hejian, because his situation was too peculiar, too complicated; "And that Miss Pingzi?"

"Went upstairs," the fool answered.

"Miss... Miss Yaoxun and Hucheng?"

"Also went upstairs."

"What about their captain and the two guests?" This was referring to Mr. W, Mr. Dai, and Secretary Ma.

"Probably also went upstairs."

Getting these reports, knowing that they had all gone upstairs, I of course had no need to stand here. Outside the door was the firing line, probably stray bullets were flying around, and I also had no need to go out; besides, my eyesight was poor, so I might not be able to see anything. I decided to go upstairs too.

### Another Case of Collusion Between Officials and Merchants

— Changkong

Nowadays, everyone expresses dissatisfaction with the status quo, shaking their heads at everything, expressing helplessness and discouragement, as if all they see before them is a darkening mess.

For example, the thorough investigation of the Gold Tide case, as of the fourteenth, only revealed that participating in the Gold Tide malpractice was another old trick of "collusion between officials and merchants."

Previously, grain loans caused a storm due to collusion between officials and merchants, but now the Gold Tide case, which has caused Shanghai's prices to rise by 100 percent, is once again the work of "collusion between officials and merchants"!

Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren are both key members of government-run banks. They use their power to secretly sell and buy gold bars, manipulating the power of life and death of finance on the one hand, and disrupting finance by taking advantage of the gaps in their authority on the other. As Deputy Commander Yang of the Garrison Department said, Lin and Yang secretly colluded with merchants, privately exchanged benefits, used external organizations to manipulate gold, breathed through the same nostril as corrupt merchants, and manipulated things from above and below.

Now Zhan Liansheng, chairman of the Shanghai Gold Industry Association, has been arrested, but Lin and Yang are still out on bail. The Gold Tide case is now being strictly investigated by the highest authorities, and we also hope that Lin and Yang should be immediately sent to the judicial authorities for strict punishment.

American journalists often criticize China's bureaucratic politics, bureaucratic capital, and collusion between officials and merchants; and severely punishing the malfeasance in the Gold Tide case is enough to wash away the international community's perception of China's political status quo!

Look: isn't the Associated Press again harshly criticizing the privileges that bureaucratic capital has in Chinese commercial firms?

There is a Chinese saying that goes: "As long as you sit upright, you don't have to worry about the monk and nun sharing a bench!"

Whether people criticize our bureaucratic politics or bureaucratic capital, as long as the highest authorities are upright and impartial, and punish a few "officials and merchants" and "neither officials nor merchants" like Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren according to the law, not only can the rumors of international friends be quelled, but also the resentment of the people can be suppressed.

The myriad threads of Chinese politics can be summarized in this one point. We should quickly establish a legal system, not centered on people, and prevent those who wield great power from arbitrarily doing evil!

The participation of official members in the Gold Tide case is a prominent example.

### Darwin Guessed Right: Coral Reefs are Sunken Islands

— Yan Tong

Scientific progress can sometimes be surprisingly slow! Darwin had a theory 110 years ago that has only now been confirmed by the U.S. Navy.

In 1831, Darwin was just a young naturalist, sailing on the famous voyage of the Beagle. As he crossed the South Pacific, he was fascinated by the ring-shaped coral islands. He wondered: How could these saucer-shaped corals suddenly grow out of such a deep ocean? Why are they ring-shaped? How are they formed? Everyone knows that corals don't thrive more than a few (one = six feet) feet below the surface of the water, so the coral reef must not have grown up from the seabed. So Darwin concluded: coral reefs are caused by the sinking of islands. After sinking, the corals growing on the shore continued to grow, forming the atolls we see today.

This theory was widely accepted, but it was never proven until the U.S. Navy decided to test two atomic bombs on Bikini Atoll last year. Scientists used seismic methods to map the structure of the atoll, using 126 deep-water explosives to explode at various locations on the bottom of the atoll. During the explosion, sound waves passed through the coral and the material below. The more solid the material, the faster the sound waves passed through. By recording the order in which the various sound measuring instruments received the sound waves, scientists could estimate the density of each stage of the rock.

They found that above 2,000 feet below the surface, the coral reef was made of coral or similar material. Below that was a harder rock, probably volcanic ash from previous eruptions, or limestone of coral or other marine animals that had been compressed. At about 5,000 feet, they finally found what they were looking for: a buried mountain.

This may be the center of the volcano, a relic of erosion. The details can only be known by drilling. But in any case, the mountain is there, far below where the corals grow. Darwin guessed right on the deck of the sailing ship. (Translated from Time Magazine, January 13)

### Speaking of Sheng Lan and Zhenfei Listening to Pine

— Tingsong

"Gaining Triumph at the Rainbow Pass" is close to being a popular and excellent play. Ye Sheng Lan is the most outstanding in his role, while Jin Zhongren and Cheng Jixian are both elegant and refined, truly embodying the style of their predecessors, but it is a pity that only those who know can appreciate them. Jiang Shengren's "Miao Xiang" has also changed his profession. He has been acting with Wan Hua for the longest time, but recently, he has become famous for playing Yang Zongbao's tour of the camp in "Visiting Mother." Those who sing Xiaosheng (young male roles) nowadays all follow his style, which is strange. Sheng Lan is the pride of the Xiaosheng actors of recent times. He opens up a new record by having a Xiaosheng take on the main role. Chen Shengtai, Chu Yindu, and Xu Hecai are all rising stars. Yu Zhenfei is the son of the master of opera. He became a professional actor as a famous amateur, and he is determined to perform in operas. He is actually an indoor disciple of Jixian. However, Zhenfei is truly an unprecedented talent in Kun Opera. His voice and appearance are both beautiful. Even if Xiao Xiang were to rise from the underground, he would probably only be equal to him. It is a pity that elegant music is lost, and no one is able to match him. Even Mei and Cheng can only perform "Qi Shuang Hui" with him, which is a masterpiece of "chuichang" (blowing tunes). If it is a formal Kun Opera, such as "Stealing Poems" and "Qin Tiao," it can only be said that there are many women. Only in the new play "Chun香 Dream," is he delicate and well-suited to the role, and his movements are coordinated. He and Yushuang match each other, truly capturing the ethereal and vague atmosphere of a dream. It is truly a satisfying work. I admire his talent, and I lament his fate. The latter half of this article should not be included in the "Remembering the Past" record. However, because Xu and Yu are both from Wu (Jiangsu and Zhejiang), and because Xiao Xiang opened the stage, I cannot but make Zhenfei the last general, so that they can shine together, fully expressing the meaning of the beauty of Xiaosheng.

### Three Doctors in "Golden Stone Vow"

— Xun Jie

Doctor Tao Hua knows very well that Pan Li is a smart and self-respecting child with a promising future. At the same time, he also understands the love between him and his own daughter, but because his wife suffers from insanity, which has been passed down to his daughter and affected the development of his career, he does not want to see a promising young man embark on his own path. He does not want the seedlings he has cultivated to be harmed, and finally, in a struggle between reason and pain, he poisons his daughter, kills himself, and leaves all his property to Pan Li.

Doctor Gordon, for the sake of his daughter's love, harbors hatred for Derek's dissolute behavior. Finally, taking advantage of an opportunity, he amputates his unnecessary legs. He wants to turn this young man into a cripple both physically and mentally.

Pan Li studied medicine in Vienna and, after graduating, heard that a childhood friend had had his legs amputated. He rushed back to his hometown, not only giving his friend his own property, but also trying his best to heal him psychologically, so that he would not feel like a cripple. In the end, he succeeded.

Here we see the typical good and bad doctors.

Doctors are saviors who free people from the sea of ​​suffering. They undertake the holiest and most active work. They should discern what is the doctor's responsibility and what is true salvation and love for others. If they indulge their own selfish desires and vent their personal grievances, then this is the most despicable and shameful thing in the world.

In this dark society, who can guarantee that there are no doctors like Gordon?

### Literary Clouds

— Yong

The woodcut artist Liu Xian recently wrote a letter to a friend in Shanghai from Beiping, saying: "The literary and publishing scene in the Beiping-Tianjin area is very quiet. There is a sense of cold weather and people being lazy to start. Although it is now entering early spring, the north wind is still howling, and the land is still frozen."

The fourth volume, third issue of "Literary Spring and Autumn," edited by Fan Quan, titled "New Talent Recommendation Issue," has now been published, featuring eleven short stories by new writers. "Intermediate Generation" is particularly valued by critics.

Zhou Erfu is currently rewriting his play "Soldiers' Sons" after arriving in Hong Kong from Shanghai.

### Straining Every Nerve

— Meng Long

In today's society, although there is an item called "additional work without additional pay," whether it actually exists is unknown.

Based on what I have heard and seen, and what I have understood in my heart, I dare to say boldly: The vast majority of people take on "additional work" precisely for the sake of "additional pay." Because only by taking on additional work can they work from sunrise to sunset and still not rest. Only then can they support their parents and provide for their children without shame.

A friend who works in the "nightlife" industry has started taking on additional work this semester, becoming a professor at a certain university during the day. He is used to telling the truth, "My crashing through the doors of the university and sitting on a cold bench is only in the hope of receiving some daily necessities rations. Otherwise, I wouldn't be happy to strain every nerve!"

"Straining every nerve!" This is a heart-wrenching cry! His burden is heavy, and it is not difficult to imagine him trembling on the cliff of life. He knows that his academic ability is more than enough, but his physical strength may already be failing. However, he has no choice but to "crash in," working day and night like an ox or horse. He also knows clearly that in a few years, perhaps even his strong flesh will no longer exist, and he will not even be able to find the capital to struggle with sweat and effort. If he delays any longer, he will not even have the strength to "jump out" again. He must "crash in" in time, and he can no longer worry about anything else! However, after straining every nerve, who can give him life? This is why he trembles before life.

The philosopher Nietzsche said: Humans are no different from golden-haired beasts. The writer Mao Dun pointed out that Chinese people (referring to coolies) seem to be livestock carrying heavy loads. In the journey or adventure of life, I think everyone will inevitably "crash into" a place sooner or later. As for what place they crash into? I think it's nothing more than a pit.

That day, a friend and I went to see "Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon." What was frightening was that the shadow of the pit was inadvertently imprinted on our hearts. Regardless of whether we are higher than the protagonist in the play on the stage of life, the distance between each other and the pit is equally close. When the movie ended, he sighed deeply: traveling eight thousand miles only to discover a pit!

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Lao Zhu finally realized that someone was watching him, so he interrupted his speech and turned his face away.

"Ah! It's you?" He couldn't be as calm as that young woman. As soon as the other person's face came into view, he jumped up, widened his eyes, and exclaimed in surprise.

"It's me, that's right. Zhaonian," the young woman replied softly.

Xu Fatty glanced at them sideways.

"Lao Zhu, have you known each other for a long time? This is my cousin, she just came from Shanghai, and happened to encounter the escape," the host said as if introducing them.

Neither of the guests spoke.

The young woman deliberately turned around, walked to the window, sat on a small wooden chair, forced a very unnatural smile, in order to break the deadlock.

"Oh! You are relatives," Zhu Zhaonian said blankly. "I didn't see you when I came yesterday."

"They arrived last night. Thanks to you, Cousin!" Xu Shaoming was very happy to have this interlude, unexpectedly interrupting Lao Zhu's complaints. "They took a lot of detours, coming from the Pingshi side. Lao Zhu, my cousin is really capable, she even brought two children!"

"Two children? So, you already have children?" Zhu Zhaonian asked miserably, forgetting his concerns for a moment.

"It's been a full eleven years! How could there be no children?" Lan replied quickly, not giving Xu Shaoming a chance to notice the affectionate address that Lao Zhu used.

Xu Shaoming drank the glass of cold tea in front of him like a cow.

"Second Cousin, how do you know Lao Zhu?" he asked, looking puzzled.

"We met when we were running the Youth Drama Troupe," Zhu Zhaonian answered the question for the young woman.

"Oh! That's right, that's right! You had many girlfriends when you were in school!" Xu Shaoming vaguely remembered something. However, although he and Lao Zhu studied together, their interests were completely different, and they rarely interacted on weekdays, so he did not know the details.

"Why did you come in at this time, and why did you bring the children?" Lao Zhu could no longer put on a smiling face. "Are you still planning to live in Guilin? Where is your husband?"

The young woman slowly wiped the sweat from the tip of her nose with a small handkerchief, without answering immediately; her emotions were also greatly agitated. (15)
