[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The U.S. State Department announced today that 140 Japanese *Kaibōkan*-class warships will be immediately divided equally among the United States, China, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. This is the first distribution of 239 warships according to the Four-Nation Joint Declaration in Moscow in 1943 (the declaration stated: that all nations fighting a common enemy will act in concert on all issues regarding the enemy's surrender and disarmament, and agreed that after Japan's surrender, all Japanese naval submarines and surface warships larger than destroyers will be destroyed, while destroyers and smaller surface combat vessels will be divided equally among the four powers). According to the declaration, all Japanese warships of destroyer tonnage and above are currently being dismantled by the U.S. occupation forces. The distribution of this batch of destroyers will be decided by representatives through consultation. The United States requires each recipient country to designate a port in the Far East for delivery. The required expenses will be borne by each recipient country, and the handover will be completed within 30 days. The 239 warships include 27 destroyers, 76 escort ships, 5 cruisers, 18 light patrol ships, 62 submarine auxiliary destroyers, 11 minelayers, 14 minesweepers, 4 cargo ships, 12 transport ships, 9 aviation rescue ships, and a sundry ship. The first batch of 48 ships can also be distributed soon. Furthermore, the ships delivered to the four countries will be disarmed first, according to the agreement of the four countries.

### Far Eastern Commission Subcommittees Begin Discussing U.S. Proposals; Final Decision on Japanese Reparations to be Made

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] The Far Eastern Commission began discussing U.S. proposals today to make a final decision on Japan's post-war industrial level and Japanese reparations. Currently, discussions are limited to subcommittees. Once the subcommittee work is completed, a plenary session will be convened. The plenary session is currently scheduled for next Thursday, but there are signs that it may be held earlier. Delegations from the eleven countries remain silent about the U.S. proposals, generally awaiting instructions from their governments. Meanwhile, Harrison, director of the Reparations Affairs Office of MacArthur Headquarters, and Leidt, director of the Industrial Office, arrived here today from Tokyo to discuss reparations issues with the Army authorities. The nature of the discussions is unknown, but it is said to be related to the U.S. actions in the Far Eastern Commission today. Another official at MacArthur Headquarters said here that the reparations issue is expected to be resolved quickly. This issue is not as important as restoring Japan's industrial health, which is the headquarters' focus.

### Executive Yuan Allocates Huge Sum to Aid Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Regarding the relief of the disaster-stricken overseas Chinese in Palembang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to allocate CN¥648 million, equivalent to 180,000 Dutch guilders, to be remitted to East Indies for relief purposes.

### Greening of Zhangjiakou Project Begins

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 12th] The project to green Zhangjiakou City and transform it into a modern city outside the Great Wall has now begun. A large number of laborers are working daily, earning 7,000 yuan a day as work-for-relief.

Currently, only projects that do not require materials, such as digging ditches and building dikes, are being carried out.

### Siam Immigration Law Postponed; Ambassador Li Requests Increase in Our Immigration Quota

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 11th Dispatch] It is confirmed that the Siamese government's quota immigration method, originally scheduled to take effect on April 1, has been temporarily postponed after our ambassador to Siam, Li Tieh-cheng, requested the Siamese government to reconsider the allocation of quotas for Chinese immigrants and the date of implementation. According to Ambassador Li, the quota of 10,000 Chinese immigrants per year is based on statistics from the past 20 years, which is unfair, as the number of Chinese immigrants in the latter half of the 20 years was insignificant due to the Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast. Under normal circumstances between 1927 and 1937, the average was 18,000 people per year. This number would be reasonable as the annual quota for Chinese immigrants to Siam. It is reported that in addition to requesting an increase in the quota, Ambassador Li also suggested extending the date of implementation, as the immediate implementation of the new method would cause great difficulties for those already en route to Siam.

### Ministry of Social Affairs Designates 30 Cities to Evaluate Wages

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Since the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures, regarding the wage portion, in addition to the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, which have been designated by the Executive Yuan as places for strict price controls, all workers' wages calculated according to the cost of living index are restricted to the cost of living index of January of this year as the highest index, and factories quantitatively distribute six kinds of goods in kind, including grain, cloth, fuel, oil, salt, and sugar, compensating for the difference between the price in January of this year and the current month's price. For other important places where goods in kind have not been distributed, the implementation methods for evaluating wages have been announced and implemented by the Executive Yuan. The locations for evaluating wages have been designated by the Ministry of Social Affairs and presented to the Executive Yuan as 30 cities, including Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wuhu, Anqing, Guangzhou, Shantou, Guilin, Wuzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kangding, Guiyang, Kunming, Changsha, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Beiping, and they are ordered to establish wage evaluation committees separately to consider the price of major daily necessities at that time and place (rice, coal, oil, salt, cotton, cloth, sugar) to make evaluations on wage increases or decreases. If a labor-management dispute evaluation committee has been established in the above locations, the task of wage evaluation will be concurrently handled by the committee, without the need to establish a separate organization to avoid duplication. As for the industries in Nanjing and Shanghai that do not calculate wages according to the cost of living index and do not have factories that can distribute goods in kind, when there is a need to evaluate wages, the labor-management dispute evaluation committee of each city will refer to the implementation methods for evaluating wages to make evaluations.

### Guangdong Undertakes Economic Construction; Uses Overseas Chinese and Foreign Capital to Implement Five-Year Plan; Gives Priority to Farmland Water Conservancy to Increase Grain Production

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 12th] Governor Luo Zhuoying of Guangdong recently told reporters that Guangdong's Five-Year Construction Plan has now been implemented, but funding is a problem and overseas Chinese and foreign capital should be used as much as possible for development. When he was in Nanjing, he consulted with various Chinese and foreign people, who were very willing to assist in the implementation. Currently, the American Pan-Asia Corporation, which intends to invest in Guangdong's construction, and its person in charge are meeting in Shanghai. The plan has been instructed by the central government, that as long as there is no conflict with local industry and commerce, a contract can be signed in accordance with the Company Law. Luo continued to say that Guangdong will be an economic center rather than a political center in the future, that everything will be done in accordance with central laws and regulations, focusing on economic construction, and that the government will do its utmost to solve the urgent needs of the people. Therefore, in the grain-deficient province, the primary focus is on farmland water conservancy construction to increase production. According to the current plan, grain production in the province can be increased by one-fifth in three years and one-quarter in five years. In addition, the province has rapidly restored the education system, which has been commended by the central government. Currently, the movement to expand the promotion of the national language is being carried out, and it is estimated that it will be universal within three years.

### An Impressionistic Record of Northern Jiangsu (1) Two Worlds: Inside and Outside the City

— Reporter Zhang Shengzhi

Northern Jiangsu, this vast plain, is still filled with the smell of gunpowder and blood. The people are living in dire straits, their lives only marginally better than pigs'. Those who are alive are being tormented beyond endurance in the cracks. It is difficult to find even a trace of a smile on anyone's face here. Even a small child's expression is so serious, an unnatural phenomenon that makes them seem ten years older.

As we set foot on the highways of Northern Jiangsu, the first thing that catches our eyes is a series of circular pillboxes. The construction materials for these many structures were all dismantled and moved from the destroyed homes of the people.

Around Dongtai, there is also a "new Great Wall" stretching seven li in length. The foundation, two or three zhang thick, appears quite solid. On the one hand, this can be said to represent the crystallization of military-civilian cooperation. But on the other hand, it is also sufficient to indicate that, aside from some points and lines, it is still difficult to achieve true pacification in Northern Jiangsu.

In any county town in Northern Jiangsu, although there is an atmosphere of peace and prosperity, as you approach the city gate, you seem to fall into another world. Layers of barbed wire, the front filled with fortifications, and soldiers with live ammunition, in twos and threes, guarding the pillboxes. This scene is so desolate and tense, so absolutely incompatible with what you saw in the city just moments before. What you see before you is only a stretch of azure sky, set against a pile of gray rubble. The pleasant mood from just a moment ago will immediately be washed away completely!

I remember that on the day we arrived in Rugao, the common people swept the streets clean to welcome the press corps. But we heard that when it was recovered last year, the countryside outside the city was littered with corpses, and even three months later, the stench was still unbearable. These terrifying phenomena are still deeply engraved in everyone's minds and cannot be swept away.

By chance, we managed to steal an hour of free time from a series of visits and receptions to sneak out of the city to take a look. Here, without exception, pillboxes and barbed wire became the only decorative items. We chatted with the daughter of a store owner in a small grocery store by the roadside. This dramatically small shop was also a "three-dynasty veteran." We talked about puppet currency, then anti-Japanese currency, and then national currency. With such repeated exchanges, this grocery store, which was originally quite large, has become a small cigarette and paper shop. The store owner's daughter was originally a student at Rugao Girls' High School. Because she had received secondary education, on the one hand, we could communicate clearly, and on the other hand, her perspective could be more profound. So we talked more and more vigorously. She said with a wry smile, "The burning and killing in the war are certainly the direct disasters suffered by the common people, but the repeated changes in the currency system are the fatal blow to the vast majority of the people." She also said, "The purchasing power of the people is so pitifully weak now. Take my small shop as an example. With a turnover of ten thousand yuan a day, the money earned is not even enough to eat porridge." Coincidentally, across the street was a pork shop. Because Rugao is a place that produces pigs, the price was relatively cheap, with the market price being 2,800 yuan per catty that day. I asked her if they could eat meat every day. She smiled, her face blushing, and said, "How could we? It's hanging in front of our eyes, not in our mouths!"

We ended our conversation amid her bitter laughter. When we stepped out of her shop, we both had heavy hearts.

At a small street corner, we saw another common person from the countryside being stopped by a checkpoint. He took out a temporary pass from a tattered cotton-padded coat, with a two-and-a-half-inch headshot pasted on it. Of course, there was nothing wrong with it, but that photo was definitely not as "sweet" as those displayed in the windows of Shanghai photo studios, but rather a mournful face, a dull head. Below the pass was the signature of a township chief, with the effective period written above, for only three days.

The checkpoint was staffed by a police officer, a soldier, and a female inspector. They inspected the passing villagers and townspeople in a tripartite manner, feeling the upper body and pinching the lower body, working very carefully.

In the countryside here, we rarely see a dog. Some say the dogs have been eaten by people. But some believe the dogs have all starved to death.

A farmer told me that he tilled three mu of land for others in the suburbs. For a family of five, what they harvested was not enough to eat. Usually, they relied entirely on carrying manure for others to earn some money to barely make a living. I asked him: Are the taxes in the countryside high? He said helplessly, it's not fixed, it depends on the township chief.

When we returned to the city, someone advised us not to run around outside the city. The reason is that there is no "peace and tranquility" here.

The darkness of night brought an even greater sense of terror. The city had no electricity after nine o'clock, the streets were under curfew, and sentries were loudly demanding "passwords" from a distance. Bayonets were mounted on rifles, hiding in dark corners, startling people. Fortunately, the people in the city were used to it. If nothing happened, they closed their doors at six o'clock and went to bed early, leaving behind only a city as dead as death.

Editorial

### On Sino-American Relations

Yesterday was the second anniversary of the death of former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Seeing the divided opinions at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, and hearing the speech delivered by former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace in London, all the more made us mourn the death of this great international political diplomat. We dare to boldly assume that if this great leader were still alive, using his wisdom as a political diplomat, and working with political diplomats from other countries to jointly create a lasting peace in the post-war world, it would not have led to the current tense situation. Therefore, President Roosevelt's passing was not only a great loss for the United States, but also a great loss for the entire world. Looking back and looking forward, it is not difficult to prove that today's world particularly needs a great figure like President Roosevelt to come out and lead the world, so that the post-war world, riddled with holes and sores, can embark on the path of peace and prosperity.

It is undeniable that today's world not only has little hope of entering a new era of peace and democracy, but the entire world is in a tense situation; the crisis of a new war is lurking everywhere, with the possibility of breaking out anytime, anywhere. We make this statement not to deliberately spread alarmist rumors, but our true intention is to awaken the attention of the political diplomats of the great powers from the standpoint of a third party, and to use their political wisdom at any time to turn the tide before it is too late. But how can this current world crisis be overcome? As the saying goes, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom, there can of course be many different methods; different paths lead to the same goal, to achieve the same purpose. We will leave aside all other methods and claims for the time being, and first make a fair comment on the statements and claims made by Henry Wallace since his resignation.

Wallace's claim of "One World" and his strong statement that the United States and the Soviet Union must cooperate fully are in principle unanimously agreed by peace-loving people in all countries, especially Wallace's speech in London the day before yesterday, saying that "if the United States cannot reach an understanding with the Soviet Union, then a third world war will be inevitable," is even more to the point. Not only do we completely agree, but the U.S. diplomatic authorities also hold this view. Looking at American diplomacy in the past year, it can be said that it has always sought the understanding of the Soviet Union. Britain has tried every means to conclude an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union, which is even more obvious; but this appeasement policy of blindly pleasing the Soviet Union has not only failed to promote diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain, but the mutual suspicion and fear between the two sides has intensified, resulting in the current deadlock that cannot be broken. Therefore, Wallace's claim is not a question of "yes" or "no" in theory, but a question of whether it can be done in reality. For example, Wallace said: "Since President Roosevelt's death, the United States has lost its qualification for leadership, so some countries in Eastern Europe have taken actions to split the world into two worlds, which was supported by the Soviet Union. This is an obvious fact. The U.S. government not only did not make doubled efforts to maintain the unity of the world, but allowed it to split, and thought that war was inevitable." From this general conversation, it can also be seen the reasons for the world's division into two worlds today: first, Roosevelt's death caused the United States to lose its leadership qualification in the international arena; second, the Soviet Union supported the separatist actions of Eastern European countries; and third, the United States failed to make doubled efforts to maintain one world. From this, it can be seen that Wallace's one-sided attack on the U.S. government's foreign policy cannot be considered to have sufficient reasons, and can only be regarded as a kind of fault-finding by a frustrated politician against the government.

Standing on the standpoint of a third party, and calmly observing the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union since the end of the war, the most important reason why it has presented a situation of being close and estranged is that there are two decisive forces, which are evenly matched, but sometimes fluctuate up and down. After the war, the United States and the Soviet Union, having learned the bloody lesson of the last war, both deeply knew the horror of war. Especially in the age of atomic energy, if another war breaks out, mankind will only destroy itself, so they felt that peace was particularly lovely. Therefore, everyone's desire for peace is the centripetal force that leads the United States and the Soviet Union to "unite" after the war. However, the United States and the Soviet Union are two completely different types in terms of ideology, and in terms of practical interests, they are in an incompatible position. For any international issue that arises after the war, the interests of the United States and the Soviet Union are always diametrically opposed, and they cannot be compromised or reconciled. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union, whether in Europe or in the Far East and the Pacific, have friction everywhere. Therefore, ideological differences and conflicting interests are the centrifugal force that leads the United States and the Soviet Union to "separate." The ebb and flow of these two forces form the close and estranged relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, which also creates the uncertainty of the world situation.

Precisely because the United States and the Soviet Union still have common ground, everyone desires peace. The Soviet Union requires engaging in material construction in a peaceful atmosphere, enriching the socialist country, so that it can truly guarantee its survival and not worry about foreign aggression. The United States also wants the world to recuperate in a peaceful environment, creating universal peace and prosperity, so that the United States' industry and commerce can have a way out. So that the United States, at any cost, can obtain some compensation for participating in this war. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union, despite their different ideologies and conflicting interests, will eventually find ways to cooperate and jointly maintain world peace, so that both countries can benefit. It has not been two years since the end of the war, and in this short period of time, I don't know how many international conferences have been held. Taking the current Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference as an example, from beginning to end, the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union have been contradictory. Why did Molotov and Marshall engage in a tireless war of words, and have such good patience? Everyone still wants to discuss a compromise solution. Otherwise, they would have broken up unhappily long ago. Therefore, the reason why the United States and the Soviet Union still maintain normal relations and have not fallen into a split is also here. However, we cannot overestimate this centripetal force, otherwise we will make the mistake of being overly optimistic. Moreover, the centrifugal forces created by various factors cannot be ignored.

The first is the difference in ideology. The United States is a capitalist country, and the Soviet Union is a communist country. Not only are they ideologically opposed to each other, but they also have different views on any term. For example, the peace and democracy that the United States and the Soviet Union jointly desire are also viewed differently. The world peace that the Soviet Union desires is a world peace under the leadership of the Soviet Union. Similarly, the peace that the United States desires is also a world peace under the leadership of the United States. Moreover, the methods adopted by both sides are different. The Soviet Union wants to consolidate the world peace it leads by expanding its "security zone," while the United States relies on the secret of atomic energy, world bases, and the power of dollar diplomacy to maintain world peace. As for the American and Soviet conceptions of democracy, they are even more different. The Soviet Union once criticized British and American-style democracy as 18th-century democracy, while the British and Americans called Soviet-style democracy totalitarianism.

The second is the conflict of interests. Although the United States and the Soviet Union generally have the same opinions on any issue in principle, conflicts occur everywhere in actual interests. Whether it is dealing with Germany or controlling Japan, although there is no objection in principle, the opinions are very different on the implementation methods. The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was deadlocked for this reason.

The third is suspicion and fear. The United States suspects that the Soviet Union is expanding its power everywhere and establishing an "iron curtain," destroying the American so-called principles of freedom and democracy; while the Soviet Union suspects the United States, which is unwilling to announce the secret of atomic energy, and is exercising its dollar diplomacy everywhere, and all the economic aid to anti-Soviet countries is a threat to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the two sides are suspicious of each other, and the fear is intensifying, making it impossible to eliminate.

From the above, it can be seen that the centrifugal force between the United States and the Soviet Union is growing day by day. If today's international political diplomats cannot use their wisdom in time to turn the tide before it is too late, then the future consequences will be unimaginable. We certainly hope that American political diplomats will use their wisdom to restore the spirit of mutual trust and concession between the United States and the Soviet Union; however, the elimination of suspicion and fear cannot be eliminated by the vigilance of one side; if the Soviet Union's attitude cannot be changed, Wallace's proposal, no matter how ideal it is, is still a kind of impractical empty talk with little possibility of realization. Therefore, we want to loudly appeal to the political diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union: Use political wisdom to eliminate misunderstandings between the two countries, now is the time.

### All Circles in Xinjiang Raise Demands to Improve Transportation Between Beijing and Dihua Zhang Zhizhong Promises to Convey to the Executive Yuan

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 12th] What bothers all levels of staff serving in Xinjiang the most is the obstruction of transportation between the Northwest and Beijing. It takes months for letters to travel back and forth. The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) planes flying between Beijing and Dihua have recently suspended service for reasons, while Northeast Airlines and the China-Philippines and China-Thailand air routes have been planned and opened one after another, giving the people of Xinjiang a very poor impression. It is reported that people from all walks of life here have asked Zhang Zhizhong to resolve the following issues: (1) It was previously reported that the Shanghai-Xinjiang route would add eight flights per month, which was approved by Chairman Chiang and ordered by the Ministry of Communications to be handled by CNAC. Why has it not been implemented yet? How can state-owned transportation agencies break faith with the people? (2) The opening of the China-Philippines and China-Thailand air routes is because they are international transportation routes, but how can the country value foreigners over its own people and ignore the demands of the people in the border areas? (3) The opening of the China-Philippines and China-Thailand routes is obviously because they are profitable, while the Shanghai-Dihua route requires losses. State-owned agencies should benefit the people. How can they ignore it if it is not profitable? This is certainly not the intention of the central government. Although Xinjiang is a remote province, it is part of Chinese territory. The country's transportation policy should seek balanced development. It is heard that Zhang has promised to convey the requests to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications for answers.

### Soviet Foreign Minister Formally Proposes Four-Power Co-Management of the Ruhr Area Unwilling to Decide on the Saar Issue Immediately Heated Debate on the Issue of Territorial Merger

[This newspaper] Moscow, 12th [broadcast]: Today, the Foreign Ministers Conference completed its discussion on the future political structure of Germany.

[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] Molotov opposed the French proposal to separate the Ruhr and Rhineland regions from Germany at today's Foreign Ministers Conference. He said that the goal of the proposal was to decompose and liquidate the German state, which the Soviet government found difficult to agree to. The German people should not be deprived of their country, as this move would drive the German people to become enemies and throw themselves into the arms of "avengers and militarists." He believes that four-power control of the Ruhr area during the occupation period is indispensable for European security. Regarding the French request to merge the Saar into the French economy, Molotov stated that it still needs further study. Molotov then criticized the merger of the British and American zones of Germany, saying that as a result of the merger, the Ruhr area had been controlled by the two allied countries, but the Soviet Union and France were still not involved, which was an extremely abnormal arrangement. After the British and Americans merged their two occupation zones, they effectively divided Germany into eastern and western parts and began to decompose Germany, thus destroying the political and economic unity of Germany. The Ruhr must be placed under four-power co-management in order to serve the interests of Europe, as Marshall and Bevin claimed yesterday. Regarding the Allied countries' other land claims against Germany, Molotov said that he had not had time to study them one by one, so he was not prepared to offer opinions for the time being. Secretary of State Marshall stood up to respond to Molotov immediately after he finished speaking, stating that he could not accept Molotov's conclusion on the merger of the British and American zones. He stated that the merger of the British and American zones was forced by the failure to implement the Potsdam Agreement. The United States sincerely hoped to implement the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement regarding the economic unity of Germany, so that the Ruhr area and the rest of Germany could be automatically co-managed by the four powers. Bevin also said that Britain was trying to implement the various provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, but due to the opposition of the eastern region of Germany, the Allied Control Council was unable to act in the spirit of Potsdam. Bevin then mentioned the distribution of coal and steel produced in the Ruhr, saying that the steel and coal in the Ruhr were originally distributed to the four zones by the Allied Control Council, but since the Soviet representative in the Allied Control Council stated that the coal produced in the Soviet zone must be supplied to the zone and the Soviet authorities first, and the surplus could be distributed to the four powers, Britain stopped distributing the Ruhr coal to the four countries. Later, other products in the Soviet zone, especially food, were handled in the same way as the Soviet representative stated, so the western region of Germany had to take the same steps.

Soviet Union Emphasizes the Issue of Reparations

[This newspaper] Moscow, 12th [broadcast]: The Soviet representative held the first Soviet press conference today at the Foreign Ministers Conference since it opened in the Soviet capital. According to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, if the Soviet Union cannot obtain compensation from current German production, it will never accept any overall treaty. He emphasized that a treaty without reparations is equivalent to a person lacking a heart. If the issue of reparations is not agreed upon, it will inevitably increase the difficulties between the Western powers and the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 12th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic visited U.S. Secretary of State Marshall today. It is believed that Simic made demands for the cession of Carinthia province and compensation from Austria.

### The Only Achievement of the Foreign Ministers Conference Reveals Some Secret Agreements

[This newspaper] Moscow, 12th [broadcast]: The Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference concluded five weeks of debate today. Starting next week, it will enter its sixth week. The only achievement of the Foreign Ministers Conference in the past five weeks was the revelation of some secret agreements. Secret clauses such as Yalta were mentioned every day in the five weeks. As a result, the U.S. government had to publish the correct content of some secret clauses. So far, the following have been revealed: (1) In the secret Yalta clauses, Roosevelt and Churchill both agreed to obtain compensation from current German production; (2) In the secret Potsdam Agreement, Attlee and Stalin agreed not to obtain compensation from Austria; (3) Bevin, Byrnes, and Stalin made some decisions on the German-Polish border issue in secret talks in Potsdam. The British and Americans now claim that the borders decided at that time were only temporary, while the Soviets insist that they were permanent; (4) President Roosevelt advocated dividing Germany into five states at the Tehran Conference, but Churchill advocated dividing it into three states at the Moscow Conference.

### Ma Qing Clarifies America's Policy Towards Korea; Hodge Resolves to Implement It; Promoting the Resumption of US-Soviet Joint Commission Negotiations
   [Asia East News Agency, Seoul, 12th] Lieutenant General Hodge, through the Press Office, issued the following statement regarding Secretary of State Marshall's two communications to Molotov:

Secretary of State Marshall's letter to the Soviet Foreign Minister expresses the United States' attitude toward Korea and the implementation of the decisions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference, and urges the reopening of the US-Soviet Joint Commission. If the Soviet Union does not accept the recommendations put forward in Secretary of State Marshall's two communications, the United States will establish a provisional government in its occupation zone to assist Korea in resolving its various difficulties. In other words, the American military in southern Korea will independently promote the upward development of South Korea's politics, economy, and culture, and strive for the development of democracy.

Families of the "Fu Bo" Warship Officers and Men Appeal
   Demanding Punishment of the Culprits, Compensation, and Bereavement Benefits
   If a Concrete Response Is Not Received, They Will Jointly Petition in Nanjing

The China Merchants Bureau's Request to Release Dai Rulin Is Rejected
   [Our Newspaper's Report] The Liaison Committee of the families of the officers and men who died in the "Fu Bo" warship disaster yesterday afternoon hosted the press to appeal, believing that the captain of the Hai Min transport ship, Ru Lin, did not immediately stop the ship to rescue after the accident, but instead attempted to escape, which is tantamount to intentional homicide, and has violated Article 128 of the Maritime Law and Item 1 of Article 271 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, they appeal to the public to uphold justice and provide support. The committee also stated that it has put forward three demands: "(1) Punish the Culprits: Dai Ru Lin's failure to rescue is unforgivable. The Hai Min ship continued to sail and attempted to escape after colliding with and sinking the "Fu Bo" warship. This is confirmed by the passengers of the ship, and the fact that only one of the hundreds of officers and men on the Fu Bo ship was rescued also proves this. The judicial authorities should impose the death penalty to uphold the law and appease public anger. (2) Compensation: The officers and men of the Fu Bo who died in the line of duty were cultivated by the country in difficult times and were the support of our families. We are heartbroken after the tragedy, but the China Merchants Bureau, from the standpoint of the perpetrator, has not made any expression. Moreover, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, Xu Xueyu, was leisurely sightseeing in West Lake while we were running around and wailing, disregarding the lives of hundreds of people. This is the ultimate disregard for humanity. Now that our families, orphans, and widows are in dire straits, the China Merchants Bureau, as the perpetrator, should immediately bear the responsibility for compensation. (3) Bereavement Benefits: Our Fu Bo warship officers and men died in the line of duty. In addition to sending personnel to comfort the families, the Naval Headquarters has not yet clarified the steps for handling bereavement benefits. However, in view of the cumbersome nature of general bereavement procedures and the delay in time, the naval authorities should expedite the preferential treatment and not be perfunctory."

Liaison Committee representative Yu Yiping and others also stated: If a concrete response is not received in the short term, they will take joint action and petition the relevant parties in Nanjing.

   [Another Report] Deputy Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters, Gao Rufeng, stated that Dai Rulin, the captain of the Hai Min ship that collided with and sank the Fu Bo gunboat, has been detained by the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office and will be investigated according to law. He urged all family members of the victims in various places to quickly contact the First Department of the Nanjing Naval Headquarters in writing at their respective locations to apply for bereavement benefits, so as not to travel back and forth to Shanghai and waste money.

   [Another Report] Wang Ruiqing and 21 other members of the Liaison Committee organized by the families of the officers and men who died in the Fu Bo tragedy yesterday jointly submitted a request to the District Prosecutor's Office to strictly investigate Dai Rulin, the captain of the Hai Min ship, and requested continued detention and no bail, so as not to increase the difficulties during the investigation. At the same time, Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, also submitted a document requesting the release of Dai Rulin on bail. The handling prosecutor, Cao Hong, reviewed and rejected Xu Xueyu's request.

Opposing the Railway Bureau's Freight Business Office; Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Transportation Industry Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures
   Passing a Resolution to Organize a Joint Business Promotion Association
   [Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Transportation Business Association yesterday afternoon convened a joint meeting in the auditorium of the Shanghai Forwarding Industry Association. Chairman Guo Shaohou reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that since the Railway Bureau established freight business offices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou last year, the transportation industry's business has been taken away.

Suspicion of Malpractice in the Sale of Cotton Cloth at Auction
   Concluding Arguments; Sentencing Scheduled
   [Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Pan Shufan, former deputy director of the Municipal Government Property Management Office, Xu Jingbo, chairman of the Welfare Committee of the Municipal Police Bureau, and Liao Gongshao, director of the General Affairs Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, being suspected of engaging in private malpractice during the sale of cotton cloth at auction, which was secretly ordered by Chairman Jiang to be thoroughly investigated, was heard for the third time yesterday in the District Court. Pan testified: Since taking office as deputy director of the Property Management Office, everything has been handled under orders, and there has never been any malpractice. Xu Jingbo and Liao Gongshao also stated that they did not consider the repurchase of cotton cloth to be an act of malpractice, but purely to raise funds for the welfare of the police, and not for personal gain. They also stated that at that time, they repurchased 1,000 pieces from the winning business, Rongmao, at a price of 50,000 yuan per piece, and the payment for the cloth was made by the accounting office of the Municipal Police Bureau with a check and approved by Deputy Director Yu. The court also summoned Zheng Jing, the director of the accounting office of the Police Bureau, to testify, proving that the payment for the cloth was indeed paid by the accounting office with a check. Li Guangzhong, the person in charge of Rongmao, was also questioned, and he testified that he did not know any of the defendants Pan, Xu, and Liao. He went to bid because he saw the bidding announcement of the Property Management Office. There was no private malpractice during the bidding, and he requested an investigation. After the defense lawyers for the defendants presented their arguments, the court ordered that the sentencing be announced on the 18th, and the three defendants each remained on their original bail.

Change of General Manager of the Executive Yuan Water Transport Team
   After the Executive Yuan Water Transport Team was entrusted to the Jin Yun Office for agency management, the Jin Yun Office hired Huang Jiaqiu as the general manager. Recently, due to Huang's repeated apologies and resignations, the Executive Yuan appointed Colonel Annas, the executive director of the department, as the general manager the day before yesterday, and Huang served as a consultant. Annas officially took office yesterday. The Water Transport Team currently has a total of 263 ships, transporting repair equipment and other items, with a total value of more than 19 million US dollars. Among them, 81 ships are worth more than 50,000 US dollars each. The ownership of these ships still belongs to UNRRA, and the Executive Yuan is only borrowing them. Therefore, the final disposal of these ships is still subject to UNRRA's decision. The Executive Yuan hopes that UNRRA can donate these ships to our country and sell them to shipping companies at a price to develop the shipping industry. The number of ships allocated to the Water Transport Team by UNRRA has reached 95% of the total, and the remaining 5% are barges, which are on their way to China.

   In addition, the Water Transport Team has been established for nearly a year. According to statistics, it has carried out approximately 200,000 tons of materials before and after. The amount of materials transported last month was particularly large, totaling more than 27,000 tons.

The Only Son of the British Prime Minister, Little Attlee, Is in Shanghai
   Without Enjoying Any Nobility or Privilege, He Works as an Apprentice Sailor on a Transport Ship
   [Our Newspaper's Special Feature] Martin Attlee, 19, the only son of current British Prime Minister Attlee, works as a basic apprentice sailor on the Blue Funnel Line's Calchas. The Calchas set sail from Liverpool in early February to China and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. This is Little Attlee's first visit to Shanghai.

   In Britain, the son of the Prime Minister, like the son of a worker, is an ordinary citizen on an equal footing. Little Attlee did not enjoy any privileges because his father was the Prime Minister, and he is not interested in his father's career. His ambition lies in the vast and great ocean. Therefore, after graduating from a regular school, he specialized in navigation and worked on several ships in Canada. This time, he came to China with the Calchas, and his job is to wash and sweep the deck.

   Yesterday, the reporter specifically crossed the Huangpu River from Yangshupu to visit this "Prime Minister's Son" sailor. Walking windingly from the Blue Funnel Wharf onto the ship, I saw the crew members working busily, and I didn't know which one was Little Attlee. After repeatedly inquiring, thanks to a familiar sailor, he led us to Little Attlee's bedroom, but he was not there. With great difficulty, we searched around the deck again and saw a person walking from the stern in the distance. The sailor who led us to find him pointed and said, "He's coming."

   Covered in Grease and Dirt
   Looking Like a Blacksmith's Apprentice
   Little Attlee, to put it bluntly, looks exactly like an apprentice just out of a blacksmith shop or a worker out of a machine room. He wears a blue-edged white-topped peaked cap, a gray work suit, bare feet in sandals, and is covered in grease and dirt. He holds a broken straw rope in one hand and a cigarette in the other, tall and leisurely, probably just finished work.

   A Shy Lad
   After hearing us express our intentions, he looked quite shy. He said that he was going ashore to play football at four o'clock, so he could only talk for a few minutes. (It was almost four o'clock.) He told us that there were three sisters at home. He has been interested in sailing since he was a child, and his father, Prime Minister Attlee, also agreed to his participation in shipboard work. After coming to Shanghai this time, he has not yet visited the city, and the Calchas is leaving Shanghai on Monday, and the only remaining day, Sunday, happens to be his shift, so he is about to miss the opportunity to visit Shanghai. He looked quite regretful.

   Deeply Touched by a Pair of Hands
   Little Attlee spoke very gently and kindly. We took a picture of him on the deck (see picture). He put his hands on his waist and looked very happy. I think he is very satisfied with his work.

   At four o'clock, I reached out to shake hands with him, but he pulled his hand back and opened his rough palm to show me. He said, "Too dirty." Indeed, the palm was full of black filth - the sacred achievement of work. This is a typical sailor's palm, and also a noble Prime Minister's son's palm. I was deeply moved. On the way home, I kept thinking about the sons of those dignitaries in our country.

Conscription Survey Can Begin on the 20th
   Civil Affairs Office Completes New Military Section Organization
   Candidates for the Heads of the Security Divisions in Each District to Be Announced
   In order to assist in handling conscription in the city, the Municipal Civil Affairs Office has added a military section to preside over the planning of the conscription survey. Yesterday, Yao Wenying, the chief of the section, said that since being ordered to take office, the internal organization has been completed, and three divisions have been set up for security, training, and conscription. The conscription survey will begin on the 20th of this month because the various forms are not yet printed. In the initial stage, the conscription of those aged 22 to 25 will be surveyed first according to the central government's regulations, and a list will be re-prepared based on the registered household in the city. The district offices have decided to add security divisions to preside over the handling of conscription. One director will be appointed for each of the 30 districts in the city. The candidates for director have been recommended by various floors, and all will be announced next week. Each bao in the city will have a bao squad leader (i.e., assistant), and these talents must have military knowledge and have served in the military. The section has also begun to register them, and many are being recommended by various military agencies, reaching more than 600 people. Among them are 300 youth army soldiers who can be fully employed.

China Merchants Bureau Can Afford to Compensate for Transportation of Japanese Reparations Materials
   [Our Newspaper's Report] The reporter recently inquired with Shen, deputy manager of the China Merchants Bureau, about the preparations for transporting the first batch of 400,000 tons of materials from Japan as reparations to our country. The bureau has not yet received an order from the Ministry of Communications. He said: 400,000 tons is a small amount, and the bureau's existing ships are sufficient to meet this need at any time. Shen pointed out that the primary work of receiving reparations materials includes dismantling, hoisting, and packaging, which must be fully prepared in advance, and transportation is secondary.

   According to officials, all kinds of workers needed to receive reparations materials in Japan in the future can be hired locally in Japan, and there is no need to hire workers in the country to transport them to Japan, saving labor and expenses.

   Preparations to Receive Reparations Ships
   [Our Newspaper's Report] The Naval Headquarters has been ordered by the Ministry of National Defense to send personnel to Japan to receive reparations ships. Relevant preparations are currently underway, and Ma Dejian, the chief engineer, and Yao Yu, the head of the port affairs section of the Shanghai Naval First Base Command, are scheduled to go to Japan in the near future to prepare for receiving the ships. The Chinese delegation to Japan will also send personnel to assist. However, the tonnage and performance of the ships to be received have not yet been clearly instructed by the Naval Headquarters to the naval base command here.

More Than 30 Incense Shops Are on Strike
   Many Disputes in Various Industries Due to Refusal to Issue Differential Allowances
   [Our Newspaper's Report] More than 30 incense shops, including Yongxinzai and Jinhuazhai, have been on strike since the 7th due to the differential allowance issue. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the employers to issue the differential allowance and ordered the employees to resume work immediately.

   [Another Report] Since the freeze on the cost of living index, the government has stipulated that differential allowances be issued to subsidize employees.

Texaco Oil Company Dismisses a Large Number of Workers
   Social Affairs Bureau Listens to Both Sides' Opinions
   [Our Newspaper's Report] The Texaco Oil Company's Gaoqiao Oil Depot previously employed a total of 400 workers. After the victory, due to the increase in projects, the number increased to 1,100. Recently, due to the reduction in business, the company believes that 500 people have become redundant and have to be gradually dismissed.

   Police Officer Jailed for Accepting Bribes
   [Our Newspaper's Report] The case of the hoarding of rice at the Gongyi Rice Shop at No. 932 Hengshan Road. Recently, the police bureau suddenly discovered that Jin Zhongliang, the manager who had been at large, had entrusted businessman Hu A'di to bribe Zhong He, the section chief of the Xujiahui Police Station, with 12 dans of white rice, worth 6 million yuan in legal tender, to seek the release of the detained employee Guo Jinhang.

Sorcerer Kills
   After a marriage proposal failed, the murderer is sentenced to life imprisonment
   The little craftsman Li Deyang, 29, was passionately in love with his cousin Chen Fengxian. Last year, he proposed to Chen, and although Chen agreed, Chen's father refused because the fortune teller said that the "eight characters" of the two did not match, and ordered his daughter to alienate Li. Li held a grudge and on the morning of March 3 last year, carrying a small leather knife, went to Chen's home at No. 117, Lane 409, South Second Road, to propose to her again. He said that Chen had fled to Hangzhou, and she did not agree. Li then threatened her with a knife. Chen called for help in a panic, and Li stabbed her in the throat, causing her to be injured and die. The murderer was later arrested by the police and sent to the District Court for trial on charges of murder. The case has been tried several times by the District Court and concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye pronounced the sentence in the Third Criminal Court: "Li Deyang is sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, deprived of civil rights for life, and the leather knife is confiscated." After hearing the sentence, the defendant cried non-stop and was immediately escorted back to prison by the bailiffs.

Traffic Interrupted on Xikang Road
   A Large Team of Police Captures Bandits
   Anti-Theft Drill Is Realistic
   [Our Newspaper's Report] At 7:58 PM last night, the duty room of the Putuo Road Police Station received a report from the No. 3 Road telephone police post that five bandits had broken into a department store at No. 596 Xinzeng Road. Three were wearing long gowns and two were wearing short clothes, holding two wooden-shell guns and two pistols. Qi Jingzhi, the director of the branch, was in charge of the command, with Zhu, the section chief, as his deputy. He immediately assembled nine groups of police officers, each group consisting of a mix of security police, plainclothes police, auxiliary police, and administrative police, with more than 400 people. Each group armed and set off quickly to block the main roads. As a result, the auxiliary police officer No. 2464 arrested a bandit, Tan Tu, at the intersection of Changshou Road and Xikang Road. Plainclothes police officer Shen Jinyao chased and arrested a bandit on Xinhui Road.

Spring and Autumn Forged Qin Tile Han Brick Chamber Talk Seal   Li Baifeng   Small Preface   The category of seals has passed through the Three Dynasties. The harmonious guidance and carved inscriptions still show rudimentary forms. Nearing the Han Dynasty, public seals flourished, mostly cast in bronze and jade, taking the meaning of talisman scripts. By the Tang and Song Dynasties, signatures and seals gradually became popular, flourishing in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties. Wang Yuanzhang changed the material to flowered talc, and seal studies extended to private individuals. When Wen Peng and He Zhen emerged, they initially revived the fading practice but did not break free from established patterns. Ding Jing, Deng Shiru, and others expanded it further, emulating the wise. The realm of seal studies became broader. Western seal engravers followed, numbering in the thousands. Hui Shu’s delicate and ingenious style marked an initial distinction, and the source became visible. However, the Xu brothers of Feihong Hall failed to integrate knife techniques, merely imitating appearances, preserving only the dregs in their carvings. This trend spread widely, leaving harmful effects everywhere, misleading naive beginners onto wrong paths, creating a clear distinction like that between the Jing and Wei rivers. In recent times, though there are scholars with broad knowledge, none have been able to strongly criticize its flaws. Furthermore, published works on seal engraving lack specialized treatises to correct later learners. Occasional simplified writings also lack insightful views, generally mixing things together without end, plagiarizing old theories, with minor perfections and major flaws mutually dependent. They cannot ascend to the realm of art, nor can they soar into the world of literature. Therefore, I present my shallow knowledge and humble opinions. I cherish even my worn belt. Carving is originally a minor skill, yet it can be comprehensively discussed by thousands of households. Removing the superfluous and redundant, I willingly accept self-deprecation. However, after the ravages of war, my collection of books was long consumed by fire. I can only offer a limited view, presenting my humble opinions and presumptuous words, fearing to mislead future learners. I humbly ask scholars both domestic and overseas to not be stingy with their teachings, so that I may avoid the fault of self-praise and not be unworthy of this era. My evaluations are based on no models. My discussions of knife techniques and composition strive to meet aesthetic conditions, to establish correct aesthetic concepts through meaning. As for ancient simplicity and elegance, I still follow the ancient masters, to open up a broader path for the future.   Intention and Composition   A Qing dynasty gentleman, Zhang Jun, said: "Intention precedes the brush, the knife does not move rashly; using abundant skill, grasp the true spirit beyond appearances." These words are indeed worthy of deep reflection for seal engravers. I have often seen vulgar seals in the market, claiming to emulate the Qin and Han Dynasties, or copying bronze vessels and tripods, or striving to imitate the Wan and Zhe schools, or privately admiring Ding and He... Most are upright and straight, planned with rulers, becoming mere craftsmanship. Even the smallest strokes show signs of contrivance. This is a great mistake.   Although seal engraving is a minor art, its strokes and undulations must be full of ancient meaning. This also strives to meet the conditions of "pictorial beauty," only then can it be called a masterwork. Therefore, composition is the most important thing in seal engraving. Ancient people discussing painting said: "In sparse areas, horses can gallop; in dense areas, not even a needle can be inserted." This can also be used as a reference for seal composition. I do not need to be like Mr. Qi Baishi, who "knew not of the Han Dynasty," but I also cannot be entirely occupied by the ancients. In general, the composition of the seal (that is, the arrangement of the characters) should contain a slightly decorative, artistic flavor. This is the superior approach.   According to our country's art, importance is placed on composition. Paintings have both sparse and dense areas, and Han seals also distinguish between composition. There are many discussions on this topic, but those who can possess unique ingenuity are only the venerable Cang Lao, Baishi, and Hui Shu. In earlier years, I saw Yang Zhongshou, Shigong, and others uniquely create blank spaces on the seal surface, their composition far more advanced than their predecessors, but their refined art was appreciated by few, becoming rare treasures. Even those who followed had insufficient brushwork and weak knife skills, merely pursuing superficialities. Others, such as Wu Nanyu and Ning, are either known for pleasing the vulgar or for deceiving the world with their reputation, sticking to established patterns, vainly seeking a semblance of the Qin and Han Dynasties, growing further from antiquity. The common saying of "evoking ancient sentiments" has become too ingrained, and the psychological yearning for the complexity of ancient times is even more intense, while our country's inherent artistic traditions have always emphasized "symmetry" and "evenness." Therefore, in the art of seal engraving, prejudices are difficult to shift, and individuals lack aesthetic cultivation, only stubbornly clinging to the outdated patterns of imitating, modeling, and copying the ancients... becoming infatuated with corpses. Seal engravers therefore dare not lightly cross the line.   In the past, when people painted, even a single stone, a single tree, a single person, a single horse, had to be sparsely spaced and artfully arranged. However, in seal engraving, this principle has long been ignored. Although the world places seal engraving alongside traditional Chinese painting, few use strict eyes to decide what to take and what to discard. Only if the lines are not pleasing to the eye and the strokes are evenly spaced is it considered a superior choice. However, even though seal engraving is a minor skill, attention should be paid to the interweaving and embracing of strokes, like flowing streams, sparse and dense, well-arranged. Gaps in the composition are blemishes. I have always advocated integrating new academic concepts into seal engraving composition, but those with shallow learning cannot understand this. Although some people in the late Qing Dynasty occasionally touched upon it, it was all accidental genius, so it was not widely promoted. As for carving and imitating the ancients, everything is upright and even, because in ordinary times, no attention has ever been paid to the idea of "composition."   My advocacy of this proposal may have the awareness of establishing a unique standard. I am not a frivolous youth, and I certainly dare not slander the sages of the past. Judging from my essays and short poems, one can know that I do not intend to belittle the ancients. Du Fu said: "I do not disparage modern men who love the ancients, elegant words and beautiful phrases must be neighbors," treating both ancient and modern people equally. And: "Unable to reach the former sages, there is no doubt, in adopting and following, whom should one precede?" There is also Li Bai's: "The Grand Odes have long not been written, who will present them when I decline?" How could I arbitrarily criticize the ancients? It is also out of necessity. Therefore, when we engrave seals, we must have no ancients in our minds before we can put the knife to the stone.   Only those who understand this principle are qualified to discuss the intention of seal composition; otherwise, sticking to the teachings of one's teacher is merely "re-engraving," not worthy of discussion of creation. How could it be worthy of being placed alongside calligraphy and painting in the arts?   In my opinion, seal engravers should not trivialize this minor art and treat it carelessly. Zhuangzi said: "If you enlarge the great, then nothing is not great; if you diminish the small, then nothing is not small." Seal engraving is indeed a minor skill, but even in the smallest ant, the Dao can be seen. We should not view Zhuangzi as frivolous and unrealistic, and treat it casually.   Using the Knife and the Wrist   Using the knife is like using the brush. This argument is certainly a platitude, but ignoring it has become a habit, losing the flavor of brushstrokes. The common term for seal engraving is "iron brush." Does it have no such meaning? Do today's seal engravers all wield the knife like a brush? I say: "No." The practice is to use the knife like an awl, merely cutting and scraping, unable to wield it like a master craftsman wielding an ax.   A good calligrapher does not discriminate against brushes, and a good seal engraver is not troubled by knives. One should take the central tip. Although the side tip can be slightly modified, the full force of the knife should be used to show the strength of a giant lion capturing a rabbit. I once saw Baishi wielding the knife, making one stroke to the end, never stopping, moving the knife like a giant boat parting waves, stone layers collapsing. Good calligraphers say that strength penetrates the back of the paper. Isn't this the case? Two strokes for one line reveals the marks of an ax. Although a broken mirror can be made round, it is not a flawless whole.   Therefore, the knife should be made of pure steel, especially heavy with a thin blade. The knife should have a flat edge. A beveled edge is powerless. Beginners should not choose the easy route. A flat-edged knife has no reserve power when moving, like writing without a wide brush. Seal engraving, a minor skill, requires the full force of the knife for every stroke and undulation. A giant lion uses all its strength to capture a rabbit; otherwise, the spirit will be lost, and there will be no vitality. Next, at the turning points of strokes, it is best to turn the blade in one stroke. If one wants to insert skills, the charm will be lost. The cracks in seal imitations of bronze vessels and stone tablets are not caused by human effort. The ancient, full-bodied feeling is from stone marks and mottling, like broken steles and ruined tablets, sought out without artificial arrangement.   If the wrist is weak when wielding the knife, the strokes will be uneven, easily damaging the frame. In the smallest horizontal, vertical, and dotted strokes, a weak wrist will result in stagnation and rigidity, tasteless like chewing wax, like a person's shoulders being cut apart by a pure knife. If one preserves the natural, smooth, round momentum, like the jade shoulders of a beautiful woman, round and charming, then the marks of the ax will not be revealed; otherwise, it will fall into stagnation and dullness, lacking elegance. The seniors Baishi, Cang Lao, and Yiting engraved seals, using a forceful, blunt cut, never stopping the blade. Coiled tendons and gnarled branches give it an excellent mystery. Baishi's knife edge is peculiarly strong, powerful, and the knife marks and ax traces are intertwined and dense, like trees with interlaced branches, swords and halberds arrayed, pleasing to the eye, with five colors shining. This also means that in the arrangement of lines and white space, there is still an artistic intention. Later imitations merely imitate the frame, losing the beauty of the interwoven composition, so the charm is gone, the strokes are entangled, and there is no novelty. Baishi's mantle is old and venerable, the golden knife is free and unrestrained, and only with talent and elegance can one establish one's own style. However, compared to Cang Lao, the strength is greater, but the spirit is weaker, still slightly distant, let alone us.   Seal engraving, a minor art, does not have to strive for the gentleness, softness, honesty, and sincerity of poetry, but being too unrestrained in temperament easily leads to crudeness. Li Bai and Su Shi were great talents throughout the ages, but if one's strength is insufficient, and one strives to follow them, one will become like Dong Shi.   Since seal studies fell into the hands of the Fei Hong Tang brothers, the vitality was lost. They sought even and slender strokes, and the edge lines were also deliberately imitating the ancients. The craftsmanship was heavy, and the artistic path was subtle.   Furthermore, when seal art spread eastward, the Japanese even more liked to imitate the Fei Hong Tang style, so their works rarely had good qualities.   The strength of the knife lies in the wrist and is focused on the fingers, just like using a brush. If the strength is purely in the fingers, it will not be able to work on an inch of leather, and the energy will be weak, and the spirit will be fatigued. The problem lies in the fingers. Wang Shaoling's Report in "Literary Tea" China's Artists in America Xu Zhongnian

Assistant professor of the Art Department of Columbia University in the United States, Mr. Wang Shaoling, returned to China not long ago, passed through Shanghai, and attended the 24th "Literary Tea Party" after the victory. Mr. Wang was originally an old friend of "Wen Cha": in those years, he not only participated in the Shanghai "Wen Cha," but also hosted another "Wen Cha" in Hong Kong. This time attending the Shanghai "Wen Cha" after the victory, after nine years of separation, his demeanor remains the same, and his studies have made even more progress. The tea friends then asked him to report: "Chinese Artists in America." Zhongnian recorded it as follows.

I stayed in the United States for nine years, first as a student, then as an assistant professor in the Art Department of Columbia University. At present, there are five or six Chinese students studying art in the United States, but I am afraid that only one brother is studying in a specialized department.

Shortly after the Pearl Harbor Incident, a grand Chinese painting exhibition was held in New York: the Chinese-style paintings were all works by Mr. Zhang Shuqi, and the Western-style paintings were my works. Americans warmly welcomed and unanimously praised them. During this period, there was also a political factor: Americans personally suffered from the Japanese, and only then did they understand the true meaning of China's long-term resistance. They had great sympathy for the Chinese people and Chinese culture, and took advantage of this art exhibition to express this sympathy as much as possible.

At that time, there was also Mr. Wang Qingyuan, a Chinese painter in New York.

Then, Mr. Zhang Shuqi went to Canada.

Before this, that is, in the early years of China's War of Resistance, Mr. Zhang Shanzi's paintings of tigers were very popular in the United States. Mr. Zhang's tigers were realistic, but they were created with Eastern brushstrokes. Americans were able to understand them because of their realism, and they admired them because of their Eastern colors.

Following Mr. Zhang Shanzi, it was Mr. Zhang Shuqi, and Mr. Zhang Shuqi's flowers and birds were even more popular with Americans. The publicity in the newspapers goes without saying. Before Christmas, everyone competed to buy New Year's cards painted by Mr. Zhang, which shows the love of the people.

The United States is a wealthy country, but it does not have a unique American culture. Americans absorb Chinese culture and also absorb European culture. Museums contain Chinese paintings (ancient and modern) and also contain a large number of French paintings, as well as paintings from other countries. The intersection of Chinese and Western cultures may produce American-based culture in the future.

I just returned from Nanjing; when I was in Beijing, I saw the professors of the Central University living in poverty, which was really heartbreaking! By analogy, it is known that the days of Chinese cultural people are difficult, but after all, the motherland is the motherland. I hope everyone cherishes it, endures hardship, and struggles for it! Viewing the National Woodcut Exhibition Jiading

Although I have never done woodcut, as soon as I heard the news of the National Woodcut Exhibition, I hurried to see it. I want to praise woodcut, because in this exhibition I have seen the brilliant future of woodcut.

Art can never jump out of reality, but should reflect reality and describe life. In China, woodcut has only 15 years of history since Lu Xun advocated it. During the War of Resistance, woodcut gave full play to some forces because it was suitable for environmental requirements. It is precisely because it grew up in suffering, unlike other arts that can be far away in ivory towers, it added a lot of power to the War of Resistance. After the victory, other forms of printing and drawing were restored, and woodcut, like drama, also fell into a low ebb. Some woodcut artists changed careers, and comics gradually replaced the status of woodcut. This exhibition tells us that this idea is a mistake.

The art of woodcut has indeed made significant progress in the year or so after the victory. The lines and composition have given us a new perspective. Especially in terms of content, the woodcut during the War of Resistance praised the sacred War of Resistance and expressed rural life. Now the content is mostly against the civil war, exposing the evils of society, and fighting for democracy. The subject matter did not give up the vast peasant life because many woodcut artists went to the city. The reality of the subject matter and the realism of the depiction can inspire people to a new path.

I love Li Hua's "Internal and External Unity" the most. Anger and power can be expressed. Secondly, his "Leaving Work" has soft and clear lines, and harmonious colors, which gives people a comfortable and peaceful feeling. "The Received Factory" and "The Dark Side of the City" fully express the characteristics of woodcut lines, and the scene matching is also very appropriate. Li Hua was originally an oil painter, and his works also have an oil painting flavor. We have to say that Li Hua has achieved the most and best results in this exhibition, and his reflection on reality is also the most powerful.

The edge of the knife has always been considered superior if it has "metallic quality." The lines are powerful, such as his "For the Sake of Having a Grandson," and Jing Chu's "Hankou Pier" also has the same style.

Among the color woodcuts, in addition to praising Li Hua's works, A Yang's "Welcoming Marriage Picture" and "Welcoming Lantern Picture" have a very Chinese flavor, and Ke Ping's "Returning Late" has an oil painting flavor, bright and beautiful. Those with special styles are like Qiu Xietang's "Embellishment Second Picture," which is carved with parallel knives. The neat lines form extremely beautiful patterns of sea waves and small boats. Zhang Diexi's "Slave Market" is superior in its chaos. Xi Ai's "Spring News" is composed entirely of soft curves, and Man Ping's "Pioneers" is a symbolic painting that brings unlimited hope to people. Ting Jie's "Firewood Gatherer" is set off by dark surfaces, and Mai Gan's "Shaving" uses the simplest knife-carved lines to depict it. Han Shangyi's "Pulling Training" uses earth piles to express strength, and Mai Gan's "Under the Overturned Nest" is entirely an imitation of Chinese painting, and Chen Xiaoxi's "Jiang Feng" is superior in its grandeur.

There are many good works. In this short year or so, we have been able to see so many good works. We should celebrate the future of woodcut. We hope that woodcut can go deeper into reality and become more popular.

Finally, I will record the two sentences I heard at the meeting below:

A foreign-looking person said: "My judgment criterion is to hold down the title below and see if the picture can express its meaning."

Another person said: "Chinese woodcut has not fully utilized the light and darkness."

Whether these two sentences are accurate is up to the woodcut writers to say. Landscape Xie Xianou An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 315 Ye Jingfeng

After hearing this, Tsurumi asked Masaiwa to reward the chauffeur with a glass of beer, got up himself, took a German-style twenty-shot pistol from his suitcase, attached the magazine to his waist, and prepared to go out. The chauffeur was flattered to receive the glass of beer. He thanked him again and again, gulped it down, and carefully put the glass on the corner of the door, licking his lips and tongue, as if he had received a glass of jade liquid and nectar.

"What do you think?" Tsurumi sent the chauffeur to wait in the car, closed the door again before leaving, and asked Masaiwa like this.

"First, the subordinates think that it is inconvenient to work here, and there are many people and mouths in the department, and it is not a place to work. The director wonders if you want me to prepare an ideal place for you first, as a base of operations."

"Very good, is there such an ideal place?"

"There are many: several large hotels opened by the Chinese are very ideal, and the telephone is also very convenient, especially the International Hotel in the new Concession, which is very quiet."

"Okay, what other suggestions?"

"Second, the subordinates think that Miss Nakamura must have been lured and imprisoned by some enemy. I just can't think of the purpose and goal. Perhaps the captain can figure it out in detail?"

"I'm afraid it's the tricks of Group Two's minions! But it's just a guess."

"Third, should we go to the park to see the corner of the white kimono? Maybe we can ask some truth?" Masaiwa expected that Pingzi's disappearance had nothing to do with the park appointment.

"If there is time, we can do that. But I think that is another matter and has nothing to do with this case... However, we have to find them, maybe it has something to do with the big goal we both have."

"One more thing, the subordinate wants to ask the captain to specify a time, the subordinate can call that friend first: because they are sometimes very busy..."

"Time?... I'm afraid I can't say for sure right now, I'll specify it later..."

In his own room, Tsurumi left a secret code note for Pingzi, explaining his current whereabouts, and told Pingzi to wait for him to come back if he returned to the hotel, and not to move around, etc. This was to prevent Pingzi from returning to the hotel safely and rushing out again.

The two of them, Tsurumi and Masaiwa, were in the car and arrived at the corner of the Bund and Nanjing Road. Tsurumi suddenly ordered the driver to stop. The original goal of their trip was to go to the International Hotel to rent a satisfactory room as a place to work, and they didn't want to stay at the Cathay Hotel at all, but Tsurumi temporarily had an idea to see what kind of place this huge building was, and maybe he would find something. After hearing Tsurumi's order, the driver immediately turned the car to the Nanjing Road intersection and stopped opposite the gate of the Cathay Hotel: at the moment of getting off and opening the door, he automatically pointed out the situation he had seen in the morning.

"Captain, please sit in the car for a few minutes, the subordinate will go to the hotel to make a few phone calls..."

"Okay..." Tsurumi nodded and got back into the car. Free Talk "Martial Spirit" Gao Wuhong

Is our weak country probably promoting "martial spirit"? Lately, typhoons have been rampant, fighting in the east, fighting in the west, you fight, he fights, everyone seems to be suffering from "liver ascending" syndrome, and they fight at the drop of a hat, making it clear. Conflicts between police and veterans, feuds between garrison troops and students, military personnel and newspapers... Such "fighting" cases have caused a smoky atmosphere, and it is impossible to sort them out. Opening the newspaper, you can often "respectfully read its grandeur."

This "fighting wind" has spread to the education sector, and it has even produced the strange news of students destroying newspaper offices. More than 100 students from the National Frontier School returned to Wuxi from Shanghai on the 8th of this month. After arriving at the station, a dispute arose with the train conductor over the issue of supplementary tickets. The next day, the Wuxi Ren Bao published this news, "recording everything that was heard." This was originally the duty of the newspaper office. Even if there were places where "rumors were untrue," the parties concerned should follow proper channels to state the facts to the newspaper authorities, supplement the truth, and request correction. The teachers and students of the Frontier School were very dissatisfied after reading the news about them published in the Ren Bao. At about 4 p.m. on the 9th, two teachers from the school went to the Ren Bao to negotiate, demanding correction and apology. That was it, but who knew that more than 100 "students" gathered, took two trucks, and "majestically" drove to the Ren Bao office. Regardless of whether the "negotiation" of the teachers who went first was successful, they shouted "fight" and carried away the business department, machinery, typecasting, typesetting room, etc., and beat the manager and two workers. The "mission" was completed in more than ten minutes, and then they "left triumphantly."

The "ill fortune" of the Wuxi newspaper office seems to be a bad omen. Last year, the Xibao and Daxi Bao were destroyed by the officers and soldiers of the Zongdui because of a piece of news. As a result, Tang Enbo, the former commander of the First Appeasement District, compensated for the losses. Now, the Ren Bao office has been destroyed by the students of the Frontier School because of a piece of news. Looking back on the past and chasing the past, it is inevitable to make people angry. "Freedom of the press" did not expect to create such a result.

Regardless of who is right and wrong in this matter, it is always a strange phenomenon in the Chinese education sector for students to destroy newspaper offices out of a moment of anger. Even if the fault lies with the newspaper office, students can negotiate according to reason and obtain a reasonable solution. How can this barbaric method of gathering a crowd to fight be like what college students who have received "higher education" do?

Now, everyone generally places hope on the next generation. Students should know how to respect themselves and change their style to clear everyone's ears and eyes. Banning Politics and Coffins Tao Ming

It has been more than a hundred years since opium was imported into China as a foreign product. To say that it is a "rare guest" is too ignorant; to say that it is an "acquaintance" is too distant; well, let's just admit that it is a direct descendant passed down from our ancestors. I ask whose fathers of young people around the age of 25 or older today have not snored and slept with it?

For the sake of banning opium, Lin Zexu once wrote a book to Emperor Daoguang with generosity and excitement, but naturally that was something of the former Qing Dynasty. After the times entered the Republic of China, the government belonged to another six-year opium ban plan. After the victory, on March 20, 1946, the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Association was established, issued a declaration, and announced the list of directors and supervisors. I say this only to prove that even in today's China, the harm of drug addiction is still spreading. Issuing many majestic announcements and declarations of banning smoking and drugs without earnestly implementing them is at most only increasing the burden on the filing cabinet. People who are addicted to smoking have become accustomed to these announcements and declarations, and at most they will grunt in a strange and strange manner after spitting out smoke, "Hum, the old tune is singing again." For decades, it seems that we have never been fortunate enough to see the power of the law reach that dark corner with a red light, and extinguish the ghostly sparks.

The expenditure for banning smoking has not been small, but with the "progress" of the times and in order to adapt to the requirements of the new objective facts, please see:

[Correspondent from Danyang, this newspaper] In order to show the county government's determination to ban drugs, two coffins were specially prepared on the afternoon of the 1st, one placed at the entrance of Shuangjing Lane and the other placed on Xianqiao, so that drug addicts would be shocked.

Chinese affairs are so difficult to handle. Just talking about banning smoking, so much capital has been invested in it. Spending money and banknotes is not a big deal, anyway, they are just inanimate silver, copper, and paper, but the lives of those who died in the "Opium War" have to be said to be too unworthy. And some time ago, another "Opium War" fought by Chinese and Chinese people occurred in Xikang. From this, you can discover the "bloody spirit of fighting to the death to protect the opium lamp" of the people of my Great Opium Kingdom. To be honest, the word "death" has never been valued in the country of opium gentlemen. The process from the opium couch to the coffin is originally extremely natural, not to mention that the preparation of coffins is only limited to "shocking" people. Age Zhan Wo

A man asked a lady he was thinking about how old she was.

"I am eighteen years old," she replied.

Later, the man went out to do business and did not see her for two or three years.

And in these years, he lost his capital.

When he came back, he saw her again. This lady forgot that they had met twice. She said: "I am only seventeen years old."

When the man heard this, he burst into tears. The lady asked him why he was like this. He said: "Your age is just like my capital, getting less and less, how can it not make people sad!" Shadow Talk "Dark Night, High Winds" Wu Bian

A thief, Li Jing, was released from prison. In order to make a living, he prepared to resume his old business. In the meantime, he had a dream. In his dream, he successively killed his son, accomplices, and classmates, seduced his classmate's wife, and seized his property, and attempted to rape his daughter. Finally, he jumped off a building and committed suicide under the siege of detectives. At this point, he woke up from the dream. His wife and children, who had been separated for five years, rushed to pick him up, and the story ended with a happy reunion.

Without going into the authenticity of such a story, it is difficult to find humanity in this thief Li Jing. In the story, he is not a pervert. He used to engage in robbery for a living. But now in the play, his homicidal behavior is really hard to find some psychological basis. It can be said that it is completely the screenwriter who instructed him to do this nonsense, just to form a series of horror and assassination events. Especially absurd is that the screenwriter arranged for the murder toxin to be installed in a fountain pen to kill people. Afterwards, it was impossible to discover that this was a poisoning death. However, Li Jing is just an ordinary thief. He is not an expert. Not to mention whether this kind of poison can exist, even if it does, it is impossible for an ordinary person to buy it casually in a pharmacy. So where did this poison come from?

If you remove the magic weapon in Li Jing's hand - the fountain pen containing poison - this story simply cannot develop, at least from the perspective of the film, Li Jing relied on his toxin to be able to act lawlessly. But every audience will understand that this was copied by the screenwriter from a Western film, and it was used clumsily. Because there is no such thing in Chinese society.

Also, the engineer's wife knew that Li Jing was the murderer who killed her husband and daughter's lover, but she did not report him to the police to arrest him. Even if it was not to avenge her husband, for the safety of herself and her children, why could she tolerate and indulge Li Jing to do whatever he wanted? And she is not a bad woman. These are very unreasonable.

This should have been a film that analyzes the rationality of crime, but director Tu Guangqi made a mistake and treated it as a horror film. Therefore, the performance seems incongruous. It is not scary enough, and there are countless superfluous and wasteful shots, but the film is still surprisingly short, only 75 minutes long.

Zhang Wan's Wu Yingxue is the best performance in the whole play, but Wang Danfeng has nothing to commend. Arts and Literature Circles

Tian Han, Ying Yunwei, Wu Tian, and Bu Shaofu, etc., went to Hangzhou for a spring outing. The Hangzhou Dramatists Association and the Zhejiang Provincial Drama Troupe jointly held a welcome dinner at the Hangzhou Youth Center, attended by more than 300 people from the drama and culture circles and students. During the banquet, Tian Han spoke about "Impressions of this visit to Hangzhou and the future of the drama movement," Ying Yunwei spoke about "Memories of engaging in drama," and also reported on his trip to find and compile film subjects and select locations for filming. Wu Tian spoke about "The Authenticity of Drama," and Bu Shaofu spoke about "The Prospects for Chinese Journalism in the Future." After the meeting, many people asked Tian Han for autographs.

The New China Drama Troupe has returned to Shanghai from Taiwan and is currently residing in Hongkou. It plans to perform in the Jiangnan area soon.

The Second Art Tea Party is scheduled to be held at the Police Agency at 47 Shaoxing Road at 2 p.m. on the 15th. On Li Wenzhong's Slander Mu Tao

Yue Wumu said: "Scholars die in remonstrance, and warriors die in battle." Therefore, the ministers of the Ming Dynasty always took pride in being punished in court for speaking frankly. The court punishment was a cruel policy, and although Yang Jiaoshan and others were great men of integrity throughout the ages, there were also many others who cited trivial matters or remonstrated because they should contend. This trend continued until the Qing Dynasty. Li Wenzhong's slander was also one of them. At that time, public opinion generally regarded Wenzhong as a traitor, so some humorists created a couplet that said: "Yang San is already dead, no Kun Chou; Mr. Li Er is a traitor." There is also a couplet that involves Weng Songchan: "The prime minister's Hefei is making the world thin, and the Secretary of Agriculture's Changshu is making the world barren." To be fair, Wenzhong had been in charge of Beiyang for a long time, and he was a person with a global perspective on diplomacy. If we criticize the wise like in the Spring and Autumn Annals, we can only say that Empress Dowager Cixi diverted the navy funds to build the Summer Palace. We cannot argue about whether to stay or leave. It is true that this was Wenzhong's shortcoming. However, who held the reins of the country? It was not Wenzhong alone who should be responsible. Even if he remonstrated but was not listened to, Wenzhong would retire and take care of himself. He would have succeeded in seeking his own interests. What benefit would it have to the country? As for the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the court had to overthrow Hefei at all costs and did not hesitate to use the country as a desperate gamble. People like Zhang Jian and Wen Yunge only knew how to curry favor with the powerful and clamorously advocated war. How could they know that although Hefei was overthrown, the Qing Dynasty was shaken from then on? If there had been no Sino-Japanese War, there would have been no Hundred Days' Reform; if there had been no Hundred Days' Reform, there would have been no Boxer Rebellion. These celebrities only had the intention of party strife and wanted to heap slander on Wenzhong alone. And the world was in turmoil, and there were many things from then on. What the Qing Dynasty lost was only the world of one family. And the people's livelihood has been in dire straits since then. Who is to blame? The Japanese invaders caused trouble for eight years, disrupted our country, and brought misery to our people. Tracing the beginning of the disaster, was it not the Sino-Japanese War that served as the fuse? Siege Qin Shouou

"The people of the world manage the affairs of the world. Is it okay to tell everyone to listen?" Unexpectedly, Lao Zhu was still smiling cheekily; they were less than two feet apart from each other, and he was not afraid at all.

Mrs. Xu is truly a well-deserved tigress. At this moment, when she was showing her power, she would naturally not spare those who lightly stroked the tiger's whiskers. With a "bullshit," she raised her right hand forward, wanting to hit Lao Zhu's left cheek; but Lao Zhu's hands and eyes were faster than hers, and with a lift of his hand, he grabbed her. She tried to change to her left hand, but it didn't work, and she was also grabbed tightly by the other party; Lao Zhu suppressed his anger for a long time, and took this opportunity to use all his strength to tighten her two wrists twice.

"Dead man! Kill a thousand knives!" Mrs. Xu, who encountered an opponent for the first time since birth, was both angry and in pain, and she jumped up and down anxiously, shouting loudly without stopping!

Lao Zhu was still smiling.

"Okay! Lao Zhu, let go! Let go!" Fatty Xu was so anxious that he rolled down the stone steps, crying and shouting to Lao Zhu.

"I can't let go! As soon as I let go, she will still hit me." Lao Zhu laughed loudly and said.

"Dead man! You damned thing! I'm going to fight you today!" As soon as Fatty Xu came forward, his wife felt that today's matter was related to her prestige, and she must not let Lao Zhu go. She shouted madly like killing a pig, and her body almost rolled onto the ground.

Xu Shaoming shouted anxiously: "Lao Zhu, press down! Press down!"

"Mr. Zhu, please let go! This is not good!" Lan also came up to persuade him.

At this time, Zhu Zhaonian also felt that it was easy to tie a

### Hurley Accuses U.S. Foreign Policy

Claiming it Violates the Atlantic Charter

[Central News Agency, Cincinnati, 11th Associated Press Dispatch] Former U.S. Ambassador to China, Hurley, stated today: From Byrnes's trip to Yalta until his resignation, except for the control of the atomic bomb, the Soviet Union obtained all of its international demands. In terms of diplomacy, the United States abandoned all the principles that American leaders claimed were the purpose of the war. The United States agreed in Yalta to violate the provisions of the Atlantic Charter, and various violations of the Charter after Yalta were approved by the U.S. diplomatic side. For example, the concessions made by the United States to the Soviet Union in terms of Eurasian territory, and the support of French and Dutch imperialism by the United States in the Pacific region, all prove the United States' disregard for the Atlantic Charter.

### Anglo-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations

A Concrete Outcome Cannot Be Reached Immediately

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 11th] Representatives of Britain and the Soviet Union held their third meeting today to discuss revising the treaty between the two countries. According to political figures here, the British proposal is based on the provisions of the Anglo-French alliance, but the Soviet side favors explicitly specifying the obligations of both parties, which is no different from the initial Franco-Soviet alliance. However, today's meeting was still preliminary in nature, so a concrete outcome is unlikely to be reached during the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Four-Power Naval Agreement

Distributing Remaining Italian Warships

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] The French Foreign Ministry revealed today that the four powers signed a naval treaty on February 10, stipulating the establishment of a committee to allocate the remaining Italian warships according to the Italian peace treaty. The committee is expected to meet in Paris soon. The treaty also stipulates that the Soviet Union will return to Britain one British battleship and several torpedo boats and submarines lent during the war, and the U.S. cruiser Milwaukee will be returned to the United States.

### Final Meeting of the League of Nations

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 12th] The final meeting of the League of Nations Liquidation Committee was convened this morning by Norwegian Parliament Speaker Hambro in this city. Our country's representative to the committee, Ambassador to the United Kingdom Zheng Tianxi, is likely to arrive here on the morning of the 14th to attend the meeting. It is said that after this meeting, the former League of Nations will come to a complete end. The Liquidation Committee's report will be published in June.

### Lindbergh Expresses Views

Endorsing Truman's Foreign Policy

[This Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 12th Broadcast: The famous aviator Lindbergh, who was once an extreme isolationist, has been silent for a long time. Suddenly, he issued a statement endorsing Truman's new foreign policy and advocating the completion of America's overseas goals, even if it requires the use of force. Lindbergh said that the U.S. policy towards Europe is to assist countries with ideas similar to those of the United States. Lindbergh also said: We have destroyed Nazi Germany, but the result is to enhance the strength of the Communist Soviet Union.

### U.N. Relief Ship Carrying Dairy Cattle to China Returns to America Mid-Voyage

Due to Engine Trouble on the Ship

[United Press, San Diego, California, 12th] The Coast Guard received a radio message today that the ship "Plymouth Victory," carrying U.N. dairy cattle to China, had engine trouble mid-voyage and has now been towed by a U.S. Navy tugboat to near Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone. It is expected to be towed to San Pedro Harbor on the 18th of this month.

### Turkish Newspaper Reveals Soviet Conspiracy: The USSR Tried to Get Bulgaria to Attack Turkey During the War

[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 11th] The Ulus newspaper recently reported that the Soviet Union attempted in early 1941 to get Bulgaria to attack Turkey, promising to cede eastern Thrace to Bulgaria as a condition for Bulgaria declaring war on Turkey. At that time, Hitler telegraphed President Inonu, stating that Germany would not attack Turkey. As for the mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and Turkey, it had a secret clause stipulating that Britain and France should provide Turkey with military equipment worth 25 million pounds, but Britain did not fulfill this clause until 1941. In light of this, Soviet representative Gromyko's statement in the Security Council, attacking Turkey for adopting a pro-German policy during the war, is self-defeating. In addition, the Turkish government will issue a statement regarding the policies it adopted during the war.

### Yugoslavia Moves Italian Property from Trieste: U.S. Protests to Yugoslavia, Claiming the Move is Illegal and Harms the Region's Economy

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Acting Secretary of State Acheson stated at a press conference that the U.S. government has lodged a strong protest with Yugoslavia regarding Yugoslavia's removal of Italian property from the portion of the Free Territory of Trieste currently occupied by Yugoslav troops. The protest letter pointed out that the removal of such property was done without the consent of the original Italian owners, without legal procedures, or compensation to the original owners. Those removed included industrial property and supplies. This move is not only illegal but also harms the region's economy. Acheson said that the protest letter was delivered to the Yugoslav Ambassador to the United States on March 27 and has not yet received a response. Acheson also revealed that the United States also protested on February 17 the Yugoslav court's declaration of nine or ten Italian ships sunk during the war in Yugoslav-controlled waters as war booty, because according to the Italian surrender agreement and agreements between the Allies, the disposition of these ships should be determined by the Allies, and Yugoslavia cannot unilaterally declare them as its property.

### Newfoundland Parliament Discussing Future Forms of Government

There is a Considerable Possibility of Joining the United States

[United Press, St. John's, Newfoundland, 11th] The Newfoundland Parliament began discussing future forms of government today, so that the United States can recognize it as its fourth-largest state, and has elected representatives to discuss with the British and Canadian governments within the next two months whether to maintain its status as a British dominion or join Canada as its tenth province. If the United States agrees, it will also elect another delegation to negotiate the conditions for joining the United States. The United States has 99-year lease agreements for bases in St. John's, Argentia, and Stephenville, and is unwilling to abandon them, which will become a major problem. According to Washington telegrams, those familiar with the situation in Newfoundland say that obtaining U.S. statehood is very complicated and will take a long time. According to those in charge, this is interesting news, but no formal notification has been received regarding this proposal.

### U.S. Grain Exports: Can Reach 400 Million Bushels Before May

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that if the current ship tonnage can be maintained, it will be able to complete its plan to export 400 million bushels of grain before May 1. Among them, 267 million bushels are wheat and flour, and 133 million bushels are corn and other miscellaneous grains.

On March 25, a simple ceremony was held on the 63rd floor of the Empire State Building in New York, where the son of U.S. millionaire Rockefeller presented a check for $8.5 million to U.N. Secretary-General Lie (the neutral figure) to purchase the new U.N. headquarters. (Photo courtesy of the New York Times, special dispatch for this newspaper)

### Truman Delivers Broadcast on Anniversary of Roosevelt's Death, Praising Him as a Great Humanitarian

[Reuters, Kansas City, 12th] President Truman delivered a broadcast on the anniversary of President Roosevelt's death, praising him as a great humanitarian. Truman said that the tombstone of President Roosevelt at Hyde Park only has the words "Born in 1881, Died in 1945" inscribed on it, but I have seen, heard, and imagined that people all over the world will never forget Roosevelt. This is a very natural reaction from humanity to Roosevelt's personality and character, and it is an echo of sympathy and understanding of suffering for Roosevelt.

### Roosevelt's Home:

Visited by 500,000 People

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 11th] The late President Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park has been visited by nearly 500,000 people since it opened last year. This property, including the late president's residence, tomb, and 33 acres of land, was donated to the people of the United States by Mrs. Roosevelt on April 12, 1946, the first anniversary of the president's death. Records show that visitors came from all over the United States and at least 54 other countries. The number of people visiting the tomb on September 1 last year reached 9,837, the highest record for a single day.

### Wallace Speech:

Hoping Britain Will Exercise Prudence and Restraint

[United Press, London, 11th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace delivered a speech at a forum initiated by the "New Statesman and Nation" weekly here today, re-criticizing President Truman's Middle East policy. It is said that if Britain can refuse to participate in either side of the U.S. and Soviet Union, a world war can be avoided. The weekly is the mouthpiece of left-wing members of the British Labour Party who oppose the current government's foreign policy. Wallace also said: "If your country can show the way, it is not too late for all progressive nations in the world to call for a strong United Nations organization and the principles of world progress. I do not believe there will be a war this month or next month, but I am sure that if the current policy is allowed to continue, it will produce a solid framework in the coming months that will constantly support psychological warfare, subsequently lead to a recession in the United States, and finally lead to a world war. The same is true for the Soviet Union. In the short term, a tough policy toward the Soviet Union has been quite effective. In the long term, I really don't understand how it can help peace."

### U.S. House Labor Committee:

Passes New Bill

Weakening Union Power and Outlawing Strikes

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The House Labor Committee today passed a major new bill, weakening union power and outlawing strikes. The bill stipulates that workers may not negotiate wages and other issues with the factory on a trade-by-trade basis. Workers in the same factory do not have to belong to the union, unless labor and management agree otherwise. However, the committee is willing to wait until next week to present it for discussion in the House.

### British Monarch to Return to Capital on Schedule

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] It was announced here this morning that King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, along with their two princesses, will return from South Africa to Portsmouth Harbor on the 11th of next month, still aboard Britain's newest battleship, the "Vanguard." The British royal party is expected to disembark at the port on the 12th of next month, and then take a special train to London.

### Far Eastern Commission Instructs to Eliminate Ideologies from Japanese Schools

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] It is learned that the Far Eastern Commission has ordered Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers General MacArthur to take appropriate measures to eliminate all militaristic, narrowly nationalistic, and totalitarian ideologies from Japanese schools at all levels, and to reform the system to encourage democratic ideas among students and teachers.

### Atomic Bomb Injuries Can Be Treated

[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, 12th] University of Chicago professors Allen and Jacobson today published an article in a medical journal stating that they have discovered a chemical, called "Lannerine," that can treat internal bleeding. This condition is one of the serious consequences of exposure to radiation from atomic bombs and other sources, and is inevitably fatal sooner or later, but unexpectedly, there is a medicine to save it.

### Chinese Representative Dr. Jin Wensi Speaks at International Trade Conference: Stabilizing the Economy Requires First Reducing Tariffs

[Reuters, Geneva, 11th] China's Chief Representative, Ambassador to Belgium Dr. Jin Wensi, addressed the International Trade Conference in this city, strongly arguing that tariffs must be reduced before the general economic situation can be stabilized. He said that the opinions of the Chinese delegation can be summarized as follows: (1) Countries with export markets abroad and domestic production institutions that are producing at full capacity should bear greater responsibility for the success of tariff negotiations than less economically developed countries; (2) The principle of balance should be followed when it comes to the concessions proposed and obtained by a country during negotiations. However, when measuring the sacrifices made by any country, the degree of economic development of that country, the post-war reconstruction problems that must be solved, and whether or not it already has low tariffs should be taken as the criteria.

### Cripps Emphasizes Employment

[Reuters, Geneva, 11th] British Secretary of Commerce Cripps addressed the International Trade Conference today, requesting that the United States maintain and satisfy the production requirements of other countries in the world. He said that the prosperity of Britain and other countries depends on expanding world trade based on the principle of international division of labor. In the charter of the International Trade Organization, member states should strive for the goal of high employment to maintain high and stable levels of demand for goods in various countries and to maintain the real income of the people of various countries. Prior to this, Cripps stated at a press conference that the U.S. reduction of tariffs was not enough to easily replace the British government's abandonment of the imperial trade preference system, because the reduction of tariffs would inevitably be limited, and the removal of the preference system should also be subject to limitations.
