### Authorities to Formulate Specific Measures for Control of Daily Necessities

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The authorities have formulated specific measures for the control of daily necessities. These measures were drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs based on the "Emergency Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities" promulgated on February 3, 1941, with reference to the current actual situation. The name has been changed to "Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Speculation of Daily Necessities." They were submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd and decided to be handed over to Wang Yunwu and others for review. The content of these measures is divided into four major categories: food, clothing, use, and raw materials for daily necessities. The detailed items stipulated for control in each category are less than the original measures, but the control is strengthened, and absolute suppression measures are adopted. If there are violations, the handling will be stricter than in the past. As for the control method, the government and various trade associations will cooperate. Merchants in each industry will register their inventories with the association and report to the competent authorities, and report on the situation of incoming and outgoing goods to the association at any time. If there are illegal transactions, they will be suppressed. For inventories held by people outside the industry, the competent authorities will set a time limit for sale or sale at the location where the goods are needed. If the inventory cannot be cleared within the sales period, the competent authorities will sell it on their behalf and may purchase it at an assessed price if necessary. These measures can be promulgated and implemented after being passed at the Executive Yuan meeting.

### Canadian Government Suddenly Orders Suspension of Military Rice Shipments to China

[Reuters, Vancouver, 26th] The Canadian government suddenly ordered on the 26th to stop the shipment of 650 tons of machine gun bullets and 35 tons of aircraft flares to China for supply to the Chinese National Government. Canadian public opinion has recently criticized the government a lot for the shipment of military supplies to China, accusing the government of being involved in the Chinese civil war. However, the government has not yet explained the reason for canceling the shipping order.

Another ship is now being used for transportation.

### Legislative Yuan Decides to Re-examine Draft Presidential Office Organization; President Sun Points Out Organization Too Large

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The Legislative Yuan held its last meeting of the 36th year on the morning of the 27th, presided over by President Sun. First, Secretary-General Lou Tongsun read the State Council's instructions, and the postal rate increase case was submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures. Next, Liu Zhiping inquired about the process of the State Council's discussion on the adjustment of civil servant salaries. President Sun reported that the recommendations made by the Planning Committee were not very different from the original resolutions of the Legislative Yuan. However, if the new plan is implemented, the salary of civil servants alone would be more than double the total semi-annual budget. The State Council decided to hand it over to a special committee for review. The committee will meet this afternoon to continue the discussion and passed the following major cases: Regulations on the Organization of Salt Administration Bureaus in Various Regions of the Ministry of Finance; Regulations on the Organization of the Yellow River Flood Area Rehabilitation Bureau; Measures for Reassigning Demobilized Military Officers and Soldiers Who Pass the Special Examination and Transfer Examination to Civilian Positions; Regulations on Granting Land to Honored Veterans.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Legislative Yuan discussed the draft Presidential Office Organization Law on the 27th and decided to re-examine it. The original draft had 25 articles. According to a letter from the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government to the Legislative Yuan: "Its content refers to the national conditions and meets the actual needs, using the organizational laws of the Civil and Military Affairs Offices as a blueprint, adopting a one-yuan system, adding a General Office, and establishing political advisory boards and strategic advisory institutions outside the Merit Evaluation Committee, in order to assist the head of state in exercising the powers conferred on the president in the Constitution. As for the accounting office and the design and assessment office, which originally belonged to the National Government, they are transferred to the Executive Yuan. The number of personnel listed is the necessary organization for presidential consultation and a very small number added due to the adoption of a one-yuan system. The personnel in the Civil and Military Affairs Offices are all from the old system and will not be increased or decreased. This arrangement is more connected than the existing organizations of various units in the National Government." The Constitutional and Legal Committee of the Legislative Yuan reviewed and passed the draft on the 26th. The revised draft has a total of 24 articles. When it was submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 27th for discussion, Commissioner Chen Ruxuan spoke first, criticizing the organization for being too large. Sun Jiulu said that it seemed inappropriate to retain the Military Affairs Bureau and abolish the Political Affairs Bureau. (Continued on page 2, column 4)

### British Advisor to the Ministry of Food, Huth, Arrives in Nanjing to Work

He told reporters that his task is to assist in the establishment of China's food distribution system. However, since he has just arrived in China, he must extensively exchange views with our experts and responsible officials before he can make any suggestions. Mr. Huth said that England is a food-importing country, while China is a food-producing country. The British rationing system cannot be applied to China and a different plan must be made. He believes that the rationing system is not enough to learn from. If a country has abundant food, it is not necessary. If it is just enough to eat, the rationing system can be effective. He will conduct research on the handling of China's food problems in the short term.

### Postponement of Bond Offsetting for Bank and Money Shop Deposit Reserve; Full Cash Payment to Implement Financial Control

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Regarding the issue of banks and money shops using bonds to offset the deposit reserve, the authorities have recently decided to postpone its implementation. Banks and money shops should still pay all deposit reserves in cash. This is a statement from the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance. It is said that after the promulgation and implementation of the Banking Law, the Ministry of Finance, with reference to the financial situation, approved that banks and money shops could use government bonds and treasury bills to offset this reserve at the approved price standard, but it should not exceed 50% of the total amount payable, and it was stipulated that it would be implemented from January 1, 1948. However, now is the time to strengthen financial control and tighten credit, and the above-mentioned offsetting with bonds has to be reconsidered. The decision has been made to postpone the original plan that deposit reserves could be offset with bonds from January 1st next year. The deposit reserves payable by each bank and money shop should still be paid in full cash to implement the policy of strengthening financial control.

### The United States Will Clarify Its Policy Towards Japan; Decisions Possible During the Next Congress

[United Press, Washington, 27th] As the year comes to an end, Washington predicts that a comprehensive change in U.S. policy toward Japan may occur, the main reason being the recent failure of the four-power foreign ministers meeting in London. Members of Congress believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate with Britain, France, and the United States in Europe has provided the United States with a solid basis for reviewing its Pacific policy. The main issue in the minds of the American people this year regarding Japan is when to sign a peace treaty with Japan. The majority of people inside and outside the government believe that the time is near, and the Japanese issue will receive more attention in January when Congress reconvenes. According to most members of Congress, the U.S. occupation policy toward Japan will also be reviewed by Congress again. Members of Congress and the business community are now increasingly criticizing the economic and social reforms implemented in Japan as being contrary to the interests of Britain and the United States and inconsistent with democratic principles. At the same time, American public opinion unanimously supports Congress in seeking to clarify the Japanese issue.

### The Washington Post Emphasizes the Amount of U.S. Aid to China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] According to today's Washington Post, the amount of U.S. aid to China has reached $1.398 billion since the Japanese surrender. The Post published today statistics on U.S. financial aid to China and followed the general opinion of the State Department, emphasizing the so-called "extremely large" economic aid to China in response to those who criticize the United States for ignoring Chairman Chiang. The amount published by the newspaper is based on "new official figures," which is $70,000 more than the one published by the President's Economic Advisory Committee in October. The State Department is now responding to the request made during the recent debate by the Senate Appropriations Committee to revise the information on temporary aid to China in detail. The State Department does not comment on the Post's news before this work is completed. The Post has always strived to advocate aid to Europe. It is said that the above-mentioned figures include the U.S. aid to China under the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) program, but it failed to explain the "full facts" of U.S. aid to China after the Japanese surrender. The newspaper continued to say that figures alone are not enough to explain how the United States equipped 39 divisions for Chairman Chiang and carried out the great plan to train the Chinese Navy in Qingdao. In order to emphasize the large amount of U.S. aid to China, the newspaper also said that 271 U.S. Navy ships have now been transferred to China, but the Post did not point out that between July 1, 1945, and June 30, 1947, U.S. aid in funds, materials, and credit loans to China only accounted for 2.5% of the total, while Britain accounted for 48.6% and France accounted for 20.9%. The military aid included in the Post's report includes the $728 million under the military lend-lease program, the $49 million oil pipeline credit loan under the civilian lend-lease program, the $83 million credit loan approved by the Export-Import Bank, the $468 million U.S. aid to China under the UNRRA relief program, the $40 million credit loan for purchasing surplus materials, and the $30 million relief expenses after the end of UNRRA, totaling $1.398 billion. However, officials of the Foreign Surplus Materials Liquidation Committee were unable to verify the above-mentioned $40 million credit loan for surplus materials.

### From Emphasis on Education to Silk Weaving Education

— Wang Mengfan

Although the current emphasis in China is not on the textile industry, the "clothing" of the nation's 450 million people cannot be separated from the support of the textile industry. Therefore, developing the textile industry is, in the process of nation-building, a matter of utmost urgency. Moreover, our nation's textile industry has always been backward, making it even more imperative to catch up quickly. However, the key to developing the textile industry lies not in adding more textile machines or increasing the supply of raw cotton, but in cultivating textile talent. Nantong College is the only textile school in the country. Amidst the various discussions on "striving for academic independence" and "emphasis on education," their approach to managing textile education seems to warrant discussion.

Nantong College is located in Nantong, Jiangsu, representing the coastal area of the Jianghuai Delta. The greatest need of this coastal area is land reclamation. The primary crop for reclamation is cotton. Nantong College has a long history and made significant contributions to cotton research. In the future, they can further seize this advantage and engage in substantive development. All kinds of research facilities related to cotton cultivation can form a system and be nurtured, so that areas with the same natural conditions as this region in China and around the world can use Nantong College's cotton research as a reference. However, in addition to its own research, the cotton cultivation department is closely related to various fields such as insects, soil, fertilizer, meteorology, agricultural implements, cotton production, as well as surveying, water conservancy, rural cooperation, and farm management related to land reclamation. Based on this alone, it is sufficient to become a college.

As for textile manufacturing, it is a continuation of cotton cultivation. Nantong College is the first textile school in China, with a glorious record in the history of Chinese textile education. Mr. Zhang Jian's cotton-based policy, advocated for local development, was aimed at connecting cotton cultivation and textile manufacturing. However, if Nantong College wants to make textile manufacturing its focus in education, it should pay attention to the following issues:

Increasing the number of spindles and looms; Improving the vast majority of hand-spinning, home textile manufacturing, and machine textile manufacturing; Self-sufficiency in textile machinery; Coordination between cotton-producing areas and cotton textile manufacturing nationwide, and the development of the national economy; The market for textile products. These issues are related to various applied sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. If all of these can form a system and be enriched, it can certainly become a separate university and more.

However, some also say: To strive for an independent academic field, one should not dissect it too finely, extracting a branch from a department (such as cotton reclamation) or singling out a small category from applied departments (such as textile manufacturing) as a base for striving for academic independence. While this view may seem reasonable, we must pay attention to the fact that in striving for academic independence to achieve national independence, we must also pay attention to the rapid conditions for catching up in the midst of slow academic research. Under this "realistic" and "quick-acting" demand, it should be necessary to specifically extract a small, single application scope in the academic field and make it the center. Therefore, we want to target the Jianghuai coastal area that needs cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, with Nantong College as the center of research, experimentation, and promotion of cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, and further become one of the cotton cultivation and textile centers for the whole country and the world.

To fully realize this vision, equipment and talent are certainly needed. Regarding equipment, the government, the school itself, and the society should concentrate their efforts to enrich it. This base for striving for national academic independence should represent the entire nation. The government should not distinguish between public and private, and should fully support it at all times, collecting as much important equipment from around the world as possible and placing it all in one place to enrich it. Within the school, although each department should continue to be managed, priority should be given to those related to cotton cultivation and textile manufacturing in enriching equipment. This period should be set for at least five or ten years, and after it is generally enriched and has first-class conditions, a plan for the next step should be formulated. Regarding talent: including world-class scholars with research on cotton and textile manufacturing, entrepreneurs in cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, experts with insights into cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, researchers who have received basic training and are eager to pursue further studies, and teachers who are responsible for basic training. These talents should all take research, experimentation, and promotion of cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing as their lifelong career, and their compensation must be increased so that it will be able to attract specialized talent from home and abroad.

In summary, from the emphasis on education to cotton reclamation and textile education, the focus of Nantong College is not only to add departments and complete the university, but also to seek the emphasis to establish an academic center. Although this piecemeal approach may be considered unfair to departments other than cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing, most of the past and present departments of Nantong College are somewhat related to cotton reclamation and textile manufacturing. Even the medical department, in the initial intention of the founding president Mr. Zhang Jian, was in response to the natural needs of the region after the development of agricultural reclamation and industry, and was still developed in coordination with reclamation and textile manufacturing. Therefore, the movement to transform Nantong College into a university, observed from this perspective, deserves the support of the government and society.

Draft Organization of the Presidential Office

(Continued from page 1) Wang Jun advocated that the Director of the General Office be similar to the Vice President, which should not be established. Sun, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, said that last year, the National Assembly discussed in detail Chapter 4 of the Constitution regarding the position and powers of the President. Some advocated the American system, while others advocated the French system. The American President is equivalent to the head of state and also the head of government, having two qualifications. Although the White House organization has gradually become complex after World War II, its content is still simple, with only a secretary. President Roosevelt established the Chief of Staff of the Army and Navy, but there was no military affairs office. The civilian office had only an adjutant to follow. The French President is equivalent to the head of state, only issuing orders but not executing them. According to Articles 35 to 44 of Chapter 4 of our Constitution, the President is completely the head of state, equivalent to the President of a responsible cabinet, while the head of government is the Premier of the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan manages political affairs, and the Ministry of National Defense manages military affairs. The President does not directly issue orders but must pass through the regular government agencies. From this perspective, the system of the Presidential Office should be simple, even simpler than the American system. President Sun also pointed out that the secretaries under the American President are not ministers. Our country's translation of the American Secretary of State has been traditionally translated as "Guowu Qing," which is a feudal idea and a mistake. The American Secretary of State has two tasks: coordination between the central government and the states, and the United States' foreign affairs. Recently, since all state associations have been established, the special party is responsible for foreign affairs. President Sun advocated that the organization of our Presidential Office should not directly manage political affairs, otherwise it would become two governments, and the powers would not be clear, inevitably leading to disputes between the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan. All matters, large and small, should be under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Moreover, the political advisors in the Presidential Office inevitably have the suspicion of participating in and interfering with politics. The original draft lacked consideration. The case was handed over to the Constitutional and Regulatory Committee for re-examination, and it is not necessary to use it as a blueprint. It is hoped that it will be completed by the end of January or early February and submitted to the next general meeting for discussion.

Hebei Refugees Petition the Chairman

Requesting Troops to Suppress the Communist Bandits

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] Several thousand refugee families from Beima Fang Town, Zhanggezhuang, and Yukou Town in Sanhe County, Hebei Province, led by Guo Wei and others, recently petitioned the Chairman: The people have mostly made a living by farming. Since March of this year, thousands of Communist bandits suddenly came and occupied the villages of Beima Fang Town, Zhanggezhuang, and Yukou Town where the people lived. They drafted able-bodied men from thousands of families into the bandit ranks to fight, and drafted young women into labor teams to work. The elderly were forced to farm and plant cotton, handing over rent, shoes, and socks. Assets and food were transported away for public use. After the autumn harvest in August, the bandits forced the harvesting of crops and transported them away. They also carried out large-scale class struggles. All slightly wealthy families were robbed clean, and the old and young were taken away. They gathered people to announce crimes, or executed or imprisoned them, suffering inhuman torture. The people could not bear the abuse and have now agreed to flee to Peiping. Now parents, wives, sisters, and brothers are all in the hands of the bandits. They beg the Chairman for great compassion, and beg the Director of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, together with local teams, to suppress and recover the lost territory. Please do not continue to ignore us, and rescue the people's lives. It would be the greatest gratitude.

Communist Bandits Disregard Refugees

Misappropriate Relief Supplies

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 27th] According to the confession of Chang, the instructor of the Communist bandit Xihua County team: The Communist bandits flowing in the Huang Pan area, because of the lack of products and the difficulty of living in the area, transferred the rice, noodles, and other food they received as relief to military use, and did not distribute them to the refugees. According to our army's inspection of the cotton quilts of the Communist bandit officers and soldiers seized in the Ma (north of Xihua) battle, all were made of cloth distributed by the relief agencies to relieve refugees. Recently, after the Communist bandits captured Xuchang, they forced the relief agencies. All these actions disregard the lives of the compatriots in distress and misappropriate relief supplies to be used as tools for rebellion, which is the most inhumane and despicable behavior.

Communist Bandits Disrupt River Works

Arson, Murder and Looting Become More Fierce

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] According to the Ministry of Water Resources, the Huanghe Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau telegraphed: Communist bandits harass the dikes, engaging in arson, murder, and looting wherever they go, and are more ferocious than before. Recently, they went to Huanggu and conducted a large-scale search. Pan, a soldier of the engineering team, and Tian Jintang were captured. The remaining employees fled to the Gao Village construction site. The housing in Huosai was also set on fire. The whereabouts of the employees in Pandi are still unknown. Since the beginning of the engineering period this year, the Communist bandits have constantly harassed our construction site. Squad members and soldiers have been captured and injured. Although it is now early winter and the engineering period has passed, the large flow is still above Liuzhuang Gao Village and has not moved outward. The farmland outside the dikes is still lower than the water surface inside, and the situation is still urgent. Employees have always risked lurking at the construction site, adding repairs and guarding, and dare not leave for a moment. Recently, the Communist bandits have threatened that they will kill any river workers captured in the future and will never forgive them, hoping to destroy the dikes and cause a catastrophe. It is reported that the ministry, after receiving the report, has ordered strict precautions to be taken and the defense to be strengthened.

### Britain Reviews Foreign Policy Bevin Plans to Submit Draft to Cabinet

British and American Cooperation Needed to Curb Soviet Influence

[United Press, London, December 26th] Britain may take initial practical steps next week to abandon its role as a post-war world mediator and partner with the United States to contain the Soviet Union. The British Cabinet is scheduled to hold a plenary session next Monday to discuss a provisional draft of British foreign policy, prepared by Foreign Secretary Bevin after the breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Government officials do not want to underestimate the importance of this Cabinet decision, privately stating that the resolution includes not only policy issues related to Germany but also all areas related to the economic and ideological conflict between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Although saddened by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's accusations of British imperialism, Bevin reportedly does not want to implement a showdown to avoid an indefinite end to the Four Powers consultations. Before the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, British Foreign Office spokesmen repeatedly reiterated their belief that East-West disputes could be resolved through compromise. Even after the conference ended, Bevin was unwilling to participate in the Marshall Plan to prevent the Soviet Union from removing German factories. Since then, several factors have changed the situation, which have helped Bevin's decision-making and expanded Cabinet support for U.S. policy. The main factor is President Truman's aid plan for Europe submitted to Congress. Another factor is Britain's anger at the Soviet Union's intensified anti-American movement in Greece and the Middle East. Other factors include the establishment of a Greek communist government, which may receive open support from countries under Soviet influence.

The memorandum submitted by Bevin to the Cabinet is strictly confidential, but it generally consists of: (1) finding ways to invite France to participate in British and American economic cooperation in West Germany; (2) the potential crisis caused by the expansion of political control in the Western occupation zones; (3) taking various steps to increase Britain's position among Arab countries through alliance treaties; and (4) the goals of Britain and the Commonwealth once the peace treaty with Japan is drafted.

### Former Secretary of State Welles Writes Extensively on US Policy Toward the Soviet Union

Makes Seven Major Mistakes on World Issues

[Our News] New York, December 27th Broadcast: Former US Secretary of State Welles wrote an article elaborating on the expectations of the United States, claiming that the Soviet Union has decided to adopt an aggressive policy of expansion. If the Soviet Union is allowed to control Europe, the Near East, and the Far East, the security of the American people will be threatened. He pointed out that the United States has committed seven major "mistakes" in post-war world politics: (1) The United States failed to prevent the Chinese civil war, which is currently destroying China and ultimately may cause a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union over interests in the Far East; (2) Before victory, the United States failed to persuade the Allies to reach an agreement on peace issues, especially on the German issue; (3) Failure to use the Lend-Lease Act and military advantages to make the Allies abide by the Atlantic Charter; (4) Failure to agree on a post-war economic recovery plan before victory in Europe; (5) Applying political and economic pressure to other countries in the Western Hemisphere; (6) Failure to consult with France on the German issue; (7) Failure to recognize the great importance of democratic Italy to the American people in a timely manner.

### Winter Relief Organized in a Unified Manner

The Problem of Genuine and Fake Refugees is Serious and Should be Paid Attention To

Mayor Wu Holds Tea Party to Entertain the Press Offers Three Questions to Solicit Opinions

[Our Report] Mayor Wu, for the sake of winter relief matters, invited responsible persons from the city's press to a discussion meeting in the city government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday. More than twenty people attended, including Pan Gongzhan, He Xiya, Zhao Junhao, Zhao Minheng, Luo Dunwei, Wang Yunsheng, Tang Zengyi, Hu Chuanhou, Cheng Wangxi, and Fang Zhichao. The mayor first reported on the progress of the relief efforts, saying: According to the city government's investigation, the total number of refugees in the city is approximately 300,000, of which approximately 50,000 are in real need of relief for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. After the launch of the winter relief donation campaign, it was met with enthusiastic response from all walks of life, with satisfactory results, and the total of 60 billion has reached the target. However, three issues have arisen in the fundraising and refugee reception and handling aspects, and it is planned to ask people in the press to assist with instructions: Fundraising issues: After the launch of the winter relief fundraising campaign, all sectors were motivated by justice and compassion and actively donated, with considerable results. However, the municipal authorities, due to the lack of a unified organization for handling donations and a unified distribution method, are afraid that malpractices will inevitably occur, which should be carefully discussed. Refugee handling issues: According to the city government's analysis of the sources of refugees, the city's refugees can be divided into three categories: one is from war zones such as northern Jiangsu and Anhui, the second is the inherent vagrants and beggars of Shanghai, and the third is scalpers, pickpockets, and petty thieves. On the city government's side, it is planned to implement a work-for-relief method for those refugees who are strong and able to work, ordering them to dredge rivers and providing them with wages of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per day. After the winter, they can obtain travel expenses to return to their hometowns, or they can use it as capital for small businesses. As for the elderly, weak, women, and children among the refugees, shelters will be built to house and care for them. The most difficult to deal with are the scalpers, beggars, and petty thieves, because if they are not taken in, it will have a direct impact on social security and order. If they are given work relief, it is feared that good people will be assimilated by them. According to the city government's original intention, it is planned to house them in vocational training centers, separated from the refugees. Regarding the improvement of reception techniques: According to the city government's investigation results, it was found that a part of the refugees are fake. They have broken into various funeral parlors without authorization and often gather to request relief everywhere. The authorities planned to move them into shelters, but they were refused. Their reason is that "Although they can get warmth after entering the shelter, they lose their freedom." The occurrence of this situation is extremely serious and it is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to it. It is also hoped that the press can provide opinions to improve it and become a model for future relief work.

### Reporters Express Opinions

After the Mayor's speech, Wang Yunsheng, Luo Dunwei, Fang Zhichao and others successively expressed their opinions, generally believing that the citizens are currently enthusiastic about providing relief to refugees, and the authorities must not arbitrarily suppress them. Although a unified method for handling donations is feasible, its effectiveness should be strengthened. "Relief is like fighting a fire," and it should not be delayed due to official procedures.

Finally, Mayor Wu summarized the opinions from the meeting as follows: The winter relief donation will be handled in a unified manner by the Winter Relief Committee. The person in charge of any newly established donation organization should immediately contact the Winter Relief Committee on the third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to receive an official receipt booklet and then solicit donations from the outside world. Any citizen who has a donation receipt will be exempted from donating a second time. Regarding the solicitation of winter clothing, the Winter Relief Committee should also be contacted first, and the committee will discuss with the neighborhood and village leaders in each district to designate areas and distribute winter clothing to avoid the ills of bias and duplication. Regarding refugee handling, it is planned to invite representatives from various charitable organizations such as churches and temples in the city to assist in management. It is also hoped that various newspapers can regularly send reporters to inspect the various shelters and provide opinions and suggestions for improvement as much as possible.

### People's Food Allocation Committee Decides to Reorganize and Expand; Rice Allocation Limited to Employees Paid According to Index

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai People's Food Allocation Committee held its ninth meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, chaired by Director Wu, narrowing the scope to approve 18 entities, including the Workers' Welfare Committee. The method for allocating rice to vocational workers was revised to add the following: "The target of rice allocation is limited to employees who are paid according to the cost of living index and who possess a national identification card," in addition to the original regulations. The application for December rice allocation will close at the end of the month. All rice allocation matters for this year will be completed before January 15th of next year. The price for the second phase of oil distribution per capita will be determined at a price negotiation meeting scheduled for the 29th. In the first phase of oil distribution per capita, there was a distinction between large and small rations, with large rations being one pound and small rations being half a pound. However, there was no survey of large and small rations in each district. Therefore, until the household registration authorities have accurate statistics on large and small rations, starting from the second phase, each person will receive twelve ounces per month, regardless of size. This method will be implemented after approval from the municipal government. The approval of 5,000 dan of rice for the Winter Relief Committee was passed.

### Participation Jointly by Various Agencies

According to Director Wu of the committee, who told reporters: the current organization of the People's Food Allocation Committee is not sound enough, and all problems are impossible to discuss. Rice is managed by the Ministry of Food, coal is managed by the Fuel Management Committee, and oil is the responsibility of the China Trust Bureau. However, the key officials of the Allocation Committee are concurrently appointed by the Social Affairs Bureau, which affects both sides of the work. Next year's work will focus on comprehensive distribution, which concerns five million citizens throughout the city, so it is essential to strengthen the organization. He has decided to resign from this concurrent position. The Economic Reporting Conference and this regular meeting of the Allocation Committee have both approved the reorganization of the People's Food Allocation Committee, requesting the Central Government to send personnel to take charge. Units such as the Central Bank, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Fuel Management Committee, the China Trust Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Government, and the Police Department will participate.

### Movie Theaters Automatically Raise Prices; Wu Kaixian Says, Still Under Consideration

[Our Newspaper Report] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian stated yesterday: the matter of raising movie ticket prices is still under consideration, and it is unlikely to be implemented starting on New Year's Day, as the procedures are not yet complete. As for the statement that movie theater operators have decided to "automatically adjust" ticket prices, it is quite problematic. The Finance Bureau must wait until it receives the Social Affairs Bureau's notice of approved price increases before stamping the entertainment tax seal on the movie tickets. The Social Affairs Bureau's desire to inspect movie theater accounts is not because it suspects them of tax evasion or corruption, but because the reason given by the movie theaters for raising prices is insufficient expenditure. The Social Affairs Bureau wants to understand whether this is indeed the case.

### No Evidence of Abetting Suicide; Zhang Chunfan Declared Not Guilty; Smiles and Deep Bow After Hearing the Verdict

[Our Newspaper Report] In the sensational case of Yue opera actress Xiao Dangui's suicide by taking Lysol, Zhang Chunfan, manager of the Guotai Yue Opera Theater, was accused of abetting suicide. After being prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office, the case was tried twice by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court, and has now concluded. After Judge Mei Erhe ascended to the Criminal Division No. 8 yesterday morning, Zhang Chunfan was brought forward. Zhang wore a Melton woolen coat, a peaked cap, and felt shoes. After confirming his name and origin, Judge Mei stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Zhang Chunfan is not guilty." After the verdict was announced, the reasons were explained. At that time, Zhang smiled after hearing the verdict and bowed deeply to express his gratitude. Zhang's lawyer requested permission for bail, which was granted by the court, ordering Zhang to provide security from two shops, with the security amount being 30 million National Currency. Zhang then left the court. Zhang found security from the Hongchang and Risheng silk shops in the afternoon and was released on bail. The reasons for the verdict of not guilty are briefly stated as follows: The accusation in the indictment that Qian Chunyun said "If you are not feeling well, you can die" during an argument with the defendant was used as a basis for the defendant's prior knowledge of the suicide. The defendant claimed that he had not heard this, and even if it were true, it was nothing more than a rash statement made by Qian during the argument, and it was several days before the suicide. It is difficult to determine from this that the defendant instigated her suicide. Qian's suicide was sudden and unexpected by the defendant. Since the defendant could not foresee the occurrence of the result, he was unable to prevent it, so he should not be held liable for the crimes under Article 15 and Article 275, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. It is clear. Then, what was the cause of Qian's suicide? A comprehensive review of the circumstances of the entire case reveals that Qian repeatedly expressed remorse to the defendant after the incident, hoping to rekindle their old relationship in order to make up for the emotional rift between them. However, the defendant regarded her with indifference, and her melancholy had not dissipated for several days. Moreover, Qian repeatedly planned to go to Hangzhou together to relieve her sorrow, but was unable to do so due to obstacles. On the 13th of the same month, Qian was dressed and ready to depart when she was rejected by the defendant, which led to her feeling of world-weariness. Although the defendant's excessive criticism of others is open to question in terms of morality and justice towards the deceased Qian, after investigation, there is no definite evidence of abetting suicide, and a verdict of not guilty should be announced in accordance with the law. Based on the above conclusions, the judgment should be made as stated in the main text in accordance with Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

It was decided to call on all college and university students in the city to launch a general solicitation during today's weekend holiday, and to print and distribute letters to students and people from all walks of life, appealing to them to intensify the solicitation and enthusiastically donate for the refugees. After the meeting, reporters were invited to report on the significance of the general solicitation, hoping that people from all walks of life would understand and sympathize. The association plans to conduct widespread solicitation in various districts of the city today. The winter clothing, blankets, shoes, socks, etc. that have been solicited by each school but have not yet been issued will also be distributed today at the same time to the refugees who have been surveyed as needing relief. It is expected that a large number of winter clothes will be solicited today, and it is planned to issue them around New Year's Day after several days of sorting.

### Requesting Rice Allocation to Relieve Refugees

In addition to soliciting more than 10,000 pieces of winter clothing, Jiaotong University students have also raised more than 100 million yuan in cash. They specially sent representatives to visit Mayor Wu to request that this cash be allocated to rice to relieve the refugees.

In addition, Fudan, Daxia, Municipal Vocational College, and Art College, etc., continued to solicit donations yesterday with enthusiasm.

Faculty and students of Hujiang University, led by Director Geng, distributed winter clothing and miscellaneous items to the poor people in villages near Yangshupu during the Christmas holiday, benefiting a considerable number of people.

### More Than 400 Students of Daxia Solicited 2,000 Pieces of Winter Clothing

Yesterday, more than 400 students from Daxia University were mobilized to solicit donations in various parts of the city, collecting more than 2,300 pieces of winter clothing throughout the day. Including previous collections, the total is more than 7,000 pieces. 5,000 pieces of winter clothing were issued to refugees in Zhenru and other refugee areas. President Ou of the school expressed his support for the work and encouraged the students to continue their efforts to thoroughly implement the purpose of relieving refugees.

[Another Dispatch] Students of the senior grades of the Mingde Girls' Primary School on Lin Sen Middle Road in this city have voluntarily initiated a campaign to save a week's worth of pocket money to subsidize winter relief, and have collected more than 2 million yuan, which has been handed over to the school to be forwarded to the Winter Relief Committee.

Aurora Organizing Committee

Although Aurora University is in the midst of final exams and busy preparing for classes, it has also actively launched a solicitation campaign. The initiating students are now organizing a solicitation committee, and the school is very sympathetic and provides support for the work. The Dean of Studies advocated a generous donation of 50 million yuan, and the students are also enthusiastically donating. The campaign is currently being expanded.

### To Facilitate the Return of Refugees to Their Native Places, Free Passage on Ships Can Be Provided

In order to facilitate the return of refugees from other places to their native places, the Winter Relief Committee has reached an agreement with the shipping industry to apply to the committee for free passage on ships to return to their native places. In addition, the committee has made 10,000 sets of cotton clothing, which have been manufactured. It is reported that this batch of newly made cotton clothing will be kept in the various cold shelters for refugees to wear, because it has been found in the past that refugees from other places obtained clothing and immediately pawned it.

### Procurement of Goods; Defrauded in Taiwan; Sun Zhidao Arrested and Interrogated

[Our Newspaper Report] Sun Zhidao, 35 years old, a local resident, was arrested for fraud. The victims, Wang Liansheng, Chen Qigeng, and others, accused Sun and his brother Zhixin of jointly defrauding them of 200 million legal tender. It is reported that Wang Liansheng is 52 years old, from Danyang, and lives at 346 Jiangxi Road. Chen Qigeng is 49 years old, from Ningbo, and resides at 20 Shenyuli, Fusheng Road. Both of the above are engaged in the paper box factory business. On the 4th of this month, they went to Taiwan with their friend Ma Hongjin to purchase paperboard. Because they were unfamiliar with the area, they were introduced to the Sun brothers by Ma. On the 12th, they entrusted Sun to introduce them to the Datong Paper Factory in Taipei to order 500 reams of paperboard, stating that each ream would cost 17,000 Taiwan dollars, totaling 8.5 million Taiwan dollars, worth 700 million National Currency. A deposit of 2.4 million Taiwan dollars, worth 200 million National Currency, was required on the spot. Because Wang and others lacked cash, Sun issued a check dated the 15th from the Trust Department of the Taiwan China Southern Bank, with a face value of 2.4 million yuan. Wang et al. then telegraphed the factory in Shanghai for consultation and wrote a note to Huang of the Changxing Public Customs Branch on Xiaoer Road, Keelung, to forward it to Shanghai and instruct them to quickly remit the funds to Taiwan to pay the debt. On the 15th, Wang et al. returned to Shanghai. The funds were remitted to Taiwan on the 17th, but the check issued on the 15th had already been returned. On the 17th, Sun went to Changxing Public Customs and received 2.4 million Taiwan dollars from Cai Zengyu, an employee. Because Cai had dealings with Sun in the past, he did not issue a receipt. After receiving the money, Sun avoided meeting them from then on. On the 20th, he left Taiwan by ship. After arriving in Shanghai on the 23rd, he settled in his concubine's residence on Huanghe Road. Later, the Datong Paper Factory in Taiwan discovered the returned check and found that the remittance had also been claimed. Realizing that something was wrong, they reported it to the Port Police Bureau for record. At the same time, Ma Hongjin telegraphed Shanghai, informing Wang and Chen, who searched for Sun in Shanghai without success. They then reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Sub-Bureau. Section Chief Xu ordered officers Jiang Dafu, employee Ma Jiaju, and police officer Liu Shizhu to Sun's residence on Beikongjia Lane in Nanshi, but they could not be arrested. His younger brother Zhixin then voluntarily surrendered, claiming that it had nothing to do with him. After investigation, it was confirmed that he was innocent and released. Zhixin revealed that his brother Sun Zhidao was hiding in his concubine's residence at 25 Chengxingli, Huanghe Road after returning to Shanghai. The police were dispatched and finally arrested him and brought him to justice. Sun confessed to the fraud. Although Sun had engaged in business between Shanghai and Taiwan, he had no fixed occupation and was fond of gambling, with heavy debts. After defrauding the huge sum of money, he used it all to pay off old debts and gamble. After the sub-bureau completed the investigation, it scheduled to send the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation.

### Gang Police Beaten on Shanyin Road; Wu District Procuratorate Concludes Investigation; Four Law College Students Not Prosecuted

[Our Newspaper Report from Suzhou, 27th] Li Shuxi, Pan Cai, Lin Ziqiu, Gu [illegible]ji and four other students from Shanghai Jiangwan Road Law College participated in the Shanghai student propaganda movement on May 4th of this year. At noon that day, they and more than 100 other students were pasting slogans in front of the Freedom Publishing House at the intersection of Shanyin Road at the end of North Sichuan Road, when they were obstructed by Guo Juxiang, a police officer on duty at that location, resulting in a conflict. The students became agitated and surrounded and beat Guo, injuring him. Li Shuxi and the other four students, because they lingered and did not leave, were sent to the Shanghai High Procuratorate by the Municipal Police Bureau on suspicion of obstructing official duties and assault. The Supreme Court Procuratorate then ordered that they be transferred to the Wu County District Procuratorate for investigation. It is reported that the investigation of the case has now concluded. Based on the police bureau's records at the time of the incident and the testimony of other witnesses at the scene, it could not be determined that the four students had actually participated in the assault, so they were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence of a crime.

### Tax Standard for Specific Industries Determined; Chamber of Commerce Strives Against Further Audits

The Chamber of Commerce believes that since the city's profit tax is processed according to the standard tax system, industries with determined tax standards, excluding those already audited, should uniformly follow the standard tax without further case-by-case audits. They have sent a letter to the Tax Bureau requesting correction, which has been forwarded to the ministry for review.

### Harsh Measures Fail; Soft Tactics Achieve Results: Hong Kong Governor Secretly Arrives in Guangzhou to Seek a "Compromise" for the Demolition Incident

[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou Telegram, 24th] The Guangzhou public has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the Kowloon Walled City incident, urging the Hong Kong government to respect China's sovereignty and not to add another unpleasant page to Sino-British relations amidst China's domestic and foreign troubles. The Hong Kong government recently seemed to have deeply understood the situation. After Guangdong-Guangxi Special Commissioner Guo Dehua brought back new instructions from Nanjing, and after repeated negotiations with the Hong Kong government, the attitude of the Hong Kong government seemed to have begun to change. A few days ago, Hong Kong's Chinese and Western newspapers published a headline announcing that Hong Kong Governor Sir Grantham had taken a weekend trip, but the destination could not be announced. While speculations were rampant in Hong Kong, the Governor quietly ran to Guangzhou to secretly discuss solutions to the Kowloon Walled City incident with Director Song. This information was obtained by a reporter from reliable sources and is highly credible. But why does the Governor have to take such a "secret" trip? According to qualified sources familiar with the style of British people in Hong Kong: British gentlemen never admit mistakes, they just try to evade and find a compromise. This time, the Kowloon Magistracy issued summons to residents of the Kowloon Walled City in a very serious manner. On the day of the trial, not a single resident appeared in court (because they are not subject to British law). The judge probably fainted for a moment and issued a "demolition order." How does the Hong Kong government have the right to demolish civilian houses on the land of the Republic of China? But laws cannot be reversed, and the people of Kowloon Walled City will not give up their houses to others for demolition, especially since this is a diplomatic issue and has nothing to do with the civil law of the Kowloon Magistracy! However, the Hong Kong government recklessly did this simply to "scare" the residents. If the residents were intimidated by its stern demeanor and ran to submit to British law, then things would be much easier. Now that harsh measures have failed, it has to resort to soft tactics. The Governor does not hesitate to run to Guangzhou to meet Director Song to discuss a "compromise" so that the gentleman can step down gracefully. It is said that Director Song has determined that diplomatic negotiations are possible, but sovereignty cannot be lost. He is prepared to settle this fluctuating case with the Hong Kong government and, at the same time, inform the Baoan County government to promptly report the household registration of the Kowloon Walled City (estimated at 135 households, totaling 1687 people) to facilitate the negotiations.

### Hainan Iron Ore Development Imminent

[Our Newspaper's Hainan Island Telegram, 25th] Hainan Island is rich in mineral deposits, which is well-known overseas. When the Japanese invaders occupied Hainan, they paid attention to developing the Shilu and Tiandu mines. After the war, the resumption of operations was not well-handled, resulting in production stagnation and failure to achieve large-scale development. It is now learned that to strengthen national power, the highest authorities have instructed the Executive Yuan's Resources Committee to formulate concrete plans for developing the iron ore in the southern part of the island and implement them step by step. More than 200 engineers and technicians have been dispatched, along with a large number of new mining tools, to Hainan by ship to carry out the mining work. It is also learned that Xiao Mohan, a specialist from the Executive Yuan's Resources Committee's Hainan Iron Ore Preparatory Office, has been assigned to Hainan to plan the mining steps.

### Hainan Pacification Command Headquarters to be Officially Established on New Year's Day; Zhang Beihai Appointed Chairman of Special Party Department

[Our Newspaper's Hainan Island Telegram, 27th] In order to eliminate communist bandits in various places as soon as possible and consolidate public security, the Guangdong Provincial Government has specially divided the entire province into several pacification zones according to administrative divisions, responsible for pacification work. The commanders of the command headquarters in each zone are concurrently held by the commissioners of the respective zones, so as to achieve the effect of military-government unity. Hainan is the ninth administrative district and will also establish the Ninth District Pacification Command Headquarters. The establishment date has been set for New Year's Day.

Another telegram: Hainan Island has a unique geographical environment. The Central Standing Committee has previously approved the organization of the Hainan Special Party Department and appointed Zhang Beihai as the Chairman and Zheng Tianjian as the Secretary-General. Today, a reporter quoted a person in charge of party affairs here, saying: The island is isolated overseas, and due to traffic congestion, it is not easy for party departments in various counties to contact the provincial party department. In order to strengthen the progress of party affairs, a special party department is set up to supervise nearby. Furthermore, there was also a special party department in Hainan Island in the 15th year of the Republic of China. Chairman Zhang, a native of Huiyang, Guangdong, has been handling party affairs for many years and will come south within days. The Special Party Department will also be officially established.

### Suzhou Bank of China Accused of Lax Payment Inspection; 2 Million Yuan Check Altered to 30 Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Suzhou Telegram, 26th] The Suzhou Bank of China has recently been sued by Yang Wenlian, former commander of the 29th Army Officers' Brigade of the Central Training Corps, and Kong Jiesheng, a quartermaster, for negligent payment inspection. It is said that the brigade had issued a check for retirement pay to a retired military officer with a face value of 1.09 million yuan. The payee altered it to 38 million yuan and cashed it at the Bank of China. The bank, in its haste, did not discern the alteration and rashly made the payment. It was not until the recent reconciliation that the error was discovered. The officers' brigade requested the Capital Police Headquarters to send technical personnel to the Wu District Prosecutor's Office to extract the check from the bank.

### Wuxi Yu Zuogang Kills Someone, Implicating Wan Ruilin in Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper's Wuxi Telegram, 26th] During his tenure, former Xiang Xiang Mayor and Self-Defense Team Leader Yu Zuogang abused his power and illegally arrested Sun Jiadao, who sold eye medicine. He tortured him to death, moved the body to the wilderness. At the time, a razor seller witnessed this and informed the corpse's father, Sun Murong, who reported it to the District Prosecutor's Office. An autopsy confirmed that the death was caused by illegal torture. Knowing that things were not good, the criminal Yu fled with his weapon. Later, the security team learned of it and arrested Yu and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office. After the investigation was concluded, he was prosecuted for murder and tried publicly by the Criminal Court. Yu stubbornly denied killing Sun Jiadao, only claiming that he happened to be on leave on the day Sun was killed. He presented the instruction of the former Zhang Jing District Chief You Ruilin approving his leave, stating that Yu was not there at the time. You himself also appeared in court and admitted that he had written the instruction himself, but it was not recorded in the receipt book. Judge Zhao Changnian believed that the testimony of witness You Ruilin was full of loopholes, that he had handled the instruction single-handedly, and that there was obvious suspicion of forgery. He also believed that You colluded with the criminal Yu and committed the crime of perjury. He ordered the two criminals, Yu and You, to be detained together for investigation.

### The Sanyang Class Massacre; The Main Criminal, Li A'mi, Sentenced to Death

[Our Newspaper's Pinghu Telegram, 25th] On December 30, 35th year of Republic, thirteen passengers and boatmen on the Sanyang Class speedboat were collectively murdered by bandits at the Bai Mao Port of the county.

The verdict was announced on the 25th of this month: Li A'mi was sentenced to death for continuous murder. The two bandits, Qian and Li, were jointly guilty of murder, but because the crime was committed before the amnesty period, they were sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. The two bandits, Wang A'shui and Lu A'qi, only admitted to committing crimes in Jinshan County and will be transferred to Jinshan for trial.

### Wu Xing Notorious Bandit Wu Shunfa Surrenders, Attempts to Escape, Shot Dead

### Zhenjiang's Largest Department Store, Xinxin Hosiery Factory, Broken Glass Windows; Six Major Perpetrators Have Been Detained

[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Telegram, 27th] The Xinxin Hosiery Factory on Daxi Road in Zhenjiang is the largest department store in Zhenjiang. Recently, due to excessive inventory, the shortage of funds reached nearly 1.6 billion. The chairman of the industry association was asked to borrow 400 million yuan from the Zhenjiang Syndicate, but it was still not enough. Therefore, they had no choice but to sell some of the inventory back to Shanghai for cash and to promote discounts in order to obtain more cash to get through the New Year. Unexpectedly, this move was resented by other merchants. At about 6 PM this afternoon, people in the same industry suddenly gathered and smashed several large glass windows in front of the store door. Fortunately, the police station in charge sent police to suppress the incident and arrested 28 perpetrators on the spot, took them to the station for questioning, and then released 22 on bail.

### Trip to Southwestern Shandong: Yuncheng, Jining

[Our Newspaper's Jinan Telegram, 24th] Southwestern Shandong has always been a gathering place for "heroes" in Chinese history. The people are strong, martial, and value righteousness. The Liangshan Marsh in "Water Margin" is located in the northeastern part of Yuncheng and in the middle of the Yellow River Canal area. The circumference of the mountain is more than ten miles, and there are many caves in the middle, making it easy to hide. There are three main villages in the mountain, each with more than two hundred households. There is a small adobe house with three rooms, which is said to be the site of the "Hall of Loyalty and Righteousness." Every summer and autumn, the river water rises sharply, and the mountain is surrounded by water. In winter, the water recedes, and the bottom of the river dries up, becoming a piece of yellow sand. According to a person from Yuncheng whom I met on this trip, even during peacetime, Liangshan was a place where "heroes" roamed, and those who had no contact with bandits dared not enter. To this day, Yuncheng still has two sites of the Wulong Courtyard: one is in the southwest corner of the city, which is a puddle; one is two miles south of the city, which is a pile of dirt. It is no longer possible to verify which one is the place where Song Jiang killed Yan Xijiao. However, the people of Yuncheng generally express their displeasure when you mention the Wulong Courtyard, just like calling an old-fashioned Shandong native "Big Brother." Both Yuncheng and Liangshan are still occupied by communist bandits. Yuncheng has fallen nine times.

Jining is located on the bank of the Grand Canal and was originally the economic center of southwestern Shandong. In the past, all the wheat, leather, and other products produced in southwestern Shandong were collected here. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway also built a branch line from here to connect with Yanzhou, so commerce was prosperous, and its importance far exceeded that of Chazhou and above. There is the "Taibai Tower" on the south gate tower, with statues of He Zhizhang and Li Taibai. Since the Song and Ming Dynasties, many famous people have inscribed on it. The "Brush Washing Spring" outside the east gate of the city is also a famous scenic spot. The richest man in the city is Sun Yutang Sauce Garden. The garden was founded in the Ming Dynasty and has lasted for four or five hundred years. It produced a champion in the imperial examination during the Qing Dynasty. It still owns 8,000 large sauce jars, all of which are covered with silk. When the communist bandits besieged Jining this summer, many houses in the southwest gates were destroyed. Although the county seat was preserved, because Jiaxiang, Juye, Chengwu, Dingtao, and other places in southwestern Shandong are still in the hands of bandits, and supplies are blocked by the bandits, the market is depressed and far from what it used to be.

Therefore, there are festivals for industry and commerce, and celebrations for the nation. The purpose is to show the people of the country to carry on the past and open up the future, with good intentions. Now, on the occasion of our country's first Telecommunications Memorial Day, I, Yu Jian, am not talented, and I would like to explain its meaning to highlight the origin of the naming.

Back in the late Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the Qing Dynasty, the court was decadent, and foreign aggression was becoming more urgent. Many gentry officials were accustomed to following conventions and sticking to old ways. Only Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Commerce of the Northern Ocean and Governor-General of Zhili, rejected public opinion and strongly advocated the Self-Strengthening Movement, resolutely adopting Western scientific civilization to promote the New Policies. The telecommunications industry was thus introduced into our country. In the fifth year of Guangxu (1879 AD), Li Hongzhang erected a cable at the Dagu Fort to reach Tianjin to test military communications. In the sixth year, he requested permission to establish the North and South Ocean Telegraph, stipulating that the route would run from Tianjin along the Grand Canal, passing through Ningqing, Jiangpu, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and reaching Shanghai. In the seventh year, the Tianjin-Shanghai Telegraph General Bureau was established in Tianjin, and Sheng Xuanhuai was appointed as the general manager. On the eighth day of the eleventh lunar month of the same year (December 28th), the Tianjin-Shanghai line was completed. Telegraphs were sent and received, and public use was opened. This was the beginning of our country's own telecommunications business.

The importance of telecommunications to a country is like the nervous system to the human body. It occupies an extremely important position in national defense, politics, economy, industry, and culture. Therefore, the length of the telecommunications lines and the quality of the machinery can be used as criteria for inferring the strength of a country and the prosperity of its culture. Looking at the civilized countries of Europe and America, telecommunications lines are like nets, running vertically and horizontally. This is why they can see distant countries as neighbors and connect the whole country as one. Looking back at our country, it also presented a thriving scene in the years before the Anti-Japanese War. Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of the war against Japan, much of the original facilities were damaged. During the Anti-Japanese War, although materials were scarce and equipment was insufficient, it was still able to supply military needs and provide civilian use. After the Yi chiefs surrendered and returned east, the authorities, recognizing the importance of telecommunications construction, devoted themselves to the task. In the past two years, they have worked hard, and the scale has been roughly completed. However, looking to the future, they still feel that the cause is great and the responsibility is heavy.

Recently, the transport authorities, believing that the foundation of telecommunications construction after the war has been established, have expressly stipulated that December 28th of each year, that is, the first day of the development of our country's telecommunications industry, as Telecommunications Memorial Day in order to intensify improvement and generally develop business. Telecommunications agencies in various places are ordered to conduct business reviews on this day to inject encouragement into the commemoration and seek continuous renewal. The meaning is profound and worthy of cherishing. Telecommunications is a tool for public communication. Innovation and improvement rely on the cooperation and guidance of all sectors of society. Now, on the occasion of the first Telecommunications Memorial Day, I respectfully record a few words, hoping to seek advice from the gentlemen of the world!

### The Understanding that the Telecommunications Sector Should Have Regarding Telecommunications Memorial Day

— Zhao Li

Before the War of Resistance, China's telecommunications industry was showing a thriving atmosphere, advancing towards a new path. Significant progress had been made in domestic and international telegraphs, as well as urban and long-distance telephones. If it had not been for the Japanese invaders' insane aggression, all the new facilities and plans for our telecommunications industry could have been completed on schedule by now, and there would certainly have been a new look. Tracing back to the July 7th Incident and the subsequent August 22nd Shanghai Battle, which evolved into the sacred and great full-scale War of Resistance, during this period, telecommunications, being the eyes and ears of the military, had to maintain smooth military communications. Therefore, the responsibilities and work of telecommunications employees suddenly became heavier. Later, as the National Army moved inland and the government relocated westward, telecommunications employees also withdrew with them, and new communication networks were built in the inland provinces to meet military needs. However, during this period, not only was there a lack of equipment and the source of foreign goods cut off, but also the enemy's artillery fire and bombing were fierce. Once built, they were destroyed, and the difficulties and hardships were indescribable. Fortunately, the telecommunications employees, with a spirit of adventure and perseverance, buried themselves in hard work and were able to overcome all difficulties and complete the most arduous mission. Therefore, this period can be called the most difficult and glorious page in the history of telecommunications.

In August of the 34th year [1945], the War of Resistance was won. Because telecommunications is an important tool for transmitting government orders and promoting economic, cultural, industrial, and commercial activities, it was given priority in reconstruction ahead of other industries. In addition to restoring the original telecommunications institutions and communication equipment in the occupied areas, it also took over the telecommunications industry in the Northeast and Taiwan and actively reorganized it. At the same time, the machinery and equipment in major cities with heavy telegraph and telephone traffic were strengthened, and their communication efficiency was improved, striving for rapid and accurate telecommunications and promoting their development. In the past two years, considerable achievements have been made and have been well received by society. However, the replenishment of equipment is still limited, the cultivation of telecommunications talent is still insufficient, and the domestic military operations are still in progress, and the social economy is still showing signs of turbulence. There are still many constraints to implementing comprehensive construction, so that telecommunications facilities have not yet fully kept pace with the advanced era and met the needs of the people, and cannot compete with advanced countries in Europe and America.

The transportation authorities, in order to raise the awareness of telecommunications employees and awaken the attention of the people, specially selected December 28th, the day when commercial telegraphs were first opened sixty-six years ago, as Telecommunications Memorial Day. Today is our first Telecommunications Memorial Day and also a great commemorative day for the telecommunications sector in our country's history. In addition to celebrating and rejoicing, we should be vigilant, make a comprehensive review of the past, and formulate far-reaching plans for the future, so that the people of the whole country can understand the true meaning of the country's emphasis on telecommunications, and then gain the support of the people and jointly build new telecommunications. Every year today, every telecommunications practitioner can review the past, plan for the future, and match it with the spirit of hard work shown during the War of Resistance, and work hard to achieve small success in three years and great success in ten years. The future of telecommunications will be infinitely bright. I would like to encourage my colleagues in the telecommunications sector.

### The Evolution of Submarine Cables within Our Country

— Hua Shijian

Submarine cables are a type of wired telegraph. In their manufacture, copper wire is used as the core, which is covered with a special rubber as insulation, lined with hemp rope, and then wrapped with steel wires as thick as fingers or arms. Placed on the seabed, they are both heavy and strong, stretching for hundreds or thousands of miles. The electric current passes through this innermost copper core, through the vast seabed, to reach the other shore, and is indeed a powerful tool for electrical communication. Before the war, there were two submarine cables between Shanghai and Tianjin in our country, which used high-speed telegraph machines to transmit North China telegrams, which were very beneficial. During the war, they were stolen by the enemy and have not been restored to this day. The evolution of submarine cables within our country is briefly described below: Shanghai-Hong Kong Line: In the tenth year of Tongzhi [1871], the submarine cable of the Danish Great Northern Telegraph Company, from Hong Kong via Xiamen's Gulangyu, was laid to Wusong, Shanghai, 950 nautical miles long. This was the beginning of foreign operation of the telecommunications industry in our country. The company set up an office on the Bund in Shanghai (in the building behind the present-day Bank of Communications) and started business. At first, it only received and sent telegrams in foreign languages, and then it created a four-character code to receive and send telegrams in Chinese (the four-character Chinese telegraph book compiled by the company at that time was different from the current one, so the current telegraph book is also called the "New Telegraph Compilation"). In the same year, the British Great Eastern Telegraph Company also laid a submarine cable from Hong Kong via Chuanshi Mountain in Fuzhou to Baoshan, 924 nautical miles long, and operated with the Great Northern Company. In the twelfth year of Tongzhi, because it was inconvenient to have people deliver telegrams from Wusong and Baoshan to Shanghai, the companies arbitrarily erected land lines to connect with the submarine cables to Shanghai. This matter was protested by our government many times, and it was agreed that the government would prepare a price to recover the poles and wires and lend them to the company for use in order to protect sovereignty. Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu First Line: In the 26th year of Guangxu [1900], during the Boxer Rebellion, the land telegraph poles and wires in North China were destroyed. When the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing, the Great Eastern and Great Northern companies took the opportunity to lay a submarine cable from Dagu near Tianjin to Wusong, with a landing in Yantai in the middle, 729 nautical miles long. Sheng Xuanhuai, the director of telegraph administration, wanted to stop it but could not, so he paid a price of 210,000 pounds of British gold to recover it. At that time, there was no such huge amount of money, so it was agreed that within 30 years, the telegram fees received on the line would be used to repay the principal and interest annually. Before the debt was paid off, the line would be managed by the two companies on behalf of the government. It was not until December 22, 1930, that our country recovered it for self-management. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the War of Resistance broke out, and the line was blocked and impassable, and then stolen by the enemy and moved elsewhere. Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu Second Line: In the 11th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications added the second Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable due to the increase in international and North China telegraph business. It was ordered from the Japanese Furukawa Company and was 720 nautical miles long. It was also stolen and moved by the enemy during the War of Resistance. Xuwen-Haikou Line: In the 34th year of Guangxu [1908], the Telegraph Administration Bureau laid a submarine cable from the coast of Xuwen County, which belongs to the Leizhou Peninsula, across the Qiongzhou Strait to Haikou on Hainan Island, 15 nautical miles long, because Hainan Island was isolated overseas. The project was completed and the news was reported, but it was subsequently blocked and impassable. Chuanshi-Tamsui Line: There was a submarine cable from Chuanshi Mountain in Fuzhou to Tamsui Port in Taipei, which was laid in the 13th year of Guangxu [1887], 117 nautical miles long. At that time, our country had a submarine cable ship named "Feice" converted from a gunboat, specializing in repairing this cable. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 [Year of Jiawu], Taiwan was ceded, and the line was sold to Japan in the 24th year of Guangxu, and the submarine cable ship was abandoned. Yantai-Weihai Line: In the 26th year of Guangxu, the British Great Eastern Company took advantage of the Boxer Rebellion to set up a submarine cable from Yantai to Weihaiwei, 41 nautical miles long. In October 1930, the United Kingdom returned Weihaiwei, and the line was recovered at the same time. Weihaiwei-Liugong Island Line: There were telegraph and telephone submarine cables from Weihaiwei to Liugong Island in the nearby sea, each 2 nautical miles long, which were also laid by the Great Eastern Company in the 26th year of Guangxu. They were recovered at the same time as the Yantai-Weihai Line in 1930. Yantai-Dalian Line: There was a submarine cable from Yantai to Dalian on the Liaodong Peninsula, 90 nautical miles long, which was originally established by Russia. After the Russo-Japanese War in the 31st year of Guangxu [1905], it was occupied by Japan. In the 34th year of Guangxu, it was agreed with Japan that the section of the line 7.5 nautical miles from Yantai would belong to our country. Qingdao-Sasebo Line: In the 23rd year of Guangxu [1897], after Germany occupied Jiaozhou Bay in Shandong, it installed a submarine cable from Qingdao to Yantai. In the 26th year, taking advantage of the Boxer Rebellion, it extended it to Shanghai. In the 3rd year of the Republic, during the First World War, Japan declared war on Germany, captured Qingdao, and seized this line, changing it to run between Qingdao and Sasebo, Japan, 537 nautical miles long. At the Washington Conference in the 10th year of the Republic, after repeated negotiations, it was recovered. At the end of the 13th year, it was agreed to divide the cable in half, totaling 268 nautical miles, and zero, which belonged to our country. The right to receive and send telegrams at the Qingdao end was also recovered by us. Shanghai-Yap Line: In the 30th year of Guangxu [1904], the German-Dutch Telegraph Company installed a submarine cable from Yap Island in the Pacific Ocean (approximately 10 degrees north latitude and 140 degrees east longitude) to Baoshan, landing in Shanghai, 1,777 nautical miles long, and set up a telegraph office at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Sichuan Road. In the 3rd year of the Republic, Japan declared war on Germany, and the Yap section was seized by Japan and moved elsewhere. The Baoshan section was first taken over by the Dutch Consul in Shanghai. After our country declared war on Germany, we repeatedly urged the Dutch Consul to hand it over, but he refused. What our government received was only the building of the German-Hewa Company on Fuzhou Road. The former Shanghai Telegraph Bureau moved into that building from No. 1 Li on the Bund of Fuzhou Road in the 10th year of the Republic and served as the current general business office of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau. Japanese Shanghai-Nagasaki Line: In the 2nd year of the Republic, Japan laid a submarine cable between Nagasaki and Baoshan, 468 nautical miles long, and set up a telegraph office at the corner of Xiye Road and Tiantong Road in Shanghai. It was first named the Japan Post Office and later the Japan Telegraph Office, receiving and sending telegrams between various places in Japan and Shanghai. During the War of Resistance, the Japanese enemy used this cable to transmit military telegrams, which was extremely active. After the 30th year [1941], because the land cable between Shanghai and Songjiang was blocked, telegrams could not be sent. In the autumn of the 34th year [1945], the War of Resistance was won, and the office building was taken over by us, which is now the Coast Radio Station and the branch office of the Telecommunications Bureau. Shanghai-Manila Line: In the 28th year of Guangxu [1902], the American Pacific Submarine Cable Company laid a submarine cable from Manila in the Philippines to Baoshan, 1,264 nautical miles long. In the 29th year, it arbitrarily set up a land line to connect to Shanghai to receive and send Sino-US telegrams. In the 30th year, a contract was signed, allowing it to land, but the land cable was handed over to our country as our country's property. Xiamen-Haiphong Line: In the 26th year of Guangxu, the French Telegraph Company, taking advantage of our rebellion, arbitrarily laid a line from Toulane, Haiphong, to Gulangyu, Xiamen, about 800 nautical miles long, and openly opened an office for business. Repeated negotiations to remove it were ineffective. Later, this cable was blocked and impassable. In the 13th year of the Republic, the French side wanted to sell this broken line to our country, but the request was not granted. Longkou-Dalian Line: In the 3rd year of the Republic, Japan declared war on Germany and captured Qingdao. It then laid a submarine cable from Longkou to Dalian, about 110 miles long. Both ends of this line were within our country's territorial waters. Japan knew that it had violated the agreement, so it removed the line in October of that year. Dalian-Sasebo Line and Dalian-Nagasaki Line: These two lines were previously laid by Japan. With the victory of the War of Resistance, they should be confiscated and returned to us. The above is the general situation of submarine cables within our country. The Great Eastern Company's Saigon-Hong Kong Cable originally landed at Chuanshi Mountain in the middle and was connected to Fuzhou. The Great Northern Company's Wusong-Hong Kong Cable originally landed at Gulangyu in the middle and was connected to Xiamen. According to the old contract provisions, each company could set up offices in Fuzhou, Chuanshi Mountain, Xiamen, and Gulangyu to receive and send telegrams. After the expiration of the contract at the end of 1930, all the telegraph offices set up by the company in the above four places were closed. In May 1933, the Ministry of Communications recovered the right of the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific companies to receive and send submarine cable telegrams in Shanghai. The submarine cable receiving and sending office set up by each company on Edward Road was recovered and reorganized by our country. Shanghai to Wusong and Baoshan is our country's territory. Without our country's permission, submarine cables may not be dragged ashore. The landing rights of each company expired at the end of 1930, and were subsequently extended for 14 years, and expired again at the end of 1944. It is found that once a submarine cable is laid, wind and rain cannot invade it, and raging waves cannot break it. The transmission is stable and secret. Observing that after the outbreak of the War of Resistance in the 26th year, the Japanese invaders, though busy with military affairs, still added many submarine cables in Taiwan, Manila, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Hainan Island, Haiphong, Singapore, Borneo, and the Dutch East Indies. It is enough to show that in addition to wireless telegraphs and land cables, submarine cables still occupy an important position in national defense and commerce. Our country's telecommunications industry has been bound by foreign ropes for a long time. At this time of striving for progress, will readers also be moved in their hearts?

### Looking at Telecommunications Construction from "China's Destiny"

Chairman Chiang instructed in "China's Destiny" that the total workload of telecommunications construction is 9,000,000 telephones, 36,000,000 line-pair kilometers of telecommunications circuits, and 3,000 wireless radio stations. The initial ten-year workload is 2,250,000 telephones, 9,000,000 line-pair kilometers of telecommunications circuits, and 2,000 wireless radio stations, of which telephones are targeted at two per 100 people. Telecommunications circuits include urban telephone circuits, long-distance telephone circuits, and telegraph circuits, each with overhead lines and cables. As for wireless radio stations, they are used for communication. The initial ten years must be used as much as possible, so the completion is particularly high. (All)

### A Historical Account of China's Telecommunications Industry

— Zhang Jiayu

(1) Wired Telegraph

Wired telegraphy was established the earliest. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods (approximately 1861-1874 AD), the Qing court prepared to erect poles and wires to test telegraphy. However, at that time, the people's intelligence was not developed, and farmers in various places, seeing that erecting telegraph poles would destroy their land and ancestral graves, rose up to destroy them, and the project could not proceed. It was not until 1879 AD (5th year of Guangxu) that Li Hongzhang tentatively set up military telegraph wires between Tianjin and Dagu with remarkable results, and only then was he granted permission to erect the North-South Ocean Telegraph wires from Tianjin along the Haihe River to Shanghai, and commercial telegrams began to be received and sent on December 28, 1881 AD.

As mentioned above, wired telegraphs encountered destruction by farmers in the gestation period. After its birth, from the end of the Qing Dynasty to the success of the Northern Expedition, there were revolutionary uprisings in the front and warlord civil wars in the back, and destruction was encountered at any time. Only in the short ten years from the establishment of the National Government in 1927 to the outbreak of the War of Resistance in 1937 was the situation relatively stable, and there was an opportunity for active construction. During the War of Resistance, the areas along the Yangtze River and the coast were successively occupied, and the loss of wires and equipment was extremely large. Until today, two years after the war, except for the lines in the southwest, which increased due to wartime construction, the restored areas not only have not recovered, but some areas continue to be destroyed by war.

(2) Wired Telephone

Our country's self-operated urban telephone service began in 1900 when the Nanjing Telegraph Bureau also operated urban telephone services. At that time, there were only 14 telephone subscribers in the entire city, which were exclusively for official use. Later, equipment was added to also provide civilian use and gradually expanded to major cities. After 1927, development was particularly rapid. All urban telephones in major cities mostly switched to automatic telephones. By 1936, the total capacity of telephones managed by the national government reached more than 70,000. Long-distance telephones had also completed the nine-province communication network. During the war, telephone equipment was heavy and difficult to transport, and the losses were severe. Active restoration after the war has achieved good results. According to statistics at the end of June 1947, the current total capacity of urban telephones managed by the national government has reached more than 167,000, more than double the pre-war number. Long-distance telephones have also reached the entire country.

(3) Wireless Telegraph

As early as 1905 AD, our country had begun to test wireless telegraphy, but the initial results were not significant and were only for military use. After the National Government established its capital in 1927, the Ministry of Communications and the Construction Committee competed to set up shortwave radio stations in various places, and wireless telegraphy began to be used for commercial purposes. After ten years of hard work, the progress was rapid, especially since the application of automatic machines to wireless communication, the efficiency has been strengthened. During the war, wired telegraphs were frequently destroyed, and long-distance communication in the rear almost entirely relied on wireless communication. This phenomenon has not changed until now.

Our country's various telecommunications constructions generally began in the political center area, but international wireless communication was first established outside the customs. In 1927, when Zhang Zuolin ruled the three northeastern provinces, he established a large-power radio station in Shenyang to communicate with Germany and France. At that time, telegrams sent from various places within the customs to foreign countries had to be transshipped through Luoyang. As for the International Wireless Radio Station, it began to be established in 1928 (1928 AD). At that time, the wireless communication business was still managed by the Ministry of Communications and the Construction Committee. The two sides simultaneously planned to establish international radio stations. Later, the Transportation Construction was merged, the authority was concentrated, and the progress was accelerated. The large-scale International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications was officially opened on December 6, 1930, and had already begun to communicate with Manila before the opening. As of now, the International Radio Station has more than 20 transceivers, and the total power of the industry is 400 kilowatts. There are currently 22 direct international communication circuits and one international telephone circuit. The amount is close and is being used to replace telex and multiplex telegraph equipment in various major circuits. The former can ensure the absolute accuracy of telegram transmission, and the latter can increase the transmission rate by four times and ensure confidentiality.

(4) Wireless Telephone

Before the war, wireless telephone services had been opened for domestic Shanghai-Guangzhou, Shanghai-Hankou, and international Sino-Japanese and Sino-US wireless telephone services. After the war, the international Sino-US wireless telephone has been restored on one route, and Sino-British calls will also be opened in early 1948. As for domestic long-distance calls, wireless telephone circuits have been used.

### Government Yuan Has New Regulations on Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Students

[This newspaper's report] Regarding self-funded students applying for foreign exchange, the Executive Yuan previously announced the "Regulations on Foreign Exchange Settlement for Publicly and Self-Funded Students," which stipulates that self-funded students who pass the Ministry of Education's examination, scholarship students approved by the Ministry of Education to study abroad, researchers approved by the Ministry of Education who have obtained foreign scholarships to study abroad, and personnel hired to teach abroad can all settle foreign exchange at the official rate. In addition, self-funded students who have been studying at foreign universities without the approval of the Ministry of Education can settle at the market rate. Recently, the Executive Yuan has issued two new regulations, instructing the Central Bank: All self-funded students who have gone abroad with the approval of the "Chairman" and "approved by the Ministry of Education before October 24th of this year after passing the Zhu Jing examination" can also settle foreign exchange at the market rate, and the Central Bank has successively sent letters to designated banks to inform them. It is heard that if the applicant can prove which category of student the beneficiary belongs to within the regulations and attach the Ministry of Education's documents and other documents required in accordance with the regulations, the bank can avoid the trouble of returning and inquiring and can obtain rapid processing.

### Education Statistics for Hainan Island: Number of Schools Reaches 2,000

[Our Newspaper Haikou, Hainan Island, 27th (Airmail)] Education on Hainan Island was quite developed before the war. The education in Wenchang County ranked fourth in Guangdong Province. However, after the island was occupied by the Japanese invaders, most schools were unwilling to implement enslavement education under the enemy's iron hooves. They stopped operating or relocated to other places, resulting in many educational venues being occupied and destroyed by the Japanese enemy, severely damaging the education sector. Since the victory, education has recovered, and the relocated schools have resumed classes one after another. Those that had stopped operating have also gradually reopened, and there are many new schools this autumn. According to recent statistics, there are a total of 32 middle and upper schools on the island, with approximately 10,000 students; approximately 300 central national schools, with approximately 50,000 students; approximately 2,000 guaranteed national schools, with approximately 130,000 students; and approximately 500 other private elementary schools, with approximately 40,000 students. According to people in the education sector, the quantity of education on the island is increasing daily, but the quality has not yet improved. The academic level of students nationwide has generally declined after the war, and Hainan Island is no exception.

### Hualiao Narrowly Escapes Mishap, Defeats Chengyou by One Point, Women's Team Frontline Loses to Qianghua

[Our Newspaper Report] In last night's basketball league, the A-team game saw the ever-victorious Hualiao almost suffer a mishap due to incomplete personnel, narrowly defeated by Chengyou, which can be considered an upset. After a hard fight, they only won by a one-point difference of 52-51. In the first half, 24-23, Hualiao also only led by one point. Chengyou's performance was quite excellent.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee Holds Extraordinary Meeting Yesterday, New Agency Established on January 1st and Opens for Business on January 2nd

[Our Newspaper Report] The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee held an extraordinary committee meeting yesterday at 3 PM, chaired by Chairman Yuan Liang. Vice Chairman Liu Siying, committee members Liu Gongyun, Zhang Xuan, Hu Jingliang, Wang Lanseng, Liu Wen and directors Duan Xuan, Li Yuanding, Gao Bingtai, and Chen Shuhui were present. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs also attended and gave instructions. Minister Chen delivered a speech, stating that the committee's task was arduous, and that the past work of the Textile Adjustment Committee had mostly failed. He said that官商 cooperation should be promoted in the future to run the committee well. Chairman Yuan then delivered a speech, mainly focusing on three points: 1. If administrative power can be effectively implemented, the cotton yarn and cloth management methods will be successfully implemented. 2. Malpractice always originates from people, so in the future, the selection of personnel should be extremely cautious and select the best talents. 3. While implementing management for manufacturers, they should also be supported so that they are willing to be managed. He also reported on three points: 1. The official seal of the new agency has been issued. 2. The new agency will be established on January 1st and will open for business on January 2nd. 3. Personnel below the director level are being selected. Finally, the committee members exchanged opinions on the cotton yarn and cloth management methods.

[Another Report] The Yarn Management Committee will hold two regular committee meetings every month, scheduled for 3 PM on the first and fourth Saturdays of each month.

Strengthen Inspection Work to Cooperate with the Policy of Unified Purchase and Sale

[Our Newspaper Report] The tenth meeting of the Agricultural and Forestry Department's Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee was held at the Textile Construction Company yesterday at 4 PM, chaired by Zhou Changyun. The important agenda items were: (1) Inspection of cotton should be strengthened to cooperate with the unified purchase and sale policy. The committee is requested to allocate 12 billion yuan for the annual inspection expenses and also recommends that during the inspection, cargo owners voluntarily donate some fees. (2) In the past, the promotion of ramie in Hangzhou was solely funded by Textile Construction. The committee is now requested to allocate a portion of the Cotton Production Improvement Fund, and a promotional budget of 9.8 billion yuan should also be prepared, and the government is requested to raise funds. (3) The purpose of purchasing improved cotton seeds this year is for 250,000 seeds, which can be planted next year to produce 3 million mu of improved cotton, which can produce 1 million dan of improved cotton.

Textile Construction Opens Board of Directors Meeting to Decide Future Business Direction

[Our Newspaper Report] The China Textile Construction Company convened a board of directors meeting yesterday morning at 10 AM, chaired by Chairman Chen Qitian. The meeting lasted until 2 PM. The main points are as follows:

Reported Matters: (1) The total annual production volume of all factories under Textile Construction this year is estimated at 742,000 bales of cotton yarn, 15,948,000 pieces of cotton cloth, 2,058,000 yards of wool fabrics, 2,576,000 pounds of wool yarn, 8,544,100 yards of hemp, 4,885,000 yards of hemp bags, 515,000 pounds of silk, 1,697,000 yards of silk fabrics, 32,600 pieces of knitted underwear, 786,000 pieces of clothing, 3,400 ribbing pieces, 4,541,000 pieces of dyed and finished fabrics, and 198,000 pounds of yarn. (2) Exports from June of this year to date are valued at US$3,986,877, £2,020,206, $1,219,540, and Rs. 413,930, for a total value of US$14,155,525. (3) Losses of cotton stockpiles in various places, including Shijiazhuang, Longhai Road, and Northeast China, are valued at 500 billion yuan. (4) Total donations to the outside world for the year, including military apportionments of over 90 billion yuan and ordinary donations of 10 billion yuan.

Matters for Discussion: (1) Factories in Qingdao have suspended work due to a shortage of coal. The Shanghai Fuel Management Committee has agreed to allocate 3,000 tons first, and Qinhuangdao can also send 2,000 tons. The company has collected 1,700 tons in Shanghai, so it can temporarily support operations in the short term. As for exchanging yarn for coal from India, the board members agreed that it is better to exchange yarn for coal than to suffer losses from suspension of work. It was decided that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Transport Management Committee should be consulted. (2) The company can consider accepting the commission from the Yarn Management Committee for purchasing and distribution. However, it is only a commercial agency and does not bear any administrative responsibility. (3) The company's cotton yarn listing has two types: negotiated prices and stock market prices, which are quite inconsistent. It was decided to determine how to proceed after the implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy. (4) The company faced three major difficulties this year: (A) Military debt, (B) National Bank's entrusted spinning, (C) Losses from negotiated prices. As a result, although the company nominally had a profit of 1 trillion yuan this year, the material stock was actually reduced. For example, cotton was reduced by more than 500,000 dan compared to last year. Now that the policy of unified purchase and sale is implemented, the actual profit will be even less. It is hoped that the government will not have excessive expectations of the company when preparing the budget next year.

### Many Close Out Speculative Positions, Hua Shares Show Weakness Near Closing

The Hua shares fluctuated unpredictably yesterday due to conflicting rumors. The general participants felt at a crossroads, and although the shorts had made up for their positions outside the market, the impact was minimal due to most closing out speculative positions. The occasional upward movements lacked momentum, and the market ended on a weak note near closing. The situation of small-cap stocks improved slightly compared to the previous day.

Initially, rumors that transactions could not be completed before the New Year had a negative impact, and the market opened with a sharp decline. Yong Yarn opened at 537 yuan and 535 yuan, showing an inverted price curve. Immediate delivery shares once fell to 535 yuan, then rose to 547 yuan, the same price as current delivery, showing a slight rebound. Spot prices outside the market opened low at 0.18 yuan and 0.225 yuan, once rising to high prices of 552 yuan for immediate delivery and 557 yuan for future delivery. Then, they gradually declined to within 540 yuan. As a result, strong buyers of immediate and future delivery shares rallied to around 545 yuan. However, the gains were not sustained, and the prices fell to low prices of 532 yuan for immediate delivery and 534 yuan for future delivery. The closing price for the morning was 536 yuan and 539 yuan. Yonggong and other small-cap stocks were relatively stable. China Mud had few transactions and closed at a low price. As a result, compared to the previous day's immediate delivery shares, Xinhua Wuhe and Datong were still flat. China mud fell by 10%, Yongye rose by 0.5%, and Yong Yarn, Zhabei, Xinnuo, Meiya, Jingfu, China-France, Underwear, Matches, Business, and Tongyi were slightly lower. The future delivery shares fell by about half a yuan, and the rest fell slightly.

### National Bonds Average, Foreign Stocks Hover

Government bonds averaged and changed little yesterday. Tongbing opened at 30,700 yuan and immediately fell to 29,400 yuan before rebounding to hover outside the 30,000 yuan mark. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, A, B, and D were flat, C fell by 400 yuan, and E fell by 300 yuan. The total volume was less than 3 million.

Foreign stocks also only hovered yesterday. Yisha opened at 423,000 yuan. The highest price was no more than 426,000 yuan, and the lowest price was only 416,000 yuan, before closing with a hovering posture. Banks and foreign firms bought, while Guangdong firms and retail investors sold. As a result, compared to the previous close, British Federal Shipping, Tram, and Xiangtai were all flat, Ken Zhi fell by 0.5%, and the remaining shares were slightly up or down.

### Yarn and Cloth Flat and Weak

The cotton yarn market was still firm at the morning opening yesterday. Later, it was rumored that private yarn factories would sell off their stocks in large quantities, and market sentiment suddenly turned weak. Moreover, as the holidays were approaching, few traders and brokers were active, and transactions were quite light. In the market, only some bargain hunting occurred. For the whole day, 42-count Baoguang yarn from replica factories was in demand, and 16-count Guangming Tiannu coarse yarn was purchased by brokers, and prices rose by 100,000 yuan. The supply and demand for 42-count Blue Phoenix and Jincheng were equal, and prices remained unchanged. In addition, the prices of most coarse and fine yarns fell by 100,000 to 700,000 or 800,000 yuan.

Due to the approaching Gregorian New Year and tight credit, many traders were selling cotton cloth. Moreover, with the imminent implementation of the unified purchase and sale method, the market was likely to stabilize, and market sentiment was scattered. Buyers were all engaged in resale activities, and it was also reported that dyeing factories needed cash and had sold off large quantities of spot goods. Moreover, Textile Construction Company was about to open for cloth allocation, and the quota was abundant. Shanxi traders were short on cash and dumped a lot of spot goods. The market was shrouded in a bearish atmosphere, and prices fell in a straight line. Finally, the spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth outside the market fell by 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day, and the prices of other grades of fine cloth also fell by 15,000 to 23,000 yuan. The overall trend was that Jumping Carp bleached cloth was in demand by Hankou traders, rising by 20,000 yuan, and Grey Light was slightly absorbed by umbrella factories, while the atmosphere in other cloth markets was clearly weak.

### Stable Money Market

[Our Newspaper Report] Due to the large inflow of cash into Shanghai yesterday, the money market was stable, with a hidden rate of around 0.24. The net difference between the Four Banks and Two Bureaus was 145.5 billion, with the Central Bank receiving 98.3 billion, the Large Exchange issuing 27.4 billion, foreign firms receiving 11.9 billion, the Small Exchange issuing 13 billion, the China Bank receiving 36.4 billion, the Jiaotong Bank issuing 19.8 billion, the China Agricultural Bank receiving 13.8 billion, and the China Trust Bureau issuing 8.197 billion.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Formulates Payment Methods for Privately-Owned Industries Purchasing Japanese Reparation Goods

[Our Newspaper Report] The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently formulated payment methods for privately-owned industries purchasing Japanese reparation goods and has notified factories in various places through the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office. The methods stipulate that any factory applying to purchase reparation goods should sign a contract for delivery and payment with the Ministry of Economic Affairs upon approval of the purchase. If the price of the goods being purchased has been assessed, it should be handled in accordance with Article 6 of the Executive Yuan's published methods for private enterprises applying to purchase Japanese reparation goods. If the valuation of the goods is still preliminary, a deposit of 5% of the estimated price should be paid first. If the goods are being shipped from Japanese ports and have not yet arrived at Chinese ports, 15% of the preliminary estimated price should be paid. If all the goods have arrived, the 15% of the value should be paid at the same time as the deposit. The remaining 65% of the payment will be allowed to be paid off in two years. All prices are calculated in US dollars. However, privately-owned enterprises that purchase the goods can pay in national currency at the central bank's market price at the time of each payment. The shipping costs must be paid in full by the purchaser at one time.

### Artificial Silk Prices Rise; Factory-Processed Plain Silk Goods Fall

The price of artificial silk on the market yesterday rose slightly again. This was because the Central Trust Bureau would stop allocating the first phase of goods next week, which calmed people's hearts somewhat. No. 120, brand "Xu," grade 1A, lustrous, opened in the morning at 79 million yuan and closed at 80 million yuan for spot prices. The Monday futures traded in the morning at 81.5 to 81.6 million yuan, but softened in the afternoon, dropping to 81 million yuan. Later, it even fell to 80.5 million yuan, resulting in an increase of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Factory-Processed Silk

The market was quiet yesterday, and prices remained relatively stable. CD grade was quoted at around 86 to 87 million yuan, with higher qualities carrying an additional premium of around 5 million yuan, and mid-grade qualities carrying an additional premium of around 3 million yuan, similar to the previous day. Transactions of dried silk were also scarce, and market prices remained unchanged.

Silk Goods

Yesterday on the market, silk quilt covers declined in price. Goods from the Huaqiang brand remained firm at the opening, around 53 to 54 million yuan. Due to uneven supply and demand, quoted prices gradually decreased, with spot prices at the close at 47 million yuan, down 5 million yuan from the previous day, and Monday futures at 51 million yuan. Dachen checkered cloth followed, down 2,000 yuan, to 135,000 yuan. For other goods, factory prices remained firm.

### Rice Market Firm; Oil Prices Soar

Yesterday, the total volume of grain in the North and South markets was over 15,100 *shi*. The South market initially rose but later weakened, resulting in no gains or losses for *japonica* and *indica* rice. High-quality *baiyuan* rice was in demand, while lower-quality rice was stagnant. The situation for *yinyuan* rice was similar. The North market was sluggish and weak. Flour rose again to the limit, and bran continued to advance rapidly towards a peak. Sales of bean cake remained weak, but raw materials were expensive, so sellers remained firm. The soybean market was quiet for out-of-town buyers, and local trading was slow, but oil mills continued to absorb large quantities, and demand was brisk. Reports of price increases from inland areas strengthened buyers' confidence. *Du huang* soybeans rose again by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and Central China soybeans rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. *Lvdou* mung beans saw slight imports from Southeast Asia, rising by over 10,000 yuan, and red beans rose slightly by 10,000 yuan. Sales of white beans were average, causing a rise of 10,000 yuan, and cowpeas followed, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Retailers purchased red sorghum, and demand from distilleries was not weak, leading to a surge of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Corn sales to northern areas turned sluggish, falling back by 10,000 yuan. Groundnuts were being actively sought after by both local and out-of-town buyers, rising steadily, up another 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.

Shantou relied on Ningbo merchants, and Tianjin also got involved, sending prices soaring. Various oils successively rose by varying amounts from over 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, with a slight softening seen near the close.

### Shortages During Cargo Collection at the Wharf Should Be Reported to Customs Inspectors

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that when merchants collect cargo at the wharf, they should first carefully inspect the goods they are collecting. If any shortages are discovered, they should report them to the customs inspectors stationed at the wharf before the goods are completely removed. After verification by the inspectors, they should be noted on the release form for verification. It is stipulated that from January 1, 1948, if a merchant encounters a shortage of goods but does not report it to the customs officer on-site at the time of collection and have it certified, the customs will not recognize the short-landing situation since it cannot be determined. The merchant may not make any claims to the customs afterward.

Textile Construction Company Cloth Sales

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 11,380 bolts with 316 application forms. Seven forms were from manufacturers, purchasing 840 bolts, and 309 forms were cloth numbers, purchasing 10,540 bolts.

Overcoat Fabric Sales Stagnant

In the wool market, thin fabrics continued to be preferred. Apart from flannelette, thicker fabrics such as overcoat fabric, plain thick fabric, and Melton cloth all declined in sales and price. Although the weather is severely cold, and it is the right time for overcoat fabric to sell well, most people want to sell their existing stock. Local buyers have no intention of adding more in advance. Moreover, since Christmas has passed, most retail sales have already occurred. Generally, 70% to 80% of customers have already ordered and prepared their winter clothes. Therefore, there are only scattered small sales, and there are no original bolt or full-box transactions.

### Qimen Tea Sales Active

The tea market has not yet entered a lively state due to the supply and demand situation, resulting in unremarkable transactions. The process remains quiet with little activity. According to industry insiders, local shops and stores still have a strong desire for this year's special Qimen tea. However, the market supply of this type of tea is scarce, so it is in short supply. It is predicted that the selling price may continue to increase.

### China Trust Foreign Trade Office Explains Sino-Japanese Trade

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a person in charge of the China Trust Foreign Trade Office, Japanese goods are still arriving continuously. Today, a batch of railway ties arrived in Shanghai. Currently, among the countries trading with Japan, except for the United States, countries such as Britain and Australia all have overdrafts, and China is not alone in this. Moreover, China's overdraft amount is not the largest among the Allied nations. There are two reasons for the overdraft: first, it was originally planned to ship one million tons of salt to Japan this year, but due to prioritizing domestic sales, only 200,000 tons were actually used for trade; second, the original iron sand shipment to Japan was later handled by the Resources Committee to obtain foreign exchange, so this batch of iron sand was sold to Britain instead. Due to economic difficulties on both sides, the volume of Sino-Japanese trade next year is not expected to increase significantly. The Chinese side hopes to import from Japan not only transportation and industrial and mining equipment but also artificial silk. China's exports will still mainly be...[gap in text]. It is possible that there will be some iron sand. As for combined sugar soybeans, it is still hoped that surplus products can be exported, but only on the condition of obtaining cash. This year's export revenue for Taiwan sugar was five million US dollars, and for soybeans, it was one million US dollars. It is hoped that it can be further increased next year.

### Three Martyrs of the 29th Army: Memories of Short Eaves, Part 3

At the end of July 1937, Song Zheyuan led his troops to retreat, and Beiping fell to the enemy. Although the Japanese army did not enter the city that day, the atmosphere was filled with sorrow and gloom, and the world seemed to change color. The people of the old capital admired the two generals, Zhao Dengyu and Tong Linge, who died in battle in Nanyuan, and ridiculed General Zhang Zizhong, who succeeded Song as the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. It was said that Song Zheyuan had left, Zhao Dengyu had died, and Zhang Zizhong had surrendered. All three were mainstays of the 29th Army, yet they were judged differently, which some called strange.

Zhang Zizhong took office for only a few days before leaving Beiping to participate in the war of resistance. He later died in battle in Hubei, a martyred hero, and his intentions became clear. Song Zheyuan also fought tirelessly and died in western Sichuan. After the victory, in the Martyrs' Shrine at Babaoshan in western Beijing, the spirit tablets of Zhang, Tong, and Zhao were placed in the highest position first. Incense was offered, and they were worshiped by thousands of people. Babaoshan was previously the place where the Japanese worshiped their so-called "loyal spirits," and the immediate retribution was especially gratifying.

After the entire 29th Army retreated, the Japanese selected the city and reluctantly supported it through the so-called "Local Maintenance Association." By the end of the year, the puppet "Provisional Government" suddenly appeared, and the names of the key figures in its organization belonged to the "Qiyang rhyme": Wang Kemin, Wang Yitang, Tang Erhe, Wang Shijing, and later Wang Yintai was added. The three "Wangs" took turns serving as the "Chairman of the North China Committee," and people called this puppet organization the "Wang Family Old Shop." In the south of the Yangtze River, Liang (Hongzhi), the head of the puppet "Reformed Government," also had the Qiyang rhyme, and Wang (Zhaoming), the head of the puppet "National Government," also had the Qiyang rhyme. It can be said that "coincidence is stranger than fiction."

### Strange People and Strange Things

— Wen Ji

A certain person A attempted suicide by drowning. A policeman saw him and threw him a rope, telling him to climb ashore. However, he was determined to die and refused to grab the rope. The policeman became angry and threatened to shoot him dead. Only then did person A obey and climb ashore.

One day, a night newspaper published two news items. One was about a millionaire who committed suicide because of business failure and only had 25,000 yuan left. The other was about a coolie who won the lottery's first prize, receiving 25,000 yuan. Overjoyed, he bought wine and celebrated wildly. However, he got drunk and accidentally died.

Helen Keller, one of the seven wonders of the world, a blind, deaf, and mute American woman, once went to England and met George Bernard Shaw, a strange man from England, with Mrs. Estes. The following conversation took place:

Helen Keller said: "I am very happy to meet you. I have long wanted to know you."

George Bernard Shaw retorted: "Why do all Americans say the same thing?"

Helen Keller said: "Why do you hate us Americans so much?"

George Bernard Shaw replied: "I don't hate you." His tone implied that Americans were not worth his hatred.

Helen Keller asked: "Then why don't you go to America?"

"Why should I go to America? All the Americans will come to see me."

Mrs. Estes put her hand on Shaw's arm and pushed him, as if he were a child behaving badly in front of guests. She said to Shaw: "Don't you know who this is? This is Helen Keller. She is deaf and blind."

His answer must have greatly surprised everyone present, but Helen Keller did not immediately know what he said because the interpreter's sign language suddenly stopped. She waited suspiciously. After a while, the interpreter told her in sign language what Shaw said.

"What's so strange about that! All Americans are deaf, blind—and mute."

### Tolerance

— Yi Feng

Jesus said: "If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to him as well." This is how Christians teach people to be "tolerant and generous." Although such things may not necessarily happen in the world, widening the scope of tolerance and being able to forgive others is, after all, a virtue.

In the East, especially in our country, which emphasizes the golden mean and the principle of reciprocity, people admire those with great magnanimity and tirelessly encourage others to be more tolerant. For example, people often use the warning "A small impatience can ruin great plans" to play the role of peacemaker, hoping that people will not get trapped in narrow-mindedness and emotional impulses, leading to self-suffering and disturbance in narrow spaces. There is also a saying that is easier for people to understand and digest, which is "A prime minister's belly can hold a boat." It does not say "A scholar's belly can hold a boat," but specifically mentions the "prime minister," who in the era of autocracy was a great figure "below one person and above ten thousand," naturally because of this.

Precisely because "a prime minister's belly can hold a boat," there were indeed many great figures in ancient times who were admired for their "magnanimity." Let me just give one or two examples: one is Guo Ziyi, a famous general of the Tang Dynasty, and the other is Wang Dan, a Grand Commandant of the early Song Dynasty. Both are the best examples:

According to historical records, when Duke (Guo Ziyi) entered the court, Yu Chaoen invited him to visit Zhangjing Temple. Yuan Zai, fearing that they would form an alliance, secretly told Duke Guo: "Chaoen is plotting against you." Duke Guo did not listen. His generals requested that armored soldiers accompany him, but Duke Guo said: "I am a minister of the country. He does not have the Emperor's authority, how dare he harm me? If he comes under orders, what do you want to do?" So he urged a few servants to go. Chaoen was surprised and asked the reason. Duke Guo told him what he had heard and said: "I am afraid I have troubled you." Chaoen stroked Duke Guo's face and wept, saying: "If it were not for your generosity, how could I not be suspicious?" Duke Guo was in the midst of petty people fighting around him, and yet he was able to remain calm. How could this be achieved without great magnanimity?

According to the Houde Lu, Grand Commandant Wang Dan recommended Kou Zhun as prime minister. Prime Minister Kou often criticized Grand Commandant Wang to the Emperor, but Grand Commandant Wang always praised Kou's strengths. One day, the Emperor said to Grand Commandant Wang: "Although you praise his virtues, he only talks about your faults." Grand Commandant Wang replied: "It is only natural. I have been in office for a long time, and there must be many shortcomings in my handling of political affairs. Kou Zhun does not hide anything from Your Majesty, which is enough to show his loyalty and uprightness. This is why I value Kou Zhun." When Kou Zhun was a regional military commissioner, he once held a large banquet on his birthday and used extravagant clothes, which was reported by someone. The Emperor was very angry and said to Grand Commandant Wang: "Kou Zhun wants to imitate Me in everything. Is that permissible?" Grand Commandant Wang slowly replied: "Kou Zhun is indeed a capable minister, but he is just a bit silly!" The Emperor's anger subsided. This Grand Commandant Wang's magnanimity can also be considered extreme.

Both of these stories are quite touching. However, it also makes us realize that for a person to be magnanimous, they must have two basic conditions: one is that their thoughts must be broad-minded and their mind must be deep, as in Duke Guo's explanation to his generals and Wang Dan's unwillingness to argue with Kou Zhun. The other is that they must have an extremely rich sense of humor, such as the former's "I am afraid I have troubled you" and the latter's "but he is just a bit silly!" Only in this way can one be calm and accept unpleasant words, and even if they encounter extremely difficult situations, they can laugh it off. Otherwise, it cannot be considered magnanimity.

### Roadside Goose, Frozen to Death Bones

— Wen Jie

Speaking of this year's summer being particularly hot, I remember one day when the scorching sun was blazing and the asphalt road felt sticky, I saw a beggar boy lying in the shade of a utility pole by the roadside, trying to avoid the direct power of the scorching sun. The shadow moved with the sun, so this beggar boy had to move his throne every few minutes in order to get the benefit of the shadow, even if it was limited. These kinds of beggar boys probably only have a shadow left to protect them in the sea of people—to put it "elegantly," this can also be considered summer heat relief.

Let's talk about the climate, which is also like a movie. With a change of camera angle, it is instantly switched to the severe winter with howling winds and breath turning into ice. It is said that there is a wooden house like a wardrobe in my yard. In terms of shape and size, it is a wardrobe, but it houses a family, so it can only be called a "house." It is also divided into upper and lower layers. The lower layer is used to store things. One day, I was walking home at night and passed this wooden house when I heard the voice of a child inside saying, "It's cold!" His mother replied, "Then let's hug each other and sleep." The child asked, "Mom, when can we move back into the house?" "Are you talking about moving into the house that is being built?" "When will that house be built?" This "family" can actually be considered "better off than some."

Let's talk about one bitterly cold day, I saw a so-called "bum" on the street. He was disheveled, covered in dirt, and as thin as firewood. He walked like an automatic piece of wood, wearing only an old and dirty undershirt on his upper body and a pair of torn shorts that couldn't even cover his buttocks on his lower body. His body was very thin, a so-called "willow waist," and his limbs were like tree branches. It was truly unexpected that a person could be so thin and shriveled. He looked like a narrow person reflected in a funhouse mirror. The saying "as thin as a rake" finally felt believable. He dragged himself barefoot in the cold wind, his eyes fixed, not paying attention to anything around him. He was truly a walking stick that deserved the name. This person probably truly "puts life and death out of mind." He no longer had hope, no longer had thoughts, and no longer cared about anything. Everything that makes a person a person had been extinguished, leaving only the simplest biological movements. If someone hit him, he would never fight back, just drag his feet and run away. If someone chased him, he would just walk faster. If people stopped chasing him, he would drag his feet as before, his eyes fixed, and not care about anything around him. If there was anything edible on the street, like vegetable leaves, he would pick it up and eat it. When he needed to defecate, he would defecate. When he needed to sleep, he would find a place to sleep and lie down anywhere—everything that makes a person a person had been extinguished, leaving only the simplest biological movements. If someone hit him, he would never fight back, just drag his feet and run away. If someone chased him, he would just walk faster. If people stopped chasing him, he would drag his feet as before, his eyes fixed, and not care about anything around him. Once, my old nanny was coming back from the market early in the morning with a basket, when one of these bums suddenly snatched a live fish from her. He ran a few steps and started gnawing on the raw fish like a hungry dog. The nanny chased after him, but he put the fish in his arms and pretended to be innocent. The nanny said to him: "I know you are hungry, but eating raw fish will make you sick, and it will be difficult to explain to the owner. Give it back to me, and I will give you money." When the bum saw the money, he took the live fish out of his arms, seemingly with a little sense of humor.

Let's talk about another morning with biting cold winds and interwoven rain and snow. I was walking along Fuzhou Road in the city and saw four or five beggar children sitting on the cement floor under an archway, hugging each other to keep warm. The scene was quite affectionate, and the meaning was quite different from the young women in dance halls hugging each other to dance. I firmly believe that the world would definitely be at peace if people and countries could be as affectionate as these beggar children. Not far past, next to an iron gate, I saw another pile of beggar children, about a dozen, all under the age of eight or nine. Maybe their minds were already adults, or maybe their actual age was over ten, but because of insufficient material conditions, the bodies given to them by heaven had their physiological development delayed by a few years compared to ordinary people. They were lined up in two neat rows, the back of the person in front pressed tightly against the chest of the person behind. They sat upright on the ground in the wind and snow, still fast asleep. It was truly the so-called "poor people have their own ways." They slept like this, the person behind becoming the pillow and mattress of the person in front, and the person in front becoming the quilt and blanket of the person behind. This truly became "relying on each other for life," and each life was combined into one life in the wind and snow. This pile of beggar children had nothing in the world except the warmth between them. In ancient times, there was something called a "meat screen," which this was probably similar to. Seeing this pile of beggar children, I finally realized the true meaning of the ancient saying "stranded carp moisten each other with breath and saliva." But today, some people are still "standing on the swamp, looking after the swans and deer," which is probably the so-called "forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes."

This truly corresponds to a passage in Hugo's "Les Misérables": "You (the rich) must check the weather records in the newspapers to know if the weather is cold. We don't have to look at thermometers. We ourselves are thermometers! We can feel the blood in our blood vessels congealing, and feel the ice as if it has touched our hearts."

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Six: Such a Fine Evening (27)

Bin Qi suddenly received the news that Qi Ren was about to leave Beiping. Not only had his mission been completed, but after receiving the letter, he rushed back that night. After getting off the train, he went straight to Xiaochang Hutong without even going home. He rang the doorbell, and Little Wang Ma opened the door. When she saw that it was Zhu Zhai, she was overjoyed and shouted: "Oh! Mr. Xu has really come back! The boss said: 'The train will arrive at this time, it must be him coming back,' but I didn't believe it..." As she spoke, she turned around to report. Zhu Zhai quickly stopped her and said: "Don't be so excited, let me sneak in and give her a surprise, a smile!" Little Wang Ma covered her mouth with one hand and giggled, saying: "Okay, okay!" The two of them tiptoed in. Just as they reached the courtyard, they heard Qi Ren asking from inside the room: "Is that Mr. Xu?" Little Wang Ma replied: "No, it's the mailman." Then they heard a sigh from inside the room saying: "If he doesn't come at this time, he won't be able to come back today!" She sighed twice more—Zhu Zhai couldn't help but rush up the stairs. Little Wang Ma rushed one step ahead and lifted the door curtain, smiling and shouting: "Boss, look, who is this?" She giggled as she spoke. At this time, Zhu Zhai had just stepped over the threshold, and Qi Ren, lying on the bed, had already seen him at a glance. She threw off the blanket covering her body, revealing her bright red pajamas, got out of bed in a flash, slipped on her slippers, rushed to Zhu Zhai, and held his hand tightly, saying: "Zhu, you're back!" Zhu Zhai smiled slightly, seeing her dressed in bright red pajamas, bright red slippers, with her beautiful hair scattered, which further highlighted the beauty of her bright eyes. He immediately put his hands on her shoulders, his eyes fixed on her face, constantly looking at her. Seeing him looking at her like this, Qi Ren turned her face away and said with a smile: "Don't you recognize me?" Zhu Zhai carefully looked at her face. After a while, he put both hands on her shoulders and shook them, saying: "Excellent! Excellent! I was most worried about the scar on your face. Now there is not a trace of it, it's truly gratifying!" Qi Ren pouted her small mouth very shyly and said: "It's not gone, I still have a small bump on my arm, it's very annoying!" As she spoke, she lifted the sleeve of her pajamas, revealing her snow-white arm, pointing to a small red dot on her arm and said, all my wounds have healed, only this one festered. It didn't get better after many days of treatment. Later, Dr. Wei examined it and found a piece of broken glass inside. It only closed after removing it, and now there is a small red bump left, how annoying!" Zhu Zhai stroked the small bump with his hand and said: "I don't think it's annoying at all. A small red bump on your snow-white arm makes it look more beautiful." Qi Ren twisted her delicate body and said: "You're just joking with me!" Zhu Zhai said: "Really, this arm of yours, as white as snow, with a small red bean dot, is called "Snow Wrapped in Red"." Qi Ren shook off Zhu Zhai's hand and pretended to be angry, saying: "Then, I've become dried vegetables!" Zhu Zhai laughed heartily. Just then, Little Wang Ma had already brought a hot towel and handed it to Zhu Zhai with a fragrant finger. Zhu Zhai wiped his face and rinsed his mouth with tea. Only then did Qi Ren pull him to sit side by side on a sofa. Zhu Zhai asked: "Why do you want to leave Beiping?" Qi Ren said: "I wrote so many letters, hoping you would come back, but you never came back!"

### Rejected

— Chou Sheng

Of course, the person who submits a manuscript is unhappy when he receives a rejection from the editor. But the editor is often equally uncomfortable when sending this rejection letter—who wants to hurt someone's feelings for no reason? And it is very difficult to write a rejection letter that is very tactful.

But according to an American writer, Vincent Starrett, Chinese editors are the best at the art of rejection!

Starrett's new book "Books and Two-Legged Animals" says: The Chinese are good at saving face, and editors are especially good at it. Then he gave an example of a rejection letter. The letter said: "We have read your manuscript in a group and are overjoyed beyond measure. We swear to the spirits of our ancestors that we have never read such a brilliant work. If we publish your manuscript, we will certainly not be able to publish any books in the future that are of a lower standard than this book. And your work is so sublime that, obviously, it is impossible to produce works of the same standard in the next ten thousand years. Therefore, we are very sorry that we have to return this supreme and sacred masterpiece to you. We offer you a thousand apologies and ask for your forgiveness!"

### The Sichuanese Dog Barks at Yao

— By Bai Wuwen, Drawing by Long Sheng

I remember Mr. Lin Yutang once drew an illustration, "Beating a Dog in the Water," for an article in the "Yu Si" of the Beijing Times. The main idea of the article was: even though a dog has fallen into the water, it must still be beaten mercilessly. The reason is that dogs know how to swim; if you don't beat it, once it gets ashore, it will shake water all over you and continue to attack you, barking and even biting.

There are quite a few dogs in Chongqing, especially stray dogs. When we night workers pass through each dark alley, many ferocious ones with big tails follow and bark madly, as if they are heroes performing their duty of guarding the night. But in reality, they are just stray dogs, guarding the alley but not the door. For example, in the alley where I live, thieves pry open doors several times a month, but the heroes remain silent as usual. On the other hand, the nearsighted Editor Wang, who returns home late from the opposite door, is often bitten, dripping with blood.

The proliferation of dogs in Chongqing is due less to the lack of strict management as in other cities, resulting in a state of anarchy, and more to the tolerance of the people towards dogs. In Hong Kong during the occupation, the old Irish Setters, German Shepherds, and Pekingese of the British and Americans were mostly eaten by the Chinese. The owners had already been imprisoned in concentration camps. There are not few starving people in Chongqing today, but they would rather snatch sesame cakes from the stalls than think about killing dogs. This is related to customs. A friend of mine, during the severe famine in Sichuan in 1936, went up the river from Chongqing to inspect various counties along the Jialing River and administer emergency relief. He saw disaster victims eating Guanyin earth and green oak leaves, while the stray dogs were all very fat and strong, because they had better food sources. The corpses of the starved were chewed up by them, increasing their nutrition and making them fat and well-fed. He asked them—the disaster victims—why they didn't eat dog meat. They replied: eating dog meat will lead to hell and prevent reincarnation. I then felt the greatness of the power of superstition. When people don't choose their food, using tree bark and grass roots to eke out a living, they will give up available food, even delicacies, for fear of hell, and would rather entrust their lives to unimaginable white mud and clay, so the dogs can eat them and grow strong.

Every day I see those people who come to beg for food, and I preach to them, advising them to kill dogs. What is strange is that the story of Mulian saving his mother—slaughtering dogs to break the fast—has taken root in the minds of farmers, while the story of Lu Zhishen, who got drunk and beat the mountain gate and ate dog meat, is far less popular than the former. Even if we talk about karma, isn't the flower monk who eliminated the evil tyrants in order to save people truly a compassionate Bodhisattva worthy of worship?

### Reservation Fee

— By Fang Ren

During the autumn semester's start, I struggled to raise a small sum for tuition, and it seems I still have many debts to clear. Unexpectedly, yesterday my child came home from school and took out a notice from his bag, urging us to pay the "reservation fee." The child, being ignorant, kept urging me to pay the money quickly, otherwise, his spot would be taken by someone else, and he wouldn't be able to study. When I heard this, I realized how much their teacher was scaring the ignorant children for this little bit of money. But for me, I could only comfort him gently, assuring him that Daddy would take care of it and not to worry.

In fact, Daddy's responsibilities have already reached an unbearable point. This semester's tuition for elementary school is 500,000 yuan, and next semester it will be no less than one million or more. Moreover, the younger children will also have to enroll, which would require two to three million yuan. Not to mention that I have no idea where to get this money, even the "reservation fee" that they are urging me to pay now, although only two hundred thousand yuan or so, will take a lot of effort to raise.

Speaking of the "reservation fee" system, it seems to be only practiced in a corner of Shanghai, and it is clearly unreasonable. The school authorities' excuse for collecting the "reservation fee" is supposedly to facilitate planning the number of new students to admit, but this argument is very far-fetched. Because, if you must have parents express their opinions on whether their children will continue their studies next semester, there are many ways other than money! Even if you must use money to obtain credit, there is no need to collect it so early, giving parents time to consider—whether to continue educating their children, transfer them to another school, or simply drop out!

Telegram Q&A: Answered by the Shanghai Telegraph Office

[Patron asks]: It is very inconvenient to send international telegrams from the western district. Can a branch office be set up near Nanjing West Road? (International Radio Station answers) According to the standards set by the Telecommunications Administration Bureau, a branch office can only be established if there are at least 600 outgoing telegrams per month. This station has calculated that the number of outgoing telegrams in the Nanjing West Road area each month is not enough to meet this standard, so there are no plans to set up a business office there at this time. Please understand. If you find it inconvenient to send telegrams because of the distance, please call (1120) between 10:00 AM and 8:00 PM to notify this station to send someone to collect them. No additional fees will be charged other than the telegram fee, but this is limited to those who pay in cash for the telegram.

[Liu Shibao of East Zhongzheng Road asks]: I am always satisfied with the thoughtful service of the picture bureau, but I have two things to ask for clarification. Is it difficult to get the outgoing telegram paper? Is there a solution? My small business intends to register a telegraphic code to facilitate telegrams from out-of-town customers, but so far I have been unable to register it. Why? (Answer) There are many people who ask for outgoing telegram paper every day, and sometimes there are slight restrictions to avoid waste. If your business has many outgoing telegrams, you can send a letter to the business department of this bureau to request a full book of outgoing telegram paper. This bureau has added 30,000 Chinese telegraphic codes since this month and should not be short of codes in the future. You are free to register.
