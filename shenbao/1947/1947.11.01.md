[United Press, New York, 31st Dispatch] U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton emphasized that U.S.-China relations are of vital importance. Mr. Eaton has always advocated a tough stance against the Soviet Union, and he is also at the forefront of Vishinsky's list of "war mongers." He said: "The Chinese are a great nation with 5,000 years of glorious culture. In the midst of hundreds of years of internal and external troubles, they have still maintained their national essence. The United States will eventually find that its economic destiny is largely in the city. If China falls into the hands of the Soviet Union, the impact on our future will be so great and profound that it is impossible to predict. If China can maintain its independence and defeat communism, then its future from a global economic perspective will become increasingly closely linked to that of the United States."

Eaton said that the difference between the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding China is due to the Soviet Union's goal of absorbing the 400 million Chinese people and their vast resources so as to bring them under Soviet control. Our policy is to assist the great Chinese people in developing their independent national future.

The matter was reported to the State Council meeting on the morning of the 31st.

### Workers of Special Trade Unions Allowed to Participate in Elections

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] In order to support workers' participation in politics, the government has recently submitted a report to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Social Affairs regarding workers who should organize special trade unions before the promulgation of the Trade Union Law for public enterprises, requesting permission to participate in the election of Legislative Committee members and National Assembly representatives in this session. This case was submitted for discussion and passed at the State Council meeting on the 31st. It is investigated that Article 6 of the Enforcement Regulations for the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives stipulates that the occupational groups and women's groups participating in the election are limited to those who have been registered with their competent authorities in accordance with the law. However, since the Trade Union Law has not yet been promulgated, the trade union organizations of various special trade unions such as telecommunications, mining, and railways have not been fully established, and various special trade unions have been assigned the number of Legislative Committee members and National Assembly representatives, so it should be remedied, and the preparatory personnel of each organization or the business institutions should refer to the supplementary notes on the election methods of special trade unions to create a register of participants in the election and send it to the local election office for election.

### Battle for Yongji Intensifies, Bandits Launch Fierce Attacks on Suburbs but Fail, Entire Shenyang-Changchun Railway Line Cleared of Bandits

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 31st Dispatch] The battle for Yongji is becoming increasingly fierce. Communist bandits are constantly reinforcing and shelling, and are making desperate charges. The National Army is cooperating by land and air to strike hard at the bandit hordes. In the past two days, the fighting at Huanxi Ridge in the western suburbs of Yongji has been the most brutal.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 31st Dispatch] The number of bandits attacking Yongji has reached 110,000, and their unit numbers are extremely chaotic. The bandits have transferred new reinforcements from northern Jilin to attack Yongji fiercely, especially in the Longhe Li Mountain and Yushanzi areas, where the fighting is even more fierce. However, those familiar with the Yongji situation generally believe that Yongji is surrounded by mountains and backed by water, forming a natural danger. In addition, the fortifications are strong, and the morale of the National Army is extremely high, so it is not easy for the bandits to succeed.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 1st Dispatch] The battle for Yongji is intensifying. The main force of the bandit's First Column has infiltrated into the southwestern area of Yongji. The reinforcing bandit army launched repeated fierce attacks on the airfield (northeast of the city) and Sandao Lingzi (6 kilometers southwest of Yongji) with concentrated artillery fire on the night of the 30th, and fierce battles broke out with the defending army. In one night, the bandit army shelled the airfield more than a thousand times. Our defending army was loyal and courageous, and fought back fiercely against the stubborn bandit army. The bandits launched repeated attacks, but all failed. In addition, a bandit force of more than a thousand people, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on Huanxi Ridge, two kilometers west of Yongji, and fierce fighting is still underway.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 31st Dispatch] The Changchun battle situation is gradually entering a new stage. Previously, the bandits launched a sneak attack on Kuanchengzi Dafangshen Airport in the northwest suburbs, but ultimately failed. The National Army, which had been lingering in the suburbs for a long time, has re-blocked the checkpoints in the suburbs from this afternoon. The Communist bandits who launched a sneak attack on Changchun City the night before have been lingering in the northwest area of Changchun City in recent days. After the National Army launched an attack yesterday, there were many spoils.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 31st Dispatch] The National Army in Siping divided its troops and went north, and one route was unstoppable. The vanguard troops have arrived at Guojiadian and are continuing to advance. In addition, the defending army in Beipiao launched an attack on the 29th and has met with the National Army advancing westward from Changtu County. They are now launching a mop-up operation against the remaining bandits in the surrounding area.

[United Press, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] A telegram from Shenyang today said: The National Army has joined forces at Gongzhuling, and the entire Panjin-Changchun Railway line has been cleared of all Communist bandits.

### National Army Arduously Defends Yulin, Shortening the Defense Line and Abandoning Outposts Outside the City, Reinforcements Are on the Way and Will Arrive Soon

[Our Newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 30th Dispatch] The defense battle of Yulin in northern Shaanxi is becoming increasingly fierce. Communist bandits have gathered more than 30,000 people and have been building fortifications around the city for days. After the withdrawal from Shenmu, in order to concentrate its forces and shorten the defense line, the National Army has abandoned the outposts around Yulin and is firmly defending the city walls. In addition, two brigades of Communist bandits are scurrying through Yubei towards the Zhasak Banner of the Yimeng, seemingly to cut off the Bao-Yu traffic and plunder materials. The National Army reinforcements are on the way and will arrive soon.

[Our Newspaper, Baotou, 31st Dispatch] On the night of the 30th, the southeast corner of Yulin City was fiercely bombarded by the Communist bandits' artillery, and the positions around the Lingxiao Pagoda were destroyed. The defending army in the city is counterattacking on the 31st.

[Our Newspaper, Guihua, 31st Dispatch] Chairman Qiwu of Suiyuan Province told reporters: The gain or loss of Yulin is related to the safety of Suiyuan. Director Fu and the military and civilians of Chahar and Suiyuan are determined to make their best efforts to relieve Yulin.

(According to investigations, Zhang Zongxun, also known as Zongxun, who commanded the bandits attacking Yulin, is a Korean rogue. He met Zhang Zongchang in a gambling game when he was wandering in Harbin in his early years. They hit it off and became brothers. When Zhang Zongchang served as the military governor, he considered himself the military governor's brother and changed his name to Zhang Zongxun. He is good at Russian, and Zhang Zongchang's so-called "Maozi soldiers" were under his command. Later, when Zhang's power failed, he lived in Dalian. After the July 7th Incident, when Zhang Huanan first served as the puppet mayor of Yantai, he served as the guard captain, and later as the commander of the puppet Shandong Provincial Garrison Corps. He was cruel by nature. He once led the garrison corps (Yantai people called them "second devils") to the countryside, set fire to villages, and used machine guns to strafe the entrances of various villages. The villagers therefore called him "Zhang the Skinner." After the victory, he fled to the Communist bandits again. Now, he is leading bandits to attack Yulin in northern Shaanxi, which is also proof that the Korean Communists are participating in the internal unrest.)

[Reuters, Nanjing, 31st Dispatch] Yulin was captured by the bandits on the 31st.

### Wu Tiecheng on Universal Suffrage: Democratic Politics Requires Practical Learning; Hopes for Optimistic Cooperation from All Sectors

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Wu Tiecheng, in his remarks to reporters today regarding his views on universal suffrage, stated that universal suffrage and party nominations are both first-time experiences for the people of our nation. Even if completely reasonable and legitimate outcomes cannot be achieved, the experience is still valuable.

Party nominations are a common practice in democratic countries, and campaigning is a normal right of the people in democratic nations. As for how to truly "select the virtuous and capable, uphold good faith, and cultivate harmony," all of this can be thoroughly tested in the election campaigns. Our countrymen often say that democratic politics must be learned in practice, just as swimming requires learning in the water; this is the same idea. If one dwells on signs of disputes and doubts the future of constitutional governance, is this not akin to ridiculing a child's clumsy steps? The nominations of our party are from the bottom up. Even if there are unfair aspects in the candidates proposed at the county and provincial levels, the central government still has the final power of review. However, with a limited number of positions, it is truly unavoidable that some talented individuals will be overlooked. If one considers this as unfair, it is not an equitable assessment. I deeply hope that people from all walks of life will view this first universal suffrage with optimism, cooperate with it, and jointly lay the initial foundation for constitutional governance.

### Chairman Chiang's Letter to President of Doane College: Supporting Fundraising for Church Universities

[Central News Agency, New York, Day Omitted] The Union Board of Trustees for Chinese Church Universities published Chairman Chiang's letter to its chairman, President Arthur B. Doane, in its monthly bulletin last month regarding the fundraising of $600,000 to assist our various church universities' expenses for this academic year. The original text of the letter is as follows: "Not only have the church universities cultivated a number of outstanding talents in the mechanical sciences, but also they have occupied a leading position in cultivating individuals of outstanding character and thought.

This trial was one-sided and unfair, and Chinese law is bad, and did not investigate the background of the case. My property has been confiscated, and I have no winter clothes and no money to buy coal for heating. Rather than suffer like this for a long time, it is better to die quickly."

### Editorial: Establishing a New Chinese Legal System

The fourth annual meeting of the Chinese Society of Law will be held in this city today, and the President of the Judicial Yuan, Ju Zheng, will personally preside over it. The convening of this annual meeting, gathering outstanding legal professionals from all over the country, is of great significance at this time of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. On the occasion of the opening of the meeting, in addition to congratulating the success of the meeting, we would like to briefly discuss the establishment of a new Chinese legal system:

First, the entire country is currently mobilized to suppress rebellion. When we examine the origin of the rebellion, the reasons are certainly not simple, but the lack of a spirit of abiding by the law among the Chinese people, which has damaged the dignity of the rule of law, is also one of the main reasons. All people in the country should absolutely abide by the laws of the country, without exception. In a country ruled by law, everyone should be under the law, and there should be no so-called "supra-legal" behavior. We have been compiling modern laws since the late Qing Dynasty, and the time has not been too short. How to implement the rule of law in the future is of great importance to the cause of national construction. We hope that the convening of this annual meeting can lead to practical and feasible decisions on how to establish a good foundation for vigorously implementing the rule of law.

Second, China has had its own contributions to jurisprudence since ancient times, forming a unique legal system. During the Tang Dynasty, the laws and regulations were strict and clear, and were praised by the world. In the last hundred years, due to frequent contact with foreign countries, our country began to accept some of the spirit of foreign laws and re-drafted our laws. Since the establishment of the Legislative Yuan, it has again revised our civil and criminal laws in accordance with the teachings of the founding father. The legislative spirit and the progress of legislative techniques have been praised by legal scholars around the world. However, many of our country's basic laws, especially in the area of social legislation, still need to be revised. We hope that these laws can be completed as soon as possible so that a legal system based on the Three Principles of the People can be established in time.

Third, speaking of the judiciary, in recent years, under the situation of high prices and turbulent life, judicial personnel throughout the country have been loyal to their duties and have won general praise. In terms of our judicial system, President Ju has also been constantly making improvements in order to adapt to the needs of the times. After the implementation of the Constitution in the future, the dignity of the judiciary will be further enhanced. The establishment of a legal system requires not only perfect legislation, but also enlightened justice. We admire how the precedents of the US Supreme Court have influenced the growth and education of American jurisprudence and believe in the importance of the position of judicial officers. In the establishment of a new Chinese legal system, we also hope that Chinese judicial organs can make the same contributions as those in Britain and America.

### The First Merchant's Day

Merchant's Day is a brand new holiday. On this day last year, when the National Federation of Commerce and Industry held a meeting in the capital, the participating representatives believed that the National Federation of Commerce and Industry's meeting in the capital after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was of great significance, and resolved to designate the day the meeting was convened as Merchant's Day. The establishment of this holiday came from the initiative of the merchants. Although it has not yet been officially approved by the National Government, since the merchants have made this request for their own benefit, it seems that it can echo with the May Day Labor Day. Now, on the occasion of the first Merchant's Day, I would like to express my views as an encouragement.

Scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants have been called the four classes of people since ancient times, but merchants have been particularly despised, said to be pursuers of trivial matters, and distributers rather than creators of wealth. Since the opening of maritime trade, thinking seems to have changed, but the exploitation by intermediaries, which increases the burden on consumers, remains a very deep and widespread impression; as if it were best for everything between producers and consumers to be direct, without the need for a third party to act as an intermediary.

Yes, the transfer of everything by these third parties does increase costs, thereby increasing the burden on users. Within the realm of what is possible, minimizing these transfers as much as possible, or using various cooperative organizations to reduce costs and prevent the outflow of benefits, is very reasonable and a very suitable disposition to the trend.

But then again, the existence of all commerce does not necessarily depend entirely on the one-sided requests of merchants, but rather on the needs of the majority of patrons. If this need does not exist, or if there is a slight need but the number is small, then no matter how much publicity, solicitation, decoration, and arrangement is done, the door will eventually be deserted, and it will be forced to close. On the contrary, even under strict laws and severe punishments, despite the high pressure from the government, they rise and fall, and sometimes they are still difficult to eliminate. This is because their supply of materials or services has its own indelible value. Moreover, in a modern society, the division of labor is increasingly detailed. Mencius in the Warring States period already said: "If everything that hundreds of artisans make must be prepared by one person, and only then can they be used, it is to lead the entire world on the road." In this era of commodity production, it is of course superfluous to artificially create separations between farmers, artisans, and merchants.

However, since the existence of commerce depends on the needs of society, how to meet this need, that is, how to reduce its price and improve its quality, and supply it in a timely manner, is an objective view to cater to the preferences of the general public, thereby strengthening its position, is a fundamental issue that merchants themselves urgently need to study. There are many outdated industries that cannot adapt to the times and keep up with the pace, resulting in being overshadowed and suffering natural elimination; this is entirely due to poor human planning and cannot be blamed on others.

Secondly, economic life is originally a part of the social form, and is closely related to other political, cultural and other parts, and can never be separated into two. After the Great War, the so-called free trade doctrine has already had only a remnant of breath and is no longer valued by the world; the economic policies of various countries, to some extent, have a flavor of government intervention or control, even Britain and the United States, which are known for advocating freedom, cannot avoid intervening in private economic life to some extent, let alone others? Since our country promulgated the Emergency Economic Measures Program last year, it has gradually embarked on this path of control again. Since the promulgation of the General Mobilization for Suppression of Rebellion this year, the need for control has become stronger. In this extraordinary period, all sectors of industry and commerce should face the facts of the present day. Comply with laws and regulations, and cooperate properly to comply with national policies. There are many contradictory, repetitive, biased and unreasonable places in the current laws and temporary measures, but before they are legally amended, whether it is to stand by and watch, refuse to cooperate, or comply superficially but defy secretly, intending to be opportunistic, or even willingly not care and violate laws and prohibitions, these are not attitudes that normal merchants should have. In the government, it is based on the general principle of the People's Livelihood, that when establishing various control programs, try to take into account the basic freedoms and rights that the people should enjoy, and be careful to visit and consult, and not act arbitrarily. But on the part of the merchants, when the steps are thorny and the difficulties are heavy, the merchants, while trying to solve the pain they are experiencing, must also consider the difficulties of the country. We deeply sympathize with the merchants' pain, and earnestly hope that the government will improve control, be generous, sympathize with the merchants' difficulties, and cultivate the strength of the people. At the same time, we must also hope that the general merchants will improve the sharpness of service, recognize the current situation, and be careful in their self-care, in order to reduce unnecessary disputes.

### Zhou Yide Talks About Impressions of North China: The Common People Still Work Diligently; Despite Heavy Difficulties, Recovery Is Still Promising

[Our Newspaper] Zhou Yide began his press conference at 5:30 PM yesterday, speaking in Beiping dialect. He said: "I have lived in China for ten years, the first year in Nanjing, the next five years in Fujian, and the next four years in the West. So my Chinese has a Minbei accent. This time I came to China to conduct an inspection, originally scheduled to have five members of Congress, belonging to the Far East and Foreign Affairs Committees, but due to the special meeting of the US Congress on November 10 to discuss the aid to Europe issue, the other four were tied up with affairs in the United States."

One reporter asked him about his impressions of North China, and his answer was very unique: "The currency inflation, traffic destruction, and political incompetence in North China, if it were in the United States, it would really be a terrible thing, but the situation in China is another matter. The common people are still working vigorously and enduring pain. Everything is better than we thought in the United States. Therefore, I think that although China is currently facing heavy difficulties, it is not without hope, as long as there is a correct method, recovery is still promising."

This friend, who has consistently sympathized with China, was unwilling to reveal the contents of his future report to Congress, but he frankly explained that there are two points that he is particularly concerned with: "First, the general political and economic situation in China, because 70 percent of China's budget is used for military affairs, and the resources and strength of the entire country are also consumed in the war. We have to pay attention to the military situation. The second is propaganda work, today, propaganda has become a powerful weapon. Mussolini once said: 'The first time you lie, people don't believe it, but if you repeat it hundreds or thousands of times without change, people will go from doubt to belief.' Later Hitler, and now the Soviet Union, are faithful executors of this principle. Therefore, today the world is full of lies with propaganda effect."

### Both Policies are Attacked: America in a Dilemma

Let's give some examples, such as America attempting to revive Japan; America hoping to control China; America wanting to launch a war against the Soviet Union; America wanting to support Germany to contain the Soviet Union. These are all lies that only consider the ends and disregard the means. Regarding Europe, if America stands idly by, we are accused of isolationism; if we actively assist, we are labeled as imperialists. It's truly laughable. In such circumstances, we must pay attention to propaganda. The best way to combat lies is to promote the truth. All those who believe in democracy and freedom should strive to promote these concepts."

He said that Japan has no hope of revival in fifty years. America's assistance to Japan is only to enable the Japanese to feed themselves, not to make them strong. Japan's future lies in China's hands. Without China's raw materials and market, Japan cannot sustain itself at all. The conversation naturally turned to American loans. The congressman said he could not answer this question, but he could say that the American people sympathize with China and are willing to do their best to help. The question is, what method should be adopted? He said, "As for myself, for the past two years, I have been advocating for aid to China, but unfortunately, out of the four hundred and fifty-three members of Congress, I am the only one who has been shouting loudly, and it has had no effect. Now, the overall situation in the East and West is changing. America has changed its policies in Greece, Turkey, Western Europe, and the UN General Assembly, and will be forced to do so in China in the future."

### Banning the Democratic League is Internal Affairs: Zhou Yide Says it is Inconvenient to Criticize

The issue of the Democratic League was also raised. The congressman's answer was: "Some individuals in the Democratic League have engaged in pro-communist activities, but this is China's internal affair, and it is not convenient for me to criticize it." Zhou Yide's attitude is quite frank and clear. He said: "In China, you need to use your ears more." We hope that after he returns home, he can use his mouth more to eliminate all misunderstandings between China and the United States, and realize his wish that "China and the United States should continue to cooperate after the war as they did during the war."

### The Marshall Plan Encounters Considerable Resistance: The British Government Feels Deeply Uneasy; Cripps Says He No Longer Has Extravagant Hopes; Taft Once Again Criticizes Truman's Various Policies

[United Press London, 30th] British Economic Minister Cripps stated at a press conference: Britain is prepared to be self-reliant if necessary, even if it cannot obtain American assistance. However, this will inevitably lead to a further reduction in food rations and a further lowering of the already declining living standards. He stated that the Labor government no longer has extravagant hopes for the Marshall Plan and other forms of American aid. The government is only considering aid from the Commonwealth. Cripps also stated: "We face the facts. We are doing our best to overcome our economic difficulties and are prepared to fight alone for several years if necessary. If the Marshall Plan cannot be implemented, we must seriously consider its impact on world development, especially on the development of Europe.

[Reuters Washington, 30th] The Paris Sixteen-Nation Conference has completed its report on the discussion of the Marshall Plan. Although it has been four weeks since then, there is still no indication of what the final form of this aid plan will be. Therefore, officials in the United States and Europe are becoming increasingly impatient. What those who support the aid-to-Europe plan are most concerned about at present is that more and more people in the American political and business circles are opposing the Marshall Plan in view of the socialist trend in Europe. Senator Taft publicly stated that the proposed scale of assistance is unreasonable. It is clear that there is a growing trend in agreement with Taft's claim. Today's "Wall Street Journal" also stated that aiding Europe is one thing, but assisting several European governments that embrace bankrupt philosophies and are on the verge of collapse is another, which clearly implies opposition to aid to Europe.

[United Press Washington, 31st] Republican presidential candidate Taft declared that there is little hope for cooperation between Democrats and Republicans on the issue of dealing with price recovery and inflation at the upcoming special session of Congress. The Truman administration's various policies are not sound, and I cannot cooperate with them. Secretary of State Marshall and Undersecretary of State Lovett met with President Truman today, probably to make a final decision on the aid-to-Europe bill.

### American Attention Turns to the East: Eaton Emphasizes the Issue of American Aid to China

[United Press New York, 30th] After weeks of focusing on Europe, American attention has now shifted eastward, and the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East has once again attracted attention. Just as the United States suffered a small defeat against the Soviet Union on the Korean issue in the United Nations, Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, met with United Press reporters in Washington on the 31st and issued a warning that the United States should not neglect Asia while assisting Western Europe. Eaton said that the United States "for the safety of itself and mankind" should immediately assume the responsibility of leading the world in all matters, and that both parties should implement a long-term cooperation policy to enable the United States to gain leadership. Eaton also said that he himself and the House Foreign Affairs Committee intend to seriously consider and extensively study the reports of Zhou Yide and other congressmen in China. Eaton concluded, "Our most urgent task is to gather our intelligence and establish principles in order to resolve our relations with China and the rest of the world. Only then can we decide how to implement these principles."

### The United Nations Small General Assembly Will Become an Investigative Body

[United Press Success Lake, 30th] The fifteen-nation drafting group established by the UN General Assembly Political Committee to study the organizational law of the "Small General Assembly" decided today to grant the Assembly the power to investigate throughout the world, but subject to the following two restrictions: Investigative matters must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the representatives present at the Small General Assembly before they can proceed. Investigations outside the headquarters of the United Nations organization must first obtain the permission of the country being investigated. The group also decided that the Small General Assembly may discuss and study methods for maintaining peace and security during the recess of the General Assembly.

### The Soviet Union Demands that the Allied Control Council for Germany Sever Relations with the Brazilian Mission: General Clay Refuses

[United Press Berlin, 30th] General Clay, the American Commander-in-Chief in Germany, rejected the Soviet request on the 30th to sever relations between the Allied Control Council for Germany and the Brazilian military mission here, claiming that the Brazilian government's severing of relations with the Soviet Union was a "reactionary and anti-democratic" act. General Clay refused to detail Marshal Sokolovsky, the Soviet Commander-in-Chief's request, and defended the Brazilian people and government. Clay stated: He could not accept Mr. Sokolovsky's statement. As everyone knows, the Brazilian army fought side by side with the British and American armies in Italy, and this can be regarded as Brazil being an ally resisting the Axis powers. General Clay then requested that the entire issue be postponed for discussion at the next meeting on November 10.

### Korean Issue: Debate in the UN General Assembly Political Committee Results in Passage of the US Amendment: The Chinese Representative Supports the US Position

[United Press Success Lake, 30th] After two days of debate, the 57-nation Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed the US proposal today by a vote of 41 to 0, inviting Korean representatives to participate in the debate on the issue of Korean unification, and the candidates will be elected under the supervision of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea.

This is regarded as an amendment to the original Soviet proposal. When put to a vote, it was rejected by 35 votes to 6, with 7 abstentions, excluding the Soviet Union and the six countries of the Slavic bloc. Soviet Representative Gromyko insisted on voting on the original proposal, which was rejected by 35 votes to 6, with 10 abstentions. Previously, the Soviet Union suggested that the US amendment be treated as a separate proposal and put to a vote, which was rejected by 43 votes to 6, with 4 abstentions. Ukraine's suggestion to shelve the US amendment was also rejected by 40 votes to 6, with 5 abstentions.

US Representative Dulles warned that the situation in Korea is extremely explosive, so the United Nations should consider supporting the plan for Korean independence as soon as possible. After the defeat, Gromyko immediately proposed to stop the discussion of the Korean issue. This suggestion was ultimately rejected. Chinese Representative Wei Jun spoke in support of the US amendment.

### Indian Representative Advocates Expanding the Authority of the UN Commission on Korea

[United Press Success Lake, 30th] The Indian delegation to the United Nations General Assembly decided on the 30th to formally submit a proposal to the Political Committee, advocating that the "observational" authority of the United Nations Commission on Korea be expanded to "supervisory." The Indian delegation made this decision after meeting with representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada and obtaining assurances from the three countries that they would support its proposal in principle.

### US Government Sues Seventeen Banks: Accused of Monopolizing the Securities Market

[United Press Washington, 30th] On the 30th, the US government sued Wall Street bankers for conspiring to monopolize the financing of American industry. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against seventeen leading investment banking firms and the Investment Bankers Association of America under the Anti-Trust Act. The accusation is that the firms conspired to restrict competition in the trading of securities stocks. They issue securities, which investors buy themselves, and then sell the securities. The US government claims that this method is unreasonable, and the price, conditions, and circumstances under which the public purchases stocks are restricted. Attorney General Clark said that this lawsuit is one of the most important actions he has taken since the establishment of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Morgan Company is also one of the defendants.

### Mendi Faces Difficulties Under Attack from Both Left and Right: The French Cabinet Gains a Vote of Confidence: The Government Adopts a Middle Road to Prevent National Division

[United Press Paris, 30th] The French National Assembly cast a vote of confidence in Ramadier's united cabinet, which adopted a middle road, on the night of the 31st, gaining only a narrow majority. In this way, the French cabinet can avoid collapsing under the combined attack of the Communist Party and the anti-communist French People's League led by de Gaulle, the wartime leader of Free France. The vote of confidence in the government passed by a majority of 300 to 280 (18 abstentions).

The National Assembly began voting at 6:45 pm on the 30th. The parties voted according to the instructions given by their leaders earlier. Ramadier, emotionally agitated, issued a shocking appeal before the vote, asking for clear trust and support for the government to avoid the division of France. He said: "We ask those who are loyal to France and the Republic to cast a vote of confidence in the government, and those who oppose France or are hesitant should cast a vote of no confidence in us, because the worst possible situation still exists, that is, whether France will be split into a pro-Soviet camp or a pro-American camp, or whether France will cooperate with all countries with its free will." Ramadier also responded to de Gaulle's request to hold a referendum, saying: "This is whether we will use the referendum to overthrow the parliament." When Speaker Herriot announced the opening of the meeting, two-thirds of the gallery was full. This was the seventh time that Ramadier had asked the parliament for confidence, and undoubtedly also the most dangerous. The Communist Party, the far-right parties, and the Republican Liberty Party voted against it, while the Popular Republican Movement voted for it.

[United Press Paris, 31st] Most members of the French National Assembly and those who sympathize with the government declared today that the Ramadier cabinet will be forced to reorganize again within a month, so that Socialist provincial veterans such as former Prime Minister Blum can join the cabinet.

### The Total Preliminary Allied Claims for Japanese Reparations Reach 54 Billion US Dollars: China's Claims Account for 40% of the Total

[United Press Washington, 30th] The total preliminary allied claims for Japanese reparations from the eleven Pacific allies are estimated at approximately 54 billion US dollars, according to one-sided estimates. A responsible person said that China's claims to the Far Eastern Commission here are the highest, accounting for 40% of the total. Based on the Philippines' official claim for 4.1 billion yuan in compensation and its request to obtain 15% of all reparations, China's claim is estimated to be approximately 12 billion yuan.

The Far Eastern Commission also announced that efforts to reduce the demands of various countries over the past eight days have failed to reach an agreement. The total amount of reparations from Germany and Japan must be determined by the final peace treaty. The Soviet Union's claims for reparations from Germany are approximately 10 billion yuan, and its claims for reparations from Japan are approximately 3.3 billion yuan. The total amount of Japanese reparations has not been announced, but based on percentages, it is approximately 14 billion yuan. The percentages of other countries' claims are as follows: Australia 28, Canada 1.5, France 12, India 12.5, Netherlands 12, New Zealand 2, United Kingdom 25, United States 28. The United States has abandoned any claims for factories that have already been allocated, but retains the right to speak on the allocation of major reparations in the future. The eleven countries that directly fought Japan initially proposed their respective proportions of compensation and the proportions they believed other countries should receive. As a result, the total proportion that each country should receive was 204.5%, while the proportion that other countries should receive was only 92%. Since the negotiations in February of this year, the initial proportion has been reduced to 189%. The final agreement on the total amount of reparations and the method of distribution should be included in the peace treaty with Japan. The United States proposed convening a preliminary meeting of the eleven countries to negotiate the peace treaty with Japan, but it was called off due to the Soviet Union's firm opposition. The Soviet Union advocated that the four major powers should preside over the meeting. Philippine Representative Romulo urged the countries with veto power to avoid using their privileges, and said that every day the issue of compensation is delayed, the existing Japanese equipment will be damaged.

### The Soviet Union Occupies Austrian Oil Fields: The United States Protests Again

[Central News Washington, 30th] The US State Department announced today that the United States has once again protested to the Soviet Union over the Soviet Union's occupation of the Anglo-American-owned Laba refinery in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria. This note from the US to the Soviet Union is a continuation of the British and American protest issued in August of this year. This note refutes the Soviet Union's claim that the refinery should be allocated for reparations, stating that the occupation of the refinery constitutes an infringement on the property rights of American citizens. The oil industry is one of the main compensation points in the draft Austrian peace treaty drawn up by the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

[This Newspaper] Ju Xuexiang urged the Assembly to pay attention to the "proposal to abolish the decoration outside the cigarette packaging," which he had previously proposed and which was co-signed by Zhao Junhao and 27 others.

As for Leng Shan's written record at the police bureau, the main points are as follows: "Leng Shan's real name is Jin Zhaoyuan, 30 years old, from Suzhou, and works in film. Because he was a director at Guotai, he got to know Xiao Dangui. It was just ordinary friendship. Although Xiao and I exchanged letters, they were all about reviewing the art of acting and nothing else. They were just ordinary letters, so they have been lost. A few days ago, Xiao Dangui called and asked me to watch a movie at the Dahua that afternoon at 8:00 PM. We met at Dahua. Since it was still early before the movie started, we hired a car to go to Zhaofeng Park. After getting out of the car, we walked a few steps and turned back. We walked and talked. We walked to Daxilu Jing'an Temple Road and parted ways. It was already past 10:00 PM. At 6:00 PM on the 8th, Zhang and others came to find me there. Zhang told Xiao Dangui not to speak and let me confess, saying that watching movies and strolling on the street were also ordinary things. Zhang was furious and said, 'You ordinary, I not ordinary,' and reached out and hit me in the face, knocking off my glasses. After being persuaded by others, Zhang said again, 'If you really haven't opened a room with Xiao, kneel down and swear an oath.' When I left, I said, 'If I have caused discord between you and your wife, I will never see Xiao again.' As for why Xiao Ling committed suicide, I don't know the reason. I haven't seen Xiao since the confrontation." Wang Qianyun, Xiao Dangui's sister, testified at the police bureau, "My sister is usually quiet. She has lived with Zhang for seven years, but she has no children. I go to her place to play every morning and evening, and we only talk about family matters and nothing else. My sister and Zhang divide their finances clearly. My sister is very frugal and often copies and reads scripts. Her relationship with Zhang is very good and they have lived together until now, and they have never quarreled. On the 8th, I heard people say that my sister watched a movie with a man and was questioned by Zhang. I wasn't there, so I don't know the details. On the afternoon of the 9th, I went to my sister's place and saw Zhang, Leng Shan, and Mr. Wu talking behind closed doors. I don't know what they were talking about. After that, I often saw my sister crying, but she still went to Guotai to play, as if nothing had happened. On the 13th, I came out of the Narcissus room on the upper floor of the Zhedong Building and walked past my sister's door. I saw my sister sitting cross-legged on the bed, writing on the bedding with her finger or pen. I didn't pay attention to what she was writing. Soon I heard Wei shouting in my sister's room, 'What's wrong, Chunfengmei (Xiao Dangui)!' I immediately entered my sister's room and saw Zhang hugging my sister and asking, 'What's wrong, Chunfeng? What's wrong, Chunfeng?' Then she was sent to the hospital, but she died. I don't know the rest of the situation. My sister doesn't owe any debts and her relationship with Zhang is good. However, a corner of the Guotai Theatre collapsed, the house in the countryside was burned down, and the house bought in Hangzhou was occupied by others. She was often depressed about it."

### Two Lives Ended Together: A Tragedy Occurs at the Tianjin Beiyang Hotel - Unmarried Couple Peacefully Commits Suicide

[Report from Tianjin, 28th by our correspondent] At noon on the 28th, a tragic case of suicide was discovered in room 359 of the Beiyang Hotel in Tianjin. A young, unmarried couple was found to have committed suicide by poison. They died in each other's arms, with the woman's head resting on the man's right arm.

The room where the tragedy occurred was located on the northeastern corner of the upper floor. The room had windows facing east and north. The north window was covered with a yellow floral curtain. Inside the room, there was a wardrobe, a washbasin, a dressing table, a square table, and a coffee table. A brass bed was placed against the wall, and the suicidal young couple lay on it. The man was lying on the inner side of the bed, wearing a white cloth short jacket and white cloth trousers. The woman was wearing a white shirt and white trousers, with a light blue jacket over her upper body, and her head resting on the man's right arm. There was no sign of struggle or pain on their faces. They seemed to have lost consciousness peacefully, bidding farewell to the human world. According to the bellboy of the Beiyang Hotel:

The young couple checked into the room at 2:00 PM on the 27th. The names registered on the guest book were Sai Qinglong and Dong Yanqing, both 23 years old, from Shenyang, and their occupation was listed as Xinyuan Bank. After checking in, the two went out together and returned late at night. After returning, they borrowed pen and ink from the bellboy to write a letter, then went out to mail the letter in the mailbox at the entrance of the hotel. Afterwards, they asked the bellboy for hot water and then closed the door and went to sleep. At noon on the 28th, the bellboy on duty patrolled the rooms and discovered that the young couple was lying motionless on the bed.

An autopsy revealed that Sai Qinglong's gums, lips, and the soles of his feet were all blue, and blue spots were found all over his body.

Dong's condition was exactly the same, with a small amount of white powder still in her mouth. A five-hundred-yuan bill was found on the coffee table in front of the bed, with some white powder residue on it. There was also one and a half copies of the "Wantongding" leaflet from the Tianjin Dasheng Pharmaceutical Company, with the words "anesthetic" written on the back. The examiner determined that the deceased had died from taking a large amount of anesthetic.

According to the identity cards of the deceased: the man's name was indeed Sai Qinglong, also known as Sai Yichang, from Tianjin. The woman's name was Dong Jifeng, 23 years old, from Yingkou, currently residing at No. 5 Jixing South Lane, Baoji Road, Tianjin. Sai Qinglong used to work for the Third Training Team of the United Logistics Headquarters but had since left and had no current occupation. He lived with his half-brother Sai Minglu at a friend's house. He and Dong Jifeng had fallen in love through friendship and had gotten engaged on June 2nd of this year. Dong Jifeng had previously studied at Tianjin Tianshen Middle School and had worked as an elementary school teacher. The two usually had a very harmonious relationship. Sai Mingxuan said: Sai Qinglong lost his job shortly after getting engaged, and they could not get married early. This may be the reason for their suicide. Dong Jifeng had elderly parents, two younger sisters, and a younger brother. According to her sister, Dong Jifeng usually said: "Sai Yili is my burden." On the morning of the 27th, she told her mother that she was going to her second sister-in-law's place in Hedong and asked her for two thousand yuan for transportation. She also asked her sister for ten thousand yuan, saying that she was going to Nankai. Unexpectedly, she did not return that night, and the next day, this tragedy occurred. The police found a torn red letter in Dong Jifeng's pocket, which read: "To my beloved parents: This time, I never thought..." It can be inferred that the letter mailed by the deceased before the suicide may have been sent to Dong Jifeng's home. The reason for this suicide may be explained in the letter itself, waiting for the recipient to receive it and make everything clear. (Reporter: Li Shaolin)

### Another Corpse in a Trunk Case Appears in Tianjin After the Suicide of the Unmarried Couple

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 31st] A shocking case of a corpse in a trunk has recently been discovered in Tianjin.

### Public Inspection of the Masses

The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai, is carrying out a general inspection of the membership certificates of its members. Those whose certificates have been canceled and have not yet reapplied should quickly go through the reapplication procedures. Those who have already submitted their certificates for inspection but have not yet received them should quickly retrieve them and pay the fees.

### Construction of the Chamber of Commerce Building

The grand plan to construct a monumental building for the Chamber of Commerce, costing hundreds of millions of yuan and taking considerable time, is a matter of great international significance and a source of honor for our Chamber of Commerce. The initial planning and continued efforts have built upon the foundation laid by previous administrations. Fundraising efforts have been extensive, and progress has been commendable. A final decision has been made to complete the fundraising process, reflecting the unwavering commitment of all members. However, a sudden cessation of operations, accompanied by loud noises and disruptions, would render the efforts of the entire chamber meaningless. The current Chairman and all committee members have made special visits and carefully considered how to continue fundraising. Although the current market prices are difficult, our commitment to raising hundreds of millions of yuan remains unchanged. The immediate challenge is to address the financial shortfall. The construction project is intimately linked to the reputation and future development of our Chamber of Commerce. The splendid building will showcase the spirit of international cooperation. The continuation of this undertaking, the establishment of palaces, pavilions, association halls, the formation of new guest houses, and the celebration of great occasions are all interconnected. The planning and construction should align with the collective will of the members, ensuring that the construction of the Chamber of Commerce building achieves a success that is both celebrated and admired. The legacy should be passed down through generations. The resolution to unite and forge ahead was affirmed by the general committee meeting, showing a commitment to the overall advancement of the project.

### Export Promotion of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Made from Uncertified Imported Raw Cotton by the China Trust Bureau, Assisting Private Factories to Compete in the International Market

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau previously purchased uncertified imported raw cotton upon arrival at the port and entrusted it to renowned yarn factories for spinning. This is expected to be fully completed within this month and has entered the export phase according to the original plan. Besides the export of cotton yarn, most of it is exchanged for cotton cloth for export, and a small portion is exchanged for cotton textiles such as undershirts, towels, and绒毯. For the cotton cloth portion, in addition to the China Textile Construction Corporation's weaving of cloth which is contracted to be shipped to Manila in September, October, and November for a total of 150,000 bolts, the remaining will be handled by the China Trust Bureau for export. In June, contracts have already been signed for 187,100 bolts, all of which are exported by private yarn factories, including 30,000 bolts of Zhong brand sheeting, 55,000 bolts of Sipingyun sheeting, 33,000 bolts of Fugui sheeting, 2,500 bolts of Dapeng sheeting, 15,600 bolts of ABC sheeting, 4,800 bolts of Jingxi printed cloth, 50,000 bolts of Qinliangyu bleached cloth, and 6,200 bolts of Xinguang shirt poplin, totaling 172,100 bolts. There are also 1,980 bales of cotton yarn, including 300 bales of Zhong brand 21-count yarn, 150 bales of Jixiang 21-count yarn, 100 bales of Haozuo brand 21-count yarn, 200 bales of Xipai brand 20-count yarn, 880 bales of Shuangma 21-count yarn, 300 bales of Tiannv 20-count yarn, and 50 bales of 42-count yarn. The quality of the yarn and cloth from the above-mentioned private factories is excellent. However, due to domestic costs being higher than foreign selling prices, the factories are unable to export on their own. Furthermore, their brands mostly lack a foundation in foreign markets. This time, the China Trust Bureau is doing its best to promote sales for the private factories to foreign countries, allowing the yarn and cloth produced by the private factories to gain a foothold in the international market under their own brands. In the future, they can gradually expand and compete with other countries, even with the Japanese textile industry. Therefore, the China Trust Bureau's handling of yarn and cloth exports is of great significance, not only generating foreign exchange for the government but also supporting private enterprises and opening a path for private textile exports. With the establishment of the Textile Export Committee, the China Trust Bureau has stated that if progress is smooth, there is hope for even greater exports of yarn and cloth spun from the aforementioned uncertified imported raw cotton in November. According to statistics, the China Trust Bureau's export regions include Hong Kong, Rome, Aden, Basra, the Persian Gulf, Iraq, Syria, Batavia, Singapore, and Manila.

### Further Increase in Negotiated Cotton Yarn Prices, Active Yarn and Cloth Market, Smooth Sales of Fine Yarn with Price Rebound

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Cotton Yarn Price Adjustment Committee (紡調會) adjusted cotton yarn prices again yesterday, raising the negotiated price for 20-count yarn to 19.85 million yuan, an increase of 950,000 yuan. Prices for other counts of yarn were also calculated separately according to the ratio and market conditions.

The China Textile Construction Corporation sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 868 bales, with 1,334.5 bales of 20-count yarn. All were sold to manufacturers, with 246 applicants.

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market sentiment shifted from weary to firm, with active buyers and a sudden improvement in the market. Fine yarn sales were particularly brisk, resulting in a rebound of 900,000 yuan for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn compared to the previous day, reaching 33.5 million yuan. Prices for other counts of coarse and fine yarn varied by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan up or down.

The cotton cloth market had been hovering for many days, and most floating inventories had been cleared. Strong buyers, seeing low prices, were searching for goods, and with the increase in negotiated prices for China Textile Construction Corporation cotton yarn, market sentiment suddenly became firm and bullish, with new buyers also active. Finally, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths rebounded by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen Drill (四君子嗶嘰) purchases by Cantonese dealers rose by 25,000 yuan, and most other cloth markets also became firmer.

Raw Cotton Remains Flat

Yesterday, raw cotton transactions were sparse, and the market was lackluster. Yarn factories still had intentions to buy, but prices were not high, leading to stalled transactions. Dealers had slight interest, but transactions were not active. Market prices were the same as the previous day, with a total of 830 bales transacted. Factory delivery prices only opened for one transaction, with Hankou Grade 2 at 2.81 million yuan. Warehouse delivery prices opened at 3.76 million yuan for Lingbao, 2.98 million yuan for Guide, 3.24 million yuan for Qidong, 3.59 million yuan for Shashi, and 330 bales of Hankou fine cotton. Huo Ji opened at 2.5 million yuan and 2.56 million yuan, and Zhoupu cottonseed cotton was at 596,000 yuan.

### Rice Market Hovers, Flour Market Weak

Yesterday, a total of over 11,400 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Stores were more willing to purchase, and the market was slightly more active. Japonica and Indica round-grained rice both rose by 10,000 yuan, reaching over 10,000 yuan. Yin Yuan (陰元) also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with very small fluctuations, entering a hovering pattern. Flour sales were slow, returning to a weak state, falling by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Bran sales were sluggish in rural areas, plunging by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.

Soybean cakes purchased in Shantou increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories opportunistically picked up goods, and local purchases continued, with a firm market. Mung beans continued to be cleared in Nanyang, advancing by 10,000 yuan. Red beans were actively purchased by Cantonese dealers, with a firm market. Broad beans were sluggish, continuing to fall by 10,000 yuan. Cowpea oil dealers were eager to buy, raising prices by 10,000 yuan.

Sorghum arrivals continued to increase, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn from the North Sea moved but was not active, with a stable market. Sesame transactions were lively in the local market. Oil factories were quick to clear goods, with high-grade goods rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per day, and medium and low grades also rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were unchanged in the foreign market, with local interest still high, remaining strong.

The oil market was mixed, with crude oil continuing to fall by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan due to a large arrival from Jiangbei. Soybean oil, however, had active sales and rebounded by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil rose by varying amounts from 10,000 to 30,000 yuan.

### Government Bonds Stable, Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Government bonds were more stable yesterday, with offers for 555 and 628 series. The 503, 552, and 360 series all advanced. The C series opened at 21,600 yuan, rising from 21,400 yuan to 22,800 yuan before stabilizing. As a result, A and B series were mostly flat compared to the previous close, C series rose by 400 yuan, D series gained 600 yuan, and E series rose by 500 yuan, with a turnover of approximately 6 million yuan.

Foreign stocks were mediocre and little changed yesterday. Hong Kong-Shanghai Electric rebounded to around 6.5 yuan. Mature stocks rose slightly after reaching high prices. Ewo Yarns opened at 191,000 yuan, with a low of 190,000 yuan, reaching a high of 197,000 yuan in the middle, but still returned to the initial price at the close in the afternoon. Securities dealers were selling, while foreign merchants were buying. As a result, compared to the previous close, shipping fell by half a percent, plantations rose by half a percent, British-American Tobacco and Jardine Matheson Telephones rose slightly, while paper and Ewo Brewery fell slightly. Real Estate and Ewo Yarns were mostly flat.

### Firm Domestic Tea Prices

Yesterday in the tea market, negotiations between exporters and owners for export grades were still not smooth, resulting in an inactive market. However, domestic teas still saw strong purchasing interest from local stores and trading houses, leading to a continued increase in sales volume. Prices were also firmly supported by domestic buyers, showing consistent strength. In particular, this year's Qimen black tea and Ping Shui flag guns (平水旗槍) were less affected by the lower inventories, and the price increase continued unabated throughout the day, resulting in price increases ranging from 200,000-300,000 yuan to 500,000-600,000 yuan. It was also learned that the Changzhou area was actively purchasing low-grade Qimen black tea.

### Numerous Applications from Manufacturers for Imported Raw Materials for Straw Hats

The Export Management Committee (輸管會) has submitted the import methods for raw materials used in manufacturing export products to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Committee, considering the seasonal nature of the two straw hat materials, gold silk and thatch, has decided to handle them first. It is reported that since the Export Promotion Division (輸出推廣處) of the Committee began handling the matter last week, the progress has been excellent. As of now, more than 30 applications have been received. All straw hat merchants have been able to comply with the regulations, securing guarantees from designated banks to ensure that after the import of these raw materials and the export of the finished straw hats, each US dollar's worth of raw materials will generate 3-6 US dollars in export revenue, without depleting the country's foreign exchange reserves. After reviewing each application, the Committee will send it to the Non-Quota Review Department (非限額審核處) to issue an import permit. The merchants will then go to Manila to purchase raw materials and manufacture straw hats. It is estimated that exports can begin in two months. Before the war, these exports were valued at approximately 2 million US dollars annually. Unofficial estimates indicate that they can also generate 2 million US dollars this time, restoring pre-war performance. The straw hat production areas in China are Haimen and Yuyao in Zhejiang Province, and Changshu in Jiangsu Province. These are all rural side industries, with very delicate craftsmanship that is popular among European and American women, so sales are not a problem.

### Buying Sentiment Difficult to Sustain; Chinese Stocks Fall After Initial Surge

Yesterday, major securities firms showed buying interest in Chinese stocks, buoyed by the encouragement of reduced margin requirements. However, the market still felt isolated and lacked widespread participation. Although there was a temporary rally mid-session, it proved difficult to sustain. The afternoon release of the cost of living index fueled underlying concerns, and sellers seized the opportunity to suppress buying sentiment, leading to a gradual decline after the initial surge.

Morning Session

The market initially felt somewhat subdued due to loan-related news. However, the report of reduced margin requirements sparked renewed activity, leading to higher opening prices. Wing On Textiles opened steadily around 283 yuan, with forward contracts rising from 292 yuan to 294 yuan. Subsequently, it retreated to 279 yuan and 289 yuan before rising again to 284 yuan and 294 yuan. Trading volume remained light, and speculative fervor was not high. Consequently, although off-market interest rates opened lower at 1.5 fen and 1.95 fen, the market remained range-bound with little significant change. It then rose again to 285 yuan and 296 yuan. With supply readily available for immediate delivery, those settling forward contracts slightly lowered their bids. News of the opening of the Tianjin Stock Exchange and the entry of banking groups provided a boost, driving the market higher by midday to 289 yuan for immediate delivery and breaking the 300 yuan mark for forward contracts. Guangdong firms offered shares, and Jardine Matheson also sold immediate delivery contracts, further contributing to the market's pullback. The midday close was 288 yuan and 298 yuan. China United led the gains, followed by China Silk, Sino-French, and China General Edison. Most popular stocks remained stable. Compared to the previous closing prices, immediate delivery stocks generally rose by 10%, while Sino-French, China Silk, and China General Edison rose by 5%. China Textile, China Xingye, Match, Lihua, and Xinyi remained flat. National Goods experienced a slight decline. Most other stocks rose slightly, with forward contracts showing a rise of about 5% for Xinhua and China Merchants Union, while others rose only marginally.

### Deposit and Reserve Amounts of Banks and Financial Institutions in This City for September

[Our Dispatch] According to a report released by the Auditing Department of the Central Bank, a comparison of the total deposit and reserve amounts of various banks and financial institutions in this city for September of this year shows that the total deposit amount was 1,468,623,653.627 yuan, of which 1,343,147,471.858 yuan was demand deposits and 125,146,181.768 yuan was time deposits. The total amount of paid-in reserves was 214,127,502.131 yuan, which is comparable to the amounts for August.

### Rayon Recovers; Silk Goods from Factories Sell Well

After consecutive days of fatigue, rayon rebounded yesterday. In the morning, 120 denier "Asahi" brand rayon opened steadily. However, due to strong buying interest from various parties, prices rose steadily, with the highest bid reaching 82 million yuan. At the midday close, prices retreated to 80.3 million yuan. The afternoon session was slightly weaker, with the final selling price at 79 million yuan.

Factory Silk

The market was quite active yesterday, with silk goods selling very well. Transaction prices were significantly higher than the previous day, rising by 1 million yuan. Grade C, five-bale lots were priced at 65 million yuan, 3 million yuan higher per bale. Medium-grade silk was 1.5 million to 2 million yuan higher per bale. Raw silk sales were relatively sluggish, and prices were also higher than the previous day. Top-grade raw silk traded at 43 million to 44 million yuan per bale.

Afternoon Session

Wing On Textiles once reached highs of 293 yuan and 301 yuan. However, due to concerns about the rising cost of living index and talk of panic among textile mills, selling pressure emerged, and buyers became hesitant. Unfavorable exchange rates further pushed prices down to lows of 281 yuan and 289 yuan for immediate delivery. Immediate delivery prices then rose slightly to 283 yuan, while forward contracts closed at 289 yuan. Popular stocks experienced slight declines, while miscellaneous stocks remained stable. In particular, New Asia, with limited trading volume, jumped significantly. Compared to the previous close, only New Asia immediate delivery shares rose by 10%, while China Textile, Innerwear, King Fung, Match experienced moderate increases. China General Edison, Anheng remained flat. Wing On Textiles, Xinyi, Le Xing, Meiya, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, towels, Sino-French, Xinhua, Huaxin, Xinyi, China Silk, Rong Kang all experienced small declines. Among forward delivery stocks, Wing On Textiles, Xinyi, Meiya, Jingfu, and Qinxing experienced slight declines, with Xinguang falling slightly less than half a percent. Outside of these, old stocks, including Chinese Merchant Securities, had favorable news. Bank stocks were heavily sought after by major investors, and news of cultural stocks being listed also led to gains.

Silk Goods

Yesterday's market was brisk due to rising raw material costs. Silk quilt covers from Dashunxing and Huaqiang opened around 2.4 million yuan, then rose to around 2.45 million yuan, briefly surging to an immediate price of 2.6 million yuan. Ultimately, due to sustained buying interest, prices soared to over 2.7 million yuan, with some buying at 2.9 million yuan for next-day delivery. The rising cost of living index inevitably increased the cost of silk goods, leading to positive sentiment. Other goods also remained firm.

### Fourth Quarter Import Quotas Postponed to Next Week

The third-quarter quotas of the Import and Export Management Committee expired yesterday. The fourth-quarter import quotas were scheduled to be announced this morning. However, because the National Economic Council has not yet finalized the figures for the fourth-quarter quotas, the announcement cannot be made this morning and will be postponed until next week.

Although the Committee's third-quarter quotas have expired, most have not yet been allocated. In addition, some of the first and second-quarter quotas have not yet been fully allocated. Therefore, the Committee is currently strengthening its allocation efforts. The delayed announcement of the fourth-quarter quotas will have no impact on the situation.

### Cotton Merchants in Various Regions Plan to Form a Federation

The national cotton industry trade association has designated the trade associations in Nantong, Hankou, Shashi, and Shanghai as initiators to prepare for and promote industry participation in order to consolidate the organization of the national cotton merchant trade association, seek to expand the industry's business, and promote the welfare of the industry. It is reported that the local side has designated Liu Ping-sun, Zhang Qiliang, Tang Shuming, Shi Cheng-sun, and twelve others as preparatory committee members, and representatives from various regions will also arrive in Shanghai within days to jointly discuss preparatory matters and register with the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It is expected that the association will be officially established in December.

### Overcoating Fabric Prices Rise Again

The Industrial Loan Review Committee of the National Bank Discount Committee held its 30th meeting yesterday, reviewing 38 industrial loan applications and approving 29 applications, totaling 8.56 billion yuan.

The domestic medicine market was slightly more active in the past two days. Rehmannia glutinosa and Achyranthes bidentata have been affected by the war, and the supply has been cut off, resulting in demand exceeding supply. 16-count Rehmannia glutinosa suddenly jumped to 16,000 yuan, and small Rehmannia glutinosa to 9,000 yuan. The market is expected to continue to rise.

Yesterday, the cigarette market was strong. Ten-pack "Taiying Old Knife" rose by 500,000 yuan to 4.7 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other Chinese and foreign brand cigarettes and fifty-pack canned "Men" also rose by 1,000 to 4,000 yuan.

The market for daily necessities is firm, with various brands of soap rising by 3,000 to 6,000 yuan. Matches, "Meili Phoenix" also rose by 100,000 to 50,000 yuan, while miscellaneous brands remained stable.

The wood market is slightly firmer, as sales have loosened and buyers are taking advantage of lower prices.

### In Memory of Journalist Mr. Yu Songhua

— Lü Zhu

Mr. Yu Songhua, a senior figure in journalism, passed away in Suzhou on October 11. The news of his death has caused grief in all quarters. All sectors of Suzhou have scheduled a memorial service to be held at the Humble Administrator's Garden on November 2 and have decided to bury Mr. Yu's remains in the scenic Lingyan Mountain in Tiaocheng, so that tourists can pay their respects.

Mr. Yu was born in the 19th year before the Republic of China. He studied in Japan in his early years. In the 8th year of the Republic of China, he was invited by Mr. Zhang Dongsun to join the Shishi Xinbao as the editor-in-chief of the "Xuedeng" supplement. This was the beginning of his participation in journalism, which has lasted for thirty years. He later served as the editor-in-chief of the Jiefang and Gaizao magazines, introducing new Western ideas such as utopia and democracy. During this time, he also traveled extensively to the Soviet Union, Germany, and various Eastern European countries. In Germany, he also studied at the University of Berlin. After returning to China, he served as the Dean of Academic Affairs at China Public School, with Hu Shi as the president. During his spare time, he began to edit the Dongfang Zazhi. After the "January 28th Incident," he joined the Shen Bao, initially editing the Shen Bao Monthly and Weekly, and later becoming the chief editor. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Hu Wenhu invited him to Guangzhou to found the Xingyue Daily, but it did not materialize due to the turbulent situation. In the 29th year, he went to Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily to serve as the chief editor, and later was invited to Singapore to serve as the editor-in-chief of the Sin Chew Daily. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he disguised himself and escaped, successively serving as the editor-in-chief of the Guangxi Daily and the Hengyang Dagang Daily. Throughout his life, except for part-time teaching positions, he never left the journalism field. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he went to Suzhou to head the Journalism Department of the National Social Education College, still diligently cultivating talents for the journalism field. Who knew that his plans would not be completed, and he would pass away first? This is not only a regret for Mr. Yu but also a great loss for our journalism community.

My acquaintance with Mr. Yu began this summer. Four years ago, while in Chongqing, I felt that social mores were deteriorating and people were listless, so I continuously wrote articles in the Xuedeng introducing the ideals of utopia and elaborating on the philosophies of Eugen and Bergson, which unknowingly coincided with Mr. Yu's style twenty years ago. Therefore, I developed admiration for Mr. Yu. This summer, I heard that Mr. Yu was recuperating in Shanghai, so I made a special trip to visit him. He had just recovered from his illness. We started by discussing the soaring domestic prices at the time and talked all the way to world issues. Although it was my first time meeting him, I felt no sense of unfamiliarity. Mr. Yu was talkative, and his topics were endless. We talked for more than four hours. Mr. Yu was very sensitive and also very emotional. When talking about the domestic situation, he repeatedly said sadly: Most of the Chinese people are suffering too much. All conscientious intellectuals should sacrifice a little themselves and do more for the people. When talking about journalism practitioners, Mr. Yu said very objectively: A true journalism practitioner should have no party affiliation. Only with no party affiliation can they be impartial. A true journalism practitioner is faithful in analysis and criticism. The key to analysis and criticism lies in having no biased views. Therefore, Mr. Yu himself, until his death, remained a non-partisan, pure national citizen.

It is said that Mr. Yu's body was originally very weak, and after escaping from Hong Kong, he experienced hardship and traveled on the Xiang-Gui Road and Qian-Gui Road. Mr. Yu's frail body had already planted the cause of his death through this ordeal. After the victory, due to high prices, Mr. Yu's entire family worked, but Mr. Yu was unable to receive better care. Mr. Yu's monthly teaching income in Suzhou was less than one million yuan. His daily medicines were supplied by Mr. Yu's wife (Mrs. Yu worked at the Central Bank) through her savings. Mr. Yu's illness was caused by overwork, but if he could have received a little more care, he would not have passed away so suddenly. I mourn Mr. Yu's death, I regret Mr. Yu's early death, the journalism community has suffered an immeasurable loss, society has suffered an endless loss, and today's society has a responsibility—October 30th in Shanghai.

### In Memory of Yu Songhua

— Chu Yusheng

Mr. Yu was an old colleague of this newspaper. He joined the Shen Bao in the 21st year of the Republic of China, specializing in editing the monthly magazine. According to Mr. Pan Shenchang, an old colleague: "I was in charge of the magazine's distribution at that time, and the threshold was always crowded. In less than five days, we had already subscribed to 100,000 copies." Because the Shen Bao Monthly edited by Mr. Yu at that time vigorously exposed Japan's aggression. To have a periodical with a circulation of over 100,000 copies is probably only the Shen Bao Monthly edited by Mr. Yu!

Mr. Yu's body was very frail, and he was also very short in stature. When we were in Nanwenquan, Chongqing, we often went to see him. He was teaching at the Journalism Department of the Central Political School and was always kind in explaining everything to us. He lived in a small thatched cottage, truly a so-called "small room." We knew he was very poor, but when we went to his place, we always had fragrant tea and peanuts to eat.

Later, I often went to Chongqing, and he lived in Zhangjia Garden, which required climbing many slopes. I often went to see him, and he often came to see me. I asked him what mode of transportation he used, and he patted his own two legs. When I thought about him having to climb such high slopes and walk such a long distance, I almost shed tears.

In June of the 36th year, I saw him in Suzhou. His body was even worse. His voice was no longer as bright as before, and his back was even more hunched, but he still had unparalleled ambition and vigor.

I heard that he unfortunately died on October 11. My meeting with him in Suzhou was our last encounter. How can society not take good care of such a knowledgeable and upright person, allowing him to suffer the insults of frost and snow? Whose responsibility is this?

### On Deaf-Muteness

— Ya Qiang

Previously, I saw a newspaper report stating that the Legislative Yuan claimed that deaf-mute people have the right to be elected as National Assembly representatives. This regulation not only conforms to the meaning of "democracy" but can also eliminate the usual general public's contempt and indifference towards deaf-mute people.

The general public despises deaf-mute people because they cannot "hear" or "speak," which is truly ignorant. This defect can be compensated for among deaf-mute people. As soon as deaf-mute children enter school, they learn to "read," and each word and phrase is represented by a hand gesture. The more they read, the more gestures they learn, and they can communicate their ideas to each other as they wish, just like ordinary people talking. As for those who have not received education, there are also some common gestures to replace language. Although deaf-mute people are "disabled," they have places where they are "superior" to ordinary people. The author has seen third-grade students at deaf-mute schools copy portraits of people, vividly and realistically, and the artwork of fifth and sixth-grade students is much more outstanding than that of ordinary middle school students. Many graduates of deaf-mute schools are excellent advertising painters, set designers, sculptors, and other art workers. Because they do not have the annoyance of "sound," they have unique ingenuity, and their artistic achievements are indeed one notch above ordinary people.

According to researchers of deaf-mute education, deaf-mute people can be said to have no other desires besides "warm clothes and full stomachs." Unlike ordinary people who, in addition to "sufficient food and clothing," indulge in "sensual pleasures" and compete for "fame and wealth," only to earn endless worries and pains. Deaf-mute people do not have these desires, which reduces a lot of suffering. Their mood is much calmer than that of ordinary people.

The world is muddy, and people's hearts are unpredictable. Those with pure will cannot help but sigh and be depressed. If they were deaf-mute, they would hear and ask less, which could reduce a lot of mental "punishment." Using their precious energy on lofty art, beautifying "life," and contributing to humanity, in this way, deaf-mute people should not only not be despised, but should also be admired.

### Feng Dao's Humor

— Liu Yun

During the Five Dynasties period, Feng Xiang (Dao) and Xiang (Ning) were both in the Chancellery. One day, Xiang asked Feng, "How much did you pay for your new boots?" Feng raised his left foot and showed Xiang and said, "Nine hundred." Xiang was impatient and quickly looked back at the clerk and said, "How did my boots cost eighteen hundred?" He scolded him. After a while, Feng slowly raised his right foot and said, "This one is also nine hundred." Then everyone laughed. (Gui Tian Lu)

### The Life of a Official in the Capital

— Yi Feng

"Don't say you're not saddened; the wind from the west rolls up the curtains, and you are thinner than the yellow flowers."

Quoting these three lines from Li Qingzhao to describe the demeanor of the average civil servant in the capital today is truly the most appropriate. Especially after the Mid-Autumn Festival, the "October wind," like a surging tide of "prices" rising upwards, has made these officials, struggling in poverty, jump through a volcano once more. Although they have been somewhat settled, "Nanjing" has become "Nan"jing, how can they not become even thinner!

Originally, I would not mention it, but the life of the average official in the capital, apart from those few who are more capable and can still live in Western-style buildings and travel by car, most of them are afraid of living in poverty. Autumn is deep, and those who "the whole family is in the west wind, and the winter clothes have not yet been cut" are a large number.

The life of the officials in the capital is also very dry and monotonous. Seven or eight hours a day on a cold bench, doesn't that make people feel tired and bored? When the sky is still in the hazy scenery, those who live far away from the office have to get up and catch the transportation bus. If the wife is not greedy for sleep, she may not have to go into the kitchen to cook breakfast herself, otherwise, she has to do it herself. After getting off work and going home, if you are a father, then you also have to take on the responsibility of a nanny, fulfilling your obligations to your wife. If the seven things run out, you have to solve the nineteen yourself. As the saying goes, "Poor couples are sad in everything." The more difficult the situation, the worse the mood, and the family's quarrels become commonplace.

If we say that the difficulty of making a living is the first threat to the minds of officials in the capital, then the "housing shortage" is undoubtedly the second obstacle. The so-called "housing shortage" here is not really that there are no houses, but that they cannot afford to live in them. There are so many large and small institutions in the capital, but the organs that provide dormitories are rare. Single men may have organ dormitories to live in, but those with dependents are almost non-existent. A few public education new villages can only accommodate 10% of the people, and they have already been taken by those who got there first. It seems that there are many empty high-rise buildings, and the Western-style houses built in the past year are also erected everywhere, but the deposit of more than 10 million yuan is not something that small officials in the capital, who have difficulty making a living, can afford. Even the worst bungalow will require a rent deposit of 1 or 2 million yuan at a time, which is already a considerable amount. In this way, having no place to live makes the average person who has left their families in their hometowns dare not think of "reunion."

### On Gambling on Mahjong

— Zhu Mei

Among the forms of gambling popular among Chinese people, besides old-fashioned playing cards, mahjong has the longest history. In terms of popularity, mahjong is also the number one. Not only has it traveled to Europe and America, but it was also once one of the national forms of gambling in Japan. Mahjong is also known as mahjong sparrow. Although there are various accounts of its origin, there is no doubt that the inventor must have been from Zhejiang. Some researchers say that the inventor's surname was Zhong and his given name was Fa Bai, but I think this is just speculation. Just like the playing cards in Europe and America, it is impossible to point out who invented them, but what is certain is that they must have started as playing cards and were continuously improved.

Among gambling, new gadgets such as roulette, poker, Shahar, horse racing, and old gambling such as Pai Gow, dice, and paper mahjong, none of them have the appeal of mahjong. Today, let's calculate how much time the Chinese people sacrifice in mahjong. It is truly shocking.

Now, let's take Shanghai as an example. Assuming that Shanghai has a population of 4 million, with 4 people per household, there are 1 million households. Among the 1 million households, 200,000 households have mahjong tiles, and 100,000 households play mahjong every day. Each household playing mahjong has 4 people, so 100,000 households have 400,000 people. Each time, the minimum limit is 8 rounds, and each 4 rounds is calculated as 1.5 hours, then the time spent by 4 people in each household in one day is 12 hours. 100,000 households have 1.2 million hours, and each day has 8 working hours, which is 150,000 working days. In other words, the time wasted by 4 million households in Shanghai playing mahjong every day is a total of 150,000 working days. The average month is calculated as 30 days, so one month wastes 4.5 million days. One year has 54 million days. One year is calculated as 365 days, which is 148,000 years. Each person lives for an average of 60 years (this refers to urban people), then there are 2,466 people who live their entire lives in vain. Other cities can be inferred in the same way. What do we want to do that is not successful? The question is what to do? This depends on the self-reflection of the parties involved and the leadership of the government. I think that suppression and prohibition are not useful.

### Couplet Snippets

— Wang Bairi

When the martyr Song Jiaoren died, a certain celebrity wrote a mourning couplet for Yuan Shikai, saying: "Since Zhou Yu was born, why was Zhuge Liang born? If the hometown does not die, the solitary one is uneasy." The twelve characters are purely idioms from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which is extremely appropriate. The so-called article is inherently natural, and the wonderful hand gets it occasionally. It is true! But it is also cruel.

The author of the Pipa Ji, Gao Ming, courtesy name Ze Cheng, was from Yongjia, Zhejiang. He was extraordinary at the age of six or seven. A neighboring minister, dressed in scarlet robes, came out to see off a guest. Ze Cheng happened to be returning from a teacher, dressed in green clothes. The minister joked, "A frog out of the water wears a green jacket, with beautiful eyes and anticipation." Ze Cheng responded, "A shrimp out of the soup wears a red robe, bowing in reverence." The minister was greatly surprised and called him a child prodigy.

In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I passed through the Chongren Guan in the western countryside of Cixi and saw a couplet in front of the paper furnace: "Today ascending to heaven relies on cremation, in those years falling to the ground made a golden sound." With the current situation in front of me, I realized the reality of the whole year, using the word "fire" to lead to the following word "gold." It can be said to be extremely stable. It is not possible without a skillful hand.

Miss America

### Miss America's Summer Life

— Xu Shuyuan

Summer is the most active season for American women. Women known for their healthy beauty can only fully flaunt their curves during summer. Therefore, summer becomes the world of American women. Other women, French, British, and Chinese, can only hide their flaws in summer, unwilling to expose their slight waists and entire rib cages for others to admire. There are many ways for Miss America to flaunt her curves, with clothing being the most important. First, let's talk about pants. One type is Slack pants, which are loose-fitting thigh pants with loose waistbands, completely different from Western-style pants and similar to the long pants worn by Chinese women. These pants are the easiest to accentuate the beauty of the hips because they are tightly fitted above the crotch, thanks to the thoughtful design of the designers. As for tops, there are Spanish-style short-sleeved, open-chested chiffon shirts, tight-fitting sweat shirts that make the two peaks of the chest appear particularly high, backless half-dress outfits that resemble the upper part of women's formal dresses, and summer casual wear similar to swimsuits. In short, they try to accentuate the curves of the chest, hips, and legs as much as possible. They have many kinds of activities in summer. Swimming pools are their daily must-go place. Even those who cannot swim wear swimsuits and drink Coca-Cola in the pool-side tea room, flirting and having fun with male guests.

In coastal cities, pairs of young men and women sleeping under sun umbrellas on the beach are common. They bring travel chairs, beer, sandwiches, and soda, spending the entire afternoon on the scorching beach. They certainly can't cool off on the scorching beach, obviously to flaunt their healthy beauty, tanning their skin to a chestnut color, Sun-tanred. If the skin is too pale and not healthy enough, they have to buy a bottle of chestnut-colored paint and apply it all over the body, pretending to be healthy. If you have a close girlfriend, you may notice that she is always worried that her skin is not tanned enough and will go to the beach and park to take off her outerwear completely, wearing only a pair of swimming socks, covering her face with a handkerchief, lying flat on the beach or grass to sunbathe. They don't cry even if they get sunburned, because they have to put in such hard work for beauty and health, even if their skin peels off.

Skating rinks are also places where Miss America flaunts her health and beauty. Skating is a good opportunity to show off the beauty of the thighs, and skating skills depend entirely on the legs. Once skating skills are mastered, the thighs will naturally become healthy and beautiful. We can hardly find a skater whose thighs are not well-developed. The skating posture also helps to correct the beauty of the chest and waist. People who can skate must have a particularly high chest and a particularly straight waist. Skating is most helpful for the development of muscles below the waist, so women who can skate are often the most ideal lovers. American women list skating, swimming, and dancing as compulsory subjects for developing health and beauty.

### Airplanes Should Be Called "厶"

— Zheng Dakang

Currently, the library already has "　" as a single-character name, and today's airplanes in the sky, like boats and vehicles on land and water, are both important for transportation, but there is no single-character proper name. Only the character "機" (ji, machine) is used to represent them, but the character "機" has many uses, such as the "機" (ji) in "機器" (jiqi, machine) and the "機" (ji) in "機會" (jihui, opportunity). Examining idioms, there are originally phrases like "乘機下野" (chenji xiaye, take the opportunity to retire) and "乘機出走" (chenji chuzou, take the opportunity to flee), "乘機××" (chenji ××, take the opportunity to ××), etc. Under today's prevalence of airplanes, misunderstandings are inevitable. Therefore, the creation of a single character for "airplane" is necessary. Checking the Kangxi Dictionary's "Bei Kao" (備考), "Chou Ji" (丑集), "Si Bu" (厶部), there is the character "　" (si), which sounds "jian" but has no meaning. Using it as the single-character proper name for "airplane" is very appropriate. Not only is the sound the same, but the upper part of the character, "厶" (si), resembles the propeller of an airplane, and the middle "一" (yi) resembles the wings, and "—" resembles the fuselage, making it a coincidental pictographic character. From this, we can infer that the "航" (hang) in "航空" (hangkong, aviation) can also be created as a "航" (hang) character to distinguish it from the "航" (hang) in "航船" (hangchuan, ship). In the future, if we use "　" (si) to represent "機" (ji, machine) and "航" (hang), not only will the meaning of the characters be clear, but the strokes will be simple, and writing will be more convenient.
