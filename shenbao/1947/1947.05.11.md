### Economic Commission Discusses Price Stabilization, Grain Source Smoothing, and Index Restoration; Shanghai Wage Adjustment Measures Passed

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Economic Commission's Price Commission held its sixth routine meeting at the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 10th. Attendees included Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Yu Dawei, Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, Zhang Jia'ao, Wu Guozhen, Shen Yi, Gan Naiguang, Pang Songzhou, Chen Kewen, and Chairman Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. Regarding grain, the following was decided: (1) Earnestly protect legitimate grain merchants and rice shops, enabling them to operate as usual. (2) Strictly prohibit local authorities from restricting transportation, allowing free flow of grain, balancing surpluses and deficits. Those who obstruct or extort under false pretenses will be severely punished. (3) Strive to smooth grain sources in the interior, enabling surplus grain from Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, and other provinces to supply Nanjing, Shanghai, and other areas. Regarding the issue of Shanghai workers' wages, the "Provisional Measures for Adjusting Shanghai Workers' Wages" submitted by the Ministry of Social Affairs were revised and passed.

[Another Dispatch] The Economic Commission's Price Meeting on the 10th revised and passed the "Provisional Measures for Adjusting Shanghai Workers' Wages" as follows: (1) Starting from May 1947, workers' wages in all industries will be calculated and paid monthly according to the index, in accordance with these measures. (2) The base wage must not be changed under any circumstances. If changes have occurred after the implementation of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the original amount should be restored. (3) For those with base wages below 30 yuan, wages will be paid in full according to the index. (4) For those with base wages above 30 yuan up to 100 yuan, in addition to the 30 yuan paid in full according to the index, the remaining portion will be discounted by 10% for each 10 yuan increment. (5) If, due to poor production or business conditions, employers genuinely cannot afford to pay wages according to Articles 3 to 5 of these measures, they may reduce them through labor-management agreement. If an agreement cannot be reached, the labor-management arbitration board will decide. (6) Before the promulgation of these measures, if labor and management in various industries have already reached agreements on the discount method for paying wages according to the index, their agreements may be followed. (7) From the date of implementation of these measures, subsidies for the difference in rationing of goods will be immediately discontinued.

Authorities Consider Using Vouchers to Purchase Grain; Military Grain Quotas to be Gradually Reduced

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is heard that some individuals within the government advocate using vouchers to purchase grain to address the current grain issue. Premier Zhang also pointed out the inappropriateness of selling off grain when reporting to the Political Council yesterday, and stated that the government intends to expand the scope of grain rationing, so that police, workers, and civilians all have the opportunity to purchase grain. The voucher system is indeed the most effective method for expanding rationing. It is said that although the voucher system is best suited for wartime, it is still used in England and Hong Kong. Implementing this system universally in our country may have technical aspects that require study, but in the current situation, this is the only effective way to stabilize grain prices and eliminate rice rushes in various regions.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The General Manager of the China Grain Company, Tan, stated that the company plans to establish four bases nationwide to universally adjust surpluses and deficits: one in Changsha, to adjust the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway to Guangzhou; one in Wuxi, to adjust Beijing and Shanghai; one in Wuhu, to adjust Northeast and North China; and one in Jiujiang, to adjust the Southwest.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The national military grain quota for May has been reduced by one-fifth compared to April. It will continue to be gradually reduced to avoid affecting civilian food supplies.

### Northern Communist Troops from Songhua River Move South; Northeast Situation Becomes Tense Again; Communists Simultaneously Prevent Defections of Ma Zhanshan's Former Troops

[This Newspaper, Changchun, 10th] The Northeast Communist troops are restless again, with frequent mobilizations and active deployments in recent days. Approximately 70,000 Communist troops are gathered in the Shulan and Xiushuidianzi areas, known to include the Independent 1st Division, 6th Division, 16th Division, 17th Division, New 20th Division, 2nd Police Brigade, and 5th Police Brigade. A force of 100,000 troops is massed in the Dalai and Fuyu areas, including the 4th Division, 5th Division, Matsuda Unit, Mongolian Cavalry, and six other armies. They are about to launch an offensive on the Jilin-Changchun area from both the east and west, claiming they will launch an offensive mid-month. The Songhua River front remains relatively calm, but Communist troops have transported several trainloads of wooden boats from Qiqihar to Shuangcheng, preparing to cross the river.

[This Newspaper, Changchun, 10th] Small groups of Communist troops invaded Youjiatun, 35 kilometers northeast of Jilin. They made contact with National troops on the evening of the 8th, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.

National troops are on high alert.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 10th] The northwest corner of the Jilin-Changchun area, which had been calm for over fifty days, is now tense again. Large numbers of Communist troops transported south along the (Qiqihar to Siping) railway from north of the Songhua River are actively deploying at Baicheng, along the diagonal line between Dalai and Qian Gorlos Banner. The Changchun-Taonan Railway south of Dalai, which was completely dismantled by the Communist troops last summer, is now being temporarily repaired, seemingly in preparation for strengthening supply efforts in the northern section of the Changchun-Taonan Railway. It is generally expected that after the Songhua River thaws, the Communist troops will threaten the Jilin-Changchun area with pressure from both the east and west ends.

[Another Dispatch] General Ma Zhanshan has long been trusted by the people of the Northeast. Former puppet Manchukuo soldiers reorganized by the Communist troops greatly admire him. Now that General Ma has taken office in the Northeast, it is inevitable that lower-level Communist cadres will undergo changes. Lu Zhengcao, Zhang Xueshi, and others specifically convened a meeting of over one hundred regional commanders and political commissars on the 20th of last month at the former Songjiang Provincial Government in Nangang. Chairman Li Lisan discussed detailed measures to prevent Ma's troops from defecting: (1) Thoroughly investigate and monitor Ma's former troops and personnel strength. (2) Issue orders to front-line troops in subordinate areas to pay close attention, and reward officers and soldiers who discover any defections. According to someone familiar with the situation in the Northeast, Ma's former troops in the northern Manchuria area number over 300,000.

### Pro-Democracy Elements in the Chinese Communist Party Launch Anti-Mao Movement

[Central News Agency, this City] Since Mao Zedong insisted on launching the civil war, pro-democracy elements within the Chinese Communist Party have launched a fierce anti-Mao movement, resolutely opposing Mao Zedong's policy of seizing power through armed struggle, and demanding that Mao end his leftist opportunist struggles. Propaganda materials for this anti-Mao movement have been discovered in various places. Another document, titled "Four Seasons Song," issued by the Propaganda Department of the "Emergency Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Suluyu Border Region Party Committee," set to the tune of the folk song "Meng Jiangnu," expresses undisguised hatred for Mao Zedong's warmongering, which has harmed the country and the people. The original lyrics are as follows:

(1) In springtime, cannons roar red,
   Mao Zedong has risen in China,
   Grasping for power and selfish desires,
   Causing unrest among the people.

(2) In summertime, the great war begins,
   How many militiamen become cannon fodder?
   The Mao bandits are determined to seize the country,
   Regardless of the people suffering from war.

(3) In autumn, great disaster descends,
   The Eighth Route and New Fourth Armies are deployed,
   Alas, the sacrifice is great in battle,
   The people suffer, it is heartbreaking.

(4) In winter, famine rages,
   The people hunger and suffer,
   As long as we unite against the Mao bandits,
   Everyone will live and work in peace.

Printed by the Propaganda Department of the Emergency Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Suluyu Border Region Party Committee.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The National Army recaptured Laiwu at noon on the 10th, and the war situation in Shandong Province took a sharp turn for the better. The National Army has gained an overall advantage. An observer here stated: "If the Shandong war situation is resolved, it can be said that seven-tenths of the war within the borders has been completed." In the Battle of Laiwu, the National Army defeated the Communist 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 14th Columns, inflicting over 20,000 casualties. Many spoils of war were seized, especially a large amount of supplies in the Xintai, Mengyin, and Boshan areas.

By this point, the highways of Taian, Laiwu, Xintai, Mengyin, and Linyi were like sharp swords, cutting the Yimeng Mountain area into two.

### China and the Philippines Urge MacArthur to Increase Pressure to Force Japan to Hand Over Looted Goods; U.S. Opposes Using Japanese Assets for Occupation Costs

[United Press, Western Japan Investigation, 10th dispatch on "Looted Goods" train] Today, representatives from China and the Philippines jointly urged MacArthur's headquarters to increase pressure and force Japan to return property looted during the war to various countries. Wu Bannong, head of the Compensation Group of the Chinese Delegation to Japan, said that the war trophies reported by Japan to international investigators to date only cover the surface of China's losses during the Japanese occupation. MacArthur should continue his efforts and increase pressure on Japan to hand them over. Filipino delegation to the reparations committee, Abolera, suggested that MacArthur should strictly order the return of the properties looted by Japan. Based on what he had seen during his weeks of travel in Japan, he knew that Japan had not effectively complied with the order to return the property. Representatives from other countries also expressed the same view. The Allied countries lost no less than 1,500 ships seized by Japan, but only 70 have been found so far. According to Chinese officials, of the 120 ships looted by Japan from China, only four have been returned. The United Kingdom lost no less than 1,300 ships, of which only one has been returned. Some of the 70 ships reported by the Japanese side have already sunk, but they can still be salvaged. One is a 10,000-ton British freighter, salvaged on the northern coast of Honshu, and the other is the 18,000-ton Italian ship Conte Verde, which is also aground in the same port. The ship was sunk in Shanghai in 1943 by Italian sailors, and later salvaged and used by the Japanese.

[United Press, Osaka, 10th] According to Wu Bannong, he asked the Allied headquarters to apply greater pressure and search museums, libraries, and private collections, as these places could also be hiding places for looted goods. One paper mill and one nitric acid plant have already been found and will soon be shipped back to China.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] According to well-informed sources in diplomatic circles today, the Far Eastern Commission will soon announce its decision to approve the United States' application to oppose the use of Japan's current assets to pay for occupation costs and food relief. The United States has been fighting for this move in the Far Eastern Commission for months, seeking the commission's approval of the U.S. application.

Allied Investigation Team to Search Moats of Imperial Palace for Loot

[United Press, Special train on the south coast of Honshu, 10th] Representatives of the Allied investigation team now in southern Japan told reporters that the authorities may excavate the moats surrounding the Tokyo Imperial Palace to search for gold, silver, and other looted goods that the Japanese army may have hidden there during the war. The Allies are currently conducting a large-scale search for billions of dollars worth of looted goods, which the Japanese seized from various Allied countries during the war and are believed to still be hidden in Japan. Excavating the moats is part of the search effort. The Japanese have been ordered to hand over these items, but Allied officials believe that only a small portion has been received to date. Some investigation team representatives advocate using mine detectors to search for looted goods on land, as this method has been quite effective in Germany.

The Soviet Union did not send a representative to the investigation team this time, claiming that it was not prepared at present. Representatives from China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, the Philippines, and the Netherlands have set off for southern Japan and all agree to continue their efforts to search during the occupation period, as once the peace treaty with Japan is signed, there is little hope of recovering anything that was not specified beforehand.

### On the Issue of Japanese Reparations, Wu Bannong Discusses China's Needs, Hoping to Obtain Immediately Applicable Materials

[United Press, Osaka, 10th] Dr. Wu Bannong, head of the Chinese delegation to Japan, said: "China hopes to extract reparations from Japan's current production. China needs to obtain immediately applicable materials from Japan. In addition to food, China also hopes to immediately obtain all daily necessities as part of the reparations it deserves, such as cloth, locomotives, steel rails, and other materials produced by Japanese factories."

Dr. Wu believes that Japan will never be able to pay all the prescribed reparations. He also knows that Japan must be allowed to maintain a fairly low standard of living. Wu continued: Among the factories currently available for reparations, China needs power plants, hardware tools, factories, shipyards, and chemical plants. The factories obtained through reparations should be distributed throughout the country according to the five-year plan drawn up by Chinese and American experts. The Chinese reparations delegation has visited several factories and found that some of them are of no value to China, while others are of great value, but China lacks ships to transport these factories back home.

China is very disappointed that only a small number of 50-cycle power plants are listed on the Allied headquarters' temporary reparations list. Japan can simultaneously use 50-cycle and 60-cycle power plants, while China uses 50-cycle as the standard. China needs several of these factories, but there are too few that are applicable, so there is virtually no choice.

China also needs iron mills to compensate for the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant that the Soviet Union moved away in the Northeast. China is drafting a reparations list, but the work is very difficult because China's losses from Japan are too great to estimate at this time.

China is eager to cooperate with the Allied headquarters to stabilize the Japanese economy and is planning to supply Japan with coal, coke, and iron ore in exchange for Japanese steel products. It is hoped that this trade can be completed in the near future.

### China's Five-Member Team to Japan Named Reparations Delegation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] China's five-member executive team sent to Japan for reparations matters has now been officially named the Chinese Reparations and Restitution Delegation. In its affairs, it liaises with the Allied Headquarters Reparations Executive Office and the Civilian Materials Custody Group to implement reparations matters. The five-member executive team was established in February this year based on the recommendation of the Allied Headquarters. Each country participating in the Far Eastern Commission sends 50 representatives to cooperate with the Reparations Executive Office established by the Allied Headquarters under the General Staff. It is reported that General Harrison, Director of the Headquarters Reparations Executive Office, will soon organize an executive committee, which will be composed of the chief representatives of the reparations delegations of various countries, and will hold meetings to discuss and propose detailed plans for dismantling and relocation.

He stated briefly: The current food shortage in Jiangsu is not natural but man-made, entirely due to the concentration of large amounts of floating capital into the grain trade, resulting in an unprecedented food shortage. The government has now adopted effective and reasonable methods to strive for rescue. Dean Zhang's three major instructions to the province have been circulated for compliance, so that the abnormal grain prices can be brought into line.

### Grain Riots Continue in Suzhou, More Than 30 Robbers Arrested

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 10th] From 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. this morning, grain robbery riots occurred simultaneously in Jin, Tu, and Pan gates in Suzhou. More than ten grain shops were robbed, resulting in considerable losses. After receiving reports, the military, government, and police agencies immediately dispatched teams to arrest more than 30 grain robbers. At 2 p.m., the City Defense Department invited the county government and the gendarmerie battalion to hold a joint trial. It was determined that the riots were instigated by traitors, and it was decided to strictly interrogate each of the arrested criminals. Those who were instigated will be paraded through the streets and ordered to compensate for the losses, while the masterminds will be executed. In the evening, the City Defense Department and the county government jointly issued a notice to inform the citizens to trust the government and not to be used by criminals. Starting from the 11th, the entire city will deploy self-defense forces to assist the police in guarding and patrolling, and the City Defense Department's garrison troops and gendarmerie will control all key transportation points, all carrying weapons, to strictly prevent grain riots from happening again.

[Another Dispatch] This morning's grain riots affected ten grain shops. Yongfeng Grain Shop on Shangyue Street lost more than ten piculs of rice, Peng Yurong Grain Shop lost thirty-nine piculs of rice and ten piculs of grain, Gonghexin Grain Shop at Jinmenkou, Jicheng Grain Shop, Julongxing Grain Shop in Yaojia Lane, Zhang Fushun Grain Shop on Nanxin Road, Zhenmaoyu Grain Shop outside Panmen, Qian Daheng Grain Shop on West Street, Juyuan Grain Shop at Xinqiao, Hengji Grain Shop, etc., all lost several piculs.

### Hefei Limits Rice Exports to 100 Piculs Per Day

[This Newspaper, Hefei, 10th] Rice prices here have recently fluctuated between 180,000 and 200,000 yuan, and it is difficult to expect them to fall. The direct reason is that rice merchants from various places are snapping up rice at high prices, stimulating the rise. The Anhui Provincial Department of Field and Grain Management recently discussed and decided on two measures to control transportation with relevant agencies: (2) The export of rice from Hefei, except for military grain, shall not exceed 100 piculs per day for the time being; (2) Rice merchants who transport grain exceeding the prescribed amount shall be ordered to sell it on the spot, which shall be handled by the Hefei County Government and the Provincial Capital Police Bureau.

In addition to rice, the prices of all other items have increased by one or two times, and the lives of public officials have been greatly threatened. All the staff of the Anhui Provincial Government signed a petition to Chairman Li yesterday, requesting that each person be allowed to purchase one picul of low-priced rice per month at 60,000 yuan for a period of six months. It is said that Chairman Li has instructed the Department of Field and Grain Management to find a way to handle it. There are currently 5,000 provincial-level civil servants, who need 30,000 piculs of rice in six months. The Department of Field and Grain Management has not yet indicated that it can be handled.

In addition, Nanjing supplies about 2,000 bags per day, and the current flour riots have already passed.

Editorial

### The Issue of Revising the Economic Emergency Measures Plan

According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, the government is currently considering revising the previously promulgated Economic Emergency Measures Plan. The draft is being formulated through discussions among relevant ministries such as economics and finance. This news is credible, as Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan previously stated that he believed the plan was no longer suitable and must be revised.

The so-called Economic Measures Plan covers a wide range of content. Which parts are unsuitable and which parts need to be revised have not been explained by the authorities, so it is inconvenient to speculate. However, upon careful examination, some parts were deemed unsuitable from the beginning, such as the Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during Extraordinary Times, revised and promulgated in the 27th year [of the Republic]. These regulations were entirely based on economic mobilization methods determined during the military period. The provisions regarding which enterprises should be established or abolished, should be government-run or privately-run, and how to support and control them, were very detailed. Although the civil strife has not subsided and the military period has not completely passed, the government clearly has no preparation for the above measures, and no agency has the power or ability to implement them. It is merely an empty document, ordering "strict enforcement," and the result is, of course, just an empty document. This is the first point.

Some are generally good, but certain clauses have clearly lost their timeliness. For example, the various penalty rules stipulate that cases involving values of 50,000 yuan or more should be transferred to the court for processing, while those less than 50,000 yuan should be punished by the competent authority according to law. Considering current prices, cases with values less than 50,000 yuan are probably non-existent. Therefore, all cases of violating price limits, price negotiations, hoarding, and speculation, regardless of size, must be transferred to the judiciary, which clearly does not conform to the original intention of the legislation at the time. This is the second point.

Some have factual preparations that have not yet been fully completed. For example, regarding the quantitative distribution of essential daily necessities for people's livelihoods, according to the law, all employees and public teachers and staff should be allocated goods according to the quota. Currently, public teachers and staff in Nanjing and Shanghai have implemented the plan, but the quantitative distribution for employees is still being compensated with differential pay. Now, due to the difficulty in purchasing rice, various businesses, factories, and employees are eager to be allocated physical goods and cannot rely solely on differential pay. However, the material supply agencies have not clearly stated whether they have fully prepared for these materials or whether they can legally supply them. This is the third point.

Some have objective conditions that are not met, and it is practically impossible to continue implementing them. For example, freezing the cost-of-living index was predicated on stabilizing prices. Now, with prices rising and living conditions difficult, employees everywhere are striving to unfreeze the index. This principle is considered reasonable even by the management and authorities. Therefore, the provision that the January index is the highest level has practically lost its control. This is the fourth point.

Some have restrictions that are too strict, causing industrial and commercial stagnation, and prompt remedies must be sought. For example, the clauses regarding foreign exchange applications and import permits in the matter of developing trade. The import of "certain raw materials and machinery that are necessary for domestic industry" is in principle permitted. However, obtaining import permits and foreign exchange applications is actually very difficult, causing importers and exporters to be in a dilemma, and manufacturers are particularly anxious about the supply of raw materials. This is the fifth point.

Originally, the various plans of the Economic Emergency Measures were unsuitable and had to be revised not only because of the shortcomings in the legislation itself but also because of human factors, namely, the implementation was not satisfactory. To give a few examples, the inappropriate price limits and price negotiations, and the lack of procedures for cracking down on hoarding, have already been pointed out in separate articles in this newspaper. So, to put it simply, the failure of these emergency measures is half congenital, that is, there are too many conflicts in the measures themselves, and half acquired, that is, the promotion has not been effectively carried out. It can also be said that many parts have not been taken seriously at all.

Why have they not been taken seriously! There are various reasons, and the fact that the legislation is too dense and too unreasonable is one of the main reasons. For example, the Regulations on Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation stipulate that almost every move of a merchant must be registered and reported. And all goods, except those that come in one's left hand and immediately go out in one's right hand, are almost always considered hoarding. If the goods are stockpiled and not moved, they must be either purchased or sold by the government at a fixed price, or a location must be designated and forced to be transported and sold. According to these regulations, the so-called adequate inventory and legal profit in the market are hardly applicable in this era.

Therefore, the revision of the current plan must grasp several key points: (1) It must be reasonable, that is, in line with human nature and adapted to the facts. Any rigid provisions that are simply copied, overly subjective, no matter how strict, will ultimately not be effectively promoted. Even if they are forcibly implemented, the result will be nothing more than outward compliance but inner resistance, creating many evils. (2) It must be simple and easy to implement. All unnecessary procedures and useless programs must be eliminated as much as possible, so that businesses and people are happy to comply, and government offices can easily implement them. The people of our country are accustomed to simplicity and enjoy generosity. Moreover, the territory is vast, and customs vary from place to place. It is not advisable to be limited to the experiences of Nanjing and Shanghai, to build a cart behind closed doors, and to rely solely on conjecture, leading to laws and regulations becoming mere formalities and increasing the suffering of businesses and people. (3) It must be decisive. Issues such as unfreezing the cost-of-living index, adjusting the treatment of public teachers and staff, food for the people, import and export issues, etc., are all urgent and must be improved promptly to respond to the situation. If there are delays in deliberation and hesitation, and many extensions are made, it may only lead to more confusion and create more complications. And in the end, we will still have to conform to public opinion, simply damaging the government's prestige. As for all harsh measures and policies that compete with the people for profit, it is hoped that they will be thoroughly eliminated and a new start will be made with the people, in order to work together with one heart and overcome this economic crisis.

### US House Passes Aid Bill for Greece and Turkey; Military Supplies and Relief Goods to Be Shipped to the Middle East

[US Information Service, Washington, 9th] The House of Representatives today passed the $400 million aid bill for Greece and Turkey by a vote of 287 to 107. Of those voting in favor, 127 were Republicans and 160 were Democrats. Of those voting against, 93 were Republicans, 13 were Democrats, and 1 was from a minor party. The bill passed today includes the Vandenberg amendment, which stipulates that the President may withdraw aid under the following circumstances: (1) if requested by the governments of Greece and Turkey, representing the majority of the people; (2) if the President receives official notification from the United Nations stating that the Security Council or the General Assembly feels that the actions or assistance taken by the United Nations make it unnecessary for the United States to continue providing aid; (3) if the President believes that the purpose of the bill has been accomplished by the actions of any other international organization, or discovers that the purpose of the bill cannot be satisfactorily accomplished; (4) if the President discovers that the guarantees attached to Section 3 cannot be fulfilled.

The US amendment stipulated that the definition of those who supported the Moscow resolutions was those who signed the US-Soviet joint communique. Molotov stated in his letter: "In order to carry out the work of the Joint Commission and establish the Korean provisional government, I am prepared to accept the amendments proposed by the US commander."

[United Press, Lake Success, 9th] The spokesperson for the Arab Higher Committee, Katton, presented his views to the UN General Assembly Political Committee on the afternoon of the 9th, demanding an end to the mandate over Palestine and the establishment of an independent state under Arab control. Katton accused Britain of depriving the Arabs of their basic rights, which violated its mandate provisions. He also demanded an immediate halt to Jewish immigration to the Holy Land. Katton continued, "Arabs do not completely rely on the promises and guarantees made to them, because the most important thing is that the land of Palestine belongs to the Arabs." Katton severely criticized the Balfour Declaration, in which Britain guaranteed the establishment of a Jewish state in the region, and called it the fundamental cause of the conflict there. He also demanded that the United Nations recognize that Britain's mandate is incompatible with the UN Charter.

### French Cabinet's Position Strengthened After Reorganization

Communist Party Seems to No Longer Adopt Opposition Actions

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The position of the Ramadier cabinet is more peaceful than before. During the debate on the Madagascar issue, the Communist Party abstained from voting, which seems to indicate that the party is unwilling to take planned opposition actions against the government, and also holds a reserved attitude towards the Overseas Colonies Minister Moutet's point that the Madagascan parliamentarians should be held responsible for the riots. This expression by the Communist Party today can strengthen the government's position. In addition, workers at the Renault car factory have now expressed their acceptance of the government's proposed increase in bonuses, although it is far from their demands.

The purge of Ishibashi, who controls the finances of the Liberal Party, is likely to weaken the Liberal Party's position in the current negotiations between the parties.

[International News Service, Tokyo, 10th] Regarding the allocation of cabinet ministers in the new cabinet, according to reliable sources, the Socialist, Liberal, and Democratic parties will each get five seats, and the National Cooperative Party will get one seat. This point will be finalized at the four-party secretaries-general meeting on the 12th.

Attitudes of the Parties

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Regarding the four-party secretaries-general meeting to be held on the 12th, the attitudes of the parties are as follows: The Toho Party hopes to decide in the meeting who will serve as prime minister.

Secretary-General Ohno of the Liberal Party especially emphasized the fundamental principles of the coalition cabinet and decided to hold an executive meeting again on the morning of the 12th and a general meeting of affiliated parliamentarians in the afternoon to determine the party's official attitude on this issue. On the Democratic Party side, a temporary meeting of affiliated parliamentarians and an executive meeting were convened on the 10th to conduct a comprehensive discussion on the issues of prime minister, policy, and cabinet allocation ratios. As a result, they agreed to assist the Socialist Party on the latter two issues. The National Cooperative Party convened a temporary general meeting of affiliated parliamentarians on the afternoon of the 10th.

### Doctors and Nurses from Health Offices in All Districts of the City Petition to Resign; Director of the Health Bureau Persuades and Reassures Them Separately; Indicates He Will Vigorously Argue with the Mayor on the Issue of Treatment

Recently, due to soaring prices in this city, the lives of salaried people have been greatly threatened. According to news from the City Health Bureau yesterday, the doctors and nurses serving in the health offices in all districts of the city under the bureau, due to meager treatment, with an average monthly income of only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, which is difficult to maintain a living, have all petitioned to resign, and the situation is very serious. According to Director Zhang of the Health Bureau, regarding the resignation of doctors and nurses from various health clinics, in addition to earnestly persuading them to stay, the issue of treatment still needs to be referred to Mayor Wu for resolution. However, at a time when municipal finances are stretched, how to improve is indeed difficult. Currently, the salaries of civil servants are meager, which is a common phenomenon. However, doctors and nurses are technical talents, and the government should give them a little more preferential treatment. I will be responsible for vigorously arguing on their behalf. Director Zhang recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing after attending the 7th annual meeting of the Chinese Medical Association. Regarding his impressions of this trip, he said that at this conference, he was very happy to hear the grand discussions of medical experts in various subjects from China and abroad, such as Fox (ophthalmology expert), Wu Lien-teh (epidemiology expert), and Wu Hsien (biochemistry expert). Director Zhang said that the biggest difficulty in the current health administration work in our country is the issue of funding.

### To Ensure the Security of Various Suburban Counties of Shanghai: A Ten-County Garrison Conference is Held; Commander Xuan Instructs Seven Methods of Suppressing Bandits

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to discuss matters related to the expansion of the garrison command's jurisdiction, the garrison command convened a ten-county garrison conference at the command headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday. The attendees included Xie Chengbing, inspector of the Third Administrative Region, Yu Yueqiu, magistrate of Shanghai County, Liu Jin, magistrate of Qingpu County, Guo Chunyi, magistrate of Chongming County, Wu Wenming, magistrate of Chuansha County, Xi Chengzhi, magistrate of Fengxian County, Xu Zhuyi, magistrate of Jiading County, Cheng Daomin, magistrate of Baoshan County, Li Yuegang, magistrate of Jinshan County (represented by Li Siguang, captain of the security team), Xu Jinyu, magistrate of Songjiang County (represented by Sun Tianji, chief of the military section), and heads of various military sales agencies in the city, as well as the heads of various departments of the garrison command. The meeting was personally chaired by Commander Xuan and lasted until about 6:00 PM.

Based on the reports and reviews of the administrative commissioners and county magistrates at the meeting, the general situation is still good. However, the situation in the three counties of Chuansha, Nanhui, and Fengxian in Pudong is relatively complex, with sporadic bandit activities, but it is not enough to cause concern.

Close discussions were held at the meeting on methods to strengthen contact and consolidate security in the future. It was unanimously decided to thoroughly suppress bandits running rampant in various places in the short term. Commander Xuan immediately gave seven instructions on bandit suppression methods: (1) To ensure local security, it is best to prevent problems before they occur. If bandits have already appeared, the suppression must be thorough. Local military police should cooperate with local armed forces to carry out a comprehensive rural cleanup. (2) Currently, because the urban security forces are strong, bandits with political motives are mostly hiding in remote rural areas. The persons in charge of each county should pay special attention to this point. (3) The armed forces of each county should maintain close contact when suppressing bandits. (4) The suppression of bandits at sea will require the Navy to send warships to assist. (5) If the ammunition supply for the armed forces of each county is insufficient, the garrison command will supplement it as appropriate. (6) After bandits are captured, they will still be punished according to the county's existing punishment methods. (7) If there are any emergencies in each county, the garrison command will definitely dispatch military forces to assist. At 7:00 PM, Commander Xuan hosted a banquet for the attending officials at the Kaige Guishanghai Restaurant on Jiangning Road.

Regarding the current treatment of postal workers, it is definitely not as rumored by the outside world. The current treatment, such as rice subsidies, in-kind differential payments, etc., has definitely not exceeded the scope of government regulations. The cost of living index has also been frozen since January of this year. Recently, prices have been rising, and the lives of postal workers are also on the verge of desperation.

### Appeal of the Metzburg Case Concluded; Dutch and American Diplomats Attended the Hearing; Sentencing Set for the 17th

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Dutch businessman Metzburg illegally operating in the black market for foreign exchange and foreign currency has been sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the District Court. Metzburg and the prosecutor both disagreed and filed an appeal. The case was heard once on the 3rd. Yesterday morning, the verbal debate was opened in the High Court. Dutch Consul General Miterden, Commercial Counselor Stake of the Embassy, American Consul Anderson, Fraile, and legal advisor Zhang Tianyin all attended the hearing. At 9:30 AM, Judge Liu Yugui, along with Judges Han Shuzhi and Wang Kequan, and Prosecutor Luo, took their seats in Criminal Court 1. The hearing lasted for four hours. The court instructed that the case was closed and the sentence would be announced on the morning of the 17th.

Yesterday, the appellant's attorney, Chen Tingrui, first stated that the reasons for the appeal had been submitted to the court yesterday and a copy had been submitted for reference. Metzburg's testimony was the same as before. The 20,000 Hong Kong dollars were a margin for advance exchange, and the 38 gold bars were deposited by the Lianxin Company. The Eberes Company did not engage in banking business and expressed disagreement with the original judgment. Prosecutor Luo's arguments stated that although the defendant claimed that the 20,000 Hong Kong dollars were not a deposit but a guarantee deposit for the Lei'e Company, the manager of that company testified to this. Therefore, it should be determined to be a deposit and should be regarded as a bank according to the Ministry of Finance regulations. The original trial's reference was not inappropriate. The original trial leniently sentenced the defendant because he was a foreigner and did not understand Chinese law, which was inappropriate. It should be requested that the original judgment be revoked and a more appropriate judgment be made. Subsequently, lawyers Chen Tingrui and Cai Runan stood up to defend, citing classics and elaborating in detail. The main points were: (1) The punishment part of the economic emergency measures program has not yet completed legal procedures and cannot be immediately regarded as law. (2) Even if it can be regarded as law before the Legislative Yuan completes the legal procedures, its effective time in Shanghai should be 00:00 on March 5th, while the occurrence of the facts of this case was far before March 3rd. The Garrison Command searched the Eberes Company on the afternoon of March 3rd. (3) The original judgment exhausted its investigatory powers and pointed out that the Eberes Company was a bank, thus wrongly accusing a person, which was a loss of the spirit of the rule of law. (4) The foreign currency confiscated was not the object of buying, selling, or exchanging, and should not be confiscated according to law. Finally, he requested that the errors of the lower court be corrected, the original judgment be revoked, and the appellant be acquitted.

### The King of Real Estate Reveals Embarrassment: Sun Chunsheng's Suspected Treason Case; Firmly Denies Fundraising to Purchase Aircraft

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Sun Chunsheng, the Shanghai real estate tycoon during the enemy and puppet period, being suspected of treason was tried yesterday in the High Court. Sun is forty-seven years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and resides at No. 187 Dunxin Road, engaged in the real estate business. In June of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he served as the executive director and secretary-general of the Shanghai Special City Real Estate Industry Association under the puppet regime and also served as the Chinese manager of the Nichijin Kotsu Real Estate Co., Ltd. In April of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the puppet Nanjing government convened various industry associations in the city at the International Hotel to raise funds to purchase aircraft. The association donated 225,000 puppet yuan. After the victory, he was detained by the Songhu Garrison Command and sent to the High Court for legal action. When Sun was questioned yesterday, he was wearing a blue silk padded robe and often showed a cunning smile. He admitted to the puppet positions charged in the indictment without hesitation. He firmly denied raising funds to purchase aircraft. However, it has been confirmed by the Shanghai Municipal Government Investigation Office that this was indeed the case. Furthermore, it has been verified by the Shanghai Special Commissioner's Office of the Central Bureau of Statistics that the defendant had many interactions with the Japanese invaders through the introduction of his teacher Zhu Boquan, and then served as the Chinese manager of Nichijin Kotsu Real Estate Co., Ltd., and later as the director and secretary-general of the puppet real estate association. At that time, when the Japanese occupied real estate, he used his position to raise huge sums of money from real estate developers throughout the city to purchase aircraft and献铁 (scrap metal). After being sternly questioned by Judge Ding, the defendant revealed considerable embarrassment. The hearing time was quite long. Because further investigation was needed, it was announced that the hearing would be rescheduled, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### The Commercial Alliance and the Industrial Association Held a Symposium Yesterday to Discuss the Implementation of the Economic Reform Plan

The National Commercial Federation and the China Industrial Association held a symposium at the China Federation Guest House on Linsen Middle Road at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the implementation of the economic reform plan and invited relevant parties from all walks of life. Dozens of people attended, including Jin Runxiang, Hu Xiyuan, Xu Yongzuo, Shou Jingwei, Wei Youjie, Sun Xiaocun, Tao Guilin, Yu Huancheng, Zhang Mengzhao, Liu Zhifang, etc. First, Chairman Shou Jingwei delivered an opening speech, analyzing each principle listed in the economic reform plan in detail. He especially emphasized the following three points: (1) The Principle of People's Livelihood is the foundation of nation-building. It is urgent to use the huge labor force to participate in production, and the key to governance is to establish credibility. The authorities should focus on restoring their credibility in the future. (2) Protect industrial profits and formulate an overall plan. Factories dismantled from Japan, except for those needed by the government, should be handed over to various industries. The enemy and puppet industries in the country should also be leased to private operation as soon as possible. (3) Stop borrowing grain and establish Changping warehouses to fundamentally stabilize society. Then, Yu Huancheng gave a speech, stating: In the past, the government focused on the party, government, and military and did not pay attention to agriculture, industry, and commerce, so the government often had a disconnect from the suffering of agriculture, industry, and commerce. Previous resolutions to support industry and commerce have always gone in the opposite direction. It is not known that the party, government, and military are consumers, while industry and commerce are producers, and their position is far more important than the party, government, and military. To cultivate the foundation of the country, the government must change its previous concepts and clarify the basic policies, with supporting industry and commerce as the premise. Economist Sun Xiaocun gave a speech, raising four points of opinion on the economic reform plan: (1) The plan itself lacks a prerequisite principle, (2) The institution itself was not mentioned, (3) The increase in currency issuance should not be relaxed in terms of consumption but tightened in terms of production, (4) Various controls and prohibitions must be relaxed. Zhang Mengzhao, representative of the Shenxin Yarn Factory, reported on the various difficulties of the textile industry, believing that the current price limit set by the authorities is less than half of the actual cost, and if it is not improved, it will be difficult for industry and commerce to maintain. Accountant Xu Yongzuo stated that all government controls, directly and indirectly, are destroying production undertakings. He hoped that the government would implement a more benevolent policy so that the people could have the opportunity to rest. Regarding the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index, he believed that although unfreezing is a reasonable method, the basic salaries of general workers have generally increased by four or five times compared to before the war, and they should also be restored to their original state to be fair. Regarding stabilizing the economy, he believed that the current price increases have in fact exceeded the rate of inflation, so he advocated that the government issue "Price Index Bonds" to ensure the value of the currency, so that the people will no longer hoard, and the government can lend the absorbed floating capital at low interest rates for production undertakings. In addition, Wang Ke, Zhu Jianping, Jin Runxiang, Tao Guilin, Li Renzai, Chen Tiaofu, and others also gave speeches one after another. There was a heated discussion on issues such as unfreezing the index, economic policy, industrial and commercial organization, and training. Finally, it was resolved to immediately organize the Finance and Industry and Commerce Committee and the Vocational Youth Training Class to study issues and train young people, and it was decided that each group of committee members would be limited to fifteen people.

### Contracting for Toilet Paper for Public Toilets Won for 345.67 Million

The price of toilet paper sold in toilets was originally 100 yuan per sheet, but now it has been increased to 200 yuan.

### A Catalogue of Flowers: A Flower Exhibition in a Bamboo Basket at the Hehsing Park, a Riot of Colors Contending for Beauty

[Our Reporter] A flower exhibition opened at Fuhsing Park yesterday at 5 PM. Over fifty flower shops participated, displaying no fewer than two thousand varieties of fresh flowers.

Many of the flower types are exceptionally rare and precious, seldom seen. Such as foxglove, euphorbia tirucalli, pomegranate red, bougainvillea, clivia, azalea, cineraria, calceolaria… and so on. Exotic flowers and strange herbs, a riot of colors; the exhibition clearly took great effort to arrange. Hsü Tien-hsi, the park administration director, was exhausted yesterday, and advisor Cheng Shih-fu developed a high fever due to overwork. Miss Cheng also became hoarse from being so busy. The exhibition is indeed beautiful; flower arrangements, cuttings, potted plants, flower vases… each category has its special appeal. Harmonious colors, aesthetic arrangements, all captivating.

Among the many flowers, the bougainvillea is the most unique, and the color is also the most beautiful, a light rose red, the petals are triangular, growing very closely together. The green leaves are smaller than the petals, so from afar, you only see a pink hue. It is said that this is a kind of azalea, but belongs to a precious category.

The appearance of the foxglove is like an inverted bell, or like a large trumpet in an orchestra. When placed together with the fuchsia, it becomes a world of bells.

The golden iris and the pure white lily, though ordinary, become particularly pleasing when arranged in the same vase, just as a water lily lying next to a hibiscus flower is even more delicate.

The poppy should be wicked, but its bright and dazzling colors far surpass the carnation.

A visit to the flower exhibition can temporarily make you forget the troubles of the world. It is said that the park administration plans to hold two flower exhibitions every year, vine flowers in the first half of the year, and chrysanthemums in the second half of the year. It doesn't cost much money, and it benefits the body and mind, so it is a good adjustment to life.

The park administration also scheduled a flower arrangement competition at Fuhsing Park at 4 PM on the 12th. The administration has prepared more than a hundred flower vases of various sizes and dozens of kinds of fresh flowers for participants to freely choose from, and has invited famous experts to serve as judges. More than twenty female students from St. John's University, Nantong University, Aurora University and women from all walks of life have registered to participate. The list is as follows: Chu Ju-kung (female doctor), Hsieh Tsai-chin (daughter of famous painter Hsieh Hsien-ou), Chu Chih-min (female disciple of famous painter Tao Leng-yue), Ke Yun-yi (daughter of Ke Ching-en), Huang Min-yi, Lin Kuan-hung, Wan Yen-fang, Wang Hsia-hsuan, Huang Miao-ling, Tang Ku-ching (all female students of the St. John's University Agricultural College), Huang Chen-chieh, Tang Chi-hui, Ren Chia-heng, Kao Hui-ching (all female students of Nantong University), Wu Kuo-chen (Aurora University female student).

### A Tangled Web of Impersonation and Assuming Guilt: Iron Shop Owner Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods Shifting Responsibility, Exposed

[Our Reporter] Judge Tsao Tsu-wei of the District Court yesterday heard a public prosecution case of receiving stolen goods. At the beginning of the trial, the plaintiff suddenly pointed out that the defendant appearing in court was an impostor. However, the name of the defendant on the summons matched the name of the defendant on the indictment, creating a confusing and amusing situation.

It turns out that a citizen, Tan Pao-chung, passed by the entrance of an iron shop on Chuchiachui Road earlier this month and saw a pile of scrap iron inside the shop, about 430 catties, which he immediately recognized as the goods stolen from him a few days ago. He immediately reported it to the police, who took the shop owner into custody for questioning. The owner identified himself as Wu Yao-ting, the manager of the iron shop, and said that he purchased the ironware from a peddler on the 24th of last month. The police station transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The prosecutor indicted him for the crime of receiving stolen goods, and Wu Yao-ting was released on bail. Yesterday, the defendant Wu Yao-ting reported and appeared in court, admitting that he was the manager of the iron shop, and also the person who bought the stolen goods, and said: He had responded to the summons of the police station and the District Prosecutor's Office. However, the plaintiff insisted: This was not the person who was interrogated at the police station and the District Prosecutor's Office, and he would definitely not mistake him. The court immediately ordered the bailiff to accompany the plaintiff to Chuchiachui Road to arrest the real "Wu Yao-ting" and bring him to court, and suspended the trial. Soon, the person was arrested. He identified himself as Wu Chen-sheng, a shareholder of the iron shop, and pointed to the defendant in court, saying: "His name is Wu Yao-ting, he is the manager, but my name is filled in on the business license." The plaintiff then pointed to Wu Chen-sheng and said: He was the one who was interrogated at the police station and the District Prosecutor's Office, claiming to be Wu Yao-ting. Judge Tsao believed that these two people, one impersonating another's name and the other taking another's blame, were both suspicious, and transferred them together to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### A Gang of Thieves Steal a Large Amount of Warehouse Paint, Suspects Arrested

[Our Reporter] At around 8 AM on the 4th, Yeh Hsin-fu reported to the Chiangning Police Branch that between 10 PM on the 3rd and 6:30 AM the next morning, the warehouse of Junghua Industrial Raw Materials Company at No. 15, South Yaochiaohang, Yenping Road, was stolen of 27 barrels of paint of considerable value. Chief Chen of the branch instructed section chief Chen Kai-chou to start the investigation. From 10 AM to 12 PM on the 7th, officers Wu Yun-ching, Wang Chi, police chief Ku Yin-hsuan, policemen Chu Szu-hui, Li Hung-chun, and Tan Yang-sheng successively arrested 13 suspects including paint broker Cheng Po-sung, Chang Wei-chin, Hu Yung-ning, Chou Szu-yi, Yang Chia-jui, Tang Yu-chang, Chu Ming-tsai, Pan Han-hsiang, Tang Chi-yi, Chien Ching-shui, Chien Hsiao-kang, and Chien Kuang-hua at various locations including Chiuchiang Road, Mengyuan Hostel on Fukien Road, No. 464 Chuelu Hotel, No. 40, Lane 306, Matang Road, and No. 614 Wukung Hotel, and seized 19 barrels of stolen goods.

### Jardine Matheson Company's Housing Lease Lawsuit:

Second Instance Verdict Favors Kwangsin

In October of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), Jardine Matheson Company, a British firm located at No. 110 Chungcheng East Road, signed a contract to lease the entire three-story building of its newly built "Ta Lu" to Kwangsin Banking Corporation. However, before the decoration was completed and the bank could move in, the Pacific War broke out, and the enemy occupied all of Jardine Matheson's buildings for military use, causing Kwangsin immeasurable losses. After the victory, Jardine Matheson believed that the pre-war lease was no longer valid and refused to allow Kwangsin to move in, leasing the three-story building to Texaco Oil Company instead. Yang Tung-yi, the general manager of Kwangsin, filed a lawsuit in court. The first instance ruled against him. Unwilling to accept this outcome, he appealed to the High Court. Yesterday, the High Court announced its verdict, overturning the original judgment and confirming that Kwangsin Banking Corporation had the right to lease the aforementioned building. It is expected that Jardine Matheson will file a third appeal. If they fail, Texaco will have to find another location to relocate, it is said.

### Where Did a Burning Cotton Ball Come from in Broad Daylight?

[Our Reporter] Chen Kao-tang, 27 years old, from Yencheng, a rickshaw puller, residing at No. 19, Kang Chia-tse, Hsieh Hsu Road, Nanshih, was chopping firewood at the entrance last night around 8:20 PM when his fellow villager Wang Hung-tsai (21 years old, living at No. 31 nearby) was chatting with him.

### Ministry of Education Hosted Capital Reporters Yesterday to Explain the Benefits of the Secondary School Graduation Examination, Presided Over by Director Tsao of the Secondary Education Department

[Our Correspondent in Nanking, May 10th] The Ministry of Education hosted capital reporters at 3 PM today, presided over by Director Tsao of the Secondary Education Department, to explain the benefits of the secondary school graduation examination as follows: (1) The standards of secondary schools across the country vary greatly, and setting a standard examination for core subjects is the most ideal way to gradually bring them closer. (2) Many public and private schools are run conscientiously, but there are also those that are simply filling positions. The Ministry regularly sends inspectors to various regions to supervise, and then uses the examination to allow people in society to understand their strengths and weaknesses, so that young students have a choice. The Ministry provides various rewards and assistance to schools that are run conscientiously, and further urges those that are run less well. (3) The results of the examination can enable those in charge of education to discover the shortcomings of the education policy and seek ways to remedy them. He added: Major decisions in education are not only the opinion of the Minister, nor are they only the opinion of a few people in the Ministry, but are decided after careful consideration by education experts across the country. If the examination system should be abolished, it can be proposed at the National Education Conference to be held in the autumn and discussed and studied with experts. The joint examination method for the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and the presidents of colleges and universities in Shanghai, which combines the examination with the university entrance examination, has been approved by the Minister and ordered to be implemented by the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities and colleges and universities.

### Ministry of Education Orders Joint Holding of High School Graduation Examination and University Entrance Examination

[Our Correspondent in Nanking, May 10th] The Ministry of Education has ordered the implementation of joint holding of high school graduation examinations and university entrance examinations in all provinces and cities, and has recently issued orders to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities and colleges and universities to comply. The methods are as follows: (1) The high school graduation examination for the second semester of the 35th year of the Republic (1946) in all provinces and cities will be jointly held with the new student entrance examination for the first semester of the 36th year of the Republic (1947) in public and private universities (including independent colleges and vocational schools). (2) The examination in all provinces and cities will be organized by the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus and the committees organized by the universities. (3) The committee will be responsible for the matters of question setting, grading, invigilation, examination affairs, and scoring. (4) Before the examination, candidates should fill out the desired study or employment options after graduation, and if they wish to study further, they should indicate the schools and departments they wish to enter in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth places, but only those university departments participating in the examination are allowed. (5) The examination subjects are limited to five subjects: Chinese, foreign language, arithmetic, physics and chemistry (biology), and history and geography. (6) The scope of the questions will follow the curriculum standards issued by the Ministry. (7) Students who wish to study further and whose scores meet the admission standards of the universities will be admitted to the universities according to their wishes. (8) High school general subject graduates who participate in the examination and whose scores meet the admission standards of the universities will pass the high school graduation examination, and those who do not pass the university admission but meet the pass standards of the examination will also be included in the high school graduation results.

The Ministry of Education has sent Director He to Shanghai to handle this matter.

### British University Petition Students Have Withdrawn from Railway Line; Petition Issues Still Under Negotiation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Ying Shih University students, demanding relocation of the university, have obstructed the Shanghai-Hangzhou traffic. The Ministry of Education has successively dispatched Xiang Ju-tan, Zhou Hong-jing, and Hang Li-wu to Hangzhou to persuade them. It is reported that after Hang Li-wu arrived in Hangzhou and persuaded the students, they gradually repented. The students who had advanced to Jianqiao have returned to Hangzhou, and the students at the station have also left. This matter may be resolved smoothly.

Vice Minister Tian's Remarks

Education Vice Minister Tian Pei-lin stated on the 10th regarding the Ying Shih University issue: Ying Shih University students have repeatedly demanded the relocation of the university. Although explanations have been given repeatedly, they still indulge in their old habits, gathering crowds to coerce, and making long-distance petitions, even obstructing traffic and disturbing society. The Ministry is currently striving to rectify the academic atmosphere and will absolutely not allow them to insist on their demands by gathering a crowd, nor will it show any leniency. Currently, Vice Minister Hang and Director Zhou, among others, have successively gone to Hangzhou to enlighten and earnestly hope that these students will promptly repent, return to school to attend classes, and not act rashly, falling into error without realizing it.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, which has been suspended for three days and two nights, is expected to resume traffic tonight.

Chairman Shen's Persuasion

The more than 500 petitioning Ying Shih University students, having accepted Chairman Shen Hong-lie's repeated persuasion, in order to consider the welfare of passengers and avoid being falsely accused of disrupting traffic, have therefore withdrawn from the railway line. This evening, they were transported in batches from Jianqiao back to Hangzhou by vehicles dispatched by the provincial government, and will reside in the Zhejiang University College of Agriculture, to further discuss the overall results with the Ministry of Education. The Railway Bureau has dispatched personnel to repair the tracks that were damaged yesterday and prepare locomotives. Two special trains may be dispatched to Shanghai tonight to alleviate the urgent needs of passengers. A portion of the passengers, having exhausted their travel funds, gathered to petition the Provincial Government Executive Office, which is now raising funds from various businesses to provide them with relief.

Vice Minister Hang's Order

Vice Minister Hang Li-wu arrived in Hangzhou yesterday. This morning, he met with student representatives and spoke for five minutes, conveying Chairman Chiang's hand-delivered order, stating that if the students do not return to Jinhua, they will be disbanded. After Chairman Shen mediated, the students agreed to leave Jianqiao to restore traffic. Regarding the petition issue itself, the two sides' opinions are still difficult to reconcile.

Ying Shih University Students Issue Statement

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 10th] After Vice Minister Hang's meeting, the students of Ying Shih University issued a statement, stating that the disruption of Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway traffic was not caused by them, but by the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Education. The students have now withdrawn from the railway to the Huajia Ancestral Hall College of Agriculture in Hangzhou to negotiate with Vice Minister Hang again. Whether or not traffic will resume on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line after it has been vacated is a matter for the Railway Bureau. According to the students' statement to reporters, the issue of relocation was proposed by former President Yang Gong-da. They are now surprised to see Yang's published remarks and express unanimous anger towards Yang. It is also reported that the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway may be connected by train tomorrow.

Former President of Ying Shih University Discusses Relocation Issue

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The demand for relocation by students of the National Ying Shih University in Jinhua has attracted much attention from various parties. This reporter specifically visited the university's former president, Yang Gong-da, who stated: "Since I was ordered to serve as the president of the university at the end of August last year, I have actively repaired the school buildings in Jinhua, hired professors to handle admissions, and carried out the restoration of the school. On November 20th, classes started as planned. In the past few months, the Ministry has allocated funds to enrich the school's facilities, purchased a large number of books and instruments, and established an independent power supply. Therefore, the equipment is not inferior to that of other schools. The construction of permanent school buildings has also been approved by the Ministry in stages, with instructions to conduct on-site surveys. Unfortunately, I developed asthma and could not be cured for a long time. Due to physical exhaustion, I obtained the Ministry's approval to resign, and the Dean of the College of Engineering, Zhou Shang, was appointed as acting president. I am deeply saddened to hear that the students are requesting relocation and planning to petition in the capital. However, the school's foundation has just been laid, and the planning for the construction of permanent school buildings has just begun. I hope that the students of Ying Shih University will understand the efforts of the school, take care of their studies, and appreciate the Ministry of Education's utmost care, and continue their studies as usual. It would be most fortunate for the school. As for my inability to continue working at the school due to illness, I feel deeply responsible."

### Jiaotong University Students Went on Strike Yesterday and Will Petition in the Capital Within Days; Slogans All Over Campus Accuse Ministry of Discrimination

[Our Dispatch] National Jiaotong University students, angered by the Ministry of Education's decision to abolish the school's navigation and marine engineering departments, and by the Ministry of Education's plan to close the school's science and management colleges and turn it into a purely transportation engineering college, began a strike yesterday to express their protest. Slogans and cartoons were posted everywhere on campus, declaring, "Jiaotong University will not tolerate discrimination, Jiaotong University will not tolerate division." The School Protection Corps, organized by the students, also mimeographed "Express News" to contact classmates and report on the progress of the work. As of yesterday afternoon, more than 1,500 students from 42 classes had signed up to join the School Protection Corps. All students are preparing to petition in the capital within days. The traveling organization will consist of small teams of ten people each, and a medium team of five small teams. Female students will form a separate team. The responsible persons of the corps have already contacted the train, ship, and automobile sectors to address transportation issues. It is reported that a major shipping company has agreed to assist with the shipping part.

[Another Dispatch] The Student Self-Government Association of Jiaotong University has scheduled a reception for reporters from this city at 2:00 PM today (the 11th) at No. 12 Gongchuo Hall of the school in Xujiahui, where they will report on the progress of the strike. According to the person in charge of the association, "Because of the Ministry of Education's discrimination against Jiaotong University, in addition to suspending the two subjects of Navigation and Marine Engineering, it is also intended to force the closure of the two departments of Water Conservancy and Textile Engineering which have already been established. Moreover, according to Minister Zhu, Jiaotong University should absolutely belong to an engineering school, so the College of Science and the College of Management will also be adjusted. As for the fact that the funding is much less than other schools, it is already a fact, so we decided to go on strike from the 9th and will petition in the capital."

President Wu of Jiaotong University Discusses Trip to the Capital for Negotiations

[Central News Agency Dispatch] According to President Wu Bao of Jiaotong University, "This time I went to the capital to ask the Ministry of Education for instructions on handling the two subjects of Marine Engineering and Navigation. The Ministry stated that the two subjects were originally entrusted to this school by the Chongqing Merchant Marine Vocational School. After the post-war recovery, the school has been restored, so it was merged last summer vacation, and the new students were sent to that school. The original senior students of the two subjects will still remain in this school and continue to study until graduation. As for wanting to change the two subjects to departments, it is inconsistent with the academic system. Because Marine Engineering and Navigation are purely technical training, there is no need to run departments in the university, because there is no such precedent in various countries. As for the rumors that Jiaotong University will be renamed, and that the College of Science and the College of Management will be abolished, the Ministry has no such statement."

### Inter-Port Football Match: Shanghai Defeats Hong Kong Two to One; Shanghai Team Comes from Behind, First Half Ends with No Score

[Our Dispatch] The second inter-port football match of this season between Shanghai and Hong Kong teams took place at Yiyuan at 4:30 PM yesterday. After winning the municipal championship, this was Shanghai's first grand inter-port match. Relying on its strong defense and sharp offense, the Shanghai team ultimately defeated the Hong Kong team 2-1, regaining the inter-port cup and avenging the defeat at the Nongjiao Field in Hong Kong. The first half ended with no score. The military and police worked hard to maintain order yesterday, so the situation was good. There were approximately 15,000 spectators, and a total of more than 9,000 tickets were sold. The police band played music at the venue, creating a lively atmosphere. The line-ups of the two teams were as follows:

Shanghai Team

McNitty, Yan Shi-xin, Wu Qi-xiang, Han Long-bo, Tie Fu-ni, Gao Bao-zheng, Li Yao, Sun Jin-shun, Shou De-hua, Han Long-hai, Fu En

Hong Kong Team

Glassick, Xie Jin-hong, Hou Rong-sheng, Feng Kun-sheng, Que Li, Liu Song-sheng, Cao Qiu-ting, Zou Wen-zhi, Xiao Li-er, Sullivan, Xie Jin-he

General Trend of the Battle

The battle was tense throughout, but lacked highlights. The first half ended without a score, and many players were injured. Cao Qiu-ting of the Hong Kong team was the first to injure his ankle and leave the field, followed by Fu En and Han Long-hai of the Shanghai team, which affected the strength of both sides. The Shanghai team's victory yesterday was mainly due to the excellent performance of the defense. Although the Hong Kong forwards were brave, they found it difficult to overcome the three defensive lines. Gao Bao-zheng ran all over the field, and Yan Shi-xin was steady and reliable. The forwards lacked cooperation somewhat, and Fu En was injured, while Old Sun's speed decreased significantly. Yesterday's victory was not easy. The Hong Kong team's defense was not as good as Shanghai's, and although the forwards were strong, they could not break through Shanghai's defense, and ultimately succumbed.

Numerous Injuries

Referee He Chun-hui, linesmen Wu Shou-heng and Chen Ji-xiang, the great battle began at 4:30. The match adopted the British system and could not be adjusted. The Shanghai team kicked off and took the offensive first. Edward advanced quickly in the middle, but was blocked by Que Li. Xiao Hui-er broke through alone, but Yan Shi-xin carelessly missed, and fortunately McNitty rushed out to prevent a major disaster. At 5 minutes, Sullivan collided with Yan Shi-xin while fighting for the ball, injuring his head. He was bandaged and re-entered the field. The Shanghai team's attacks were unsuccessful. At 13 minutes, the Hong Kong team advanced with five forwards, and Sullivan penetrated deep. Fortunately, Yan Shi-xin shoveled out, averting danger. Two minutes later, Cao Qiu-ting and Xie Jin-hong flew together on both wings, and the Shanghai team's goal was in danger. At 19 minutes, Cao Qiu-ting injured his ankle and left the field, and the Hong Kong team played with ten men.

Penalty Kick

At 23 minutes, the Hong Kong goalkeeper took a step while holding the ball and was penalized with a penalty kick. Fu En took the penalty, and Long-hai received the ball and shot, but was too hasty and missed a good opportunity. At 30 minutes, Long-hai also left the field due to an ankle cramp. Both sides were left with ten men. The melee lasted until 35 minutes, when Han Long-hai re-entered the field, while Fu En withdrew due to a recurrence of an old leg injury. The first half ended with a score of 0-0.

Hong Kong Army Breaks Through the City

Changing sides to fight again, the visiting army still appeared with ten men, and the Shanghai team Fu En re-entered the field. In the kick-off, the Hong Kong army advanced quickly. Sullivan and Zou Wen-zhi had a tacit understanding, and Xun Hui-er窜冷路 came out. Wu Qi-xiang failed to block in time, and McNitty's save was slightly delayed, and it actually entered the net, and with a score of 1 to 0, the Hong Kong army reported a victory first. The Shanghai team lost a city, and was not willing to, and the three armies advanced quickly. However, the defense of Hou Rong-sheng and Que Li was tight and there was no gap to take advantage of.

Long-Hai Scores Twice

Until 9 minutes, Sun Iron-Leg dribbled the ball behind and passed it to the left corner from afar. Li Yao lightly lobbed the ball in front of the Hong Kong army gate. General Han descended from the sky and headed the ball. Glassick did not guard against this move and thus gave up the defense with a score of 1 to 1, and the Shanghai team drew the game. After that, the Shanghai team's morale was strong, and the Hong Kong army's hinterland was ravaged. Edward 德羣 Fu En and Han Long-hai and others had many chances to attack the door, and Glassick was extremely busy. Until 18 minutes, Sun Jin-gu and Han Long-hai began to encircle and suppress. Long-hai got a chance in the open space and caught up with a kick and a score of 2 to 1, and the Shanghai team turned defeat into victory again. Fireworks burst out and cheers were thunderous. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Hong Kong army tried its best to counterattack. Sullivan Xiao Hui-er Zou Wen-zhi and others had many wonderful shots, but they were either wild or were caught by McNitty. Both sides were exhausted until the last quarter of an hour before the end of the melee. The statutory time came to an end, and the Shanghai team reversed the defeat with a score of 2 to 1

Both the Green Team and the White Team each had new members participating yesterday.

Wang Shan rushed back from the University Games, and her love of sports is commendable. Liu Zhen-bao, the Green Team's "sharpshooter," scored 34 points alone, which was breathtaking. Although Wang Hui-ling of the White Team fought hard, it was difficult to match her.

The Green Team served the ball, and Huang Ming-yuan took the lead. Liu Zhen-bao's free throws were all successful, and they quickly reached 8 to 0. The White Team changed Zhu Jia-zhen to Guo Ai-zhen, but there was still little improvement. At 12 to 0, they requested a timeout. Wang Hui-ling won a goal, and the first quarter was 14 to 2.

Nie Bao-zhu, the former captain of the White Team, was strongly invited by the team members before the game yesterday and played to help out. In the initial battle of the second quarter, the two sides were deadlocked. Huang Ming-yuan was closely monitored, and the first half was 24 to 9.

In the third quarter, Wang Shan, a strong player from the White Team, rushed to the scene, and her morale was boosted. Wang Hui-ling also worked hard, and the score suddenly increased to 17, while the opponent only added three points. In the competition, this quarter became 37 to 20.

The 500 spectators all cheered for the White Team. The Green Team also invited Cai Bao-qiu from Chongde to participate yesterday. When Huang Wei-zhen "graduated", she stood up and guarded Wang Shan. The two were outstanding in height, like sisters. Zhu Jia-zhen "graduated" at 46 to 26, and Guo Ai-zhen fought again. At 47 to 26, the Green Team won the women's championship.

### Chairman Chiang Concerned About the Food Supply of the Citizens, Telegraphs Order to Protect Legitimate Grain Merchants; Most Rice Shops Reopen Yesterday But Have No Goods for Sale

[This Newspaper's Report] Following multiple rice-grabbing incidents in the city in recent days, many rice merchants closed their doors and suspended business. The Municipal Government recently received a telegram order from Chairman Chiang regarding the food issue, instructing that assistance be provided to legitimate grain merchants in handling the purchase and sale of grain, and that local administrative organs in various places should provide protection and convenience. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government immediately transferred it to the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus and also sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for their information. At the same time, it notified the relevant trade association to inform its members and posted notices in both the northern and southern markets, urging them to operate with peace of mind and not to panic, in order to maintain the food supply for the people. In particular, they were not allowed to hide or destroy rationed rice, and they were also not allowed to raise the market price of white粳 rice and hoard it for speculation.

The Social Affairs Bureau Dumped 18,000 Bags Yesterday

Yesterday, more rice shops opened than the day before, but most rice counters were empty. Transactions in the southern market were suspended, while 3,268 shi of goods arrived in the northern market. Top-quality white粳 rice was quoted at 300,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 275,000 yuan. Top-quality Bo Dao rice was quoted at 295,000 yuan, medium-quality at 290,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 280,000 yuan. Top-quality early rice was quoted at 280,000 yuan, and medium-quality at 275,000 yuan. Top-quality Yang Xian rice was quoted at 290,000 yuan, medium-quality at 280,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 275,000 yuan. Top-quality milled Xian rice was quoted at 270,000 yuan, and medium-quality at 265,000 yuan. Top-quality Bu Xian rice was quoted at 275,000 yuan, medium-quality at 270,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 264,000 yuan. Top-quality Bai Yuan rice was quoted at 305,000 yuan, medium-quality at 295,000 yuan, and lower-quality at 285,000 yuan. Medium-quality Yin Yuan rice was quoted at 295,000 yuan. Because rice merchants refused to accept the rationed 9,000 bags of rice when they petitioned on the 8th, the Social Affairs Bureau carried out a supplementary allocation yesterday, so a total of 18,000 bags were dumped. The price remained at 147,000 yuan.

Good Order in Rice Shops That Opened

A slogan with red characters on a black background, posted by some rice merchants, was found in the southern market yesterday morning. The content was very provocative. Ji Mingqi, the Section Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, took it away after discovering it at the market, in order to avoid trouble. According to Section Chief Ji, he inspected rice shops in various districts yesterday morning. Two-thirds of the 2,240 rice shops in the city had opened, but most had no goods for sale. Those who had rice to supply maintained good order, and there were no signs of panic buying. It is believed that all rice shops in the city will be able to resume business completely by the 12th (Monday).

### Foreign Stocks Slightly Rebound

Foreign stocks rose and fell with Chinese stocks yesterday. They opened higher. Although money exchange businesses and retail investors sold, securities firms actively bought, and northern and Cantonese investors also participated, resulting in demand exceeding supply. Ewo Silk opened high in the morning, reaching 650,000 yuan, then retreated to 625,000 yuan before consolidating and rising to 675,000 yuan before slightly falling back. A telegram from Hong Kong reported that Hong Kong & Shanghai Hotels was still trading at 18 yuan and change.

### Various Industries Actively Subscribing to US Dollar Bonds and Treasury Bills

[This Newspaper's Report] The US Dollar Bond Sales Committee held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the conference room on the third floor of the Central Bank, inviting responsible persons from various industry associations. Many representatives from the hardware, cotton cloth, and other industries attended. Qian Xinzhi, Chairman of the Committee, and Du Yuesheng and Xu Jilou, Vice Chairmen, successively delivered speeches. Secretary-General Xi Lun and Deputy Secretary-General Fan Heyan explained the significance of the treasury bills and bonds, as well as the method of repayment and interest payment.

Other trade associations, such as hardware, drama, securities, rayon, real estate, and iron industries, will subscribe as much as possible after convening a members' meeting to make a decision.

### Yarn Prices Are Difficult to Fall

Yesterday's yarn market saw a tendency for prices to rise rather than fall due to the rumored passage of a resolution at the Nanjing Economic Commission's price conference to unfreeze the workers' cost of living index and issue wages according to the new method, which would increase the cost of yarn factories. However, tight credit in the market seemed to curb the rise slightly, and the acceptance by out-of-town buyers was also sluggish. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn reached a high of 12.4 million yuan, only up 400,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was 6.65 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan. Other yarns, such as 20-count and 16-count, rose by varying amounts, from 100,000 yuan to 300,000-400,000 yuan.

### The Cloth Market Situation is Fluctuating

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened still hovering in a weak position. The asking price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was once as low as 258,000 yuan. Then, the news of the recovery of securities spread, and retail investors rushed to buy, causing the price to rise. The final price was 260,000 yuan, similar to the previous day. Opinion was divided on the Four Gentlemen Golden Seal serge. Ultimately, due to the large number of buyers, the price rose to 260,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, dyed cloth, and Shilin cloth saw a cautious market due to tight credit, with the market showing a fluctuating trend.

The Textile Construction Company supplied more than 30 types of cotton cloth as usual, available for purchase at retail stores and cloth shops, but the number of applicants was not enthusiastic. 12-pound Blue Chicken fine cloth was priced at 234,000 yuan, and second-grade Four Gentlemen yuan serge was priced at 235,000 yuan, with little change from the previous period.

### New Banknotes Shipped from England to Shanghai

### Shanghai Municipal Bank Prepares to Expand Loans for Small-Scale Industries, Increasing the Amount Per Household to One Million Yuan

The Shanghai Municipal Bank previously handled loans for small-scale handicrafts in the city. The first loan was 200 million yuan, which was later increased to 500 million yuan. Now, the Municipal Council has resolved to request the Municipal Government to instruct the bank to expand its operations. It is learned that the bank has been preparing to handle this after receiving the order and has formulated several points for the loan method: (1) The loan amount per household will be increased to 1 million yuan, with a term of six months. Half of the principal and interest must be repaid after three months, and the remainder must be repaid upon maturity. The interest rate is calculated at 0.5% per month. (2) The loan application procedures will also be simplified as much as possible. First, the respective trade associations will prepare a letter to the bank to collect a certain number of application forms, etc., and distribute them to their loan members. After filling them out, they will find a reliable guarantor and use their own industrial equipment as collateral. The association will then be responsible for verifying and sending them to the bank. After review and verification, each loan recipient will be directly notified to collect the funds with their original seal.

### Tea Market Wants to Improve But Lacks Strength

The foreign estate tea market, which has been sluggish for a long time, has still not seen a turnaround. This is because buying interest continues to be sluggish, and sentiment wants to improve but lacks strength. As for various domestic sales teas, supply and demand are balanced, and they remain in a consolidation situation. However, the Anhui baked green tea and pearl jasmine tea from last year, which are needed by the Tianjin Gang, are affected by empty warehouses. Although transactions appear and disappear intermittently, the market is firmer than before, and prices are becoming more stable.

### Seafood Market Situation is Sluggish

Seafood prices have already reached their peak. Recently, affected by tight credit, merchants are trying to sell, so all goods are sluggish. There is a continuous supply of shrimp tails. Except for Jinshan tails, all grades have fallen by about 10%. The arrival and sales of sea cucumbers and shark fins are rare, and the trend is flat and weak. Squid, sea dragonflies, and wood ear mushrooms are weak due to sluggish sales. However, the production areas for shiitake mushrooms have already been cleared, and all grades in stock have been refrigerated in preparation for summer sales, so they remain firm. Other goods are expected to decline further due to weak transactions.

### Paint Manufacturing Industry Faces Many Difficulties, Hoping the Government Will Allocate Raw Materials and Limit the Import of Foreign Goods

The Shanghai Paint Manufacturing Industry Association has 22 members, and there are about a dozen more who have not joined. Among them, the Zhenhua Paint Factory is the largest in scale, with a maximum monthly output of 499 tons of various paints and enamels. The current actual monthly output is only 50 tons, about one-tenth of the maximum output. The maximum monthly output of paint in the city is 2,000 tons, with Zhenhua accounting for about one-quarter. The current actual monthly output is 600 tons, with Zhenhua accounting for about one-twelfth. In addition, the monthly output of spray paint and varnish is about 15 tons each. The current difficulties of the industry and the suggestions to the government are as follows: (1) The industry needs 30 kinds of raw materials, including oils, gums, pigments, and thinners. It is hoped that the government can allocate them at low prices; (2) The industry hopes that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will stipulate paint standards; (3) It is advisable to distribute the paint factories to be established in the future to other cities, and not concentrate them in Shanghai; (4) The industry hopes to send people to participate in the paint factories compensated by Japan; (5) For manufactured products that are already produced in China, please ask the Import and Export Interim Control Commission to limit the import of foreign goods as much as possible; (6) A part of the industry's raw materials must rely on foreign goods. In order to avoid the monopoly of importers, it is proposed to form a joint purchasing office, and it is requested that the government allow them to purchase directly from foreign countries.

The price of local fresh cocoons per market dan is equivalent to the price of 2 shi and 5 dou (斗) of rice. According to reports from various cocoon-producing areas, the price of medium-grade edible rice is 250,000 yuan per market shi, so the price of improved fresh cocoons per market dan is about 1 million yuan, which will be telegraphed to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for announcement.

### Hardware Market Situation

Recently, the various hardware goods have been affected by the crazy rise of gold tickets in the black market, the soaring price of rice, and the possible unfreezing of the cost of living index. All manufactured goods have risen across the board. Foreign nails have fallen instead. Due to the scarcity of foreign sandpaper and the increase in actual lockups, the situation of demand exceeding supply has finally led to an increase.

American goods are the most popular and sell the fastest, with each yard being wholesale for 180,000-190,000 yuan. The rest are dominated by local factory goods.

### Chinese Naval Cadets Training in England

— A Naval Dispatch from Plymouth on April 20th, by Wen

Our country's eastern and Pacific coastlines extend from the Yalu River estuary in Liaoning (53 degrees 50 minutes North latitude) in the northeast to the Beilun River estuary in Guangdong Province (10 degrees North latitude) in the southwest, spanning over 7,750 kilometers. In addition, there are isolated islands in the ocean, such as Hainan Island, Taiwan, and other smaller islands, which are not included. To protect this long coastline, a modern navy is indispensable. Building a new navy, within the overall national defense policy, cannot be achieved with just a piece of paper. In the victorious motherland, despite being in an extremely difficult environment, efforts are still being made in every way. In Gaochang Temple in Shanghai and Qingdao in the north, there are naval soldier schools and naval officer schools, where a group of heroic and aspiring young people are undergoing rigorous training – they are the backbone of the future new Chinese navy. They are diligently studying various subjects, preparing to serve the country and defend the motherland's coastline. Also, a group of outstanding young officers have been selected from this group and sent by the state to allied countries overseas to receive new knowledge and training, preparing to return to China to build a new navy. Here, I would like to introduce the activities of a group of Chinese naval cadets training in the British naval port of Plymouth.

Plymouth is the central base of the British Royal Navy. The winter climate there is such that it snows almost every day. The training location is on a large warship - the Renown, a giant ship with a displacement of 40,000 tons, and one of the largest warships in the British Navy. Speaking of its glorious achievements, it is very respectable; it participated in the First World War. The Renown is one of the three main battleships of the British Royal Navy, built in 1916. The other two ships were sunk by Axis aircraft in this war. This ship is considered lucky, having escaped disaster. In the past, when the British Emperor inspected the Navy, he always sat on this ship as the flagship. After the Pacific incident occurred, former US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill also held meetings on the Renown to discuss strategies, so it is quite famous and well-known throughout the world. The Renown has a displacement of 40,000 tons, which is the registered amount, but it is actually more than this. It has 110,000 horsepower, six 16-inch guns, six anti-aircraft guns, eight secondary guns, and two torpedo tubes. The construction cost reached more than 3 million gold pounds.

On the Renown

All the clothing issued in China was taken back and replaced with British-style uniforms. Each person received a coat, a raincoat, two sets of woolen uniforms, a set of work clothes, three pairs of leather shoes – two black and one white, three pairs of white western-style shorts, two pairs of long trousers, three pairs of woolen socks, five shirts, two large towels, two sets of thermal underwear, a wool sweater, two hats, and some other miscellaneous items. The value of these many items is estimated to be quite large. In the UK, the control of materials is unbelievable; without a coupon issued by the government, you will not be able to buy even a single hair, even if you have tens of thousands of dollars. This is the same for even a small handkerchief, and the prices are high and the quality is poor. You are allowed to eat the food, but not allowed to take it out. No wonder the British diplomats attending the foreign ministers' meeting in the Soviet Union ate so ravenously. Plymouth has been bombed by German aircraft and is still full of rubble, with traces of war visible everywhere. There has been no sign of recovery. The original tram tracks are now all abandoned and replaced by buses, and there is no crowding at all, unlike the traffic congestion in Shanghai. There is a Naffi for military personnel to rest, where everything is available, including food, clothing, supplies, and entertainment. Those who go there are all navy personnel, including navy personnel from various countries, and also female navy personnel. It can be seen how well they treat their military personnel.

As of February 1947, the basic training of the naval cadets training in England has been successfully completed. It is said that some of the cadets could not even recognize ABCD during training, and of course, they were even more confused in class, not understanding what the instructors were talking about at all.

Specialized Studies

Before being assigned to various specialized schools to study their favorite subjects, each of them chose their desired courses, listing their first, second, third, fourth... choices. The scope of their studies can be divided into:

(1) Engine Room Stoke

(2) Communication

1 Visual & Signals

2 Wireless Telegraphy

(3) Seaman

1 Gunery;

a. Qualified ordnance
b. Quarters rating
c. Control rating
d. Anti aircraft
e. Layer rating

2 Asdic submarine detector
3 Torpedo Seaman to rpedo man
4 Rader

a. rade contro Calculation, measurement.
b. rad plotter Drawing

This group of naval cadets sent to England for training will receive specialized training to help us build a new navy. Batches of cadets will be sent to various specialized schools to study. They are in a foreign land, very concerned about the domestic situation after leaving their homeland, and are preparing to set foot on the land of their motherland, so they can work hard to serve the country and defend this ancient country with more than 5,000 years of history and a coastline of more than 7,000 kilometers.

### Eastern Jiangsu Storm

— A Dispatch from Dongtai on May 3rd, by Our Correspondent Ling Songshou

Returning to Dongtai, drinking the heavy and salty boiled water, I felt a nameless sadness in my mouth and heart.

(Top) The "Aurora" (Renown, 7,000 tons displacement), a warship gifted by the United Kingdom to help China build a new navy, has been repainted and will soon set sail for China. (Bottom) The majestic appearance of the "Adventure" (Aruora, 45,000 tons displacement), a huge British ship on which Chinese naval cadets trained in England. (Sent by Wen)

The situation in Dongtai is unstable, and Communist troops often harass the highways. Before setting out, many people advised me not to go. But I finally made the trip with a bit of an adventurous spirit, because this is a place with which I have a not-so-shallow relationship.

I watched Dongtai recover. The troops advanced along the Tongyu Highway, and I followed step by step until I finally reached Dongtai city.

In the drizzling rain, I boarded a small steamer, the water gurgling. I said to myself, "I'll entrust myself to you for now!" The machine gun of the escort team was mounted on the bow, pointing directly ahead, as if facing a formidable enemy.

Narrow Plank and Deep Moat: Like Crossing a Single-Plank Bridge

In a state of irritability and depression, I whiled away the six-hour voyage and arrived in Dongtai. After going ashore and undergoing inspection, I had to pass through a deep and wide trench to enter the city area. A wooden plank was laid over the trench, presumably with the same purpose as the drawbridge in front of the city gate in ancient times, which could be removed at any time. The plank was narrow and the moat was deep, and walking on it was frightening, truly like crossing a single-plank bridge. In addition, there were bunkers all over the streets, especially next to the Red Cross of the hospital and the gold sign of the bank. Having a structure for street fighting made the entire Dongtai shrouded in an atmosphere of tension.

The two days that the reporter was in Dongtai coincided with the news that the town of Caonian, 20 li from the city, had fallen and that the garrison was being rotated. At the same time, rumors spread that the Communist troops had been conscripting ancestral teams in Xiaohai in preparation for attacking the city. A group of well-informed people sent their families out of the city one after another, especially civil servants, truly in a state of panic. "Now I don't even dare to inquire about the news. If I really knew the actual situation, I wouldn't be able to get through the day!"

Ringing the Bell Tower Announces the Start of Martial Law

Objectively speaking, the situation in Dongtai cannot be said to be not serious. In a first-class county with an area of more than 570,000 square kilometers, the only areas currently under government control are the county seat and a highway connecting Tonghai and An and an official river connecting Tai County. County Magistrate Li Xiafu told reporters that he can now control a quarter of the area, which is probably somewhat of a politician's tone. The security in the urban area is of course guaranteed under the governance of the military and political authorities, but martial law is declared after 8 p.m., and earlier when the situation is tense. When martial law begins, it is announced by the sound of the bell on the bell tower. When the reporter heard it for the first time, the sound of the bell, trembling, drilled into my heart. Looking out the window, it was pitch black, and even some lights were dim and pitiful. The Tonghai-An highway can be used for traffic, but very "reluctantly". On the night the reporter arrived in Dongtai, the road surface and power lines between Fuan and Dongtai were destroyed by the Communist troops. As for the official river, this transportation line is relatively safe, but Nanzhuang, 20 or 30 li from the south bank of the official river, is where the Communist troops' Zishi County government is located. At this time when the Communist troops are roaming everywhere, who can say that they will not be threatened?

According to County Magistrate Li, the loss of Caonian was due to a group of bandits passing through the Tonghang Line from Xinghua and reaching the coast. They set a fire when passing through Caonian, and it was announced that it had been recovered the next day, but as of the reporter's departure from Dongtai, traffic between Dongtai and the city had not been quickly restored.

Land of Fish and Rice: Seafood, Cotton, and Salt Are Expensive

Dongtai is a land of fish and rice, traditionally famous for producing seafood, salt, and cotton. Now, because the coastal areas are completely in the hands of the Communist troops, large dried shrimp, two coins per catty, are no longer to be seen. Even if there are other seafood for sale, their prices have exceeded those in Shanghai. The production of cotton and salt is naturally even less to be said. The Caoan Salt Works Office is responsible for managing the coastal salt works from Juegang to Wuyou Road. It was first located in Tai County, and after Dongtai was recovered, it was moved to Dongtai. Up to this point, it can no longer continue to advance and expand the works. I have many old acquaintances in the office. Perhaps because of the rainy weather or the tense situation, when I went in, I only saw everyone chatting to relieve boredom, with nothing to do. Chief Tang said, "The current business is only collecting a little scattered salt tax. The office is not even as good as a tax collection office, let alone a salt works." At this point, the reporter stared at a map of Jiangsu Province hanging on the wall and took a deep breath at the 800-li-long coastal salt reclamation area.

When the reporter first arrived in Dongtai, I saw several boats in the river fully loaded with bags of cottonseed and wheat. I was still congratulating Dongtai on its prosperity, but who knew that these were originally snatched before Dazhongji fell. Dazhongji was originally a distribution center for cotton and a major source of tax revenue for the county government. Dongtai County's administrative expenses are 500 million yuan per month. The total county fiscal revenue in March was 300 million yuan, a difference of 200 million yuan, which was obviously stretched. However, after the fall of Dazhongji in April, the income was less than 100 million yuan. How to make up for such a large fiscal deficit is extremely difficult. According to Zhan Baohuang, the secretary-general of the county party headquarters, in addition to stepping up the implementation of the unified revenue and expenditure method, we can only consider collecting donations and taxes to remedy the situation. This is of course a temporary measure. If the security is stable, the financial problems will slowly return to normal.

A Glimpse of the Salt Works

Within the Controlled Area, We Have Done Everything We Can

Dongtai is now a pilot county in the pacification zone. In an extremely difficult state, we still have to do something to be a model for other places, which is another bitter thing. The reporter stayed for two days, taking a cursory look. The most impressive thing was the blue color on the street. The counters, doors, and light poles of the shops were all painted uniformly and had white slogans written on them. In addition, such as the repair of streets, public health institutions, and cooperatives, "Within the controlled area, everything that can be done has been done." This is what Zhang Naifan, the special commissioner of the Sixth District, told reporters in Zhenjiang. He also had a sentence: "We are thinking of expanding out!" He came to Zhenjiang to attend the provincial government's administrative meeting. As soon as he saw the reporter, he asked, "How is Dongtai?"

During the two days that the reporter was in Dongtai, there was a slanting wind and drizzle, which made me uncomfortable. On the day I left, the sky cleared up. After boarding the ship, the sun jumped out, and golden snakes danced on the water. The sky was clear, and my depressed mood was relieved. The reporter stood on the ship's side, waving to the friends who were seeing me off, and softly called out, "Dongtai, I wish you well in the storm!"

### On Modern French Painting: Pure Painting

— Liu Shi

In the modern French art scene, the rise of many astonishing painting theories leaves one feeling overwhelmed. There are artists like the Cubists with their triangular geometric shapes, the Dadaists with their musical symbol styles, and the Surrealists with their dreamlike and fanciful works, who have created various schools and achieved their illustrious careers. There are also artists like the Neoclassicists and the New Fauvists Mouvean Forvi m (a new painting movement that arose at the same time as Surrealism, but the Surrealist aspect is freer in terms of sensibility and expression), who did not form their own school but only shaped this trend. However, such views are merely the names used for the convenience of critics. In fact, each artist has their own artistic propositions and their own unique expressive personality. Therefore, it is quite difficult to incorporate them into the category of so-called schools or isms. Looking at the current French art scene, it can be said that the only recognized schools are Surrealism and Purism, or even Mechanism.

Many other painters can be said to have their own unique personalities, and under their own unique styles, they arbitrarily express the artistic spirit they believe in. Therefore, it cannot be considered very accurate to divide them into many schools for the convenience of critics' explanations. Moreover, this kind of classification is bound to have considerable differences because the views of critics may not be consistent. Therefore, if one must recognize a school, it is better to do as André Salmon said: "To summarize this group of painters into one category and include them all under the name of the 'School of Paris'." In other words, it can become a comprehensive field of the Paris art scene, encompassing both old artists, core artists, and general emerging young artists.

However, within this so-called School of Paris, there are artists who have lost their vitality and are stagnant, painters who are energetic and崭然露角（嶄然露角 means like, revealing corners that are already there. Hard to translate) , and nameless young people who are full of vigor and devote themselves to hard work. It is impossible to comment on these thousands of artists and their works. Therefore, the first thing we should focus on is what kind of painting issues are being revealed in the modern Paris art scene.

The reason why the modern Paris art scene has such a position is that it was inspired by the strong painting movement of Fauvism in the early 20th century, and then completed through the theories of Cubism, the baptism before the cruel war, and the outbreak of Dadaism. The painting isms or schools that arose in the meantime are too numerous to mention. However, these diverse isms or propositions on painting do not contain the nature of painting as a game, but are surprising efforts to discover the true essence of painting, exploration and investigation. To say it again, the rise and fall of these painting isms can be said to be "experiments" in the pursuit of the truth of painting. Every painting experiment, even if it becomes a finished painting, has brought valuable contributions as a result of many painting experiments and real research.

What is the achievement of painting? We can give the following answer. That is, "Painting must be purely painting." That sounds very ordinary. However, truth is never a strange product, and it often stands out from the ordinary. This is not to say that because it is the truth, it is ordinary, but that only with a sharp eye that wants to discover the truth from the ordinary will the truth shine brightly. Modern painting, after 30 to 40 years of continuous exploration, has finally discovered in the ordinary the truth that "painting has to be purely painting." The so-called painting that is purely painting, in other words, is to say that "painting should be pure painting," and the modern French art scene can be said to be progressing towards this pure painting.

We deduce the stylization of pure painting and study the theory of pure painting, then the expression of this painting lies in the so-called formation of painting.

If all the skills of painting and its expressive spirit can be fully painting-ized and fully purified, it becomes the "formation" of painting. All expressions of pure painting can be said to be obtaining the pictorial effect on the screen. Speaking of grasping the pictorial effect on the screen is about the phenomenon of painting formation. As a method of producing pure pictures, the so-called expression method is valued and studied. Therefore, the expression of so-called pure painting is not only the technique of finishing the picture, but is actually a method of obtaining the pictorial effect of the picture. In other words, it is a painting technique. If it fails to obtain any pictorial effect, it cannot be said to be an expression of pure painting.

When a painter sketches an object, it is not enough to describe the lines of that object and simply express the object as it is. Merely doing so, even if it is an illustration, cannot be regarded as painting. In order to make it possible to regard it as painting, whether it is a simple sketch or a simple depiction, the method of depiction must be absolutely "painterly." Also, if a certain theme is selected, even if that theme is depicted realistically and naturally, merely doing so cannot be regarded as pure painting. If these themes can be detached from the so-called concepts of resembling real objects and resembling nature, and are fully painting-ized and painting-purified, that is enough to become a problem of painting. It is also enough to be an expression made as painting. This is not a simple matter of abstraction. In order to make it fully painting-ized and fully painting-pure, the picture must be anticipated and used as a painterly object. Therefore, the expression of painting is nothing more than the process of painting-izing the theme on this painterly object surface.

The so-called painting-izing the theme on the painterly object surface, that is, the picture, does not simply rely on the basic elements of painting - color and line, but also requires that the theme anticipate the "painterly" reduction; and it must grasp its "painterly" composition. This phenomenon seems close to scientific analysis, but it is not. Instead, it is comprehensive and unified. It can be considered that it is a pictorial surface of painting formation composed of the elements of painting color, line, and composition.

The so-called selection of painterly themes can also be said to be one of the painterly formations. Just as we cut flowers and plants from the mountains and fields when planting potted flowers, the themes selected as painterly themes are obviously things that are cut off from nature. The so-called separating from nature is to transfer the order existing in nature to another different realm, and turn it into a painterly order Ordnung. In other words, the so-called painterly theme is to incorporate the order originally existing in nature into a new order of painting - a category - through the mind of the artist, so that it is purely painting-ized.

Secondly, is to describe the painterly theme on the picture, which goes without saying is a painterly formation. Whether its expression is superior or not depends entirely on the effect of this painting formation. Therefore, the so-called expression on painting is bearing the effect of painting, and what bears this effect and spirit of painting is expression. And only when this expression is finished is the so-called style studied. Therefore, the painting formation itself, without saying expression, and after being painterly tailored, is style. Because of the tailoring of that formation, the various styles on painting are studied.

### Postscript to the Biography of the Stubborn Iron Taoist

— Lao Mei

The Biography of the Stubborn Iron Taoist is Cai Beilun's self-description of his life's aspirations and encounters. Although the Taoist calls himself stubborn iron, I regard the Taoist as true gold and jade that is not thinned by grinding or blackened by immersion; and he has the purity of Boyi, the responsibility of Yiyin, and the harmony of Liu Xiahui, and his aspiration is to learn from Confucius. The Taoist is originally from Fujian. His grandfather served as an official in Taiwan during the late Qing Dynasty. The Taoist was born there, so he also calls himself a Taiwanese. In 1895, the Qing government was defeated and ceded Taiwan to Japan. The Taoist was still young, but he already had the ambition of Zhang Liang avenging Korea. At the age of twenty, he obeyed his parents' orders to study in Tokyo, Japan. After completing his studies, because his mother was still alive, he reluctantly accepted a bride, with the style of Liu Xiahui not being ashamed of serving a bad ruler or being humble about small officials. Later, after his mother died, he felt that the important event had been completed, so he could not bear to live in the place where the tyrannical government originated and where the tyrannical people lived. Therefore, he resigned from his post and bought a boat to return to his motherland, drifting to Shanghai, like Boyi who lived in the North Sea to avoid Zhou, waiting for the time.

When the Taoist first returned to China, he was delighted to see the establishment of the Republic of China and the restoration of the country. He fully intended to use what he had learned to serve the world, to make the people blessed by the benevolence of Yao and Shun, and to take on the responsibility of the world like Yiyin. However, at that time, he witnessed frequent internal troubles and was frustrated. He also painfully remembered that Taiwan was still under Japanese rule. Therefore, he lingered in his ancestral homeland, still living with his fellow villagers, unwilling to leave like Liu Xiahui, hiding in obscurity and living in poverty without complaint or sorrow. Recalling the Taoist's resignation from his Japanese official position and turning his head without looking back is like Confucius leaving Qi and traveling to Zhejiang; the so-called going quickly when one can go quickly.

Recently, when the national crisis first arose and Jiangnan fell to the enemy, the Japanese offered the Taoist a large sum of money to take on an important position. The Taoist repeatedly refused, unwilling to submit. Some criticized him for being stubborn, and others praised him as an iron man. The Taoist then called himself stubborn iron, not worried about being isolated from the world and not diminished by living in poverty; the so-called living where one can live. Fortunately, with the shock of the American atomic bomb and the Soviet Union's declaration of war, the violent Japanese surrendered, and China regained its glory. Taiwan, which had been lost for fifty years, returned to the embrace of the motherland. The Taoist's joy can be imagined! I believe that the Taoist should return to his hometown as soon as possible and participate in the politics of Taiwan. Why is he delaying his departure? Does he still have the feeling of Confucius leaving his parents' homeland?

I remember that when I first met the Taoist in 1917, I was surprised by his extraordinary ambition: he was pleased with his chivalry. When I met the Taoist again in 1928, I wrote a preface for him to record my feelings at that time. This time, after the calamity, we met again, and we both looked old, and our hair had turned gray. Seeing that his distant ambitions still existed and his lofty aspirations had not ceased, I hurriedly asked the reason for his delayed return. He then showed me a memorial text, and I knew that the Taoist had long had the ambition to return, but he was hindered by various circumstances and could not fulfill his wish. He had never forgotten the tombs of his ancestors for a single day.

Recently, the politics of Taiwan have been out of order, and civil unrest has suddenly arisen. Fortunately, the authorities have tried their best to deal with the aftermath, and the turmoil has been quelled. The Taiwanese people are eagerly hoping that the Taoist will return to Taiwan to serve his hometown. The Taoist is also eager to return. I said: This is the time for Confucius to serve when he can serve. The Taoist will use the golden and jade-like principles to develop his talents in Taiwan and express his long-held aspirations! Someone said: The Taoist's stubborn iron has become tempered steel. I don't know if it can be transformed into a flexible finger to cope with the changing situation? That is up to the Taoist to choose how to deal with himself. But I dare to assert that the Taoist will never change his chaste style. I only write this postscript to the biography to leave it to him.

### Reading Zhang Daqian's Recent Works

— Zizai

The early summer weather, due to the prolonged spring chill, still leaves people feeling a lack of warmth in their hearts. Yesterday afternoon, after the rain cleared, I had the opportunity to read some of Zhang Daqian's recent paintings. The pent-up discomfort in my heart seemed to be completely swept away.

Last winter, Daqian spent fifty gold bars to purchase Dong Beiyuan's "Evening Scenery on the Riverbank." The Song Dynasty artist's works are recorded in the "Xuanhe Painting Manual," which lists only seventy-eight paintings by Dong Yuan, and "Evening Scenery on the Riverbank" is one of his masterpieces. Daqian's purchase at the time caused a sensation in the art world, said to have broken the record for the purchase of paintings at a huge price. Daqian spent two months copying it exactly, and his skill is truly supernatural, leaving viewers astonished and unable to tell which is the original and which is the copy. Mi Xiangyang commented on Dong's paintings, saying: "Dong Yuan's style is plain and natural, unmatched in the Tang Dynasty, surpassing Bi Hong, and a divine masterpiece in recent times, with incomparable elegance. The peaks rise and fall, clouds and mist appear and disappear, without contrived artistry, all achieving naturalness; the misty colors are lush, the branches and trunks are strong and upright, full of life; the creek bridges and fishing villages, the isles and sandbanks, all evoke the Jiangnan region." It turns out that Chinese landscape painting, by the time of Beiyuan, approached the natural object, and shares the same goal with Western landscape painting, albeit by different paths. Small trees are often formed by dots, with dripping ink, a technique that Mi Jia derived from this. Daqian deeply understands the secrets of this, hence he considers this work one of his masterpieces.

"Tang Palace Musicians" is carefully designed in terms of color and composition, breaking away from the conventions of previous painters. The painting depicts a corner of the palace, similar to a close-up shot in photography. The depiction of the figures is even more unique. If one is not careful, at first glance, one only sees four or five people, but upon closer inspection, one realizes that there are eight people in the painting. Some only show half a face, some only show a skirt, and some only show a foot. This kind of composition is seen in Western paintings or art photography, but it seems to be a creation in Chinese figure painting. Another special feature is that the left and right sides of the painting are decorated with colorful patterns, which are transplanted from the Dunhuang murals. The brilliant and gorgeous colors further enhance the harmonious beauty of the entire painting. This kind of attempt marks the beginning of a new era in Chinese painting by Daqian, and is worthy of our deep study.

In the thirty-third year of the Republic [1944], the Ministry of Education held an exhibition of Daqian's copies of Dunhuang murals in Chongqing, which caused a sensation throughout the mountain city. After Japan's surrender, Daqian came to Shanghai, and new and old friends alike urged Daqian to move all of his Dunhuang paintings to Shanghai for a public exhibition, to add brilliance to the first international city in East Asia. However, due to transportation issues, it was difficult to transport them all at once. This time, Daqian brought several pieces for art lovers to study. Such as the Cao Yi, the military commissioner of the Guiyi Army in the 26th cave of Mogao Grottoes during the Five Dynasties, the portrait of Lady Jin, the Princess Guiguo Tian, ​​and the offering of Li Xi of Longxi, the portrait of a laywoman from the 151st cave of the High Tang Dynasty, the image of a nun in the same cave, the Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta from the 19th cave of the Yulin Grottoes, the story of Prince Sattva sacrificing himself to feed a tiger from the 245th cave of the Northern Wei Dynasty. Although there are only these six pieces, they represent a transformation, and the rest can be inferred from them. Tang Dynasty paintings are not easily seen today, let alone paintings from the Northern Wei Dynasty! Therefore, from this Northern Wei Dynasty painting of a tiger feeding, we can know the actual situation of the painting style at that time. The laywoman image of the High Tang Dynasty (see picture), is seven feet six inches high and four feet three inches wide. In the 47th year of the Republic of China (1918), on April 7th, the Taoist Wang Yuanlu discovered a hidden scripture chamber in this cave. A few years ago, when Daqian was traveling in Dunhuang, the Taoist told him about the discovery, which was a historical coincidence. The bag hanging on the branch in the painting is very similar to the popular new style of women's handbags, and the cane held by the person in the picture is the same as the commonly used cane today. The style of the hair curls remains fresh after a long time, which is very interesting to see. In addition, the copying and production of these murals are done by an all-around painter. His use of brushstrokes, ink, and color application naturally have his special skills, which goes without saying.

Daqian returned to Chengdu for more than three weeks this time, and after returning to Shanghai, he gave us many new works to appreciate, which is an infinite feast for our eyes. After seeing it once, I wrote down what I gained, so that we know that in a country where prices are soaring and wars are not over, there is another corner that is still a society of truth, beauty, and goodness.

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 505

— Ye Jingfeng

No one answered outside the door, only a mysterious knocking continued, two taps, with an interval; six taps in total, still knocking so softly.

"Who?" He Jian heard no one responding outside, and this way of knocking was mysterious and contained a teasing meaning, as if a familiar friend was joking with him. However, in such a big city like Shanghai, He Jian knew that he didn't have such a familiar friend, so he felt strange and a little annoyed, so he raised his voice and asked, "Who?"

Tap tap, ... tap tap... tap tap... tap tap... This time, it tapped eight times in total.

The sound of knocking on the door increased by two each time. It was as if the person outside hadn't heard He Jian ask, "Who?" But as soon as He Jian asked, the knocking immediately started. If the visitor had heard, they should have answered at least once, right? Since they didn't answer, and kept knocking like this, what was going on?

At the same time, from the sound of knocking increasing by two each time, it can be inferred that if He Jian inside didn't change his approach and kept asking, then the knocking outside would inevitably increase by two each time. If it wasn't teasing, what was it? At least, in He Jian's frustrated mood, it was somewhat teasing to be bothered like this for no reason.

"Who is it?" He Jian was obviously getting stubborn.

The answer from outside the door was ten taps; with a pause every two taps; indicating that if the person inside didn't open the door, the tapping sound would continue to increase.

"When one is down on their luck, even ghosts mock you!" He Jian said, perhaps with this thought in mind. But after this tenth tap, He Jian suddenly realized that the visitor must be Shouyi. Xiang Zhengyan was his subordinate and wouldn't dare to joke like this; Li Ming had been serious and restrained ever since they met and wouldn't do this; as for that Korean youth representative, he was as shy as a maiden in her chamber and wouldn't do this kind of thing even more.

As for Shouyi, that was hard to say, because when he and He Jian met for the first time, they only talked a few words, and they became as close and familiar as old friends, and he had joked with him face to face. Only Shouyi, Zhengyan, Li Ming, and a few other people had come before and naturally didn't need to announce themselves. He Jian was sure that this person must be Shouyi. Thinking further, since Shouyi was playing around with He Jian in this anxious situation, it must be because he had good news; perhaps the comrades of Bain Ren Manor were playing the role of chivalrous people, deliberately appearing and disappearing mysteriously, showing this trick when none of the three parties expected it, and easily rescued Pingzi from the bandit's den and sent him to He Jian's place, giving him a big surprise.

These fantasies flashed through He Jian's mind like sparks from flint. This was also the reason for his unreasonable speculation, but a kind of wishful thinking. At that time, He Jian smiled dumbly, stopped asking, and strode to the door, pulling it wide open.

"Excuse me, are you Mr. Zhu Luo Mi?" The voice was so sweet and crisp, and full of resonance, as if it had been trained in vocal music for many years, speaking in a pure and authentic Beijing accent.

### Shame of Spiritual Food

— Lei Ke

It was reported that a riot recently occurred in Chengdu, where thousands of poor people robbed rice merchants of rice, and all rice shops, candy shops, etc. on all streets closed their doors and suspended business, as if there was a strike. The only business that remained open as usual was the bookstore. Friends who saw this news believed that the bookstore industry (that is, the publishing industry) was worthy of pride. But upon closer reflection, it felt sad and ashamed. The poor do not rob bookstores, not because they have special respect for culture, but because they do not feel an urgent need for this spiritual food. They simply do not care about the existence of our spiritual food.

In cultural circles, when it comes to spiritual food, it seems to be more important than everything else, as if there is really something that can be eaten, and one will feel hungry if one doesn't eat it. Moreover, there are even more serious people who are extremely picky about these spiritual foods, wanting to distinguish which are beneficial and which are poisonous, fearing that they will harm those who eat it. Little do they know that only rice and wheat are regarded by the common people as the foundation of life, and as for the spiritual stuff, they only regard it as waste paper favored by a few literati and scholars, and in their eyes, it is only worth a few cents a pound for wrapping salt, sugar, or peanuts, and has no other value.

This is not because the common people are cold and ruthless, but because most of the people who create spiritual food are building carts behind closed doors and have not considered the needs of the public. They only create a very delicate snack, which only a few intellectuals have an appetite for. Furthermore, even the word "delicate" is questionable. Most of them are nominally delicate, but in reality, they are substandard substitutes that are not worth chewing, or inferior goods with luxurious decorations. Taking a step back, even if we now create truly exquisite and delicate snacks, or even popular food for the masses, the masses simply cannot eat these things, so how can they regard them as food? In short, there is still a literacy gap between spiritual food and the masses. Before the bridge is built, no matter how well the spiritual food is advertised, they are still unattainable and cannot be purchased or consumed.

Some people call this bridge a literacy movement. However, simply being literate may not be enough to cross it. The words learned in three to five months using the crash course method can be completely forgotten in the same amount of time. Only by paving the bridge of literacy with spiritual food can the masses be able and eager to cross the bridge. This task is easier said than done. If culture and education do not work closely together, this matter will be difficult to achieve.

"Having just visited Lady Yu's to pay respects to one's godmother, now one is paying respects to Godfather Liang, the new Minister of the Household, a lively entrance, a desolate courtyard in the main hall; if the father has intentions, he should pity the concubine, how can the servant have no face for the sake of her husband, a hundred and eight prayer beads express deep affection, a few gusts of wind carry the fragrance of milk."

This is a poem mocking Hanlin Wang during the Qianlong period, Wang was unethical and flattering. His wife first worshipped the concubine of the Jin Tan Xiangguo Yu as her mother, and then Xiangguo lost power, so she went to Tangquan to worship Liang Jieping Shangshu as her adoptive father. The behavior was very intimate. In the cold winter months, Liang went to court early. Wang's wife would always take the court beads first, warm them on her chest, and personally hang them up for him. When Lei first arrived, he presented coral beads from his bosom with both hands to Liang on the day of his yellow greeting. Liang blushed greatly and ran away. Wang's wife chased the beads to the place of concern and circled them around his neck. The guests were full, all were greatly surprised. The next day, someone wrote this poem on Wang's door. An old novel named "The Puppet's Record" describes this matter.

Wang's relationship with others was so strong that he did not hesitate to flatter others at the risk of his life. It was something that even maids and prostitutes would disdain to do, which was truly shameless. Looking at his worshiping of a godmother and then a godfather, being opportunistic, ungrateful, then his flesh is not worth eating. However, the coldness and warmth of human relationships are the same in ancient and modern times. Furthermore, those puppet figures disregard shame, do not know morality, use profit as a union, and use gold for friendship. When the profit is gone, the gold is exhausted, and they are like strangers, who will care for each other? I heard that when the traitors put on their clothes and hats and became monkeys, adopted sons surrounded the pavilion and peaches and plums filled the door, rushing to the front of the steps, taking a close look as the greatest honor. Now that these traitors are shackled and chained, they have been imprisoned one after another. The door is deserted, and everyone has fled, and no one is left to care for their families.

Chanting the two lines "The thread comes from Yu's house to worship the godmother, now worshiping Godfather Liang," and sighing that the puppet's mantle is passed down in one continuous line, it seems that it is not surprising.

### The Japanese Are Laughing

— Xiao Yin

The Tianjin and Beijing reporters who went to visit Tanggu New Port were blocked by our allies with bayonets and suffered a not-so-small insult.

So, the Japanese on a ship flying the "Sun Flag" laughed loudly. Looking at the reporters' statement afterwards, I seemed to hear the enemies' cackling, owl-like laughter, and I seemed to see the hideous ghost face hidden behind the smile.

Originally, our country, one of the "Four Powers" or "Five Powers," has been insulted more than once, so there is no need to be surprised; it seems that it can be ignored that people from defeated countries sneer at us. In fact, haven't they already created a bigger Nonggu incident for us to see?

However, I thought of what was said in a certain newsletter: Most Japanese firmly believe that failure is temporary and that they will rise again soon; I thought even more of their farewell message of "We'll be back in twenty years." Their ambition to invade has not been completely eliminated, and we should not "laugh it off" at their laughter.

Listen, the Japanese are laughing!

I can't help but ask: Will they laugh even harder when they see that we are still in a state of chaos and turmoil everywhere?

### A Scene of "Returning Home in Glory"

There is no problem with unfreezing the cost of living index, but we hope that when the cost of living index is unfrozen, prices will not continue to rise. Otherwise, to whom will civil servants, workers, etc. appeal?

The chaotic traffic situation in Shanghai is rare in any country. Dr. Conway, an American traffic expert, also shook his head when he came to Shanghai. In fact, there are only two points to rectify traffic: (1) scientific management (2) increase traffic routes (aerial or underground). For the first point, if you visit the cars in Hongkou, you can know the achievements of our management; for the second point, the construction of new lanes requires a lot of money, and the city government is so poor, how can it start construction?

Originally, not many Chinese people read newspapers, but now newsprint prices are soaring. The evening paper has already risen to 1,000 yuan per copy. It is said that the daily newspaper will rise to 1,500 yuan per copy from the 16th. Then, there are probably not many people who can afford 40,000 to 50,000 yuan a month to read a newspaper. Under the high pressure of prices, the future of the Chinese press will also be bleak.

The production cost of a film is at least tens of millions of yuan. Various film companies are trying their best to improve the quality of films and no longer produce them crudely. It is hoped that the government will restrict the distribution and stop the screening of crudely made films.

Minister Yu said that the total number of legal tender issued is only more than 6 trillion yuan. This is the first time the Ministry of Finance has publicly announced the amount of legal tender.

### Freezing and Thawing

— Tang Shan

In natural phenomena, freezing and thawing are based on a law of physical necessity. Taking ordinary water as an example, when the temperature reaches zero degrees Celsius, it will definitely condense into a solid, and when it reaches above zero degrees, the water will return to a liquid state. If no artificial action is added in the middle, freezing and thawing will develop along with the natural temperature.

Natural phenomena are scientific and definite. Have you ever seen water not freeze at the freezing point? Or have you ever seen a frozen riverbed in the scorching heat of June? Therefore, in terms of social phenomena, when white rice rises to the 300,000 mark, the cost of living index for workers is still frozen at the stage when white rice was 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per stone three months ago. How can this be reasonable? How can our social order be stabilized?

Recently, it is said that the cost of living index is about to be unfrozen, which is inevitable and should be. However, to unfreeze it, we must also create a dissolving temperature. We know that scientists must start by changing the temperature of the substance to solidify or dissolve it, so that it naturally changes. The freezing and thawing itself completely depends on the environment in which it is carried out. Failure to understand this physics will result in an explosion.

The development of human civilization originated in the temperate zone, because that kind of warm climate is most suitable for people's work. Of course, there are also animals and plants in the Arctic Circle, but that region still does not have a high level of human culture. If life is frozen in an ice cellar, society will not progress. This kind of natural experience is what the gentlemen who stabilize our society should remember. We can only adjust the temperature of society so that thawing and freezing become extremely natural states, so that people can have a truly peaceful life.

Summer has begun, and not only must the freezing of the earth inevitably require thawing, but we also hope to usher in a prosperous day. Only in that vibrant season can the problem of freezing and thawing be truly resolved.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

More than thirty people got on the bus very stably. They also knew that there were too many people taking the bus and did not want to seek comfort. Everyone tried their best to squeeze in, and the luggage only occupied half a car; only Lan and Feifei were persuaded by Zhang Changlu and those people in front to sit on the driver's seat.

"Miss Zhou, Miss Zhu, we'll switch with you later!" Lan still felt very sorry and repeatedly said to the two actresses that everyone should take turns sitting.

"Don't worry, you may not be able to sit stably!" Lao Zhu said with a smile. He knew very well how noble the driver's seat of a truck was in people's minds.

Lan smiled faintly, and she obviously didn't care about this.

Feifei was too excited, climbing on the front of the car for a while, then climbing down again, then playing with the steering wheel used by the driver; Zhang Chang accompanied her like an older brother, playing up and down, front and back, as happy as students going out for a trip during the spring break.

Those who didn't get on the bus yesterday gradually came to look for them. The quiet wilderness immediately became noisy, like a day of rushing construction.

The five military trucks were quickly filled with people. At nearly eight o'clock, a large group of people wearing khaki uniforms arrived, and the noise became even more chaotic. Those drivers simply opened their mouths to curse and started fighting, and all the people on the bus without tickets were driven away; but after a while, another group of "scalpers" who didn't have tickets but had obtained their tacit permission came in succession, and the number was even larger than the former. Everyone on the bus was worried about how to endure the long journey of two days and nights on such an uneasy truck. (6/7)
