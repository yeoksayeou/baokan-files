### Fierce Fighting Around Siping; National Army Calmly Launches Counterattack; Anshan-Shenyang and Jilin-Changchun Lines Also Heavily Attacked

[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 13th] The moment for the great battle of Siping has arrived. Starting from the 11th, the Communist army launched successive fierce attacks, which intensified last night, using dense artillery fire to bombard the airfield.

### China-Mongolia Border Issue; Sino-Soviet Treaty Stipulates That the Existing Border Shall Prevail; Mongolian Army's Invasion of Beitashan Is Indeed a Deep Incursion into Our Territory

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] Since the Xinjiang incident occurred, all parties have attached great importance to the China-Mongolia border issue. This reporter visited Fu Jiaoling, Director of the Department of Territory of the Ministry of Interior, on the morning of the 13th to inquire about his views on the border issue. He said that, according to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the border between China and Mongolia "shall be the existing border." The border survey work has not yet begun because diplomatic relations have not been established between the two countries. However, the "existing border" referred to in the treaty should be the one shown in the "Map of the Administrative Regions of Mongolia" published by the Ministry of Interior in 1940, which is more detailed and reliable. The Mongolian army has now penetrated Beitashan, 600 li deep into the territory of Xinjiang Province, which is indeed an invasion of our territory and cannot be compared to a border dispute. Outer Mongolia is divided into fifteen aimags (equivalent to our provinces) and one special municipality, with an area of 1,553,500 square kilometers and a population of approximately 800,000.

The railway bureau stated that traffic may be restored on the 14th.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] The 3 li section between Liushouying and Zhangjiazhuang on the Jinyu section that was previously demolished has been repaired by 8:30 AM on the 13th. Two sections of the railway between Jinxihe and Chadian were blown up on the morning of the 13th and were also repaired by 8:30 AM. Traffic on the Jinyu section has been restored.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 13th] The Communist army, with two columns and five brigades, launched a full-scale offensive between Jinghai and Cangxian on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway yesterday. Fighting continued on the 13th. Over 30,000 Communist troops from the nine regiments of the Fourth Column under Nie Rongzhen, the three regiments under Qiu Hongyin, and the three regiments under Liu Bingyan began attacking Dahaozhuang, Zao Po, Xiaoyuan, Dazidian, and Fenghuadian east of Cangxian at 5:00 PM on the 12th.

The selection of members for each branch office will still be handled according to the personnel distribution of the General Election Office, with each party taking responsibility. Finally, Hong expressed his disapproval of the proportional representation system proposed by various parties, because there is no such provision in the election regulations, which is not in line with the spirit of democracy.

### Conflict in Sera Monastery in Tibet Has Ended

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The recent political change in Tibet, the killing of Reting, and the resulting disputes between border ethnic groups have subsided, and this chaotic situation has been resolved. However, according to people from the Panchen Lama's office in Beijing, although this kind of incident has become a thing of the past, it may still occur repeatedly, which is very worrying. This reporter then visited the person in charge of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to inquire about the course of events, and he said that the Tibetan government arrested the Regent Reting Hutuktu and imprisoned him in mid-April, and also sent troops to besiege Sera Monastery. After hearing the news, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission telegraphed the Tibetan authorities, saying that Sera Monastery is a sacred place of Buddhism and should not be destroyed, and should be resolved peacefully, and that details should be reported. The Tibetan government replied on April 29, saying that the former Regent Reting attempted to harm the current Regent Taktra Hutuktu, so Reting and the related Che Da Huan people were arrested and detained. The ignorant monks of Sera Monastery echoed Reting and resisted the government, and the Tibetan monks, laypeople, and people's congress unanimously agreed to punish them. There was no destruction of temples, and all students and Han merchants in Tibet were properly protected. Recently, it was heard that Reting has died of illness in prison, and the military conflict in Sera Monastery has ended, and local order has been restored.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] Regarding the Tibetan incident, this reporter visited relevant people, and they said that the government is urgently taking the following measures to deal with it: (1) Quickly send high-ranking officials to Tibet to comfort the people, (2) Develop work in the Tibetan areas near the border, (3) Promote various constructions in Tibet, (4) Strengthen the construction of Qinghai and Kang provinces. They believe that if the above points are ignored, the Tibetan affairs will still be precarious, and the relationship between the pro-British faction and the pro-Chinese faction will continue to evolve.

### United Nations Agency Personnel Pay Attention to the Xinjiang Incident; Concerned About Whether China Will File a Complaint

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 12th] United Nations personnel are paying close attention to the report from the international press in Nanjing that China may file a complaint with the United Nations regarding the invasion of Xinjiang by Mongolian troops, but there has been no official comment. Unofficial personnel immediately speculated that if China does take this action, will it veto Outer Mongolia's application to join the United Nations in its capacity as a permanent member of the Security Council, as the Security Council is about to review Outer Mongolia's application, and the joint committee of the Security Council and the General Assembly is currently discussing the procedures for United Nations membership. The Security Council Affairs Department of the United Nations Secretariat refused to comment on the report, but the international press report has made people here more concerned about the situation in Xinjiang, especially given another report stating that uranium mines were discovered in Qihe, northern Xinjiang, several months ago. If this news is true, it will directly involve the International Atomic Energy Commission, which is larger than the international control of atomic energy plans.

### Launching the Xinjiang Incident Aims to Probe the United States, the World Telegram Comments

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The Scripps-Howard World Telegram recently published a comment on the Xinjiang incident, claiming that the invasion of Xinjiang is to test the reaction of other major powers (including the United States) to this kind of situation. The newspaper stated that today's world must make a "choice of doctrine," one is the Truman Doctrine, and the other is the Hitler and Mussolini Doctrine, the latter of which "only leads to world chaos and disaster." The newspaper commented that large-scale wars do not come like a bolt from the blue, but their causes gradually brew.

### Northern Travelogue, Part Two - The Sofa That Lost Its Elasticity

— Bu Shaofu

Beijing is a sofa, a sofa that has lost its elasticity. It still gives people a feeling of comfort, but lying on it for a long time always feels a bit off, its internal springs have loosened. After twelve years of absence, this time I deeply felt this taste from it.

Why is it a sofa?

If you don't have the opportunity to overlook Beijing from a low-altitude plane, you can climb Jingshan and look around, and you will know that this city is not only the most beautiful city in China. Mayor He Siyuan said: Four words—"righteous and bright"—can describe Beijing, the front gate facing the back gate, the east gate facing the west gate, straight, the entire city square and upright, the houses and streets wide, each family has a courtyard—a courtyard house, full of sunshine. Mr. Li Songshen, a technician from the Municipal Works Bureau, also praised Beijing as the most excellent grid-shaped city in the world, which meets the requirements of the latest urban planning, namely (1) urbanization of urban gardens, (2) creative architecture, (3) residences near shops. This is a good place to live and rest!

Drink tea at Beihai Yilantang, Laijinyuxuan or Shanglinchun in Zhongshan Park; stroll along Chang'an Street and Wangfujing Street; browse the old book stalls and antique shops in Dong'an Market and Liulichang; Taiping flowers, peony flowers, peony flowers, lotus flowers, and chrysanthemums, each season has its own flowers to enjoy; casserole stewed pork at Shaguo Ju, hot pot at Xilaishun, Peking roast duck at Quanjude, there is no end to eating. And the people are so sincere and simple, and the air is so quiet and refreshing.

Why has it lost its elasticity?

In a word, the scenery remains the same, but everything else is different. Poverty has made this city lose its vitality, become depressed and paralyzed. Beijing has a population of more than 1.6 million, and 80 percent of them are unemployed or unproductive. In that 20 percent, three-quarters are salaried employees. Under the economic situation where prices are soaring today, we can easily imagine the living conditions of the citizens of this city. There is a saying in Beijing, "Three hangings," meaning that there is no house to live in, nothing to do, and rice is too expensive, each of which can drive people to hang themselves. In the few days that I stayed in Beijing, there were suicide news in the newspapers almost every day. The northern people are honest and simple, and they commit suicide when they can't live on. Although this docile way is pitiful and sad, can we ignore the serious impact presented by this silent accusation?

The tram company is suffering heavy losses, with a revenue shortfall of more than 300 million yuan last month. The company authorities plan to raise prices, but in view of the sharp decline in passengers after the last price increase, they are afraid to think about raising prices again. Because of the sharp decline in passengers, the result is a decrease in income. The same is true for rickshaws and pedicabs. From the east city to the west city, the highest fee does not exceed 3,000 yuan. The drivers have to grit their teeth and let the car price and commodity prices be as unrelated as a horse and an ox. They know that pulling a few less coins is better than no one caring. All these phenomena illustrate the poverty of the general public, and they are trying to reduce their living standards to the lowest possible level. One day, if they can't even eat corn cakes and cornmeal, accidents will be inevitable. A friend said, "Anti-hunger" slogans should be raised by the drivers in Beijing.

Originally, Beijing has no industry, or it can be said that it has no commerce. It is entirely a city of consumption.

If we were to force it, from 1926 to 1937, handicrafts had a glorious history and occupied a considerable number in foreign trade. It includes eight kinds of handicrafts such as carpets, lace, embroidery, and copper and tinware. But now, there are fewer people who have this kind of leisure and energy, and transportation has suffocated its vitality. The stalls at Dongdan Archway and the antique market at Tianqiao have many things that are so cheap that they are out of proportion to general prices. Even so, there are still few visitors in front of the door. After all, buying these leisurely and elegant things is not as necessary as buying a few bags of flour.

Without industry, commerce becomes one-sided and only supplies consumption, and because of geographical relations, it is not a transfer port. A person in charge of a financial institution told me that his business income is not enough to maintain the monthly recurring expenses of this unit. He also said that Beijing merchants are very trustworthy and very stable. They never take risks, and bankruptcies are rare. For example, doing a mortgage, in Shanghai, a merchant with 50 million goods can adopt the method of serial mortgage to make a market of hoarding 150 million US dollars of goods, Beijing merchants clearly know this method, but they will never do so.

Poverty has eroded purchasing power, reduced living standards, and forced everyone to struggle on the hunger line. Women wearing colorful veils are still speeding through Dongdan and Xidan in groups, the sound of camel bells outside Xizhimen is still so leisurely, and the red walls, yellow tiles, and green trees are still shining with color in the sun; ... The content of people's lives has changed significantly.

The sofa is still a sofa, but it lacks elasticity, and that comfort is very limited.

### Bai Chongxi Postpones Flight to Xinjiang; Executive Yuan Review Meeting Listens to Report on Xinjiang Incident; Soviet Mongolia Has Not Yet Replied to Our Protest

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The date of Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi's trip to Xinjiang. As of the 13th, it has not yet been decided, and it is expected to take place on the 14th or later. It is reported that Bai Chongxi was originally scheduled to fly to Xinjiang on the 12th, but later received a telegram from Zhang Zhizhong saying that the matter could be resolved locally, so he postponed the trip. He has now telegraphed Zhang Zhizhong again to discuss it, so the departure date should be after receiving Zhang's reply. Due to Bai Chongxi's postponement, there was talk in the capital on the 13th of reassigning Deputy Chief of Staff Liu Fei, which is difficult to believe, as the central government attaches great importance to this matter and does not change its view because it is a border incident. People here generally believe that the government is determined to ensure the border. When the Executive Yuan held a review meeting on the morning of the 13th, Bai Chongxi and Wang Shijie both gave reports. The political committee members exchanged views on the new situation, but made no decisions. According to relevant sources, the truth about the Beitashan incident is gradually becoming clear. Ethnic issues seem to be the crux of the matter, and loopholes in the part of the Sino-Soviet Treaty related to the Outer Mongolian border are the main cause of the outbreak. Xinjiang people in Beijing will express their opinions on this matter, possibly in the form of a letter to the people of Xinjiang, stating two points: one is the attitude towards the Outer Mongolian army's invasion of Xinjiang, and the other is to support the central government's endorsement of Mesut as the head of Xinjiang, and to call for new unity to consolidate our border territories.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] After the Xinjiang incident occurred, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs simultaneously protested to both the Soviet and Mongolian sides, but as of the 13th, no reply had been received. Furthermore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to announce anything about sending personnel to Xinjiang.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] This reporter recently interviewed Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Political Participation Council, regarding the Xinjiang incident and asked him to express his thoughts. Shao said that this was a border conflict incident and would not escalate as seriously as rumored. Zhang Zhizhong has handled the situation in Xinjiang very well, and will continue to maintain a moderate attitude, so there should be no problems. Shao believes that this incident is expected to be resolved in the short term.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Tianshan Society telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the 13th regarding the Outer Mongolian army's invasion of Xinjiang, and also sent a telegram to the whole country, requesting the government to take reasonable measures. The telegram was passed by the society's temporary board of directors meeting on the 13th. Xinjiang legislators Hua Shengmu·Maolu and others are all directors of the society, and most of the members are Xinjiang natives. The telegram proposed four measures for the government to adopt: (1) Strengthen the armed forces to defend the territory; (2) Adopt strong diplomacy to stop the aggression; (3) Based on the Ili Peace Treaty, declare the troops in the Ili, Tacheng, and Altay areas and dispatch national troops to take over the border defenses of these three regions; (4) If necessary, file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council. Furthermore, the National Women's Organizations Friendship Association held a meeting on the morning of the 13th to discuss the Xinjiang issue and decided to (1) mobilize women across the country to unanimously oppose the invasion; (2) contact all sectors of society to support the government; (3) launch an anti-aggression movement in the capital, hold another meeting on the morning of the 14th, and issue a declaration.

[Our Newspaper] An important member of the Democratic League said: Someone who served as an administrative official in Xinjiang for ten years said after returning that Xinjiang will become Outer Mongolia's second, which is deeply worrying. The current Xinjiang incident is not expected to escalate, and the government should resolve the problem through diplomacy and improve the internal situation in the province.

[Our Newspaper] According to the 49th issue of the Tongji University Express yesterday: "The spokesperson of the Shanghai Student Federation is quite concerned about the Outer Mongolian invasion of Xinjiang and will issue opinions on the current situation on the following points today: (1) Request the government to promptly announce the actual situation of the Outer Mongolian invasion; (2) Publicly disclose the situation of negotiations with Outer Mongolia at any time; (3) Lodge a serious protest with Outer Mongolia."

### The Lüda Inspection Team Returns to Shenyang; Inspection Results to Be Reported to the Central Government Immediately; Soviet Union Still Refuses National Army Entry into Lüda

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 13th] The Lüda Inspection Team, led by Dong Yanping, took a special train from Huludao northward on the morning of the 12th, passed through Jinzhou at noon, and returned to Shenyang at 6:00 p.m. The team arrived in Lüda on the 3rd and left on the 12th, staying in the Soviet military guesthouse for ten days. Except for the 7th and 10th, when two groups went to Dalian for inspection and returned on the same day, the rest of the time was spent in Lushun. The inspection was divided into three groups: social, port, and China Changchun Railway. The Soviet army was responsible for reception and protection. There was little actual inspection, and most of the reports were made orally by Chi Zixiang in his capacity as the local person in charge (Chi is the Chairman of the Kwantung Administrative Office). There was only one instance where the people surrounded them in the market for a brief chat, so the team regretted not being able to have close contact with the people. According to a team member, the market in Lüda is orderly, and the food shortage has improved. The Soviet military commander in the area is General Beloborodov.

Furthermore, the results of the inspection of Lüda will be reported to the central government in the coming days by Dong Yanping, who will fly to Beijing.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet government has refused to allow government troops to enter Dalian and Lushun, and the Soviet government is deliberately delaying China's takeover of Lüda.

It is claimed that in October 1945, two months after Japan's surrender, the Chinese government notified the Soviet Union that Chinese officials would travel by sea to Lüda with troops. Given the circumstances at the time, the only way to travel was by sea, but the Soviet Union refused to allow travel by sea without giving any reason, and suggested that they travel by land. The Soviet Union was also well aware at the time that a land route was impossible. Subsequently, the Chinese government received reliable intelligence that there were anti-government armed forces in the vicinity of Lüda.

On March 7 of this year, the Soviet Union notified China that it was ready to transfer the administration of Lüda, and the Chinese government replied on March 31, detailing the reasons for China's postponement of the takeover and clarifying the Chinese government's new plan, which of course included the issue of sending troops. The dispatch of troops was necessary to protect the safety of administrative personnel, as it was known that Lüda was surrounded by the Communist army, and the Chinese government did not want to see a repeat of the Harbin incident. After several back-and-forths, the Soviet Union has so far resolutely opposed the entry of national troops into Lüda, making it impossible for China to restore its administrative power over the area.

### Accelerating the Strengthening of National Defense Is Our Urgent Task; Wei Lihuang's Remarks Upon Arriving in Berlin

He cited France as an example, saying: France needs to start from scratch, but France's performance in equipping and training armed forces is excellent. England and the United States are also implementing universal military training, and even Belgium is strengthening its military training and national defense work. He also told reporters: After returning to China, he will report to the government in detail on what he has learned from this trip and will make some suggestions on strengthening and modernizing national defense. Wei also said: It seems that none of the countries he visited intended to hide any secrets. He believes that the reason why these countries allowed him to see everything was perhaps because they knew that even if they gave us the blueprints and samples, we would still be unable to manufacture such secret designs of weapons. Wei's party originally planned to visit countries in the Middle East, but has now decided to return home via the United States after visiting Germany.

### Report by the American Tea Association: Tea Prices Will Rise, but Chinese Exports Will Hardly Return to Their Former Glory

[Central News Agency, New York, 13th] According to a report by the American Tea Association: Retail tea prices may rise due to costs and global shortages, but tea is still the most economical beverage. The report reviewed the global post-war situation and the domestic tea market in the United States, stating: There is currently no possibility of increasing global tea production, so prices will also rise to reflect increased costs. Unless Ceylon, India, the Dutch East Indies, China, and Japan restore pre-war production levels, there is no possibility of tea prices falling. Retail tea prices in the United States will also rise in the future. Although tea is not subject to international control, in a few years, global tea production will fall short of demand, as the tea gardens in all major tea-producing countries have suffered significant damage during the war. Although the prospects for Indian, Ceylonese, and Japanese tea are good, Chinese tea has declined by 70% since the War of Resistance against Japan due to political instability and economic chaos. In addition, Chinese tea growers use outdated methods in cultivation, processing, and marketing, and the tea estates in Taiwan's main "Oolong tea" production area have prices that are even higher than those on the international market. Therefore, the prospects for Chinese tea to restore its pre-war export volumes are even more bleak.

### Director of the United Nations Shanghai Office, Yan Renjie, Leaves Shanghai for India; Holds Press Conference Before Departure to Report on the Establishment of the Office

[Our Newspaper] Yan Renjie, a Czech national and director of the United Nations Shanghai Office, came to Shanghai from the United States with Deputy Director Zhu Shixian on April 25 to prepare for the establishment of the office. At the same time, he also prepared for the convening of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Now that the office has been established and the conference is scheduled to open on the 16th, Yan's mission in Shanghai has come to an end. He left Shanghai by plane yesterday afternoon to New Delhi to prepare for the establishment of an office in India, and then travel to Cairo, Paris, London, and other places before returning to New York to report to headquarters.

Before leaving Shanghai, Yan held a press conference at 10:00 a.m. yesterday with Lu Senbao, acting secretary of the Economic Commission, and Zhu Baoxian to report on the process of establishing the office, the preparations for the economic conference, and his departure from Shanghai. He highly praised the enthusiastic support of the Chinese government authorities and people from all walks of life. He explained that the Shanghai Office will provide various United Nations organizations with news and reference materials. In the future, China can receive news dispatches of up to 10,000 words from Success Lake every day to supply the local press.

### Preparations for the Far East Economic Conference

Yan then introduced Lu Senbao, who reported on the preparations for the economic conference. Lu briefly said: The list of representatives from the ten countries participating in the first meeting (China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Siam, India, and Australia) is not yet complete and will be announced at the opening of the conference. He said: The Soviet delegation, consisting of eleven people, will be the second largest delegation (the largest being China) and is on its way to China and will soon arrive in Shanghai by plane. He indicated that the permanent location of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has not yet been decided, and the first meeting held in Shanghai will be of a consultative nature. English and French will be the working languages of the conference.

During the conference, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East will set up a press office in Room 927 of the Cathay Hotel to facilitate news reporters to go and gather information. There will also be a guest seating area in the venue. Those who wish to attend the hearing can obtain an admission ticket from Mr. Wang, the person in charge, but they need to obtain the ticket twice, once for the morning session and once for the afternoon session.

Finally, Yan Renjie briefly described his personal impressions of sightseeing in Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places during his visit, expressing his hope that the efforts of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East will be beneficial to China's ultimate economic construction.

Commentary

### Suggestions for Lifting Foreign Exchange Controls and Rescuing the Current Economic Crisis

Since this spring, the fluctuations in commodity prices have intensified, and the intervals between these fluctuations have shortened. This phenomenon precisely illustrates that the economic crisis has become increasingly profound, almost on the verge of collapse. The situation is so urgent that we cannot afford to deliberate leisurely or go in the wrong direction and then try to remedy the situation. We should immediately come up with concrete measures and put them into action immediately. Therefore, regarding the current economic crisis, we advocate a quick rescue. Recalling the initial implementation of the import licensing system last winter, the original intention was to regulate foreign exchange and eliminate the threat of dumping. The main purpose of the emergency economic measures this spring, which prohibited the buying and selling of gold and banknotes and their circulation, was also to eradicate or at least reduce the disruptive factors of economic turmoil. However, the results of implementation were contrary to expectations. Economic turmoil continued as before and even intensified. Import restrictions slightly curbed dumping, but smuggling flourished instead, and the import of raw materials was genuinely restricted. The impact was that industrial production not only did not improve but also stagnated due to a lack of raw materials. Post-war materials were originally scarce. Without imports to regulate supply and demand, the scarcity would naturally increase, further fueling rising commodity prices. Foreign exchange allocation was nominally tightened, but the black market for foreign exchange never disappeared. Adjusting surpluses and deficits to meet supply and demand is a very natural economic phenomenon. Now, instead of guiding or supporting it, we rely solely on administrative pressure. How can this be effective? Remittances from overseas Chinese have fled, exports have been hindered, and there is no source of foreign exchange. How can the government supply it? The economic stalemate has created political distress. As a result, there is much debate, and remedies are applied haphazardly, further increasing the turmoil.

Some say that the current economic crisis is caused by the civil war, and unless the civil war stops, there is no way to resolve the economic crisis. We cannot completely deny this view. However, to mix economics and politics together and attribute all of today's economic stalemate to politics is also open to discussion. From our economic perspective, if appropriate policies are implemented thoroughly, there is still a way to deal with China's current economy. Once the economic stalemate is broken, political distress can at least be partially alleviated. Of course, we are not saying that once the economic problem is solved, all problems will be easily resolved. However, we believe that even before all problems are solved, addressing the economy in terms of the economy is not entirely without solutions.

The severity of the current economic crisis is generally considered to stem from fiscal imbalances. We also relatively agree with this view. However, fiscal policy and the economy are closely linked, and the economy is the source of fiscal policy. If we focus solely on fiscal policy and ignore the economy, it is like abandoning the root and pursuing the branch. Fiscal revenue and expenditure should be balanced, which is a matter of course. However, to focus solely on balance without regard to the economy is like draining the pond to catch all the fish! In this regard, we can say that unless there is a solution for the economy, there is no way out for fiscal policy. We can also say that the priority today is the economy, followed by politics.

Everyone knows that the current economic crisis in China lies in the general lack of materials, stagnant production, and halted imports. Our misguided fiscal and economic policies have further exacerbated the situation. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost. We do not want to dwell on theories. Here, we simply write out a few suggestions. We believe that the current economic crisis has reached a point where it must be rescued, and we hope that our suggestions can attract attention.

(1) Foreign exchange transactions should restore freedom. The current method of settling foreign exchange from exports should be abolished immediately. This would free exports from the constraints of foreign exchange settlement regulations, allowing exporters to freely sell their foreign exchange earnings in the market. This would break the stagnation of exports, and the strange phenomenon of smuggling would no longer be seen. However, to prevent capital flight through exports, exports should not require foreign exchange settlement but should still be subject to registration procedures. This would prove that all foreign exchange earned from exports is used to import materials or sold to importers. The central bank should also no longer force importers to provide the required foreign exchange. Importers should be allowed to purchase it from the market. This would eliminate the current cumbersome foreign exchange application procedures and the losses due to time delays. With free transactions, both importers and exporters would feel convenient. With export foreign exchange to supply imports, the import of essential goods can be restarted.

(2) Trade still needs appropriate controls. After the opening of foreign exchange, trade still needs appropriate controls. Otherwise, the abuses of last year's laissez-faire approach will be repeated. Imported goods should be strictly classified, and licensing measures should continue to be adopted before import. The import of luxury goods and non-essential goods should still be restricted or prohibited, while the import of essential goods should be relaxed as much as possible. In this way, all foreign exchange earned from exports can be concentrated on the import of essential goods. This would not only increase the supply of raw materials for domestic industries, alleviate the general panic over the lack of materials, and avoid the re-dumping of foreign goods, affecting domestic national industries. With this natural trend in foreign exchange, the international balance of payments will naturally become closer to equilibrium, which will help stabilize the exchange rate.

(3) The exchange rate should no longer be rigidly pegged. The natural level of the current legal tender's external value is still difficult to accurately determine, and it is not advisable to suddenly make a rigid peg. How can we maintain a rigid exchange rate peg without sufficient foreign exchange reserves? It is better to simply open it up. After opening up, the exchange rate should be allowed to adjust automatically according to changes in trade balance and commodity prices. In this way, income from exports and overseas remittances will not be affected by the peg and will gradually increase, which will also help stabilize the exchange rate. However, the central bank must still adopt intervention policies in legitimate transactions in the foreign exchange market to balance supply and demand and avoid unnecessary seasonal or special fluctuations. However, this type of intervention does not require the establishment of a separate agency for public activities and can still be carried out by the central bank in secret through adjustments. Furthermore, unreasonable exchange rates should not be forcibly maintained but should be helped to find their natural level. Unnecessary fluctuations at the natural level should be prevented. If the exchange rate rises sharply after reaching the natural level, the central bank can supply foreign exchange in secret. Conversely, if it falls sharply, the central bank should immediately purchase it. Slight fluctuations at the natural level can be allowed to occur naturally without intervention. In this way, the central bank can use a small amount of foreign exchange to balance supply and demand and maintain longer-term stability.

(4) Foreign capital flows should be facilitated. After the opening of foreign exchange, capital flight must be prevented, but the repatriation of foreign capital and the remittance of profits must be facilitated. The economic recovery and construction in the future will depend on the inflow of foreign capital, which should be facilitated. While giving foreign capital freedom of movement will increase pressure on the exchange rate, we believe that foreign capital inflows will far exceed outflows at this time when foreign businesses are rebuilding in China, so there is no need to worry too much about this point. However, to prevent cunning individuals from seeking opportunities to escape capital, foreign capital must also go through licensing procedures before remittance.

Trade controls and foreign exchange controls, such double controls have caused trade to be blocked and production to be halted. Trade needs to be controlled. This is a necessary measure for countries that are lagging behind in industrialization. Having trade controls, why have a foreign exchange application and settlement system? The government's current reason for pegging the foreign exchange rate and not allowing free foreign exchange settlement is to avoid rising exchange rates, which would stimulate domestic price increases. However, the current reality is that although the official foreign exchange rate is pegged, the black market exchange rate still fluctuates, which hinders trade and exacerbates price fluctuations. Therefore, this reason is no longer valid. As for the opening of foreign exchange that we advocate, if implemented, it can achieve the following effects: (1) The problem of export prices will be solved, the quantity of exports can be increased, and import trade can also be restarted. (2) Foreign exchange does not have to go through the black market, and materials can be imported or sold to importers to import materials. (3) Funds that have already fled abroad can be given the opportunity to flow back in by purchasing materials for import. (4) A portion of foreign capital can be attracted to make up for the gap in the balance of international payments. Compared to the two, the government no longer needs to worry. For the sake of the present, we ask the government to quickly open the foreign exchange market to rescue the current economic crisis.

### British and American Negotiations Begin in Washington D.C. - US Aid Plan for Europe Becomes Concrete - Clayton to Visit Europe for On-Site Investigation

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] It is reported that the British Embassy has begun negotiations with the State Department to study the implementation of Secretary of State Marshall's call for European unity in order to assist. Diplomatic sources said that before urging its government to launch a European unity plan, the British Embassy should first ask the State Department to clarify several points in Secretary Marshall's plan. The United States hopes that the United Kingdom will be the first to respond to Secretary Marshall's call.

[Reuters, New York, 13th] The New York Times Washington reports that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have ordered Deputy Secretary of State Clayton to prepare to go to London and other European capitals to study the possibility of the United States assisting Europe based on Secretary Marshall's recent speech at Harvard University. Clayton's trip is not to suggest a US aid plan for Europe but to listen to the opinions of European countries on how to unite and help themselves. However, Clayton may make suggestions so that European countries know how the United States hopes they will cooperate in order for the United States to consider granting large loans. According to Secretary Marshall's speech at Harvard University, he called on European countries to unite in order to achieve economic self-rescue and warned them that if European countries could not agree on a common plan, the United States would not be able to contribute much more to alleviate Europe's plight. The mission of the United States is to draft a European plan and engage in friendly assistance. The United States should do its best to assist in the restoration of a sound economic system in the world in order to achieve political stability and ensure peace.

[Associated Press, London, 12th] US officials hope that the United Kingdom will take the lead in convening a European economic conference before midsummer. The purpose of this conference is to propose Europe's needs based on Secretary of State Marshall's construction of the United States' assistance in the revival of European countries. The United States does not want the Soviet Union or its satellite countries to participate in this meeting, but it welcomes the participation of the Soviet Union and other countries if they are willing. American economists who are keen on the European situation believe that the United States' participation in the pan-European recovery plan will last for four years. It is estimated that the United States will have to pay a price of US$6 billion in the first year, and it will be reduced in subsequent years.

### Secretary Marshall Urges Europe to Take Initiative

[Reuters, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall today reiterated his call to European countries to unite to restore Europe's economy. Secretary Marshall said: "We support the establishment of a European economic system on which the future politics of Europe depends, but this must be initiated by Europe. Before I delivered the Harvard University speech, I did not receive any instructions or suggestions from Europe to support the aid to Europe plan." Secretary Marshall also stated that the Europe he mentioned in his Harvard University speech included the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. In other words, all parts west of Asia are included. According to Secretary Marshall's speech at Harvard last week, he asked European countries to unite to formulate their economic rescue plan. He also said that this matter should be initiated by Europe, and the United States should do its best to assist in the economic recovery of Europe.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference on the 11th that if European countries can automatically determine a comprehensive plan for recovery, the United States is prepared to provide part of the US$5-6 billion required to assist Europe in restoring economic autonomy. Marshall also said that when he referred to the European recovery, he was referring to the current borders of Europe, that is, west of Asia, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the Allied countries. However, the Secretary of State did not specify whether the United States would provide financial assistance to the Soviet Union or its satellite countries.

### Marshall Advocates, Bevin Praises

[This newspaper] London, 13th broadcast: Bevin praised Marshall's aid to Europe proposal at a foreign journalists' conference today. It is said that the plan is a bridge connecting the East and the West, and no thought or other reason should prevent this great effort. The US proposal includes the Soviet Union, so some misunderstandings can be removed. Bevin continued that Marshall's Harvard speech can be listed as one of the greatest speeches in the world. At the same time, the British government stated that the British side will convene a conference of European countries to formulate a complete plan.

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] The British Liberal Party passed a resolution at the National Conference this morning welcoming the plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall for the United States to provide economic assistance to various European countries. They said that Marshall's contribution is a major cooperation in rescuing and revitalizing Europe and called on the British government to seize the great opportunity of this plan, and should also use the European Economic Commission of the United Nations to promote the economic integrity and recovery of the entire Europe.

### Mission to Canada Completed, Truman Returns to Washington D.C.

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 13th] US President Truman has left here by car this morning after visiting Canada, taking the route of Toronto and Niagara Falls to return to his country. Canadian Prime Minister King accompanied the President to the special car.

[Associated Press, Ottawa, 12th] President Truman ended his goodwill visit to Canada today and made a statement to the press, saying that the United States hopes to be friendly with every country in the world. Some reporters believe that this is a compromise move towards the Soviet Union. The President also asked the reporters to use the word "every". Afterwards, Canadian Prime Minister King made a reply, echoing the President's views.

### Atomic Energy Control - US and Soviet Differences

[Associated Press, New York, 13th] After eleven months of debate on the issue of atomic energy control, the current opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union on the six major points are as follows: (1) Both the United States and the Soviet Union agree to ban the use of atomic energy for aggression. (2) The United States agrees to international groups monitoring atomic energy minerals and factories, and the Soviet Union agrees within certain limits. (3) The United States agrees to punish those who illegally manufacture atomic energy, and the Soviet Union also agrees, but only allows the Security Council to enforce it. (4) The United States agrees to establish an atomic development authority to manage research and register atomic energy, and the Soviet Union opposes it. (5) Ban the manufacture of atomic bombs and destroy existing ones. The sudden country agrees, but it must be after the establishment of the management plan, and the Soviet Union agrees, but it must be before the establishment of the control. (6) The United States opposes the veto power of the five powers. The Soviet Union believes that there should be no veto power in daily management, but when voting on punishing violators, the five powers should have veto power.

### Greek Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns Home

[This newspaper] London, 13th broadcast: A Greek government spokesperson said that the Greek Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Politis, has left the Soviet Union and returned home for a two-month vacation.

### Cohen Urges Law-Abiding Countries to Uphold the UN Charter - Should Not Stand Idly By in the Event of Open Aggression

[Agence France-Presse, Long Beach, California, 12th] Cohen, advisor to the US State Department, said in his address at the annual meeting of the Long Beach Chamber of Commerce that all law-abiding countries should have the right to protect the UN Charter and have this moral obligation. In the event of open aggression, no country has the right to stand idly by and take no action, and no country has the right to force its own concepts and lifestyles on other countries by force or threat. The United States should use all its strength and influence to assist all countries, regardless of whether they are large or small, to live in accordance with the UN Charter. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary for the United States to provide financial assistance to Europe. In the next three or four years, the revival of Europe will require 600 billion yuan each year. Unless Europe can obtain this financial assistance, turmoil and unrest will be difficult to avoid. The goals of the United States should be (1) to increase European coal production and facilitate its transportation system; (2) to supply European countries with fertilizers and agricultural implements to develop European food production, but if European countries do not abide by the UN Charter, the US economic assistance will be difficult to restore Europe.

### US Navy Asks Congress to Allocate Funds to Build Pacific Defenses - Plans to Make Guam a Strong Base

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Secretary of State Marshall told the press today that the Korean provisional government is expected to be established in a short period of time in accordance with the Moscow Agreement of December 19, 1945.

### Japanese Merchants Get an Inch and Want a Mile - Demand Opening of Foreign Exchange

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] When Japanese traders first heard that the United States had decided to allow the resumption of civilian trade on August 15, they briefly showed normal and pleasant expressions. In the past one or two days, they have often deliberately made many pessimistic remarks and at the same time put forward excessive demands. They are not only impatient with MacArthur's headquarters controlling the permission of all imports and exports, but they are also trying to further open up foreign exchange. However, according to reporters, the following points may be possible for Japan's foreign trade after the reopening: (1) Actual transactions can only begin on September 1, and it is said that foreign merchants will get equal opportunities. (2) Civilian exports will be temporarily suspended due to pre-war foreign contractual relationships. (3) The foreign exchange rate will not be specified for the time being. (4) Japanese merchants will still pay in yen, and foreign merchants can use US dollars or other permitted foreign currencies. Trade must first be approved by MacArthur's headquarters and then executed through the Trade Agency.

### Soviet News Criticizes Japanese Foreign Policy

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 12th] News today severely criticized the foreign policy of Japanese Foreign Minister Ashida Hitoshi.

The current entire Japanese policy violates the Potsdam Agreement on the democratization of Japan, and Ashida's statement is an inevitable result of the policies adopted by the Allied occupation authorities in Japan.

[Reuters, London, 12th] Minister of Defense Alexander told the Imperial Press Conference that Britain's security policy in the Middle East remains unchanged, and Britain's legitimate defense needs in the region will continue to be guaranteed.

### Minor Uproar with French Tram and Bus Companies; Service Suspended Briefly and Then Resumed; Caused by Insult to Union Representatives; Main Protagonist of Zhang Jinhai Tragedy Becomes Target of Public Anger

[Report from this Newspaper] French tram and red bus services were suspended at 1:30 PM yesterday due to an insult to union representatives by Mr. Kuo Shih-yuan, a senior official of the French Water and Electricity Company's Transportation Department, as a protest and to demand the dismissal of Mr. Kuo. The workers' emotions were very agitated. After the incident, Song, the Director of the Songshan Police Station, personally led police officers to Lujiawan to maintain order. The Municipal Social Bureau and the General Labor Union were informed and sent personnel to mediate. At 5:50 PM, the workers accepted the persuasion and resumed work first, and tram and bus services on all routes resumed.

The case originated when Yang Dao-sheng, a ticket seller on the French Route 24 trolleybus No. 268, was joking with No. 54, a ticket writer stationed at the Foch Road-Seymour Road station (a staff member, not a worker), during downtime on the 9th of this month because there were very few passengers on the trolleybus due to the storm in the city. Unexpectedly, this led to animosity, and No. 54 submitted a report to the company that day, stating that No. 268 had committed derelictions such as "ringing the bell before closing the door." Based on this report, the company fined No. 268 one day's salary. The next day, No. 268 negotiated with No. 54, and a conflict occurred. The company then dismissed No. 268. Upon learning of this, the union sent more than ten representatives, including No. 188, to the company's Transportation Department at 10:00 AM yesterday to inquire about the reasons for the dismissal of No. 268. Mr. Kuo Shih-yuan, a senior official of the department, stated that the company's dismissal of No. 268 was not open to negotiation. After the union representatives directly negotiated with the general manager, the company authorities agreed to retain No. 268 and withdraw the dismissal order. The representatives then turned to question Mr. Kuo Shih-yuan. According to the union, Mr. Kuo not only refused to recognize the union representatives but also threatened and insulted them with a gun. Public anger erupted at once, and the office of the Transportation Department was vandalized. Mr. Kuo was protected by union representatives and was fortunately unharmed. At about 1:30 PM, workers driving trams and buses on all routes heard the news and drove back to the factory, forming a strike.

### Three Demands Raised at the Provisional General Meeting

The workers held a provisional general meeting and resolved on three demands: (1) Dismiss Mr. Kuo Shih-yuan and never rehire him. (2) Revise the job regulations. (3) In the future, when the company hires new employees, it should adopt an examination system. Furthermore, because Mr. Kuo was the main protagonist in the Zhang Jinhai tragedy in the French Concession eight years ago (Mr. Kuo then ran the Yihua Laundry Company, now changed to a silk and satin company), the workers also raised the slogan of demanding a retrial of the Zhang case. After persuasion from all sides, the company authorities agreed to let Mr. Kuo take a few days off before the problem is resolved to facilitate the investigation, and once the facts are clarified, the company will handle it impartially.

### Grain Loan Case Concluded and Awaiting Judgment; Xu Jiqing and Xi Yushu Testify in Court; Both Claim No Knowledge of Official-Merchant Collusion

[Report from this Newspaper] The sensational grain loan corruption case, previously prosecuted by the District Procuratorate for violating the Extraordinary Period Agricultural, Mining, and Commercial Regulations, has been transferred to the District Court for trial. The case was concluded in a debate court yesterday morning at the District Court. After Judge Wu Xiangzu, along with Judges Huang Guangyu and Wu Ronglin, Prosecutor Zhang Yuanzhen, and Clerk Sun Yuan took their seats, the defendants in custody, Wang Darun, a grain official, and Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, and Wu Rongsheng, grain merchants, and the defendants on bail, Ren Xingyai, a grain official, and Wan Molin, Xing Zhigang, and Yang Runhui, grain merchants, were brought to court for interrogation. Xu Jiqing and Xi Yushu were also summoned to testify. The interrogation lasted for a long time yesterday, from 9:30 AM to around 1:00 PM. At the end, it was announced that the debate in the case was over, and the judgment was scheduled to be pronounced at 10:00 AM on the 18th.

Crucial Points in Interrogation; Focus on Three Aspects

The focus of yesterday's interrogation was to investigate whether there was collusion between officials and merchants, whether there were black market interest rates in addition to the stipulated 3% interest on loans to grain merchants, and whether fees were received for introducing grain merchants. The testimonies of the defendants were the same as in the previous three trials. Subsequently, Xu Jiqing, a witness and representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the Grain Loan Review Committee, testified: "In early spring last year, there was a severe rice shortage in the city. At that time, various groups proposed that the Ministry of Food purchase rice. After discussions among President Song, Minister Xu, and Mayor Wu and Director Wu of this city, along with leaders of various groups, it was decided to implement grain loans. First, eight companies were recommended by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and then eight companies were recommended by Wan Molin, the chairman of the Soy and Rice Industry Association, totaling sixteen rice shops. At that time, the authority of the Grain Loan Review Committee was to determine various principles and review the qualifications of grain merchants for loans. Wang Darun was the chairman of the committee, but he had no authority to decide everything during the review. I have not heard of any introduction fees or review fees being charged. In addition to the personally set interest rate of 3%, I have not heard of any so-called black market interest rates, and I have no knowledge of official-merchant collusion. As for the implementation of grain loans, it was originally a good policy, and if it could be maintained until now, rice prices might not have risen so much."

Price Increases in Production Areas Affect Shanghai Market

Another witness, Xi Yushu, testified that "I was representing the City Council in attending the Grain Loan Review Committee meeting. The grain loan was initiated by leaders from all walks of life in this city to purchase rice and relieve the panic of food shortages among the people of this city. At that time, we also considered that if we only purchased from Wuxi, the price of rice in Wuxi would definitely rise, so we separately designated areas such as Changshu and Songjiang. We suggested that the government loan 3 billion yuan to purchase 100,000 dan of rice first. Yang, the Special Commissioner of the Grain Administration, requested instructions from the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Finance, and only 2 billion yuan was approved, with 1 billion yuan allocated first, resulting in the purchase of only 30,000 dan of rice, which was far from the original plan. After the rice merchants arrived in the production areas, the price of rice in the production areas immediately rose, and as a result, the price of rice in this city also rose. This was a natural result and not the fault of the grain loan. Supervision of grain administration personnel is the responsibility of the Ministry of Food, and the Grain Loan Review Committee does not have this authority. As for whether there was official-merchant collusion, collection of black market interest rates, and fees, I have no knowledge of any of these."

Defense Attorney Argues for Amnesty

The prosecutor stated in his closing argument that "In addition to prosecuting this case for violating the Extraordinary Period Agricultural, Mining, and Commercial Regulations, if the presiding judge discovers other crimes committed by the defendants, he can also try them according to other laws." This statement was refuted by the defendants' lawyers, who stated: "According to Article 244 of the Criminal Procedure Law, if there are other crimes, additional charges should be filed. The prosecutor has not filed additional charges, and according to Article 247 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the court may not try crimes that have not been charged. As for the defendants being prosecuted for violating the Extraordinary Period Agricultural, Mining, and Commercial Regulations, according to the amnesty order issued by the National Government on New Year's Day, all are included in the amnesty and should be judged innocent by your court."

### Sheng Bingji Unable to Maintain Operations; Submits Request to the Social Bureau for Approval to Cease Operations

[Report from this Newspaper] Sheng Bingji Department Store, due to sluggish business and inability to maintain operations, submitted a document to the Social Bureau yesterday requesting approval to cease operations and lay off employees. It is reported that the store has three branches in Shanghai, with 60 employees. From January to May of this year, the total operating income and gross profit were over 188 million, while expenses were over 300 million, a considerable deficit. Now that the employee index for May has been announced, salary expenses will require an additional 35.94 million, making it impossible to maintain operations. Therefore, it requests to cease operations and lay off employees. The bureau will investigate and then decide on the appropriate measures.

### Index Disputes in Umbrella and Tofu Industries Resolved

[Report from this Newspaper] The index dispute in the umbrella industry has been resolved. Wages for May will be calculated at 23,500 times, with no discounts for those below $30, and a 10% discount for all those above $30.

Odds and ends will still be handled as before, with an additional 10% per dou, calculated based on the amount of wages earned on that day. Wages for this month will be calculated at $9,000 per unit of work, plus $900 per dou for odds and ends.

### Rare Treasure Awaits Claim; Emerald and Diamond Necklace; Reportedly a Qing Dynasty Relic

[Report from this Newspaper] The District Procuratorate will begin to solicit claims for a rare treasure. If no owner claims it within a reasonable time, it will be sent to a museum for public display and exhibition. It is learned that the treasure is a necklace made of a huge amount of emeralds, diamonds, and pearls, with extraordinarily exquisite workmanship. It is said to be a Qing Dynasty relic. On December 20th of last year, a petty thief named Zhao Songbai stole it from a foreign senior military officer in front of No. 186 Nanjing Road. Because the item was too valuable to sell, it was stored at the home of Xu Deming at No. 16 Linsen East Road, where it was discovered by the Old Gate Branch Bureau, who sent the petty thief Zhao Songbai and the stolen necklace to the court for interrogation. Zhao was released this spring due to the amnesty, and the stolen necklace was sealed by the District Procuratorate in the stolen goods room. It is said that it will soon be publicly solicited for claims.

Stolen by a Petty Thief and Currently Stored in the District Procuratorate

### Pre-War Wages Unreasonable; Wu Kaixian Discusses Worker Treatment; Sympathy for Workers Exists; Does Not Acknowledge Being Partial

[Report from this Newspaper] Social Bureau Director Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that since the decontrol of the cost of living index, there have been many sporadic disputes, but he believes that no major problems will occur. Regarding the request from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association to restore wages to the end of 1936, Director Wu said that the difference between the base salary at the end of 1936 and today's base salary is indeed large, but there are various factors that have contributed to the increase, such as: (1) In the past, the wages of workers in various factories in the concessions were mostly unreasonable, such as the fact that cotton mill workers only earned two cents a day, and their low standard of living was beyond comparison. If there were labor-management disputes, the police force could be dispatched to resolve them, so at that time, it was due to unilateral oppression, and it cannot be considered reasonable.

The municipal government still considers agreements signed by labor and management before the war to increase salaries at the end of the year to be valid. However, during the ten years of the War of Resistance from 1936 to 1946, workers did not dare to make demands under the threat of Japanese bayonets. It was not until after the victory that workers added salaries at once last year after negotiations. Now that the industrial and commercial sectors want to restore wages to the end of 1936, they are implicitly trying to write off the agreement to increase salaries at the end of the year, which is impossible to implement. For example, if cotton mill workers were to restore their base salary to two cents a day before the war, based on the cost of living index in May, their monthly income would only be over 100,000, which is not enough to even eat bean dregs. The poverty of Chinese capital is indeed a fact, but we cannot simply find a way out on the workers' backs; we should also consider sales, raw materials, and other aspects. Now, outsiders mostly accuse me of being partial to the labor side. While it is true that I have more sympathy for the workers, I cannot acknowledge being partial.

Shen Dingzhen, secretary general of the China Labor Association, also said that if some factories are indeed unable to bear the burden due to business reasons after the decontrol of the index, they can invite labor representatives, announce the economic situation, and resolve individual issues through open consultation. Workers are also willing to understand the factory's situation and negotiate reasonable figures to jointly maintain the industrial crisis. Now, the industrial sector is unilaterally seeking regulations that are beneficial to itself in various ways, while neglecting the rules for the welfare of workers, which is not the attitude that we should have when studying and resolving matters.

### Applications for Rice Allocation Deadline on the 21st; Thousands of Applications Received; Review Completed

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Chude, secretary of the Food Distribution Committee, told reporters yesterday that applications for rice allocation for factories, schools, and charities this month will close on the 21st. Approximately 1,000 of the previously submitted applications have been reviewed and notices have been issued for payment and allocation. The rice is shipped from Burma and is of excellent quality, priced at $240,000 per shi. This month, Shanghai received a total of 187,000 dan of rice allocated by the Ministry of Food, of which approximately 120,000 dan were allocated to schools, factories, and groups, and the remainder was used for subsidized rice sales to the poor. The poor in each district are being registered by the local baojia, and have not yet been reported, so the number of people is unknown. The amount of subsidized rice received per person is determined by the number of people, and is evenly distributed among the 67,000 dan. The standards for the age of the poor, large mouths, and small mouths have been set as three to fourteen years old for small mouths, and fourteen years old and above for large mouths.

### Families of the Officers and Soldiers Who Died on the Fubo Frigate Bivouac Overnight Outside the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Five Demands; Dispersed After a Meal

[Report from this Newspaper] Forty-five family members of the officers and soldiers who died on the Fubo gunboat, to demand emergency relief, petitioned the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company the day before yesterday. Deputy General Manager Shen Zhongyi received them and negotiated overnight, but no results were obtained. The family members wanted to enter the bureau, but the bureau did not agree. They bivouacked overnight outside the gate of the bureau the night before, and many police officers went to maintain order. The stalemate lasted until yesterday morning. Mayor Wu heard the news and sent Counselor Ge Kexin to the bureau to mediate. After several consultations, the families insisted on the following demands: (1) Xu Xueyu, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, should publish an apology to the families in the newspaper. (2) Request that the administrative adjudication and judicial judgment be carried out quickly. (3) Before the above issues are resolved, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company must, at a minimum, issue temporary relief funds according to the temporary relief measures of the Naval Headquarters on April 20 (1 million yuan for officers' and soldiers' families, 600,000 yuan for soldiers' families), based on the current cost of living index. (4) The food and accommodation expenses of all family members in Shanghai from the 9th to today will be borne by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. (5) In the future, the responsible persons of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company must not refuse to meet with the family members. Mr. Ge and Deputy General Manager Shen agreed to consult with General Manager Xu and reply at noon today. At 9:00 PM last night, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company treated all the petitioning family members to dinner before they dispersed. (The attached photo shows the family members waiting outside the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, taken by this newspaper)

### Visiting the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works; Self-Made Streamlined Train; Four Being Assembled and Expected to Be Used This Year

[Report from this Newspaper] Streamlined trains, which are popular in the United States, will soon be running on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line, in a style similar to the advertisements we often see in Western magazines. These vehicles are currently being manufactured by the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works. The planned train has a total of nine cars. In addition to the elliptical shape of the car body, there are many innovations in the internal equipment, such as doors and windows being insulated, using air conditioners to regulate the air and temperature inside the car, and having both air conditioning and heating, so that it will always be "as warm as spring indoors" regardless of winter or summer.

The seating area will also adopt a flexible design, which can be freely changed to a forward-facing or semi-reclining style according to people's preferences. In addition, the structure between the carriages will be closely connected, unlike the current trains, which have a considerable distance between them, so there is a sense of "integration."

As for the footboards at the entrances and exits at the four corners of the car, they can be hidden inside the car after the train starts, without revealing a trace on the outside.

When reporters visited the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works yesterday, they saw dozens of technicians working diligently, with four of them already being assembled. It is worth mentioning that the underframe and car body of this vehicle were all made by the factory itself.

According to Factory Director Lang Zhonglai and Engineers Liu Jinyi and Liu Changxia, the original plan was for the streamlined train to be completed this summer, but it was postponed due to delays in the delivery of internal air conditioning equipment. In addition to continuing to order from the United States, they are also planning to manufacture it themselves.

In addition to the main tasks of repairing and building locomotives and passenger and freight cars, the factory also operates by-products, such as refining coke, calcium carbide, and producing oxygen, to supply the needs of the factory and the railway. Regarding the repair of locomotives, the work efficiency was very low during the enemy puppet period, with an average of only three locomotives overhauled per month. Currently, it has gradually increased to nine locomotives overhauled per month. The US Military Advisory Group visited the factory before and gave high praise for the repair part.

### Unresolved Arbitration in Knitting Industry; New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory Once Surrounded

[Report from this newspaper] The wage dispute involving hand-operated knitting machines in the knitting industry was personally arbitrated yesterday by Director Lu of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The employer representatives deemed the workers' demands unacceptable, resulting in no agreement being reached. The case will be decided by the Social Bureau or referred for adjudication.

The silk weaving industry in Zones 1, 2, 3, and 4 submitted a petition to the Social Bureau for mediation regarding the issue of index discounts. After two rounds of negotiations, the differences in opinion between the two sides were too great, and some workers in the industry had already begun to slack off.

Over four hundred employees of the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory also had a dispute with the management regarding the index issue the night before last. The workers once surrounded the factory premises. They dispersed after being persuaded. The matter will be mediated by the Social Bureau.

Workers from machine sawmills, the tea and snack industry, Tongji Underwear Factory, and Yida Dyeing and Weaving Factory submitted documents to the Social Bureau, stating that the employers were not paying wages according to the May index and requesting mediation.

After fearing trouble, the management and workers of the Dazhong Metal Materials Factory agreed to calculate May wages at 85% of the index, with further negotiations to be held depending on the situation.

Regarding the lead printing industry dispute, the assessment committee rejected the thirteen yuan and five jiao meal allowance, so the original agreement was maintained. Index and other issues will be negotiated by both parties themselves. If negotiations fail, they will be submitted to the assessment committee for adjudication.

### Telecommunications Q&A

(Chen Boqun, Xiangyang South Road, this city, asks) (1) It is extremely difficult to get through on the telephone in this city between 10:30 AM and 1:00 PM. Is there any remedy? (Answer) Local calls within the jurisdiction of this bureau are not difficult. However, connecting to users of the Shanghai Telephone Company is difficult because the number of relay lines between this bureau and the various bureaus of that company, including the north and south districts, is currently only 220 pairs. According to statistics, users of this bureau account for over 90% at noon. Calls to and from users of the company must pass through these relay lines, leading to congestion and difficulty in getting through. This bureau is actively seeking improvements. (2) Can the "02" dialing system be abolished? (Answer) The automatic telephone keys of this bureau and the telephone company are not the same type, so the "02" dialing system must be used. Since this bureau took over, it has drafted a detailed unified plan, but due to financial and material limitations, it cannot completely replace the keys in the short term.

(Xu Tiancheng, Wuxi, asks) Waiting for long-distance telephone connections takes a very long time. I hope your bureau will actively improve this. (Answer) This bureau's long-distance telephone traffic is increasing dramatically every month, but the number of circuits is limited, resulting in supply not meeting demand. We are now planning to expand circuits in the more congested areas to remedy this.

(Tian Lin, Nanjing West Road, this city, asks) (1) What attitude does your bureau take towards reports of deliverymen demanding tips and gratuities? (Answer) This bureau strictly prohibits deliverymen from demanding tips. In the future, if any deliveryman from this bureau demands money from users, please refuse and provide the deliveryman's number and description to this bureau for investigation. (2) Can the names of the sending locations be written in Chinese? (Answer) This bureau now makes every effort to translate and deliver them. If there are omissions, please inquire by telephone (2490-22) or by coming to the bureau.

### 證金改繳美金債券問題　暫時准許變通辦是　在財經兩部未正式令遵以前　仍可以現金或美金債券抵充

[Our report] Regarding the issue of the Securities Exchange using US dollar bonds as substitutes for deferred transaction margin, Wang Bitang and Wu Gonglu, resident supervisors of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs at the Securities Exchange, received a temporary notice from the two ministries yesterday. They immediately prepared a document to forward to the Securities Exchange, ordering that before official instructions are received from the ministries, the part of the margin substitutes can temporarily still be replaced by cash or US dollar bonds.

According to the second instruction of the two ministries on the payment of bonds, it was limited to before the 16th of this month, and all parts of the margin substitutes had to be paid in US dollar bonds. However, brokers believe that the deadline is imminent and the reality is difficult to resolve. The council often sent Chairman Chen Jingmin, standing directors Yu Mingshi, Lin Zongjing and other three people to Beijing on the 11th to directly state the difficulties to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and hoped that the two ministries would take (1) the payment of bonds for the margin and (2) the re-extension of the deadline for submission into consideration and have a clear statement before the 16th of this month. The temporary notice of the two ministries to the resident supervisors of the Securities Exchange to temporarily implement a flexible method is equivalent to extending the current method of paying and submitting margin.

### 公會代表晉京　面陳處境困難

Chen Jingmin, Chairman of the Brokers Association of the Securities Exchange, standing directors Yu Mingshi, Lin Zongjing and other three people returned to Shanghai yesterday after going to Beijing on the 11th. According to Chen, who told reporters that this time the representatives of the Brokers Association stated the difficulties of the brokers to the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. There were neither requests nor appeals. Before the trip, the approval of the Securities Exchange authorities was obtained, and the Securities Exchange issued an introductory letter. After arriving in Beijing, they met with Director Dai of the Ministry of Finance, Director Deng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the section chiefs in charge of the two ministries to express their opinions: (1) Brokers are only intermediaries when it comes to substitutes for delivered margins being changed to US dollar bonds and the amount should be paid by the customer. Currently, since the bonds are still in the promotion period, most customers have not purchased them. As a result, when the first order of the ministry arrived, the brokers and customers were not prepared, which caused the market to be temporarily short that day, and it was not that the brokers deliberately stopped trading. In addition, since the entire margin for deferred delivery has been temporarily changed to cash payment, the margin deposited by the brokers has decreased by three-quarters. Therefore, it is still hoped that the authorities will allow stocks and bonds to be used together for the sake of maintaining the circulation and credit of stocks, and that there will be a clear indication before the 16th. (2) The deadline for deferred delivery is approaching on June 30. It is also hoped that the authorities will express something before the 16th as to whether it can be extended again so that there is something to follow. However, deferred delivery transactions are now the lifeline of broker transactions. It is hoped that the government should cultivate them as much as possible. If the government is dissatisfied with the deferred delivery market, it can add strict restrictions to the Securities Exchange's business rules and avoid making rigid regulations separately. The two ministries expressed their deep understanding of the points stated by the brokers. After Chen and others returned to Shanghai, they had a discussion with General Manager Wang of the Securities Exchange yesterday and settled on remedial measures in case the order from the ministry could not arrive on the 16th. In addition, they convened a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the brokers at 3 PM yesterday to report on the progress of the trip.

### 統債盤好　外股微升

Government bonds continued to perform well yesterday, with only Tong Wu slightly weak. Tong Bing opened at 7,400 yuan in the morning, with a low of 7,000 yuan, a high of 8,000 yuan, and finally hovered around 7,500 yuan. Rooms 552 and 555 sold, while rooms 533 and 503 bought, with a transaction volume of approximately 5.6 million. As a result, Jia and Yi rose by 300 yuan compared to the previous close, Bing rose by 100 yuan, Ding rose by 200 yuan, and Tong Wu was still 300 yuan lower.

Foreign stocks continued to shine yesterday. Ewo Filature opened at 58,000 yuan in the morning, and demand from Guangbang and foreign merchants was relatively strong. The gold industry supplied, and the securities brokers went in and out because the Chinese stocks were also returning after being strong. The high reached 62,000 yuan, and then retreated to struggle at the 60,000 yuan mark. Hong Kong Shanghai Telegraph was at 15.2 yuan, with very little stimulation. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Ewo Brewery, Guang Paper, and Aviation each rose by 10%, Ewo Filature, Steel, and Wheelock Marden each rose by more than half a percentage point, and although British American Tobacco rose, it was not much.

### 人絲買氣濃厚

The market for rayon was strong again yesterday. No. 120 Asahi Ziji Youguang was in high demand from all parties and showed a straight upward trend. By the noon close, it was quoted at 18.8 million yuan. The largest price for the Toyo brand reached 9.15 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was some profit-taking at high prices, so there was a slight decline. The final price was 8.5 million yuan sold, up 800,000 yuan from the previous day. The factory price remained weak, and there were still no transactions for the high-uniformity five-dan head. The silk factory brokers' demand was very weak. Dachang satin face was quoted at 9 million yuan, and Huagang satin face was traded at 8.8 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan from the previous day. Da Gezi Fengxiang's market was weak because there were more sellers than buyers. The middle price was 3,500 yuan. The closing price was 3,300 yuan, down 300 yuan from the previous day.

### 食米市况轉堅

Yesterday, the north and south markets received more than 6,400 shi of rice in total. Suburban villages and farms were more active, with indica rice being the most popular, and the market turned strong, rising sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Japonica rice also rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan along with it. The removal of flour remained weak, and the market turned slack. Soybean cake trading was not strong, and factory cake rose sharply by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Shantou accepted yellow beans, and prices rose by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Northern sorghum was inquired about and accepted by distilleries, and prices soared by more than 10,000 yuan. Northern corn was purchased and prices rose by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Sesame was actively traded by foreign firms and prices soared by 10,000 yuan. New yuan wheat fell sharply by 10,000 yuan. The oil market, with goods from the Northeast and Qingdao, saw a slight increase in exchange.

### 小麥貸欵　原則已核准　下週內可望貸放

The government has approved in principle the wheat loan applied for by flour mills. Detailed measures are still being discussed. It is expected that the Four Joint Offices will approve it next month and implement the loan. At that time, large and small factories can apply for the loan. The flour factories are now preparing to purchase a large amount of wheat in the producing areas in order to resume production.

In addition, according to a letter from the Flour Industry Association of the Fourth District, the directors and supervisors of the association have not met with Director Wang recently. The content of the conversation reported in yesterday's newspaper has a great impact on the industry and cannot be silently accepted.

### 食糖續跌

The sugar market continued to weaken yesterday, and the inflow and outflow were also sparse. The association's opening price for Peruvian sand was firm at 575,000 yuan, and later at 568,000 yuan, down by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. No. 20 Taichung sand white was 470,000 yuan, and Taiwan red was 370,000 yuan, each down by 5,000 yuan. No. 3 half-car white was 510,000 yuan, down by 10,000 yuan. Haohuo Shantou Qing opened at 320,000 yuan to 316,000 yuan, down by 4,000 yuan. Xinghua white was 450,000 yuan to 434,000 yuan, down by more than 10,000 yuan. Xing red was 334,000 yuan, Diao Qing was 290,000 yuan, and the total transaction was less than 300 pieces.

### 白煤疲軟

The arrival of white coal is abundant, and it is difficult to sell smoothly for a while, and the trend is still weak. For the upper-grade goods of bituminous coal, such as Kaili crumbs and Fuxin layers, there are goods supplied on the market, and the market price is seeing a downturn.

Chinese stocks saw an improvement yesterday, but the gains were still limited to Yongsha, and the remaining stocks were just following suit. A 30% cash guarantee can temporarily maintain the status quo, and other proposals are difficult to resolve for the time being. Yongsha had repeatedly approached the limit, but was reversed before closing due to rumors of the retreat of Ambassador Su. The reason is that retail investors are still stuck with the 30% margin and cannot do what they want. The arbitrage market for Yongsha is still only around 120, and the combined interest price is only a dime. Very few transactions were made by China General Business No. 178. The agency collection and settlement number company still opens the interest price at 16.5 cents and 2.1 cents, which is very different, and the entire stock market is still waiting to be clarified. The morning opening was slightly higher, and Yongsha opened at 5,870 yuan and rose to 6,010 yuan. Nos. 226, 100, 173, and 83 were sold to 5,920 yuan. Nos. 163, 190, 155, 153, 85, and 76 took the opportunity to reach 6,060 yuan. Nos. 157, 180, 106, 83, and 65 were sold, and No. 231 even came to short sell, retreating to 5,950 yuan. Nos. 102, 97, 8, 218, 76, 234, 89, 65, 32, 218, and 14 all accepted, and the Yongsha disk rose to 6,160 yuan. At this time, many retail investors took profits, and Nos. 104, 91, and 36 were sold, retreating to around 6,050 yuan. Nos. 102, 157, 65, 32, 234, 232, 223, 153, 129, and 130 bought in unison, and Commerce was the first to raise the price to the limit by No. 157, etc. Now the US Asia delivery is also approaching the limit, and the Yongsha delivery rose to 6,300 yuan, which is equivalent to reaching 6,150 yuan. Nos. 32, 76, and 224 were sold off, falling to 6,200 yuan. Nos. 157, 32, 213, and 152 are still buying in, and Nos. 213 and 152 are also buying now Yongsha, and the delivery rose to 6,320 yuan. Now Yongsha rose to 6,170 yuan. Nos. 186, 15, and 31 were sold, falling to 6,170 yuan. At this time, No. 224 supplemented more, and New Asia also reached the limit, and then rose to 6,300 yuan. The news of Ambassador Su's return to China made sensitive people end their positions, and the selling atmosphere gradually increased for a while. Nos. 154, 76, 157, 163, 85, and 183 were all sold, and the price fell to 6,000 yuan before closing. Nos. 186 and 117 were replenished and ended at 6,100 yuan. After the close, No. 223 was sold, reducing the price to below 6,050 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Xinhua was flat, Yonggong rose by 10%, Yongsha, New Light, and Sino-French each rose by about half a percentage point, Xinhe and US Asia Jingfu Huafeng Qinxing rose slightly, Commerce rose to the limit, Cement and Wuhai rose slightly, Jinglun rose by 10%, Datong Zhongfang Rongfeng Lian each rose by more than half a percentage point, Firecracker New Asia rose to the limit and then returned, the former rose by half a percentage point, and the latter was just flat. For deferred delivery stocks, Xinguang Yonggong Jingou rose slightly, as did Huafeng, and US Asia rose to the limit and then returned, and Yongsha rose by half a percentage point. Dongxing was particularly good at 10%. The asking prices for various old stocks outside the market saw an increase, but they were still oversupplied.

### 聯華定期上市

Lianhua Real Estate Industry has been approved to be listed on a trial basis and will be launched on the 16th, with 10,000 shares as a unit.

### 茶市未見起色

Yesterday, there was no improvement in transactions in the foreign firms' tea market, but the market remained unchanged due to the flat selling pressure. Green tea cores, which are in demand in Tianjin, had varying asking prices, and there were few transactions. Other varieties were stably priced, as the demand from local and out-of-town buyers was continuous.

### 到期折金存款　仍應付給黃金　財部電四聯轉知

Regarding the case of paying out gold for matured gold-convertible deposits, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that gold should be paid out at the original depositing bank, and the Shanghai banks could also pay out on behalf of the original banks. It is now known that the Four Joint Offices approved the banks to send letters successively, roughly stating that the government now prohibits the sale and purchase of gold, and the Central Bank purchases it at a listed price, which is different from the previous free trade situation. How should the remaining unredeemed gold-convertible deposits of all banks be handled without clear regulations? Also, if gold-convertible depositors request to pay out legal tender at the Central Bank's listed price in the way of agency collection, can this be done? In order to make the handling of each bank consistent, please make overall coordination and deliberation. Now the Four Joint Offices forwarded the reply from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the payment of gold-convertible deposits is different from the trading of gold. All gold-convertible deposits handled by each bank should still be paid out in gold upon maturity to comply with the original agreement. As for the price of collecting gold, it has been approved by the Central Bank at 480,000 yuan per tael. For the payment of gold deposit certificates upon maturity, the fractional amount should be calculated according to the above price and converted into national currency.

### 紡建估價委會　通過廿六年單價　全部估價工作需時一月餘

The approved unit price will be printed and distributed to the various factories under the Textile Construction Company for filling in separately. As for the issue of the index to be added to the unit price, it will be decided by the valuation working group and then submitted for approval. The entire valuation work will take at least one month to complete.

[Another report] It is reported that the unit price of the main fixed assets of the Textile Construction Company in the 26th year of the Republic of China, based on spindles, including related equipment, is estimated at about 70 to 80 yuan in legal tender per spindle. Based on looms, ordinary looms are about 700 to 800 yuan per unit, and automatic looms are about 800 to 1,000 yuan per unit.

[Another report] Zou Bingwen, who will be the chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, attended the banquet of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association at noon yesterday at the request of the association. During the banquet, he extensively exchanged opinions on the entire cotton textile industry, and the meeting adjourned at around 3 PM. According to Zou, who told reporters after the meeting, the discussion was very good.

### 劉泗英談　出售問題

Liu Siying, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, came to Shanghai a few days ago to preside over the Textile Construction Valuation Committee meeting, and returned to Beijing last night after completing his official duties. Before his departure, Liu told reporters that the Textile Construction Company will not be sold in its entirety. 30% will still be retained as state-owned, and the remaining 70% will be divided into the smallest units, put out to tender for sale, or issue stocks. When more than half of the stocks of each unit are issued, the rights to manage the business unit will be transferred to the commercial shareholders. As for the part for sale, it will be limited to factory buildings, machinery, and land, and the cost of raw materials will not be included. The valuation standard has been decided to be calculated according to the price index of the 26th year of the Republic of China. After the entire valuation work is completed, it will be reported to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Liu continued to explain the purpose of selling state-owned enterprises, saying that this move is to promote private enterprises and balance the national budget. He said that the state-owned enterprises that have been decided to sell are worth 10 trillion yuan. Liu believes that the economic reform plan being studied by the All-Economic Council is based on the economic emergency measures plan, but it will remove the inappropriate parts, so the reform plan is permanent.

### 紡建售紗

[Our report] China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 517 pieces, all to manufacturers. There were a total of 280 applicants.

### 紡管會奉令撤銷　正準備接收中

Later, Director Liu of the Business Department of the committee went to Beijing to ask for instructions. It was considered that the various businesses currently handled by the committee cannot be interrupted for a day, so it was decided that the business would continue as usual, but be prepared for takeover. As for how to accept, we are still waiting for instructions from the ministry. It is heard that there are 58 employees in the committee, of which 33 are in the Business Department, and 20 of them were borrowed from the Textile Construction Company, so there will be no difficulty in personnel transfer when the handling is completed.

In addition, the committee has already notified the quota of each manufacturer for the transportation of yarn and cloth to the north. Applications can be accepted starting from the 16th. Since applications for the transportation of yarn and cloth to the south started on the 11th, certificates have been issued and transportation to the south has begun.

Spring and Autumn

### Reminiscences of Mr. Mang Ni

— Li Baifeng

Passing by Fuzhou Road at noon, I saw a Beijing bronze ink box at a secondhand stall. Engraved on it were plum blossoms and a poem by Mr. Mangfu. I couldn't help but recall the plump Mr. Mangfu from twenty years ago. After buying this ink box and wiping it clean, the familiar handwriting immediately brought back several past events to my mind.

Almost all who enjoy collecting Beijing bronze ink boxes are familiar with Mr. Yao Mangfu and Mr. Chen Shizeng, aren't they? When they enjoyed great fame in Beijing, people like Qi Baishi and Xu Beihong were still unknown! On silk fans and in studies, it could be said that the upper class of Peiping at that time was filled with Mangfu's calligraphy, paintings, and bronze engravings. The "Qianyang Chun" at the corner of Xidan Archway was also founded by Mr. Mangfu. On fine days in spring and autumn, the distinguished and elegant people who gathered there could be said to represent the height of "the capital."

I remember seeing Mr. Mangfu at Mr. Zhang Lianxi's house back then. He was already quite stout, and his Mandarin, heavily accented with the Qian dialect, complemented his hearty personality and his spirited writing, leaving a deep impression on my young mind.

After my father retired, few people visited. But in his study and garden, this plump "celebrity" sometimes came, discussing poetry and prose. The romantic scenes of moonlight and flowers have become a thing of the past, yet when I think of them now, I still have a vague sense of "dreamy beauty."

Because my father and Mr. Mangfu were childhood friends, I often saw Mr. Mangfu and Mr. Shizeng and other seniors when I was young and attending my father. Unfortunately, not long after Mr. Mangfu passed away, my father failed in an investment and owed debts to the Zhongfu Bank, which plunged the family into bankruptcy. As a result, my father had to travel and make a living alone. Because there was nothing of value left in the house to pawn, one day, I was sent to Liulichang with a scroll by Mr. Mangfu, a double-sided folding fan, and a volume of his early poems. In the end, under the hateful faces of the merchants, the scroll and fan were bought for two dollars. I clutched that volume of Mr. Mangfu's early poems, which they called a forgery, and returned home with a feeling of infinite sadness.

More than ten years passed quickly in the midst of war. Once, in Mr. Xiong Foxi's Pomegranate Garden in Guilin, we talked about Mr. Mangfu, and everyone sighed with regret for him. Thinking of my cousin XX, who relied on selling Mr. Mangfu's old books to make a living, now that he is wealthy and prominent, I suppose he doesn't have many of his ancestor's remaining works left either?

Foxi also told me a little anecdote about Mr. Mangfu:

On the opening day of Qianyang Chun, the city of Beijing was truly buzzing. Old painters like Wang Mengbai each brought very valuable masterpieces as congratulatory gifts. Almost everyone had arrived, except for Mr. Shizeng, which puzzled everyone.

According to the private friendship between Mr. Mangfu and Mr. Shizeng, he should not have been absent today, and everyone guessed that Shizeng would definitely bring a valuable gift, so the host and the guests were very concerned.

Later, Mr. Shizeng did arrive, and as everyone expected, he brought a carefully painted large scroll. Everyone urged the host and Mr. Shizeng to open the central hall and take a look. It turned out to be a famous work by Shizeng; on the six-foot painting, there was a large wine jar with a branch of Osmanthus hanging down. The Osmanthus seemed to be intoxicated by the aroma of wine, and the flowers fell into the jar:

Such a famous painting naturally impressed everyone; especially the host, Mr. Mangfu, who was delighted. He eagerly asked those present to inscribe poems on the painting and hung it in the center of the hall. This respectful attitude towards Shizeng, compared with the literary world's habit of mutual disparagement among scholars, could not help but make people feel emotional.

Two years later, Qianyang Chun went out of business due to poor management, and the manager secretly ran away; but this manager did not touch any money or property, he only stole Mr. Shizeng's painting from the center of the hall. At that time, Mr. Shizeng had already passed away, and Mr. Mangfu naturally felt very sad. He offered a reward of four hundred dollars and finally found the painting.

Seeing the painting returned to its owner, and at the same time adding a feeling of remembering someone through an object, Mr. Mangfu wrote the whole story of its loss and recovery on the side of the painting. In this way, Qianyang Chun reopened, and of course the painting was still hung in its original place.

It's truly a matter of coincidence, Qianyang Chun unfortunately went through a second liquidation. Strangely enough, the manager stole the painting as usual, which made Mr. Mangfu very distressed. We can imagine that under such circumstances, the blow to his spirit was a hundred times greater than the closing of Qianyang Chun!

Later, this painting did not reappear until after Mr. Mangfu's death. Unfortunately, during the war, no one ever heard any news about its whereabouts.

Today, when the scholar-official spirit and the style of the celebrities have been abandoned, not to mention the sorrow of the death of both the person and the zither, even the White Stone Old Man, who was more recent than Mangfu and enjoyed great fame in the contemporary era, felt that his exhibition in Shanghai after ten years of dust was somewhat crude and shoddy. In today's world, when "the rituals of the Han officials are no longer seen anywhere," I can still afford to buy a Beijing bronze ink box painted by Mr. Mangfu in my spare time, which cannot help but remind me of the past like smoke.

I don't know from which declining family this ink box flowed into the city, and as for me, I have lost too many books and manuscripts in the war, and I cannot guarantee that I will always be able to preserve it. Looking at this ink box with its "face full of mist and clouds," and the inscription on it: "In it, there is boundless fixed flower light, the spring air is smoky and contains a special fragrance; where is the guest in the half-sleeved yellow shirt, a long flute fills the building with frost," I immediately think of how this is exactly the season of: "Playing the jade flute in the twelfth tower, plum blossoms fall in the fifth month of the river city." And in Shanghai, let alone poets and writers, there is also some air of young rascals from foreign concessions.

Mangfu's landscapes mostly depict layered trees stacked with green, with a majestic spirit and a high and ancient style, unlike today's splashed ink, which lacks scholarly atmosphere and looks vulgar at a glance. His calligraphy is very similar to that of Yuan Hanyun, and both benefited from Zheng Sucan; however, the early regular script calligraphy of Mr. Mangfu stored in my house is based on Zhao Songxue, and its profound skill is also extraordinary.

### Record of Chen Wangdao

— Yao Tianyu

Mentioning Mr. Daowei invariably makes one think of his nickname (given to him by others), "Crooked Mouth Daoist." Indeed, his appearance is quite lacking. But if we were to measure him with an attitude of "judging people by their appearance," we would be "missing Zi Yu." Because although his appearance is not outstanding, his character and spirit of scholarship are not to be underestimated.

Speaking of his character, he is truly a good old gentleman. He never offends anyone, and he also has a passion for helping others. For example, if you have any requests, as long as it is within his ability, he will never disappoint you. This is known to all who have even a single encounter with him.

In terms of scholarship, it is even more worthy of our admiration. He is known for his rigor in governing all kinds of learning. Taking the field of rhetoric as an example, which is the subject he has studied most thoroughly, if you have ever read his book "An Elementary Discourse on Rhetoric," you can discover that the principles of rhetoric are explained in exceptional detail and clarity, with absolutely no hint of sloppiness or carelessness. Secondly, he also has a thorough study of aesthetic theory.

He usually does not easily pick up a pen to write articles. Sometimes, when he writes an article, every word and sentence must go through many careful considerations. And every article, from beginning to end, is full of key sentences, with absolutely no unnecessary meaning interspersed. And the beauty of the language goes without saying. Chen Guangsheng, as a person who is proficient in rhetoric and composition, certainly has these characteristics.

Mr. Chen used to be the chief editor of the "Taibai Bimonthly," and the texts published in it were all personally selected by him using strict standards. Therefore, each issue was excellent and was welcomed by readers. It is especially worth mentioning that each issue contained scientific essays written in beautiful and vivid language, which other publications lacked. It is a pity that this publication was short-lived. We hope that Mr. Chen can revive it in the near future.

Mr. Chen used to be the director of the Department of Chinese Literature at Shanghai University, founded by Yu Youren. Under his leadership, all the professors were well-known figures in the academic and literary circles in the country, so there were particularly many students in this department. And most of the students he cultivated have now become famous writers in the literary world.

He is also a professor at Fudan University, and his relationship with Fudan has never been interrupted. It is said that he is still teaching at Fudan. In late autumn last year, I met him on some occasion and felt that he looked somewhat old now.

### Poetic Words

— Shen Xianyuan

Poetry is fresh language, a flash of light in people's realm of consciousness; this source of light truly exists in the universe.

Therefore, not everything written on paper can be considered poetry, it is the reality of the universe, a complete and beautiful emotion that is most easily overlooked or cannot be captured. — Where there is life and beauty, there is poetry!

### A Record of Ma Zongrong

— Li Rongru

Ma Zongrong, this brilliant name in the literary world, is a well-known old writer.

Professor Ma studied in France in his early years and has a profound understanding of French. In his vast works, most are translations. For example, his novel "Spring Tide," translated from French, has a delicate and concise style, and is especially rich in infinite fresh and meaningful, just like a beautiful prose poem, making it impossible to put down once read. He is a famous old professor at Fudan, and the courses he teaches are the history of fiction, French, and Freshman Chinese.

When he lectures, he uses humorous and interesting language. He usually cites examples from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign, to explain profound and boring theories in a simple and easy-to-understand way, which is very popular among students.

It is said that writers from ancient times to the present have mostly been unkempt; either their faces are full of thought, or their hair is disheveled, and they are unrestrained. Some say this is affected, while others say it is transcendence and should be the lifestyle adopted by writers. However, our old writer is not like this. He wears a neat suit, carries a shiny cane, and walks to and from school with a lively spirit. That serious and neat gentleman's air cannot help but give people a feeling of respect.

He lives in the Fudan faculty dormitory, a small Japanese-style house, which is arranged in an orderly manner. When the author visited him last time, the desk was full of dictionaries and reference books, and he was diligently translating the famous French book "Zola's Biography"! He is a very eloquent speaker and can talk about everything from life and the universe to trivial matters between men and women, talking for hours.

His temperament is very upright, and he criticizes things that he doesn't like without hesitation. Although he is already fifty years old, his heart is still young.

### About Hong Weifa

— Zhang Wuchun

Introducing the author of "Continuing the Dream of Yangzhou"

Among the works in the Shen Bao Spring and Autumn, Hong Weifa's "Continuing the Dream of Yangzhou" is also a popular one. Taking this opportunity to talk about his character will probably be welcomed by readers.

Needless to say, he is an old Yangzhou native, a true Yangzhou expert. Anything related to Yangzhou, whether ancient or modern, can be found on his bookshelves. He has a small family with a large number of people, and the house, which should be enough, is mostly occupied by his bookshelves, forcing his family to move to the corners of the walls.

When he was studying in middle school, his math and science grades were very good. Because he couldn't afford foreign books, he had no choice but to study "zhizihu zheye" in college.

He has been a minor bureaucrat. Not that he was impatient with signing papers and working, but the political atmosphere in China didn't suit him. He has a conscience, justice, and a brain full of ideas. Regarding a certain matter, he sometimes seemed to want to add a bit of "I think." He knew deeply that "the Way cannot be practiced," so he had to voluntarily return to a career in education.

He is an expert in literary stories and has published specialized books "Selected Stories of Chinese Literati" and "Talking About Literati." Indeed, there are few literati, not only in official Chinese history but even in unofficial histories, novels, poetry talks, and lyrics talks, who have even a few words to pass on that he does not know. Zhang Chunshui, Bao Xiyang, Cui Huangye, Guan Xinghua, talking about them is always like talking about his old friends. If you mention Ruan Yuan to him, he will immediately say "When Ruan Yuan was poor—" and immediately tell you a long string of stories that people don't easily know. Once, the author was walking with him in the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang, passing by the old site of Mi Fu's tomb, he walked and told me the story of Mi the Madman, one after another, like sawing wood, ceaselessly. If he were to be a guide to famous places, he would not only make people enjoy the scenery but also make them happy.

He is a standard teacher. During the War of Resistance, he always taught in northern Jiangsu. The school he was in—the First Provisional Middle School of the Province—was the truly first good middle school in northern Jiangsu. Therefore, every intellectual in the areas of northern Jiangsu under the control of the central government knew about "Teacher Hong." "Teacher Hong" became his nickname. Every student was afraid of him and respected him. His guiding principle was "Being a person first," and he never hesitated. He is truly a traditional teacher who is "awe-inspiring to look at, yet gentle to approach." Because today's teachers' standards are too "that" and students are too democratic, making it inconvenient to be jointly responsible, he has no intention of talking about "the troubles of people."

He writes excellent lyrics. His lyrics are not easy for superficial people to understand. He specializes in putting effort into the four words "deep, melancholy, pause, and cadence," which is the lyric law revealed by Mr. Chen Yifeng of Dantu, the great master of Chinese lyric criticism, in his masterpiece Bai Liangzhai Lyric Talks. Therefore, appreciating his lyrics requires the effort of secretly chanting and quietly humming.

His old poems are also not bad, and at the same time, he is a theorist of old poems. He has published three works: "On Quatrains," "On Regulated Verses," and "On Ancient Poetry." To see his prose, "Continuing the Dream of Yangzhou" can be used as a sample.

He possesses the traditional characteristics of Chinese literati: a fondness for wine. Mentioning wine to him is like talking to a high school boy about his girlfriend, determined to get her and determined to get drunk. Believe it or not, before sitting down, he seems to already be three parts drunk when he sees the shadow of the wine pot. He has the appearance of being drunk without drinking; I see it in this person. Accompanying him during regular meals is often an exquisite ancestral small wine pot. His entertainment, fantasies, inspiration, and even his world are in that small wine pot. After getting drunk, clouds and mists flow out and become chapters. I'll tell you a secret, at this time, if you want to discuss any issue with him, it will definitely work: "Good, good, good," he says, squinting, "There is no problem in the world that cannot be discussed. Hehe!"

When he goes to a friend's house, he especially likes to praise the wife unconditionally (whether she is worthy of praise is another matter). His secret is not to praise all aspects of the wife, because general "good, good, good" sounds perfunctory; it is to praise a certain aspect of her, so the wife believes that she has a superhuman trait and is proud of herself. Even if she is so poor that she has to cut her hair, she is happy to welcome this guest. The words of praise he uses are, for example: Mrs. Wang's self-made cheongsam pattern is better than that of a dressmaker; Mrs. Li's braised crucian carp soup is fresher than in a restaurant; Mrs. Lin's self-created perm style is most in line with artistic requirements... and so on.

But what does his standard wife look like in his mind? That is the five-character truth he has gained after decades of experience and after thousands of trials and tribulations: "Speak less and smile more."

He also plays a pathetically small game of mahjong, but he plays mahjong for the sake of playing mahjong, not at all careless. He always puts on a research-style reserved attitude, often thinking three times before firing a shot.

The author has been insulted by puppet soldiers and traitors and often wants to retaliate. He does not advocate it. He says: "In today's world, one only seeks to survive; today you cannot kill the monsters and demons, tomorrow they will still become authorities, Chinese bad people have the most ways, hey hey!"

In his youth, he acted according to books and offended many people. "People all say I am more flexible," he says, "You should know that I hardened my heart and deliberately lowered my moral standards in order to gain these two words of flexible." Finally, he sighs: "Alas!" This sigh is probably the common sigh of many middle-aged people?
