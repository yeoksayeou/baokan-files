President Chiang Kai-shek, as chairman, delivered a detailed analysis of the current international, domestic, political, and military situation, which was extremely earnest and lasted for seventy minutes. The meeting adjourned for a break at 4:30 PM. President Chiang Kai-shek, having other important matters to attend to, left the meeting first. After the break, Committee Member Sun Ke chaired the continuation of the discussion. The committee members actively expressed their opinions. Those responsible for practical political affairs in the National Government and the Executive Yuan almost all spoke. Veterans such as Dai Chuanxian and Yu Youren also offered their opinions. Finally, three points were decided: (1) To strengthen the military suppression of the Communists, (2) To concentrate the strength of the Party and the Youth Corps, and (3) To handle elections in accordance with the preparatory procedures for the implementation of constitutional government. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) Madam Chiang Kai-shek also attended the joint meeting of the Guomindang Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee on the 30th. Madam Chiang entered the venue with the President at 3:10 PM. The Madam wore a white silk cheongsam with black flowers. During the President's address, the Madam sat quietly and listened attentively, paying close attention. At the 4:30 PM break, the President, having other important matters, left first, and the Madam left the venue at the same time.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) Central government officials Wu Dingchang, Bai Chongxi, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Sun Ke, and others held a small group meeting after the weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen on the 30th to discuss decisions regarding the current situation.

It was only decided that the opinions of all parties would be submitted to the afternoon's joint meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee for discussion.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) To clarify the current situation, the central government will issue a proclamation, possibly to be announced this weekend. The purpose of this proclamation is to announce to China and the world the government's views and decisions on the current situation, so that international audiences will understand the true situation and the people of the country will know what to follow. The State Council meeting to be held on the 4th will discuss this and make specific provisions, which will then be officially announced by the National Government.

### National Army Wins Victory and Meets in Siping; Northeast War Enters New Phase; Troops on the Jilin-Changchun Line Recover Huapichang

(Central News Agency Urgent Telegram from Siping, 30th, 11:00 AM) The National Army, coming from the north to reinforce Siping, captured Mengpingshao on the night of the 29th and pursued the victory. At 9:45 AM on the morning of the 30th, they met in the south of the city, and entered the city at 10:10 AM.

(Our Shenyang Dispatch, 30th) The Siping garrison met with the National Army from the south at approximately 9:00 AM on the morning of the 30th, between Mengniushao and Siping. This is an unprecedented victory for the National Army in the Northeast. The Siping garrison launched a southward attack on the night of the 29th, and the National Army advancing from the north advanced northward from Mengniushao at 2:00 AM on the morning of the 30th, completing the mission of relieving the siege and meeting. There is a major celebration here, and newspapers are issuing extra editions.

(Our Changchun Dispatch, 30th) The National Army advancing from Changtu met with the Siping garrison at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 30th. The Communist army collapsed and retreated in two directions, east and west. The National Army advancing southward from Gongzhuling will soon join forces with the National Army advancing from the north. The Communist army on the north bank of the Liao River has been cleared, and the Communist army on the Jilin-Changchun line has retreated to the Jilin-Shenyang line.

(Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th) The siege of Siping has been lifted. The National Army advancing from the north in thirty-six hours defeated the main force of the Second Column of the Communist army that was blocking them at Siping Nanfengmiaozi. Before dawn on the 30th, they met with the Siping garrison, which had fought bitterly for seventeen days and nights. The remnants of the Communist army collapsed and retreated towards Huoshiling and Bamiancheng, east and west of Siping. The battle of Siping has given the Communist army a major lesson. They colluded with the North Korean and Korean Communists, and used Japanese prisoners of war, to launch a fierce attack on Siping with tens of thousands of troops, ten times the size of the garrison, but failed to take it. Instead, they suffered a disastrous defeat and dispersal, with casualties reaching half of their force. The Communist army's attempt to rely on foreign forces to rebel and secede from the national territory should have caused them to reflect during the seventeen-day battle to besiege Siping.

(Our Changchun Dispatch, 30th) Now that the siege of Siping has been lifted, the Changchun-Shenyang advance forces are about to meet, and the situation in the Northeast has entered a new phase. The Communist army's so-called summer offensive has now come to an end. However, according to authoritative observers, the future situation in the Northeast depends entirely on the next seven to fourteen months. Recalling the situation in the past six months, the Communist army launched an offensive every two months. In order for the Northeast to achieve permanent stability in the future, it is necessary to change the previous approach and make necessary changes to all military and political facilities. Otherwise, after these four months, even if there is a desire to act, it will be difficult to do so due to the environment. Currently, Andong is still controlled by the Communist army, and it must be recovered, so that the Communist army in the Northeast has no way to connect in the north and south. The damage to the China Changchun Railway is too great, and repairs will not be completed in a short time. Currently, efforts are being made to repair the highway first, so that north-south passenger and freight transport can be interconnected. Cars have already been tested between Changchun and Gongzhuling yesterday.

(Central News Agency, Shenyang, 30th) Director Du recently told reporters that the victory at Siping is of great significance, relating to the entire war situation in the Northeast.

(Central News Agency, Changchun, 30th) This afternoon, the citizens of Changchun listened to the news of the lifting of the siege of Siping and the collapse of the Communist army with extremely excited emotions. Several newspapers also published extra editions. Street corners are full of newspapers with this news. Now, the citizens of Changchun have shifted their focus from the battle situation in the Siping urban area to the results of the National Army's capture of the fleeing Communist army, as they deeply know that this is directly related to the long-term stability of Changchun in the future. Therefore, many people judge that the general prices in Changchun will soon fall.

(Central News Agency, Jilin, 30th) Our troops advancing westward along the Jilin-Changchun Railway launched a dawn attack on the morning of the 30th. After a brief battle with the Communist army at Huapichang, they entered the Huapichang railway station at 7:00 AM, and immediately continued to fight towards the Huapichang urban area (one kilometer south of the railway station). The Communist army struggled desperately, and the artillery fire was quite fierce. Our army charged repeatedly, and finally completely captured Huapichang at about 8:00 AM. The Communist army's 103rd Division, stationed in Huapichang, numbering about 1,500, was severely attacked by our army on the morning of the 30th. Their remnants fled from the mountainous area below Huapichang to Qitamu and Liangjiazi. The National Army is tracking and pursuing them.

### Communist Army in Lushan Area Cut into Two Sections; Recover Zhangqiu City in Jiaodong; National Army in the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway Carries Out Encirclement

(Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 30th) The National Army's attack on the Yimeng Mountain area is progressing rapidly. It has reached the heart of the mountainous area, more than fifty kilometers from Xinhai and only ten kilometers from Donglidian, where the headquarters of the Communist Army's East China Field Army is located. After suffering heavy casualties, Chen Yi was forced to withdraw his headquarters to Qixiong. As of the evening of the 30th, eight columns of the Communist army in the mountainous area have been cut into two sections, making it easier to annihilate them separately.

(Our Jinan Dispatch, 30th) The Wang Yaowu Corps, attacking eastward along the Jiaoji Railway in response to the National Army in the Yimeng Mountain area, has made new progress. After recovering Mingshui on the 29th, the corps divided its troops into three routes. One route went north and recovered Zhangqiu City that evening. One route advanced east and reached near Puju on the evening of the 30th. One route went south along the Minglai Highway and recovered Wenzu Town that evening, and occupied Heiyuzhuang on the afternoon of the 30th. By evening, the advance force had occupied Ziyangguan. This is located at the border between Zi and Qi counties, with dangerous terrain, thirty-five kilometers north of Mingshui and less than thirty kilometers south of Laiwu. The meeting with Ou Zhen's troops in Laiwu is imminent.

(Our Lixian Dispatch, 30th) Wang Tiewu flew from Lixian back to Jinan at 10:00 AM on the 30th. He stayed in Lixian for one day and expressed satisfaction with the seamless cooperation between the military and political authorities in Lixian.

(Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 30th) Near Xihuanghe and Hebei Shore in counties of Fan, Xiao and surrounding area, recently it has been noted that Liu Bocheng's troops have a couple of columns with an attempt to cross the river and assist the Communist army in Yimeng Mountain area. The National Army has been prepared for it.

(Our Baoding Dispatch, 30th) The war situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has turned to a favorable situation for the National Army. The north and south National Army echo each other and adopt an encircling posture. The conservative army has begun to counterattack north along the railway last night and captured Caohe. Most of the Communist army in the suburbs of Baoding has gradually retreated, and some of the main force has moved west to Mancheng, Xushui, and Wanxian. The National Army is taking the opportunity to extend its offensive outwards, and many strongholds in the northeastern suburbs have been recovered. Morale is high, and prices in the city have also recovered. In addition, the Communist army that invaded Rongcheng has been repelled.

(Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th) Sun Lianzhong, Director of the Baosui Office, went to Zhuoxian yesterday to supervise the troops and returned to Beiping on the 30th. It is also learned that the Baoding Airport cannot yet land planes due to damaged artillery roads. The National Army's deployment is ready and can begin the counteroffensive. The two armies are still facing each other near Beihedian today. Last night, the railway south of Zhuoxian and near Nangangbian was damaged, and the southward army is still stopped at Changxindian. In addition, after the Communist army occupied Xushui and Gucheng, they launched a fierce attack on Bingshui and Yixian, and are currently fighting fiercely with the garrison. The troops in Ding and Yi are also under siege by more than fifty Communist troops coming from the east and west.

### Kong Xiangxi's Remarks

Agricultural Country's Economy Will Not Collapse

(Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th) After attending the weekly memorial service at the Beiping City Party Headquarters on the morning of the 30th, Kong Xiangxi met with our reporter and said that his trip was to understand the situation in the north and handle personal matters, and also to raise funds for Yanjing University and China University. He plans to go to Tianjin for a trip and then return to Jin to visit his sister who is ill, and then return to Beijing via Beiping. He believes that although China's current economic situation is chaotic, it will not collapse, because only industrial economies can collapse, while China is an agricultural country. He also said that the most important thing at present is to stabilize the currency system and restore currency credibility. As for repeated adjustments to foreign exchange rates, it will only encourage people to hoard gold and foreign currency, making the situation more chaotic. Regarding the 500 million loan, he said that the United States has reserved this fund for China and that the United States absolutely supports the National Government. Regarding domestic political issues, he said that maintaining social order and the government's suppression of bandits are its unavoidable responsibilities. Kong attended a banquet hosted by Sun Lianzhong on the 30th and met with the ambassador at Yanjing University in the afternoon. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Li Zongren at 8:00 PM.

### Peng Xuepei Arrives in Beijing

Will Visit the Northwest in the Next Few Days

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 30th. According to what he told reporters, he has decided to visit the Northwest in the next few days, but the date of the trip has not yet been determined. This trip is a personal action and is not dispatched by the government. As for whether to go to Dihua, he will decide after arriving in Lanzhou.

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th) A reporter visited Peng Xuepei and asked if he was dispatched to investigate the Beitashan incident. Peng replied that the local authorities have investigated clearly, and there is absolutely no need to send anyone else to investigate.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) Deputy Minister of Propaganda Xu Xiaoyan returned to Beijing on the 30th. Xu departed to inspect North China for half a month before returning. The reporter interviewed him and asked about his impressions of inspecting North China. Xu said that the military situation in North China is generally stable, and the National Army is currently firmly defending its strongholds.

### U.S. Dollar Black Market Rampant in Qingdao

(Our Qingdao Dispatch, 30th) After the U.S. dollar was banned, Mayor Li Xianliang, according to the instructions of the Executive Yuan, requested that the U.S. military exchange U.S. dollars for legal tender at the official rate. Consultations with Admiral Cooke did not reach an agreement. Currently, the U.S. dollar black market in Qingdao is extremely rampant. The municipal government is again asking the Executive Yuan for instructions on how to crack down on it.

### Allocation of Seats for Representatives of Professional Groups

Legislative Yuan's Legal Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) The Legislative Yuan's Legal Committee held a meeting on the 30th, chaired by Liu Ke, to discuss the allocation of seats after the increase in the number of representatives of professional groups. Among them, the number of seats for women's organizations was originally five, but has now been increased to eight. The number of seats for educational organizations has also been increased, and the rest will be increased according to this example. Secondly, the number of seats for women in the National Assembly was discussed. The result was a decision not to make specific provisions. The above decision will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 3rd for discussion.

### Summer Office Hours; No Changes Allowed This Year

Executive Yuan Issues Order to All Agencies

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) The season is approaching summer. Last year, the agencies in the city of Nanjing set summer office hours from July 1 to August 31, that is, from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day, with the afternoon off, adopting a half-day system. This year, after the Chairman ordered that agencies not be allowed to rest in the afternoon, the Executive Yuan issued an order to all agencies on the 30th to comply with.

### Supreme Procuratorate's Wanted Order for Mao Zedong; Confirms Mao as a Traitor; Head of a Major U.S. News Agency Issues Statement

(Our Report) Yesterday, a reporter met with the head of a major U.S. news agency in this city and asked for his thoughts on the Supreme Court Procuratorate's wanted order for Mao Zedong. He replied that the effect of this move is to confirm that the Chinese Communists are enemies of the state and that Mao Zedong is a traitor. The previous equal status given to the Chinese Communists has been completely cancelled by this move, which is undoubtedly an important measure. As for the direct impact, one is that the hope of peace talks is even more dim, and the other is that military actions on both sides will become more intense. The reporter then asked if the Truman Doctrine has been implemented in China. The person replied that, as of this time, the U.S. government is only satisfying China's needs with a limited amount of military supplies, so the Truman Doctrine has not yet been implemented in China. Future developments may lead to this possibility. As far as I know, the State Department's policy toward China has not yet been finalized, and it is urgently seeking to prevent the aggression of communism in the Far East, but it does not know what method to take. In terms of economic aid to China, the hope of construction loans is not great, because the benefits of construction take time, while the situation in China is too pressing. However, emergency loans to prevent worsening inflation are very likely, but the loan must be attached with a method of supervising its use.

(Our Report) Businessman Wang Xiaolai issued his opinion on the wanted order for Mao Zedong, stating that a wanted order is more appropriate than ordering a general offensive, because ordering a general offensive does not give the Chinese Communists equal status, while a wanted order treats them as ordinary bandits.

### Chairman to Go to Beiping This Week; Zhang Fakui to Come to Shanghai from Guangdong Today and Transfer to Beijing

(Our Beiping Dispatch, 30th) Chairman Chiang will definitely come to Beiping this week and stay for about a week. In addition, the Beiping Xingyuan has not yet received instructions regarding the establishment of a summer capital in Beiping this year.

(United Press, Nanjing, 30th) According to sources close to political circles, it is expected that Chairman Chiang will fly to Beiping on the 1st. For the next two months, he will spend most of his time in the Beiping area, so that he can be more closely connected to the war situation and can show that he is very concerned about the well-being of the people of North China. However, this news has not been officially confirmed. Although Beiping will not formally become the summer capital, the Chairman will stay in Beiping for a long time, and many important government officials will definitely go there. It is believed here that the length of the Chairman's stay in North China will depend on the war situation in Beiping. According to well-informed sources, the Chairman originally planned to fly to Beiping earlier, but because the Guomindang Central Standing Committee and Central Political Committee will hold a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 30th, which will be presided over by the Chairman himself to decide national policies, he delayed his departure from Beijing.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) According to informed sources here, Zhang Fakui, Director of the Guangzhou Xingyuan, will fly from Guangzhou to Shanghai and transfer to Beijing on the 1st to meet with Chairman Chiang for instructions.

### Democratic League Discusses the Current Situation; Believes Peace Talks Are Over

(Our Report) The Democratic League has held several consecutive Central Standing Committee meetings to carefully discuss the current situation, but has not reached a conclusion. Regarding the Supreme Court's decision to issue a wanted order for Mao Zedong, it is also believed that the road to reconciliation has been cut off, and that the matter of amending the Common Program during the Political Consultative Conference to seek to reopen peace talks is now a thing of the past. The Democratic League's past mediation of peace talks was originally an action to adapt to the political situation. Today, the objective environment has changed, and the focus of work should be placed on developing League affairs.

### Tightening of Grain Administration Agencies; Will Be Further Discussed at Today's Political Affairs Meeting; Revised Draft of Inheritance Tax Law Returned to Ministry of Finance for Revision

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) At the regular meeting of the Political Affairs Conference on the 1st, the total amount of national grain collection for this year will be discussed, and the tightening of grain administration agencies will also be discussed. It is reported that the agricultural and grain agencies in some counties that collect legal tender may be abolished, and the agricultural and grain agencies in some provinces in the Northeast may be temporarily suspended.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) The revised draft of the Inheritance Tax Law has been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the Executive Yuan believes that the tax threshold of 30 million yuan is still too low and has returned the draft to the Ministry of Finance for revision.

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) In order to strengthen the promotion of taxation, the Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance held a symposium on the 30th, inviting experts and public opinion figures to attend. This was because Shanghai merchants were trying to avoid paying income tax, so the symposium was held. More than 20 people attended, including Liu Zhendong, Ma Xingye, Jian Guansan, and Chen Yaodong. Wang Fuzhou chaired the meeting. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that foreign merchants in Shanghai have paid income tax in accordance with the law, and the Chinese should not evade taxes, so it was advocated that an audit method should be adopted and handled by the Direct Tax Department.

### List of Communist Spies in Chongqing Continues to Be Released by the Garrison Headquarters

(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th) The Garrison Headquarters announced the fourth batch of Communist spies and their accomplices for whom there is evidence, including eight students from the Rural Construction College and one student from the Central Industrial School. The Rural Construction College is run by Liang Shuming.

### In Coordination with the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, U.S. States Amend Laws; Stipulating That Foreigners Have the Right to Purchase Real Estate

(U.S. Information Service, New York, 29th) According to the "Far Eastern Survey" biweekly bulletin of the Pacific Society: The states of Nevada and Oregon have amended their laws on land ownership by foreigners in order to implement the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation. The treaty was signed in Nanjing last December and has been approved by the Chinese Executive Yuan, but the U.S. Senate has not taken action on it. It stipulates that the people and organizations of each state in the United States should recognize the land rights of Chinese people within that state, otherwise the people and organizations of that state will not be allowed to purchase real estate in China. In the remaining forty-six states, thirty states have already stipulated that foreigners have equal rights to purchase real estate in those states, so there is no conflict with this provision of the Sino-U.S. treaty.

### Howard's Remarks: The Crisis in China is Serious

(Central News Agency, San Francisco, 29th, United Press) Howard, publisher of the Scripps-Howard chain of nineteen newspapers, said here today that the civil war in China is the most serious crisis in the world, and clumsy policy has made it even worse. Howard said that the crisis in China will become more serious in the next six months, and he expressed doubt whether U.S. intervention can resolve the crisis in China. He said that the U.S. continues to misjudge the situation in China and pursue its foolish policy of mediation, and wants to create a miracle of reconciling communism and democracy, which are incompatible like water and oil. This matter cannot succeed in China, just as it cannot succeed in any region of the world. Howard was one of the reporters participating in Pan American Airways' first round-the-world flight. They left New York on the 17th of this month and flew a total of 19,000 miles, passing through Newfoundland, England, Turkey, India, Siam, the Philippines, China, Japan, Guam, Wake Island, Midway Island, and Hawaii. He arrived here today from Honolulu. Howard also said that during this trip, the reporters all believed that it was necessary for us to implement the Hoover Aid Plan and provide aid to the areas most in need. The people in all the places we passed through are asking for support, but they don't know that the U.S. warehouses also have a bottom. Conham, editor of the Boston Christian Science Monitor, also said that the world is not yet one family, and there are still worrying situations and serious problems in the international community, but in any case, some progress has been made. We have found that democracy may become a doctrine of external infusion, just like other philosophies. Today, a delegation of San Francisco civil officials, led by Acting Mayor Ke Hui, went to the airport to welcome the reporters. After a brief introduction, the reporters will go to several welcome receptions specially set up for them. The American-made Constellation aircraft in which they made the round-the-world flight is scheduled to leave here for Chicago at 1:30 AM on the 30th, and then transfer to New York.

### Dutch Delegation Arrives in Beijing; Civil Aviation Agreement Negotiations to Begin Soon

(Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th) Negotiations on the Sino-Dutch Civil Aviation Agreement will begin soon in Beijing. The head of the Dutch delegation, Dusen, Sibon, Demina, Links, Xu'er, and five others, arrived in Beijing by special plane at 12:15 PM on the 30th. The Ministry of Communications sent Director Dai Anguo of the Civil Aviation Administration and advisor Ling Shifen to be responsible for liaison with them. According to Ling, this agreement will be similar in content to the agreements with the United States and the United Kingdom, with the only difference being the air routes listed in the annex. In addition, the purpose of increasing the Sino-Dutch Airlines routes is to benefit overseas Chinese, and to add routes to the Dutch East Indies and other places. The delegation is scheduled to stay in Beijing for ten days, and will leave after deciding on the basic principles. The delegation is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Wang on the 1st.

### Chairman Chiang Cables Congratulations on Canada's National Day

The original telegram is as follows: "To His Excellency Governor General of Canada, Field Marshal Alexander: On the occasion of the Dominion of Canada's anniversary, I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Your Excellency's government and people, and wish your people happiness and prosperity, Chiang Kai-shek."

### Rehe Beipiao Coal Mine Repeatedly Besieged by Communist Army

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th) The Beipiao Coal Mine of the Resources Committee is located near Chaoyang, Rehe, and is often harassed by the Communist army. The mine originally had four mining plants, two of which were previously captured. The remaining Taihe and Guanshan mines have also been repeatedly besieged by the Communist army recently. The Taihe mine was again occupied by the Communist army on June 28. The Communist army is still attacking the Guanshan mine and fierce fighting is underway. In addition, the railway line from the mine to Yixian and Jinzhou, with Jinlingsi as the throat, is also under fierce fighting. All the employees of the mine are surrounded and urgently need reinforcements to rescue them.

### Xiong Shihui and Others Inspect Siping: Suburban Areas a Scene of Scorched Earth and Corpses, Except for Casualties, All Citizens Have Become Refugees

[Central News Agency, Siping, 30th] After the great victory at Siping, when the National Army joined forces, Director Xiong Shihui, along with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wang Shuming and Chief of Staff Zhao Jiajun, flew to Siping at 5:00 PM on the 30th to inspect the area and express their appreciation to the hard-working military and civilians of the entire city. The reporter accompanied them. At 5:40 PM, they arrived in the skies above Siping. Looking down at the city, the area west of the railroad was a scene of scorched earth, devoid of human presence. Smoke billowed from the vicinity of the train station, and flames blazed. They landed at 5:45 PM, where they were greeted by General Chen Mingren and Chairman Liu Handong. Director Xiong conveyed his regards and expressed sincere concern. General Chen's face was covered in stubble, his temples graying, making him almost unrecognizable. Chairman Liu, known for his stoutness, had visibly slimmed down, but both men's eyes shone brightly, their martial bearing surpassing their former selves, inspiring awe and respect. They then took a car heading westward on the railroad into the city. After traveling only a few yards, the overwhelming stench assaulted them, and the entire group covered their noses with handkerchiefs as they proceeded. Along the way, sentries waved in greeting, their joy evident in their expressions. Upon reaching the outskirts of the city, all the civilian houses were reduced to ruins. Corpses lay everywhere inside and outside the city, a truly tragic sight. As the car passed through the trenches, the corpses piled up within, numbering in the tens of thousands. Witnessing this scene, everyone felt their hair stand on end. After entering the city, they saw dozens of sturdy fortresses stretching for ten miles, all destroyed by artillery fire, a testament to the ferocity of the battle. This was evident. Continuing along Yuanbei Jiyu Li, the Siping Municipal Government, the Liaobei Provincial Government, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the China Three Banks, the Youth Center, the Power Bureau, and other locations were inspected. All the buildings were reduced to rubble, riddled with bullet holes, appearing like tiled windows. Passing by the train station, they saw mountains of soybeans burning and exploding. The cruelty and ruthlessness of the Communist army were infuriating. Half of the houses east of the railroad were reduced to ruins, with only a corner of the headquarters and the provincial chairman's office remaining somewhat intact, but all the buildings were covered in scars. Only a few civilians could be seen on Tiexi Street, their faces haggard, wandering among the rubble as if searching for something. Several dozen civilians could be seen on Tiedong Street, but their faces were all dark and gaunt, clamoring for food. The once magnificent architecture of Siping had completely vanished. Out of the 100,000 residents who once lived comfortably, aside from those who perished or fled, the rest were reduced to refugees. This was truly a great human tragedy. On the way back, they saw 200 soldiers from the Catholic Church surrendering with their hands raised, appearing very disheveled. Among them were dozens of Korean Communists who still displayed an obstinate and ugly demeanor.

General Chen Mingren's Thoughts: Grieving for the People Who Died Unnaturally

When the reporter asked General Chen Mingren for his thoughts, Chen remained silent for a long time, saying, "I have been a soldier for twenty years, and I have never fought such a hard battle, nor have I ever been subjected to so much artillery fire. I can tell the people of the whole country and the world with dozens of captured testimonies that the person commanding the Communist army's siege of Siping this time is undoubtedly an Easterner. No wonder the tactics of the attack were so brilliant, and no wonder the 100,000 artillery shells were so accurate. At the same time, all the artillerymen in the Communist army were Korean Communists, but they still lost, and they lost terribly." When the reporter inquired about the strength of the Communist army's siege, Chen said: "There were the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd divisions of the 1st Column, the 6th division of the 2nd Column, the 16th, 17th, 18th, and 37th divisions of the 3rd Column, plus two security regiments, one independent division, and one or two independent divisions from Songjiang. Except for the entire 3rd Column, which retreated, the rest were annihilated in the Battle of Siping. On the 27th, the 7th Brigade came to reinforce, but within a day, almost half of them were killed or wounded. In total, the Communist army suffered more than 50,000 casualties, while the National Army suffered around 7,000 casualties. However, the National Army originally only had six regiments, so the casualties could only be so many." Chen concluded by saying that this time, the military and civilians of the entire city cooperated seamlessly, weathering the storm together. The affection and sincerity they showed were truly a great victory for the revolutionary spirit. However, many innocent people died unnaturally, which is truly heartbreaking.

Chairman Liu Expresses His Views: Hopes to Promote the Revolutionary Spirit

The reporter then asked Chairman Liu for his opinion. Chairman Liu first said that this fierce battle was no small matter, and the survival of the Party and the country hinged on this battle. Civil officials have a duty to defend the land, and I dare not take credit, but combat must have the assistance of political forces. This time was the best test. I hope this revolutionary spirit can be carried forward and that no evil forces can hinder it. Now, out of the 100,000 solid citizens, apart from the casualties and those who have taken refuge, half of the rest are waiting to die. This is truly the most tragic event in the world. He immediately asked Director Xiong to provide emergency relief and a large amount of medicine and currency to help the military and civilians. Director Xiong immediately promised to deliver them by plane within a day. The group left Siping at 7:15 PM and returned to Shenyang.

### Graduation Ceremony for Two Classes at the Central Training Corps: Chairman Chiang Attends and Delivers Instructions, Offering "Diligent Practice" as a Parting Gift

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The graduation ceremony for the first class of the Agricultural Reclamation Personnel Training Class and the Journalism Personnel Training Class of the Central Training Corps was held at 10:00 AM today in the auditorium of the Ministry of National Defense.

After leading the ceremony, he gave an impromptu speech stating: "Agricultural reclamation and journalism are not only related to military construction, but also to national construction. To build a modern country, in addition to excellent military cadres, there must also be excellent cadres in transportation, agriculture, and industry. Reclamation work is the most important and fundamental of the five essential tasks of national construction. I have already mentioned this in the book 'China's Destiny.' I often think that being able to go to the border areas to be a reclamation worker should be the happiest thing in our lives, because reclamation directly contributes to the country and society. Comrades, from now on, you must concentrate on your work and strive for progress and development in your own work in order to achieve the goal of reclamation and agriculture. Comrades, transforming from military cadres to reclamation cadres is the most ideal national construction cadre, taking on the most important and glorious task. Comrades in the journalism class must understand the importance of their responsibilities. The only important task for journalists is to serve the soldiers, solve their difficulties in life and their spiritual suffering, and pay attention to promoting political education in the army, playing a leading role in thought. The so-called ideological leadership, in addition to theoretical leadership, especially in life and action, must lead by example, leading soldiers to gain the faith of officers and soldiers, and never just talk or write empty articles. Political work is not only theory, but more importantly, it is practice. Only through diligent practice can we succeed. This is true for both national construction and personal careers. I specifically offer the words 'diligent practice' as a parting gift, and I hope you will all strive for it." Everyone listened attentively and was greatly inspired. The ceremony ended at around 11:00 AM.

Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao and Prosecutor Xiang Zhejun have returned to China to report on their duties during this adjournment. According to Mei, upon arriving in Shanghai: The outside world feels impatient with the Far East International Tribunal's trial of war criminals because it has been delayed for so long, which is understandable. During the trial process, the breadth of the connections involved and the difficulty of collecting evidence were somewhat beyond the expectations of the judges, making the trial situation complicated. He also said that before leaving Tokyo, all the judges of the court invited all the defense lawyers of the defendants to discuss how to speed up the process, and the presiding judge also indicated that it would be completed by the end of the year, but it is not yet known whether this will be achieved. Judging from Mei's remarks and the recent slow progress of the trial, the end time and the outcome of the Japanese war criminal trial are difficult to predict. We are concerned about this major event and feel the need to express our views again.

The Far East International Military Tribunal has been in session for fourteen months, moving from the witness questioning stage to the current debate stage. Japanese war criminals such as Tojo and Doihara have hired multiple Japanese and American lawyers, all legal authorities and the best of their time, to debate the charges. They are engaging in grand rhetoric, creating extraneous issues in everything, intending to delay the time, whitewash their atrocities, and absolve the war criminals. This is as clear as day. According to news reports, on the 10th of this month, the defense lawyers formally requested the International Tribunal to suspend the court for six weeks, citing "the urgent need for time to prepare the remaining defense parts." Presiding Judge Webb and others, affected by the defense lawyers' "fatigue bombing," were already feeling tired, so the request for a break was immediately granted by the presiding judge. Obviously, the defense lawyers will take advantage of this gap to collect new defense materials to overturn the "indictment of Japanese Class A war criminals" submitted by the prosecutors of various countries. Therefore, new developments will inevitably occur in the trial after August 4th, and it is difficult for not only Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao but also Presiding Judge Webb to predict whether it can be concluded this year. As for the delay in the trial time and the gradual disappearance of political significance, whether the final outcome can achieve the results of the Nuremberg Nazi war criminal trials, I am afraid no one can predict. Like this kind of trial that is losing its purpose, British and Soviet public opinion has already expressed dissatisfaction. We have a deep understanding of the crimes of Japanese militarists and are extremely uneasy. We believe that there are several points that must be raised for discussion.

(1) The trial should not be delayed and should be concluded before the peace conference is convened. The editorial of this newspaper on June 1st demanded that the Tokyo Tribunal promptly convict Japanese war criminals and not delay. It pointed out that the extreme cunning of Tojo and Minami Jiro and the cunning and viciousness of Doihara, Matsui, and Umezu make it impossible to obtain reliable materials from the trial. Moreover, the more the time is delayed, the more beneficial it is to the war criminals. In terms of both law and fact, the long-term trial of the Far East International Tribunal is an unnecessary method and should be quickly remedied. Now, MacArthur advocates opening the peace conference and concluding a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. In order to eliminate the uneasy psychology of the Allied countries and enhance the enthusiasm of the Allied people for the peace treaty, we hope that the bright MacArthur and Presiding Judge Webb will promptly conclude the trial after the end of the court adjournment period in order to proceed with the peace conference. If the crimes of Japanese militarists cannot be announced to the world as soon as possible, any plan to tolerate Japan will be difficult to convince the Allied people.

(2) The definition of war criminals cannot be changed. On November 1st last year, the Nuremberg International Tribunal announced the verdict of 22 important Nazi war criminals, which is an important document in international law and has epoch-making academic value. The indictment pointed out that conspiracy to participate in the following behaviors is a war crime that should be hanged: (1) Crimes against peace: including planning, preparing, launching, and executing aggressive wars; (2) War crimes: violating the laws or customs of war; (3) Crimes against humanity: including assassination, massacre, enslavement, expulsion, or inhumane treatment of civilians by inhumane methods before or during wartime, or in political, religious, or racial abuse. According to this definition, which is roughly the same as the joint declaration of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France in August 1945, which determined the definition of war criminals, the Tokyo Tribunal should apply this "precedent" and promptly convict Japanese Class A war criminals. For "secondary war criminals" who violate the above-mentioned behaviors, not only should they be "purged," but also prosecutors from various countries should file public prosecutions or send them to the victimized countries for trial. Only in this way can the atrocities of Japanese militarists be completely eliminated, human justice and public reason be upheld, and the principles of international law "aggressive war is a crime" and the definition of war criminals in various countries be maintained.

(3) War criminals who invaded China should be extradited to China for trial. China is an important country that has suffered from the invasion and harm of Japanese militarists. The massacre in Nanjing, the bombing of Chongqing, and the killings in various cities and towns were inhumane. The authenticity of criminal acts cannot be determined without direct accusations from victims. Therefore, we demand the extradition of Class A war criminals such as Doihara, Umezu, Matsui, and a gang of criminals in the adverse consultant Kagesa. We make this claim without any desire for revenge, but to uphold the lofty principles of international law and the correct definition of war criminals. At the same time, in order to reduce the consumption of manpower and resources of the Tokyo Tribunal, this suggestion is also worth considering by those concerned.

War is the extension and continuation of politics. The conviction of war criminals and the determination of war crimes mark the end of the political significance of the war. When the Nuremberg Tribunal tried Nazi war criminals, US President Truman declared: The Nuremberg trial of war criminals was the greatest work of World War II and one of the biggest events of 1946. Truman's view is correct. Therefore, we say that the Tokyo trial of war criminals is one of the biggest events of 1947, and its political significance is significant. The end of the trial of war criminals is the complete end of the war, and what is won is the beginning of peace, the development of justice, and the restoration of the safety, prosperity, and development of human society.

### Soviet Government Instruction Arrives in Paris; Molotov Makes Suggestion; Soviet Union's Opinion Conflicts Sharply with that of Britain and France

[News from our paper] Paris, 30th (Broadcast): The three foreign ministers held their third meeting today. Bevin and Bidault were on one side, while Molotov was on the other. They have reached the stage of a showdown. If the Soviet Union insists that the United States must determine the scope of assistance to Europe, the meeting may break down.

[News from our paper] Paris, 30th (Broadcast): The three foreign ministers held a meeting today. According to a special correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation, the future of the meeting is bleak. The Soviet Union's attitude is stubborn and runs counter to that of Britain and France. Molotov stated that the British and French plans would infringe upon the interests of European countries.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Observers believe that today's meeting of the three foreign ministers may reach a turning point. It is reported that the one-day break on Sunday is intended to allow Bevin and Bidault ample time to study Molotov's suggestions on the aid to Europe plan. Molotov made this suggestion after receiving instructions from his government.

[United Press, Paris, 29th] The Paris meeting of the three foreign ministers, discussing Marshall's economic aid plan, almost reached a stalemate tonight because the Soviet Union refused to agree to it until the United States guaranteed that it would not have any political effects. The three foreign ministers will now hold their third meeting at 4 p.m. tomorrow.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Experts from the British, French, and Soviet delegations studied various proposals made in the two meetings of the three foreign ministers on Sunday. Molotov is still seeking instructions from Moscow. It is expected that no definite progress can be made until Molotov receives instructions from his government. Judging from the meetings of the first two days, there seems to be a distance between handling the Marshall Plan from a political standpoint. But everyone seems to be prepared to conduct non-political research on practical needs. The fear that the Soviet delegation would hinder the Marshall Plan has now been dispelled. Molotov made quite concrete suggestions at the meeting on Saturday, allowing the three delegations to jointly study the proposals made by the three countries on Sunday. According to reliable information, Molotov did ask the United States to clarify its future assistance to Europe and guarantee that the US Congress could approve such plans. However, Britain is opposed to asking the United States such questions at the current stage, believing that this will create technical errors and hinder the completion of the final goal. Another fundamental Soviet principle that has not yet been put forward at this meeting is that the plan should be based on the needs of individual countries, and these countries should be free to deal with such assistance under the sovereign integrity of the country. The Soviet Union, in a practical stance, does not oppose the study of the special state of European economic problems in principle. The hope that the three-power conference can reach a quick resolution is based on this. After studying the opinions of the three countries, the experts of the three countries can generally understand how to form a compromise to establish a European Economic Design Committee. At that time, Bevin will decide whether the proposed establishment of a mechanism is suitable for the needs of effectiveness and urgency.

[French News Agency, Paris, 29th] Regarding the meeting of the three foreign ministers for several days to discuss the aid to Europe plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall, people close to the meeting of the three foreign ministers said: Although the Paris meeting has developed to a difficult stage, the three foreign ministers may change their original decision when they meet tomorrow afternoon, that is, not to keep the situation of the meeting secret. According to the agreement, the three foreign ministers had reached an agreement not to publish the results of the meeting, but it was broken by the Soviet side. The Soviet TASS News Agency intended to publish the progress of the meeting, creating an impression that the meeting of the three foreign ministers had reached a stalemate. In any case, the hope that the meeting of the three foreign ministers can reach an agreement is very slim. The Soviet Union stands on one side, while Britain and France stand on the other. The British delegation seems extremely pessimistic about the meeting of the three foreign ministers. According to a representative: "We have reached a critical stage. Our views are very different from those of the Soviet Union. We really don't know how the meeting of the three foreign ministers will end." The French delegation is also not very optimistic. According to the attitudes of Britain and France, it is believed that Germany's needs and its production capacity must be taken into account in order to cope with the suggestions put forward by Secretary of State Marshall.

### US and Soviet Union Face Off on the European Reconstruction Issue

[United Press Paris, 29th] It is learned today that if the United States undertakes to fund the reconstruction of Europe to stem the spread of communism, the Soviet Union will apparently adopt a policy of promoting soaring prices as a means of resistance. Qualified observers here unanimously believe that, based on the interpretation of the Moscow reports, the initial Soviet action seems to be asking US Secretary of State Marshall to lay his cards on the table to ascertain how much financial support the US can provide when various corners of Europe draft aid plans, and what kind of backing Marshall has from the American people and Congress, or whether it is just empty talk. This Soviet move will be the beginning of an international poker game, requiring Marshall to put down more huge chips, with the leadership position of the US and the Soviet Union in Europe as stakes. The strength of the US government's preparation to support Marshall's proposal can be seen in the arrangements for welcoming two important government officials here. US Secretary of Commerce Harriman and Secretary of Agriculture Anderson are scheduled to arrive in Berlin on July 2nd, leading a team of experts to study the economic situation in Western Europe. Their itinerary includes the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Among these, except for the Netherlands and Belgium, there is a severe shortage of essential goods. Except for the Netherlands, all have experienced multiple political disturbances since the war, and it is expected that they will intensify in the future. The threat of communism heavily looms over Europe, and Soviet political influence has been advancing in Central and Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula.

Various Countries Dare Not Have High Hopes for the Foreign Ministers' Conference

A United Press survey of the reactions of various countries to the Paris Conference shows that these countries are watching the prospects of the conference with a cold and pessimistic attitude. Among them, the German people are quite worried about whether the Marshall Plan can have concrete results. Since the Moscow Conference ended in failure, they cannot help but express a cool attitude towards whether the Paris Conference can resolve the fundamental differences in economic issues. The Italian people are equally skeptical. It is said that the major powers have failed to find a basis for cooperation in the past, so they dare not have high hopes for this American proposal. The general public in Belgium believes that if the Paris Conference fails to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, the whole world will tend towards a major disaster. The Netherlands no longer needs food, but needs building materials, textiles, and machinery. The United Kingdom and France are extremely concerned about the Marshall Plan because they need tools to produce wheat, coal, and electricity, and also need transportation. As for the Soviet Union, according to an American reporter who has lived in Moscow for five years, the purpose of the Soviet representatives participating in the Paris Conference is nothing more than to demand what the Soviet Union has always demanded, namely German reparations and joint control of the Ruhr area. The Moscow Conference turned a deaf ear to the Soviet Union's request for $10 billion in reparations from Germany and joint control of the Ruhr industrial area by the four countries, and now they will bring up the old matter again.

### Pope Endorses Marshall Plan

[United Press Vatican City, 30th] When the Pope received the new British Ambassador to the Holy See, Mr. Berowne, today, he said: "The European reconstruction plan based on re-establishing cooperative relations with former enemies should be implemented as soon as possible. Further delays will be detrimental to both the victors and the vanquished." People here believe that the Pope's words are a complete endorsement of the Marshall Plan.

### Greek Foreign Minister to the United States

[Reuters Athens, 29th] When the United Nations Security Council discusses the report of the Balkan Investigation Committee, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris will personally lead a delegation to attend. Mr. Tsai flew to Geneva today en route to New York.

### Five Powers Fail to Reach Agreement on the Issue of International Military Personnel

[United Press Lake Success, 30th] It is learned today that the United Nations Military Staff Committee can submit to the Security Council tonight the first formal estimate of the number of future international peacekeeping vehicles. It is reported that the committee members of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union have failed to reach an agreement. It is widely believed that the United States, the United Kingdom, and China advocate that the number of international standby troops should be between one million and three million. The Soviet Union insists that it should not be too many and that the principle of strict equal distribution among countries should be maintained. France is only willing to provide one infantry division. Based on this, the international peacekeeping force will be about 70,000 people.

### US-Canada Joint Defense Prepares for Arctic Exercises

[United Press Washington, 29th] Authoritative sources in the Department of the Army recently announced that the United States and Canada will soon announce plans for joint Arctic exercises in the winter to guard against possible attacks from the Arctic region. At present, the United States and Canada are cooperating in military and diplomatic aspects, and since the establishment of the joint defense plan, the United States has sold a large amount of military supplies to Canada at low prices, including Flying Fortresses, tanks, batteries, transportation, hospitals, and other equipment. The US-Canada joint defense has the following provisions:

(1) Exchange experts to study the defense characteristics within each other's territory. (2) Study common plans to unify military equipment, organization, training, etc. (3) Mutually benefit from the use of military equipment such as land, sea, and air within each other's territory. (4) Open aviation bases, land transportation, and highway networks on the way from the United States to Alaska.

### American Progressive Citizens' Society Calls for the Formation of a New Party

[Central News Agency New York, 29th Special Dispatch] The "American Progressive Citizens' Society," established last year and blessed by Wallace, has recently requested all independent political groups in the United States to show a spirit of cooperation in the upcoming general election regarding progressive presidential candidates, and "if necessary, to call for it with a new party." If the threat of organizing a third party proposed by the "American Progressive Citizens' Society" is implemented, it will greatly reduce Truman's chances of being elected president in the coming year, as Mr. Du will therefore lose many votes from the free left.

### Italian Prime Minister's Speech Disrupted by Leftists

[United Press Venice, 29th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi gave a speech at an outdoor rally of the Catholic Democratic Party today. Left-wing Communist and Socialist masses poured into the venue and clashed with the police. One police chief, ten police officers, and many demonstrators were injured as a result. Amidst the turmoil, Mr. Jia continued his speech for half an hour, repeatedly asking the more than 9,000 people to observe order and criticizing the narrow-mindedness and intolerance of the Communist and Socialist parties. Later, because the conflict could not be stopped, the police used tear gas. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed, and the smoke blew towards the San Marco Square separated by the police where the Democratic Party members were located, and the meeting dispersed.

### President Auriol of Europe Fetes British and Soviet Foreign Ministers

[French News Agency Paris, 29th] French President Auriol hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace today for British Foreign Secretary Bevan and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Other attendees included British Ambassador to France Duff Cooper, Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov, US Ambassador to France Caffery, French Foreign Minister Bidault, and many French dignitaries.

### The US Government Must Lead the People to Eliminate Racial Discrimination and Strengthen Democracy - Truman Emphasizes This Point in His Speech

[United Press Washington, 29th] President Truman said today at the closing meeting of the 38th Annual Conference of the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" at the Lincoln Memorial: The US government must lead the elimination of racial prejudice and discrimination among the people at home to strengthen the democratic movement abroad. State governments and local governments should indeed earnestly protect civil rights, but the people of the whole country can no longer wait for the most backward states or the most stubborn societies to follow suit, but should be advocated by the federal government. There are still many people in the United States who are insulted and threatened. The conscience and judicial system of the American nation have not yet enabled every person to obtain complete freedom from fear.

The people of various countries suffering from soldiers abroad are struggling on the line of life and death. These people are of great importance to our continued pursuit of a peaceful solution to world problems and must be made to accept a free way of life. It is not easy to teach freedom to the suffering people of all countries. If we cannot prove the rigidity of democracy, these people will be easily seduced by the false security of totalitarian regimes when they are hungry and do not choose their food. The democratic movement we advocate must be very strong and sound. This depends on whether we can first govern our country and provide concrete evidence before we can achieve success. Du (Zengmenxuan proposed the following steps to improve civil rights protection: (1) The advisory committee organized by five Americans last December will definitely formulate effective and reasonable plans for the entire country to follow. (2) A bill will be submitted to Congress to enable the people of Guam and Sorma Island to obtain basic civil rights and share our ideals of freedom and autonomy. This move and all subsequent laws are sufficient to demonstrate to other countries that we trust that all mankind has the ability to build a free entity. The President also said: Representatives of freedom-loving countries on the United Nations Human Rights Commission are drafting the "International Human Rights Code." The representatives of various countries, including Mrs. Roosevelt, are all famous figures, and the code they have drafted will be a major milestone in the long journey of mankind to fight for freedom. Mrs. Roosevelt concluded her speech by saying: The stain of lynching blacks in the United States must be eradicated so that democracy can be implemented soundly. The United Nations People's Committee adheres to the principle of "all mankind are brothers" and wants to build a world "where all mankind can live as brothers," which depends on the help of the United States.

### Holy Land Investigation Team Plans to Visit Transjordan

British Troops Attacked by Jewish Terrorist Party

[French News Agency Jerusalem, 29th] Well-informed sources here recently said that the chairman of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, Swedish Judge Sandstrom, will visit Transjordan's Abdullah. At that time, he may contact him about the investigation committee's visit to the capital of Transjordan.

[United Press Jerusalem, 29th] It was officially announced that five British soldiers were sunbathing in Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv, when they were attacked by gunfire from Jewish underground members. Two officers were injured, one in the head, and two other soldiers, one seriously injured and one slightly injured. The rioters escaped under the cover of smoke bombs. Last night, four British soldiers were attacked by terrorist parties and were seriously injured and fatally wounded. This happened only eighteen hours apart. According to the terrorist party, this was in retaliation for the disappearance of a sixteen-year-old Jew named Lobowitz on May 6. The Palestinian authorities said that they had no way of finding out the whereabouts of this Jewish youth and that he was probably no longer alive.

### France Cracks Down on Coup Conspiracy Attempts to Attack Paris to Establish a Dictatorship Many Senior Military and Political Officials Arrested

[Reuters Paris, 30th] The French National Security Police announced this morning that they had uncovered a large-scale conspiracy to overthrow the French government in July and replace it with a dictatorship. Many senior military and political officials were also involved in the case, but their names were not announced. The most active areas of the conspirators were Brittany and the northern coast of Langyuan, and the investigation is about to be completed. Twelve hours before this announcement, rumors were rife in Paris that there would be shocking arrests, martial law would be declared, and a large number of cabinet members would resign. It is reported that one of the leaders of the conspirators was a retired officer, a former subordinate of Petain. In addition, six or seven French government officials were actively involved in these conspiracies. It is reported that most of their names will be announced on the same day. According to the security police, the conspirators planned to launch a coup in mid-July. The rebel army will launch a lightning attack on Paris from centers such as Rennes and Vannes to seize key points. Political prisoners such as the telephone bureau, telegraph bureau, and Fresnes prison will be released. After the rebel army enters Paris, it will establish a dictatorship and immediately implement new laws. The security police have also obtained a list of the rebel government to replace the Lamadie government. It is reported that this conspiracy was discovered after the French police searched the residence of Volban, the editor of "French Activities Weekly," on June 24 and obtained many conspiracy documents. Volban has been arrested.

[United Press Paris, 30th] The arrested suspects are all right-wing people and have nothing to do with General de Gaulle's recently organized French People's Party. According to news from the city of Brittany, those arrested include retired veterans and national leaders such as Volban. The party leader is a friend of former Marshal Petain. When the police searched a private residence in Brittany, they found many drafts of lists of foreign government personnel and decrees and regulations, usurping the name "Five Executive Cabinets." The Five Executive Cabinets were organized in accordance with the Constitution of 1795 during the French Revolution from 1795 to 1799.

[French News Agency Paris, 30th] Observers here said that the conspiracy to overthrow the government discovered by the French police may have international relations and involve first-class figures. The police authorities announced today that they have arrested General Girodaux, the former commander of the French Gendarmerie, Major Zenggen, and Father Rothe. A large number of weapons were hidden in the priest's residence. The police started searching this case six months ago and only announced it today. The cracking of this conspiracy may completely change the political situation in France, and it is expected that the case will still have major developments.

### Hiroshima Sings and Dances in Peace to Commemorate the Atomic Bomb

[French News Agency Tokyo, 30th] Hiroshima residents will hold a celebration ceremony on the second anniversary of the US bombing of Japan with the first atomic bomb, including dancing, singing, and fireworks. The celebration will last for three days, from August 5 to 7. The Mayor of Hiroshima and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce will personally ask Emperor Hirohito to attend the grand ceremony. The organizers also plan to invite American officials to participate.

### UNRRA's European Operations Were Declared Closed Yesterday Relief Supplies Worth a Total of US$300 Million

[French News Agency Washington, 29th] UNRRA Director General General Rooks declared today that all hope for the relief of war-stricken countries now rests on the economic aid plan for Europe recently proposed by US Secretary of State Marshall and the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in Paris. After the end of the war, UNRRA distributed relief supplies to war-stricken countries and will now cease operations on June 30. Since the beginning of its work, UNRRA has distributed relief supplies worth US$300 million to European countries. Speaking of the Three Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in Paris, the political differences between the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and France constitute a serious obstacle to the economic progress of the world.

[United Press Washington, 29th] The work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in Europe will end on June 30, but in the Pacific, relief will continue in China, Korea, and the Philippines to complete its plan, which is expected to take several months until late autumn. UNRRA's work has far exceeded its original budget, and the funds spent are no less than US$3.67 billion, of which US$530 million is designated for relief in China, which is the largest amount. In addition, the number in the Pacific is limited, totaling US$10.33 million for the Philippines and US$1 million for Korea. 75% of the relief plan for China has been completed, and the materials that have been shipped or are ready to be shipped account for about 83%. There are still more than 17% of the funds available.

### General Strike in Uruguay

[Reuters Montevideo, 30th] Fifty-three trade union organizations in Uruguay have ordered their workers to implement a 24-hour general strike on Monday in protest against the recently passed anti-strike law. Emergency services will be maintained at that time, and the authorities have taken precautionary measures throughout the country upon receiving the news.

### Dutch Governor Reaffirms Policy to Promote the Establishment of the East Indies Federation Sokarno Appoints Shari as Advisor

[Our report] London 30th Broadcast: The Indonesian military announced today that in the past two days, the Dutch army has been constantly shelling the positions of the Indonesian army 25 miles west of Surabaya. Also on June 25, the two armies exchanged fire for five hours.

[United Press Batavia, 30th] Dutch East Indies Governor Van Mook declared today that the Dutch government has clarified its policy towards the East Indies, with the aim of establishing the East Indies Federation and making it an independent country. Van Mook said at a press conference that the Netherlands believes that the Dutch proposal of May 27 is a "reasonable and possible solution to the Indonesian problem and facilitates the rapid and effective construction of a new country." He regretted that the final reply from Indonesia did not address several key points, including the future diplomatic relations of Indonesia. Van Mook also expressed his regret for the resignation of Indonesian Prime Minister Shari, who had "completed a very good task in the past," and he admitted that Mr. Sha's resignation "makes the event seem to be in a deadlock." Van Mook also said that the American note submitted by US Consul Fuder to Indonesian Education Minister Su Hongdi was a "timely and helpful" move, especially since this note was proposed by an important government of a third country. The American note strongly advocated a quick solution and allowed for economic assistance to the Dutch East Indies, "which is in line with the outline of our policy." Regarding Eastern Indonesia and Western Borneo, Van said: "We cannot avoid responsibility for these areas or avoid responsibility for the people living in the Republican government area who hope to compromise." He avoided answering whether the American note contained a time limit for reply. When asked if the situation would be more relaxed if Shari returned to office, he replied: It depends on what circumstances he returns to office. At the same time, the Dutch Anida News Agency said that President Sokarno has appointed Shari in Yogyakarta as a presidential advisor. Sokarno also sent letters to the leaders of the four major political parties, requesting them to organize a new cabinet at 6 pm on Tuesday. The letter was sent to Social Party leader Sharifuddin and Dr. Gani of the Nationalist Party, both of whom were cabinet members of the previous Shari cabinet. The other two party leaders are Dr. Masjumi (Muslim) and Dr. Setijito of the Labor Party. According to Indonesian sources, Sharifuddin is likely to be the new prime minister. Republican officials in Batavia told the Dutch news agency that Shari's appointment as presidential advisor shows that the president fully trusts Mr. Sha's policies and is willing to see them implemented.

[United Press Yogyakarta, 30th] Indonesian Republic President Sukarno issued a statement today calling on the four major political parties in the country to organize a joint cabinet by tomorrow night to cope with the current emergency situation. At the same time, Indonesian leaders continued to consider the American note. Some people expressed concern about the original text of the note, believing that it was very different from the telegram received yesterday, which stated: "The United States believes that it is urgently needed to establish an Indonesian provisional central government immediately based on the federal foundation proposed by the Dutch government and accepted in principle by the Indonesian Republic." However, the words "Dutch government" and "accepted in principle" were omitted from the telegram, becoming "based on the federal foundation proposed by the Indonesian Republic," which completely changed the meaning.

### North Korean Conference Opens

Soviet Representative Accuses Reactionaries

[New Asia Agency Seoul, 30th] The joint meeting of the US-Soviet Joint Committee and the North Korean democratic political parties and social organizations was held at 2 pm on the 30th in the conference hall of the North Korean People's Committee. The flags of Korea and the Soviet Union were hung high in front of the venue. At 1:50 pm, Kim Doo-bong, Chairman of the People's Committee, arrived at the venue. At 2 pm, General Kim Il-sung, the supreme leader of North Korea, entered the venue, followed by General Morotkov, commander of the Soviet stationed army, and representatives from the US and Soviet sides. Morotkov said in his speech: "The Korean people have been under Japanese rule for more than 40 years. We should not only relieve their suffering, but also make them truly free and liberated." US representative Major General Brown said: "My expectations for the people of North Korea are higher than those for the people of South Korea. I believe that through the efforts of the gentlemen in North Korea, all problems can be expected to be resolved." Soviet representative Shitikov said: "Now some reactionaries are hindering the establishment of a provisional government, but the absolute majority of the people are looking forward to the establishment of a provisional government and hope to receive assistance from the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom."

### US Engineers to Study Reparations Issue

Completing the Entire Project Will Take Two Years

[United Press Tokyo, 30th] An independent US engineering survey committee is expected to arrive in Tokyo this month to conduct a "final" investigation of Japan's reparations issue. The committee includes private businessmen and technicians, and may also include members of the Schuler Committee, which inspected Japanese industry in February. Although the committee only has the right to make recommendations and no other powers, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces still strongly hopes to have the views of an independent group before dealing with 30% of the temporary compensation. According to well-informed sources, the committee will focus on the future of Japanese industry and, at the request of the Allied Headquarters, study the factories that should be used for reparations. Delegations from China, the Philippines, and other countries are extremely impatient to wait for compensation. The entire compensation plan will take about two years to complete.

### The Opposition Launches a Full-Scale Offensive: The Katayama Cabinet Faces a Test; Shigeru Yoshida to Grill on Anti-Communism

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The first session of the Japanese Diet will formally enter the deliberation stage on July 1st. After Prime Minister Katayama's policy speech, the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, Wada, will explain the emergency economic countermeasures, replacing the usual Minister of Finance's address, and a white paper will be used to explain the essence of the crisis. On July 2nd, each party will begin questioning the Prime Minister's speech, with the President of the Liberal Party, Shigeru Yoshida, the Socialist Party's Kanju Kato, the Democratic Party's Tokutaro Kitamura, the People's Cooperative Party's Kyoji Funada, the Farmers' Party's Masaoki Tsunashima, and the Communist Party's Kyuichi Tokuda taking the lead. According to well-informed sources, Yoshida will engage in hand-to-hand combat with the Social Democratic parties, directly raising anti-communist questions in an attempt to demonstrate the power of the opposition party. Kato, as a central figure of the Socialist Party's left wing, is expected to present his questions from the standpoint of a left-wing representative. Kitamura Tokutaro will raise questions about the state management of coal mines, and the government's response will affect the unity of the ruling parties. On the questioning session of July 3rd, the Chairman of the Liberal Party's General Affairs Committee, Jiro Hoshijima, is expected to raise questions on coal trade issues, among others. Finally, the Communist Party representative, Kyuichi Tokuda, will also use a unique strategy, from the pure standpoint of the opposition party, to challenge the Katayama cabinet as an anti-communist regime.

Coal Mine Nationalization Issue Causes Intense Party Disputes

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The biggest difficulty for the Katayama Cabinet in the Diet lies in the Liberal Party's all-out attack, but there are also some disagreements between the government and the ruling parties on some minor issues. For example, regarding the coal mine issue, the Socialist Party advocates state management with nationalization as a premise, while the Democratic Party advocates state management with private ownership as a premise, and believes that state management is predicated on increased production. If there is no concrete assurance of increased production, state management should not be implemented immediately. If the resolution of this issue is flawed, it will create rifts in the three-party coalition cabinet.

[Reuters, Budapest, 29th] As the approval period of the Hungarian peace treaty and the withdrawal period of the Soviet troops gradually approach, the Soviet Union's acquisition of economic control in Hungary has also intensified.

### British Tram Halts for Half a Day - All Workers Take Leave to Request Improved Welfare

[Our Newspaper] Employees of the British Tram Company took a general half-day leave yesterday to demand job security and improved worker welfare. Tramcars and trolleybuses on all routes did not leave the depot. At 8:00 AM, more than 700 people gathered to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, making six demands. After the Social Affairs Bureau responded, all employees resumed work at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and tramcars on all routes resumed service. The crux of this disturbance lies in the issue of job security. As early as August 27th of last year, the union requested that the company, in cases of ticket loss, machinery [blank space] accidents, or negligence, should provide subsidies as usual, in accordance with the French Tram Company's methods, to maintain the livelihoods of families. Negotiations have been delayed and have not yet been resolved. On May 26th of this year, tramcar No. 838 on the eighth route ran over a pedestrian on Daming Road. The driver was detained by the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. More than a month has passed, and he has not yet been released. His family of four has no means of survival, and negotiations with the company have been rejected, arousing the righteous indignation of the employees, who finally decided to hold a march and petition at an emergency meeting convened on an ad hoc basis.

Petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau

At 8:00 AM yesterday, more than 700 people gathered at the tram depot on Hardoon Road, led by the national flag and the union flag, and set off to march and petition. The procession proceeded from Hardoon Road via Bubbling Well Road, Tongfu Road, and Avenue Joffre to the Social Affairs Bureau. The Jiangning Branch dispatched 60 police officers and two red emergency vehicles and jeeps to maintain order and provide dissuasion. The petitioning team was dispersed twice along the way, but continued to advance. At around 10:00 AM, the team entered the plaza of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the accompanying red emergency vehicle also attempted to enter, but was prevented by employees lying on the ground. After the main body entered the Social Affairs Bureau, they posted slogans all around and appointed representatives Xu Shijian and others to meet with Fan Zhenbang, the Mediation Section Chief of the Labor Affairs Division.

Six Demands Presented

Representative Xu and others presented six demands: (1) For outdoor personnel who cause accidents on duty, wages should be paid as usual during the detention period. (2) Labor's Children school should be established as soon as possible. (3) Employees should be provided with boots needed for work. (4) The employer should be ordered to follow the special leave and bereavement leave methods stipulated by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee. (5) The employer should be ordered to allocate kerosene on a regular basis. (6) Returning employees should have their original salaries and seniority restored. Section Chief Fan considered the first demand reasonable and promised that the Social Affairs Bureau would negotiate with the company. Points two, three, and five were welfare issues and promised to convene labor-management discussions. The fourth point was a legal issue and would be supervised by the Evaluation Committee for implementation. The sixth point could not be discussed because these were all people who had been dismissed during the occupation by the Japanese, due to illness, fraud, or other negligence. After the victory, the Social Affairs Bureau found ways to restore their work with the treatment of new workers. Because they had an employment relationship with the enemy, past seniority was not counted.

### Another Case of Smuggling Yun Soil by Air - Drug Dealers Arrested at Hongqiao Airport - Five Accomplices Also Apprehended

[Our Newspaper] At 6:00 PM on the 28th of last month, the Police Bureau's Detective Section arrested Zhang Dongchen (also known as Liu Wenhua), a drug dealer who had arrived in Shanghai from Kunming on a China National Aviation Corporation transport plane. Thirty-five taels of pure Yun soil were seized from his travel bag on the spot. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, five accomplices and suspects, Zi Ming (31 years old, from Fujian, graduated from the 5th class of the Air Force), Liu Shende, Xu Shilong, Liu Weimin, and Ling Yu氏, were arrested at No. 35, Jiufu Lane, Jiangyin Road, No. 6, Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road, and No. 9, Yukang Lane, Shouning Road. According to Zhang's confession, he is 35 years old and from Kunming.

He is a cloth merchant. In February of this year, he met Wang Ziming, a retired Air Force officer, through a friend in Kunming. They hit it off, and talked about the high price of "soil" in Shanghai. If they could find a way to smuggle it to Shanghai by air, they could make a huge profit. Because Wang was from the Air Force, he immediately promised to find a plane seat. So, the two of them jointly invested 600,000 yuan, and bought twenty taels of opium at a price of 30,000 yuan per tael from Yang Shenzhi at No. 15, Minsheng Lane, outside the South Gate of Kunming.

They tried smuggling it, and the result was quite successful. After arriving in Shanghai, Zhang stayed at the Dahu Hotel on Zhongzheng Road, and Wang stayed at his friend's house at No. 35, Jiufu Lane, Jiangyin Road. Later, they were introduced to Xu Shilong, and then Xu introduced them to Zhang Lin氏, a woman, to whom they sold the opium for 80,000 yuan per tael, earning 1.6 million yuan. The two of them split the money equally. In April of this year, Zhang went to Kunming alone to smuggle once. On the 16th of last month,

They cooperated again. Zhang flew to Kunming and bought forty taels of opium (35 taels net weight), and when he arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 28th, he was discovered by F俊厚, the chief of the Detective Section of the Police Bureau, who dispatched Feng Qishan, Zhang Changgui and other staff to wait at Hongqiao Airport to apprehend him. The investigation of all the perpetrators has now been completed, and they will be transferred to the District Court for interrogation today.

### Overseas Soviet Citizens in Shanghai Granted Permission to Return to Their Country - Provided with Travel Expenses, Employment Assistance, and Various Conveniences

[Our Newspaper] The Russian-language newspaper in this city issued an extra edition at noon yesterday, carrying a notice from the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai stating that the Soviet government has decided to allow 3,000 overseas Soviet citizens in Shanghai and their families to return to their homeland within this year. All Soviet citizens returning to their country will immediately be given employment by the government according to their respective identities, provided with housing, food, and other necessities. Poor overseas citizens can also be granted loans to enable them to start a livelihood. All return expenses will be borne by the government, and the luggage and personal belongings of overseas citizens will be exempt from customs inspection upon entering the country. After learning of this news, Soviet citizens in this city held a grand gathering at the Soviet Overseas Chinese Association on Pershing Road at 8:00 PM last night to celebrate. According to the Russian-language newspaper, most Soviet citizens will take this opportunity to return to their country. According to the household registration statistics of the Police Bureau in this city, there are more than 7,000 Soviet citizens in the city. Now that the Soviet government has allowed 3,000 overseas citizens and their families to return to their country, it is tantamount to enabling all Soviet citizens in Shanghai to return to their country. In addition, the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai also announced yesterday that it will allow 150 White Russian orphans in Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin to be sent back to the Soviet Union within this year.

### Dyeing Factory Owner Tragically Shot Dead - First Interrogation of Gu Weijun - Defendant Denies Firing Gun, Claims Accidental Discharge - Prosecutor Ding to Inspect Scene of Incident This Morning

[Our Newspaper] At 0:30 AM on June 24th, a dispute occurred in front of the Hongqiao Grand Theater, followed by Gu Weijun, a volunteer policeman from the Xujiahui District, going to the home of Wang Wanshun, the old shopkeeper of the Shunxing Dyeing Factory (currently the director of the Hand-made Cotton Weaving Industry Union), and shooting Wang, injuring him. He was sent to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment, but died on the 28th due to excessive blood loss. The family of the victim filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office accusing the volunteer policeman of homicide. The defendant was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office by the police bureau for investigation. Wang was from Anhui. Yang Hu, Chairman of the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, and Fang Zhi, Director of the Municipal Party Department, sent official letters to the District Prosecutor's Office, stating that Gu's arbitrary shooting and killing was extremely illegal. In addition to Wang Zhenxiong, the son of the victim, publishing a statement in the newspaper to clarify the truth, they requested the court to handle the case strictly in accordance with the law. Prosecutor Ding Tongjun conducted the first interrogation of the case yesterday. In addition to questioning the defendant Gu Weijun, he also summoned Wang Zhenxiong, the son of the victim, and Zheng Zixin, Xu Shanggao, Sun Daonan, Sun Yougao and other employees of the factory who witnessed Gu shooting. According to the plaintiff's side, on the night of the 23rd, policemen from the Xujiahui Police Station knocked on the door, accusing Zheng Zhenxiong of causing trouble at the Hongqiao Grand Theater, and slapped him in the face. His father, Wang Wanshun, came to his rescue and argued with them. Unexpectedly, the policeman [blank space] fired a pistol, and the bullet entered Wang Wanshun's abdomen, fatally injuring him. The defendant Gu Weijun denied firing the gun, claiming that the pistol was accidentally discharged, and that the shooter was another policeman. Prosecutor Ding, believing that the defendant was highly suspected of committing a crime, ordered him to be detained. The witnesses were ordered to return. He scheduled to go to the scene of the incident this morning for inspection, and to summon the director of the Xujiahui Branch and other policemen who went to Wang's house with Gu at the same time, in order to clarify the truth.

### Cathay Theater Shareholders Meeting Fails

[Our Newspaper] The Cathay Theater is operated by Lianyi Company. On the 28th of last month, the company held a shareholders' meeting. When the chairman reported on the accounts, the fees for accountants and lawyers reached a huge amount of more than US$21,000, which aroused inquiries from the shareholders. After checking the accounts, it was found that the lawyer's fees of more than US$18,000 were part of the expenses personally spent by He Tingran (who arbitrarily served as the managing director of the China United Film Company during the enemy and puppet period, and was reported by others after the victory). The shareholders believed that He was using public funds for private purposes and insisted on not approving it, so the shareholders' meeting was declared adjourned. It is said that the company's stock has a face value of US$30, but last year each share only received 6,700 yuan in national currency, which led to the dispute.

### Punishing War Criminals is Not Revenge - Ministry of National Defense Telegraphed to Military Tribunals Prohibiting Parade Before Execution - Rumor of Li Liang's Removal is Untrue

[Our Newspaper] When the Japanese war criminals "Wolf of Changshu" Mura Haruki and "Tiger of Jiangyin" Shimoda Jiro were executed on the 17th of this month, the military tribunal paraded the two criminals through the streets before the execution, causing a sensation throughout the city. It was rumored that the authorities were deeply dissatisfied with this "wolf and tiger parade" because it was attacked by foreign newspapers, so they removed the head of the tribunal, Li Liang, and appointed Shi Meiyu, the head of the Nanjing Military Tribunal, to replace him, scheduled to take over today. It is now learned that the rumor of the removal is untrue. Since Li Liang has been the head of the military tribunal, he has carried out the trial of war criminals in a difficult situation of tight funding, and his achievements have been outstanding. He is still holding the position as usual. However, recently, the Ministry of National Defense, considering that the purpose of punishing war criminals is to maintain humanitarian justice and protect the dignity of international law, and not to implement revenge, has indeed telegraphed all military tribunals across the country, prohibiting the parade of war criminals before execution and prohibiting the use of retaliatory words and sentences in official documents, such as inappropriate measures such as "to satisfy the people's hearts".

[Our Newspaper] Zhou Shengchang, 18 years old, unemployed, from Haimen, is temporarily residing with relatives at No. 3, Lane 199, Jinan Road, who run a rickshaw repair shop. On the 29th, he picked up a rusty butcher knife, about a foot long, near his residence, and took it to the Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop at No. 345, Shunchang Road to sharpen it. He hid it on his person, and went out for a stroll on the street after dinner that day. At around 3:00 AM the next morning, he suddenly encountered rickshaw puller Zhang Susheng (23 years old, from Nantong, residing at No. 48, Lanxin Lane, Ximen Road) at the intersection of Ximen Road and Jinan Road. Zhou immediately hired the rickshaw, stating that he would pay 11,000 yuan to go to Hefei Road. After arriving at the entrance of No. 568 on that road, Zhou suddenly pulled out the butcher knife and stabbed Zhang twice in the back, penetrating his chest.

Dai Yifu, a police officer from the Sige Police Station in the nearby alley, heard the sound and rushed to the scene, immediately arresting Zhou and taking him to the Songshan Police Station. After receiving the report, Shen Zuoluo, the chief of the Criminal Division of the bureau, personally led the officers to investigate.

### Shameless Woman Buried with Husband Under the Knife

### Central Government Revises Method for Recovering Land Purchased by Enemy and Puppet Regimes - Compensation Based on Percentage and Estimated Value

[Our Newspaper] Private land purchased or acquired by enemy and puppet regimes in various occupied areas may be repurchased by the original landowners after the victory, unless the government has a definite need to use it legally. The method of repurchase is in accordance with Article 6 of the Regulations for Clearing Land Rights in Recovered Areas, where the owners present valid documents to reclaim the land by paying back the price received at the time of collection based on the current price index. Later, the Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal Bureau requested and was approved by the central government to not calculate based on the price index, but to reclaim the land based on the gold price ratio. Recently, the central government has made another revision to this. The municipal government has received instructions from the Executive Yuan that when the land acquired by the enemy is approved to be reclaimed by the original owner, it should be re-estimated at the market price, that is, the percentage of the value of the property occupied by the price received by the owner at that time should be calculated, and then the amount payable should be calculated based on the estimated value of the property at the present time, using the occupied percentage. For example, if a plot of land was valued at 200,000 yuan at the time, and the enemy only paid 50,000 yuan for the purchase, accounting for 25 percent. If the land is now valued at 200 million yuan, the landowner should pay 50 million yuan, calculated at 25 percent, in order to reclaim the land.

### Reader Consultation - Legal Interpretation

(1) Analysis of Family Property

Su Xingwu asks: A certain gentleman passed away in the 6th year of the Republic of China, leaving behind his wife and three children, A, B, and C. Later, the eldest son, A, married Bing and had a son. Two years later, A and his son passed away one after another. Since A's death, there has been discord between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Bing, knowing that it is difficult to stay for long, proposes to request an analysis of the family property. However, Bing is a weak woman and does not understand legal procedures, so please give your lawyer instructions, which would be most fortunate.

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] Upon investigation, the deceased passed away before the implementation of the inheritance section of the current Civil Code. According to the old law, a widow who maintains her chastity, in addition to enjoying her own property, has no right of inheritance to her husband's estate, let alone the right to inherit the estate on behalf of her husband or his deceased son.

(2) Disturbing the Peace

Ge Shouyu asks: A friend of mine runs a rice mill with a 24-horsepower engine. It starts work every morning at 9:00 AM and stops at 6:00 PM in the evening. The machine vibrates slightly when it is running. After several reforms, it has been greatly improved. There are several legal questions, please answer: (1) If a neighbor believes that my friend is disturbing the peace, is my friend guilty? (2) Does my friend have an obligation to provide housing insurance for the neighbor? (3) If a neighbor prevents a friend from working, and my friend ignores it, is it illegal?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] (1) If the area is not restricted from setting up factories and the engine vibration is minimal during daytime work, there is no criminal offense. (2) There is no obligation to provide insurance, but if the vibration of the engine causes damage to the neighbor's house, then he is liable for compensation. (3) It is not illegal.

### The National Central Library Actively Handles International Exchange of Publications

International Cultural Exchanges Have Become Increasingly Prosperous in the Past Six Months, Opening Up a Hub for East Asia to Communicate with International Culture

To communicate international academics and establish cultural construction, the mutual exchange of publications between countries is an urgent task. Since the Executive Yuan approved the National Central Library's Regulations on Handling International Exchange of Publications on January 29, 1936, and the Executive Yuan circulated it for implementation on April 19 of the same year, the work of exchanging publications has gradually unfolded, and international cultural exchanges have become increasingly prosperous. The work situation in the first half of 1936 is summarized below:

(1) Import and Distribution of Foreign Publications: All agencies representing foreign governments in handling the exchange of publications have submitted applications to restore exchange relations, totaling 63 units. Among them, 26 countries, including Belgium, the United States, Italy, Portugal, and China, formally participated in the 1886 Brussels Exchange Convention. 23 countries, including Mexico, Cuba, and Russia, informally participated in the above-mentioned exchange convention. Other countries that have not participated in the above-mentioned exchange convention, such as the United Kingdom and Denmark, have also been contacted to establish exchange relations in order to universally remove international cultural barriers. A total of 206 boxes and 55 packages of books were received from the exchange offices of the United States, Denmark, West Germany, and Sweden in the first half of the year. Except for the 23 boxes recently arrived from the United States, the rest were transported or mailed according to the documents from the exchange offices and the addresses of the receiving agencies or recipients (totaling 328 units) listed on the packages. As of the end of June, a total of 133 boxes were transported in full, and 1,601 packages were collected and mailed by piece. 505 packages still need to be sorted and mailed. In addition, a large number of books sent to our country by exchange offices in Brazil, Switzerland, South Australia, the Netherlands, and Egypt are reported to be in transit.

(2) Collection and Distribution of Domestic Publications: All government agencies and academic groups at all levels in China have been contacted to send publications, and 5,000 copies of the exchange regulations approved by the Executive Yuan have been printed and distributed to various agencies, schools, and social groups for reference. Although some have not been able to send books and periodicals in a timely manner due to the unfinished restoration or financial difficulties, a total of 132 types and 3,288 volumes of books legally sent were still received in the first half of the year, totaling 588 types and 7,151 volumes including special books. 369 types and 1,259 copies of legally sent regular publications were received. Government agencies accounted for 299 units that sent the above publications, and educational, cultural, and academic groups accounted for 101 units. Geographically, the number of agencies in remote provinces that sent publications was only one-fifth of the total. After the publications arrive and are registered, they are sorted and shelved according to the exchange units of various countries and the nature of our country's publications they need. In addition to packages being mailed to various countries on time, those that need to be shipped abroad are done at least once every two months. As of the end of June, a total of 30 boxes of publications were transported abroad (including 8 boxes that are being negotiated with the Customs and the Central Bank). 727 packages were mailed abroad. By country, 24 boxes were shipped to the United States, 3 boxes to the United Kingdom, 1 box to Australia, and 2 boxes to the Soviet Union.

(3) Development of Exchange Work: (1) Special application matters from domestic and foreign government agencies and academic groups are handled separately. Domestically, the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Historical Materials Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Finance, and the Zhejiang Provincial Bank have all negotiated with relevant foreign agencies through the exchange office to exchange books and periodicals of the same nature. There are more letters from abroad requesting. The important ones include the US State Department requesting donations of Chinese government reports, statistics, and publications such as university journals and research reports, and donating the full set from the Victory Fukan issue. Part of it has been handed over to the US Academic Office for air transportation to Washington, DC. As a result, two sets of Chinese official books will be collected in the United States (the other set is collected by the US Library of Congress). The Central Bureau of Statistics of Batavia requested donations of books and periodicals related to statistics and socioeconomics. The Ferenc Hopp Museum of Eastern Asiatic Arts in Hungary suffered heavy damage in this war, and specially sent a letter requesting donations of Chinese art magazines, art dictionaries, art history, as well as Anyang excavation reports and Anyang cultural relic catalogs, all of which are handled separately. (2) Establish exchange relationships with famous university libraries abroad, such as Columbia University, Harvard Yenching Institute, University of Hawaii, and San Marcos University in Peru, all of which have begun to exchange books and periodicals with the Chinese Exchange Office. In addition, a copy of the Siku Zhenben was donated to the University of Western Australia, and the Collection of Late Qing Poetry and the Pingjin Museum Series were purchased and donated to the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Recently, a letter was received from Professor Stephen Gáll, who learned that the Chinese College of the University of Budapest was destroyed in this war. For the sake of restoration, China should provide assistance.

(4) Translation and Compilation of New Book Catalogs and Book Abstracts: (1) In order to make it convenient for foreign academic institutions and individual scholars to understand the Chinese publication situation and select and purchase or exchange Chinese books, a new book catalog has been translated and compiled, which is divided into two parts: books and periodicals. After the translated names, English annotations, publication year, publication place, publisher, price, etc. are attached, and published quarterly in the English journal "Book Forest Quarterly" published by the National Central Library. The publication of this journal for less than a year has made a great contribution to international academic circles. In addition to sending letters requesting exchanges and subscriptions, Professor Stephen Gáll specially reported to the Hungarian News and Hungarian Radio to promote it. (2) Chinese publications are often inconvenient for foreign scholars due to the difficulty of the text. The Birmingham Public Library, the Oxford University Library, the Oxford University Botanical Garden Library, and the Royal Entomological Society of London have all requested that a copy of the English abstract be attached when sending publications to make it easier to understand.

As mentioned above, the National Central Library's International Exchange Office for Publications represents the government in handling the exchange of publications and will become one of the hubs for East Asia to communicate with international culture. However, due to insufficient funding, it has not been able to fully develop.

Under the control of the Central Bank, the exchange rate has been effectively stabilized, but the situation in South China is still special, and the rise in the domestic exchange rate has become even more severe recently. The exchange rate for commercial banks once exceeded 5 per thousand, reaching a peak of 280 yuan. The exchange rate in Guangzhou and other places has already been raised by national banks to a record of 95 yuan and cannot be increased any further. The biggest reason for this exchange rate fluctuation is still smuggling and capital flight to Hong Kong. Because the official exchange rate differs too much from the exchange rate for commercial banks, an arbitrage phenomenon has occurred. For example, if 10 million yuan is remitted from a national bank to South China, a profit of 1 million yuan can be made. In view of this, the Central Bank has stipulated starting yesterday (30th) that the amount of money remitted by each commercial bank to the provinces of Guangzhou and Fujian is limited to 50 million per week. Remittances can be made in installments or in one lump sum, but any amount exceeding 50 million will be rejected. At the same time, national banks are also tightening commercial remittances. The Bank of China has stopped ordinary commercial remittances yesterday (30th), limiting remittances for living expenses to a maximum of 2 million yuan. These measures by the national banks are all to prevent capital flight and arbitrage by unscrupulous merchants. When the situation improves, the normal practices will be restored.

In addition, the exchange rates for remittances from national banks to various regions have been revised. The rate for the Guangdong area is all 95 yuan. The rate for Xiamen in the Fujian area has been increased from 80 yuan to 95 yuan, and the rate for Fuzhou has been increased from 50 yuan to 80 yuan. The rate for the Guangxi area has been increased from 60 yuan to 80 yuan. The rate for Changsha and Hengyang in the Hunan area has been increased from 40 yuan to 45 yuan. The rate for Lianyungang, Xinpu, and Dongtai in the Jiangsu area has been increased from 20 yuan to 25 yuan. The rate for Hankou and Wuchang in the Hubei area has been increased from 35 yuan to 40 yuan. The rate for Shashi, Yichang, and other places has been increased from 40 yuan to 45 yuan per thousand. The rate for Qingdao in the Shandong area has been increased from 5 yuan to 20 yuan, and the rate for other places has been increased from 5 yuan to 10 yuan. The rate for other places has been decreased from 30 yuan to 20 yuan. The rate for the Shaanxi area has been decreased from 10 yuan to 5 yuan. All other rates remain unchanged.

### The Ministry Approves Three Measures for Deferred Trading: The Securities Exchange Formally Announces It Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have formally approved the continuation of deferred trading on the Securities Exchange and the payment of security deposits. The approval was issued on the 28th and brought to Shanghai by Gu Shanchang, the assistant manager of the Securities Exchange who had been sent to Nanjing for instructions. The Securities Exchange also announced the three measures approved by the Ministry yesterday: (1) Deferred trading will continue on a trial basis for three months. (2) The security deposit for deferred trading will be 50% of the transaction amount in cash. (3) 70% of the total security deposit should be deposited in the Central Bank. The above measures will take effect on July 1st.

The Securities Exchange held a meeting of the Standing Council at 10:00 AM yesterday. All members of the Standing Council attended on time, except for Wang Zhixin, who was absent due to a trip to Taiwan. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Du Yong. In addition to the report on the recent business situation by the Business Department, the new approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs regarding deferred trading was also reported. The meeting ended at 10:45 AM. The Securities Exchange immediately posted the three new approval measures in the market for public announcement.

Brokers Express Disappointment

Yesterday, brokers at the Securities Exchange expressed disappointment with the new approval of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, believing that the new measures for deferred trading will reduce normal trading and hinder the development of legitimate brokers' businesses. The black market and off-exchange trading will become more active. However, general observers believe that the government has its own unavoidable difficulties in implementing this new measure. Currently, the leaders of the brokers are exchanging opinions, hoping to request the government to reconsider through legal means.

Four Types of Stocks Approved for Listing (Report from this newspaper) The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved four types of stocks for listing on the 28th: (1) Zhabei Water and Electricity, (2) Huaxin Cement, (3) Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, and (4) Hengfeng Yarn Factory. The above stocks can be listed for trading once the listing procedures have been completed with the Securities Exchange.

Yongan Yarn Factory Has Some Off-Exchange Trading

Yesterday, during the holiday, trading inside the Shanghai stock exchange stopped, and only settlement was done. In the off-exchange black market, there were some transactions in Yongan Yarn Factory stocks, all at the current day's cash price. Initially, the price was 9,120 yuan, but later, due to tight credit conditions, sellers were eager to sell for cash, and the price was traded at 8,800 yuan around 12:00. Afterwards, there were no ten households interested. Even the market announced that settlement would be extended to the end of September. The crowd believed that such negative news had passed, and buyers switched to stocks. It was expected that the price would rebound, and the final price was 8,950 yuan. Red yarn was traded at around 9,500 yuan. There was no market for other stocks. The unified public price for Class C was called at over 8,200, but there were no transactions.

Off-Exchange Shanghai Stocks

Dasheng First Factory 7.4 million 7.5 million

Zhonghua Baoju 62,000 There were transactions

Huashang Electric 41,000 There were transactions

### The Committee of Discounted Loans Passes Public Loans of 7.3 Billion

The National Bank Discount Loan Committee held its 14th meeting at 4:00 PM on the 30th. Qin Runqing, Chen Duoru, Lu Chen, Shen Rixin, Lin Chongyong, and more than ten other people attended. The meeting was chaired by Qin Runqing and approved 35 industrial loan cases and 2 export material loan cases, for a total of 37 cases, with an approved amount of 7.36 billion yuan.

### Spot Cotton Transactions Are Slow

Yesterday, spot cotton transactions were slow, and the market was very quiet. After yarn factories resumed negotiating cotton yarn prices, costs were greatly restricted, and the absorption of cotton was minimal. Sellers, in view of the small amount of spot cotton remaining, were unwilling to sell. At the same time, due to the June end interest settlement, payments could not be immediately used, so there were very few transactions. In the afternoon, the opening price for Hankou fine cotton was 1.84 million, Lingbao was 1.95 million to 2.05 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 265,000 to 285,000 per dan. Only Lingbao had some factory delivery transactions, with a price of 2.12 million.

### Tea Transactions Are Not Strong

Yesterday's foreign firm tea market: Due to the eve of the June end settlement of silver and money, credit on the market almost came to a standstill, so the Wuchang Tea Company still signed deals. It continued to absorb last year's famous Tunchi Dabang and Pingshui Dabang teas, and the rest remained in a wait-and-see attitude. In terms of prices, although sellers tried to push prices up, it was ultimately difficult to advance under these circumstances, and the results were mostly similar to last week.

Domestic sales of red and green tea in this street's shops and Suzhou gangs remained unabated, and the situation hovered as before. It is reported that the previously quiet Shangbai chrysanthemum suddenly revived due to the Guangdong gang's acceptance, and transactions suddenly opened up. Opening prices were also extremely profitable, reportedly reaching 3 million yuan per dan.

[Another report] The first batch of new Wenzhou red boxed tea this year was transported by Anhe Company's Ankang yesterday with 286 boxes, which were sold by Quantai Tea Company. Samples are currently being distributed.

### Soliciting One Million Citizens to Subscribe to US Treasury Bonds; Solicitation Committee Drafting Measures

The US Dollar Bond Solicitation Committee held its third committee meeting yesterday at 4:00 PM, presided over by Qian Xinzhai, in the conference room on the third floor of the National Bank. Present were Du Yuesheng, Xu Qiguang, Song Hanwei, Shen Rixin, Qin Runqing, Li Shuming, Song Hongyuan, Pan Shihao, Hong Nianxing, Liu Jingzhuang, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Chen, Deputy Governor of the National Bank.

The meeting approved the principle of "Launching a Patriotic Movement to Solicit One Million Citizens to Subscribe to Short-Term Treasury Bonds." Detailed measures are being drafted, with the aim of starting no later than the 15th of this month and ending before the end of September. The primary subscribers will be citizens, particularly members of various social groups. The procedure will involve the association submitting the approved forms to various social groups, exchanging them for treasury bond subscription vouchers, thus eliminating the previous hassle of individual representatives engaging in buying and selling.

It was also learned that each person who subscribes to US$10 in bonds will receive an honorary certificate from the committee as a memento. Social groups and individuals who promote and subscribe the most will be rewarded separately by the Ministry of Finance. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. After the meeting, Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department, stated that the economic conditions for our treasury bonds are quite favorable, and he hoped everyone would purchase them promptly and not miss the opportunity.

[Another Report] Yesterday, being the end of the month, bond sales were unusually active, with public bonds totaling US$155,050 and treasury bonds totaling US$824,180, breaking records.

### Simplified Import Procedures to be Implemented on the 16th of This Month

To facilitate import merchants, the Import Management Committee has decided to simplify application procedures and formulate new simplified measures. It is understood that these new measures will be officially implemented on July 16. The committee will conduct a two-stage review for applications in Categories 1, 2, and 3 of the appendix. In the first stage, applicants fill out the application form and submit it to the committee for review, then request the issuance of a permit. As this procedure is cumbersome, it often delays the process. It is reported that under the new measures, the committee will review and issue both the application and the permit in one go, but all will be handled through designated banks. Applications submitted before the 15th will still be processed according to the old procedures. Applications submitted on the 16th will be reviewed according to the new procedures. The committee is currently printing the various forms.

### Rice Sales Are Lackluster; Medium and Lower Grades of White Japonica Rice Continue to Fall; Mainland Wheat Prices Decline and Flour Downstream

Yesterday, the North and South markets collectively received over 7,200 piculs of rice. Sales in the South market were lackluster. High-grade Japonica rice was still considered average, but medium and lower grades continued to fall by 3000-5000 yuan. Indica rice was dull and fell by 10,000 yuan, while white round rice also fell by 10,000 yuan. The North market remained relatively stable with little fluctuation.

Flour sales weakened, mainland wheat prices fell, and both foreign and factory flour saw a decline of 1000-2000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour fell by 3000-4000 yuan. Dull sales have turned price increases into declines. Bran is scarce and firm, rising by 1000 yuan. Soybean cake sales are scattered and not strong, sellers remain firm, and prices continued to rise by 1000-2000 yuan. Yingkou cake remains unchanged. Yellow soybeans see average sales and a slight increase of 2000-3000 yuan. Black soybeans see active sales in Nanyang, with a sharp increase in prices and a particularly aggressive rise, with high grades skyrocketing by 30,000-40,000 yuan, bringing the average price up by 10,000 yuan, exceeding the 300,000 mark. Red beans are being purchased in South China, and popsicle sales in the city are still brisk, leading to a new high price, breaking the 300,000 mark, skyrocketing by 30,000-40,000 yuan.

Kidney beans see movement in Shantou, rising by 4000-5000 yuan. Wheat arrivals are not abundant, gradually increasing by 4000-5000 yuan. Sesame is in short supply, with many inquiries, and the situation is tight. Raw peanuts are being heavily purchased by Guangdong merchants, and local shops are following suit, gradually increasing prices, adding another 10,000 yuan. Sorghum is firm, and there are slight inquiries about corn from the North, continuing to rise by 3000-5000 yuan.

It is heard that merchants from South China are still continuing to purchase oil, and local shops have strengthened their intake due to the two-day closure, with prices reaching new highs, skyrocketing by 50,000-60,000 yuan. The next two days are the bank's settlement period, and the market will be closed for two days.

[This Newspaper's Report] 5,000 bags of flour from the China Trust Bureau were loaded onto the China Merchants Bureau's Hainan轮 (Lún) yesterday and transported to Tianjin. Recently, the amount of commercial goods transported from Shanghai to Tianjin has gradually decreased, presumably due to the situation in North China.

### Woolen Fabric Prices Are Firm and Strong

The woolen fabric market has recently seen rising prices in Hong Kong, resulting in fewer shipments arriving in Shanghai. Local factory goods are priced higher than current goods, and the overall price increase has kept woolen fabrics consistently strong. Both buyers and sellers see a bright future. As for sales, there are few domestic customers.

### After New Yarn Prices Are Agreed Upon, Textile Construction Begins Preparing for Yarn Allocation; 20,000 Pieces Are Scheduled to Be Allocated in the First Half of July

[This Newspaper's Report] After the Textile Adjustment Committee announced the implementation of the joint allocation system yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company immediately began handling yarn allocation procedures, allocating yarn at the new price. (See the business news column below for the allocated price of each type of yarn). Payment procedures remain the same as originally stipulated by the Textile Construction Company. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company hung a sign, renaming itself the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee Joint Yarn Allocation. Yesterday, a total of 307 applications were received from various replicating industries, and 530 pieces of various types of yarn were approved for allocation. Although the Textile Adjustment Committee claimed that it had received over 1,000 pieces of yarn from various private factories yesterday, the Textile Construction Company had not yet received any opening yarn orders. Therefore, all the yarn allocated yesterday was still sold by the Textile Construction Company.

It is heard that the Textile Adjustment Committee's joint allocation system has tentatively set the total amount of yarn to be allocated in the first half of July at 20,000 pieces, with state-owned and private yarn factories each accounting for half. According to the joint allocation system regulations announced by the Textile Adjustment Committee, all yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories should be uniformly managed by the Textile Adjustment Committee for joint pricing and joint allocation. However, private factories hope for joint pricing and individual allocation. Private factories are still attached to their existing customer base. If yarn production is uniformly managed for joint allocation, it will inevitably affect the business freedom of private factories. The Textile Adjustment Committee and private factories are still discussing solutions on this point.

According to a spokesperson for the Textile Adjustment Committee yesterday, after the implementation of the joint allocation system: (1) All yarn sales transactions by state-owned and private yarn factories must be approved by the Textile Adjustment Committee from now on. (2) The allocation target is primarily end-users. (3) All yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories will be uniformly managed by the Textile Adjustment Committee, which will entrust the Textile Construction Company to allocate it on its behalf. It is reported that the more than 1,200 pieces of yarn previously stored by the Textile Management Committee have already been transferred to this committee for receipt. Furthermore, as of the 30th, private yarn factories had already delivered over 1,000 pieces of various types of yarn to the committee for joint allocation.

### Tight Coal Market

In the coal market, bituminous coal sellers remain cautious, and the market remains tight. Only a few sellers, pressured by financial constraints at the end of the month, slightly sold at high prices. Anthracite prices are chaotic, especially high-grade Jiaozuo lump coal, where both supply and demand are lacking, with transaction prices in the range of 2.1 to 2.2 million yuan. Coking coal prices are rising more slowly, with more arrivals and active sales. Coal briquette factories have successively adjusted their selling prices due to rising labor and material costs, with large factories charging 660,000 yuan per ton and small factories charging 600,000 yuan. However, sales are sluggish due to the off-season. Firewood and charcoal follow the trend of the coal market, with prices rising rapidly.

### Flourishing Taiwanese Alkali Industry; Production Leads the Nation

(Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 30th) Taiwan's alkali industry is flourishing and its current production leads the nation. According to Fang Yiju, General Manager of the Taiwan Alkali Company, the company currently owns three factories in Kaohsiung, Tainan, and Anping. Its main products are caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and bleaching powder, which have a wide range of applications. Currently, the monthly production of solid caustic soda is 300 tons, hydrochloric acid is 100 tons, and bleaching powder is 200 tons. The production of other various products has also increased by more than double since the takeover period. Currently, demand for alkali is strong throughout the country, with people coming to Taiwan to purchase it. In addition to supplying local soap, paper, oil refining, and aluminum manufacturing factories, since April of this year, the company has allocated 600 tons. At a price of 300,000 Taiwan dollars per ton, this amounts to 180 million Taiwan dollars, but demand is still not being met.

Fang continued to say that Taiwan has abundant water, electricity, and raw materials such as lime, making it an ideal place to develop the alkali industry. The future plan is to increase production. The company has already restored 2,500 acres of salt fields, with 7,000 acres under restoration. By the end of the year, there will be 10,000 acres of salt fields available for use. It also plans to build a new factory in Kaohsiung and has ordered new-style electrical machinery and factory equipment from the United States. It is estimated that when the factory is completed, it will be able to produce 1,000 tons of solid alkali, 600 tons of hydrochloric acid, and 500 tons of bleaching powder per month.

### UNRRA Transporting Cotton to China; Manufacturers Can Exchange It for Cotton Yarn; One Piece of 20-Count Yarn Can Be Exchanged for 760 Pounds of Cotton

As of June 18 of this year, 127,868 bales of UNRRA-allocated cotton have been transported to China. Among them, 61,484 bales have been distributed by the Executive Yuan at a price of 7.45 million national currency per picul to 32 textile factories according to the distribution quota stipulated by the former Textile Management Committee. Currently, there are still 66,384 bales of cotton in various warehouses. In order to continue distributing this cotton and avoid the increase in cotton prices affecting other commodity prices, the Executive Yuan has decided to adopt an exchange method. Manufacturers who have obtained UNRRA cotton allocation quotas can apply to the Executive Yuan to order cotton based on a ratio of 760 pounds of foreign cotton exchanged for one piece of 20-count cotton yarn weighing 400 pounds. The new method has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record-keeping. The Executive Yuan will notify manufacturers within this week to negotiate and sign contracts.

### Yokohama Specie Bank Declares Closure

(Associated Press, Tokyo, 30th) Japan's most famous Yokohama Specie Bank declared closure on the 30th. The bank was Japan's main representative in overseas finance before the war and has a history of 68 years. Since the Japanese government officially announced post-war measures to rebuild Japan's finances, the bank has actually been in a state of closure.

### Remittances from Overseas Chinese Sharply Decline in May; Only 10.5 Billion Yuan, a 50% Decrease Compared to April

Remittances from overseas Chinese handled by the Bank of China have been steadily declining due to the large difference between the officially set foreign exchange rate and the black market rate. According to the bank's published figures for May, the total amount of remittances from the Americas, Europe, and Southeast Asia was only 10,536,666,731.36 yuan. This is a 50% decrease compared to the 20.7 billion yuan in April. The severity of the evasion of remittances from overseas Chinese can be seen from this.

Reports from various sources indicate a further significant decrease in June, possibly less than half of May. Remittances from Southeast Asia have almost disappeared and are being evaded through Hong Kong. After remittances are sent to Hong Kong, the remittance drafts are brought to Guangzhou for sale. General merchants purchase them and then send them abroad to purchase materials. This is a gradually public fact.

Of the remittances received in May, New York accounted for the largest share, at 7,795,419,186 yuan. Next was Havana, Cuba, at 1,008,762,870 yuan. Third was London, at 23,048,1937.37 yuan.

The remaining amounts were small. Sydney, Australia, accounted for 165,084,449 yuan. Calcutta, India, accounted for 124,085,836.35 yuan. Yangon accounted for 62,777,600 yuan, Singapore accounted for 5,190,000 yuan, Kuala Lumpur accounted for 1,173,600 yuan, and Penang accounted for 5,370,000 yuan. Saigon, Vietnam, accounted for 20,482,504.52 yuan, and Batavia, Dutch East Indies, accounted for 910 million yuan. Foreign agency stores accounted for 129,050,518.14 yuan. The total was 10,536,666,731.36 yuan.

### Taiwanese Pineapple Exports Are Active; American Merchants Are Coming to Place Orders

Taiwan's special product, pineapple, is again entering the summer harvest season. The planted area of pineapple in Taiwan was once over 10,000 hectares, with a harvest of 140,000 to 150,000 tons of fresh fruit. 60% of this is made into canned goods, with exports reaching a maximum of 1.6 million boxes. Before the war, its products were as famous as those from Hawaii and Singapore. However, both Hawaii and Singapore have been affected by the war, resulting in a sharp decrease in production and unmet demand. Recently, the Taiwan Pineapple Company has repeatedly received American merchants sending personnel to Taiwan to place orders. The company's canned pineapple exports are very active.

### Import Surcharge to Continue for Another Year

According to an announcement by the Jianghai Customs authorities, the 5% surcharge on import goods based on customs duties, which was originally scheduled to stop at the end of June, has now been decided to continue for another year from today (July 1st).

Timber Market Stable

The timber market has been relatively stable recently. Foreign fir arrived yesterday, estimated at over one million feet. Fir prices are slightly soft and weak, with foreign pine priced around 8,000 yuan and fir around 3,000 yuan. If there are no unexpected movements, the market situation is likely to hover for a long time.

### Statistics on Deposits in Banks and Financial Institutions for the First Five Months of This Year

### China Trust Bureau is in Discussions Regarding the Purchase of Stale Tea

Although the authorities have repeatedly expressed their determination to handle the purchase of stale tea from 1946, there has been no follow-up to date. According to sources yesterday, the tea mortgage loans from the Central Bank introduced by the China National Agricultural Corporation for tea merchants in Shanghai expired on the 3rd of this month. However, given the widespread slump in tea prices today, merchants are unable to repay the loans. Therefore, government purchase of stale tea is imperative. It is heard that the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau and the China United Tea Corporation are currently discussing the purchase price: 720,000 yuan per picul for Keemun black tea, 660,000 yuan for Tunxi green tea, and 480,000 yuan for Ping green tea. Tea merchants claim that this price was set months ago, and prices have since risen several times, requesting a general increase of 20%.

### The Yuyao Salt Fields: A Visit

— Hangzhou Dispatch, June 27th. Our reporter, Huang Xing Tian.

Like a fan spread out on the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay, a vast plain connecting the sea and sky, the soil always tinged with white, this is the largest salt supply area in southeastern China – the Yuyao Salt Fields. This area, centered on Andong, includes seven townships with a population of 100,000. Administratively, it surpasses Yuyao County, but due to the autocratic nature of salt administration over the past few centuries, salt farmers only knew the salt field director and not the county magistrate. Recently, the salt farmers' households have been registered with the county government, but the area still retains its special character. To understand the current situation of this abundant producing area of eastern Zhejiang, I, the reporter, after arriving in Yuyao, was accompanied by Secretary Zhao and others to visit the rich fields.

The Central Area of Andong

Traveling north from Yuyao by jeep for seventy *li* (approximately 35 kilometers), about forty minutes, one arrives at the center of the salt fields – Andong. Here, there is a main street, very narrow, like a typical Jiangnan market town. Besides the fixed shops, there is also a market centered on stalls. Business is thriving. Prices are higher than in Yuyao city. Because of the high cost of living, wages are also higher than elsewhere. It is said that in other towns, hiring an old woman to chant Buddhist scriptures costs only five hundred yuan per day, in addition to meals, while in the salt fields, it costs three thousand yuan.

According to the Yuyao Salt Field Director, Wang Ting, he told the reporter that the salt field is seventy *li* long from east to west and fifteen *li* wide from north to south. Due to the influence of changes in the currents of Hangzhou Bay, it is gradually shifting north. The Salt Field Office moved north to Andong in the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916). The total area is as large as 99,000 *mu* (approximately 6,600 hectares). Before the war, there were 730,000 salt pans (including 550,000 official pans), producing 4.8 million *dan* (approximately 240,000 metric tons) of salt annually, accounting for six-tenths of the total production of Zhejiang Province, and together with Shandong, Lianghuai, and Changlu, it was known as one of the four major salt fields. After being occupied by the enemy in April of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941), the enemy built bamboo fences to surround the salt area and control salt, causing food shortages in free Zhejiang, eastern Jiangxi, and southern Anhui. At the same time, they intensified their exploitation. At that time, the salt farmers had no rice to eat all year round and only used sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains as meals. Some salt farmers sold furniture such as beds and tables in the city, and then bought some coarse rice to cook porridge at home, which they considered the greatest luxury! The suffering of the salt farmers is evident from this. After the victory, the government復員 [restored public order], which slightly alleviated the plight of the salt farmers. According to statistics, there are currently 5,822 salt households, totaling about 60,000 people, and 21,000 salt workers. There are a total of 539,680 salt pans, which is much less than before the war. Therefore, salt production has also decreased. Last year, only 2 million *dan* were harvested, and this year it is estimated to be 2.1 million *dan*. The salt produced supplies 31 counties and one city in this province, about 700,000 *dan* annually, 600,000 *dan* to Jiangsu, about 200,000 *dan* to eastern Jiangxi, and about 120,000 *dan* to southern Anhui.

Salt Pans: Salt Farmers' Property

Because the seawater in Hangzhou Bay is relatively less salty, the salt-making methods in the Yuyao Salt Fields are different from those in Lianghuai and Shandong. They use the alkaline properties in the soil to make brine, and then dry it in the sun, so the cost is much higher than directly drying salt from seawater. The land in the salt fields is said to be public, but in reality, there is private ownership. These landowners consider the number of salt pans to be their property. Salt farmers rent land to make salt, and the rental price is also calculated based on the number of salt pans. The usual rent for a salt pan is seventy to one hundred *jin* (approximately 35 to 50 kilograms) of salt per year. This is the same as landlords collecting rent in grain. Therefore, the status of salt farmers is the same as that of tenant farmers in ordinary villages. And the vast majority of farmers are tenant farmers who rent salt pans to dry salt. After renting the salt pans, the salt farmers "rely on the heavens" and use the processes of "scooping, leaching, spreading, and drying" to make snow-white salt to exchange for yellow and white grains of rice. Their simple equipment consists of a pile of earth built in a corner of the white land (i.e., salt land), with a round pit dug on top and lined with straw, called a "leach bowl." The bottom of this bowl is connected to a bamboo pipe that leads to a wooden bucket buried in the mud nearby. When making salt, one must first scoop up the soil containing salt, then gather it and pour it into the leaching bowl, then fill it with seawater. After one or two hours, the salt in the soil mixes with the seawater and becomes brine, which is then poured into the bucket through the bamboo pipe. The quality of the brine (i.e., the concentration of alkalinity) is measured using a bamboo spoon with three to five *mukouzi* [wood lotus seeds] at the bottom, similar to the ones used in ordinary wine shops or oil shops to measure wine or oil, but cruder. When this spoon is filled with brine, if all the wood lotus seeds float, then it is the best. Then, the brine is transported to the drying field and poured onto the salt pans to evaporate the water. The salt pans are rectangular, about six or seven *chi* (approximately 2 to 2.3 meters) long and about three *chi* (approximately 1 meter) wide, with wooden strips about two *cun* (approximately 6.7 centimeters) high nailed around the edges to prevent the water from flowing out. If the sun is strong, after three or four hours, one can see a patch of snow-white salt on the salt pan.

10,000 *Dan* of Salt Produced Daily

Salt farmers "rely on the heavens" because their production depends entirely on nature and the weather. In spring and winter (approximately from December to May or June of the following year), the soil in the salt fields is mostly wet, and not much salt is absorbed; moreover, the sunshine is also relatively weak, and the time for water evaporation increases, so production is sharply reduced. This period is called the off-season by salt farmers. After June, it is the peak season. In summer and autumn, the white land is drier and easier to absorb salt; and the sunshine is strong, making drying easier, and production increases greatly. When the reporter visited, it could produce 10,000 *dan* per day. But it has not yet reached its peak. The hotter the weather, the more the production. On average, a salt pan can produce 300 *jin* per year. The reporter interviewed a salt farmer with a family of six, who rented sixty salt pans and could obtain 18,000 *jin* of salt per year. With a rent of 70 *jin* per pan, they had to pay 4,200 *jin*. The remaining, calculated at the current price of 29,000 yuan per *dan*, could earn 4.02 million yuan. After deducting 2.5% for welfare donations (about 100,000 yuan), they had an average of about 300,000 yuan per month, which was barely enough to eat and live on. But if they needed to repair or replace salt-making equipment, they would have to switch to eating some miscellaneous grains. As for the landlords in the salt fields, they are very comfortable, like those in the countryside. They do not have to make salt and rarely live in the salt fields. They live in the city all year round, relying on collecting salt rent. It is said that the largest landlord owns more than 10,000 salt pans. If calculated at the lower rent of 70 *jin* per pan, he can collect 700,000 *jin* of salt per year, which means he can earn more than 20 billion yuan in huge profits (at the current price). Isn't it easier to make money than other large enterprises? All he has to do is own some salt pans, and even the production tools are provided by the salt farmers themselves.

Production Greatly Restricted

So, why not make more salt pans? This is already one of the important disputes between the salt farmers and the Salt Field Office today. Since the War of Resistance, the Yuyao Salt Fields have lost 170,000 salt pans, and production has fallen to half of what it was before the war! And the salt farmers have plenty of extra labor to engage in salt production, so why doesn't the Salt Field Office allow them to increase the number of salt pans? According to Director Wang, it is to avoid overproduction. If production is too high, it cannot be transported and sold. The total salt production in the country can reach 44 million *dan*, but only 34 million *dan* can be sold. The cost of salt production in Yuyao is relatively high, and fortunately, 1 million *dan* have already been overstocked. But we are also not satisfied with this explanation, because brine is of extreme importance in industrial and national defense materials. Although China's industry is backward, a large amount of salt is needed for dyeing plants for sizing, for soap factories for liquid separation, for ice-making factories to reduce the temperature, for making tanned leather, for making dry batteries, etc. Before the war, 4.8 million *dan* were produced annually, but this year only 2.1 million *dan* can be produced. Why restrict production? Now, the process from salt production to consumption, although it has changed from "produced by the people, collected by the government, transported by the government, and sold by the government" to "produced by the people, collected by the government, transported by merchants (or entrusted to merchants by the government), and sold by merchants," perhaps it would be more helpful to salt production and the lives of salt farmers if the state monopoly was abandoned and it was changed to a state of free sales.

Petition for 1000 Salt per Stone of Rice

Not long ago, salt farmers petitioned the province and went to the capital, demanding a salt price of "one thousand salt for rice" (exchanging one thousand *jin* of salt for one hundred and fifty *jin* of rice). This issue has not been fully resolved to this day. In the early days of復員 [restoring public order], the price of salt was 200 yuan per *dan*, but by the end of last year, it had reached 4,000 yuan. After the petition, it was agreed in principle, and the price was negotiated by the salt farmers and the labor union and then approved by the Salt Field Office every month. The current price is 29,000 yuan per *dan*, while the price of rice is only 230,000 to 40,000 yuan, so it has exceeded the request. A salt woman who works like a man, pointing to the hot rice in the pot, told the reporter in a very satisfied and happy voice, "Now we can eat rice for three meals a day." I looked at it. Although it was yellow coarse rice, and it was very simple side dishes, she was so happy and grateful. The demands of the salt farmers were originally very low and very reasonable. However, the satisfaction with the current situation is temporary, and it may change with changes in prices. Director Wang said: "According to government orders, salt must be controlled by the government, and salt farmers must hand over the salt they produce to the government warehouse, and the government will grant them 'production loans.' The current production loans are issued at the full market price; but during the peak production season, due to insufficient loans, only a few parts of it will be paid first. He also advocated that the salt price should be raised to 'one thousand salt for a stone of rice' during the off-season, because salt farmers produce less; but during the peak production season, when production is sufficient, it should be reduced to 'one thousand salt for one hundred *jin* of rice.'" But according to Han Shizhou, the secretary of the Salt Industry Labor Union, "In fact, the prosperity of salt production and sales is the opposite. The off-season is the peak sales season, and the peak production season is the off-sales season. Therefore, the pricing standard of the Salt Field Office is unreasonable. Moreover, the salt farmers do not know about production loans, but only know about salt funds. They take the salt to sell to the government, and they have to recover the salt funds and go home to buy rice to eat. Therefore, if the office wants to withhold salt funds, it is unreasonable and unjustifiable to the salt farmers." Therefore, the salt price issue is lurking with waves. Now, the police and the people just hope that the Salt Field Office will abolish the pricing policy to avoid being restricted by price fluctuations and being forced to eat sweet potato soup again without rice to eat.

Pengl Chief Changed to Warehouse Chief

The salt affairs administrative structure is also worth our attention. In the era of the *pengl* chief system, the economic affairs of the salt farmers were entirely in the hands of the *pengl* chief. When the salt farmers carried the salt to hand over, even if it was clearly 100 *jin*, he would weigh it and say it was only 80 *jin*, and it would be 80 *jin*. If he wanted to say that the salt was black, the salt farmers had no way to argue. When paying the salt funds (that is, issuing production loans), he would deduct the funds and only issue a few parts, or even delay payment; and he would take the money to do business himself or resell it to lend to the salt farmers at high interest rates, taking the salt farmers' hard-earned money to exploit them. The suffering of the salt farmers can be imagined. However, the salt farmers are kind. Nine-tenths of them are Shaoxing people, and one-tenth are local Yuyao people. For hundreds of years, they have been bearing the burden of life and struggling to continue their lives. Until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), the accumulated heavy pressure erupted in their intolerable anger, resulting in salt police firing, killing and injuring hundreds of people. After the victory, through the efforts of the salt farmers and the industry labor union, the Salt Affairs Office finally improved a lot. They abandoned the *pengl* chief and changed it to warehouse chief. The salt farmers have reportedly requested the implementation of democratic "warehouse chief elections" and would be satisfied if they could only have their own representatives to supervise.

Building Seven Dikes for Reclamation

Due to the influence of the sea tides, the salt land in Yuyao gradually expanded north. Therefore, after a certain period, the original white land, because it was further away from the sea, the salt production was sharply reduced, so it was necessary to build dikes for reclamation and plant cotton or other suitable plants. After about a hundred years, a dike must be built. Now, seven dikes have been built. The reporter drove north from Yuyao, passing through the first, second, and new dikes. Between the dikes, rice is planted, or cotton and wheat are planted. There is no trace of the salt fields. The changes of the sea are great. Thatched houses and earthen graves stand side by side. One cannot help but sigh at the impermanence of life. The seventh dike started construction last December. It is 15 kilometers long, involves 320,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and is 85% complete. It is expected to be completed by the end of June. After the dike is completed, salt cannot be produced inside the dike in one or two years, so how to desalinate the soil is the urgent task of the salt farmers. However, after the Salt Field Office built the dike, it has been slow to open the holes, and the water cannot get out, so the salinity cannot be removed, and planting is impossible. The 25,000 *mu* of land inside the dike will not benefit from it and will suffer from it. Therefore, when the salt farmers talked to the reporter about the dike issue, they were all filled with sorrow. Once this 25,000 *mu* of white land really cannot produce salt or grow cotton, how will the salt farmers make a living? I hope that the salt affairs authorities can seek the current and future welfare of the salt farmers in every way, and don't push them away!

### Crimson Blood in the Central Plains

— Special dispatch from Kaifeng, 24th. Xu Jin

The Central Plains are the fertile land of Chinese culture, but now they have become a battlefield. Not only is it difficult to find the breath of culture, but even some natural landscapes have been shattered and changed by the shock of artillery fire. We don't need to talk about anything too distant. Ever since the enemy invaded Henan by railway in the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China (1938), the common people have not had a single day of peace. The Yellow River washed away most of eastern Henan, and the figures for people's lives and property are still difficult to count. The drought in the thirty-first year of the Republic of China (1942) created a terrifying situation in southern Puyang. Roots, bark, grass, salted earth, all became the main food of the people, and even some more tragic and bizarre things happened that those who had not experienced the situation personally could not believe. When the Central Plains fell to the enemy in the thirty-third year of the Republic of China (1944), almost no part of Henan was free of the enemy, and the common people lived in deep water and hot fire, but they had no complaints. Their only hope was to drive the Japanese devils out so they could live a peaceful life.

Since the Chinese Communists closed the door to peace talks, Henan has fallen into a new round of war. How can the people who have suffered so much bear such torment? The government has the responsibility to protect the country and the people and cannot ignore their life and death. Therefore, sharp conflicts have occurred between the local government and the Communist army, and all kinds of tragic events have been staged. On the night of January 31, more than 10,000 troops under Liu Bocheng sneaked from Zhecheng to Luyi. At that time, the team guarding the city had only a little over a thousand people. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Sun Jingxuan immediately deployed defenses inside the city and was determined to coexist with the city. At first, only scattered gunshots could be heard, but later they became more and more dense, and the sound became deafening. The artillery fire flew through the air, appearing even brighter under the starlight.

One night passed. The next morning, the Communist bandits' artillery fire became even more intense, but our army continued to fight back, and the Communist bandits' corpses were strewn across the city. While the two sides were fighting fiercely, an unfortunate thing happened at this time. The troops guarding the Dawang Temple suddenly all defected, and the West Gate was lost. After noon, the Communist bandits concentrated their artillery fire on the West Gate. Under the fierce artillery fire, the West Gate was completely destroyed, and the Communist army poured into the city, engaging in street fighting with the defending troops. The two sides fought repeatedly in hand-to-hand combat for two hours. In the end, due to the disparity in numbers, the defending troops were defeated, and County Magistrate Sun was captured after running out of ammunition and reinforcements. Also captured were Ji Shoupeng, the leader of the Second District Training Team, and Wang Yingtang, the head of the county self-defense force. From then on, County Magistrate Sun began a hunger strike and refused to talk to the Communist bandits. To vent their anger, the Communist bandits took County Magistrate Sun to Shuanglouji in the southwest of the city and killed him. It is said that County Magistrate Sun was from Shangqiu and was 39 years old. He studied at Peking University and served as the commander of the East Henan Guerrilla, the commander of the Anti-Enemy Self-Defense, brigade commander, and deputy division commander during the War of Resistance. After the victory, he became the magistrate of Luyi County.

Zhecheng County in eastern Henan is also a county frequently harassed by the Communist bandits. When County Magistrate Lu Chuanzhi was the magistrate of Minquan County, the Communist bandits besieged the county seat. County Magistrate Lu fought hard against the Communist bandits with a small number of national troops for sixteen days and nights and finally repelled the Communist bandits, thus creating a brilliant record in eastern Henan. On March 6, more than a thousand troops under Jin Shaoshan suddenly attacked the suburbs of the city, and a fierce battle broke out. However, our side had not yet been fully replenished after the new setback and was attacked again, which felt really unsustainable. After a bitter fight, they broke through and reached Lingziyang (northeast of the city) to reorganize and deploy. However, County Magistrate Lu, filled with anger, was difficult to suppress, so he led his team back into the county seat that night and fought with the bandits all night, killing and wounding many of the Communist bandits. In order to reduce casualties, County Magistrate Lu broke through again and moved to Yanzhuang in the northeast of the city, preparing to wait for an opportunity to counterattack. Unexpectedly, before he could catch his breath, the Communist bandits chased him and surrounded Yanzhuang. County Magistrate Lu led the remnants of his troops to resist, and finally died heroically after running out of ammunition and reinforcements.

Another unfortunate thing happened in Sui County. On March 8, news was received that the Communist bandits were attacking the city. The Communist bandits who came to attack were troops under Jin Shaoshan and Wang Qimei, totaling about 5,000 people, while the defending troops only had the Sixth Column of the Provincial Security and the County Self-Defense Force. The disparity in strength was very large. At about 7 p.m., the entire city was surrounded by the Communist army. That night, they launched seven fierce attacks on the county seat in a row. Thanks to County Magistrate Yin and Commander Yang personally supervising the defense, they were not successful. On the morning of the 10th, the artillery fire became more intense because it was already daylight and the targets were obvious. The fortifications inside the city were destroyed by the bandits' artillery fire, and most of the officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and the ammunition was about to run out. Just at this moment, the Communist army took the opportunity to enter the city, and the team engaged in bayonet fighting with the Communist army. At this time, the intensity of the fighting can be said to have reached its peak. Our garden team was almost completely killed or wounded, and the county seat fell. In the chaotic situation, County Magistrate Yin and Commander Yang were both captured.

The Communist bandits also knew that County Magistrate Yin was a capable person, so they tried every means to lure him to join them, but they did not know County Magistrate Yin's firm and unyielding spirit. Although they tried to induce him repeatedly, he refused with harsh words and was unmoved. Later, thousands of people asked the Communist army to release County Magistrate Yin. They knew that it was difficult to achieve their goal, so on March 16, they sent County Magistrate Yin to the headquarters of the First Military Sub-district of the traitorous bandits and advised him to donate money and land to comfort the families of the traitorous bandits who had died, but County Magistrate Yin still refused to accept it and asked to die quickly, so he was killed. County Magistrate Yin was very loved by the people in Sui County, and now the elders of Sui County still remember him with tears in their eyes.

The most painful thing was the death of Hu, the magistrate of Ningling County. The incident occurred at 1 a.m. on April 3, when the Communist bandits attacked the city with five regiments. The first sound was heard in the southwest of the city. In an instant, the sound of guns around the city became a chorus. County Magistrate Hu was able to remain calm, calmly directing the battle on the one hand and deeply studying countermeasures on the other. However, the armed forces defending the city had only one battalion of the National Army and two self-defense companies, totaling only 500 people, which was indeed an arduous task. The battle cry outside the city became more and more urgent, and County Magistrate Hu personally braved artillery fire to direct the battle, and the morale was extremely high. After a fierce battle all night, countless bandits were killed, but due to the exhaustion of ammunition and reinforcements, they also gradually turned to decline. At dawn on the 4th, the situation became more serious, and the gunfire was more intense than before. Many strongholds in the city were occupied by the bandits, and the wounded officers and soldiers were carried down one after another, and the entire city was shrouded in artillery fire. In order to facilitate command and ensure complete security, County Magistrate Hu and Commander Yang moved to the residence of Zhang, the speaker of the Ningling County Council. At this time, the Communist bandits were even more arrogant because they had occupied the strongholds in the city. County Magistrate Hu knew that the situation was gone and there was no way to survive, so he wrote a poem with emotion and wrote it on the wall of Speaker Zhang's residence. The words were:

Why do you have to shed tears?

Taking righteousness and becoming benevolent is in this moment.

After thousands of years on the Huabiao pillar,

The loyal soul will still reach the people.

After County Magistrate Hu finished writing the poem, the sound of artillery became more and more dense, and it was at this moment that the Communist bandits poured into the city like bees. After two hours of street fighting, the team was almost completely killed or wounded, and Commander Yang was captured. County Magistrate Hu was worried and anxious, so he put on casual clothes and entered a butcher's house, wanting to find a sharp blade to commit suicide, but he could not find it anywhere. In the midst of extreme urgency, he suddenly found an iron spindle for spinning cotton. County Magistrate Hu grasped this iron spindle tightly and stabbed his head fiercely, immediately fainting to the ground. Later, he was discovered by the Communist bandits, who saw that he still had some breath and wanted to carry him to Zhao Zeng to claim credit. When they carried him to the outside of the South Gate, the traitorous bandits had already left the city. When they saw County Magistrate Hu's head covered in blood, they not only had no sympathy, but also increased their anger, so they used their guns to shoot at his head, and he died immediately. They pushed his body into the moat before leaving in a swarm. Afterwards, when the people heard about it, they retrieved the body from the moat and prepared a coffin at their own expense, and had it cremated on the left side of the South Gate of Ningling City.

Northern Henan fell earliest during the War of Resistance, and has been ravaged by the enemy for the past eight years. Now, after the Yellow River changed its course, the Communist bandits want to seize what they call the Jin-Yu-Lu corridor, which has become a place they are desperately fighting for. The common people are just tools in their eyes. The disaster that the local area has suffered from them is truly indescribable. Now, the war in northern Henan is still spreading, and the people's desire for the government to rescue them is like a severe drought hoping for clouds.

Weekly Forum

### Tracing Mr. Zhang Jian's Aspirations and Spirit

— Zhang Yuanyang

Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong was the greatest and most accomplished entrepreneur in the modern Chinese enlightenment movement. His brilliant achievements in his career stemmed from his lofty and unique aspirations and spirit. To continue and promote Mr. Nantong's cause and spirit, we must first understand the characteristics of his aspirations and spirit. Here, I respectfully present my humble observations, elucidating Mr. Nantong's career aspirations and spiritual manifestations, for the consideration of contemporary scholars who admire this virtuous predecessor.

One. Mr. Nantong's Career Aspirations

First, Mr. Nantong's career progressed from private to public, transforming private interests into public benefit. His career development seemed to follow a certain thread and process: first industry, then education, followed by charity and public welfare, and then military and political affairs. Industry was a privately run enterprise, while education and charity were services for the public. Even in terms of industry and education, they were initially privately operated, but then transformed into company or board organizations to serve the public and contribute to society. He was undoubtedly an orthodox figure in Chinese philosophy, adhering to the Confucian principles of "success need not be mine" and "the world belongs to all." At the same time, he also possessed the Taoist virtues of "acting without possessing" and "retiring after success." This is a virtue that modern entrepreneurs, especially those who value utilitarianism, can hardly demonstrate. Mr. Nantong was born into this, practiced it personally, and fulfilled his task of setting an example for future generations.

Second, Mr. Nantong often exhausted his own efforts and extended them to others when running his businesses. The period in which he started new businesses was not as convenient as it is now. Although conditions were inadequate and obstacles were numerous, he advanced with a strong determination, indomitable perseverance, and a steadfast commitment to exhausting his own efforts, infused with the Buddhist spirit of "I will enter hell." Once the business showed a glimmer of hope, he quickly turned it into a model, creating a reputation for it, so that people from near and far would come to visit and learn. This was not to show off or use it as a political means. If one were to look at running a business from a commercial perspective, one should seek exclusive patents. Why encourage everyone to compete and rush to do the same thing? Therefore, this approach was solely to enable all localities to follow suit, taking the same path, to benefit the country and the people. This is the consistent principle of patriotism and love for the people, extending oneself to others with loyalty and empathy, practically applied in business.

Third, Mr. Nantong always maintained benevolence in his heart and clarity in his actions. Mr. Zhang's sentiment always embraced the Buddhist teachings of compassion for all beings, aiming to save the world and its people. Therefore, when he started his production business in an era of uncertainty and lack of resources, it was naturally not for making money but for saving the country and its people. Every bit of effort was aimed at benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood. He can truly be considered a person who maintained benevolence in his heart and practiced great benevolence with great wisdom and courage. At the same time, he believed that to be benevolent to the people, one must start with cherishing things and using production as a means, so that benevolence to the people would not be empty. Therefore, he reclaimed tens of millions of acres of barren saline land on the coast of northern Jiangsu, transforming it into fertile cotton fields and large-scale salt production sites, directly supporting millions of people and creating dozens of towns. Isn't this the fruit of his great benevolence, wisdom, and courage? At that time, he believed that the country was in a critical and precarious state, and what he was doing were practical things to save the country and its people. He wanted foreigners to know, and neighboring countries to acknowledge, that even if China were to unfortunately perish, there was still someone whose heart would not perish; even if China were in chaos, there were still people with a vision working to build a country for lasting peace and stability. This kind of vision and the sentiment of a loyal minister in troubled times are truly sad and touching, stirring the heart!

Fourth, Mr. Nantong was good at establishing education based on affairs and achieving success through education. Mr. Zhang's establishment of new education had a special contribution and status in the history of Chinese education. He focused on military and national education, normal school education, and practical talent education. He was a writer and a politician but did not run literature or law education. He wanted to run businesses, so he had an education to match each business, creating the profound saying "Father industry, mother education." Therefore, Nantong had all kinds of educational undertakings to match various businesses. Specialization, technicalization, socialization, and militarization in education were his educational goals. Establishing education based on affairs in this way can ensure education for all without waste. At the same time, he also used education to promote the establishment, growth, and development of some businesses. Any business that cannot be academic and specialized will not have a bright future and long-term progress. Mr. Zhang's sharp eyes saw this early on. When he founded China's textile industry, he also founded textile education at the same time. Textile factories nourished textile education, and textile education provided the textile industry with specialized technical talents. Although this is only one example, it can encompass all other businesses and education.

Two. Mr. Nantong's Spiritual Manifestations

First, the spirit of pioneering and establishing traditions despite humble beginnings. Looking at the businesses personally founded by Mr. Zhang, each business was unprecedented, transforming from nothing to something. They were always carried out in a bold and pioneering manner. Whether it was textiles, salt reclamation, water conservancy, transportation, or even education, all included a spirit of creation. This is truly the spirit necessary for the great era of building an industry and a country. At that time, there was a group of people who advocated preserving the national essence, saying "Chinese learning for substance, Western learning for application." It seemed that the spirit of creation was not very necessary. Even today, fifty years later, there are still some conservatives who say that national affairs only need to be done step by step, without the need for any drastic measures, as if saying that the stage of China's industrial revolution can be bypassed. This is really a seemingly correct but actually misleading obstacle to construction, conflicting with Mr. Zhang's creative spirit. In the past and even now, if we talk about construction, industrialization, or agricultural scientification without this creative spirit and iron hand, then there will be numerous obstacles, making it impossible to move forward and making it impossible to talk about starting and developing a business. Mr. Zhang not only started businesses, but also wanted each business to last for a long time, becoming a set of systems and being effective when implemented throughout the country. This spirit of pioneering and establishing traditions, passing it on for thousands of years, has been possessed by Mr. Nantong alone in modern times.

Second, the spirit of learning from others' strengths and doing good to others. Mr. Zhang was an orthodox figure in Confucianism and one of the masters with the deepest foundation in Chinese learning, but Mr. Zhang's philosophy of life and attitude towards learning were very modern and scientific, and could be effectively applied to all matters of helping the world and starting businesses. In order to study Chinese embroidery techniques, he boldly broke through the old etiquette and sought advice from a female newspaper writer, conducting joint research. In order to improve the old opera, he rewarded the old opera industry, spiritual skills, and made it a great success. This is a scientific attitude. As for education and business, he always put others first, followed European and American norms, and established corporate organizations. He did not act independently or selfishly monopolize, but gathered human and material resources from all over the country to jointly initiate and operate. This attitude and spirit of being kind to others, learning from others' strengths, constantly innovating, and striving for excellence is forever worthy of emulation by future generations.

Third, the spirit of valuing substance and rejecting extravagance, discarding falsehood and upholding simplicity. Mr. Zhang's main points for running education were to discuss less, read more, learn to be quiet, and remove agitation. The school mottoes he wrote for various schools were: "Strive for excellence," "Be loyal and honest," "Be focused and dedicated," and "Be diligent, thrifty, and simple." The education Mr. Zhang ran was for agriculture, textiles, water conservancy, veterinary medicine, female workers, the blind and deaf, and sericulture. The industries Mr. Zhang advocated were also like the various educational undertakings he founded. The promotion of this spirit of valuing substance and rejecting extravagance, and the transformation of the atmosphere of discarding falsehood and upholding simplicity, were truly a good medicine for a country and society that had been weak and chaotic for a long time. It is a pity that he spent more time as a private citizen and less time in power, so Hu Shi called him a failed hero. In fact, the inspiration and encouragement of this spirit has not declined for a long time. To this day, the successors of various businesses in Nantong have adhered to it unremittingly. How can it be said that it has not been successful, and how can it be said that it is not a greater and longer success?

Fourth, building the foundation and saving the countryside at the same time. Since ancient times, Chinese patriots have often held two different views on national affairs: one is to advocate first focusing on political construction, and then on education and economic construction; the other is to advocate only engaging in people's livelihood construction, gradually progressing to political construction. Mr. Nantong did not lean towards either of these two views. He advocated focusing on people's livelihood construction, but if there was a need to take the path of political construction first in the course of people's livelihood construction, then it would be okay to try it first. However, he also discovered a new path, which is to build the country from the construction of the countryside. Many people have followed this path later, and Mr. Nantong was the first to discover it. Although the political system was not on the right track and people's livelihood became increasingly dilapidated, merely creating a "Peach Blossom Spring" could not change the overall situation of the Five Dynasties and Sixteen Kingdoms. Therefore, on the surface, it seems that he did not achieve much. However, a society and politics that is like an inverted pagoda, top-heavy, cannot last or stand firm no matter what. In the future, we still need to follow the path discovered by Mr. Zhang in order to have a future. This is another conclusion that can be drawn. The seeds of building the countryside and the country have already been painstakingly sown by Mr. Zhang in those years, and sooner or later they will blossom and bear fruit on this fertile land of China for the enjoyment of our compatriots.

In short, the present era, on the one hand, is more advanced than the period in which Mr. Zhang lived, but on the other hand, its chaos and urgency are even greater than in Mr. Nantong's time. Mr. Zhang in his time had already done his best in his career, knowing that it was impossible but still doing it, greatly influencing society, contributing to the era, and benefiting the country. If successors can truly follow Mr. Zhang's career and spiritual path forward, I firmly believe that the present era and country still have plenty of room for heroes to use their abilities, and every place in China, a country with vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population, can become Nantong. What is lacking and needed is only Mr. Nantong's aspirations and spirit.

### "How to Write"?

— Xie Bingying

Often many young friends who love literature and art write to me, or run to my home to ask me a question that seems very troublesome, but is actually very simple: that is, "How to write"?

There are already many books on the subject of writing guidance on the book stalls. I don't want to repeat what others have said again. Here, I just want to tell young friends that there are a few basic understandings that should be had for literary writing.

If you always complain that your writing is not good, this is wrong, because you must not have asked yourself very rationally and calmly:

(1) Do I have the ability to write?

(2) Do I know what's wrong with my writing?

(3) Is my writing bad because of innate stupidity? Or is it because I haven't read enough books? Have I written too few articles?

(4) Do I like to revise my articles?

(5) Am I willing to humbly accept criticism from others?

(6) If I submit an article to a certain newspaper or magazine and it is not published, do I complain about the editor, or do I complain about my own article?

(7) Before I write, do I spend a lot of time thinking? Do I first prepare the subject matter in my mind before writing?

(8) Is this subject matter the one I am most familiar with?

(9) Is the motivation for writing this article for submission? Or to practice my writing? Or is it for pleasure?

(10) If I submit an article to an editor, and it is not published several times, am I discouraged? Or do I continue to write with perseverance?

Young friends, I know, you will answer these ten questions well and sincerely. You certainly do not admit that you do not have the ability to write, nor can you see the faults in your articles. Perhaps you do not admit that your articles are bad, and suspect that these editors are prejudiced and unwilling to publish articles submitted by an unfamiliar young person. In fact, that kind of editor should no longer exist in modern times. If there is one, he is simply not worthy of being an editor. The reason why a work is not published is that limited space means that not every article can be published. Poor writing and unsuitable content are also reasons. Also, editors have their own personalities. Some value form, and some value content. Those who value form will publish your article as long as your writing is beautiful, regardless of whether the content is empty or not. Those who value content will publish your article as long as the subject matter of this novel or poem is good, the story is touching, and the ideas are correct, even if the writing is a little lacking. When you submit an article, if you encounter someone who values form, and you happen not to pay attention to form, then naturally he will not publish your article. When you encounter that kind of thing, you must not be angry, but humbly reflect on what is wrong with my article. I should carefully reread and revise it. If you can send this article to a teacher or a few friends to see and listen to their criticisms, this will be more practical and useful to you than reading several books on creative methods.

Before you write, you must choose a subject matter that you are most familiar with, and review the characters in the novel in your mind several times. You must make the characters in the novel come alive before your eyes, not only to see their faces clearly, but also to hear their voices clearly. You must fully understand their personalities, their thoughts, and their living habits. As for the relationships or entanglements between them, you should write them down as if you saw them with your own eyes. Do not write too exaggeratedly, do not write too excessively, but follow human nature and be reasonable, and make the reader feel that the novel is real, and that the people are real. Even if the characters in your novel are completely imaginary, you must write them as if they really exist, and that this person is a typical figure of a certain class in society. We often encounter them unknowingly; but we do not know their actual living conditions, nor do we know that their lives are so difficult, and their spirits are so painful. You write them so vividly and so realistically, and your writing skills, needless to say, have already reached a mature stage at this time. But how can you reach a mature stage? That all depends on your own efforts.

A painter does not know how many revisions it takes to write a beautiful picture. A farmer must have at least several years of farming experience to know when to plant what kind of seeds; what kind of soil is suitable for planting what. A composer does not know how many times he has to try to sing, how many times he has to correct, to make a successful song. Can writing an article become famous without many revisions and without a long period of learning? Even if they are special geniuses, they are strict and diligent in the learning process. They did not expect to become famous by chance, but the facts made him get unexpected rewards. Many people gave him the beautiful name of a writer. In fact, what is so rare about a writer? What is so proud about? Isn't he the same as an ordinary person? The difference is that his sensitivity is especially fast, he is especially rich in sympathy, justice, his vision is sharper than ordinary people, and his mind is more complex than ordinary people. He wants to shout for those unfortunate people, to vent their sorrows, troubles, miseries, and misfortunes; and these sorrows, sufferings, miseries, and misfortunes, are what many people want to write but cannot write; what many people want to know but do not know. So our writer writes all these things completely. He brings out the reader's tears, awakens the reader's sympathy; he grabs the reader, controls the reader; he can make the reader cry, and he can also make the reader laugh; he can make the reader sleepless, and he can also make the reader jump up with excitement. This is the power of literature, and also the success of the writer! Also, dear young friends, patience and perseverance are the keys to literary success. If you don't write more and revise more, your articles will never be good. If you want to ask me: "How can I make my articles good"? I only have a very simple answer: "Write more, revise more, and learn more"!

There is still more to say about this topic, I will write about it again when I have time.

### "Pu Feng" and Pu Feng

— Ren Jun

A few days ago, I saw a piece of news in the newspaper, the general idea of which is this:

A certain young man (pen name Pu Feng), who usually writes articles for the Central Daily News and the former Qianjiang Daily News supplements, because of the poverty of his life, carried a pistol one day and carried out a robbery on the street. He was arrested by the police and sent to the court. He confessed without denial, and was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the court, etc....

At this time and place, things like carrying a gun and robbing people are already close to dog bites, and they are not considered "news"; however, it finally attracted people's attention--at least the attention of some people. The reason is probably due to the general people--especially friends in the literary world and general literary youth--cannot help but feel the feeling of "the end of the literati"?

As for me and some friends who write poetry, in addition to this, we cannot help but be attracted by the pen name "Pu Feng".

Probably people who have paid some attention to the poetry of the Anti-Japanese War and before--especially before the war--will not fail to know that there was a poet "Pu Feng" in the new poetry world of those years, right? Because he not only published many poems in various literary and artistic publications at that time, but also published several collections of long and short poems, such as "Vast Night", "June Fiery Fire", "Life", "Poor Bug", "Under the Banner of the Anti-Japanese War"...etc.

Because of this reason, readers of this kind must inevitably have such a question when they see this news: Is this "Pu Feng" the same Pu Feng who wrote poetry?…

The motive for me to write this short article is precisely to answer this question.

First of all, I want to tell you exactly: This "Pu Feng" is definitely not the poet Pu Feng.

Because the poet Pu Feng died of illness in the enemy's rear in Jiangnan during the Anti-Japanese War. How can a person who has been dead for several years suddenly come back to life and carry out a robbery?

Therefore, obviously, this "Pu Feng" who robs people, although he is also a person who writes articles, is definitely not the poet Pu Feng of those years.

The author and the late poet Pu Feng have a small hometown friendship, and later there were many times when they were often together, so they know everything about him in more detail; therefore, after seeing this news, I deeply feel that it is necessary to correct it on behalf of the dead. Because in the current social situation, being able to have the courage to be a robber may even be something to be envied; however, since the matter was not done by a deceased friend, it is not convenient to "take credit", so I have to make a correction and statement on his behalf.

Finally, I, the author, also have a point of feeling, that is: in the literary world, people using the same pen name are often found. And this situation seems to be divided into intentional and accidental. If it is due to accidental coincidence, there is nothing to criticize, but for the convenience of each other, it is still best to change it as soon as possible, so as not to develop into a double-bag case that makes people laugh and cry in various situations. If the matter is intentional, then no matter what the motive, it is not worth emulating! Such as the pen name "Lu Xun", although as far as I know, Mr. Zhou Shuren did not register a patent with the Ministry of the Interior that day, but when a young man "Lu Xun" was also discovered in Hangzhou, then no matter what, we would not suspect that Mr. Zhou was "fake", right?…

### Fragments of Words Life

— Qingguo

Life is a real song, it should be sung loudly and brightly.

Don't say it's bitter, don't say it's sad; it's originally fragrant and happy.

It's spring, the mountains and forests are green, and the river is green. And your grass-green scout uniform? Are you going out?

Look, the sun is smiling. Let the sun shine on your moldy grass-green scout uniform.

Come out, it's so fresh and wide outside! Your song can definitely be sung better.

Childhood

Is it true that childhood is golden days?

Cherish it, know how to cherish the life you grew up from golden days.

Children have the most dreams, may your dreams have a pair of transparent翹, carrying life, flying freely in the blue sky.

But don't fall down, don't be like a kite floating in the spring, greedy for the east wind, and finally falling on the young branches or the laughing river.

You are healthy. Happiness will always point you in the direction.

Night

Night, white night, like a desolate white desert night.

Now, I am still carrying green hopes; tracking sparse and blurred footprints, trekking in the vast desert of the world.

When, oh when, can I get to the oasis?

More miserable than camel bells, I am constantly shaking my bells. Really lonely, this thin and thirsty place. …

Song

Song, red song, like a burning red flame song.

The song burns me, burns the night, burns the dancers in the night.

However, not long after, the singing stopped.

I painfully and silently put life on my own heartstrings.

Who else can listen to a little bit of my voice?…

May the wind and sand be thicker! May the song be buried inside!

### Katie's Letter

— Haynes King

Since the seventeenth century, there has been a school of painters whose works are exclusively focused on the interior of village houses. Their paintings are mostly small and depict a story. "Katie's Letter" is a representative work of this kind of painting. The author was born in Barbados in 1831 and died in 1904. He went to Lei's School in England at a young age, and began to exhibit his works at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1855. The size of the screens of his lifetime works did not exceed the size of a box.

### Titled Yufeng Using Meng Jiao's Rhyme

— Gu Yiqiao

A shooting star fell at night, and the traveling clouds rested on the stone bed; the peaks were towering and the writing brushes stood upright, and the lakes were green and the wild flowers were fragrant; a solitary crane came from the sky, and a solitary sail connected to the water; at the dangerous pavilion, I couldn't bear to talk about the old battlefield!

After ten years of long march, the atmosphere of the Three Wu has not been swallowed; the books left the yellow stone clogs, and the mountains embraced the white cloud roots; the trees on the top of the Qin Pagoda Peak, the villages on the water of Qiandun; the noble style hangs down for thousands of generations, opening and continuing the gate of great achievement.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 331

— Ye Jingfeng

Volume One: Seven Secret Letters, Chapter Nine: Perilous Journey

Summary of Previous Events

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, millions of brave and patriotic sons and daughters of China shed their bright red blood across every inch of our land to defend the motherland. I am collecting these tragic stories to commemorate the arduous task of recovering lost territories. (However, mere commemoration is not enough! Only two years have passed since the victory, old wounds remain untreated, and new ones increase daily; therefore, besides commemorating our comrades who have sacrificed themselves, we must also be thoroughly vigilant, firmly guard our positions, recognize the enemy, and when the time comes, be prepared to shed our last drop of blood, vowing to fight this even more poisonous enemy.)

First Story: "Seven Secret Letters" - Records the agreement between Japanese pirates and the leaders of other countries to prepare for the outbreak of World War II. Tsurumi Tama (Gu Cheng Zhi) was dissatisfied with the Japanese pirates' burning, killing, looting, and poisoning policies. At the same time, he discovered that he was originally a descendant of the old revolutionary Gu Ji Han, so he used his position in the Japanese Imperial Army General Staff as cover, gathered comrades in secret, set up twelve secret radio stations, and risked his life to participate in the Black Dragon Society, wanting to expose these "Seven Secret Letters" and attempt to save humanity from the great calamity.

The first search for the secret letters was unsuccessful; He encountered the mysterious female spy Nakamura Heiko, and the two cooperated, risking their lives to destroy the war demon's "Eight Secrets" within forty-eight hours. However, another female comrade of Tsurumi's, Ji Qun, was unable to participate in this action, feeling lonely, so she bravely set out, went to Guanwai, gathered comrades, and opened up another route to track down the spy group that had infiltrated the Northwest, giving them a blow.

On August 1st, Tsurumi and Heiko settled things in Shanghai. Heiko answered a summons, boarded a ship and returned directly to her country, and Tsurumi also rushed to Beiping after receiving my secret telegram.

Originally, a week ago, we had completely arranged the problem of the transplant station, and I only needed to lead my subordinates along the Ping Sui Line to Datong, and then transfer to Taiyuan, without any twists and turns. Part of Ji Qun's group also decided to return to Pan Yi's group on the day Tsurumi set off for Shanghai, to increase their strength and then rush to Taiyuan. All actions and supply items were planned in detail.

However, on the second day of finalizing the plan (July 31st), the situation in Pingjin changed too much. At the same time, we received urgent intelligence from Tokyo "012" and Panyang "02", knowing that the North China Army Department, in order to respond to the "Eight Secrets" campaign, was also preparing for a shocking performance, and Songbu Doihara simultaneously launched a movement to reorganize the intelligence network. Because of the support of the Black Dragon Society's executive cadres, Doihara actually declared arrogantly: "Regardless of whether the superiors allow it or not, I would rather sacrifice my own authority to achieve my goal!" The main focus of this goal is on the communications department of the intelligence network. In other words, he wants to cancel Tsurumi's position.

On August 1st and 2nd, I and Mr. W discussed many plans, but none were decided. On the 3rd and 4th, Tsurumi returned to Beiping and also discussed several practical methods with us in detail; At the same time, he issued several confidential deployment instructions to "012" and "02"; waiting for a reply, we would launch a counterattack according to the plan. Little did we know that before these two replies arrived, Konoe had a clear telegram, conveyed by Matsui to Tsurumi, summoning him back to the country for "training for a week" - W also received urgent reports from "012", "02", etc., conveyed by Tsurumi, "The atmosphere is bad, return to the country quickly to make arrangements; Although the previous instructions were followed, due to new sudden changes, I am afraid there will be no practical benefit."

Troubles, either don't come; when they come, they always come one after another. This can also be applied to the old saying: "Good fortune never comes in pairs, misfortune never comes singly!"

The second shocking news was also received by Mr. W's headquarters; "Ping Zhuan, Tsurumi Tama Sama: Brother Tama - Nakamura Heiko, was suddenly detained due to the Shanghai case in China, and is under house arrest, waiting for Brother Tama to return to Kyoto to prove her innocence, or she may be able to clear up the dispute. Liu Shi urgently reports."

There was also an even more terrible message, delivered from Tianjin, which was a secret distress telegram: - The secret general station of the anti-conspiracy organization in Tianjin was broken by Japanese secret agents; Most of the important personnel were captured. Yaoqun returned to Ping from Shenyang, passing through Tianjin, and is suspected of rescuing comrades, and is said to have been detained by the Japanese. Xiao Hucheng (Little Tiger) has now fled, the Japanese are searching very urgently, and the Tianjin puppet police are identifying him as a "child demon" and are offering a reward for his capture.

Announcement - The remaining two drafts of this volume, "Seven Secret Letters", will be published, and a separate edition will be published immediately. Volume Two, "Outpost No. 12" may also be published at the same time. Thank you to the readers for your inquiries, this is to inform you... Also, a few weeks ago, several family members suffered from dangerous illnesses, and the school was also holding final exams at the end of the semester. My body and mind were exhausted, and I was unable to proofread, resulting in an interruption of two weeks. Now that the final exams are over and the sick have escaped danger and are recovering, I sincerely apologize to all the readers - the author)

Dream

Dream, a blue dream, like a dream of a vast blue sky.

Bright stars twinkling in the blue sky.

Smart people say: The stars in the sky are the good people on earth.

And when the stars have fallen completely, dawn is near.

But, is it true that when the good people have almost all died, the ideal is near?

There are so many stars tonight, the sky seems extra blue. The night is also very deep...

### Occasional Notes on Reading Poetry

— Zhu Wen

There have been many commentators on Du Fu's poetry since ancient times, but Zheng Shanfu is the most pertinent in pointing out the flaws and shortcomings. Shanfu said: "The beauty of poetry lies in not having to say everything, not having to write everything as true, and what one wants to say and write is naturally conceivable, although it is conceivable but cannot be expressed, this is how one obtains the meaning of Feng Ren. Du Fu often goes to the point of truth and completeness, so he loses it." He also said: "Long poems are profound and eloquent, describing events and expressing emotions, with roots, joints, and bones. This is Du Fu's unique ability, and all the Tang people are inferior to him. However, poetry is not valued for this, but it can only be considered difficult. The Song people learned from him, often turning prose into poetry, and the elegant way was greatly damaged, starting from Du Fu." His arguments are so precise!

### Random Chat by Du Bo

— Wang Cong

The most unfortunate thing in the world is that the object of your love is an abuser of love. An abuser's love is like counterfeit money. It cannot alleviate the poverty of the recipient, but it can make the recipient angry because he feels cheated.

Recently, I reread Bedier's Tristan and Isolde. Since Christianity spread to Europe, this is the first passionate and poignant love story. Just as Mr. Zhu Mengshi said, we can see from it that the poets of the Middle Ages hid their firm courage behind their cowardly faces. This story has won countless people's tears because what it expresses is not abuse of love - single-minded love is more valuable than gold.

If not insult, then indignation.

Samuel Foote said: "White horses and beautiful women are similar, both old ones are difficult-to-manage troublesome things. The former is difficult to keep clean; the latter, although kept clean."

Perhaps he said this with feeling! I think this sentence should be applied to the Mississippian who uses Cui towel countries to eat appropriately. This kind of easily soiled beautiful woman will never have a feeling of love. What she calls love is just a misinterpretation of carnal desire.

Selfish and vulgar "love" is like a dog. What it chases, and what it soils the most, is the person it "loves" the most. Who says that true love can grow in selfish soil? Love is giving, not getting; love is a burden, not a venting.

Christ was willing to carry the cross, so he could achieve his great love. We are too lacking in love that carries the cross in this utilitarian, dog-eat-dog society.

Jealousy and selfishness are sisters. Being jealous of the happiness of the person you love is a shame. Secretly watching the person you deeply love go and kiss someone who is more expensive than you, and stubbornly and selfishly destroying the other person's happiness, is simply an unavoidable insult.

### Remembering the 74th Reorganized Division

— A Bing

The 74th Reorganized Division, which was gloriously martyred in the Yimeng Mountain area this time, was formerly the 74th Army, which was famous throughout the country and transferred to Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. I remember when I joined the army in Changde, Hunan, in May of the 27th year of the Republic, I was assigned to the 58th Division under that army. At that time, the army commander was General Yu Jishi, and the deputy army commander was General Wang Yaowu, the current chairman of the Shandong Province. The commander of the 58th Division was General Feng Shengfa, and the brigade commander was General Lao Guanying. Brigade Commander Lao distinguished himself in the Battle of Mahui in Jiangxi. In the future, when compiling the history of the war, I am afraid his name will be indispensable.

In the spring of the 28th year, we went from Yuanling, Hunan, to Xiangyin. Suddenly, we heard that Commander Yu would come to inspect the team the next day. So we were ordered to cut our hair overnight. Xiangyin County is small, there are very few barbershops, and we soldiers have many comrades. Even the small apprentices in the barbershop had to be mobilized to serve us. The small apprentice held a mirror-like bayonet, shaving us like planing a gourd. Some places were left with a piece, and some places were scraped off the skin. The suffering was definitely not something that the wealthy and noble people sitting in first-class barbershops today could imagine.

In the winter of the 28th year, Commander Yu was ordered to transfer to the 86th Army in Zhejiang. Our division commander, Feng Shengfa, was also transferred to Zhejiang. General Yu Yaowu was promoted to army commander at this time, and General Chen Shizheng was transferred from Fenghua to succeed him as the commander of the 58th Division. However, his term of office was only five months, and during these five months, he participated in the Battle of Northern Jiangxi and the First Battle of Changsha, so there was no day of leisure. General Chen can also be said to have had a hard life. After Chen was dismissed, Deputy Division Commander Liao Lingqi was promoted to the position. Liao was from Qiyang, Hunan, a fourth-term student of the military academy. Although he was a military man, he was a big, fat man with a big belly, and he was also strict in governing the army. There was also a special feature, that is, his personal letters were mostly replied to by himself. I was working in the adjutant's office at the time, and I often saw his handwritten letters sent to the general post office for mailing, so Liao's subordinates were very fond of him. Unfortunately, during the Second Battle of Changsha in the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic, he was executed by firing squad in the Hengyang Garden for delaying military affairs.

The one who succeeded Liao was General Zhang Lingfu, who was martyred this time. General Zhang was originally Liao's deputy division commander. When the Battle of Changsha was lost, the troops lost contact and retreated to Hengyang. General Zhang was promoted for his meritorious service in accommodating the retreating soldiers, so he was not only not punished, but also promoted. This was also unexpected at first. Also, General Cai Renjie, the deputy division commander who was martyred this time, was only a regimental commander at that time. It was not until the first half of the 34th year that General Wang Yaowu was ordered to be promoted to the commander of the Fourth Front Army, and General Shi Zhongcheng, the commander of the 57th Division, was transferred to succeed him as the army commander. Later, Shi was transferred again. According to his merits, General Zhang succeeded him. After the reorganization, he was re-elected as the division commander until his martyrdom in Yimeng Mountain. The entire 74th Reorganized Army was gloriously martyred before the end was announced.

After this, I don't know who will receive this honorary designation? Recalling that the 74th Army was established in the early days of the War of Resistance, its strict military discipline has long been praised by people all over the country, and its glorious achievements will be eternally recorded in history books. We were one of its members when it was first established, climbing thousands of mountains and wading through thousands of rivers for three or four years. Now, hearing this bad news, I cannot help but feel sad. I would like to sincerely pay my respects to all the officers and soldiers of the 74th Army, and to my classmates and friends at that time.

### Summer Vacation Plan

— Xie Zhangtao

The summer vacation has begun, and a series of long summer days are waiting to be spent. Perhaps many people have plans and have formulated forms, etc., waiting to be realized. However, because of the monotonous life and heavy courses of the past semester, the tense and tired bodies and minds will throw these planned forms to the back of their minds when they get into the relaxed atmosphere of the vacation; The result is sleeping, chatting, strolling in the park, wandering on the road, and spending the summer in a daze. I remember at a Saturday discussion held by the public rescue team, I proposed the topic of "How to Spend the Summer Vacation", and in order to prepare for my speech, I had the following prejudices, which may resonate with some people!

During the summer vacation, one should learn some life-necessary skills, such as swimming, first aid (artificial respiration, hemostasis, simple bandaging, etc.), horseback riding, tree climbing (mountain climbing, rope climbing, etc.), shooting, rowing, etc. Learning these skills may be very expensive, or you may not be able to learn them in the city, or it may take a long time, but the money and time you spend will never be wasted, or you will get ten times or a hundred times the return, or even save your most precious life, which is also the highest return for learning these skills. In your long life history, these skills may have a decisive role in distinguishing between life and death in times of crisis. Taking swimming as an example, recently there have been repeated reports of maritime shipping accidents, only to see dozens or hundreds of people drowning, but there have been no examples like in Europe and the United States of people struggling in the sea for several hours, or grabbing onto floating objects and floating for dozens of hours and being rescued. This is clear evidence that the people of our country have not learned to swim and have neglected life-saving techniques. Also, with first aid methods, whether it is artificial respiration, hemostasis, or simple bandaging, they can show great effectiveness in times of crisis. Sometimes, without preliminary first aid, even with a doctor's diagnosis and treatment and surgery, it is difficult to save the situation.

In the process of one's life, one cannot absolutely avoid the occurrence of accidents and crises. Learning these necessary skills is really a good way to prepare for a rainy day!

### The Strange Effect of Color

— Guo Yongnian

Since Newton discovered the seven-color light band by observing with a prism, the world has long understood the basic principles of color. In practical applications, people have always only used different colors from an aesthetic point of view; Selecting colors using scientific methods to achieve certain special effects has only been a matter of recent years. The following facts may be used as a reference for us:

An American Chicago cheese factory specially painted a large piece of glass window in the factory building blue. The outside of the window was no longer crowded with flies, while the outside of the other glass was still densely covered with thick swarms of flies. So blue is the color to repel flies. In the United States, there are also deep orange-yellow electric lights specially used to repel mosquitoes.

A large hotel in New York with light green interior walls had good business, but the manager complained that customers stayed in the store for too long. After being instructed by a color expert, the walls were repainted with alternating red and yellow colors, and the turnover of customers accelerated, increasing profits by 50%.

In a factory in the western United States, the temperature inside the factory building was constantly maintained at 72 degrees, but the female workers often complained to the factory that they felt cold. The factory owner ordered that a part of the sunlight be blocked with a blue glass recently. Inadvertently, he discovered that repainting the entire blue-green wall coral-colored would eliminate the workers' complaints of coldness.

When the workers in another factory were carrying black metal boxes filled with cigarette holders, they often complained of back pain. Later, when the boxes were repainted light green, some workers claimed that the boxes were much lighter than before.

Using the simple principle that white leather reflects heat and black absorbs heat, a packing company in New York painted its roof white in the spring, and the temperature in the hot summer was several degrees lower. In the winter, it was repainted black to absorb heat. The craftsmen who installed the water radiators discovered that the heat generated by the fifth gear of a white water radiator was the same as the sixth gear of a gilded or black water radiator.

Uncoordinated colors can injure the eyes, causing fatigue and nervous tension. In a textile factory in Caroline, female workers who specialized in inspecting the weave of twill fabrics often had to look up at the white walls to rest because the fabric was green and rotating very quickly. At this time, the white wall appeared peach-colored in their eyes. When they lowered their heads to work again, it took several seconds to recover their vision. After research by the factory's engineers, the white walls were repainted pinkish-peach, and the working efficiency was greatly increased.

The Scripps Institution of Oceanography has discovered that a large number of small crustaceans attached to the hulls of ships and called "barnacles" like dark colors the most. If the underwater hull is repainted light green or white, this type of annoying dirt can be greatly reduced. This simple invention has already saved the US shipping industry $100 million annually in "barnacle removal" costs!

Due to the experience gained during the war, the American industry knows that fully colorized factories can increase production by 15% to 30%, so thousands of factories have adopted new color methods. Nowadays, the machine bodies of standard iron factories are painted light gray, and the working parts are painted cream-colored, making them stand out from the machine body; the ceilings are painted white; the walls and pillars are painted gray-green below eight feet; the floors are painted light yellow or gray; the fire-fighting equipment is red; the rescue supplies are green; dangerous objects such as low beams, edges of platforms and low holes, crane hooks and cargo cars are painted with yellow stripes on a black background. Such color distribution looks very harmonious and pleasing to the eye, but it has nothing to do with art, and is completely designed for function. According to reports from various factories that have adopted the above colors, the brightness of the factory building can be increased by one time; the accuracy of work can be increased by 40%; workers' unauthorized absence from their posts can be reduced by 60%; the occurrence of accidents can be reduced by 20% to 40%; the value of the reduction in the loss of parts discarded on the ground can offset all the paint modification costs in two months.

### American Miscellany

— Popular Songs in America

"Singing and dancing in peace and prosperity" - only America deserves to be described in this way. Almost everyone who has an interest in literature and art can casually write a few poems and compose a few songs. Female composers are as numerous as carps crossing the river. They participate in the Xiaoshi Dun Pen Club and the Writers Association, which hold weekly meetings to select songs. If the material is novel and the citizens like to sing it, it becomes a popular song Hit parade. Many popular songs are published every week, most of which are adopted by film companies and recorded. Songs that were popular in the United States five years ago are now popular in Shanghai dance halls. The lifespan of popular songs in the United States is very short, and on average, no one sings them after less than a year. Some popular songs are really vulgar and unbearable, like Pistol Packing Mama, which can be said to be worthless. It was popular in the southern provinces. Not only Americans sing it, but also students studying in the United States. The women in the southern United States wear cowboy clothes, leather vests, short tassel skirts, wide-brimmed hats, and half-high boots, and carry guns. That kind of dress is more heroic than the Thirteenth Sister. We weak scholars cannot help but take three steps back when we see them. There are good works in popular songs, for example, the one sung by Joan Leslie at the Hollywood Center (I don't know the Chinese translation) is unprecedented. However, a good song still needs a beautiful woman to sing it. Joan Leslie sings it so round and graceful, but if you change to another person, it will be boring. Recently, some people in Shanghai have followed suit, but their English pronunciation is inaccurate and the tune is a bit like Shanghai Opera. It's neither Chinese nor Western, and it makes my skin crawl. It's really uncomfortable.

### "Fragrant Name Everywhere in Bricks"

— Ma Gao

Like the author's other adapted plays, the dialogue is smooth and fluent, the structure is concise and clear, and the characters are economical. It is a so-called comedy, but they are equally uninteresting to us. I always feel that this type of work is empty on the surface and lacks content, giving the audience what? Besides a burst of laughter, there is a feeling of emptiness.

As the theme of this play, the "teaching" of a soap industry tycoon, leading a纨绔子弟 from a wandering and dissipated habit to the right path, then what method does he use? What path does his son take after being stimulated? What is shown here is the vast magical power of the "bad Shanghai School", the fluke success of empty-handed scams, and the Yangchang habits that are close to hooliganism. Therefore, the answers to many questions are too skillful, making people dare not believe them: just imagine a company that only has advertisements flying all over the sky and only four soap samples in the office, how can it... In short, there are too many doubts in this play.

Moreover, the industrialist's scene is written too smoothly. At this moment, serious industrialists who are engaged in real production are probably unable to breathe under the squeeze of high interest rates. It is a pity that the author does not use his pen to describe the real situation.

The director is also the author, so it is naturally convenient to be familiar with the road. Therefore, the performance is very appropriate, and the handling of the atmosphere and rhythm is fast and neat.

Today, when it is difficult to perform dramas, and there is this good opportunity to gather so many excellent actors, why not choose a play with more realistic significance to perform? And it only takes six days to rush out the play, which is simply sloppy and wasteful. Friends who are engaged in supporting the drama movement should always be vigilant and not let commercial interests infiltrate our hearts too much. Over time, the misfortune of being spurned by the masses will be inevitable.

### On the National Education Classes in This City

— Chen Rongjie

"National Education Class" is an abbreviation for "National Education Training Class," encompassing both children and adults. This name only began to be noticed around two years ago. In other words, the National Education Class has been implemented for less than two years; its history is quite short.

The Education Bureau has put in a lot of effort to organize the National Education Classes, finally coming up with this approach. To promote universal education, the city schools could not temporarily accommodate so many out-of-school citizens, so they borrowed classrooms from private schools, using the spare time and facilities in the afternoon to establish some small-scale municipal national schools. We do not deny, nor do we erase, the achievements of the National Education Classes since their implementation. Many out-of-school children wandering the streets, as well as amateur adults, have the opportunity to enroll. However, with advantages come disadvantages, especially for the National Education Classes, which are not yet fully organized and are like orphans without anyone to care for them. Their growth inevitably has many shortcomings.

Calling the National Education Classes "orphans" is not an overstatement. They have never been urged or cared for. In theory, they are so-called small-scale national schools, and everything should be the responsibility of the Education Bureau, but in reality, the Education Bureau's reach is insufficient. There is simply no way to manage them. The principals of private schools also feel a headache about these and are unwilling to take on the extra duties. Thus, these miserable "orphans" grow on their own without any supervision, and many problems inevitably arise.

Seeing that this term's National Education Classes are coming to an end, the next term's implementation is undoubtedly certain. It is hoped that the Education Bureau can have more comprehensive measures to eliminate the past flaws of insufficient enrollment, insufficient time, insufficient subjects, and insufficient training, and truly complete the rescue mission.

### The Science of Dreams (Part 2)

— Gu Junzheng

What is a Nightmare?

According to surveys, one in five people has experienced a nightmare, and only one in three dreams is entirely pleasant. Many authorities believe that nightmares are a manifestation of a very serious inner conflict and are the most important form of dreams because they stimulate the most intense psychological activity that can exist during sleep. According to reports from authorities, some people have died from nightmares due to high blood pressure or heart disease.

Do Dreams Have Any Meaning?

Dreams have very important meanings. Authorities have found that dreams not only show your daytime thoughts and actions but also reveal your personality. However, dreams cannot be interpreted literally. In fact, all dreams are symbolic—their true meaning is hidden in a metaphor or pure fantasy.

When the conscious mind constantly examines the subconscious mind, the subconscious disguises its true state as symbolic images to deceive the examiner. Most authorities believe that the examiner's cautious attitude is due to the following two reasons: (1) Humanity has an innate and inexplicable fear of the unknown; (2) Fear of revealing secrets, which would damage the dignity of the self?

Do Everyone Use the Same Symbols in Dreams?

Some symbols come entirely from past experiences. For example, if a child has been injured by a car, then dreaming of a car may symbolize pain or physical trauma; if the child has traveled in a car on holiday, then dreaming of a car may symbolize freedom or escape from the constraints of daily life.

However, some symbols appear repeatedly in everyone's dreams and have a basic or general meaning. It is common for the father to be symbolized as a king, teacher, God, or police officer, and the mother to be symbolized as a queen, land, or even someone else's mother. These and similar basic symbols are deeply rooted in the human subconscious and can be traced back to the symbolic hieroglyphs of primitive people. However, even these basic symbols often change with individual experiences, and no symbol has the same meaning for everyone.
