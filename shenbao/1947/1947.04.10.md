### The Curtain Rises on the Great Battle of Southern Shanxi: Quwo and Jishan Under Siege; Nationalist Forces From Northern Shaanxi to Join Forces

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] Taiyuan Report: The Communist forces in Southern Shanxi have launched a full-scale offensive, making a major battle inevitable. The future campaign in Southern Shanxi will likely occur near Yuncheng. After the Communist forces successively captured Jicheng, Houma, Xinjiang, and other places, they besieged Quwo. Fierce fighting is now taking place in the north and west of the city. Nationalist forces are bravely resisting, but the Communist forces have not yet succeeded. Mengcheng, a town belonging to Quwo, is also under siege. At the same time, fighting has also begun in Wenxi. At dawn on the 8th, Jishan and Hejin counties were also besieged by four regiments of Communist forces, and fierce fighting is underway.

[Central News Agency, Ningxia, 9th] The Nationalist forces that recovered Anbian continued to clear out the remaining Communist forces in the vicinity on the 9th. The 90-li transportation route from Anbian to Dingbian has now been completely restored.

[Our Yan'an Dispatch, 8th] Commander Hu Zongnan hosted a banquet at his military headquarters at 7 PM on the 8th to entertain press delegations from Wuhan and Xi'an. During the banquet, he predicted to reporters that the Communist forces in Northern Shaanxi had lost their will to fight and that Suide could be recovered by the end of this month, and the situation in Northern Shaanxi could gradually be clarified by the end of May.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] It is widely rumored here that the Nationalist forces in Northern Shaanxi captured Suide and Mizhi on the 8th. There are also reports of the capture of the northern city of Mizhi (Mizhi has a north and south city, separated by half a li), but these have yet to be confirmed. The battle for the outer strongholds of Suide continues on the 9th. Troops have entered and exited Dahuiping and Guojiawan several times. Another unit of Nationalist forces cut off the Wubu-Suide highway, and the two armies are engaged in a fierce battle on the highway. Several small villages on Jiuli Mountain have been captured by the Nationalist forces. After the Nationalist forces reached the foothills of Beishan from Shizui, the Communist forces launched three counterattacks from Shizui against the Nationalist positions but failed. The Communist forces on the mountain appear to be withdrawing. The joining of the northern and southern Nationalist forces will occur within a few days. The Communist forces continue to cross the Yellow River into Shanxi via Xiliyu, Wanhu Valley, Pantang, and Shaomao Head.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 9th] Several thousand remnants of the Communist 359th Brigade yesterday afternoon fled to Baijiaping and Lijiapo, northwest of Panlong Town. Over five thousand remnants of Wang Zhen's forces fled to Liujiajie. The remnants of the Communist forces on the Shaanxi-Gansu border, in the Fotang and Yangbaotou area south of Zhengning County, led by Communist commander Wang Wenxin, are attempting to collude with the remnants of the "Police Second Regiment" and "Police Third Regiment" hiding in Xunyi's Shimen Pass and Yao County's Zhaojin Town, seeking an opportunity to spy on the north bank of the Jing River.

### Communist Forces in Hebei Besiege Zhengding; Part of the Hutuo River Railway Bridge Destroyed; Nationalist Forces in Northern Henan Approach the Outskirts of Tangyin

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 9th] The flames of war in Rongcheng on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway have barely subsided, and the Communist forces on the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section besieged Zhengding again last night. The fighting is fierce. The defending troops have resolutely resisted for a day and a night. Several strongholds in the suburbs have been captured by the Communist forces. The field army that previously fled to Ding County and Central Hebei has been transferred to reinforce the attack and to prepare for an offensive against Shijiazhuang. The situation in Shijiazhuang is becoming tense. The commanding officer of the defending forces telegraphed the pacification headquarters for emergency assistance at noon on the 9th, but the strength of the Communist forces has not yet been determined.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The Communist forces outside Shijiazhuang, with the aim of destroying the Hutuo River Railway Bridge, launched a fierce attack on the Nationalist strongholds near Shijiazhuang with over 5,000 men last night. The Nationalist positions on the Hutuo River Bridge were attacked simultaneously, and the fighting was very fierce. The sound of gunfire shook Shijiazhuang. Part of the railway bridge was eventually destroyed. Nationalist forces from Shijiazhuang and Zhengding reinforced the area. The Communist forces retreated at 7 AM on the 9th. Train service between Shijiazhuang and Xin'an has been temporarily suspended.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 9th] The Nationalist forces that entered Anxin County had completely occupied Liujiakou, Dayin Town, Zhabankou, and other important points by yesterday, and recovered over 20 villages. They continued to pursue and suppress the remaining Communist forces in the area six kilometers from the city on the 9th.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The rapid units of the Nationalist forces in Northern Henan crossed Hong County on the morning of the 8th and continued to pursue the retreating Communist forces northward.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 9th] The large-scale Nationalist forces in Northern Henan crossed the Hong River on the 9th and approached the outskirts of Tangyin, which is about to be relieved. The main force is now fighting at Caiyuanji, 20 li northeast of Tangyin. According to reports from the front, there are still over 30,000 Communist forces invading Northern Henan, with signs of retreating to Daming in Southern Hebei.

### Li Zongren Returns to Beiping

Talks with Our Newspaper Reporter

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] Li Zongren returned to Beiping from Nanjing on the Zhuiyun (Chasing Clouds) aircraft at 1:30 PM on the 9th. He was accompanied by Hebei Inspector Li Sicong, Hebei Provincial Party Committee Chairman Wang Bingjun, and Su Ting, Director of the Education Department of Hebei Province. Leaders including Sun Lianzhong all went to the airport to welcome him. After returning to his residence, Li met with our newspaper reporter and stated: (1) All the rumors about me outside are inaccurate. I have requested the Chairman's permission to go to the United States for treatment twice due to chronic stomach problems, but both were denied. (2) The reorganization of the government is a major matter and requires detailed discussion, but it has not been stopped. After the reorganization of the government, there will be no changes in the military and political affairs of North China. Rehe has a very close relationship with Beiping in terms of economy and culture, and it is hoped that it will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters. This matter still needs to be decided by the Supreme National Defense Council. (3) The central government is very concerned about North China. The opening of the Tianjin-Pukou and Beiping-Hankou railways is already planned. Materials for the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are being actively prepared. The opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will be carried out simultaneously without waiting for the elimination of the Communist forces in Jiaodong and Southern Shandong. A reporter asked why the Third Plenary Session did not issue a decree to suppress the Chinese Communists. Li replied: Although no decree to suppress them has been issued, it is inevitable to operate when the sore is painful. (4) Hebei will not become a decisive battlefield as speculated outside, because the Communist forces are separated by the Yellow River after it returned to its old course. The situation in Shanxi will not be too serious, because the Nationalist forces in Northern Shaanxi are currently pursuing them into Shanxi.

### Restoration of the Pinggu Road

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The damaged roadbeds of the Pinggu Road in Huairou and Miyun have been repaired. Passenger trains were running to Miyun on the morning of the 9th.

### Minister Peng's Speech

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The Ministry of Information held a press reception tea party at the Lizi Society at 4 PM on the 9th to welcome the Chinese and foreign press delegation that had just returned from inspecting Yan'an. Minister Peng expressed his condolences and answered reporters' questions as follows:

Q: What is the latest situation regarding the reorganization of the government? Please explain the reason for the delay.

Peng: The lists of candidates from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party for the National Government Committee have been internally finalized. They will be decided and announced after the Chairman returns to Nanjing. After the establishment of the National Government Committee, the Executive Yuan will be reorganized. Both the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have decided to participate. The Democratic Socialist Party has stated that it can fill two seats as ministers without portfolio in the Executive Yuan, while the Youth Party has stated that it can hold ministerial positions and ministers without portfolio.

Q: It is rumored that the government will establish a News Bureau under the Executive Yuan. What is the situation?

Peng: It has been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council and is currently drafting an organizational law. The principle is to transfer the functions of the original Ministry of Information that should be handled by the government to the News Bureau. The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense may change its name.

Q: What is the recent military situation?

Peng: (1) The Nationalist forces in the Shandong area recovered the historically famous Mount Tai on April 2. The Communist forces retreated into the Xintai and Mengyin mountain areas. They are experiencing a shortage of food and are very distressed. They are currently collecting food from the civilians in Northern Shandong north of the Yellow River and transporting it south to Xinmeng to meet urgent needs. (2) The Nationalist forces in Northern Shaanxi recovered Wabu, north of Yan'an, on April 3. At the same time, the Nationalist forces in Ningxia reached Anbian Fort after recovering Dingbian County. Qingyang and Heshui in Eastern Gansu were also recovered on the 8th. The area occupied by the Communist forces in Western Shaanxi will be cleared in a short period of time. (3) Liu Bocheng's troops in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border area once harassed the northernmost tip of Henan. Recently, they were defeated and returned to Daming and Puyang in the southernmost tip of Hebei. In short, the future situation of the Communist forces inside the customs is that they will separately flee into the mountain areas of Shandong and Shanxi, encountering difficulties such as transportation difficulties, food shortages, and a sparse population. It is impossible to sustain it for a long time.

Q: What is your impression of Foreign Minister Molotov's response to Secretary of State Marshall's document?

Peng: Regarding the withdrawal of American troops from China, Marshall has spoken in detail. I deeply admire Foreign Minister Molotov's reiteration of the Soviet Union's policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. China's internal affairs do not allow foreign interference, which is the firm position of the Chinese government. Regarding American aid to China, I would like to point out that the aid provided by the United States to China is for the legitimate government of China and not for armed rebels who are disloyal. Aiding the government of an allied nation is beyond reproach. If American aid were given to the rebel army of China, it would definitely not be justified.

The following are the responses to two foreign affairs questions asked by Chinese and foreign reporters by Ye Gongchao, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

Q: Please explain the details of the takeover of Dalian and Lushun.

Ye: The government spokesman stated last Wednesday that China had sent the plan for the takeover of Dalian and Lushun to the Soviet government. We are still waiting for the Soviet reply. I have no other news to report before receiving a reply.

Q: What is the situation regarding China's demand for reparations from Japan?

Ye: China agrees with the US government's proposal to advance the dismantling of a portion of the domestic materials in Japan that can be used for reparations. As you all know, China has not demanded any reparations from Germany or Italy. This decision ensures that the percentage of the early payment from Japan received by China will not affect China's future claims in the overall settlement. China hopes that the US government's proposal can be implemented as soon as possible, at least to avoid the erosion and damage of materials. As for the disposal of Japan's overseas assets, if this matter cannot be resolved satisfactorily before the peace conference, it must be decided at the peace conference.

### The Chairman Will Come to Shanghai to Review the Youth Army

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 9th] Luo Zelian, commander of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in Suzhou, has recently returned to Suzhou from Nanjing. According to him, after paying respects at his ancestral tombs in Fenghua, Chairman Chiang will review the 202nd Division of the Youth Army in Shanghai before returning to Nanjing. At that time, all troops from Suzhou and Wujin, except those on duty, will be required to go to Shanghai for the review.

[Our Xikou Dispatch, 9th] It has been the eighth day of the Chairman and his wife's return home. After resting and having lunch at the Fenghuangshan Villa on the morning of the 9th, they traveled by car to Shanlin Village, ten li from Xiaowang Temple. This is where the Chiang family first settled. There are now only twenty Chiang households. Chairman Chiang's ancestor, Junming Gong, was buried here. He made a special trip to pay respects and present wreaths. Afterwards, he went to Fachang Temple, more than twenty li from Xikou, to sweep the tomb of his sister, Mrs. Zhu Zhishan, Ruilian. In the evening, he went to Ren Song Village for dinner at the home of Chairman Chiang's aunt, Ruichun. In the evening, he returned to Xikou and watched a Peking Opera at the Military Academy at the invitation of the clan elder, and spent the night at the Fenghuangshan Villa.

### China and Outer Mongolia's National Border Will Soon Be Surveyed and Demarcated

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The work of determining the national border between China and Outer Mongolia will begin soon. Those responsible for this work will be the surveying teams of the Ministry of Interior. The surveying work will begin with ground surveys, conducted in stages and sections. Also, the southern section of the China-Burma border can also be surveyed within the year, after the diplomatic negotiations reach a conclusion. According to Fu Jiao, Director of the Department of Local Administration, the Ministry of Interior is drafting a plan for managing border affairs. The preliminary work will begin with cleaning and managing boundary markers, and a national border police force is planned to be formed.

### Shandong Provincial Government Enforces the Order of the Executive Yuan: Protecting Strongholds and Roads; High-Stalk Crops Not Allowed to Be Planted Nearby

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] For the purpose of facilitating the defense and protection of various military strongholds and the safety of railways and highways, the Shandong Provincial Government has received an order from the Executive Yuan that high-stalk crops such as sorghum are not allowed to be planted within ten li on both sides of railways and highways, and two li on both sides of roads in military and political strongholds, counties, and towns. The highway project between Jinan and Jimo has been largely completed. The Shandong Highway Bureau has scheduled a test run next week. The repair of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Xuzhou to Ji'nan has reached Nansha River and Teng County on the 9th, and it is expected to be completed by the end of October this year.

### British Journalists Urge Promoting Sino-British Friendship and Suggesting a Long-Distance Sino-British Flight

[British Information Services, London, 9th] Renowned British journalist Mr. Samson, who visited China last year, recently wrote a long article in the "Manchester Guardian", urging the UK to strengthen daily relations with its Eastern allies. He said that China and the UK have many common interests, and everything that can enhance cultural and commercial ties between the two countries must be done. Although the UK is currently unable to help with huge sums of money or large quantities of machinery and goods, it must be understood that one or two measures at this time will have a significant impact on Sino-British relations than greater efforts in the future. The UK is still very concerned about the fate of China, so a parliamentary delegation will travel to China this autumn. He suggested a long-distance flight from London to Nanjing, which would not only show respect to China but also make British aircraft famous throughout the world. Mr. Samson also praised the work of the British Council, saying that its activities still need to be carefully expanded. What is most important is to instill in the Chinese practical knowledge that is suitable for the local situation. Regarding the transmission of Chinese news to the UK, he said that the biggest obstacle is the high cost of telegraphs, which is almost twice as high as sending telegrams from the UK. A way should be found to remove "this harmful stumbling block" from Nanjing. As for the commercial issues between the two countries, he said that benefits could be gained if a more detailed exploration of barter trade could be carried out. In view of the importance of the Far East, the British government should appoint a junior minister in the Foreign Office to specialize in Far Eastern affairs.

### The Signing Method of the Common Governance Program Has Been Determined; The Lists of the Two Parties Have Not Been Finalized

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party visited Wang Shijie and Zhang Qun at 7:30 AM on the 9th to discuss the signing method of the common governance program. A final decision has not yet been made. The general approach is to exchange letters. The date of the National Political Conference will be decided after the Chairman returns to Nanjing. Zhang Junmai is also scheduled to arrive in Nanjing at that time to attend. At the same time, the lists of the two parties participating in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan will be submitted, and the National Government Committee will be announced. The common governance program will be passed at the first meeting of the newly formed National Government Committee and drafted into law as the sole guideline for the government's governance after the reorganization.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The candidates for the National Government Committee from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have been decided. It is learned that the candidates for ministers without portfolio have also been decided, but the Democratic Socialist Party has decided only to serve as ministers without portfolio and not to participate in ministries. The Youth Party has already been confirmed. Its list of candidates to participate in local governments has also been initially proposed, with ten people being assigned to serve as department heads in various provinces. There are also military personnel who want to participate in military organs. It is said that the government has agreed to the former, while the latter is still under consideration.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Jiang Yuntian told reporters that the government had offered to assign the positions of Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and Minister of Health to members of the Democratic Socialist Party, but Jiang said that the party believes that in order to save national financial expenditures, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should still be merged into the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Health can still operate as the National Health Administration. The Democratic Socialist Party has no intention of participating in the Executive Yuan ministries.

[Our Dispatch] Zuo Shunsheng returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. When asked by reporters what was the reason for the breakdown of negotiations in Nanjing, Zuo said: Although the reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the opening of local governments are difficult, they are not as smooth as imagined; but as far as the Youth Party is concerned, they are not insurmountable. Currently, everything must wait until the Chairman returns to Nanjing before a decision can be made.

### The Democratic Socialist Party Holds a Central Standing Committee Meeting

[Our Dispatch] The Democratic Socialist Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday to discuss participating in the government in detail, but no conclusion was reached. Wu Xianzi decided not to take up the position of National Government Committee member. Who will replace him has not been decided. It is reported that Zhang Junmai advocated only serving as a minister without portfolio in the Executive Yuan without taking actual responsibility; however, this opinion was strongly opposed by the members of the Standing Committee, who believed it was too impractical. Wu Xianzi has expressed his unwillingness to serve as a National Government Committee member and has advocated not participating in the government; a member of the Standing Committee in Shanghai has sent a letter urging him to come to Shanghai for a discussion to exchange views. Li Daming, a representative from Hong Kong, also flew to Honolulu yesterday morning.

### TASS Fabricates Facts, Ministry of Information Refutes

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The spokesman of the Ministry of Information issued a statement at 11 PM on the 9th as follows: The TASS telegram published in the Moscow Pravda on April 7 summarizing the US military aid to China is completely fabricated. The content of the article is too far from the truth, so I think it is only necessary to point out a few major errors, and the rest are not worth arguing. The article stated that after the Japanese surrender, the United States trained and equipped forty divisions of the "Kuomintang Army", which is twice the number of Chinese troops trained and equipped by the United States during the Sino-Japanese War. It also trained and equipped 50,000 "Kuomintang police". The US military advisory group established 27 military schools, and the US separated Qingdao Port from China. Powerful US air force bases were built near major cities. It goes without saying that there is no such thing as a "Kuomintang Army" or "Kuomintang police" in China. The only Chinese political party with a private army is the Chinese Communist Party. During the Anti-Japanese War, the United States assisted China in training 36 divisions, totaling less than 400,000 people, of which 6 divisions were trained in India and fully equipped by the United States, and the remaining 30 divisions were trained in China, partially equipped by the United States, but most of the weapons were made by China itself. The formation of these troops was for the purpose of counterattacking Japan. Some divisions participated in battles in Myanmar and other places. US military equipment was delivered before the Japanese surrender. As a result of the military reorganization, the actual number of these troops is now less than 36 divisions. After the Japanese surrender, no new troops were trained by the United States, no new military academies were established, and no Chinese police were trained by the United States. In Qingdao, the work of Chinese government officials has never been interfered with by foreign countries. There are no US air force bases in China. During the Anti-Japanese War, some airfields were jointly used by China and the United States to fight against Japan. After the Japanese surrender, the United States quickly withdrew from various battlefields, starting with the airfields in the west. A small number of airfields continued to be used by US aircraft to assist China in the repatriation and reception of prisoners. During the Marshall mediation period and after the mediation work stopped, many Communist personnel also benefited from the convenience of US aircraft transport. During the Anti-Japanese War, all measures taken by the United States in China were based on the strategy of the United Nations. At that time and afterward, the actions of the United States did not infringe on China's sovereignty. The report in Pravda completely distorts the facts known to the world.

### Draft Banking Law Initially Reviewed Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The draft Banking Law was initially reviewed by the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 9th, chaired by Zhang Zhaoyuan. Dai Mingli, Director of the Department of Finance, Deng Hanliang, Director of the Department of Economy, and Shanghai silver and money industry representatives Shen Rixin, Zhu Xuchang, Zou Rangqing, and Lu Shuliang attended. Shen Rixin and others explained the hopes of the silver and money industry for the law, hoping that the freedom of operation could be increased, government control could be reduced, and put forward other opinions. According to Zhang Zhaoyuan, the drafter, the preliminary review work can be completed on the 10th, and the Finance and Economics Committees will hold a joint meeting on the 12th. The case can be submitted to the next meeting of the Legislative Yuan.

### The US Will Not Take Diplomatic Steps Regarding the Tanggu Incident

[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] Acting US Secretary of State Acheson spoke at a press conference today about the attack on US Marines stationed in China. He said that the United States does not intend to take any diplomatic steps regarding this case. Acheson said: It cannot be expected that the Chinese government will be responsible for this attack, so the Marines will take appropriate steps on the spot.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 9th] The five US Marines who died in the Communist attack in Xinhe last Saturday are scheduled to be buried at the Tanggu Catholic Church at 6 PM today, with the ceremony presided over by military chaplain Martin. At the same time, the Marine Corps authorities plan to invite reporters to interview the injured American soldiers being treated at the Tianjin hospital soon to report on the incident.

US Commander in China General Gillen passed through this station by special train yesterday afternoon. Those who went to welcome him included Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi, US Marine Corps Commander Howard, etc. It is said that when the US military police were maintaining order, they pushed Mayor Du, and Marine Corps Major Di Ming immediately apologized to Mayor Du verbally. However, some Chinese still expressed their anger. It is reported that trenches will also be dug around the Dongbing Factory, where the Marine Corps is stationed outside Tianjin, and a security line will be set up. Similar security measures have also been decided to be taken near the Xinhe arsenal.

### US Soldier Insults Reporter in Tianjin; Howard Sends Letter of Apology

And Expresses Punishment for the Offending Military Police

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 9th] When General Gillen passed through Tianjin at noon on the 8th, more than a dozen Tianjin reporters welcomed him at the station. While they were conducting interviews, they were driven away by two US military police. At that time, the US military police not only pushed the reporters with barbaric attitudes but also made insulting remarks. The reporters were insulted for no reason and immediately asked the Foreign Reporters Association to convene an emergency meeting. It was resolved to submit a protest to the US military authorities through the city government. General Howard, the commander of the US military in Tianjin, expressed his apologies for this unfortunate incident. He has sent a letter to the Tianjin municipal government on the 9th to express his apologies to the reporters and stated that the offending military police will be punished to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

### Communist Forces in the Outskirts of Jinan and the Central Section of Jiaoji Have Been Greatly Reduced; Large-Scale Suppression in the Mountain Areas Is Underway

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] The strength of the Communist forces in the outskirts of Jinan has been greatly reduced. Currently, only the 7th and 11th Divisions of Jie are entrenched near Guodian in the east of the city, and the 6th Brigade of the police near Yucheng in the north of the city are regular troops. The rest are all militia, so people's hearts are stable and the market is gradually becoming prosperous. Especially after the recovery of Tai'an and the opening of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway front, a large amount of food from Southwestern Shandong is pouring in, and food prices are falling. The price of second-class flour on the 9th has fallen from the past 100,000 to 75,000 per bag. The prices of department stores are also weakening. In addition to being excited, the various circles of the provincial capital have organized a慰勞團 (comfort delegation) to go south to Tai'an to comfort the troops on the 12th.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 9th] The main force of the Communist forces in Shandong Province is now concentrated in the following two areas: (1) Mount Tai north of Tai'an and Mount Tulai in the southeast and the Lai, Xin, and Meng area, (2) the Yishui and Juxian area. It seems that they are trying to take the opportunity to attack the flanks of the Nationalist forces advancing east and north. In addition to proceeding step by step, Nationalist forces are closely monitoring the Communist forces. The strength of the Communist forces in the central section of Jiaoji has been greatly reduced.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Nationalist forces have been conducting large-scale suppressions of the five divisions and one independent brigade, totaling 50,000 troops, of the Communist forces, including the New First, New Seventh, New Eighth, Jie Seventh, and Jie Eighth, active in the mountain areas northwest and southwest of Liangqiu and to the north for days. After the Nationalist forces recovered Dashi, Dahuashantou, and Qingshigang, 18 kilometers southwest of Liangqiu, on the 8th, they continued to sweep the areas of Shihuangyu, Sancha River, Hongshanwan, and Qili River.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] Li Wang, the chairman of the Communist Party in Shandong, and Zhang Guangzhong, commander of the Communist Party in Lunan Military Region, held a military meeting at Hongling, 20 kilometers northwest of Liangqiu, on the evening of the 7th, preparing to flee back to the northeastern mountainous area of Feixian County.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] More than 10,000 Communist troops in the mountains of Southern Shandong harassed the Sihuhu and Hanzhuang area in the northern border of Pixian County on the night of the 8th.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] The Nationalist forces in Linyi recovered the ancient city, 15 kilometers north of Linyi, at 8 AM on the 8th.

### Remembering the Battle of Yan'an

— Zhang Zhou

Advancing two to three hundred kilometers in six days, recapturing several major cities, crossing three or four strong defense lines, gaining a foothold in the core of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, which the Communist army had occupied for thirteen years, and continuing to advance—no matter how you look at it, the military achievement is undeniable. The Communist army's military district division in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia consists of four areas: (1) the Yanshu District (i.e., the area surrounding Yan'an), (2) the Anbian District (the area around Jingbian and Yanchi), (3) the Longdong District (belonging to Qingyang, Ningxian, and Heshui), and (4) the Guanzhong District (near Malan). In February of this year, when the peace negotiations were becoming increasingly bleak, the Communist army launched offensives in the Guanzhong and Longdong Districts, disturbing the National army. After the National army was stationed in Heshui, Qingyang, and other places, the Longdong offensive was shattered. After the recapture of Malan, the Guanzhong Military District also completely collapsed. Although the National army suffered losses in these two battles, the Communist army also suffered heavy casualties. In addition to the militia, the 1st Security Brigade, the 1st Training Brigade, and the 2nd Brigade also lost their main forces. Even the Communist army's veteran cadres (units that participated in the Long March), known as the Flying Horse Brigade, the New 4th Brigade, were defeated by the National army. These two battles were the prelude to the Battle of Yan'an. When the CCP "defended Yan'an," these numbered units, due to the loss of their main forces, had reduced combat effectiveness and collapsed within six days, which was one of the reasons.

Among the four military districts of the "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Region," only the Yanshu Military District had the most solid defensive fortifications. For more than ten years, the Communist army had never slackened in its defense projects in Yan'an. The reporter had visited the positions near Chafang in the county and the fortifications in Laushan and Qingliangshan, and they were indeed very solid. The defense equipment against the air force and the army was all available. In particular, the tops of the large and small Laushan mountains mostly had very long tunnels and underground facilities. It is said that when Zhang Xueliang's troops advanced to suppress Yan'an in 1935, two divisions were completely annihilated in the Laushan valley. Now, after more than ten years, it is a fact that it is more resilient and complete than in the past.

The National army began a full-scale attack at dawn on the 14th, advancing in five routes between Luochuan and Yichuan. At that time, the Communist army's plan was not only to stop the National army, but also to eliminate the National army completely outside Yan'an (according to Chen Guodong, deputy commander of the 1st Security Brigade of the Communist army, who was captured by the National army). The Communist army made a big mistake in its strategic assessment of the National army. They thought that the National army would advance steadily from the front, so they had strong equipment on the front. For example, south of Yan'an, they not only buried landmines, but also prepared to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, wanting to trap the National army to death. At the same time, they also felt very strong in the combat effectiveness of the Communist army.

On the morning of March 14, the National army on the left recaptured Jiaodao. After a day of fierce fighting on the 15th, they took Chafang and stopped advancing, only deploying troops on the front. The National army advancing from Yichuan then lightly advanced and attacked Laushan from the side, and detoured towards Yan'an. In this way, the Communist army's plan completely failed. At dawn on the 19th, the First Division, 167th Brigade, under General Li Kungang, captured two hilltops east of Yan'an. At that time, the Communist army held firm on the western hilltops. After the National army's artillery bombardment for four hours, the Communist army could not hold on and retreated. Yan'an, which attracted the world's attention, was lightly recaptured by the National army. Amid the rumbling of artillery fire, the citizens of Yan'an were mobilized by the Communist army to evacuate to the surrounding mountain valleys. Only forty or fifty old, young, disabled people remained in the city.

Ganquan, Yanchang, and Anse were also occupied by the National army in the shortest time. The citizens of Yan'an slowly returned a week later. Street vendors gradually resumed business, and the slogans of the Communist army in the past were brushed over, and new ones were replaced. The "special zone" of the past is normal again today.

In the strategic aspect of the Battle of Yan'an, the Communist army's miscalculation was very great. It still regarded today's National army strategy as the "stupid method" of ten years ago. In the calculation of the Communist army's combat effectiveness, it also almost completely failed. In the documents left by the Communist army in Chafang, they hoped that the defending troops there could resist until March 29 at the shortest. In fact, they only resisted for one day. Similarly, the Communist army had been preparing for many years for the Jinpenwan position on the right wing, and the defending troops were a special service regiment. According to their ideals, this could be defended for at least three or four days, but in fact, they only fought for four or five hours, took seven or eight shells, and ran away.

Most of the people dared to be angry but dared not speak out against the Communist army. The middle and lower-level cadres of the Communist army were also afraid of the National army's excellent weapons. According to a friend, in the Battle of Jinpenwan, after the National army bombarded them with artillery, the Communist army soldiers ignored the orders of their "officers" and collapsed. This episode shows their morale. In Yan'an, I interviewed more than a dozen militiamen who had been captured by the National army. Most of them surrendered with their weapons. They were all sallow, thin, and covered in dust. After eight years of hard struggle against Japan, the general public really had a headache for war. I asked them why they had to fight. Most of them said solemnly: "Who wants to? There's no way." The Battle of Yan'an was not a large-scale main battle, but a success of senior command, saving many lives. Although this is not the death knell of the Communist army, it has its due achievements in the people's faith and the morale of the National army. On the Chafang position, an officer said to me: "The Communist army has no energy and can't take a beating. I feel like they are not as fierce as they were in Jiangxi." (April 5)

### Syngman Rhee Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Says He Will Organize the Government After Returning to Korea Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Tonight to Meet with the Chairman

[Our Newspaper News] Dr. Syngman Rhee, the Korean revolutionary leader, accompanied by his secretary Zhang Jiyong, arrived in China from the United States on a giant Northwest Airlines plane. He arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 8th and continued west that night, arriving in Shanghai at 4:20 pm yesterday (the 9th). Korean residents and people from all walks of life in the city went to Jiangwan Airport to greet him. Among them were General Lee Qing-cheon, Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Restoration Army, Zai Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the National Diplomacy Association, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, Zhang Bide, Chief of the Protocol Section of the Municipal Government, Gao Lingbai, Official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Jiazhen and Li Luoxia of the Municipal Women's Association, and representatives from about 200 people from 20 organizations including the Sino-Korean Cultural Association, the Korean Overseas Residents Association, the Korean Academy of Classics, the Korean Overseas Patriotic Women's Association, and the Korean Inseong School. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

Mr. Rhee is 72 years old, but he is still in good spirits. After getting off the plane, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers. After the Kong Yunqing sisters of the Women's Association presented flowers, Mr. Rhee immediately addressed all the overseas residents, saying: "I am deeply grateful to the overseas compatriots for coming here to welcome me. I have discussed the organization of the government with the US government in the United States, and we have reached an agreement. I will prepare to organize the government when I return home. I am very sympathetic to the hardships of the overseas residents living abroad." Then, after giving instructions to the primary school students of Inseong School, he went straight to Room 401 of the Capital Hotel to rest.

Mr. Rhee's Remarks

Mr. Rhee met with reporters at the Capital Hotel and made remarks stating: Regarding the organization of the government, he has reached a result with the US government authorities in the United States and has obtained the consent of General Hodge. On the way through Tokyo, he had a long talk with General MacArthur for two hours. MacArthur fully agreed to the two major principles of establishing a Korean provisional government and Koreans governing Korea. After returning to Korea this time, he intends to start organizing the government. As soon as the Korean legislative body passes the election law, universal suffrage will be implemented to establish a democratically elected central government, which should not be too far away. However, the government currently planned to be organized is limited to southern Korea, because the north is currently under the control of the Soviet army. The government we originally hoped to organize included the entire north and south, but General Hodge's intention is to temporarily shelve the north in order to avoid misunderstandings with the Soviet Union. We hope that after the government is established in the south, we can directly negotiate with the Soviet Union to withdraw the Soviet troops and complete the unified government of the north and south.

Mr. Rhee also said: When he was in the United States, he obtained the consent of President Truman to lend 600 million US dollars to the Korean government after the Korean government was established to provide post-disaster and economic assistance. This case will be submitted after the US loans to Greece and Turkey are passed in Congress.

Mission to China

When reporters asked about Mr. Rhee's mission to China, he said: This time there is no secret mission. He only intends to visit Chairman Chiang to enable the two countries to gain a deeper understanding and enhance diplomatic relations. The Korean people are very grateful to Chairman Chiang, especially for Chairman Chiang's assistance to the Korean provisional government, and express their sincere gratitude. The cooperation between China and Korea is of great help to peace in the Far East. I am very sympathetic to Chairman Chiang in dealing with the Communist Party issue, because the current situation in Korea is actually the same as in China.

Mr. Rhee also stated: The national policies currently planned to be implemented after the organization of the government, the first is to obtain cooperation and understanding with the Soviet Union. In addition, it is necessary to open Korean currency exchange and establish diplomatic and economic status.

As for his relationship with Kim Gu, Mr. Rhee said that he and Kim Gu have always maintained a very close relationship in the spirit of cooperation. The Korean people all hope that he and Kim Gu can jointly serve as leaders of Korea.

Going to Nanjing Tonight

Mr. Rhee is scheduled to take the night train to Nanjing tonight to meet with Chairman Chiang and will return to Korea on the 13th of this month. At 7:30 pm yesterday, 21 organizations including the Shanghai Municipal Government Council held a reception for Mr. Rhee on the 18th floor of the International Hotel, attended by more than 30 people including Mayor Wu. At noon today, the Sino-Korean Cultural Association and the National Diplomacy Association jointly held a banquet for Mr. Rhee at the Ze Lou Restaurant. At 4:00 pm, 21 Sino-Korean organizations still hosted a cocktail party at the 14th floor of the International Hotel.

### Receiving Lushun and Dalian Is a Key Issue The Key Lies in Resolving the Illegal Military Forces Whether the Soviet Side Is Sincere Can Be Judged by This

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 9th] Regarding the key issue of receiving Lushun and Dalian, it is known that the issue is still the dissolution of the Communist army and the puppet regime within the Soviet military cordon. According to relevant agencies: this illegal armed force and puppet regime should be disarmed or dismissed by the Soviet army, otherwise the National army must destroy it itself before talking about receiving administrative issues. Because our side, in view of the past reception of Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar, has no guarantee of life and freedom of action, such as the brutal killing of Zhang Xinfu and the forced withdrawal of Songbei reception personnel from the Soviet territory to Shanghai, there is no need to repeat the same mistakes. Whether the Soviet side can handle it according to our wishes can measure whether the Soviet side is sincere in returning Lushun and Dalian.

[Another Telegram] The Autonomy Cadre Training Class, which was established to improve the reception of Lushun and Dalian, is actively training after starting classes on the 7th and will graduate on the 20th. The 160 cadres being trained are all district and Bao chiefs who work locally. In addition, the Lushun and Dalian Reception Personnel Training Class run by the Xingyuan will start on the 14th and will be completed on the 20th. Most of the participants in the training class are senior reception personnel.

### Overseas Chinese Going to Japan for Repatriation The Time Is Not Yet Ripe Japan's Economy Is in Trouble and It Is Not Easy to Do Business

[This City News] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission said: Overseas Chinese in Japan have repeatedly requested repatriation. Now, we have received definite information from the delegation stationed in Japan that Japan has not yet restored foreign trade, and its domestic economy is in trouble, and it is not easy to do business. Currently, more than 20,000 overseas Chinese in Japan feel it is difficult to make a living. Those who have no job and wander around will be rescued and sent back to China. Therefore, overseas Chinese in both countries should postpone going to Japan for the time being. Moreover, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan stipulates that, except for personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and personnel related to the occupying forces, ordinary foreign people are not allowed to enter the country. Judging from this, the time for overseas Chinese returning to China to go to Japan for repatriation still needs to wait a while.

In addition, regarding the regulations for Chinese people going to the United States according to the US immigration law: (1) Those who go to the United States with a tourist visa from the US consulate with an ordinary passport can only stay for one year and are not allowed to be employed in any job; (2) Those who go to the United States with a student visa are also not allowed to be employed. It is hoped that Chinese people going to the United States will pay attention to these regulations.

### Guangdong Ship Explosion Case on Guangzhou-Hong Kong Line Cracked Four Bandits Caught in One Net

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 9th] The explosion case of the British-owned Guangdong ship on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong line has been cracked by the police station here. The bandit leader Ye Chou and four bandits have been caught in one net. They confessed that they had used the name of Tongyu Group to extort 10,000 Hong Kong dollars from the Guangdong ship and used a self-made magnetic timed mine to explode the ship on March 22. The "TNT" and Japanese yellow explosives used were left over from his time as the captain of an enemy-killing team in a certain army during the war.

[Another Telegram] The Wu Xue ship on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou line has also received a threatening letter demanding 150,000 Hong Kong dollars. Otherwise, the ship will be exploded when it leaves Hong Kong on the 8th. The Hong Kong authorities informed the Guangzhou police station of this telegram, but the police here had already captured the previous batch of bandits on the evening of the 7th, so the ship did not have an accident.

### Chen Zhiping Invited to Fly to Baguio Sino-Philippine Negotiations to Resume The Philippine Congress Again Proposes Opposition to Our Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Manila, 9th] Negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship and General Relations will be formally reopened by Chen Zhiping, our minister to the Philippines, and Quirino, the Philippine vice president and foreign minister, in Baguio. Minister Chen has already taken a special plane to Baguio this morning. The reopening of the negotiations was requested by the Philippine side. Quirino called our embassy yesterday from Baguio, inviting Minister Chen and Sun Biqi, the first secretary, to this summer capital, with the intention of reopening the long-stalled negotiations. Accompanying Mr. Quirino were Foreign Secretary Africa and Assistant Legal Advisor Madaba, who both held important positions in the previous negotiations. Minister Chen will stay there for two days as a guest of Mr. Quirino. Well-informed sources told reporters today that our negotiating representatives will oppose changing the already agreed terms. The reopening of this negotiation may mean that the Philippine Foreign Ministry will withdraw the actions of finally canceling several articles of the draft in February, which caused the negotiations to stall. Also, it is learned that the negotiations on the British-Philippine Commercial Treaty have also encountered difficulties. The Philippines is likely not a good market for British goods.

[Central News Agency, Manila, 9th] Just as the negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship are reopening, another bill opposing our overseas Chinese has been proposed in the Philippine Congress. Sha Tu, chairman of the Philippine Anti-Chinese Alliance, proposed yesterday in the Philippine Senate the Filipinization of the timber business and retail trade, that is, this transaction should be limited to Philippine citizens or companies whose capital is entirely owned by Filipinos. Mr. Sha claimed that the timber industry should be limited to Philippine citizens or companies whose capital is 60% owned by Filipinos in accordance with the Philippine Constitution, but although the Constitution has this provision, the timber retail industry is still controlled by foreigners.

On the same day, they went down to Qijiazi (20 kilometers northwest of Qian Gorlos Mongol Autonomous County) and were rejected by the Communist army on the grounds that they "had not received orders from the Harbin Command." As a result, the entire transport team turned to Dehui, intending to cross the river from Dehui and contact the Communist side again. All the relief supplies were unloaded and stored in Dehui, and after the negotiations were settled, they were reloaded onto trains and transported to Harbin. Currently, eleven empty trucks returned to Changchun from Dehui on the evening of the 8th.

### Korea Must Obtain Independence - Welcome Dr. Syngman Rhee to China

Korean revolutionary leader Dr. Syngman Rhee arrived in Shanghai yesterday by plane from the United States. The Sino-Korean Cultural Association and the National Diplomacy Association here, as well as various party, government, educational, and other organizations, have prepared a grand welcome to comfort Dr. Rhee from the fatigue of his journey and to strengthen the ties between China and Korea. China and Korea are as close as brothers, and we sincerely welcome Dr. Rhee's long journey, and we wish the doctor good health during his stay in China!

Korea, also known as Joseon, is a large peninsula protruding southeast of the Asian continent, long from north to south, and located between China, the Soviet Union, and Japan. It is bordered by the Sea of Japan to the east, the Yellow Sea to the west, the Korea Strait to the south facing Kyushu, Japan, and parts of China, and the Yalu and Tumen Rivers to the north bordering northeastern China and the Soviet Maritime Territory. In terms of national power, it serves as a "land bridge" between the Asian continent and the Japanese archipelago, and in terms of politics, economy, and culture, it has the closest relationship with China. Since its founding, the Korean people have suffered from encirclement and trampling by the Mongols, Manchus, and Japanese, but the Korean people have continued to struggle for independence and freedom. The First Sino-Japanese War from 1894 to 1895 and the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905, although granting independence to the peninsula, gradually increased Japanese influence from then on. For a short period, it was a Japanese protectorate, and in 1910, it was formally incorporated into the Japanese territory. The Korean people, unwilling to be ruled by Japan, launched many uprisings, the most famous of which was the "March 1st Independence Movement" in 1919, also known as the "March 1st Revolution," one of the most heroic revolutionary movements of small and weak nations in Asia. In this movement, Dr. Syngman Rhee provided steadfast leadership. As the revolutionary movement unfolded, Dr. Rhee was supported by the entire Korean people and honorably served as the first president of the Korean Provisional Government, making outstanding contributions. After the failure of the "March 1st Revolution," Dr. Rhee went into exile overseas and continued to lead the independence movement for more than twenty years. His spirit is truly admirable! His ambition is also admirable! This visit by Dr. Rhee to China will not only enhance Sino-Korean relations and the Chinese people's understanding of Korea but will also surely benefit the current changes in the Korean environment, striving for the status that Korea deserves for its freedom and independence.

Korea must be independent, and the Korean people must be free. This is the cry of the Korean people, the cry of the Chinese people, and the cry of the nations participating in the Pan-Asian Conference. The Korean people are a distinct ethnic group in terms of race, and their national life and geography cannot be separated. Their national spirit is firm and unyielding, making them one of the most promising and promising nations for the present and future Asian century. But Korea must be independent and must be free. When the leaders of China, Britain, and the United States met in Cairo in 1943, they clearly declared that they would jointly oppress Japan and demand unconditional surrender, and provide as much assistance as possible to Korea to achieve independence and freedom. This declaration had a tremendous stimulating effect on the revolutionary leaders of Korea in exile overseas, especially the Korean Provisional Government in Chongqing and the Korean expatriates in Britain and the United States. They were excited by the bright future of the revolution and thus worked even harder to assist in the cause of resisting Japanese aggression, in return for the lofty friendship of the United Nations towards them. Unfortunately, when Japan surrendered in 1945 and the United Nations achieved victory, Korean independence was still within sight but out of reach. The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union was intertwined in the Korean issue, and the sorrow of the Korean people's environment is truly sympathetic! Therefore, the cry for Korean independence and freedom is echoing in every corner of Asia.

Today's Korean environment is like this: on the eve of Japan's declaration of unconditional surrender, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, and the Red Army quickly moved towards northeastern China and northern Korea; then Japan surrendered, and the US military occupied Seoul, Korea. On September 10 of that year, the US occupying forces established a military government in Seoul. From then on, Korea was invisibly divided into two parts, with the US and Soviet forces occupying the north and south of the peninsula, separated by the 38th parallel. The area occupied by the Soviet army included North Hamgyong Province, South Hamgyong Province, North Pyongan Province, South Pyongan Province, Hwanghae Province (except for a very small southern part), and the northern half of Gangwon Province, totaling 48,487 square miles, accounting for 56.9% of the total area of Korea, with a population of 8,314,000, accounting for 36.5% of the total population of Korea; the area occupied by the US military included South Jeolla Province, North Jeolla Province, South Gyeongsang Province, North Gyeongsang Province, South Chungcheong Province, North Chungcheong Province, Gyeonggi Province, the southern half of Gangwon Province, and a very small southern part of Hwanghae Province, totaling approximately 36,761 square miles, accounting for 43.1% of the total area of Korea, with a population of 14,485,000, accounting for 63.5% of the total population of Korea. In terms of economic value, the US military's occupation area is more significant; in terms of strategic value, the Soviet military's occupation area is more important. The complex contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Korean issue are the misfortune of Korea and the misfortune of the future of peace in the Far East, but the unfortunate development of events was legalized at the Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in December of that year. The three countries announced an agreement on the Korean issue, stipulating that the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union would jointly administer Korea for five years. During this period of trusteeship, Korea would be divided into two administrative districts under the US and Soviet Union. Obviously, the conclusion of the agreement seems to be contrary to the spirit of national autonomy, splitting the unity of Korea, delaying the independence of Korea, deepening the contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union, and posing a significant threat to northeastern China. Whether in terms of the spirit of the Cairo Declaration, the spirit of the United Nations Charter, or even the future of peace in the Far East, the independence of Korea is inevitable, and the freedom of the Korean people is inevitable. The so-called joint administration and joint trusteeship cannot bring stability and peace to Korea and the Far East; it can only increase the turmoil and crisis in Korea and the Far East. Kim Gu, Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government, declared when he left Chongqing to return to Korea: "Korea must not be divided into two. I firmly believe that after the United Nations completes its mission, it will return this political power to the free Koreans. The people of the North and South must unite to make the motherland strong and prosperous again." How meaningful this is.

We, China, are committed to assisting the independence and freedom of small and weak nations. We sympathize with Korea's current situation, oppose the trusteeship of Korea, and consistently place great hope in the unity of the Korean people in the North and South and Korea's early achievement of independence and freedom. At the Pan-Asian Conference, we saw the Korean representative Bae Ke calling on the Allied countries to fulfill their promises and realize Korea's independence as soon as possible. Now, the Korean revolutionary leader Dr. Syngman Rhee, who is in opposition, has come to visit China. In addition to warmly welcoming Dr. Rhee, we also hope that the Korean people will unite and work hard, under the leadership of Dr. Syngman Rhee and other revolutionary leaders, to strive together so that a unified government that truly represents the will of the Korean people can be established as soon as possible and restore strength and prosperity.

[Dispatch from Wuxi, This Newspaper, 9th] Today, the Wuxi People's Newspaper published a news story about a dispute between teachers and students of a border school and railway police over ticket supplements at the station.

### Local Communications

Zhenjiang

The temporary consultative assemblies of Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Baoying, Suqian, Huaiyin, and other counties in northern Jiangsu have successively requested a postponement of conscription to allow the people to rest. According to reliable information from the Northern Jiangsu Garrison Command, northern Jiangsu will focus on organizing Baojia and counting the number of able-bodied men in the first half of this year, and will not conscript soldiers. The conscription period for national standing soldiers will begin in the second half of the year.

Suzhou

The Wudi District Court ruled that the case of the seventeen grain stores, including Mu Du Yan, was insufficient and did not prosecute. The Suzhou County Government considered that the amount of hoarded grain in the case was considerable and that the rice price was tending to rise again. It specially telegraphed to the Wuxi District Office to supervise the grain stores together with the Chamber of Commerce to sell all the hoarded grain at the limited price.

Songjiang

The rice price in this county is rising daily. The reason is that merchants from other places are buying in bulk at high prices and transporting it by train to Zhenjiang for transshipment. Therefore, the price is inevitably higher than the average price. Magistrate Xu, in order to suppress the price in accordance with the provincial order, specially convened an emergency meeting of relevant agencies and organizations yesterday and decided to strictly enforce the regulations.

Kunshan

The Criminal Police Team of this county arrested two bandits, Yan Lianzi and Zhang Si, who committed a major robbery in Xinzhen, at the railway station on the 6th, and seized a considerable amount of stolen goods, which were all sent to the court for handling.

Haining

The county bank of this county is scheduled to establish its location in Xiaoshi on the 10th. It is decided to set up the Qianhe Street in Xiaoshi Town, and the share capital has been fully collected.

Jinhua

All sectors of this county decided to form the Jinhua Public Utility Cooperative with Limited Liability to take over the operation of the Quanhua Branch of the Eastern Zhejiang Power Plant, which is about to be shut down. It is planned to first raise a capital of 130 million yuan, with 50,000 yuan per share.

Qingpu

Sheshan Mountain in this county is a Catholic holy place with beautiful scenery, attracting many Chinese and foreign tourists. During the Feast of the Assumption next month, Catholics from all over will climb the mountain to pay homage. At that time, there will inevitably be crowded vehicles and horses. The county government has specially submitted a request to the province for materials to carry out large-scale repairs because the bridges and roads of the Songqing Highway Qingshe section, which must be passed to climb the mountain, have been in disrepair for many years.

Changshu

Quan Yangqing, the district chief of Dongtang District, suddenly committed suicide on the morning of the 7th due to family reasons, stabbing himself twice in the chest. He was seriously injured and was taken to a public hospital for treatment. However, he lost too much blood and has not yet escaped danger.

Hefei

The central government purchased 1.2 million shi of provincial and county-level public grain in Anhui. The provincial consultative assembly sent representatives to Beijing to appeal to the central government and obtained three measures: (1) reduce the purchase of county-level grain by 10,000 shi, (2) each county will deliver grain locally according to the market scale, and (3) the transportation cost will be borne by the central government.

Jiang Heming, a villager of Zhongjie Village (20 li from the city), Changshou, served as the captain of the second squadron of the second battalion of the Zhongjiu Army during the Anti-Japanese War. After retiring, he engaged in business. At the end of last month, five bandits broke into his house, tied Jiang up, and demanded a ransom of 20 million yuan. After eight days, because his wife could not raise the money, he was torn up. His body was found in the Dangjiaqiao River on the 4th. The death was very tragic.

### Molotov Suddenly Agrees to Discuss the Future Boundaries of Germany; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Seems to Have Slightly Improved; Many Believe This Is the Result of Successive Warnings from Britain and the United States

[Report from This Newspaper] Moscow Radio, 9th: The Four Foreign Ministers will hold a meeting today to discuss two major issues: (1) part of the German-Polish border, and (2) the handling of the Ruhr and Rhineland. Regarding the first issue, Marshall will propose the establishment of a special committee to study the entire German-Polish border issue on the spot. As for the second issue, Marshall will propose that it be handled by the United Nations.

[United Press, Moscow, 9th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will debate the future borders of defeated Germany today. It is expected that the United States will demand the revision of the western border of Poland, with part of the land returned to Germany. It is reported that the United States has drafted a German-State border plan, which will allow Germany to retain the Ruhr area, assign Upper Silesia to Poland, and allow other European countries to participate in the management of the extremely important economic resources of the two regions. The Soviet Union will oppose this. In addition, the Four Foreign Ministers will also have disputes over France's request for the Ruhr and Rhineland industrial areas. Western diplomats said that today's meeting should clearly show whether Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov is willing to work together with US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin to speed up the work of the conference.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 8th] The Soviet Union's insistence on opposing the discussion of the basic issues of the German Peace Treaty has now improved after US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin successively warned Molotov that it would harm the progress of the conference. Marshall requested at today's Four-Power Conference to begin suggestive work and stop arguing with each other, saying: "If we continue to argue and cannot reach an agreement, this conference may not achieve anything." Bevin condemned Molotov's refusal to discuss basic issues, deliberately hindering the progress of the conference. At this point, Molotov suddenly expressed his concession, and the four powers agreed to discuss the future borders of Germany, the Ruhr and Rhineland areas, etc., tomorrow, and scheduled to discuss the procedure for drafting the Peace Treaty on the 10th, and listen to the report of the Adjustment Committee on various disputes on the 11th. Molotov also agreed to send a new representative to participate in the Adjustment Committee or the Foreign Undersecretaries' Conference to carry out the work of the German Peace Treaty. The Soviet Union currently has only one representative, Foreign Undersecretary Vyshinsky, attending the Adjustment Committee and the Foreign Undersecretaries' Conference, so that the two conferences cannot proceed simultaneously, affecting the progress of the work. Molotov first angrily rebuked Britain and the United States at the conference today for refusing to fulfill the Potsdam Agreement on compensation issues and expressed dissatisfaction with the delaying work of the Allied Reparations Committee. Bevin immediately replied that this was due to the failure to obtain information from the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union had not fulfilled its obligations to Western countries in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Today's meeting did not end until Molotov, after being warned by Bevin and Marshall, agreed to schedule a hearing of the Adjustment Committee's report and discuss various basic issues of the German Peace Treaty.

The Conference May Be Extended by Ten Days

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] At the end of today's meeting, when discussing the next agenda, Molotov suggested meeting at 5 or 6 PM on the afternoon of the 9th so that the Adjustment Committee would have time to prepare its report. Bevin protested why the third point on the agenda was not discussed, saying, "This way is really unfair to us." Marshall also insisted on proceeding according to the agenda, saying, "We should not continue to "internally discuss differences." We should clarify the overall situation so as to prepare a better foundation for the next Foreign Ministers' Conference. Marshall's mention of the next Foreign Ministers' Conference indicates that British and American personnel are dissatisfied with this Foreign Ministers' Conference. British and American personnel are very skeptical about whether this conference can reach some agreements, and they even doubt whether a Peace Treaty with Austria can be drafted in the Soviet capital. It is reported that the present conference may be extended for some time. British and American representatives separately purchased return plane tickets for the 13th and 15th several days ago, but now it seems that the conference will be extended by ten days.

### Foreign Ministers' Representatives Complete Draft of Austrian Peace Treaty

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th, United Press] Although the four Foreign Ministers' representatives have now completed the work on the Austrian Peace Treaty, US representative Clark said that the prospect of reaching a final agreement is "not very bright." The Soviet Union has made no concessions on the Austrian issue, and the draft Austrian Peace Treaty has been submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] The four Foreign Ministers' representatives have completed the review of the text of the Austrian Peace Treaty today, but have not been able to add the agreed-upon clauses to their report. The report, which was submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 29, shows that of the total of 55 articles in the Austrian Peace Treaty, only 24 have been agreed upon by the four countries.

### British-Soviet Treaty Revision Negotiations Progressing Smoothly

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th] Regarding the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union to revise the alliance treaty, according to British personnel here, although they had to be temporarily suspended due to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, they have actually made good progress. British and Soviet parties exchanged their drafts a few days ago, and today British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Peterson and Harver will meet with Soviet Foreign Undersecretary Vyshinsky again. Since the opening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, this is the third meeting between British and Soviet representatives. Once the two sides exchange views on the drafts, it is hoped that all issues related to the alliance treaty can be discussed.

### British Foreign Secretary Fetes US, Soviet, and French Foreign Ministers

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin hosted a banquet at the British Embassy today to entertain the foreign ministers of the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, US Secretary of State General Marshall, French Foreign Minister and Mrs. Bidault, and Soviet Foreign Undersecretary Vyshinsky all attended.

### Bevin's Foreign Policy May Receive Support from the Labour Party

Rumours of a Cabinet Reshuffle in Britain

[Reuters, London, 8th] Authoritative sources here expect the Labour Party to approve Foreign Secretary Bevin's foreign policy at the National Conference to be held on the fortieth day after Easter. Cabinet ministers have recently held frequent debates on foreign policy, and the situation at the meeting shows that most Labour leaders also support it, and 75% of the 300 Labour MPs in the House of Commons also support Bevin and the Cabinet. Related parties believe that the two most noteworthy issues at the Labour Party National Conference will be the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the manpower required for Britain's overseas troops and national defense.

[Associated Press, London, 8th] Rumors are circulating here today that the British Cabinet is about to be reorganized, saying that British Prime Minister Attlee is considering having Foreign Secretary Bevin take charge of the government's planning work to conquer the economic crisis. According to the "Star," which has always expressed goodwill towards the Labour government, Prime Minister Attlee is considering reorganizing the cabinet during his Easter vacation, but the scope of the adjustment will depend on Morrison's health. Morrison is not only the leader of the Labour Party, but also the leader of the government faction in the House of Commons and the Minister of Economic Planning, but is now in France for medical treatment due to illness.

### Vandenberg Urges Senate to Pass Aid to Greece and Turkey Act; Indirectly Refutes Soviet Accusations in Speech

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] Republican Senator Vandenberg addressed the Senate as it began debating Truman's Aid to Greece and Turkey Act, calling on the Soviet Union to agree to the principle of "survival and co-existence" to resolve problems in US-Soviet relations. Vandenberg denied that the proposed aid was a new doctrine comparable to the Monroe Doctrine. He also urged the passage of Truman's plan as a precaution to prevent problems before they arise.

He said: "The issue involved in this case is similar to the problems in our country's peace process and the constant friction between Eastern communism and Western democracy. From this issue, various difficulties between the Soviet Union and its vassal states and the United States and other non-communist countries continue to arise. In addition, the phenomenon of hostility towards communist expansion and infiltration is more obvious. At the same time, we often hear the Soviet Union's fear that its neighbors will re-invade. If Moscow really has such fears, it should eliminate them.

All Countries Should Have the Right to Autonomy

We strongly advocate that the United States and other countries should have the right to autonomy, and we also believe that the Soviet Union should have the right to autonomy. If we can respect each other, this kind of fear can be reduced. Vandenberg continued: "We have the right to demand that the Soviet Union prove that it has no intention of surrounding us with the communist world, stop the communist offensive in our country and abroad, and abide by its promise to uphold the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter. What I ask for is not only a verbal statement, but also a factual statement. The greatest need at present is for our two countries to engage in frank discussions, and if possible, we should lay our cards on the table."

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered a speech in the Senate today, responding to the accusations made by Soviet representative Gromyko against the United States at the United Nations Security Council yesterday, and requested the Senate to pass military and financial aid to Greece and Turkey to avoid continuous repercussions that would endanger the peace and security of the entire world.

Aiding Greece and Turkey is Necessary

Although he did not mention Gromyko's name in his speech, he said that the $400 million aid plan was by no means "disregarding" the United Nations organization, but rather the greatest act of voluntary loyalty and complete adherence to the United Nations organization. From my point of view, giving the United Nations organization special tasks that it has no intention or is not prepared to undertake is enough to harm it. We should not ignore its joint affairs, but we should not assign it extra joint affairs and thus destroy its effectiveness. Under the current circumstances, Greece will fall into the communist sphere of influence, and there will be continuous and fatal repercussions on both sides. There are two reasons why the United Nations organization cannot handle the Greek and Turkish issues at present. First, the United Nations organization has never intended to become a relief organization in the past or present. Second, the United Nations organization has no military force as its backing. The latter is because the Soviet representative has not allowed this plan to be realized so far. If we pretend that the Greek and Turkish aid plan can be implemented once and for all and other aid can be ended, it is tantamount to deceiving ourselves. The United States' occupation responsibility in Korea will undoubtedly require active support. We must recognize the facts, otherwise, it may cause other situations, and as the shadows lengthen, they will clearly involve our own national happiness.

### Labor and Management Negotiate for Fifteen Hours; Improvement in US Telephone Workers' Strike; Resumption of Work Possible in One or Two Days

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 9th broadcast: US telephone workers and management have made great progress after fifteen hours of continuous negotiations, and work may resume within one or two days.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The US government mediator attempted to end the nationwide telephone workers' strike, so on the evening of the 8th, they urged representatives from both labor and management to hold a bargaining conference. However, striking worker representatives stated on the morning of the 9th that there was little hope for an early resolution to the labor dispute. However, Federal Mediation Director Warren stated on the morning of the 9th that efforts to resolve the labor strike were progressing very smoothly. More than 20,000 long-distance telephone workers are the backbone of the strike. It is reported that the ability of automatic telephone workers in major cities to continue working is quite uncertain. The union side stated that if the strike were to be prolonged, these workers would stop working within days. However, Labor Department officials stated that automatic telephone workers could generally continue to work.

### Preparatory Conference of International Trade Organization Opens; US Hopes to Achieve Reciprocal Trade Agreements

[US Information Service, Washington, 8th] The preparatory committee of the United Nations International Trade Organization, composed of eighteen countries, will convene in Geneva on April 10th. Acting Secretary of State Acheson expressed confidence in the meeting, stating, "This meeting will be a turning point for world trade and economic prosperity, bringing the world closer to the lasting peace we pray for day and night." Acheson mentioned at a press conference that the head of the US delegation, Director of Economic Affairs Clayton, had already departed for Geneva. Clayton hopes that the Geneva preparatory committee can complete the discussion of the charter of the World Trade Organization as scheduled, so that the results of the discussion can be submitted to the World Trade and Employment Conference to be held in the autumn. He also pointed out that another purpose of the Geneva meeting is to achieve reciprocal trade agreements to reduce barriers to world trade.

### Soviet Union Opposes Permanent Stationing of Investigation Team in Greece

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 9th] United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee Press Secretary Rian told reporters yesterday that the committee's plan to remain in Greece as a semi-permanent body has now been overturned due to opposition from the Soviet Union. It is reported that the committee now appears to be complying with certain demands of the Greek government.

### Reportedly an Agreement Reached Between Britain and the US; British Military Mission to Remain in Greece Pending the End of the Greek Government's Suppression Operations

[Reuters, London, 8th] Authoritative sources: Britain and the US reached an agreement yesterday stipulating that the British army, navy, and air force mission will continue to remain in Greece until the end of the Greek government forces' military operations to suppress the guerrillas. Although the exact duration of the stay is still under discussion between Britain and the US, it is expected that the stay may be longer than the end of the guerrilla suppression work. The purpose of the stay is to assist the US military and economic mission responsible for implementing the Truman Aid Plan to familiarize itself with the situation in Greece. The decision to extend the British mission's stay in Greece is the result of the delayed legislative procedures of the Truman Aid Plan. It is generally believed that the Greek government plans to complete the suppression of the guerrillas and the restoration of order this summer.

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] It is reported that British troops stationed in Greece have been actively reduced to 6,000 men in two brigades.

### Greek Government Forces Launch General Offensive Against Guerrillas

### Turkey to Publish White Paper

Stating Contributions to the United Nations During the War

[United Press, Ankara, 9th] As a result of the Soviet Union's recent attacks on Turkey, claiming that it did not participate in World War II, Turkey will publish a white paper to defend the usefulness of its wartime foreign policy and its contribution to the United Nations' stance. The content of the white paper cannot be known, as officials refuse to disclose it before its publication.

### Wallace Speaks Freely on US-Soviet Relations

[Report from this newspaper] London, 9th broadcast: Wallace delivered an important speech here today, stating briefly, "The next world war will cost the world trillions of dollars, and only a 'super New Deal' that spans the world can save this catastrophe. The US and the Soviet Union are now comparable to two wrestlers, probing each other before making a formal attack. The US and the Soviet Union are also comparable to two fierce dogs, probing each other with their noses before fighting each other. Whether a world war will come again will be clear in the next three months. When the two giants fight, Western Europe will bear the brunt. Currently, the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union are all pursuing their imperialist expansion policies, which will inevitably lead to war unless the US and the Soviet Union reach an understanding. But if the United States does not stop manufacturing atomic bombs, there is absolutely no possibility of obtaining the Soviet Union's understanding.

### US Aircraft Industry Lacks Production Capacity

Possibly Due to the Sabotage of Communists

[United Press, Wichita, Kansas, 9th] Shaffer, general manager of the Boeing Aircraft Company's Wichita plant, stated today that the production capacity of the US aircraft industry is currently insufficient, possibly due to the sabotage of communist forces within the government. President Truman is now determined to eliminate these forces. The Wichita Boeing Aircraft Plant was originally designed and built at a cost of $48 million. Its equipment for manufacturing B-29 Superfortress aircraft was destroyed by government order within weeks of Japan's surrender in 1945. If the United States had maintained this equipment, its position in the negotiations in Moscow would be much stronger.

### US Coal Miners' Strike; Lewis Becomes More Accommodating

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] US Miners' Union President Lewis sent a letter to the presidents of local branches today, stating: Since the government sent personnel to inspect coal mines across the country, some coal mines have resumed work because the inspection officials declared them safe. He is very pleased with the large output after the resumption of work in these coal mines. Other coal mines should also resume production once government inspection officials prove that their situation complies with safety regulations. Those in the know believe that this letter from Lewis is intended to refute in advance the outside criticism that miners violated the government's ban in November of last year and stopped working. The Federal Court is scheduled to hear the Miners' Union case tomorrow to determine whether the union has complied with the government's order. If Judge Goldsborough's ruling is in favor of the Miners' Union, the union will be able to recover $2.8 million of the $3.5 million in fines previously imposed on it.

### Heard Gromyko Agreed to Strict Control of Atomic Energy; Representatives Investigate the True Meaning of the Soviet Plan

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] According to reliable sources today, Soviet representative Gromyko has stated in a secret meeting of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission working group that he is willing to accept strict supervision and control of atomic energy, from the ore stage to the final step of nuclear fuel. As a result, the report approved by the other ten countries of the Atomic Energy Commission in December of last year has now been accepted by the Soviet Union. The working group decided to continue a detailed review of the Soviet Union's atomic control plan next Monday. There are two key points: (1) An immediate convention should be established to prohibit the use of atomic bombs and stipulate the destruction of existing atomic bombs. (2) Another convention should be signed to establish an international control system and handle it within the scope of the Security Council.

Gromyko's plan is very different from the US Baruch proposal approved by ten countries in June of last year, which assigns all atomic regulations to a control agency to exercise its duties under the supervision of the Security Council, where the five major powers have veto power. The US plan advocates establishing an international atomic development agency with full authority to handle atomic energy in all regions and to swiftly punish those who violate the rules, and the five major powers shall not exercise their veto power on atomic energy issues. It is reported that Gromyko told the representatives that the Soviet Union advocated that all parties unconditionally implement strict supervision and effective control. As for the suggestion in the first report of the Atomic Energy Commission that such supervision include airspace flights, it was rejected. He insisted that the atomic control agency could obtain factory lists from the governments of various countries. The representatives fired a barrage of questions at Gromyko, pursuing the exact meaning of the Soviet plan. According to a well-informed source, US Deputy Representative Osborn questioned Gromyko how he could know how many atomic factories there are without investigation. He felt dissatisfied with Gromyko's response. Finally, Gromyko claimed that this question was not genuinely related to the current discussion and turned to ask Osborn whether the United States opposed the Soviet proposal. The debate ended there, and it is reported that Osborn is prepared to continue questioning him tomorrow.

### Three Major Fires in the City Overnight; Fierce Flames at Maochang Warehouse Not Extinguished; Nearly 100 Billion in Goods Lost; 200 Firefighters Dispatched, Seven Injured; Mayor Wu and Acting Director Yu Personally Arrived to Investigate

[Report from this newspaper] After an unprecedented fire suddenly broke out at the Maochang Warehouse on Nanzun Road at 0:20 yesterday morning, two more fires occurred in the city in the middle of the night. In addition to the Maochang Warehouse fire, which was the most intense and has been burning for more than 24 hours, with losses of nearly 100 billion, the other two fires, one on Yangshuo Road and one on Huanghe Road, also caused extremely heavy losses. The entire family of six at No. 52, Yangshuo Road, Xin Kaihe, were all buried in the fire pit after a fire broke out at 3:30 AM yesterday. The fire at No. 8, Lane 327, Huanghe Road, also caused extremely large losses.

The fire at the Maochang Company Warehouse on Nanzun Road, after burning for four hours yesterday morning, spread from the second floor to the third floor, and at 4:00 AM, flames burst out of the tough lead roof. At the same time, the part of the warehouse along Qingpu Road was also successively engulfed in the sea of fire, and with the wind adding to the fire's power, it became even more uncontrollable. At about 5:30, the entire lead roof collapsed and collapsed, and in an instant, the flames soared into the sky, and even Pudong and other places several miles away could be clearly seen. Firefighters at the scene did their best to extinguish the fire in order to prevent the fire from spreading to nearby residential buildings (especially the municipal buildings along Daming Road to the west, which were only separated by one lane). At about 8:00, Ren Shuheng, a firefighter from the Hongkou District Fire Brigade, accidentally lost his footing while dodging flying iron sheets and fell from a nearby roof, suffering a serious head injury. At 9:00, Wang Fengbing, Wang Shouxin, and central firefighters Wang Junquan, Tao Chi, Tang Xiqing, and Wang Youshun were successively injured in various parts of their heads, chests, hands, and feet by falling cement tiles and bricks. Although the remaining firefighters were in such a difficult situation, they were still able to stick to their posts, and dozens of nearby municipal buildings were safe. The fire began to slow down after 10:00, but the large amount of cotton, electrical materials from the Telecommunications Bureau, and leftover materials and Western medicines stored by "UNRRA" and "CNRRA" in the north, as well as Maochang Company's own fresh eggs and egg yolks that were about to be shipped abroad, continued to burn until late last night.

When the fire was raging yesterday morning, nearby residents, fearing that they would be affected, moved their important clothes to the sidewalk on the west side of Daming Road for the night. The Hongkou Police Precinct sent a large number of police officers to cut off traffic in the surrounding area from morning to 4:00 PM to provide protection, so the British-owned trams on routes 7, 8, and 10 all stopped running yesterday, and traffic only resumed after 4:00 PM, but pedestrians were still prohibited from passing through.

Mayor Wu and Acting Director Yu expressed great concern and personally arrived at the fire scene to investigate when the fire was raging yesterday morning, and only left after 6:00. Acting Director Yu also visited the fire scene again at 5:00 PM in the afternoon to give instructions on everything, expressing surprise at the Maochang Warehouse fire and the other two fires that occurred at the same time yesterday morning, saying that it had never happened since he took over the police station.

According to Zhou Zhaoxiang, director of the Fire Department: if there are no accidents, the Maochang fire is expected to be completely extinguished today. The Fire Department dispatched more than 200 firefighters this time, dispatching nearly 20 fire trucks, lighting trucks, etc. Upon hearing the news, the US military fire brigade and the port fire brigade also voluntarily arrived at the scene one after another to assist in the firefighting.

The Maochang Company warehouse fire did not go out for a day and a night, and firefighters bravely extinguished the fire, causing the nearby streets to be flooded (photo by this newspaper)

### Nine People Involved in the Warehouse Detained

The Hongkou Police Precinct detained Maochang Company Deputy Manager Jiang Fuheng, Storage and Transportation Room Director Wang Chengde, and Nanzun Road Warehouse ground floor person in charge Yang Shisheng, second floor person in charge Sheng Jiadong, Telecommunications Bureau staff Song Chunquan, watchmen Jiang Yongyao, Zheng Huazhong, Russian constable Pan Teshi Afu, Fulaike Qu Fu, and other nine people yesterday for investigation.

The first floor of the warehouse was leased by the Ministry of Transportation Telecommunications Bureau, Hongyun Shipping Bureau, and Soviet merchant You Ning Company. The northwest part of the second floor along Nanzun Road was the warehouse of the Ministry of Transportation Telecommunications Bureau and the Meili Foreign Company. The eastern part was stacked with more than 700 large boxes of leftover materials shipped from Okinawa Island by "UNRRA" and Western medicines from "CNRRA". Except for a small part of the third floor where Weihuo Foreign Company stored sundries, the rest was Maochang Company's refrigeration equipment, and chickens and egg yolks that were about to be shipped abroad. Preliminary loss estimates (excluding the ground floor): Maochang Company's refrigeration equipment was 25 billion yuan, the Telecommunications Bureau about 7 billion yuan (one saying about 25 billion), and the loss figures for "UNRRA" and "CNRRA" were probably around 50 billion yuan, so the loss in this fire can be described as an unprecedented disaster in recent decades.

### Seventeen Dead and Injured at Xiaodongmen; Housing and Goods Losses Estimated at 700 Million Yuan

[Report from this newspaper] No. 52, Yangshuo Street, Xiaodongmen, Nanshi, is a five-bay three-story house. The lower floor houses the Fengchang North Goods Store and the Dai Xin North Goods Store, and the second and third floors house more than a dozen households and Shen Zhuang. At about 3:30 yesterday morning, Zhang Honghua's family (who opened the Hongwen Shen Zhuang) on the third floor, because they entertained guests the day before for the Qingming Festival, put a coal briquette stove on the third floor corridor. It burned from morning to 11:00 PM before it was extinguished. Because it had been burning for too long, the wooden wall next to the stove was dry and charred. It may have been that a spark fell and burned through the floor, extending to the second floor corridor, which led to a huge fire. At that time, the Yimiao Police Precinct received the report and notified the Fire Department to rush to the rescue. At the time, the residents were all asleep. When they woke up in shock, the fire was already raging. Those who jumped out of windows and jumped from buildings to escape and were injured included Zhang Liantian, Wang Zucheng, Tang Weiqing, Zhao Dingchang, Zhang Yuanguang, Luo Zhongbiao, Zhang Linfeng, Jin Mantang, Zhang Honghua, Shi Huilong, and Liu Gencai. The most tragic was Zhang Honghua's family, as six people were unable to escape and were all burned to death, namely Zhang Cai's wife, Zhang Hong's wife, Liu Zhang's wife, Zhang Libao, Zhang Juxian, and Liu Yuqing. The injured were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by the Yimiao Precinct. The charred corpses were sent to the autopsy site. Shen Deheng, Chen Jingshan, Zhou Nan, and Wang Jianxian, section chiefs of the Yimiao Precinct, all came to the fire scene in person to maintain order and investigate the fire, so the surrounding order was good, enabling the firefighters to do their best to extinguish the fire. The fire took three hours to extinguish. Deputy Director Yu of the General Bureau also rushed to urge the extinguishing.

It was found that the No. 52 house was completely destroyed, and together with the two North Goods Stores downstairs, the North-South goods and seafood, and the business assets, the loss was as high as 700 million. Fortunately, the companies had taken out large amounts of fire insurance.

### Huge Losses on Huanghe Road Too

[Report from this newspaper] No. 8, Lane 327, Huanghe Road, is a five-bay two-story house. The first building is rented to a Chinese and Western Pharmacy as a dormitory. The lower house of the second building is the Lida Screw Factory. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the back room attic, and suddenly the raging fire went straight to the stomach, out of control. The No. 23 floors were rented out to more than 30 households, and men, women, old, and young were all sound asleep. Suddenly hearing the fire alarm, they all fled for their lives. Xin Zha, Central, and other fire departments rushed to the scene with belt vehicles to spray water, but unfortunately the houses were old and the weather was dry. Once the fire reached the top, it spread very quickly, and it took about three hours to extinguish it. As a result, the five-bay two-story house was completely destroyed, and the fire also affected the adjacent No. 6 building.

### Citizens Should Pay Attention to Inspecting Old Electrical Wires

The continuous fires have caused huge losses. The garrison commander Xuan Tiewu, fearing that it would affect local security, decided to strengthen fire management, launch a building inspection in the short term, and work with the municipal government to launch a city-wide Baojia inspection of old electrical wires in households. The garrison headquarters has also formulated the following matters that should be paid attention to in maintaining electrical wires and avoiding fires: (1) If only the electrical wires are old and the outer wrapping is not broken, there is no risk of electrical leakage causing a fire. (2) If the outer wrapping of the old electrical wires is broken and damaged, the current has no insulation resistance and is extremely prone to electrical leakage causing a fire. (3) If the outer wrapping is broken and the insulation and resistance effect is lost, the electricity will leak from the gaps where there is no wrapping.

### Arsonist Apprehended in Nanjing

Huadong News Agency: A fire broke out in the Dapubiao factory area a month ago, burning for eight hours, destroying factories and causing losses of over 10 billion. At the time, the fire was considered strange, and there seemed to be a smell of sulfur during the burning. It was suspected that it was arson. Yesterday, the local authorities received an urgent telegram from the Capital Garrison Headquarters, saying that the headquarters had captured an arsonist named Zhang Liangrong a week ago. He confessed that he planned to take the opportunity to commit arson in Nanjing to disrupt local order. He also confessed that he caused the fire in the Shanghai factory area a month ago. There are still a large number of bandits hiding in Shanghai, attempting to commit arson and disrupt local security.

It is also learned that when the bandits commit arson, they soak a large amount of cotton cloth in gasoline or kerosene, and then put it in a medium-sized cattail bag or mix it with sulfur gunpowder.

After several discussions between Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, as well as the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government Advisory Committee, it was generally agreed that in view of the current position of the municipal government in welcoming foreign investment by the central government, it would be appropriate to allow it to continue operating unless it is necessary.

However, the municipal government is currently preparing a unified transportation plan for the city, and the company should cooperate with the municipal government in the spirit of Sino-British cooperation to complete this plan and seek its implementation. As for the contract, considering the current environment, many of its provisions are no longer applicable and must be revised and re-signed. In addition, the company's management is not entirely satisfactory, so the company is also ordered to appoint responsible personnel to discuss the revision matters, with the aim of re-signing before October 10 this year. At the same time, management should be improved and equipment should be expanded as much as possible, so that there are sufficient vehicles operating in the urban area to meet public needs.

### Occupied for Thirteen Years, Recovered Only Today, Let's See Such Yan'an.

The Central Film Studio sent cameraman Shen Weikang to Yan'an to film after the National Army recovered Yan'an. The film has been fully edited and titled "Such Yan'an", and will be shown in the "Xindu", "Dahua" in the capital, and the "Queen" and "Guanghua" cinemas in Shanghai starting today. The content of the film first describes the CCP's lack of sincerity in participating in peace talks, with all liaison personnel withdrawing from Nanjing and Shanghai. It then describes the Communist army launching an offensive in response to the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, only to be counterattacked by the National Army. In less than seven days, the army went straight to Yan'an, revealing the face of this small red city that had been occupied by the Communist army for thirteen years. The film provides a systematic dissection and record of the overall appearance of Yan'an, the cave dwellings, the scenery of the Yan River, and the central organs of the CCP. What is intriguing is the magnificent residence of the CCP's top leaders, with actual footage of Mao Zedong's wife, Lan Ping, participating in film work in the past inserted in the middle. The final scene shows the National Army and the local people who have returned from refuge cooperating sincerely to jointly revive northern Shaanxi.

### Husband of Movie Star Wu Guozhang Detained, Stuttering Defense, Denies Supplying Cotton to the Enemy.

[This Newspaper's Report] Wu Guozhang, the husband of Zhou Manhua, a female movie star from the puppet Huaying company, was tried in the High Court yesterday morning on charges of supplying cotton to the enemy. Wu is 36 years old, from Nanhui, a graduate of Great China University, and lives at No. 11 Renheli, Baike Road, in this city. He opened Yuansheng Flower Factory in Nanhui and served as the manager of Maochang Flower Shop, which was attached to the Maoxin Yarn Factory in Renheli, Xizang Road. In April of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), the defendant purchased 200 frames of cotton (i.e., 500 dan) and sold it to the Japanese merchant Yoshida Yoko. Afterwards, there were multiple sales of scattered quantities. After the victory, because there was no transaction, on August 24 of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), Maochang transferred more than 90 million yuan of counterfeit currency from Yoshida's account to Yuansheng's flower fund to close the account. This was discovered by the former Military Statistics Bureau's Shanghai office, which sent a letter to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation and filed a public prosecution on suspicion of treason. Wu suffers from a stutter and had difficulty giving his defense in the High Court yesterday. He firmly denied the charge of aiding the enemy, saying that Yoshida Yoko was a purely commercial firm, that brokers connected the buying and selling of goods, and that the delivery location was at Zhajiang near Minhang. He only knew that he was doing business and did not admit to aiding the enemy. After the court hearing, because Wu's case was serious, he was originally released on bail. Yesterday, the court ordered him to be detained in the High Court detention center for further investigation.

Chen defended himself in the High Court yesterday afternoon, claiming that his confession at the North Station Branch of the Police Bureau was obtained under torture and was not credible. He said that he had taken Yishenglei of Hangzhou Chenghuang Mountain as his teacher and had always been engaged in astrology, and had no contact with the enemy. During his response, he spoke in a lot of jargon, including "The body is not difficult to set up a stall, the stall is inseparable from the body, sitting in a shop does not leave the counter, sitting at a stall does not leave the stall." He also said, "My profession does not require capital, only a pen and a mouth, which are inexhaustible, and are varied and fanciful."

The task was completed at 3:00 PM and returned to the company. When driving to the main gate of this Tong and turning right to enter the gate, Tongji University's No. 7 school bus was turning left to exit. The driver of that car did not make a wide turn, causing the front fender of car No. 02706 to be damaged. The driver was responsible for the accident, so he beckoned the school bus to stop for negotiations. Unexpectedly, the car ignored him and drove straight out. At a distance of more than 200 meters from the gate, because the area was the dormitory of Tongji Freshmen's College, the car stopped. The people got on and off. The driver saw that the school bus had stopped, so he turned the car around and chased it to that location to reason with the driver of the school bus. Unexpectedly, it aroused the intervention of the students in the car, who wanted to beat the soldier. The soldier had no choice but to drive the car back to the company. Unexpectedly, the school bus also rushed back to the parking lot of this camp, intending to catch the driver of car No. 02706. While they were arguing, Wang Yunquan, a member of the Student Self-Government Association of Tongji Law School, notified Yao Runyu, the adjutant of this company, to go and mediate. Adjutant Yao rushed to the scene and severely reprimanded the soldiers of this company on the spot and immediately ordered them back to the company. There was no mass fight and no students were injured. Later, a peaceful solution was reached with Wang Guangquan, the responsible representative of the Law School Self-Government Association, and both sides expressed their apologies to each other. In the evening around 7:00 PM, Li, the director of training at Tongji University, came to the company to inquire about the dispute, and the details were also explained, and the misunderstanding between them had been cleared. The facts are as described above. The students of Tongji University suddenly went on strike yesterday, and I don't know what their intentions are."

The tickets are currently being stamped with a hard seal and can be fully issued before the end of the month, to be distributed by each district. According to the person in charge of the council, the original budget last year was 200 million yuan per school. Due to soaring prices, it is feared that this will be insufficient, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will generously donate for the sake of cultivating talents for the country, so that it can exceed the original target.

### The Chinese Linguistics Society Held its First Board Meeting Yesterday

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The first board meeting of the Chinese Linguistics Society was held at 3:00 PM yesterday on the fourth floor of the Kaiming Bookstore. Many board members, including Ye Shengtao, Chen Wangdao, Zhou Yutong, Zhang Xichen, and Fang Guangtao, attended. Chen Wangdao was elected as the chairman of the society, Fang Guangtao as the director of the Research Department, and Zhang Xichen as the director of the General Affairs Department. It was also decided to prepare for the establishment of a society venue, enrich the library facilities, and actively promote the work. According to reports, Chen and others had organized the Chinese Language Education Society in 1938, with the aim of studying the Chinese language and improving Chinese language education. The society is now undergoing significant personnel changes, and therefore a separate organization, the Chinese Linguistics Society, was initiated and established on the second of last month, in order to continue studying the basic problems of society. The full text of the society's origin is recorded below:

"The issue of language and writing is a fundamental issue in our social life. We rely on language and writing to conduct social life.

Whether our understanding of language and writing is accurate and whether our handling of it is appropriate often have a significant impact on our social life. If we hope that social life will gradually progress and move towards brightness, we must strive to pursue accuracy and appropriateness.

In modern China, there are many language issues that have not been resolved. Regarding the principles of language, most need to be introduced and clarified. For each issue, there are different views, which need to be discussed and agreed upon to find a common path. The colleagues believe that in addition to our own efforts in research, there is also a need to gather wisdom and explore together. Therefore, this Chinese Linguistics Society is organized in Shanghai, hoping that participating friends will further explore and introduce the principles from the study of practical language problems. We hope that friends with the same aspirations will enthusiastically participate and work together to make our contribution to the language of modern China."

### Publications Should Indicate the Price and Publisher; Order from the Ministry of the Interior to Rectify

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Air Mail] The publication law clearly stipulates that publications should include the name of the publisher and indicate the price.

Some books for sale do not include the name of the publishing agency or the name of the publisher, and some do not indicate the price, with the selling price varying at any time, which is a major abuse.

### How to Implement "Educational Travel": This is a Teaching Activity Worth Promoting and Implementing

— Ma Jingxuan

Spring is here. Spring is the season for educational travel. Teachers in various schools, as usual, lead students to visit parks, temples, mountains, forests, fields, and scenic areas outside the school, in order to expand students' knowledge and increase their knowledge. Therefore, educational travel is also called off-campus teaching.

Recently, when I met with colleagues from various schools, we often talked about the implementation of educational travel. Below is a specific plan that can be used as a reference for schools during implementation.

How to implement educational travel? I believe that the travel destination should first be determined according to the age of the students. If the location is far away, it is not suitable for young students. Secondly, the travel expenses should be determined according to the economic situation of the students' families. If a large amount of travel expenses are required, some students from poor families will be unable to participate.

Once the location is determined and the expenses are low, all students can participate. It is necessary to further formulate a plan for educational travel, such as what preparations should be made in advance? What should be paid attention to when departing? What should be done after returning to school? Then, guide the students to practice one by one.

(A) Preparations before departure: Before the educational travel departs, the following preparations should be made: (1) Items to be prepared: For individuals - bedding (one for every two people), woolen sweaters, cleaning supplies, rain gear, pencils, notebooks, small knives, school badges, extra money, etc. For groups - maps, school photos, school flags, whistles, roll call lists, emergency medicines, collection boxes, account books, travel expenses, etc. (2) Organizations to be established: The entire team should have a general captain to manage roll call and maintain discipline. Each small team should have a small team leader to manage the order of the small team during the visit. In addition, there should be emergency, accounting, and administrative staff to undertake the work that the entire team should do. (3) Matters to be known: You must know the route to and from, you must know the general situation of the destination, you must know the procedures and budget for boat, car, accommodation, and meals.

(B) The following matters should be noted when departing: (1) It is best to wear short clothes and wear a school badge. (2) The following rules should be observed: (1) When walking in a line, walk on the right, pay attention to advancing, stand still and wait for the whistle, (2) Do not approach dangerous places in the boat or car, and obey the orders of the leader, (3) When visiting, do not go outside the designated area, do not take dangerous actions, pay attention to the assembly whistle and location, (4) In the accommodation, do not leave without the teacher's permission, do not rush to drink tea, and do not buy miscellaneous food. (3) Record the experiences along the way, collect specimens of animals, plants, and minerals at any time, and preserve them properly. After a day of visiting, write a letter to report to the parents and organize the notes.

(C) After returning to school, use methods such as reporting, questioning, discussion, writing, painting, and production to correct students' observational errors or supplement their lack of observation. (1) The representative will report the travel process during the commemorative week. (2) Publish travel notes or travelogues in the school magazine or daily newspaper. (3) Draw good landscape paintings in the labor and art class, make collection items, and hold a periodic exhibition of educational travel results. (4) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this trip, (5) Settle the personal and group expenses of this trip.

Educational travel can enable students to learn hardship, endure poverty, cultivate the morality of mutual assistance, promote the spirit of autonomy, and enhance the feelings between teachers and students and the friendship of classmates. Especially after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the development of self-reliance and construction in various places can further encourage students to study hard, move forward, and have the ambition to fly outwards. This is a teaching activity worth promoting and implementing. I hope that school colleagues will not give up this opportunity.

### A Record of the Shanghai Hu Xing Ping Pong Team's Southern Expedition; Nine Wins and Two Losses, Excellent Results

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou Air Mail] The Shanghai Hu Xing Ping Pong Team arrived in Hong Kong on the 18th of last month. Starting on the 20th, the Macau and Guangzhou fans went to Hong Kong to see the team's skills, so the situation was fierce and sensational for a while. Those who came because of the name were extremely crowded.

In Macau

On the 24th, the Shanghai team led the division to Macau. The fans of Guangzhou and Hong Kong teams rushed to Macau, because Macau's ping pong skills have always been above those of Guangzhou and Hong Kong. On the 25th, the Shanghai team first played against the Nanzhong team. The players of the Nanzhong team were assisted by the elite players of the Tao Ying team, with strong strength, including Liang Wenhuan, Hu Jinying, Luo Jinzhen, Lin Jinyuan, and Liang Huantang, all-round elite players. There were many wonderful scenes in the performance of both sides, and the audience was amazed. However, the Nanzhong team's points stopped rising at ten points, and the Shanghai team won in one go, winning 13 to 10. On the 26th, the Shanghai team fought against South China. South China and Nanzhong have similar technologies. Wang Xitian, Lu Nau, Huang Yongnian, Huang Yong'an, and Ma Hanrong are even more skilled in both offense and defense. The Shanghai team was extremely hard to play, and the performance was more interesting than Nanzhong. As a result, 13 to 9, the Shanghai team defeated two heroes in a row. On the 27th, the Macau League General Point Dou defeated Hu Xing. The Governor of Macau personally went to watch the game. The Macau League selected the best players to defend and attack. Starting at 7 pm, a big battle unfolded. The Shanghai stars did not dare to neglect. I don't know how much time it took between each game and each point to end a game. The Shanghai stars' fierce attack, each point could not be resolved without more than 40 shots. Occasionally, the Shanghai stars' offensive was slightly weaker, and the Macau team launched a counterattack. Their bouncing or drawing balls were agile and powerful, often making the Shanghai stars unable to parry. Lu Nau, a general from the Han League team, has always had the reputation of a cannonball, and the performance was excellent. The most lively of the whole team was Wang Xitian, the "Little Overlord". His ability to chop the ball is the champion of Hong Kong and Macau. His killing board and shrinking ball are hard to beat in Sanfu. The counter-draws and bouncing balls of Hu Jinying, and the offense and defense of Luo Jinzhen and Ma Hanrong, all gave the Shanghai team the biggest blow. The two sides fought until 2 am, and the number of games was still twelve to twelve. Finally, Huang Zhijun of Hu Xing and Ma Hanrong of the Macau League played the final. Ma Hanrong made a spurt of energy and won several cities in a row, defeating Huang Zhijun with 21 to 15. After the game, both sides were exhausted and could not afford to speak.

In Guangzhou

On the 29th, the Shanghai Star team went to Guangzhou to compete. Since Guangzhou's restoration, ping pong leadership has not been obtained, so interest is not high. All the generals have never practiced. On that day, they first fought against the Puyou team. Although Puyou had Liang Zhuohui, the former Hong Kong singles champion, Feng Guohao, the team champion, Yu Zumian, the pillar of Macau's Sui Ying, Luo Wenhui, a Tao Ying player, and Zhong Enrong, a famous player in Guangzhou, his strength was originally strong, but he had not had the opportunity to practice for several years, and his skills were unfamiliar, so he lost 2 to 13 to Hu Xing. On the 30th, Qianghua took the field. All the generals of Qianghua are Guangzhou's famous people. Tao Ying's new general Li Huagui was added, which was originally extraordinary, but except for Li Huagui, the rest had been neglecting practice for a long time, and the performance was not wonderful. Only Li Huagui fought bravely and won the most outstanding Wang Youxin and Lu Hanjun of Hu Xing, and only won two points for Qianghua. The result was 13 to 2, and the Shanghai team won. On the 31st, the Puqiang United Team challenged. The United Team had Liang Zhuohui, Fu Zongkun, Yu Zumian, Li Huagui, and Hu Guoliang on the field, but still lost 13 to 2.

After the Shanghai Star team finished each game, they took the Guangzhou-Kowloon Express to Hong Kong on the morning of April 1, and then returned to Shanghai by boat. The team was welcomed by Guangzhou Mayor Ouyang Ju. Governor of Macau Wei Yila, Hong Kong Governor Luo Fuguo, etc. (Lei Xuexin sent from Guangzhou)

Northeast Soybeans Arrive in Shanghai

[Report from our newspaper] Director Wu of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau told reporters yesterday that, in order to stabilize the price of edible oil in the city, the authorities will supply 8,000 tons of soybeans from the Northeast each month, starting this month. The 8,000 tons of soybeans for this month have already arrived here. Yesterday (the 8th), 1,000 tons were released to be distributed to various oil factories first. The distribution ratio is based on the production volume of each oil factory. Regarding rice, the government currently maintains a reserve of 50,000 tons in the city to regulate surpluses and deficits, so the supply of rice can be guaranteed. The price standards for various major daily necessities will be discussed and determined at the Shanghai Municipal Price Review Committee meeting to be held tomorrow (the 10th).

Oil Prices Continue to Rise by Over 10,000 Yuan

[Another Report] Yesterday, the oil market continued to rise steadily. Raw oil advanced by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan, while refined oil continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil soared by 120,000 yuan, while soybean oil had already reached a fixed price.

It was recommended that Chen Jingmin, the chairman of the association, negotiate with the Securities Exchange authorities. (3) It was decided to establish a brokers' association and elect twelve people to be responsible for promoting the association's affairs. In the future, a dinner party will be held every half month or month to replace the general meeting of all members.

### Thorough Investigation of Warehouse Inventory; Taiwan Sugar Distribution Suspended This Week

[Report from our newspaper] The relevant authorities are quite concerned about the repeated price increases in the sugar market in recent days. An investigation revealed that sugar merchants have a considerable amount of sugar stored in their warehouses, and there is no shortage. Therefore, it was decided to thoroughly investigate the warehouses. If non-sugar merchants are found to be hoarding sugar, they will be dealt with appropriately. It is also rumored that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has sent a document to Taiwan Sugar Company due to the recent fluctuations in the sugar market, ordering the temporary suspension of sugar distribution for this week. The new distribution method will be decided at the Price Review Committee meeting to be held today.

### Slack Trade in White Coal

The coal market is quiet for white coal lumps, and trade is slack. The trend of white coal dust is very weak due to the sluggish sales of coal balls. The coal market is still in a weak trend, and the market price is also hovering at a low level.

### Large Quantities of Salt Shipped to Hankou

[Report from our newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ling Ge ship brought 4,000 tons of salt from Xiuyu last Sunday, which will soon be transferred to a ship bound for Hankou. In addition, the Deng Yu ship brought 4,050 tons of salt from Tanggu, Tianjin, the day before yesterday, and will return to Hankou today. The Jiang Hua ship is also loaded with 1,800 tons of salt and will sail to Hankou today. The Jiang Jian ship is loaded with 1,000 tons and will sail to Hankou tomorrow.

### Bank Associations Organize Syndicates; Can Be Established with Three Members

[Report from our newspaper] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee held its second meeting at the National Bank yesterday afternoon, chaired by Chairman Qin Runxiang. Five important cases were discussed: (1) The loan review outline submitted by the Industrial Loan and Export Material Loan Review Committees was reviewed. It was decided that committee members Luo Qinghua and Ju Yihong would first conduct the review. (2) For banks that do not have a deposit reserve of 200 million yuan, the original rule required a syndicate of seven banks. This has now been changed to a syndicate of three banks. (3) The original regulation required banks to find guarantors for the transfer of mortgages and rediscounting business. It has now been decided that guarantors are not required. (4) The application of Yaxiya, Qian Tai, and China Industrial and Mining Bank to organize a syndicate to handle the transfer of mortgages and rediscounting business was reviewed and approved. (5) For loan applications that are too large, exceeding 500 million yuan, and cannot be handled by one bank alone, it was decided to jointly underwrite the loan by several banks.

### Stabilizing Prices and Punishing Speculation; Police Bureau Formulates Concrete Measures; To Be Implemented Upon Approval

[Report from the Central News Agency in this city] Concrete measures to stabilize prices and punish speculation and manipulation have been formulated by the Economic Section of the Police Bureau and will be formally implemented upon approval. The measures are divided into four categories:

Cotton Yarn

Regulations stipulate that yarn merchants should fill in transaction forms when buying and selling cotton yarn. Non-yarn merchants are not allowed to buy or sell. Purchased cotton yarn must be cleared immediately. Overdue warehouse receipts will be canceled. Warehouse receipts must specify the name of the borrower to prevent hoarding. The Textile Construction Management Committee should do its best to suppress yarn prices and regulate supply and demand.

Rayon

Rayon transactions should be accurately recorded on transaction forms so that rayon customers can verify whether there are private resales into hoarding and black market channels. The China Trust Bureau should have statistics on the supply and sales of rayon and maintain sufficient reserves.

Rice

The Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau bears the heavy responsibility of regulating the city's rice surplus and deficit. Supply and demand should be balanced to stabilize rice prices. Even if there are fluctuations, they should be limited. Amidst today's rising prices, strict investigation of hoarding is necessary to stabilize the people's food supply.

Sugar

Personnel will be dispatched to investigate whether sugar companies are colluding with sugar merchants to manipulate grain prices, and to encourage reporting of black market sugar transactions and hoarding.

After Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu announced the day before yesterday that he would assist Mayor Wu in suppressing the city's soaring prices, all staff members of the Economic Group of the Inspection Department of the Garrison Command were ordered to be dispatched yesterday morning to monitor transactions in various markets. Zhang Yamin, the head of the group, convened brokers in the yarn and cloth market before the opening of trading and earnestly explained the government's determination to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, urging them to abide by national laws and not engage in manipulation or speculation. He also instructed Tang Zhiliang, the chairman of the industry association, to be responsible for suppressing and stabilizing the price of yarn and cloth.

Yesterday, under the strict supervision of the military and police authorities, trading in the yarn and cloth market turned weak, and the price drop in the cotton yarn market was even more severe.

Also: The Garrison Command arrested two yarn merchants in the cotton yarn market yesterday for manipulating yarn prices and engaging in black market transactions. As the case involves a wide range of issues, details are not yet available for publication.

According to Mr. Zhang, the recent rise in general prices is mostly due to illegal merchants hoarding goods for profit. The situation in the cotton yarn market is very complicated, and black market trading outside the market has a significant impact on market prices. He is personally patrolling today, and any speculative or illegal transactions will be severely punished according to the law.

### First Meeting of the Fund Supervisory Standing Committee Held Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The first standing committee meeting of the 36-year short-term treasury bill and US dollar bond fund supervisory committee was held in the Central Bank's conference room yesterday afternoon. Standing committee members and chairman Li Fusen, standing committee members Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Wu Rencang, and Chen Bingzhang attended. President Zhang of the National Bank and committee members Xu Yongzuo and Ouyang Lun also attended. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. Two main agenda items: (1) Drafting the committee's operating rules, planning to establish the following groups under the committee: (A) Fund Custody Group, (B) Industrial Supervision Group. (2) Drafting a proposal to the government regarding maintaining bond credit. It is rumored that the committee's office will be located in the Bank Association Building on Hong Kong Road in this city.

### Black Market for Newsprint Everywhere; Hope for Relaxation of Import Quotas

[Report from our newspaper] It is reported that half of the 3,000-ton newsprint import quota for the newspaper industry in this city between February and April has been approved for import. The remaining half is expected to be approved for import before the end of this month. As for the 4,050-ton import quota for the book industry between February and April, the amount requested by each bookstore is quite fragmented. They are waiting for the bookstores to form a certain tonnage application before the importing firms can place orders on their behalf. It is rumored that Canada, the world's newsprint supplier, is also adopting a distribution system for newsprint to various countries around the world, and there is a fixed quota for our country. The delivery price for this allocated newsprint at the Shanghai port is US$160 per ton. However, the black market price in Shanghai, including tariffs and transportation costs, has reached US$350 per ton. The delivery price for this allocated newsprint in various parts of the United States is US$84 per ton. However, the black market price in the United States has also reached US$200 per ton. The black market price in San Francisco has reached US$225 per ton. If, due to our country's import quota restrictions, the allocated quota of cheap newsprint is transferred to other countries, the result would be a huge loss to our country's economic and cultural circles. Therefore, relevant parties hope that the import control authorities should relax the import quota for this cheap newsprint as much as possible.

[Another Report] In the past week, foreign merchants have initiated the procurement and transportation of newsprint, and prices have gradually risen, with each ream priced at 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. Among foreign merchants, those from the north are the most active, as the northern seaports have only recently thawed. Procurement in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places is also becoming more active. It is also known that a considerable amount of newsprint is transported from Hong Kong to various places via Guangzhou and Hankou. There was a time when newsprint in Hankou was so abundant that prices were lower than in Shanghai, resulting in newsprint being transported from Hankou to Shanghai for sale.

### Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee Discusses Numerous Important Cases

[Report from our newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting at the Central Bank President's Office yesterday afternoon, adjourning at about 7:00 PM. Numerous important cases were discussed, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Passed the contract for exporting dried eggs to the United Kingdom, totaling 250 tons of dried eggs, priced at £720 per ton. (2) Passed the handling method for re-exporting processed imported materials. (3) Passed the list of organization names for the semi-annual subcommittees. (4) Passed the establishment of Export Promotion Committee regional offices in Chongqing, Taiwan, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places. (5) Passed the list of organization names for the Finance Subcommittee, with Liu Gongyun as the convener and Shao Zenghua, Chen Changtong, Wang Botian, Zhang Yujiu, Gu Gengyu, Shou Jingwei, Ge Jingzhong as members, and Chen Xi as secretary. (5) Passed the promotion plan prepared by the Finance Association for the subcommittee. (6) Passed the loan plan to assist the Gejiu Tin Mine in Yunnan.

### Increase of Tea Pledge Loans; Agricultural Bank Began Processing Yesterday; Three-Month Term, 3% Interest

After the tea purchase method lost its effectiveness, the Central Bank, in order to support tea merchants, negotiated with the Agricultural Bank to allow tea merchants to increase pledge loans and submitted the plan to the Executive Yuan. It is now known that, in response to tea merchants' requests, the bank began processing the loans yesterday (the 9th) before the Executive Yuan approved them. Tea merchants are processing the procedures for increasing pledge loans, applying based on the predetermined quota and 80% of the predetermined pledge price for this year's new tea. The current pledge value of Qi Hong tea at the Agricultural Bank is 480,000 yuan per case, Tun Green 400,000 yuan, and Ping Green 320,000 yuan, with a term of three months and a monthly interest rate of 3%. It is rumored that other places can also apply for similar pledge loans.

[Another Report] According to Dai Mingjin, Assistant Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the China Agricultural Bank, tea loans totaling 13 billion yuan in legal tender were issued last year. Recently, the government, taking into account the actual business difficulties of various tea merchants, has approved an increase in pledge loans, with the Shanghai branch increasing pledge loans by 71 billion yuan. The procedures began yesterday and will be completed in one week. More than 40 tea merchants in Shanghai have been granted loans, including China Jiuxing and Xinghua Tea Companies, which have received larger loan amounts.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Rises; Strong Buying Interest in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the bulls in Chinese stocks, led by bond issuers, repeatedly used the tactic of selling and then buying back, making the market struggle fiercely in the morning. In the afternoon, stimulated by the Hong Kong exchange rate, buying interest passively turned strong, and the bulls were successful.

When the market opened in the morning, it showed an upward trend and then a downward trend. Die Yong Yarn opened and fell from an outer market low of 2,810 yuan to 2,760 yuan. Later, it was forced down to 2,730 yuan. Then, No. 94 and others began to buy, and when 2,800 yuan was broken again, sentiment improved. The price rose to 2,860 yuan. Numbers 198, 141, 218 and 202 sold and returned to 2,820 yuan. At this time, Yonggong suddenly had a large number of buyers, with Numbers 89 and 223 making strong purchases, and Dongxing also had scattered buying activity. Both stocks showed considerable profits, and Yonggong once approached the limit up. Sentiment was still easy to stir, and Numbers 85, 196, 152, 35, 89, 145 and 179 were re-absorbed, rising to 2,880 yuan. Number 61 sold strongly at a high price, and Number 223 also supplied, and the afternoon closing fell back to around 2,820 yuan. As a result, Die Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya, Xinguang, Huafeng and Zhongfa fell slightly compared to the previous close. Xinhua fell by half a percent, and Qinxing rose slightly. The delivery exchange showed slight declines in Die Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhuo, Huafeng and Xinguang. Cold stock Yonggong rose to the limit, rising by 10% after a rebound. Matches fell by half a percent, and the remaining stocks showed mixed results.

Afternoon

Only spot delivery was made. Numbers 137, 13, 76, 198, 83 and 223 all sold and fell to 2,760 yuan. Numbers 94, 198, 14, 89, 145, 185, 99, 231, 223, 28, 232 and 154 bought up. Cement, Yonggong and National Products sequentially rose to the limit. It was reported that the Hong Kong exchange rate had risen, and sentiment suddenly became sensitive. Buying was extremely strong, and the market rose to 2,930 yuan. Numbers 223, 12 and 207 tended to supply at high prices, falling back to 2,890 yuan. However, the bulls repeatedly used the old trick of selling and then buying back, and the market price was still bought up by Numbers 224, 235, 197, 47, 46, 183, 106, 145 and 83 to 2,960 yuan. Underwear also rose to the limit. At the close, Numbers 117 and 61 continued to supply and sell, and the market slightly turned around. The asking prices after the close were slightly flat. As a result, Yong Yarn, Xinhuo, Meiya and Xinhua rose slightly compared to the previous close, while Huafeng, Xinguang, Qinxing and Zhongfa each rose by about half a percent. The delivery exchange showed slight declines in all stocks for the half-day trading. Cold stocks showed Yonggong, Underwear, Cement and National Products rising to the limit, Datong rising by 10%, and Commerce and Xinya each rising by slightly more than half a percent to slightly less than 10%. Zhongfang Tongyi rose by half a percent. Rongfeng did not have much trading, only showing flatness. The remaining stocks showed slight gains. Various stocks outside the market were extremely stable, while Zhonghua showed that demand was exceeding supply and prices continued to rise.

### Tea Market Unanimously Cuts Prices

The foreign tea market, which has long been in a state of fatigue, was unable to rally yesterday because buyers remained sluggish and sellers continued to peddle their goods. Chen Zhong Qimen was absorbed by British Jardine Matheson for over 400 cases at a price of 350,000 to 360,000 yuan per dan, a sharp drop of more than 100,000 yuan compared to last week. The rest were all cut in price. The domestic tea market remained flat, with no changes. However, with the increasing supply of Wenzhou Mingxin and Xin Longjing teas, holders gradually felt unable to support prices, and the price per dan fell back to the 1.2 million yuan mark, a further reduction of 300,000 yuan compared to the initial price. According to industry insiders, new goods from the production areas are still being shipped to Shanghai, and the bottom line is low and precarious.

### Whether Qian Zhuang Industry Should Be Included in the Banking Law

Shen Rixin and others will attend the Legislative Yuan meeting

Shen Rixin, Chairman of the Shanghai Qianye Association, and Lu Shuliang, Zou Rangqing, and two others left for Beijing last night to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting and make statements on whether the Qian Zhuang industry should be included in the Banking Law.

### Reorganization of the Export Control System Completed; Work Gradually Intensifying

It is rumored that another meeting will be held next Friday.

### Central Cooperative Treasury Shanghai Branch Changes Check Clearing Number; New Number is 50; Effective from the 15th

The Shanghai Branch of the Central Cooperative Treasury was established relatively late, and the check clearing number at that time was 87, which was a check clearing delivery. Recently, it has been deeply felt that check clearing delivery is inconvenient. The Banking and Money Industry Association has agreed to transfer the original number 50 of the clearing house to the branch, and the clearing house will create a special number to promote the branch's participation in direct clearing, which will be implemented on the 15th of this month.

### Pawnshops Request Loans

[Report from our newspaper] In order to adapt to the current environment and assist the government in suppressing usury, the Shanghai Pawnshop Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. According to the resolution of the second member's assembly of the association, it requested the government to provide low-interest loans and discussed the implementation method according to the instructions of the Social Affairs Bureau. The directors and supervisors all believed that there were many members in the industry and the situation was quite complicated, so it could not be accomplished overnight. It was resolved to establish a subcommittee to specifically study concrete plans, which would then be submitted to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors for approval and then submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for assistance.

### Lumber Market Situation

There were no significant price increases in various grades of lumber, but sellers' sentiment was slightly firmer, and the market situation changed from weak to flat.

### Advance on Yan'an

— March 21st, Express News from Xuan Chuan. Our correspondent in Shaanxi, Li Qing

After the Battle of Ma Lan, the strength of both sides on the confrontation line has only increased. This advance on Yan'an is generally regarded as the second act of the former, or the former as the opening prelude to the latter.

On the Communist side, it was reported earlier this month that two to three brigades or more were transferred from western Shanxi across the river, attempting to strengthen the southern line of Yan'an. The famous 358th Brigade and 359th Brigade under He Long are the two brigade numbers that were transferred west to reinforce northern Shaanxi. The deployment of the Communist army, it is said, is to use the Yan'an Defense Regiment, the New Fourth Brigade, the 358th Brigade, and the 359th Brigade as the city defense forces of Yan'an. The Communist forces gathered in the southeast, southwest, and south have also included the Garrison 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Brigades, the New 8th Brigade, the New 9th Brigade, the Teaching 1st Brigade, the Teaching 2nd Brigade, the 27th Division, the 120th Division, and the 6th Cavalry Division. In total, apart from the militia increasing to 100,000, the regular Communist army has reached a maximum of 60,000 to 70,000 troops. This number is at least one-third to one-half more than the week before the war began. In some military strongholds, such as Linzhen Town, Jinpen Bay, and Niuwu Town, the increase is probably one to two times the peacetime level.

From the outbreak of the war to the capture of Yan'an, the focus was on the frontal line of the Yan'an-Luochuan highway and the area east of the highway. The battlefield experienced in the meantime was not as broad as ideal. In short, it was somewhat like an equilateral triangle, with Yan'an as the vertex of the triangle and the connecting line from Luochuan County to Zhujiawan (northwest of Yichuan County) as the base, covering an area of approximately 2,000 square kilometers. However, the area is mostly mountainous, with only sheep gut trails remaining between some highlands, so topographically, it is conducive to the defending side. In terms of terrain, it is also unfavorable to the attacking side, because going north from the Guanzhong Plain to the mountainous area of northern Shaanxi is from low to high, especially north of Yaoxian and Tongchuan. The National Army's risky choice of this difficult area as the main route of march for this advance on Yan'an may have been unforeseen by the CCP leaders. We also remember that certain publications one or two months ago predicted that the route to attack Yan'an would come from the southwest.

The strongholds passed by the National Army before breaking through the pillbox line are roughly as shown in the attached diagram. The first line of important strongholds of the Communist army starts from Fuxian County in the west, passes through Jiaodao Town and Longquan Town in the middle, and reaches Linzhen Town in the west, with a distance of sixty to seventy kilometers in between. Slightly north of this first line are Niuwu Town and Qingquan Town, which are also important strongholds contested by both sides. According to the topography and deployment of the Communist army, the second line of defense of the Communist army seems to be roughly in Ganquan County, north and east of Jinpen Bay, with a distance of less than thirty kilometers. Jinpen Bay is where He Long's headquarters is located. Therefore, it is said that the journey from Xi'an to Yan'an is only from Luochuan to Jinpen Bay.

On the 14th and 15th, the first two days after the war began, the battle situation between the two sides was not very fierce. The first climax was on the third day, the Battle of Jinpen Bay. On the 16th, the National Army recaptured it, and the next day, it captured Ganquan County. At this point, half of the aforementioned equilateral triangle battlefield had been cut off.

The second climax was the Battle of Laushan north of Ganquan. The Communist army used the strategic highlands to concentrate the strength of five brigades (the Independent First Brigade, the Garrison Second Brigade, the Garrison Third Brigade, the New Fourth Brigade, and the New Eighth Brigade), personally commanded by He Long. After several bloody battles, the National Army finally captured several important highlands. Until the afternoon of the 18th, the National Army crossed the mountain ridge, from which it went downhill and directly towards the city of Yan'an.

The advance on Yan'an, which has attracted worldwide attention, had its advance sentries enter at dawn on the 19th, belonging to the First Division under General Luo Lie. (In the Battle of Jinpen Bay, this division made great contributions). Around eight or nine in the morning, the advance troops successively entered. After a small-scale street battle, this Yan'an, known as the "Holy Land of Democracy," no longer saw the red flag with crossed sickle and axe. The battle lasted five days and six nights.

### The Democracy Train has Started (Continued)

— Chen Guyuan

In precedents of the recall system, if a recall motion is rejected, no further recall motion may be made against the same person sought to be recalled during their current term. The reason for this is to avoid acting on whims and misusing the right to recall, and to allow the person sought to be recalled to perform their duties with peace of mind without fear. However, this design unduly restricts the right to recall, and there is no need to adopt it for representatives of the National Assembly. However, in the case of legislators, because they are constantly involved in political affairs and bear the task of legislation, voters in the original electoral district or unit will certainly hope that they will seek special benefits for a locality or a group. If the legislator has some sense of justice and takes into account the interests of the state, they will inevitably be dissatisfied by the voters in the original electoral district or unit. If there are no remedial provisions, it will be difficult to avoid repeated recall motions from voters in those areas. This threat is too severe! Therefore, the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law stipulates that if a recall motion is rejected, no further recall motion may be made against the same legislator during their original term. The Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law also has similar provisions, namely, if a recall motion is rejected, the original petitioner may not make another recall motion against the same Supervisory Committee member during their original term. The President and Vice President Election and Recall Law still follows this example, stipulating that if a recall motion is rejected, the original petitioner may not make another recall motion against the same President and Vice President. This only means that the original petitioner may not make another motion; others may still make a recall motion in accordance with the law.

(6) Establishment and Passage of a Recall Motion

The submission of a recall petition must be signed by a certain number of voters, which is as serious as the signing of a nomination for a candidate. However, too few legally required signatures are not serious enough, and too many are difficult. In the precedents of various countries, the number of signatures required to submit a general recall motion is at most 30% of the voters and at least 5%. When China first implemented the recall system, it goes without saying that the submission of a recall petition must be based on the general practice of requiring a certain percentage of the total number of votes cast when the person was elected in the electoral unit to sign the petition before it can be submitted. However, how is the percentage to be determined so that it is in line with theory and reality? In the recall of representatives to the National Assembly and legislators, the method of "signatures of more than 10% of the voters in the original electoral unit when they were elected" was adopted. For example, when a representative to the National Assembly is elected, even if they are elected with 200,000 votes, if there were 500,000 people who voted in that electoral unit when they were elected, the signatories of the recall petition must be more than 50,000 people. The electoral districts of legislators are larger, and the percentage of people is also relatively large. In the recall of Supervisory Committee members, the method of requiring the joint signatures of more than one-quarter of the total number of voters in each election committee is adopted. For example, if a city council has only sixteen members, at least four councilors must jointly sign to submit a recall petition. In the recall of the President and Vice President, the method of requiring the signatures and seals of more than one-sixth of the total number of representatives of the National Assembly is adopted. If the National Assembly has 2,937 representatives, the recall petition must have at least 489.5 signatures, or to be exact, 490 signatures, before it can be submitted. This type of regulation is nothing more than to make the submission of a recall motion more serious, but the percentage is not necessarily too high, and it is not extremely difficult to submit a recall petition. The submission of a recall petition, in the recall of representatives to the National Assembly or legislators, is submitted to the head of the competent administrative organ of the original electoral unit. The head of the competent administrative organ shall, within thirty days of receiving the petition, verify that the signatures are genuine and that the number of signatories meets the requirements, and shall notify the person sought to be recalled of a copy of the petition, who shall submit a written reply within fifteen days of receipt. Within three days of receiving the written reply, it shall be announced together with the petition, so that voters have a basis for understanding and judging both sides of the recall motion before voting, and then the vote shall be held within thirty days after the announcement. In the recall of Supervisory Committee members, the recall petition is submitted to the speaker of the provincial or municipal council or the head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission or the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The other procedures are the same as the recall of legislators. In the recall of the President and Vice President, the recall petition is sent to the Secretary-General of the National Assembly for announcement. If no one denies the fact of signing within thirty days from the date of announcement, or if there are denials but the number of signatories is still sufficient to meet the one-sixth requirement, the recall motion is established, and the petition is sent to the President of the Legislative Yuan. The President of the Legislative Yuan sends a copy of it to the person sought to be recalled, and convenes a temporary meeting of the National Assembly within one month. After receiving a copy of the petition, the person sought to be recalled submits a written reply to the National Assembly, which is announced by the Secretary-General of the National Assembly. The passage of a recall motion, in the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law, stipulates that the recall motion is passed by a majority of the total number of votes cast when the person was elected, which is extremely fair and reasonable. Because if the calculation is not based on the majority of the total number of votes cast when the person was elected, then if the total number of votes cast in the recall election is extremely small, even if it is calculated by a majority, it is actually a recall motion passed by a very small number of people. Conversely, if we calculate based on the majority of the total number of votes cast when the person was elected, then if the person was elected by a relatively large number of votes, and is recalled by a majority vote, slightly increasing the threshold, it is in line with the principle that recall should be more cautious than election. The provisions of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law do not have the three words "when elected," but there may be supplementary provisions in its implementation regulations. In the Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law, because the Supervisory Committee members are voted on for recall by the councilors of the council, this type of problem does not arise, and only the secret ballot method is used to pass the motion by a majority of the total number of votes cast. In the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law, it is stipulated that the recall motion is passed by a majority of the total number of representatives by secret ballot, which can also be said to be calculated based on the number of votes cast when elected.

After the recall motion is passed, the vacancy of the person recalled is filled by the alternate candidates in the order in the case of National Assembly representatives or legislators. Originally, there are several ways to choose a successor: (1) Hold an election in accordance with the law after the recall motion is passed; this is the fairest and most flawless method, but its disadvantage is that it is cumbersome. (2) The consent to the recall motion and the choice of successor are indicated on the same ballot. All those who support the recall motion simultaneously circle the successor candidate, and if the recall motion is passed, the candidate with the most votes is elected; although this is simpler in procedure, it may not be convenient in China today. (3) The vacancy is filled by appointment; this is a method that violates democracy. (4) The vacancy is left unfilled. This method can be used except in the case of women, when there is no female successor. However, in normal circumstances, if there are too many vacancies and the meeting does not have a quorum, it will constitute a serious situation. (5) The vacancy is filled by alternate candidates in order. Although this method may not avoid the suspicion that alternate candidates deliberately initiate recall motions, in fact, it is not easy to hold by-elections, and the establishment and passage of recall motions are not successful in one fell swoop. Therefore, when China first established the recall system, it had to adopt this method. Conversely, by-elections for Supervisory Committee members are easier, so the successor after the recall of a Supervisory Committee member is not produced by the alternate system, but by election. As for the President being dismissed after being recalled, and the Vice President taking office until the end of the original term of the former President, in another interpretation, it can also be said to be similar to the alternate system.

The above paragraphs are my analysis of the main points of the four election and recall laws.

(7) The New Era of the State

In addition to the President and Vice President Election and Recall Law, the other three election and recall laws have implementation regulations and quota distribution tables for each electoral unit, which are currently under review in the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, there are still many issues regarding elections and recalls, such as election expenses, voting by soldiers and officers, voters and electoral districts, women and electoral districts, false number of signatures, the form of election rights certificates, and all technical issues during implementation, which must be detailed in the implementation regulations. However, the outlines of these four election and recall laws are fully known, allowing the democracy train to start. The election of representatives to the National Assembly, legislators, and Supervisory Committee members will be completed before September of this year, and the election of the President and Vice President will be completed after the National Assembly convenes on December 25, all in accordance with the respective election and recall laws. Talking about democracy on paper is writing on paper. Talking about democracy with one's mouth is a castle in the air. It can also be said that they are blueprints or locomotives that have not left the factory. Having these various election and recall laws promulgated and implemented is tantamount to taking a train out of the factory, placing it on the tracks, lighting the fire, and starting it. This is democracy that is put into practice.

Due to the promulgation of the ten laws related to the Constitution, especially the various election and recall laws, I deeply feel that China is moving in a new direction towards democracy, which is one of the great changes in China's thousands of years of history. Before the Spring and Autumn Period, class distinctions were obvious in the feudal politics of China. The son of a scholar was always a scholar, and the son of a farmer was always a farmer. This was a situation in which noble families held power, and common people could not rise. The situation changed in the Warring States period, when itinerant scholars persuaded various countries, and in the morning they were commoners, and in the evening they were ministers of state. The two Han Dynasties used local recommendations to select scholars, and the Six Dynasties used family status to interfere in politics. The situation was different in each period. The Sui and Tang dynasties emphasized examinations, and scholars were initially unaccustomed to it, and even felt ashamed to submit petitions to recommend themselves. However, as time went on, poor but studious scholars could eventually stand out and discuss state affairs. From the end of the Qing Dynasty to the 30th year of the Republic of China, the practice of recommendation flourished, and the situation was different from before. After the promulgation of the Constitution, the people can now be involved in public affairs, and the way to do so depends entirely on elections, and recalls are used to remedy its shortcomings. This is a brand new system, and it depends on how we adapt to it, how we act in accordance with the various election and recall laws, and thereby exert the power of this democracy train. Advance! Advance! The new era is beginning, the new China is emerging, advance on the road to democracy!

### How to Deal with the Flood of Counterfeit Currency

Recently, trains and ships have refused to use the 2-Yuan legal tender notes of 1945, which has led to shops in various places also refusing to use them. The reason for this is probably that too many counterfeit versions of this edition have been produced, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake. If no measures are taken to remedy this, allowing the common people to suffer this innocent loss and affecting the credibility of the legal tender is no small matter. I am writing this letter to appeal, hoping that the authorities will have good methods to deal with this, so that the national economy and the people's livelihood will both benefit. (Wen Mu)

### A Brief Sketch of a Figure in Yan'an: "Labor Hero" Zhang Yongtai

Zhang Yongtai, the "Labor Hero" of Yan'an, was a former Qing Dynasty scholar, now 68 years old. Since the Communist army settled in Yan'an twelve years ago, all his property, including more than 300 mu of land, more than 600 sheep, more than 60 heads of cattle, three donkeys, one horse, and more than 300 dan of food, were confiscated as "public" property through "struggle". Only more than 30 mu of land were left as Zhang Yongtai's property. Later, under the pressure of coercion, Zhang Yongtai continued to cultivate, and Mao Zedong especially praised him as a "Labor Hero." Zhang Yongtai's grandson, Zhang Dazhong, was coerced by the Communist Party and joined the Party. Taking the opportunity of the National Army's recovery of Yan'an, the grandfather and grandson have surrendered to the National Army authorities. They answered the inquirer's questions in great detail, and their words were filled with grief and indignation!

### A Brief Discussion on Reading Methods

— Yang Tongfang

The purpose of reading is to seek knowledge, and its ultimate goal is practice. The process of reading should be a dynamic, developing, and practical process of life. That is to say, reading must be for application. Initially, we must learn something from books. Every book is organized. We cannot only understand the details and the meanings of sentences and words, but also grasp a system of thought. The theories presented in books all have a system. Understanding the form without focusing on the substance cannot be considered true understanding. Every book also has a center. Some pages of theoretical expositions can be said to be embellishments, not all of them are the backbone. In addition, it is necessary to understand the narrative method of a book, and see how it is structured and organized. This seems to belong to form, but in fact it is closely related to theory. It has a consistent connection with grasping the system of thought, grasping logic, and grasping the center.

After learning a little concept and knowledge, we must further use our minds. We cannot always accept other people's ideas, but should establish our own ideas. At this time, we must maintain a skeptical attitude. With doubt, we can generate the function of thinking and judgment. Doubt and criticism must pay attention to the facts, and compare what is said in the book with what you have seen, heard, and experienced. Criticism must have a standpoint. Ignoring the essential, individual, and scientific facts, that thought will not be able to stand.

In order to unify and deepen and broaden the acquired knowledge and one's own thinking, it is best to write notes and summaries while reading and thinking. These skills are of great help to scholarship. After reading a book, you may wish to write a book review. If there is nothing to review, it is also okay to extract the main points of the content succinctly. Reading must have insights. At least you have to grasp some important ideas. You cannot have no impression at all and let the concepts and thoughts pass before your eyes. Therefore, reading must have a serious attitude, and you must never be perfunctory and think it's over after one look. Liang Qichao said: "Reading is like attacking a city and seizing land, you must concentrate all your energy on it." I think that the fun and insights of reading can only be obtained and experienced by those who read seriously and conscientiously.

After reading, we should talk about the issue of application. Great Confucian scholars in our country have always advocated the saying that "learning is for application," but few people can understand the true meaning of this. Literally, application may have two interpretations: one is that learning (Chinese people have always regarded doing scholarship as the same thing as reading) is used to help the world and is necessary to solve practical problems; the other is that seeking knowledge is for adapting to the world, and the means of making a living lies in this. Of course, the first interpretation is more correct. However, in today's world, we should not completely regard continued learning as a "preparation" effort, but should make reading related to the entire "life". Reading can expand horizons, fill ideas, transform life experiences, and enhance the meaning of life. Chinese people really do not pay enough attention to the cultivation of reading habits. Except for students, there is no widespread reading atmosphere in society. This is influenced by traditional education. Most people regard reading and application as two separate things. Application begins after preparation is complete (such as students reading in school). There is no need to prepare when applying, so there is no need to read. You only care about preparation when preparing, and you don't have to think about application when reading. In fact, this is a huge misunderstanding. We should consider application when reading. The process of reading should be regarded as the process of the whole life. The application referred to here is not only that you can use the information in the book as a quotation after reading it, but the most important thing is to use it to cope with the dynamic environment of life and solve difficult problems in real life.

In short, the meaning of reading is to apply knowledge to practice, and the reading methods we should adopt must implement this ideal and read books in a dynamic and developing way.

### Review of "The Story of an English Learner in Difficulties"

— Ren Wen

Written by Fang Dawen, Published by Mingshan Bookstore

At least for the moment, English has become a world language. According to scholars' statistics, the number of people who directly use English in the world is as high as 400 million, and the number of people who are indirectly related to it is even unknown. In terms of language itself, whether English can be improved and become a world language in the future is naturally a matter of much debate and not within our discussion. Today, all levels of schools in the country use English as the first foreign language. The amount of time that every university graduate spends learning English during their studies is staggering, but the number of these people who can really use this language is indeed limited. Therefore, this matter has become a serious problem in education. Is it that the language itself is difficult? Is the teaching method inappropriate? Is the choice of teaching materials inappropriate? Is the learning environment unsuitable? It can be said that these are all reasons. Because of this, those engaged in language education are constantly racking their brains to find ways to remedy it, and the greatest gains in this regard have been the continuous adaptation of teaching materials and the publication of supplementary reading materials. Today, no matter which bookstore we go to, we can see many English reading materials. As far as the author knows, these reading materials have a common shortcoming, that is, they have not escaped from the way of rote knowledge and lack the function of enlightenment. This shortcoming has now been made up for by "The Story of an English Learner in Difficulties."

According to the author's preface, this book is divided into three volumes: elementary, middle, and high school levels. It describes the process of several students learning English in the style of a story. In terms of the story, it takes the process of Lin Yiyi, a student who originally had no interest in English, being influenced by the environment and becoming extremely fond of English, as the warp, and the mutual guidance and research of his classmates and teachers as the weft; in terms of English knowledge, it takes the logical development of grammar as the warp, from shallow to deep, from simple to detailed, and circular and repetitive, like a bamboo shoot, and intersperses it with situational conversations, reading materials, compositions, article analysis, and various methods of learning English, so that people feel like they are reading a novel when reading, without feeling boring.

For teaching reference, I spent a whole afternoon and evening reading fourteen chapters of this book and found that several chapters are particularly worth recommending. For example, Chapter 2, "Stimulated by a Female Classmate," Chapter 5, "The Wall Full of English Words," and Chapter 6, "Little Wind and Sand," all make the most of realistic themes. The richness of its interest makes people unable to put it down until they have finished reading this chapter. The last two chapters synthesize the knowledge of the previous chapters and open a path for beginners of English to continue their studies. Generally speaking, this is a very good English reader; the first characteristic is that it starts from the learner's point of view, not from the teacher's point of view; the second characteristic is that it adopts realistic themes and provides enlightenment at random; the third characteristic is that it guides various learning methods from the story, pays attention to developing habits, and does not have a doctrinaire tone, which makes people feel close after reading it. Speaking of its shortcomings, it is naturally not without them. For example, the materials quoted in the book are Nash's grammar in terms of grammar (although the author particularly emphasizes citing example sentences, which Nash's grammar cannot match), and Fifty Western Anecdotes and Aesop's Fables in terms of reading materials, while articles in recent newspapers and magazines are rarely quoted; in terms of learning, in addition to mentioning a Webster's phonetic symbols and international phonetic symbols, it fails to fully elaborate on pronunciation precautions that can be expressed in words and correction of common mistakes for beginners of English; the ninth child lists as many as 140 correction sentences for nouns and pronouns, and fails to find a way to distribute them in various places, making it seem a bit dull and lengthy to read. In addition, some places seem to have no connection between the story itself and English knowledge, which is also a shortcoming. Even so, for those who are new to English, or those who find it difficult to learn English and lack interest in it, this is a very beneficial book that is worth reading and rereading. If the author thinks that the above criticisms are worth referring to, I hope that he can pay more attention to them when reviewing the middle and lower volumes, and at the same time, I hope that they can be published soon.

### Introducing an Excellent Chemical Reference Book

— Shen Juecheng

Title: Dictionary of Chemical Drugs Editor: Gao Xian Publisher: Xin Ya Bookstore

Dictionaries are tools for learning. Those who read English cannot do without an English dictionary; those who study chemistry naturally need a chemistry dictionary. However, looking at the publishing world, apart from linguistics, only the Commercial Press published several types of dictionaries of animals and plants in the early years of the Republic of China. Regarding chemistry, there is silence. Even if you search for a makeshift, you can only find a few small booklets and compilations, which can only be called vocabulary. The reason for this is, as the editor himself stated: "The creation of a dictionary is not an easy task." Chemistry dictionaries are especially complex. Chemistry deals with the study of matter; where does matter exist? If it does not belong to animals and plants, it must enter minerals. Therefore, speaking of chemistry must involve animals, plants, and minerals; in other words, it must involve the study of natural history. There is no doubt that chemistry dictionaries must involve animals, plants, and minerals. Just speaking of chemistry, there are thousands of things, which are already diverse and varied, and naming them is not easy. Adding natural history terms is like adding flowers to embroidery.

Under these circumstances, there is still a chemistry dictionary that is difficult to appear, but today one has been published. However, this is a dictionary of chemical drugs related to chemistry, not a chemistry dictionary. Therefore, many terms, methods, and historical figures related to chemistry are not mentioned. Although it is suspected of being biased, in China's barren cultural world, it can already be called an extremely good tool for chemistry.

Calling it extremely good is not to praise the editor or to promote the bookstore. It is only because the publishing world today is subject to various fetters and difficulties, and is already on its last breath. What we see are just some small books. This kind of giant work is almost impossible to publish. Even if there are one or two, they are not this kind of rigid scientific book. It is worthy of praise that Xin Ya Bookstore was able to publish it resolutely at this time. The publishing world is lonely, and writers are naturally depressed; at this time, no one will make such an attempt. We can see the date recorded on the preface to see the editor's starting date, which is almost ten years ago, and the so-called date of going to press is also four years ago, so it is naturally inevitable that it is not perfect. Many of the names used are based on the existing ones, and it seems inevitable that they will be inherited. However, the editor said in his preface: "A name is the guest of reality. The only worry is that it is uncertain and has no system. The debate about good and bad is secondary." Therefore, the names of animals, plants, and minerals; chemical and medical names are all inherited from the existing ones, nothing more than to make them commonly used. This book is based on the English version. All places that are not reached by the original book have been corrected. Now I will list its advantages here.

(1) The search is extensive. As long as we count the number of pages and the number of lines in the English index attached at the end, we can know that about 10,000 terms are listed. Those with different names for the same thing should have been detailed. In addition to what was originally listed in the book, the work of supplementing and compiling it seems not easy, but it is also valuable.

(2) The content is substantial. In addition to the above-mentioned English terms, the editor has also widely searched and listed Chinese names. And the molecular formula, molecular weight, or atomic number, atomic weight, and atomic valence are added. In theory, these are all important items. In addition to the properties and constants, there are two items for the method of manufacture: origin and refining. In addition to the use, there are also grades and packaging to clarify the actual situation of the product, which is naturally practical for the project. There is also a special article on fires and explosions. These are essential knowledge for storage and transportation, and are very important in practical use. There is also a point that can be mentioned, that is, various constant tables are attached at the end, which are indispensable for practical use. After the editor's supplement, it is even more complete.

(3) The naming is uniform. The editor adopts an attitude of describing but not creating for many terms, so each term has a basis. Many common names and other names are not abandoned, and are listed below, and special articles are established for each to allow for easy checking.

(4) The arrangement is clear. The main name is listed first according to the stroke count. If there are other names or common names, they are added in parentheses and listed after them. The English name is then attached in parentheses, and if there is more than one name, they are separated by ";". The explanatory text is divided into multiple items, the first is the chemical formula, and the second is the properties, constants... uses, etc. are all distinguished by heavy square brackets, so the outline is extremely clear.

Based on these points, I said earlier that it is an extremely good tool for harm. The editor hopes that the aftercomers will make it even better in his preface. Then the editor certainly does not think that it is extremely good, and hopes that this so-called extremely good can pass with the times and be replaced by the so-called extremely good in the future. Then, for the sake of the culture and academics of the motherland, I hope that the trend will continue, and not be like the dictionaries of botany and zoology, which have not changed a word for decades, and that no second type will appear for decades, becoming the only treasure in chemistry in our country.

Now I will introduce the author. The author, Gao Xianjun, is engaged in chemical engineering. His achievements are as described in Zhang's preface. In his spare time, he also engages in writing. His works were mostly published by the Commercial Press in the past, so he is not an unfamiliar figure in the engineering world and the writing world. Then this book is also not an unfamiliar text for the reader.

### "History and Geography of the Soviet Union"

— Xin Jun

One of the Rejuvenation Series • Written by Wu Qingyou • Published by the Commercial Press

Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, in his book "Mission to Moscow," expressed the following sentiments about the Soviet Union: "The Soviet Union is a large country, occupying one-sixth of the world's land area and home to approximately one-tenth of the world's population. God has blessed them with abundant natural resources – minerals, agriculture, fisheries, and forests – and a great, capable, and strong people. The Soviet Union's potential matches its demonstrated achievements, and it is destined to become one of the world's greatest powers."

The current world is divided into two types: capitalism, represented by countries like the United States and Britain, and socialism, represented by the Soviet Union.

Many young people are already quite clear about the formation of capitalist countries like Britain and the United States, but few are aware of the formation of the socialist state of the Soviet Union. However, given current trends, understanding the Soviet Union is essential.

Previously, this publication introduced several books on studying the Soviet Union, but because these were research-oriented, they were not suitable for young readers, as young people must first have an understanding before embarking on research. The book "History and Geography of the Soviet Union" that I am now introducing can be said to be the only book for understanding the Soviet Union.

Within this book, young people are told about the historical development of the Soviet Union, the reasons for the creation of its socialist state, and a clear explanation of all aspects of the Soviet Union is provided. Every piece of writing is worth reading.

The contents of this book are as follows:

It first explains the Soviet Union's topography and boundaries, mountains and rivers, and its climate and products. Next, it discusses the Soviet Union's ethnicities and population, geographical conditions, and the distribution of Soviet production. The above covers the geographical aspects of the Soviet Union, and the descriptions are very detailed.

Then, it discusses: Russia in ancient and medieval times, the rise and fall of the Russian Empire, the October Revolution and the birth of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union during the Five-Year Plan period. Finally, it discusses the Soviet Union during wartime. This historical section is even more detailed and accurate than the geographical section.

In addition to this, this book also discusses the Soviet Union's economy, culture, and future trends.

This book can be said to be an overview of the Soviet Union. Although some parts are still brief, it is very suitable for general readers to read. After reading it, you will definitely have a considerable understanding of the Soviet Union, and then you can further research the Soviet Union.

After reading this book, if you want to have a deeper understanding of the Soviet Union, we can also look at the following books: (1) "The Soviet Union Today" – written by Wu Qingyou, Reading Edition, (2) "Mission to Moscow" – written by Davies, also available in translation, (3) "Return from the Soviet Union" – written by Shao Lizi, published by the China Cultural Service Society. After reading all these books, I can confidently say that you will have a very deep understanding of the Soviet Union. As for books on researching the Soviet Union, there are truly too many to list here.

In short, understanding the Soviet Union is essential for young people today, and "History and Geography of the Soviet Union" is the basic text for understanding the Soviet Union. Reading it can increase our knowledge – understanding the Soviet Union.

### News from the Publishing World

It is now known that the bookstore has already released a second edition to thank readers who love this book.

### Arc de Triomphe

— Written by Remarque • Translated by Zhu Baoguang • Published by the Zhongwai Publishing House

Previously, the literary supplement of the Zhengyan Daily had published a lengthy serialization of Remarque's novel "Arc de Triomphe," translated by Mr. Zhu Wen, which attracted the attention of general readers at the time. Unfortunately, for some reason, it was suddenly discontinued halfway through and not completed. Recently, in a bookstore, I happened to find a Chinese translation of "Arc de Triomphe," signed by the translator Zhu Baoguang. The writing style is also quite elegant, but unfortunately, it is only translated from an abridged version of the original book, and we have not yet been able to see the whole picture.

"Arc de Triomphe" is a work completed in 1945 by Remarque (Erich Maria Remarque), a famous anti-war and anti-Nazi writer. After the publication of this novel, it caused a sensation in the reading world and became one of the best-selling books in the United States last spring.

The story is as follows:

Ravic, a German surgeon, was expelled by the Nazi Party after 1938 and wandered to Paris. He lives in an old small hotel, in front of which is a square. At night, there are scattered lights. In the foggy rainy season, the tomb of the Unknown Soldier lying under the memorial stone tower often appears even more gloomy and melancholy, and the magnificent Arc de Triomphe is not far from here.

Ravic has no passport in Paris. In order to pay for room and board, he has to work as an assistant for a French doctor with less-than-stellar skills. The life of a refugee is dim and lonely. When he is bored, he can only stay in the underground dining hall of the hotel to smoke or chat with some wanderers. A Russian man named "Morosow" is Ravic's good friend; he is a doorman at a nightclub.

One night, on his way home, Ravic encountered a woman near the Arc de Triomphe. She seemed to have suffered a major shock, was not very clear-headed, and was extremely tired, swaying as if about to fall. He quickly helped her and took her to a small tavern to rest, and they drank some wine together. Afterwards, he placed this homeless woman in the hotel—Ravic did this entirely out of pity, without any ulterior motives. This young woman is called Madou Roang, an Italian singer wandering here, lonely and nameless, but she has a strangely beautiful head of hair and elegant manners. She wears a finely tailored blue dress.

Later, through Ravic's introduction, Roang sings in the nightclub guarded by Morosow. There is a Gypsy band, the lights are very soft, and Ravic often spends a lot of time here. He begins to find that Roang has a mysterious face, full of confusion and charm, which he had never seen before. Once, late at night after the nightclub closed, they drank Calvados again—the same drink they had in the small tavern when they first met. When Roang's hand was placed on Ravic's body, warmth passed through his clothes and reached his heart. He felt intimacy, and his heart gradually changed from emptiness to fullness. They fell in love with each other.

Soon, Ravic and Roang spent eight quiet and comfortable days in the beautiful Riviera, the cost of which was Ravic's newly received consultation fee. They were so happy in this new place. Under the moonlight, their dark figures were shattered by each other's footsteps, they drank delicious sparkling wine, and spoke countless incomprehensible words. The joy of those eight days exceeded what they had experienced in the previous eight years, but it was as short as eight minutes. In the blink of an eye, everything was over.

Ravic returned to Paris and encountered an unexpected misfortune. He was arrested by the police and, because he was found without a passport, he was banished to the Swiss border, spending three months there. When he was released and returned, Roang had already moved in with another man. He felt angry and bitter, although Roang still expressed her love for him and wanted to return to his side, he completely refused. At this moment, Ravic met the terrible Nazi agent—Hake—in the hotel. Hake came from Berlin. He was treacherous and fierce, and had killed countless people. Ravic's former lover was poisoned to death by him. This time, he was unwilling to let go of this opportunity easily. He used great wisdom and courage to murder Hake and bury his body in the bushes of the wilderness, without leaving a trace. Only then did Ravic feel the pleasure and relief of revenge.

Finally, Roang was also shot. It was too late for Ravic to treat her; he could not save her. The woman he had cared for and loved finally lay in his arms, tightly closing her lips. The last sound from those lips would forever ripple in Ravic's ears; she had said to him: "I love you"!

On this very night, the German army began to invade Poland. France was immersed in an atmosphere of panic and tension. Ravic took his suitcase and a blanket, followed the police, and jumped into a truck. The truck drove through the Arc de Triomphe. The square was completely dark. They couldn't even see the huge, gray shadow stretching into the clouds—the Arc de Triomphe.

"Arc de Triomphe" is a great novel that expresses human love and hate. The author lets us see a true picture in his creation. We cannot forget how the refugee under Nazi violence struggled towards a difficult situation with eager desire. Ravic is a "heart." He needs the rights of a free man. He needs the nourishment of warmth. He loves and is loved. He is also despised. He also retaliates against those who despise him. He finally killed Hake, one of the many enemies. He has endured these bitter and cold days. What exactly does he rely on? What kind of strange power is supporting him? Remarque tells us here: because Ravic always tightly embraces one thing—that is, his faith.

With amazing writing skills and delicate psychological descriptions, the success of this novel is undeniable. In addition to Remarque's great contribution in consciousness, his writing is also very fascinating. The dialogue and narration contain many epigrams, beautiful and profound, often causing people to think deeply after reading, and then read again. For example, when Roang returns to Ravic, he refuses her and says: "Roang, don't be with me. A person cannot lock up the wind, nor can he lock up the water. If he locks them up, the wind and water will decay. The wind that is confined will become corrupt air. You have come and cannot stay in any place for long." He also said: "Doctors are like women, we monitor death, you monitor love. All the reasons in the world are in this matter."

Remarque is a German who participated in the First World War, was wounded five times. After the war, he worked as a teacher, stonemason, motor vehicle inspector for a car company, and assistant editor for a certain pictorial. In 1929, he wrote a world-shattering novel "All Quiet on the Western Front," which was initially rejected by one publisher, but later reluctantly accepted by another. In the first year of its publication, it sold 1.2 million copies in Germany alone and was translated into 29 languages. Since the Nazi Party came to power in Germany, his books have been banned, and his German citizenship has been revoked. In 1939, he came to the United States and has now applied for U.S. citizenship.

In addition to "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Arc de Triomphe," Remarque's works also include "The Road Back," "Three Comrades," and "Flotsam."

(Editor's Note: Recently, we received a letter from Mr. Zhu Wen, informing us that the translation of this book, which he previously published in installments in the Zhengyan Daily, has now been completed and is being typeset by the Cultural Life Publishing House, scheduled for publication at the end of May. According to this, it can be known that there are already two Chinese translations of this book.)

### "Life is Meaningless"?

— Tang Shan

A young man in Beiping, feeling that life was meaningless, committed suicide at the Beijing Hotel on the first of this month. Before his death, he played the song "The Wind of May." (See the Beiping telegram in this newspaper on the 4th) This kind of death belongs to another side, that is, it does not belong to the general suicides caused by economic oppression or unrequited love and unemployment.

For a person to explore the problem of life, especially to pursue it to the problems that belong to the category of philosophy of life, it can really be said to be asking for trouble. Life is life, just as a dog is a dog, and a tree is a tree. If we were to ask why we were born to be human, and why being human means eating, defecating, walking, and sleeping like this, then for this major question, we really have an endless number of answers. Moreover, it's better not to ask or answer. Once we ask and answer, the problem becomes more and more complicated, and the more we say, the more confused we become. In the end, we become inexplicable.

I say this not to tell people to live like zombies, muddling through one day at a time. It is unnecessary for a person to think too far ahead and try to understand the mysteries of life, but it is also wrong to live in a daze. A more moderate view of life in between is to give oneself a place in life. I am studying now, so I must understand my lessons clearly; I am working, so I should complete this work thoroughly; as a clerk, I must fulfill my responsibilities meticulously. In short, today's life is about completing the work that I should do today. As for what benefits this work has for society and life, why am I doing this, and what does it mean to do it... it is best not to think about such thoughts that are far from reality. "Only hear the plowing, not the harvest," this is not to say that we ignore the purpose, but that the purpose is actually in the plowing itself.

Many people are too calculating about utilitarianism. Whenever they feel that their work will not help the future, they are unwilling to spend time now. In this way, they often leave their time empty. It doesn't matter if it's empty, but because of the emptiness, many irrelevant associations arise. So they feel that there is nothing to do, and what they can do has no meaning. I believe that this young man who committed suicide must have had too much free time, allowing him to imagine a mysterious problem of life in this free time. Unfortunately, he was ultimately swallowed up by this vast problem and it devoured his real life. Otherwise, if he were as busy as a farmer who goes out early and returns late or a rickshaw driver who runs all day long, how could he have time to think about this pitiful problem? Naturally, he would not commit suicide. Life is inherently without incident; fools disturb themselves! Those who do not grasp reality and only circle around those unrealistic problems, you say they are clever for a lifetime, but in fact, they are confused for a lifetime!

However, having said that, if reality could satisfy people more, then young people might not think about those unattainable problems at all!

### Normal School Movement Week: The Drums Are Not Loud

— Ziming

Today, talking about "the Way of the Teacher" is generally considered pedantic and a step backward. Fashionable people will not listen. However, everyone clearly understands that the next generation of the nation inherits this generation of the nation, and their hopes for them are very sincere and infinite. However, how to educate them and cultivate them into knowledgeable and capable mainstays so that they can shoulder the important task of inheriting the previous generation of the nation, then, those who bear the responsibility of education are extremely important! The government has emphasized this point, launched the "Normal School Education" Movement Week, aroused the people of the country to advocate normal school education, improve the status of teachers, and encourage normal school students, making educators, who have always had bitter faces, reveal a moment of a smile. – Just a moment of a smile!

Every movement, at the beginning, only makes opening drums, and rarely has a successful ending. Other movements are like this, how can this "Normal School" movement escape this category? Moreover, during this movement, the drums are not loud, so it is easily forgotten. Those adults, bald heads, will not be interested; university professors are clamoring for subsidies; the lives of primary and secondary school teachers, especially, are arduous and struggling; those normal school students, not caring about the ridicule of their classmates, bury their heads in their studies. Because, the future of those who study normal school has long been destined. It seems that studying general subjects has a future, and they can go to higher schools for further studies, so they are proud and despise those who study normal school. Normal school students hold the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?", the belief of "Education Saves the Nation", which is really admirable; unfortunately, graduation means unemployment, although there are many who have the ambition to dedicate themselves to education, this wish is often not realized. Given an opportunity, they all changed their professions. Otherwise, they can only be frustrated and despondent all day long. Who else pays attention to them? The past sorrow of normal school students is like this, what dare the future ask for?

### Random Chat

— Wang Cong

"Adding flowers to embroidery" is not as good as "sending charcoal in the snow," because adding flowers to embroidery is not very necessary. But how much warmth is needed in the cold!

I especially love the lonely feeling of upwardness, so I like to approach the old nobles who have fallen into the rivers and lakes and the powdered skulls of the red powder legends.

Because the friendship in the wind and dust will be more lovely than the innocent innocence.

The middle age in the wind and dust is the second nine years of life in the crucial point. Women are like peaches and plums, valued in color; women in the wind and dust are like plum blossoms, valued in breath.

Emotions that have been through the sea are not easy to move. If they move, they cannot be suppressed.

Compared to the ladies who are "everyone's wife," the women in the wind and dust are worthy of respect.

Someone said: "Time and space are a function of emotion." Obviously, I don't like this sentence very much. I don't believe that all old friends are good friends.

Wang Bo said: "A bosom friend afar brings a distant land near." This experience is worth cherishing.

The Buddhist said, meeting is complete, emphasizing the word "complete". Therefore, people's acquaintance does not necessarily require an interview. Wang Shixian visited Dai Andao, and returned without entering his door. He explained to himself: "I went for fun and returned with satisfaction; why bother to see Dai?" Yuan Zhong's spirit of expressing himself as much as possible in front of a good friend is much better than the general Jin people's hypocritical talks.

Didn't Dante instantly confirm the love he was forever attached to when he was nine years old? Wasn't this entanglement sublimated into the brilliant classic of poetry—"The Divine Comedy"? Who dares to deny that this is the most beautiful emotion?

### On the Obstinacy of Gangyi

— Mu Tao

Gangyi was one of the culprits of the Gengzi Incident, and also the worst example of adulating and welcoming the imperial edict. He came from a translator's degree (this specifically refers to translating Manchu text, there was such a subject in the Qing Dynasty, not translating the languages of various countries). Although he was not completely ignorant, his absurdity in writing and his confusion in views were rare even among the Manchu officials. However, he was appointed as the governor and entered the Grand Council. The Eastern Dynasty used this kind of person, it is really what is called Zheng Wu as the prime minister, the current affairs can be known.

After the Jiawu-Yihai War of Guangxu and before the Gengzi Incident, the Western Palace became increasingly water and fire, and those attached to Cixi and those attached to Emperor Dezong each established a party, and Gang was the mainstay of the Cixi party. Therefore, he always said to people: Our emperor must learn from Emperor Shun, satirizing Guangxu's unfilial piety to cater to Cixi. When he was the Minister of the Ministry of Punishment, on the day of his appointment, he gathered the officials and said: We, as officials of the Ministry of Punishment, must learn from Gao Tao (that is, continue like the original character said Tao). The position of the Xingcao's position (the position of Xingcao is Manchu for what he is responsible for) is not held by Han Chinese unless they have two rankings, or they must have a formal background. Hearing this, they all couldn't help but cover their mouths and smile. When he was the Governor of Jiangsu, he styled himself as Shi Shilun (Shi Gong in the old drama), and used Long Dianyang as Huang Tianba, even expressing it in his memorials. Therefore, Weng Songchan made a quatrain: "The emperor descends to the king in great surprise, Gao Yao covers his ears and fears hearing his name. Now there is Huang Tianba again, who is the Sai Erdun of the year." Gang knew this and hated Weng to the bone. Weng was Emperor Dezong's teacher and naturally belonged to the Dezong party. Gang, in front of Cixi, reported his shortcomings (Gang made friends with Li Lianying very closely), which led to the dismissal of the Wuxu coup, and even handed him over to the local officials for strict control, and used his donated patriotism of 50,000 gold to enter the embezzlement library, how could he not humiliate him with all kinds of embarrassment? In fact, Gang was a translator's degree, and Weng was actually the examiner, and they had a teacher-student friendship, but he bit back like this, his person is really a scoundrel. The late father entered the Grand Council in Yihai and was in the same rank with him for four years, and told us: When Gang read Jin Wu Liu Ding's memorial, he always read Ding as "cai", and Weng told him: This character is not pronounced as "cai", Gang retorted Weng: Why is the Ding character in Sun Jian's name pronounced as "nai"? His obstinacy and incomprehension were like this. No wonder he flattered Cixi, trusted the Boxers, brought disaster to the country, and died with a broken reputation without repentance.

### Remembering Old Events

— Zhou Tingwu

The late Qing Sheng (Gongbao) Xuanhuai Shi, when he traveled east to inspect factories and mines, met with Ito Hirobumi. He eagerly said: The two countries of China and Japan should carefully maintain friendship and never allow external insults to take advantage of internal friction. If there is any change, Japan, fearing the cold of lips and teeth, can hardly stand by and watch? Your Excellency has been an old friend for twenty years, so I do not hesitate to confide my true feelings, and I have eight words to offer: "Take care of the overall situation and do not dispute small things." This should be pleasing to your Excellency. I don't know that those who took office later were arrogant and domineering, treating China as a forbidden area, and eventually ran into a wall. According to their generation's reversal of words, it is appropriate to have this retribution.

New Knowledge

### Sound Movie Mobile House

— Jun Xuan

Recently, I visited a sound projector that was shipped to China for the first time, and I feel that it can be used as a tool to promote electrified education, so I would like to introduce it:

The body is quite large, quite like a square cabin, with four wheels underneath, which is very easy to push. The inside of the machine is pitch black, and the sound projector film, amplifier, and all the mechanical parts are installed in it. The screen is a square beryllium glass, installed on the upper section of the front of the machine. From the outside, it looks like a radio receiver for wireless image transmission.

After turning on the power, the indicator light emits a red light, and then pressing the start button, the movie will move on the glass screen. The picture of the film is reflected from the outside of the machine, and at the same time, the amplifier also plays the recordings on the soundtrack.

Its newest feature is that it can automatically, continuously, repeatedly, and cyclically play each 400-foot film, four films, or a 1,600-foot film. In addition, once it is installed and started, it will take care of itself. Even if there is any obstacle in the machine—such as the film being interrupted, too tight, or too wide—it will automatically stop and cut off the power.

The installation procedure is very simple: (1) Wind the film to be circulated into a specially made disc; (2) A total of six or eight feet of film is drawn from the inner and outer rings of this disk; (3) Glue the drawn film, that is, the beginning and end of the film, together; (4) After a few "rollers" and lenses, the inner film is exactly connected to the outer periphery of the film. The reason why it can be played continuously and repeatedly is due to the clever mechanical design of the glued film start and end.

Educational textbook films are mostly 400 feet per film. By gluing four films (that is, four topics) together, they can be played for 40 minutes. If it is played for four hours every night, it can automatically circulate six times. If each audience is 100 people, then 600 people can be taught every night, and 20,000 people will gain academic knowledge due to the movie every month. From the perspective of popularizing mass education, it is indeed a noteworthy tool.

### Money · Wealth

— A Lin

Before his death, Chichikov's father left his son not a fortune, but a saying that he would benefit from for the rest of his life: "The most trustworthy thing is money."

Standing in front of life, money is indeed the best [unclear text]. It can make a person jump from a thirteenth-rank civil official to a first or second-rank civil official. It can also make Yan Huagui's group favor you regardless of your background. In the countryside, there is a market in the middle of the day where goods can be exchanged. In the city, if you don't have it, you will feel that the world is so big that there is no place for you. Money is a [unclear text] beam between you and life.

Therefore, the more fully one lives, the more one loves the importance of money. Therefore, the more one is involved with money, the more one finds it lovable. This is why there are tigers in Jinhu, and why senior officials in the Central Bank use their positions to purchase gold.

A poet once described money as an immoral bacterium. In fact, it is better to compare it to yeast, which ferments a person's desires without end. The origin of wealth is worth studying. Originally, human beings either worked or competed. As time has passed to this day, it is still the same. The competition for more or less in the exchange is an example. The speculation of gold and all goods is not actually a plunder of the common people? Honest labor will not increase wealth a thousandfold in five minutes. To get rich, one must be violent. Only improper behavior is allowed here. Therefore, today, a legitimate businessman often does not operate, not because he does not want to operate, but because he feels that such operation is unreasonable and unbearable.

One wave of gold rush made many people thin and hungry, but how many people actually became rich in this opportunity? Although it is said that there will be investigations and handling, such as the Central Bank's gold discount officials, it is only a matter of dismissal. The money that comes [unclear text] is still in their own pockets. Locking the stable door after the horse is stolen is already too late.

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

"Is there a solution? Aili, let me tell you, when the country is in trouble and there is no solution, no matter how resourceful an individual is, there will be no solution!" Suddenly he realized that these words were like playing the lute to a cow when speaking to Jin Aili, so he immediately changed his tone. "In short, Aili, don't compare me to Xu the Fat or the Zhus! They are gods and generals, I am a little ghost! What solution do you think I have?"

Jin Aili chuckled.

"What are you laughing at?" Old Zhu said solemnly, "Even you are much better than me now! You are a fairy! Aren't you leaving tomorrow?"

"Then, do you want me to help them?" Old Zhu's words, when Jin Aili heard them, were 100% flattery, which made her even happier.

Old Zhu hesitated for a moment. He knew that at least in these few days, Jin Aili was a treasure of the Zhus. If she said a few words, it might be effective. However, he knew Lan's personality too well. She would not easily ask for help from him, how would she be willing to see Jin Aili and the Zhu's assistant's faces?

"Okay! But I have to ask them myself!" He wiped his lips with his hand, "If [unclear text] really can't get on the train, I will definitely come and hit you. I know where the Zhu's live."

Jin Aili looked at him meaningfully.

"However you want me to [unclear text], I will do so [unclear text]." She said gently.

"Okay, thank you, Aili." Old Zhu also seemed very happy. He stood up and paid the bill first, not giving Aili a chance to fight him.

When he was about to go out, she enthusiastically grabbed Old Zhu's hand again and asked diligently:

"When are you planning to leave yourself?"

Old Zhu knew her heart very well, and at the same time, he was very clear about the goodwill she had for him.

"You go first!" Old Zhu said as if comforting a child, "When I get to Guiyang, I will definitely come and hit you!"

After he put her on the car, he strode off, looking towards the Art Museum. The situation that day was indeed particularly tense. Lu Qian, Zhang Chang and that group of people all lost their original composure. Everyone was showing a very flustered look, urging Old Zhu to quickly decide whether to leave, when to leave, and the principles of how to leave. From morning on, Old Zhu [unclear text] was busy for most of the day; holding meetings, making phone calls, looking for people, preparing [unclear text], until about four or five o'clock in the afternoon, he finally had some clue.

He lay diagonally on a dilapidated rattan chair, ate three or four peanut candies in a row, and was planning to take a little rest. Suddenly, a thought flashed into his mind. "Ah!" he exclaimed in shock. (39)
