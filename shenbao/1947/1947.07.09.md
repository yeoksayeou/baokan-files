### The Center of War in Shandong Moves South; National Army Captures Gaomi in Jiaodong; Communist Troops from Tusikou Harass Tai'an

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, Eighth of the Month] The center of the war in the Yimeng Mountains has moved south, and the war situation in southern Shandong is becoming tense. Communist bandits, with more than thirteen columns comprising eight columns, are fleeing towards the mountainous area north of Mengshan, near Linyi. The Communist Fourth Column and the Independent Thirteenth Division, totaling over 20,000 troops, fiercely attacked Feixian on the night of the 4th, engaging in fierce battles for three days and nights. By 10:00 AM on the 7th, the defending forces, having achieved their mission of annihilating the Communist bandits, transferred to advantageous positions in the suburbs.

[Special Dispatch from Qingdao, Eighth of the Month] The National Army, after capturing Jiaoxian, continued to advance westward, engaging in fierce battles on both sides of Yaogezhuang. Under the cover of artillery fire, the National Army successfully crossed the river, repelling the Communist troops, and in one fell swoop, captured Dali, located ten li east of Gaomi city, before swiftly entering the county seat. On the morning of the 8th, the National Army completely captured Gaomi. The iron bridge between Jiaoxian and Lancun has been destroyed and is currently being repaired with a temporary bridge. Traffic between Qingdao and Gaomi is expected to resume soon.

The Communist troops who fiercely attacked Shankouzhai east of Tai'an on the 7th were still engaged in intense fighting as of the evening of the 8th. For several days, Communist troops have been shifting and fleeing from the Zibo and Bo areas towards the outskirts of Jinan.

Of the eight Communist columns in the southern foothills of the Yimeng Mountains, one column has broken through and fled north to the Tusikou area in central Shandong. The Sixth Column, which originally fled near Sishui in an attempt to join forces with Liu Bocheng's troops, suffered a severe defeat by the powerful National Army. On the evening of the 7th, it occupied Donglidian, while the remaining six columns, surrounded by the National Army in Feixian and the Tangtou, Qinglongsi, and Niuzhuang areas north of Linyi, are facing difficulties breaking through due to their excessively long supply lines. According to judgments by experienced military strategists, their main force will inevitably be completely annihilated within a very short period.

### The Chinese Communists Steal National Territory and Hinder Reconstruction Work

Chen Wenyuan Speaks at a Revival Meeting

[United Press, Welland, Ontario, Canada, Seventh of the Month] Chen Wenyuan, honorary president of the Chinese Christian Association and pastor of the Methodist Church, stated here today at the International Revival Meeting: "The Chinese Communists are now accelerating the political and economic collapse of China, and all hope for reconciliation between the Nationalists and the Communists has been destroyed. After the Japanese army withdrew, the Chinese Communists stole national territory and then engaged in constant conflicts with the National Army, so that relief and reconstruction work could not be carried out. Prices have soared for a long time, and the end result is unimaginable. It is not too much to say that China is on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition to the economic depression, morality is also declining, which is another result of the war. The black market is rampant, and the practice of hoarding and corruption is prevalent. Political disunity, especially the dispute between the Nationalists and the Communists, is a cause of deep concern for the people of the whole country. Reconciliation between the Nationalists and the Communists is hopeless. The Chinese Communists are now inciting unrest and disrupting transportation. The aim of the Nationalist Party is to emulate Britain and the United States and establish a democratic government, while the aim of the Communist Party is to Sovietize China. Although the Communist Party has claimed to value democracy, its so-called democracy is only a tool to achieve its goals."

### Control Yuan Members File Impeachment Case Against Wang Shijie for Weak Diplomacy Towards the Soviet Union; President Yu Assigns Eight Members to Investigate

They filed an impeachment case on the 7th, impeaching Wang's various negligent acts. After the case was submitted to President Yu, it was decided that eight members, including Bai Rui, would review it. Once the review is established, it can be formally established. In addition, many Control Yuan members have proposed a suggestion to start the work of training and demarcating the borders of Inner and Outer Mongolia as soon as possible.

### Executive Yuan Discusses Mobilization Plan; Several People Appointed to Draft Implementation Outline; Grain徵收Method Still Needs Further Discussion

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The National General Mobilization Plan was reported and discussed at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 8th. At the same time, the General Mobilization Law promulgated during the war was submitted for research. Some people argued that the method was too flexible and should be amended or a new method should be drafted. However, others believed that the first article of the method stated that there were "Resistance War and Nation Building" characters. Although it is not currently a resistance war, nation building is one, so they believe that it is not necessary to amend it. It was then decided to convene a temporary meeting for discussion, and several people were appointed to draft an implementation outline, which focused on several items such as grain徵收, conscription, refreshing local politics, sorting out finances, and protecting the basic freedoms of the people and not hindering the implementation of the constitution.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The grain徵收problem was raised for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 8th. The 徵收volume passed by the subcommittee on the 7th was 60 million dan, but the full amount was 40 million dan. The methods were徵收、借 and purchasing with the tax. After careful discussion, it was believed that borrowing was not as good as徵收, because it may not be returned after borrowing, so it is better to handle all of it by徵收. At the same time, the procedures for purchasing with the tax may be inappropriate, and it was decided that it was necessary to raise it for discussion again, and no results were obtained today.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The meeting convened by Wang Yunwu of the Executive Yuan to discuss the methods of the General Mobilization Plan has been held three times. However, due to too many detailed problems, it is impossible to decide for a while. The grain徵收method has already been submitted for discussion, and the topic of refreshing local politics is being discussed.

According to informed sources, the economic reform plan will be a permanent plan, and the original plan will not have major changes. The National Economic Commission will make a complete review of the case based on the opinions of each group when it opens on the 9th.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] A senior official of the Ministry of Finance said: The so-called strengthening of economic control is to restore some of the wartime measures in view of the current situation.

### The Executive Yuan is Drafting a Peace Treaty with Japan; the Theme is to Eliminate Aggression; Sino-Soviet Relations Must Depend on Future Actions of the Soviet Union

Wang Chonghui Answers Questions on Domestic and International Situation [Report from this newspaper] A reporter visited Minister Wang Chonghui yesterday to inquire about the domestic and international situation. He answered separately as follows: (1) The government's mobilization to suppress bandits is a necessary move at the moment. In the past, the government hoped that domestic problems could be resolved peacefully, so it did not hesitate to make concessions repeatedly. Even if it used force, it hoped to achieve political goals through military means. Today, the situation has changed, and the Communist Party has clearly expressed its intention to overthrow the government, so the government has no other way but to suppress bandits in an all-round way. I believe that the whole country should understand that this move is a battle for the life and death of our country, distinguish right from wrong, and all sectors of society should assist the government with all their strength, so that the war can be ended as soon as possible (2) The issue of the peace treaty with Japan has been under study during the war. The Executive Yuan is currently drafting it. The content focuses on disarmament, compensation, and immigration policies. From our country's point of view, the greatest purpose of the peace treaty with Japan is to reduce Japan's ability to aggress. Before the war, Japan's immigration, 無一 non-略's precursor, all of which must be eliminated. However, our country does not intend to adopt revenge, and allows Japan to be economically self-reliant and survive. This position, the chairman has repeatedly stated, is our country's consistent benevolent style. (3) In diplomacy, our country's position on the Soviet Union has not changed, and the relationship between the two countries has become clearer. How the relationship between the two countries will develop in the future must depend on the future actions of the Soviet side, and it is not appropriate to make malicious predictions at this time. People from both countries should remember that the Sino-Soviet relationship is the biggest key to peace in the Far East. At the same time, the biggest goal of China's Anti-Japanese War was to recover the Northeast, and today the situation in the Northeast is extremely serious.

### The Youth Corps Celebrates its Ninth Anniversary; Chen Cheng Tells the Youth of the Nation to Recognize Defiance and Exert Themselves to Suppress Bandits and Build the Nation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Eighth of the Month] The ninth anniversary of the founding of the Kuomintang Youth Corps falls on the 9th. Chen Cheng, Secretary-General of the Central Corps, specially issued a letter to the youth of the nation. The original text is as follows:

The Communist Bandits Expand Rebellion; It Relies on the Struggle of the Youth

Since the establishment of the Corps, it has been nine years in a flash. In the past eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the revolutionary youth of the whole country, under the great call and leadership of the head of the Corps, concentrated revolutionary new forces, enthusiastically participated in all wartime work, and have made their indelible contribution. Although the Anti-Japanese War has been won, the Communist bandits are expanding their full-scale rebellion, endangering the unity and security of the country and the nation. There are still many places where we rely on the continued struggle of our young comrades. The head of the Corps has even more expectations for our youth. The recent "July 7th" broadcast was full of exhortations. I think the youth of the whole country have all listened. Today, when celebrating the ninth anniversary of the Corps, I will restate its meaning and its daily instructions for mutual encouragement

If the Rebellion is not Suppressed, the Country will be Forfeited

At the beginning of the Corps's birth, its purpose was to achieve the success of the Anti-Japanese War and nation-building. Now that the Communist Party has a "incorrigible bandit nature" and has no sincere intention to repent, it has recently intensified its efforts, not hesitating to sell out the motherland, use Korean Communists and Japanese prisoners of war, and slaughter compatriots. Its deliberate intention to subvert the country by violence and harm the world has been extremely clear. If we cannot unite as a country, be determined, and suppress the rebellion, then not only will the people's livelihood become increasingly desolate, but the entire country will be forfeited. Our government, in order to consolidate national unity, protect the survival of the nation, and save the people in the bandit areas, has issued an order to mobilize the whole country and intensify the suppression of the rebellion. I hope that the revolutionary youth of the whole country, under the leadership of the head of the Corps, will distinguish right from wrong, recognize obedience and respect, abide by national laws, implement general mobilization, and strive together for saving the country and the people.

Feudal Remnants are Corrupt; Must be Eliminated at the Same Time

Second: In addition to the above-mentioned deterioration of the Communist bandits, the enemy we are currently facing also includes corrupt forces such as feudal remnants, which must also be eliminated at the same time, and then the revolutionary camp can be rectified. According to the daily instructions of the head of the Corps, the progress of our country's revolution can be divided into two phases. Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was the first phase of the revolution, the purpose of which was to strive for the survival of the country and the nation, the object of which was the foreign imperialists and the domestic warlords, and the central task of which was to implement nationalism, which was the period of military administration. From the Northern Expedition to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, domestic warlords have been eliminated, and Japanese imperialists have also been defeated. It can be said that nationalism has been largely completed. Therefore, with the defeat of Japan, the first phase of the revolution ended, and the later phase of the revolution began at the same time. The purpose of the later phase of the revolution is to build a new China of the Three People's Principles, to protect the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, to consolidate the security of the country and the nation, and to maintain world peace. Its central task is to implement democracy and people's livelihood, which is the period of transition from political tutelage to constitutional government. The object is the Communist bandits and feudal remnants. These feudal remnants, taking advantage of opportunities, manipulating prices, and disrupting finance, not only deepen the economic crisis, but also reduce the government's prestige, so that the Communist bandits can take the opportunity to carry out their malicious propaganda. It is no different from helping the spread of the Communist bandits. Although the Communist bandits will liquidate them everywhere first, if they do not realize it as soon as possible, then our revolutionary camp can no longer allow them to exist. Our country has previously unveiled three tasks, which should be vigorously implemented.

Deeply Recognize the Unity and Transformation of the Party and the Country, and Strengthen Unity

Third: As mentioned above, today's national affairs are becoming increasingly difficult due to the rebellion of the Communist bandits, and there are still feudal remnants in our revolutionary camp. The head of the Corps, with foresight and vision, has recently given clear instructions that the Party must be in harmony and merge, and be thoroughly transformed. The Party can then unify its leadership and concentrate its forces to cooperate with the policy of suppressing bandits. All our comrades must deeply recognize that the unity and transformation of the Party and the Corps this time is to adapt to the needs of the revolutionary stage, and it is also a good opportunity for the Party and the Corps to be reborn. We must not be deceived by the Communist bandits' divisive propaganda and lose our confidence, nor can we suspect each other and disrupt our steps. We must donate prejudices, unite sincerely, promote the spirit of the Party's previous reorganizations, absolutely believe in the head of the Corps, and obey his orders, so that under the leadership of the head of the Corps, we can move towards the road of rebirth. The transformation plan is now being researched and allocated by the responsible comrades of the Party and the Corps. During this period, our comrades at all levels should especially abide by discipline, do their best, and be consistent, and not be lazy.

Revolutionary youth of the whole country, youth are the vanguard of the revolution and the new life of the country. At this critical juncture of the revolution, it is a good opportunity for young patriots to be loyal to the country. We hope that all will rise up together, actively strive, strengthen the strength of suppressing bandits, and eliminate the Red scourge as soon as possible, so as to complete the Six Industries of revolutionary nation-building.

### Do We Need American Loans? - Dr. Wei Tingsheng's Speech in Shanghai Last Night -

[Our Newspaper News] The Lixing Fellowship Society of this city held its second academic lecture at the Bank of China on the fourth floor last night at 8:00 PM, inviting Legislative Yuan member Dr. Wei Tingsheng to speak on "Do We Need American Loans?". Mr. Wei is a well-known economic expert, and he believes that the attitude towards borrowing should be: borrowing is certainly welcome, but the problem must still be solved proactively by ourselves, and we cannot rely on other countries. In other words, if the United States is willing to help, the problem can be solved faster, but if it is not willing to help, the problem must still be solved. He analyzed that the so-called problem has two parts, one is emergency relief, that is, how to overcome the difficulties, and the other is nation-building, that is, how to carry out construction. First, let's talk about nation-building. Not only is foreign borrowing needed, but we should also use various methods to absorb large-scale foreign investment as much as possible, and use their highly developed technology and excellent talents to help us build. It is like fishing; it is using other people's nets to catch our fish. It would be foolish to refuse to borrow. As for emergency relief, it is undeniable that inflation has reached a very dangerous point. The past two years can be said to be two unfortunate years in history. Today, the crux of all financial, economic, and political problems is due to the imbalance between income and expenditure, but even without American loans, the problem is not necessarily unsolvable. Mr. Wei was summoned by Chairman Chiang to present his views and had several face-to-face talks with President Zhang Qun. He believes that the way to balance income and expenditure lies in (1) rectifying tax collection and opening up new tax sources. Some people think that we should not talk about increasing taxes at this time of economic depression, but he believes that, like treating a disease, the sweat should still come from the patient. (2) Selling state assets, privatizing the income from takeovers and unnecessary state-owned enterprises as much as possible; and ○ changing foreign exchange and financial policies, abolishing foreign exchange controls, and automatically adjusting exchange rates with prices to encourage exports, increase production, and absorb term deposits. And the most effective emergency measure is (4) cultivating financial credit and issuing short-term public bonds to absorb idle funds. At present, the number of people holding idle funds is extremely large, and they are suffering from a lack of investment channels. If the government can give them high profits and show great faith, the people will be happy to buy them. If this principle is implemented and there are no technical problems, financial income and expenditure can definitely be balanced. Finally, Mr. Wei also investigated the reason why the United States has been hesitant to grant loans. It is because the situation in China has not been clarified. The Americans will only help China in two situations: either the Communist Party cooperates with the government, or the Communist Party is eliminated. Facts have proven in the past two years that the Communist Party is a party that destroys humanity and is only a tool of a certain ethnic imperialism. Its purpose is entirely to overthrow the Republic of China, so the government has no choice but to take the path of suppressing the rebellion. At this time of hardship, the people of the whole country must not stand by and entrust the heavy responsibility to Chairman Chiang alone, but must support the government, show it with facts, and actively purchase public bonds to improve the country's situation. In this way, foreign aid will definitely follow.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] The Minister to China of the U.S. Embassy, ​​Walters, is expected to arrive here this Wednesday or Thursday. He is returning to the country at the request of Marshall for consultation. Walters' return to Washington at this time has increased the importance of his mission because of the recent decision of our government to engage in full-scale war. Well-informed sources believe that Walters' trip does not necessarily mean that there will be any drastic changes in the U.S. policy toward China. Walters will immediately report all well-informed information to Marshall after arriving here. Although the New York Times has published information about Walters' meetings with Premier Zhang Qun and Mr. Soong Tzu-wen before leaving China, the State Department has not yet received any formal reports. Other sources said that Walters' return to Washington is timely because since Marshall returned to the United States in January this year, Walters is the first senior American official to report directly to him.

Marshall Focuses on China Problem

### Japanese War Criminal Isoya on Trial. Court Hearing Focuses on Crimes in Hong Kong. No Verdict Yesterday, Debate to Continue Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Japanese war criminal Rentaro Isoya was publicly tried on the morning of the 8th in the temporary war crimes tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense in the auditorium of the Lixing Society Headquarters. Isoya is the third Japanese war criminal to be tried. His crimes focused on Hong Kong. In addition to condoning his subordinates to burn, kill, rape, and plunder, he also implemented a policy of "Japanization" in Hong Kong. The court adjourned at 12:00 noon, and the trial continued in the afternoon. The trial has not yet been completed and will continue today for debate.

### Condoned Subordinate Rape and Murder, Tried to Evade Responsibility but Presented No Evidence to Refute Charges

Isoya is taller than the two demons of Jiu Binglong and Gu Shifu. He wore a military uniform and carried a coffee-colored felt hat and a cloth bag containing documents when he entered the court. He looked very calm. At 9:00 AM, Judge Shi Meiyu and the prosecutors and clerks ascended the court. First, Judge Shi asked his name, origin, and age. He replied that he was from Tokyo, Japan, 64 years old, living in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo, and had served as commander of the 10th Division, Governor of Hong Kong, and Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. The prosecutor then read out the indictment, and the translator translated it into Japanese. Isoya listened intently.

At 9:45, the indictment was read out, and Judge Shi announced that the prosecutor had charged the defendant with (1) crimes against peace, (2) war crimes, and (3) crimes against humanity. He then asked the defendant about his duties after graduating from the Army University. Isoya replied that he had served as an attaché to the General Staff Headquarters, as a section chief in the Directorate General of Education, and in the Army Ministry. He also served as a staff officer in Shanghai for two years and as a battalion commander in Hiroshima from 1920 to 1923. From 1925 to 1929, he was a regimental commander for seven years, and later transferred to the personnel section chief of the Japanese Army Ministry. These positions were unrelated to the Sino-Japanese War. He only served as a military attaché at the Shanghai Consulate General from 1931 to 1932, and then served as a staff officer in the Kwantung Army. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was appointed as the Governor of Hong Kong. After Isoya finished answering, the judge immediately questioned the mission of the Kwantung Army and the position held by the defendant during the July 7th Incident. Isoya said that the Kwantung Army was responsible for defending "Manchukuo" and was not trying to create a "Manchukuo". At the beginning of the July 7th Incident, he was the commander of the 10th Division. At the end of August of that year, he landed in Dagu and went south along the Jinpu Line with all his strength at the end of September, reaching Yanzhou at the end of December. At this point, Judge Shi announced his criminal acts, including: rape and murder by Isoya's subordinates in Taian County, Shandong, robbery and murder in Meng County, Henan, robbery in Boa'ai County, etc., and presented evidence of women being gang-raped to death. Isoya denied all of them and did not present any evidence to refute the charges. He also deliberately confused the time, such as "1937", "Republic of China 26th Year", "Showa 1st Year", etc., and said that the defendant was ordered to come to China to fight, and all actions were carried out under orders and there were no illegal incidents.

At this point, the investigation of the war crimes portion was completed, and then the section on the poisoning of Hong Kong began. Isoya was in Hong Kong from 1942 until he resigned in December 1944. Regarding the poisoning portion, the combined ban on drugs and public assets, he argued that the "gradual reduction method" was adopted, using Taiwan's ten-year ban as a precedent. At the same time, he called Ogasawara Ao to testify. Ogasawara Ao only stated that 5 million taels of opium were distributed to East Asia, and not specifically to Hong Kong. At the same time, it was also a method to completely ban it. The entire statement was a sophistry to obliterate the facts. By this time it was 12:00 noon, and the court adjourned to continue the trial in the afternoon.

### Deported Civilians in Hong Kong, Admitted in Preliminary Hearing But Denied Again Yesterday

The court continued at 4:45 PM, and the questioning focused on the defendant's various crimes in Hong Kong. The court first questioned Isoya: Since Noma Kenzo, the commander of the Hong Kong Military Police, was the defendant's subordinate and often went to the Governor's Office to report on his work, he must have known about the torture and illegal arrest of civilians. Isoya replied that he knew nothing about it. The commander of the Military Police was not a member of the Governor's Office and did not need to report directly unless there was an important matter. Moreover, he only reported once a month, or even once every two months. Therefore, he knew nothing about the illegal acts committed. The court immediately retorted: As the superior, you are responsible for the crimes committed by your subordinates. It also presented the evidence of 38 people who were tortured, submitted by the Southeast Asia Allied Forces Investigation Team. After reading it, the defendant argued that such illegal acts should be the responsibility of the person in charge of such duties. During his tenure as governor, he did strictly prohibit his subordinates from doing evil. He really did not hear about such illegal acts during his tenure. Otherwise, he would have dealt with them strictly. He asked himself that he had done his best to prevent such acts. The court asked whether he could present any evidence to prove that he had done his duty. Isoya said that it was not with him, but he could retrieve it from Tokyo.

The court then questioned the matter of deporting civilians in Hong Kong. The defendant had already admitted this in the preliminary hearing, but when the order was executed, was it done verbally or in writing? Isoya argued: He had not admitted it in the past. There was no such thing as deporting civilians. It was only for the sake of protecting the order of the majority of the people that he had deported criminals three times. After submitting it to his superiors for approval, he verbally ordered the People's Food Department and the Military Police to carry out the order. The court then presented the record of the preliminary hearing on April 21, saying that he had admitted to deporting civilians and had issued orders in the name of the governor. Why did he deny it again? The defendant sophistically claimed that there was a recording error and he had never admitted it. The court then said: In the preliminary hearing, he confessed that he had done this because of the lack of food in Hong Kong. Why is he now contradicting himself? The defendant argued that this was a mistake, with 400,000 people voluntarily returning to their hometowns. Deportation and evacuation cannot be discussed in the same breath. The court then asked: According to reports, as many as 400,000 people were deported to Dapeng Bay at that time. Is this true? At this point, the defendant laughed and said: There is absolutely no such large number. At that time, only four batches of criminals were deported, and each ship carried about 500 people, for a total of only about 2,000 people four times. The so-called 400,000 people probably refer to evacuated people. The court then presented the evidence presented by the Englishman Omensi, stating that from June to December 1941, as many as 500 to 700 innocent people deported to Dapeng Bay died each month. After the defendant asked about the identity of the person, he sophistically claimed that the evidence was absolutely unreliable. The court then showed the evidence of the Chinese representative Luo Xuhuo and nine others, stating that they had met with the Governor of Hong Kong to protest the deportation of civilians but were not allowed to do so. The defendant again argued: In the end, he did not see these representatives. He also made a big statement, saying: When he was sent to Hong Kong to be the Governor, he had the belief of respecting Chinese etiquette, so after arriving in Hong Kong, he tried his best to respect the opinions of the Chinese, and was strongly opposed by people in the country. By the time it was 7:00 PM, the defendant still wanted to argue endlessly. The court ordered that the debate court would continue on the 9th, and he could make further statements at that time. The court then adjourned.

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Publicly Commemorates Yang Guangzheng and Other Martyrs, Foreign Minister Wang Painfully Narrates Japan's Disregard for Humanity

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The remains of Yang Guangzheng, the late Consul General in Manila, Che Zhuo Huanlai, the late Consul in Sandakan, and the martyrs who died in the Manila Consulate General, Cao Jieen, Zhu Shaoping, Yao Zhuxiu, Yang Qingshou, Xiao Dongming, Lu Bingzhu, Wang Gongwei, etc., were publicly commemorated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the China Funeral Home at 3:00 PM on the 8th. The memorial service will be held by all sectors of the society at the Jingzhong Martyr Cemetery in Beijing on September 3rd, Victory Memorial Day. The public memorial ceremony of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon was presided over by Minister Wang Shijie, and more than 300 government leaders, including President Yu Youren, President Zhang Qun, Vice President Wu Tiecheng, and Secretary-General Gan Naiguang, attended the public memorial service. The mother of the late Consul General Yang, his sister Yang Liling, his brother Yang Xianyu, the mother of the late Consul Che, his sisters Zhou Lai, Yuan Lai, his brother Qing Lai, the brother of the late Consul Zhu, Bao Fen, his son Tongsheng, the wife of the late Attached Consul Yao, Yang Xizhen, the wife of the late Clerk Dian, Qiu Tianyou, and the brother of the late Trainee Wang, Gongying, all paid their respects in the mourning hall and accompanied the sacrifice.

In the public memorial service, Foreign Minister Wang made the following speech on the martyrdom of Yang and others: Consul General Yang Guangzheng and nine others were envoys of the Republic of China stationed abroad at that time. Although China and Japan were enemy countries at that time, the killing of envoys of enemy countries was not allowed by the customs of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. The Japanese killed our envoys serving abroad, which is really a great shame of modern civilization. Japanese soldiers are responsible for destroying international law and humanitarianism in the Chinese Philippines and other regions, and they have been successively punished or subjected to international trials. This kind of sanction should be a warning to those who disregard humanity and the law, and can slightly comfort the loyal souls of Consul General Yang and the martyrs.

### Todd Talks About Yellow River Repair and Defense, If the Kuomintang and the Communist Party Can Implement a Ceasefire, The Dike Closing Work Can Be Completed Smoothly

[Our Newspaper News] Todd, Chief Engineer of the UNRRA Yellow River Water Conservancy Project Consultant, came to Shanghai from the Yellow River flooded area last week, waiting for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to implement a ceasefire agreement so as to complete the Yellow River dike restoration work.

According to Todd, except for a length of about one mile that has not been closed, the other Yellow River breaches have been closed. The project in the northern part of the Yellow River is progressing very rapidly, but there are still disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in some areas. However, both parties hope that the dike closing project can be completed as soon as possible.

Todd continued: If the ceasefire agreement can be implemented, there is a 90% chance that the Yellow River will not flood this year, and the flooded area can be restored to fertile farmland. The cost of repairing and defending the Yellow River is estimated to be US$15 million to US$18 million, most of which is supplied by UNRRA (including materials and equipment).

### Ministry of Interior Issues Directive to Provincial and Municipal Governments: Resolutely Practice Economy and Strictly Prohibit Unnecessary Socializing by Civil Servants

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 8th] The Ministry of Interior states that as the nation's reconstruction after the war is difficult, it is necessary to vigorously promote economy in order to shift the social atmosphere. The implementation rules for the promotion of the economy campaign have already been established. All civil servants should lead by example, take the lead in advocating and actively promoting it so that it can be effective. However, it is heard that some places still hold commemorative events for officials who have served for several years, or hold lavish banquets to welcome or send off officials upon their arrival or departure, or engage in extravagance for weddings, funerals, and other major events, and accept gifts.

The Ministry of Interior has already issued separate directives to the provincial and municipal governments to instruct their subordinates to comply. Furthermore, since the National Government promulgated the National General Mobilization Order, the Ministry of Interior has attached even greater importance to the practice of economy. It is reported that during inspection tours, personnel will conduct on-site inspections and guidance.

Editorial

### Eliminate Waste! Eradicate Corruption!

We have already read the full text of the National General Mobilization Act passed by the State Council. We have also read President Chiang's July 7th broadcast address and Premier Chang's speech clarifying the meaning of general mobilization. Standing in the position of the press, especially as a member of the Shanghai media, we wish to sincerely express our views frankly, for the benefit of those in and out of government. We believe that the greatest enemies of general mobilization are waste and corruption!

First of all, we must recognize: why is it necessary to implement general mobilization almost two years after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan? It is simply because the Chinese Communist Party has rejected peace, resorted to arms and rebellion, destroyed construction, and ruined the nation's vitality, ruthlessly damaging and squandering the fruits of victory, which is infinitely regrettable! The government's repeated tolerance and compromise over the past two years has only fostered arrogance and insatiable greed among the Communists, leading to widespread warfare and devastation, almost surpassing that during the War of Resistance. Due to the lessons of the past two years, the government's policies, while well-intentioned, were misguided, ultimately delaying the nation's progress! Looking at the series of disasters in the Northeast and Northwest, we can vaguely foresee the eventual outcome. As Chinese people, how can we not cry out in grief!

The cruelty and belligerence of the Communists, and the true nature of democracy in the so-called "liberated areas," were fully described yesterday in an article entitled "Democracy and People's Organizations" by the Ta Kung Pao, which has always been lenient towards the Communists. As of today, we believe that regardless of party affiliation or lack thereof, anyone who advocates unconditional peace based on a concern for the nation will be able to discern who genuinely seeks peace and who uses peace as a pretense. Now that the National Government has realized that two years of appeasement have been futile, it has decided to mobilize the entire nation to overcome the current difficulties, quell the rebellion as soon as possible, and rebuild the foundation of the nation, in order to fulfill its responsibility to save the people in the war zone and rescue the dying national destiny. It can be seen that this general mobilization is truly a last resort.

President Chiang's statement, "To stand idly by today is to await death tomorrow," is absolutely true!

Now that we know that "general mobilization" is a last resort, and that "general mobilization" simply means that the government requires the people to stand firm in their positions, be serious, abide by the mobilization laws, and contribute their strength and resources, then these government demands on the people are also the obligations that the people owe to the nation. Only when the government calls upon the people's strength and the people respond to the government's demands can a strong and organic whole be formed, which can quell the rebellion and build the nation, thus achieving its goals. However, the current social extravagance and general public's wastefulness are deteriorating rapidly, which is shocking! The cost of one banquet can reach tens of millions [currency not specified] which is absurd! Ultimately, we see that defeated Japan is catching up day by day, while compatriots in various places are suffering from natural and man-made disasters. Can we still bear to play and waste, without any sense of alarm, and truly be like swallows under a collapsing curtain?

Secondly, we want to especially awaken the vigilance of government authorities at all levels! It goes without saying that the general public opposes communism, especially detesting the Communist bandits, but they may not fully trust the government's policies, which is most noteworthy. If the government does not receive the support and endorsement of the people, how can it truly achieve general mobilization? In the past, the government's documents were well-written, but the implementation was sloppy, and laws and regulations quickly became mere formalities. Ultimately, the problem lies in the lack of confidence, sense of responsibility, and willingness to work hard among those involved. The various corrupt phenomena of shirking responsibility, delaying, procrastination, and complacency have made people lose confidence. The cautious follow precedents and are inefficient, while the cunning take advantage of their positions for personal gain and engage in illegal practices, often treating it as commonplace. Thus, the original intention of the legislation, even if it was for the benefit of the people and the nation, has become a disaster for the nation and the people as a result of the execution of the law! This trend has historically waxed and waned with the rise and fall of the nation, and therefore there are particularly many bad examples during times of chaos. The government is currently drafting various laws and regulations to accompany the general mobilization plan, and it is essential to put oneself in others' shoes beforehand, weigh the importance, consult widely, and draft them properly, so that the laws themselves are absolutely sound and the executing agencies have no room for excuse in the future. Furthermore, the officials at all levels responsible for implementation must face reality, thoroughly recognize the importance of the mobilization laws to the survival of the nation, strictly rectify themselves, and make every effort to implement them, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the War of Resistance period, when general mobilization was largely nominal. What is most important is that those who fail to implement effectively must be punished, and those who take advantage of the mobilization laws to disturb the people and engage in corruption must be punished with the most severe penalties. It must be understood that the failure of the nation is due to corrupt officials, and without a clean government, nothing can be discussed. To govern a chaotic world, use severe punishments. The achievements of Zhuge Liang and Zhang Juzheng can be used as a guide for those in power today. We recall the so-called war profiteering, victory profiteering, takeover profiteering, and reconstruction profiteering of the past. Although people have talked about it a lot, how many have been punished severely? The thunder was loud, but the rain was light. Some offenders may even stick up their thumbs, boast and gloat, and retaliate against those who reported them. The result is not only that the government undermines its own credibility, but also implicitly encourages bad people to do evil. The more bad people rise in society, the more good people will decline, and those who are neither good nor bad will gradually flow into the ranks of the bad people. With the decline of morality and the pursuit of private interests, how can "general mobilization" be achieved? As the old saying goes, "If the law is not enforced, those above violate it." In the future, many laws and regulations will be promulgated to accompany general mobilization, and we specially emphasize that the government should first pay attention to the agencies and personnel implementing the laws, and ensure that they are just and impartial, without the slightest bit of laxity. Otherwise, the "bad eggs" will attract flies, and the result of taking advantage of the laws for personal gain will inevitably render the general mobilization, which is related to the fate of the nation and the lives of the people, a failure, and the suppression of the Communist bandits will not be able to end quickly.

Finally, the current situation in China is truly as Premier Chang said, "The people of the whole country must have a fundamental understanding that this is a struggle between the forces of construction and destruction in China." In addition to military suppression of the rebellion, there are also political and economic wars. But politics and economics are fundamentally inseparable. Good economic decisions must rely on a enlightened political environment and must be implemented by honest administrative officials in order to achieve the expected results. Because economic measures are related to money and wealth, it is easy to tempt the greed of corrupt officials. Therefore, in economic mobilization and economic warfare, the eradication of corruption should be the top priority!

### Beware of "Starvation Exports"!

Japan's foreign trade can be opened from the middle of next month, and the Japanese are not only actively preparing for it, but have also recently shouted out a slogan of "starvation exports" in an attempt to return to Southeast Asia and seize the market. The ambition of the Japanese is obvious, which is not only enough to prove that our country's opposition to opening up Japan's foreign trade is justified, but can also be seen as a precursor to the fact that British and American commodities will encounter a strong enemy in the Southeast Asian market.

Japan's slogan of starvation seems easy to win the sympathy of various countries; however, the eyes of people in various countries are sharp, and the Japanese attempt to hide the truth from the world will eventually fail. If the people of Japan today are truly struggling on the starvation line, China has always been generous and kind, and will definitely not oppose opening up Japan's foreign trade and not allowing Japan to find a way out; however, what is the situation in Japan after the war, those in Japan can see very clearly. What is seen by everyone, we have seen many faithful reports from foreign reporters, not to mention; moreover, all measures related to the lives and order of the Japanese people must prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression!

In recent days, many news of provocation against China have been transmitted from Tokyo, forcing us to raise our vigilance. It is necessary to take precautions against minor issues and plan early. Because Australia is dissatisfied with the US's Japan policy, Foreign Minister Evatt has decided to go to Tokyo at the end of this month to personally discuss the Japanese peace treaty with MacArthur; no matter what, our country is a major country in the Far East, not only the country with the deepest interest in Japan, but also one of the factors determining the safety of the Far East; whether for the peace of the Far East or for its own safety, it should speak out at this time and clearly express its position!

### Serious Situation Brewing Between the Soviet Union and Western Countries: The Ideal of "One World" Difficult to Achieve; American Left-Wingers Deeply Confused by the Soviet Union's Actions

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The split between the Soviet Union and Western countries over the Marshall Plan is expected to develop into an explosive situation within two weeks, a situation that has been brewing for many months in the major economic bodies of the United Nations. The summer meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council will open here on the 19th of this month, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe is currently meeting in Geneva, where conflicts may erupt at any time. In addition, there are several other major factors: (1) It is rumored that the Soviet Union may refuse to participate in the United Nations Far East Economic Commission meeting opening here on the 10th of this month. (2) The Soviet Union has refused to participate in the United Nations Small Business Conference opening in Paris on the 9th. (3) The Soviet Union is no longer attending the international trade conference currently being held in Geneva. (4) Yugoslavia has withdrawn from the International Labor Office today.

[United Press International, Washington, 7th] American diplomats predict that the United Nations General Assembly to be convened in the fall and the four-power foreign ministers' conference to be held thereafter may mark the beginning of a long-term breakdown in the post-war Allied relationship. They believe that it is unlikely that major countries will change their current policies, and the theory of "One World" can be said to be dead. Therefore, major countries should seek ways for "Two Worlds" to coexist during the autumn meeting, so as to reasonably guarantee peace. Diplomats are greatly alarmed by the imbalance of power and the increasingly fierce political and economic competition between the East and the West. In particular, the Soviet Union's rejection of the Marshall Plan seems to have made the breakdown of the four powers even more obvious. Therefore, many of them believe that if the illusion of "One World" can be abandoned, and the two forces can be divided, it may be easier to handle the world situation.

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] Observers here believe that the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate under the Marshall Plan, which has divided Europe into two halves, will make it extremely difficult for pro-Soviet elements in the United States to find an excuse for the Soviet Union's actions. In fact, the Soviet Union has made it clear that it does not want to build Europe on any foundation other than its own terms. This has put left-wingers and liberals in the United States in a dilemma. The left-wing newspaper "PM" in the United States can be taken as an example. The newspaper, which has always been pro-Soviet, pointed out in its editorial today that the Soviet Union's gambling move seemed reckless and irresponsible. This move seemed to be deliberate, in order to plunge the world into a chaotic state, so that communism could take advantage of the chaos. Regardless of its motives and results, the Soviet Union cannot escape its major responsibility for dividing Europe and fostering the danger of war. Whether the two worlds, namely the United States and the Soviet Union, can coexist depends on two prerequisites: (1) The United States should provide sufficient and unrestricted material assistance to many countries, and improve their living standards. Food, security, and jobs are the best weapons to resist communism and instability. (2) Assist the neutrality of Western Europe, making it strong enough to be a strong buffer zone. What we want to point out is that American left-wingers and liberals are quite in favor of the Marshall Plan, Wallace being one example. American left-wingers are divided into three factions, namely the right wing, the central faction, and the extreme left wing of the left wing. The reaction of these so-called liberals is quite noteworthy.

### Soviet Representative Attacks Britain and France at the United Nations European Economic Conference: Hopes Dim for Soviet Participation in European Economic Cooperation

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 7th] At today's meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, the Soviet representative fiercely attacked Britain and France, and the British and French representatives retorted, resulting in a fierce verbal battle. Soviet representative Zorin accused Britain and France of colluding to oppose the Soviet Union. He claimed that Britain and France had secretly prepared the Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference behind the Soviet Union's back. It is difficult to understand why British Foreign Secretary Bevin consulted with French Foreign Minister Bidault before the Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference was held. The Soviet Union objected to Britain and France's intention to establish an organization outside the United Nations framework, because this organization would infringe upon the sovereignty of small European countries. The Soviet Union will never agree to European countries falling under American economic control.

British representative and Minister of State McNeil stood up to refute the Soviet representative's accusations, saying: The Soviet representative's accusation that Britain secretly acted behind the Soviet Union's back has no factual basis. May I ask if Foreign Secretary Bevin needs to obtain the Soviet Union's permission before wanting to talk with foreign officials, such as French Foreign Minister Bidault and US Under Secretary of State Clayton? There is nothing "sinister" about the meeting between Foreign Secretary Bevin and Foreign Minister Bidault. The Soviet representative's empty speech wastes the time of the European Economic Commission. Like the Soviet representative, he also knows that the division of Europe is extremely dangerous, and Europe is not a chessboard for leisurely chess playing, but for countless hungry and suffering men and women. French representative and Minister of National Economy Philip then replied to the Soviet Union's accusations, saying: The Soviets always exaggerate everything, which is a dangerous habit. The Soviet representative implied that the Soviet government believes that Britain and France are colluding to oppose the Soviet Union. I must protest this argument. The Marshall Plan is a "new era in history," and I hope that all countries can assist in the reconstruction of Europe under free conditions. The European Economic Committee then adjourned the meeting and scheduled to reconvene at 11:00 am tomorrow.

[United Press, Paris, 7th] Britain and France have not yet given up hope that the Soviet Union will participate in the European reconstruction conference, but given the Soviet representative Zorin's attack on Britain and the United States at today's meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva, this hope seems slim.

### Czechoslovak Delegation Leaves for Moscow

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 7th] The delegation led by Czechoslovak Prime Minister Gottwald will depart for Moscow tomorrow to hold talks with Soviet politicians to discuss the situation after the failure of the Paris Three-Power Economic Conference. Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk and Justice Minister Outlyna are also among the delegates. According to well-informed sources, this trip is also related to Czechoslovakia's acceptance of the invitation from Britain and France to participate in the Paris conference to discuss the Marshall Plan.

### Soviet Newspapers and Radio Stations Criticize British Foreign Secretary

[United Press, Moscow, 7th] Soviet newspapers and radio stations today broadcast a TASS dispatch from London accusing British Foreign Secretary Bevin of following Washington's orders and attempting to use the Marshall Plan to divide Europe into two major camps. This action has been unconditionally supported by French Foreign Minister Bidault. The United States uses aid as bait to stimulate the obedience of certain British and French leaders. But on the whole, these people are not particularly welcome to the Paris conference and have already anticipated its failure. This is the most scathing attack on Bevin by the Soviet newspapers.

### Clayton Arrives in Paris

[Our Report] London, 8th Broadcast: US Under Secretary of State Clayton flew to Paris from Geneva on Tuesday. It is expected that Clayton will stay in Paris for two or three days to hold talks with the highest French authorities, but will leave before the opening of the Marshall Plan conference on Saturday, regardless of the outcome of the gambling.

### United States and Turkey Sign Credit Loan Agreement

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 7th] Turkish Foreign Minister Huca and the leader of the US delegation will sign a credit loan agreement of 100 million US dollars here tomorrow to strengthen the Turkish army and economy. However, the agreement will not be submitted to Congress for approval until the Turkish National Assembly convenes on August 25th.

### Twelve Countries Accept Invitations to Discuss the Marshall Plan for European Reconstruction; Attitudes of Eastern European Countries Are Quite Inconsistent

[Our Report] London, 8th Broadcast: The Austrian cabinet has accepted the invitation to the Paris conference. The Swiss Federal Council has also formally accepted the invitation, but with certain conditions.

[United Press International, London, 8th] The countries that have accepted the invitation so far are Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia, and Iceland, totaling ten countries.

[Our Report] Paris, 8th Broadcast: Several countries within the Soviet sphere of influence have decided to participate in the Paris conference to discuss the Marshall Plan for European reconstruction. According to news from Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union is now very likely to reconsider participating. A Bulgarian spokesperson said that Bulgaria may participate. As for Yugoslavia, although it has been announced by Radio Moscow that it will not participate, it is reported that Tito is very interested in the Marshall Plan and may also participate.

[United Press, Paris, 8th] Countries closely related to the Soviet Union are now divided on whether to participate in the Paris conference to discuss the Marshall Plan. It is reported that Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia plan not to participate in the meeting to be held in Paris this Saturday, while Czechoslovakia has decided to agree to participate.

According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow, Romania, Poland, and Yugoslavia will not participate in the Paris conference. A dispatch from Bucharest stated that the government has decided not to join. Poland and Yugoslavia are happy to accept US loans, but would rather deal directly with the creditor and do not want anyone in between. Semi-official sources in Prague stated that the Czechoslovak government has decided to authorize its ambassador to France, Noske, to participate in the Paris conference.

[United Press International, London, 8th] The Finnish cabinet has voted four to two to refuse to participate.

[Reuters, London, 8th] The British newspapers expressed surprise and pleasure at Czechoslovakia's acceptance of the British and French invitation and its willingness to attend the Paris conference.

[United Press International, London, 7th] Budapest: A government spokesperson said that Hungary has scheduled a special cabinet meeting for the afternoon of the 7th to discuss whether or not Hungary will participate in the Paris conference. According to well-informed sources, the Hungarian Smallholders Party and the Social Democratic Party are putting pressure on the government to accept the invitation from Britain and France, but the Communists have expressed opposition.

[United Press, Paris, 7th] The Italian Communist Party is in favor of participating in the Paris conference, but has put forward many conditions, and it is expected that various countries within the Soviet sphere of influence will follow suit and imitate each other.

### Political Crisis Brewing in Turkey

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 8th] Responsible sources said today that a serious political struggle within Turkey may lead to Prime Minister Peker's early resignation. The Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Okman hurriedly returned to the capital from Istanbul to discuss with President Inönü. It is reported that Peker is at odds with the President and Democratic Party leader Bayar. Bayar accused the current cabinet of being a terrorist cabinet with reactionary tendencies and unable to make Turkey democratic.

### British Government Announces Establishment of Economic Planning Board to Provide Advice on Resolving Current Difficulties

[Reuters, London, 7th] Minister of the Privy Council, Morrison, announced in the House of Commons today the organization and mission of the newly established British Economic Planning Board. The main task of the board is to provide the government with advice on using economic resources to resolve current difficulties and implement long-term plans. The chairman of the board is Sir Nuploden, who will also sometimes chair the tasks of the Economic Planning Board personally. The members will be selected from individuals with extensive experience in industry, labor, and management. The permanent secretary will be selected from the three government departments in charge of trade and industry. With the establishment of the Economic Planning Board, the government and industry can engage in closer cooperation and exchange of views.

### Truman Asks Congress to Pass Immigration Bill to Receive Refugees as a Responsibility of the United States

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] President Truman today sent a message to Congress, urging it to take prompt action to pass legislation allowing a significant number of European refugees to enter the United States. The President did not mention any specific number, nor did he mention any of the immigration bills previously submitted to Congress that have seen little progress. However, he emphasized that it is unimaginable to leave these refugees indefinitely in refugee camps. The President strongly stated that these refugees should not be forced to enter Germany to live with the people who had massacred them. Furthermore, Germany's economy has been devastated by the war, and with the influx of Germans from neighboring countries, the population is overcrowded and on the verge of economic suffocation. The United States government firmly opposes forcing refugees to return to their original countries. The world is now watching whether the United States can fulfill its promise to allow refugees to come to America. It is the responsibility of the United States to assist these unfortunate people together with other countries. President Truman also pointed out that the existing immigration quotas are inappropriate, and special legislation must be passed to allow a large influx of European refugees.

### Bevin Plans to Attend Paris Conference Opening Ceremony in Person, Countries Seem Eager to Avoid Political Involvement as Much as Possible

[Reuters, London, 7th] It was announced today that Foreign Secretary Bevin plans to go to Paris and at least attend the opening ceremony of the Paris Conference. This news has increased interest in the Paris Conference from all sides. So far, it is still unknown whether the Paris talks will be diplomatic or technical. Will participating countries send foreign ministers or economic experts to attend? Although Bevin is going to Paris, it is still expected that the conference will be kept as apolitical as possible and remain strictly economic. If countries such as Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark decide to participate, they will obviously be willing to avoid political involvement as much as possible.

Regarding the development of the conference affairs, if the Cooperation Committee—the Comprehensive Committee—is established on May 15th, it is expected that the four subcommittees can immediately begin collecting information so that the Cooperation Committee can prepare the final report based on this information. It is reported that reports on major issues will be sent to Paris from the beginning of the conference, indicating that Britain and France do not want to waste a moment to start working. For the organization of the Cooperation Committee, Britain and France advocate that it be composed of representatives from Britain and France, one representative from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, one representative from the Scandinavian countries, one representative from Eastern Europe, and possibly one representative from Italy. The number of members of the subcommittee will be approximately the same as this, but in any case, it will not exceed ten people. The first task after the opening of the Paris Conference will of course be to elect members. As for whether the Paris Conference can remain strictly economic without political involvement, it will depend on the following two questions: (1) Whether Eastern European countries other than Czechoslovakia will be invited to attend in Paris; (2) Whether Mr. Molotov will make political demands before agreeing to participate in the work of the various committees.

### Bevin Elaborates on European Cooperation

[This Newspaper] London, 8th (Broadcast): British Foreign Secretary Bevin said today that the door for the Soviet Union to participate in the Marshall Plan to revitalize Europe remains open. It is said that "The Marshall Plan will make an unprecedentedly great contribution to the solidarity of the European nations. Europe is currently bleeding and must be stopped. Britain will cooperate with anyone who is willing to cooperate. At the same time, it will keep the door open to those who are unwilling to cooperate so that they can cooperate one day."

### Last Minute News

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th (Broadcast): The United States took another action today to aid Greece. U.S. Ambassador MacVeagh signed an agreement with the Greek Prime Minister in Athens, stipulating that the U.S. will ship relief supplies worth $50 million to Greece for use.

### Spanish Referendum Not Valued by Britain and France, Franco Goes to the South to Observe

[France News Agency, London, 7th] Regarding the Spanish referendum to decide on the new law of succession to the throne, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office stated that Britain does not value this matter very much.

[France News Agency, Paris, 7th] Regarding the Spanish referendum to decide on the new law of succession to the throne, after London expressed its reaction, French government officials also responded, considering it unimportant. It was said that regardless of the outcome of the vote, it cannot prove the support or opposition of the Spanish people, nor can it be regarded as Franco having the right to speak on behalf of the Spanish people. In short, Franco's Spain cannot change its international status by winning the vote. Foreign countries will not change their attitude towards it because of this.

[France News Agency, Madrid, 8th] Franco flew to Malaga Province in southern Spain this morning. Observers believe this trip is related to a rumor that Franco is inspecting Spanish Morocco.

### UN Security Council Discusses Balkan Issue, United Nations Faces Crisis, Monitoring Greek Northern Border Case Will Cause Fierce Debate

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The Soviet Union is ready to issue an important statement today, responding to the requests of the United States and Britain that the United Nations take action on the urgent situation in the Balkans to restore order. Representatives of the Security Council countries are prepared to discuss this matter and other issues all day, believing that the most critical moment in the history of the United Nations is approaching.

The big question today is whether Soviet representative Gromyko will use the veto power to obstruct the United Nations monitoring of the Greek northern border proposed by the United States. British representative Cadogan has declared that if the Security Council cannot resolve the Balkan issue, then the United Nations mechanism is better off dissolving. U.S. representative Austin also insisted that the Security Council must take some action and use force when necessary. Given the positions of the British and American representatives, if the Soviet Union uses the veto power, it will inevitably cause an unprecedentedly major crisis in the United Nations structure. The nature of Gromyko's statement is kept secret, but according to colleagues, Gromyko will speak in Russian. In recent months, Gromyko has used Russian for important statements. It is expected that Gromyko will defend Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, denying that the turmoil in the Balkans is mostly the responsibility of the three affiliated countries, which is undoubtedly, and will make a strong attack on Greece. There are two other issues on today's agenda: one is to vote on the disarmament implementation plan proposed by the United Nations Committee, and the other is to discuss the application for membership by Albania, Outer Mongolia, Portugal, Ireland, and Transjordan.

Security Council Passes U.S. Disarmament Plan

[This Newspaper] London, 8th (Broadcast): The Security Council disregarded Soviet opposition and passed the U.S. disarmament plan. The vote was nine to one, with the Soviet Union abstaining. But Soviet representative Gromyko warned that this move by the Security Council would cause all disarmament efforts to collapse. Poland also abstained today.

### Jewish Government in Exile Reportedly Established

[Reuters, Florence, 8th] This agency has learned from well-informed sources close to the Jewish resistance movement in Italy that the work of organizing a provisional Jewish government in exile is almost complete. According to the editor of the "Jewish Resistance Movement Report" here, the government personnel in exile will be selected from the Alliance of Free Palestine in Winter, the French Jewish National Committee, the Italian Jewish National Committee, and other groups. The newspaper previously reported on the Provisional Jewish Government. The names of government personnel and the names of Jewish national groups will be kept strictly confidential when appropriate. The Irgun will be the military force of the provisional government, no less than the national armies of other governments. The provisional government will be a democratic government and will not be affiliated with international communism, so it will join the ranks of democratic countries in the event of a new world war. The provisional government will actively establish agreements with democratic countries and do its best to solve the outstanding issues. The Irgun has 110,000 people and is currently fighting the British and will remain secret for the time being.

### Soviet Representative Agrees to Discuss Original Country's Energy Quota System, Insists Atomic Weapons Should Be Destroyed

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] Regarding the "quota system" for world atomic energy to determine each country's atomic energy production, equipment, and atomic fuel, Soviet representative Gromyko expressed his willingness to participate at today's meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission, and said that the Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to establish a system before atomic energy can be effectively controlled. According to this quota proposal, which was proposed by France on June 19, the World Atomic Control Organization should be responsible for allocating each country's atomic energy materials according to the special provisions of the World Atomic Control Treaty.

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] At today's meeting of the drafting subcommittee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, Syrian representative Cole proposed that the Security Council should keep atomic bombs in custody for future use by international peacekeeping forces. Soviet representative Gromyko took the lead in opposing, saying that unless atomic bombs are immediately destroyed, any proposal violates the previous resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and is difficult to accept. The UN General Assembly resolution stipulates that the prohibition of atomic weapons is unconditional, and it is too late now. We cannot violate this resolution. Representatives from China, Britain, Australia, Canada, and Brazil generally agreed with Gromyko, advocating that all atomic weapons should be prohibited domestically or internationally. Representatives from France and the United States believed that this issue should continue to be discussed. This proposal has now appointed a four-country subcommittee to be responsible for drafting the Soviet proposal. In addition, the meeting also passed a resolution advocating that the international army to be organized should maintain world peace and should not be equipped with atomic energy weapons.

### Canadian Ambassador to the Soviet Union

[France News Agency, Ottawa, 8th] It is reported that the former Canadian Ambassador to China and Australia, Mr. Shi Chim, will serve as the Canadian Envoy to the Soviet Union.

### Dutch-Indonesian Situation Tense Internally and Relaxed Externally, Indonesia Proposes Supplementary Note, Dutch Suggestions Largely Accepted

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th (Broadcast): The Republic of Indonesia today stated that it accepts the four Dutch group discussions to establish a temporary government. At the same time, it also expressed its willingness to compromise on the most important fifth suggestion from the Dutch side (regarding the organization of joint security forces). According to Dutch officials: Indonesia's recent good performance indicates military action can be avoided.

[Reuters, Batavia, 8th] The Indonesian Republican Cabinet met overnight and announced that Deputy Prime Minister Setyajid will send a supplementary note from the Republic of Indonesia to the Dutch side, returning to Batavia by Dutch plane today. According to the Dutch News Agency, Indonesian Prime Minister Shahrir said that the Republic of Indonesia is prepared to recognize the Dutch position during the transitional period, but since Indonesia has obtained de facto recognition, it should not be hindered when exercising its joint powers. Shahrir said that the Dutch suggestion of jointly forming a police force is acceptable.

Dutch Attitude Firm, Willing to Resort to Force

[United Press, Batavia, 7th] Dutch qualified people said today that unless Indonesia fully accepts the Dutch conditions for jointly organizing the gendarmerie and other conditions for the temporary government, the Dutch army may take military action in April. The situation has now deteriorated. After Indonesia submitted its reply yesterday, no official response from The Hague has been received here.

[France News Agency, The Hague, 7th] Dutch Queen Wilhelmina has postponed her inspection of various provinces due to the tense Dutch-Indonesian negotiations. The cabinet held a meeting today to draft a declaration to be issued. According to well-informed sources, the declaration will include the Dutch government's decision to resort to force in Indonesia, which will be sent to Parliament for discussion within days.

Indonesia Actively Prepares for War, Java Implements Air Defense

[Reuters, Batavia, 7th] Indonesian Prime Minister Shahrir broadcast to the nation in Yogyakarta tonight, urging them to unite to cope with any eventuality. He emphasized the seriousness of the situation and stressed that the Republic is willing to resolve the problem peacefully. An Indonesian army spokesperson said that Java is now in a "dangerous state" and will use wooden fish as a signal instead of air raid sirens, and ordered the people to prepare for defensive warfare. All guerrilla units should be incorporated into the Republican Army as soon as possible, and defenses in various places will be strengthened.

### U.S. Economic Mission to Japan, Rumors of Further Reduction in Reparations, Japanese Financial Circles Express Optimism

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] The U.S. Schyler Economic Mission will visit Japan for the second time. U.S. and Japanese observers believe this will further reduce Japan's reparations. However, Allied headquarters said that some reparations will not be delayed due to the arrival of the mission. It is worth noting that each investigation of Japanese industry has resulted in benefits for Japan. This investigation may indicate that the State Department intends to strengthen Japanese industry more than MacArthur's concern. Japanese financial circles are very optimistic about this, and the reparations delegations of various countries stationed in Japan are even more concerned, believing that the best result will also delay 30% of the temporary reparations. One foreign reparations observer said: "This is like having two strikes before we even start working." (Note: The English "strike" is homophonous with Schyler.)

### Flying Saucers in Space, Australia Also Appears

[This Newspaper] San Francisco, 8th (Broadcast): It is said that "flying saucers" are still flying in the American sky. According to the Air Force ground forces, they are conducting preliminary investigations and have discovered that "flying saucers" are not a secret bacterial weapon. Two university students said they saw the object as oval, emitting reed light, watching it move in the sky, and disappearing after about three minutes.

[France News Agency, Sydney, Australia, 8th] The "Solar Evening News" reported today that the American moving "flying saucer" in the sky was also seen by six people here yesterday. On the other hand, Sydney University physics professor Dr. Kohden proved the unreliability of the "flying saucer" theory with vision today. Corden ordered all students to stare intently at the horizon. Twenty-two students claimed to have seen "flying saucers." Koh explained that this is an optical illusion.

[United Press, Bozeman, Montana, 7th] Baird, a pilot from the Fanhe Chute Geographic Photography Company here, collided with a "flying saucer" while flying a "P-88" aircraft over the Smoke Leaf Root Mountains in western Montana on the 6th. He said: "The flying saucer" looked like a pearl-gray clam-shaped aircraft with a mesh dome on its head, about 15 feet in diameter and about four feet thick. When the monster flew past his aircraft, he had avoided it, but the flying saucer was defeated by the wind power of his aircraft, and it split into two pieces like a clam, and then entered the Madison Mountains. After the flying saucer fell, he saw several "flying saucers" circling around. Pelter did not say that he was busy flying the plane to pay attention to whether there was anyone in the flying saucer, and forgot to take pictures of it with the camera, and it was too late to think about it later.

[United Press, New York, 7th] General Arnold, the wartime commander of the U.S. Air Force, speculated that the origin of the "flying saucer" has three possibilities: (1) It was invented by foreign scientists and its actions cannot be controlled; (2) It was invented by American scientists and has not yet been perfected; (3) Or it is just a kind of jet fighter. The U.S. Army and Navy authorities are extremely impatient about this matter and are conducting a thorough investigation, but they have not yet made it clear.

[United Press, Stockholm, Sweden, 7th] According to a reporter from the Gothenburg Liberal Party Evening News stationed in Copenhagen on the 7th: flying saucers were also discovered in Copenhagen on the evening of the 6th, the same as those that appeared in the United States. However, Copenhagen newspapers have not yet had news of the appearance of "flying saucers."

[France News Agency, New York, 7th] According to Mr. Barlow, a famous inventor from Stanford, Connecticut, this "flying saucer" was manufactured by the Martin Aircraft Factory under the Ministry of the Navy. It weighs one ton, is controlled by radio, is jet-propelled, and has a speed of 1,500 miles per hour. The pilot speaks with certainty, the professor dismisses it as nonsense

### Yokosuka Port in Japan to be Converted into a Commercial Port

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Yokosuka, which was an important naval port in Japan, has been completely demilitarized since Japan surrendered. The mayor of Yokosuka and the city's Chamber of Commerce have recently suggested to the Japanese government that the port be converted into a commercial port, and it is said that the government has given it much attention. Last year, 250,000 tons of imported materials were unloaded in Yokosuka, mostly food. In the future, the area will inevitably become one of Japan's major commercial ports.

### Japan Actively Prepares for the Reopening of Private Trade

### Pan-American Conference to be Held in Mid-June, Anti-Communism Listed as a Major Issue

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Pan-American Defense Conference will be convened on August 15 in the capital of Brazil. It is heard that the issue of anti-communism will be one of the main topics of the conference. There are about 500,000 communist party members in Central and South America. Recently, since Brazil denied the Communist Party as a legal political party, Chile took over the Communist Party of China's pavilion, and Argentina has also tried its best to exclude the Communist Party, its momentum has been slightly reduced, but its latent forces are still very worrying, which has a great impact on the Pan-American Defense Plan, so the conference plans to discuss it.

### Urging Factories to Form Cooperatives, Aiming to Reduce the Cost of Living, Will Use Cooperative Prices to Compile Index Standards, Wu Kaixian Said It is Beneficial to Both Labor and Management

[This Newspaper] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that he is promoting a new system to urge factories in the city to establish consumer cooperatives. In the future, the distribution of daily necessities will be handled by the cooperatives. Each factory must also supply a portion of its products to the cooperatives of other factories. For example, a match factory that distributes rice at a fair price must supply fair-priced matches to the cooperatives of each factory, and so on, helping each other, similar to the ancient barter method. This will enable workers to obtain all the daily necessities they need at fair prices from the cooperatives, without having to seek them at high prices in the market. When the authorities compile the cost of living index, they can also use the prices of fair-priced items from the cooperatives as the standard, so that the worker's cost of living index can obtain a reasonable result and will not rise excessively. This is not only to seek welfare for workers, but also the factory benefits a lot. However, because this matter requires upfront money, it must be handled by the factory. It is hoped that each factory can understand and work together to promote and achieve its realization. Then, the cost of living index for workers in the city may be lower than in other places.

### Planning Recovery: Labor Hospital - Clearing Hospital Assets, Repaying Private Investment

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Mr. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Welfare Affairs Committee, the committee plans to procure two mobile clinic vehicles and is in negotiations with the Health Bureau for equipping them. The committee has found ten mu of public land in the Hudong District and is in the process of completing the formalities with the Land Administration Bureau to establish a workers' hospital there. In addition, there is a labor hospital on Rue Robert in Huxi, which was originally co-founded with Mr. Pan Gongzhan and others before the war, and was large in scale. During the War of Resistance, fearing enemy takeover, it was changed to a private hospital under the management of Dr. Fan Shouyuan, and since then, private investment has been substantial. The committee now plans to clear the hospital's assets. Regarding Dr. Fan's private investment, it is planned to raise public funds for repayment. After the hospital is recovered, it will be renamed a labor hospital. The necessary funds will be raised through donations from factories and workers. In the future, the hospital will serve workers under the supervision of the Trade Union Federation. If sick workers are certified by the factory union, they can be admitted to the hospital for free treatment.

### Silk Weaving Industry Discount Rate: Assessment Committee to Decide Next Week

### US Military Occupation of Gold Coin Case: Cheng Huazhen Implicated, Requests Court Hearing

[Our Newspaper's Report] After Taiwan's Retrocession, before the National Army was stationed, all matters related to the surrender and takeover were entrusted to the US military. A US Army Lieutenant Colonel named Ivins embezzled four boxes of enemy-gained "Fuzi" gold coins. Through the introduction of Huang Zairong, he entrusted Huang Zai* of Shanghai to sell the gold coins to various *zhuang* dealers in Shanghai. After the case was reported, the District Procuratorate once summoned Huang Zaiyi, who was involved in the case. Subsequently, Cheng Huazhen provided bail for him pending trial. Recently, Ivins was tried in a US court, and the US side telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense of China to order Huang Zaiyi, who was involved in the case, to go to the United States to testify. However, Huang fled after being released on bail, and the police station detained the guarantor Cheng Huazhen. Cheng then submitted a petition to the court requesting a hearing. The District Court yesterday sent a letter to the police station to investigate the circumstances of the case and approved the hearing.

### Jiancheng Flour Mill Dismisses Workers: Demanding Reinstatement, Gathering Crowds and Using Violence, 31 People Sent to the District Procuratorate

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the Jiancheng Flour Company's First Factory was taken over in November last year, there were 131 original workers. The factory felt that there were too many workers, so they used a lottery method to decide who to keep. At that time, 48 people were laid off, and each person was given a severance payment of more than 1.3 million yuan. The factory promised that they would have priority to be rehired if workers were needed in the future. On the 3rd of this month, when the factory reopened, 31 of the laid-off workers, including Kong Qingshou, went to the factory to request reinstatement, but were not allowed. The unemployed workers, relying on their numbers, blocked the car of Gu Zhaoyi, the head of the factory's personnel department, from entering, attempting to use violence. When the police from the Xiguangfu Road Police Station arrived, they snatched the police officer's gun. The police then arrested Kong Qingshou and 30 others who caused the incident. Yesterday, they were sent to the District Procuratorate for investigation, according to Article 150 of the Criminal Law, "Publicly gathering a crowd and using violent coercion."

### Chamber of Commerce Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors: Successfully Concluded Yesterday - Number of National Assembly Representatives and Legislators: Heated Discussion and Justified Arguments - Resolution on Six Measures, Requesting Correction

[Our Newspaper's Report] The 3rd Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, which opened the day before yesterday, held a panel meeting from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm yesterday to review the proposals. The meeting continued in the afternoon to discuss 59 proposals and successfully concluded at 7:30 pm. The China National Industry and Commerce Association and the China National Import and Export Trade Association jointly hosted a banquet for all directors and supervisors at the Central Bank Club. This morning, the association's Standing Committee and Special Committees will meet to discuss the implementation of the major issues passed by the joint meeting. This afternoon at 4:00 pm, they will host the city's news media at the Jingu Hotel.

The directors and supervisors present yesterday included Chen Qinshi, Li Jianting, Deng Chuanshan, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Deyu, Zhai Jingshen, He Yage, Qiao Senrong, Mu Huaxuan, Wang Zezhai, Cheng Ziju, Lu Xiaobo, He Xiaochen, Zhu Huiqing, Ji Dianchuan, Luo Qinghua, and others, a total of 16 people. The discussion on how to argue reasonably to salvage the unfair allocation of seats for legislators from the industry and commerce sectors and the standards for the distribution of National Assembly representatives was the most heated, lasting for an hour and a half. Regarding the 330th meeting of the Fourth Legislative Yuan, which passed a resolution that occupational groups should have one seat in the National Assembly, with industrial and commercial groups accounting for 7% of the total, of which 13 seats were allocated to commercial representatives, accounting for only 3% of the total number of representatives from occupational groups, it was considered a stubborn and unreasonable prejudice against occupational groups. As for the number of legislators from occupational groups, the Legislative Yuan reduced it to 84, with commercial groups accounting for only 5. It was unanimously considered unacceptable, and the following six measures were passed: (1) Telegraph to Chairman Chiang of the National Government and the State Council stating that the nation's merchants vow not to recognize the decision of the Legislative Yuan and should request correction, and telegraph relevant authorities to unanimously advocate this. (2) Telegraph chambers of commerce at home and abroad to take unified action. (3) Organize a special committee and hire legal counsel to jointly seek effective solutions, not ceasing until the goal is achieved. (4) Host the press to explain the truth, requesting the national press to uphold justice. (5) Request the competent ministry to temporarily suspend occupational elections until the issue is resolved reasonably and legally. (6) Convene an extraordinary meeting of representatives immediately when necessary to jointly seek unified action in order to achieve a reasonable solution.

Reform the Tax System, Simplify Procedures

The 59 proposals were divided into four groups for review: taxation, industry and commerce finance, trade, and special matters. They were then submitted to the general meeting for discussion in order. The important proposals from each group are listed below: (1) Taxation Group: The Qingdao Chamber of Commerce and the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce jointly proposed: It is proposed that the government thoroughly reduce various tax rates, consolidate all taxes, and simplify collection procedures to alleviate the people's difficulties.

Resolution: Request the government to order tax authorities to abolish the auditing method and implement standard tax assessment. Tax officials who harass or engage in corruption should be investigated severely after being reported secretly by merchants and the public. The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce proposed: Please ask the government to consider levying property tax in the long term. Resolution: The target of property tax collection should be wealthy families and capital. Request the government to promptly handle land, property, and industrial and commercial business registration to facilitate investigation.

Please Allow Silver Shops to Buy and Sell Gold and Silver

(2) Industrial and Commercial Finance Group: Xu Hongyu, Chairman of the Shanxi Chamber of Commerce, proposed: Please ask the government to quickly approve the restoration of the silver shop industry.

Improve Imports, Implement Linkage

(3) Trade Group: It is proposed to ask the Temporary Import Management Committee to improve import license restrictions in order to benefit merchants and facilitate exports. Resolution: Passed in accordance with the original proposal. In order to save export trade and supplement foreign exchange, strongly request the adoption of an import and export linkage system.

### World YWCA General Secretary Speaks

[Our Newspaper's Report] The World YWCA Joint Conference is scheduled to be held at the Xiling Hotel in Hangzhou from October 15 to 27 this year. Participants include representatives from China, Canada, the United States, India, Burma, Ceylon, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines, Japan, Australia, and countries in South America and Southern Europe, totaling nearly 100 people. Ms. He Huande, the General Secretary of the Association, a descendant of Gu Yanwu, arrived here from Geneva, Switzerland on the 3rd of this month. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00, she met with reporters at the YMCA on Yuanmingyuan Road and said: The World YWCA Conference was originally scheduled to be held every four years. Due to the impact of World War II, it has not been held for nine years. Moreover, this year's conference site is located in the East, which is a historical first, so its significance is very profound, and its mission is even more important than in the past. In addition to deciding on the direction of the World YWCA's work in the future, the conference will also discuss women's living issues and the responsibilities of Christian women. The number of representatives from each country participating in the conference has been decided to be no more than 12 and no less than 2, which is proportionally allocated based on the number of members in each country. China will have 5 representatives and 15 observers.

### Citizens Report Black Market Trading of Gold Certificates: Rewards Given According to the Informant Reward Method

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Economic Supervision Council has decided to reward citizens who report the buying and selling of gold certificates, and the method of issuing bonuses will be expedited. All will be handled in accordance with the "Informant Reward Method for Buying and Selling Gold Certificates" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. All confiscated gold or foreign currency should be sent by the arresting agency to the local or nearby Central Bank for safekeeping, and a report should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and disposal on a case-by-case basis. After the disposal is finalized and executed, the proceeds from the sale of the confiscated gold and foreign currency will be delivered to the national treasury at 50% and used as rewards at 50% in accordance with the provisions of the financial penalty handling method. If the case is disposed of after being reported, 30% should be given to the informant first, and then the remaining amount should be distributed as rewards as described above. The remaining 50% to be used for rewards should be allocated as follows: 50% to the arresting agency, 20% to the assisting agency, and 30% to the sponsoring agency. In the future, the issuance of bonuses for reporting the buying and selling of gold certificates will be handled in accordance with these regulations.

### Warehouse Industry Expresses Opinions on Restricting Warehouse Receipt Trading: Stipulating a Deadline for Delivery Will Affect Business - Social Affairs Bureau Will Solicit Opinions from Cotton Yarn, Sugar, and Other Industries

[Our Newspaper's Report] In accordance with the decision of the First Economic Conference to restrict warehouse receipt trading, the Director of the Economic Administration Department, Mr. Gu, and the Section Chief of the Price Management Section, Mr. Shao, of the Social Affairs Bureau convened the persons in charge of warehouses throughout the city at 10:00 am yesterday to listen to their opinions. According to the warehouse industry: (1) In the past, the warehouse could extend the delivery date after it expired, so there was no rigid restriction. (2) Off-site warehouse receipt trading has nothing to do with the warehouse and cannot be restricted by the warehouse. The warehouse allows delivery based on the seal and the warehouse receipt, regardless of the buying, selling, and transfer of the warehouse receipt. (3) The goods stored in the warehouse are not necessarily for hoarding and speculation, so they believe that if warehouse receipt trading is restricted and delivery is limited to a certain period, customers will inevitably be unwilling to store goods to avoid trouble, and the business of warehouses will be affected. Director Gu stated that the warehouse receipt period will be determined in accordance with the actual commercial situation, taking into account both the merchants' turnover period and the government's intention to prevent malpractices, so as to make warehouse receipt trading more standardized. The Social Affairs Bureau now intends to order each warehouse to report the main daily necessities stored. Director Wu said that if the goods are not delivered after the deadline, the name of the owner will be investigated for verification.

The Social Affairs Bureau is also scheduled to continue convening the persons in charge of major daily necessities such as cotton yarn and food within the week to listen to their opinions on restricting warehouse receipt trading. Then the Social Affairs Bureau and relevant agencies will formulate implementation measures and submit them to the Economic Conference for decision.

### Five Directors and Supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce Discuss Business and People's Livelihood

[Our Newspaper's Report] The directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce come from all over the country. Due to time constraints, the reporter was unable to visit them all. He only spoke with Ji Dianchuan and others from five places: Tianjin, Hubei, Guangdong, and Ningxia. He inquired about the recent business conditions and the people's suffering in various places. The main points are recorded separately as follows:

Severe Food Shortage in Tianjin

Ji Dianchuan, Chairman of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce: There is a shortage of food in the north. Rice in Hebei is sold for 6,000 yuan per jin. Now the food from the northeast can no longer be supplied, and the Grain Department's control over maritime food transportation is too strict, which discourages merchants. Therefore, only free transportation can suppress the price of food in North China. The Communist area is tightly sealed off, and the price of food is lower than that in the free area. The food transported to the north in the future will not flow into the Communist area. The market in Tianjin is depressed, mainly due to the obstruction of the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways. The price of daily necessities is lower than that in Shanghai, and the purchasing power of the citizens is very weak. The citizens hope that the amount of relief materials transported to the north by the Executive Yuan can be increased. The revitalization of the economy in North China is not a simple issue, but relies on the development of the military and political situation. Due to the Communist Party's conscription, the phenomenon of abandoned farming is serious. Due to the early drought, there is no hope for the autumn harvest. If the government cannot provide planned relief, there will be a serious food shortage between August and September.

Abundant Cotton Harvest in Hubei

Li Jianting, Chairman of the Hubei Chamber of Commerce: Wuhan suffered greatly from the enemy's devastation during the war. In the two years since the victory, due to the overall situation, industry and commerce have not only failed to recover the losses of the war, but are also in a precarious state. The biggest difficulty in the industrial sector is that prices are rising too fast, making it difficult to reproduce. In terms of prices, it is about half of Shanghai's. White rice is currently sold for 230,000 yuan per dan. This year's cotton harvest in Hubei is better than ***, and the best quality is Baba Cotton, which can spin 20-count yarn. In addition to self-sufficiency, Hubei cotton can supply other provinces, and waterway transportation is also very convenient. In addition to attending the Chamber of Commerce meeting, I also plan to contact the discount and lending committee. In the past, the mortgage was limited to raw materials, and machinery and real estate could not be mortgaged, which is unreasonable. I have met with President Zhang to discuss this matter, but there is no concrete decision yet.

Rising Silk Prices in Zhejiang

Chen Qinshi, Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce: The spring and summer silkworms in western Zhejiang are both good this year, so the farmers' lives are still good. The National Bank's loans this year are very sufficient. For example, each silk weaving machine can be loaned 3 million yuan, and loans of more than 1 billion can be obtained by mortgaging silk. Silk prices have risen in the past month, so farmers have benefited greatly. The local order is very good, but the folk customs need to be improved. In terms of transportation, the government is hoped to loan more than 1 billion to accelerate the completion of the highway from Nanxun to Huzhou. This line, combined with the Sujia Highway, connects the transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which is of great significance to the prosperity of the economic relations between the two provinces. The mulberry trees in western Zhejiang were greatly damaged during the war, and the number of existing mulberry trees is quite limited. It is estimated that it will take three years to recover.

Rampant Smuggling in Guangdong

He Yage, Guangdong Chamber of Commerce: The economic situation in Guangdong is relatively stable. Prices are about 30% lower than those in Nanjing and Shanghai. Industry and commerce do not feel the lack of raw materials and are relatively prosperous. However, the current flood is a major blow to the economy of South China. The sugar mills and weaving industries in Guangdong are developed, and the sales reach Southeast Asia. However, due to the large difference between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate, imports and exports are difficult. The Guangdong coast is more than a thousand miles long, and smuggling is rampant. The fundamental solution is for the government to establish an agreement with the Hong Kong government to effectively crack down on it. The inflow of overseas remittances into Hong Kong and Shanghai is an even greater loss. It is estimated that the total amount of overseas remittances from the Americas is more than 200 million US dollars per year, and overseas remittances from Southeast Asia have not yet been calculated.

Mexico Treats Overseas Chinese Harshly

Deng Chuanshan, Mexican Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce: There are about 10,000 overseas Chinese in Mexico, all of whom are engaged in grocery stores, restaurants, department stores, and so on. In the past, the *government unilaterally stipulated: New overseas Chinese customers were not allowed to enter the country, and old customers were allowed to return to the country for a period of two years, and were not allowed to enter the country after the deadline. In terms of the commercial sector of overseas Chinese, they are treated equally with Mexicans in law, but they are arbitrarily fined under the pretext of "unsanitary" everywhere, oppressing overseas Chinese. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Mexican people's respect for China increased. At the same time, the Chinese government is also negotiating with the Mexican government to sign a commercial treaty, and it is expected that the situation will be improved in the future.

Ningxia Awaits Development

Qiao Senrong, Director of the Ningxia Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce: Ningxia is the gateway to the northwest national defense of our country. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese army never reached the territory of Ningxia Province. Only the provincial capital was bombed twice. The Communist bandits only invaded two-thirds of Yanchi County, which was recovered by the National Army this spring. Therefore, Ningxia suffered very little loss during the war. Governor Ma Hongkui is diligent and loves the people, and is deeply supported by the people. The highway transportation in the province is smooth, and goods flow smoothly. Helan Mountain is rich in minerals, but it lacks funds and technical personnel. The great treasure has not been developed. "The Yellow River has a hundred harms, but it only enriches one sleeve," and the Hetao area is in Ningxia. There are tens of thousands of miles of fertile land on both sides of the Yellow River, but the population is scarce, and the land cannot be used to its full potential. It is hoped that industrialists and businessmen with long-term vision will invest in the northwest. Ningxia is rich in medicinal materials, wool, and leather, all of which are good export products for exchanging foreign exchange. If scientific processing is added, the economic future of Ningxia can be expected, and it is located in the border area, so its importance in national defense economy cannot be ignored.

### Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, Xu Letian, Tried - Summons All Witnesses - Interrogation of the Suspension of Distribution

[Our Newspaper's Report] Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the Shanghai District, was tried by Prosecutor He Huimin in the District Procuratorate yesterday morning on charges of corruption and embezzlement.

The interrogation lasted from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, and they were released on bail separately. The investigation yesterday was based on the accusation of the Coal Industry Association that, between December last year and March this year, the Committee stopped the distribution to coal merchants without an order from the Ministry, causing more than 1,100 coal merchants to be in a state of stagnation. The market price of coal per ton rose rapidly from more than 100,000 yuan to more than 1 million yuan. The court inquired in detail about the above-mentioned facts.

On June 2nd of this year, Wang lent it to Fu Zhongren, who was studying at Guanghua University. Fu then told him that it was inconvenient to carry the gun to school, so he deposited it at the home of his friend Feng Xianzhao. At that time, a United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) staff member, Wang Kebin, was being threatened by hooligans, so he borrowed the gun from Feng through his friend Lin Genkang for self-defense. On the sixth of last month, Wang accidentally fired the gun while playing with it, injuring his left knee. He admitted himself to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. After investigation by the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct, he was found to be using an unlicensed handgun, which endangered public safety.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

(1) Encroachment on Ancestral Property

Pan Binyong asks: A certain family has inherited several houses, which they have occupied for a century. In the years 22 and 23 of the Republic (1933 and 1934), A reported the land registration in his own name and held a map and property certificate as proof. Recently, due to the Land Bureau re-registering, it announced that old maps and certificates are not valid and must be re-registered and issued. Unexpectedly, a certain B from the same clan intended to encroach on the property. While A was away, B privately reported the registration without authorization. When A found out, he argued with B, who claimed that it was public property and had an old division agreement as proof. Both sides were unable to reach an agreement. I would like to ask: (1) Does A have absolute ownership of the house that has been occupied for a century? (2) Can the map and certificate of the first registration reported by A in the years 22 and 23 of the Republic be submitted as proof? (3) When A reported the registration initially, B did not raise any objections. Now B has privately registered without authorization, using the old division agreement as an excuse. Is there any suspicion of encroachment?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai answers] If B claims that the houses are jointly owned and A has paid taxes for the entire century of occupation, then A can sue the court to confirm his ownership of the houses and request the local government to change the registration. The map previously obtained by A can be used as evidence in the lawsuit. B's private registration to attempt illegal acts constitutes the crime of illegal occupation of real estate under the Criminal Law (Article 320, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law).

(2) Unreasonable Rent Increase

Yu Xiaoru asks: A rented a room in the city from B at the end of last year through an intermediary, stating that the term would be six years. B is a widow, so the house ticket was issued in the name of her son (B was still a minor at the time). Now B has gone elsewhere and her uncle, C, is in charge of the house. Because C disagrees with A, he is using excuses to force A to move out, otherwise he must increase the rent. A is unable to pay any more rent and is extremely anxious. There are several questions now. I would be grateful if your lawyer could answer them: (1) Is the lease contract signed between the widow B and A still valid after being transferred to C for management? (2) Can A refuse to pay if C increases the rent unreasonably?

[Lawyer Qin Liankui answers] (1) An existing lease relationship does not lose its validity due to changes in the owner or manager. (2) The Civil Code does not allow for the rent of a fixed-term lease to be increased or decreased at any time. Even if the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After Recovery allow for a possible increase in payments, but an increase was made not long ago, and now there is another increase. Circumstances have changed, and there is no such speed. A can state the reasons and urge him to reflect. If it is unavoidable, he can sue the court for a determination.

### Many Visitors to Fuxing Park Lament; Red Dancer Bitterly Ill Takes Her Own Life; Sends Suicide Note, Calmly Takes Poison; Foresaw Burial Plot Before Death; Epitaph Inscribed with Small Bird; Unbearable Sadness of Life Story

[Report from this newspaper] Lin Daiyu-like dancer, Fang Zhen (pictured), 25 years old, from Guangdong, has a graceful figure and a beautiful appearance. Three years ago, she used the alias Shi Qimin to dance at the Metropolitan Dance Hall. She was quite knowledgeable and spoke eloquently, so her reputation soared and she was very popular for a time. Later, due to suffering from lung disease and pleurisy, she stopped dancing to recuperate. As her illness worsened, she dressed up and committed suicide by taking poison in Fuxing Park at 4:00 PM on the 6th. After the Lujiawan Police Station discovered it, she was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but died on the morning of the 7th. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Cao of the District Procuratorate went to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to examine the body. Her uncle, Zhu Chunshi, her cousin, Zhu Fangju, and her former patron, Zeng Yongxiang, claimed the body for burial. Fang lost her parents early and was lonely and helpless, living with her uncle's family. Living under someone else's roof made her depressed and unhappy. The root of her troubles had already been planted in her childhood. She suffered from lung disease five years ago. Since she became a dancer, her business was quite good, but Fang's weak body felt increasingly overwhelmed. Before long, she stopped dancing. At that time, for the sake of her health and happiness, she spent her earnings on hiring famous doctors to treat her, which cost a lot, but her condition did not improve. She then followed the doctor's advice and

Moved to Another Place for Treatment

In the autumn of that year, she went to the Taihu Lakeside Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Wuxi for treatment. On the 22nd of last month, she was forced to return to Shanghai due to lack of funds, temporarily residing in room 426 of the Xiang Sheng Hotel on Shaanxi South Road, and went to Dr. Qi Yun's clinic at No. 120, Nanjing Road for examination. The X-ray results showed that her left lung had rotted and that eight rib bones had been infiltrated, and there was no hope of recovery.

Fang thought her future was bleak, and the thought of suicide arose spontaneously. At this time, there was still a sad piece of music. A dance patron, Zeng Yongxiang, whom she had not seen for several years, suddenly met her at Dr. Xu's clinic. Zeng was from Guangdong, and due to their shared hometown relationship, they were very close. Later, Zeng went to another port to do business. Fang also stopped dancing to recuperate, and they had not seen each other for several years.

Sudden Reunion

They were overwhelmed with emotion. Zeng escorted Fang to the Xiang Sheng Hotel (this room was opened by Hongye on his behalf). Zeng saw that the room was small and opened a larger room, No. 432, for her to live in. Although Zeng tried to comfort her in every possible way, Fang's determination to die was firm. Knowing that lung disease was contagious, she did not want to harm anyone, so she sold all her meager jewelry and belongings, obtaining more than ten million yuan. Before committing suicide, she made various meticulous arrangements. First, she went to the China Coffin Company at No. 835, Xin Zha Road, and ordered a coffin, paying 5,550,000 yuan, and paid 1,500,000 yuan for shrouds and quicklime. Then she went to the Hongqiao Public Cemetery and ordered a burial plot, and ordered a

Stone Tablet

From the Jianhua Marble Company nearby and designed it herself. A small bird was carved on the top of the tablet, with flowers inlaid on both sides. A "ten" character was carved under the bird, and the words "Fang Zhen" were carved below. She paid 4,000,000 yuan. When everything was ready, she wrote a letter in pen on July 5 to the Lujiawan Police Station, sent from the "12" post office, stating: "To the honorable officers, I know that suicide is a criminal act, but I have no parents and am lonely and helpless. I now suffer from lung disease. Dr. Xu Qiyun has diagnosed me as being terminally ill and there is nothing to keep me in this world. I have no choice but to commit suicide. Fang Zhen." She put a fingerprint at the end of the letter. After the letter was sent, she went to Fuxing Park calmly at 4:00 PM the next day, quietly entered the deep forest, and took a large number of sleeping pills to commit suicide. White leather shoes and a white leather bag were placed on the sidewalk outside the deep forest, so she was discovered. She had a "Fang Zhen's Confession" hidden in her arms, the gist of which was the same as the letter to the police station, but it included the address of her cousin, Zhu Fangju, at No. 17, Lane 303 (Shunqing Lane), Qipu Road, asking her to come and collect the body. After the police station investigated at that address, there was still a box left

Expensive Perfume

In the box, there was a bottle of expensive perfume, with a note saying that there was a bottle of expensive perfume in the box, please sprinkle it all over the body during the burial. Her cousin, Zhu Fangju, had already followed the will. Also, before committing suicide, Fang burned all her previous photos, so there was no portrait of her in front of her spirit. The photo published in this newspaper was found after much searching and is the only one that remains.

During the derailment, the north-south streetcar traffic on North Sichuan Road was suspended. The streetcar from Qiujiang Road to Wuchang Road stopped end to end like a long snake.

Currently, there is no other term that adequately encompasses these goals, hence the adoption of the term "Basic Education."

The Main Objectives of the Conference

The main objectives of this Basic Education conference are: (1) To gather data on basic education in various countries in the East and South Pacific from various experts. This type of data should be of considerable value to other countries and UNESCO.

(3) To report to the conference participants on the status of basic education work in other countries around the world. (4) To familiarize participating experts with UNESCO's situation, particularly UNESCO's intentions and plans for basic education. (5) To further review the experimental work that should be carried out in the Chinese basic education demonstration design, to determine norms for use as reference for other countries. (6) To explain the importance of greater efforts in basic education work around the world and to encourage them. (7) To further develop the technology of regional meetings for future application in other regions of the world. (8) To demonstrate UNESCO's deep interest in the East and South Pacific region.

Scheduled Agenda

### Dean of Xiamen University's College of Liberal Arts Urgently Advocates Promoting Romanized Pinyin; Considers Chinese Characters as Our Nation's Ancient, Worthless Broom; Unable to Quickly Eliminate Widespread Illiteracy

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhou Bianming, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at National Xiamen University, flew from Xiamen to Shanghai at the invitation of the Ministry of Education and went to Beijing last night to participate in the preparatory meeting for the Far East Regional Conference on Basic Education. Zhou studied linguistics in Europe and America in his early years for over twenty years and is a renowned linguist in our country. In recent years, he invented Mandarin Romanization (Pinyin) to replace the currently used Chinese characters, marking a major revolution in the history of language. This trip aims to propose a concrete plan for language reform at the preparatory meeting for the Basic Education Conference. In an interview with reporters yesterday, he stated: Basic education should first pay attention to the issue of tools, which can be studied from both international and domestic perspectives. From an international perspective, we believe that the tool of education should not be an artificial language created out of thin air but should utilize a universally used international language such as English. From a domestic perspective, the fact that the ancient, worthless broom "Chinese characters" cannot quickly eliminate widespread illiteracy is a fact known to the world. Why then should we not abandon the old and seek the new? Therefore, our country today should, like Turkey and Japan, resolve to resolutely adopt Romanized Pinyin, which is easy to teach, learn, read, and write, and caters to the trend of "one script for the world." We should suggest to UNESCO: (1) Urgently convene with our government to quickly pass a unified system that can be internationally recognized so that linguists can concentrate on the research of its various sub-topics, avoiding wasting energy on trivial and meaningless debates. (2) Establish research institutions affiliated with suitable universities in our country to cultivate talents as much as possible so that the new system can be quickly promoted from top to bottom. (3) Donate the latest modern printing equipment to our research institutions to quickly publish reading materials for widespread promotion. We should also suggest to our government: (1) It is hoped that the government can issue a clear decree to actively promote this plan. (2) A clear decree should be issued immediately stipulating that all telecommunications must use Romanized Pinyin. (3) Special funds should be raised to cover the expenses of various institutions expanding this business.

### Hong Kong Charity Tennis Tournament; Clash of North-South Heroes; Ye Guanxiong Suffers from Fever; Performance Not Ideal

[Our Newspaper's Hong Kong Airmail] The charity tennis event for disaster relief, postponed due to rain, staged a prelude on July 3rd. Originally a singles competition, it was changed to a doubles exhibition match due to Guanxiong's fever and Wang Wenzheng's illness, featuring Lai Guanxiong and Xu Weipei against Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng.

First Day of Competition

Changed to North-South Singles Exhibition

The four North-South heroes competed, but both sides had ill players, resulting in a less than stellar performance. Xu Weipei's performance was the best. Ye Guanxiong, despite his illness, only showed his skill in the fourth set, with several well-placed shots near the sidelines.

Tao Guanqiu also performed well, his serve was powerful, and his short strokes and quick attacks were agile with good angles. Unfortunately, Wang Wenzheng was not at his best, frequently hitting "dead balls" and squandering several high-pressure opportunities to win, failing to block effectively at the net, rendering him less effective than the lively and powerful Ye-Xu duo. Tao-Wang lost due to a slight difference in skill.

The match adopted a best-of-five-sets format. Xu served first. In the first set, Wang and Tao took two games first, but were forced to 3-2 by Ye and Xu, with Wang and Tao falling behind. Ye and Xu then won the first set 6-4. The second set was the most contested, with both sides tied at 4-4 and 5-5. Ye and Xu then won two more games, overwhelming Wang and Tao 7-5, creating a 2-0 lead.

By the third set, the atmosphere was more relaxed. Tao and Wang fought back hard, winning a set 6-4, making it 2-1. In the fourth set, Wang Wenzheng's fatigue was evident, unable to withstand the fierce attacks of Ye and Xu, losing another set 2-6, ending the match 3-1, with Ye and Xu winning. Finally, Jiang Daozhang, a veteran of the Davis Cup, played a singles exhibition match against Tao Guanqiu. Despite enduring four sets of intense battle, Tao remained unstoppable, defeating "Old Jiang" 6-2.

Second Day of Competition

Davis Cup Veterans Suffer Dual Defeats

The weather on the 4th was excellent. Singles exhibitions continued at the Chinese Recreation Club. Unexpectedly, Ye Guanxiong was unable to participate due to a fever. The order was temporarily changed, with Tao Guanqiu facing Xu Weipei and Wang Wenzheng facing Jiang Daozhang. This change completely altered the situation. The two Shanghai players overwhelmed the Hong Kong players, both winning two consecutive sets.

The match between Guanqiu and Weipei was particularly exciting. Guanqiu excelled in momentum, frequently using powerful baseline strokes to suppress Weipei. Although Weipei occasionally blocked at the net, he lacked the strength, so Guanqiu was ultimately able to win two consecutive sets with scores of 6-2 and 6-3.

In the final match, Daozhang faced Wang Wenzheng. "Old Jiang" still had some fight at the beginning, but later his fatigue became evident. Wenzheng won easily, also winning two consecutive sets with the same score of 6-3, 6-3. The pair of old Davis Cup players suffered dual defeats, giving a sense of heroes in their twilight years.

Another Charity Match to Be Held

Ye and Tao to Battle for Supremacy

As a result, it remains undecided who is the tennis king. According to Tao and Wang, their delay in returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong is both for the charity event and to compete with Hong Kong's new champion, Ye Guanxiong, hoping to face "Little Ye."

The charity event organizers feel the same way. To increase charitable donations, they plan to hold another charity match next Tuesday (the 8th), following the original order, with Ye Guanxiong facing Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng facing Xu Weipei. If this can be arranged, the performance of these two ideal pairings will surely satisfy fans.

### Ninth Act of Ping Pong Finals; Post Office Team Comes from Behind; Hualian Hua Wins First, Loses Later

The ninth act of the eight-team finals of the Second Ping Pong League was held at the Central Auditorium last night at 8:00 PM, with over 300 spectators. Shen Baihong and Wang Yishan served as referees. After the initial contact, Liu Zaoshi of Post Office A used his skills to easily defeat Qin Yuheng in straight sets. In the second group, Jiang Chunshan, a veteran of Post Office A, launched fierce attacks, but Gu Jinxiang of Hualian Hua remained composed, countering with long shots and remaining remarkably steady, ultimately defeating Jiang. In the third group, Xu Zhifu of Hualian Hua demonstrated both intelligence and courage, delivering an excellent performance, winning 3-1 against Zhou Xintang. In the fourth group, the main battle was between Li Feixiang, captain of Hualian Hua, and Li Guangyao, a major player of Post Office A. The two Lis engaged in a fierce battle. Feixiang had lost to Guangyao in the sectional finals of the previous tournament. Meeting again, he dared not be careless, taking the lead all the way. Guangyao was unable to counterattack, losing 3-1, and Feixiang avenged his previous defeat, creating an absolute advantage of 3-1 for Hualian Hua. The players of Post Office A lost color, as Zhang Qihong in the fifth group did not seem to be a match for Zhou Weixin of Hualian Hua. Unexpectedly, Qihong remained exceptionally calm and cautious, while Zhou lost his composure due to nervousness, frequently committing errors. Zhang Qihong defeated Zhou Weixin in straight sets, and his contribution to turning the tide for Post Office A was immeasurable. In the subsequent two groups, Post Office A took advantage of the opportunity, and Post Office A defeated Hualian by a score of 4-3, which can be considered fortunate. The results are as follows:

(Post Office A) (Hualian Hua) (Score)

Liu Zaoshi Qin Yuheng 3-0

Mei Chunshan Gu Jinxiang 0-3

Zhou Xintang Xu Zhifu 1-3

Li Guangyao Li Feixiang 1-3

Zhang Qihong Zhou Weixin 3-0

Zhuang Kunrong Liu Baotai 3-1

Wang Huijun Lu Yunzhang 3-0

Tonight at 8:00 PM, the tenth act of the finals will continue at the original location, with First Division Champion Star Team facing the Fourth Division Runner-up Green Team. Dai Yongquan and Shen Baihong will be the referees, and Hu Shansheng will be the recorder. The lineup of the Shanghai Star Team is strong and can be considered top-notch, but when they played the second time, both generals Lu Hanjun and Li Zongpei were absent, and the performance was not outstanding. The Green Team recently defeated the strong Hualian, showing their prowess. They face a formidable enemy again tonight, so let's see who wins.

(Shanghai Star) Xue Xuchu (Captain), Fu Qifang, Wang Changhou, Yu Cheng, Cheng Aixin, Huang Gaoyuan, Huang Zhijun, Huang Zisong, Li Zongpei.

(Green Team) Wang Yishan (Captain), Qin Duyan, Li Rongjiu, Chen Yilong, Dai Yixing, Li Peiran, Chen Yinzhou, Liang Hui, Liu Jiarong.

### Five Measures Decided by the Cotton Cloth Industry to Assist the Authorities in Suppressing Old Cloth Prices, While Negotiating with the Textile and Construction Bureau to Improve Distribution Methods

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Due to the soaring prices of cotton yarn and cloth, the authorities have sternly discussed the matter with industry leaders, urging them to quickly find ways to suppress prices. More than a dozen cotton cloth businesses have been inspected one after another. As a result, there have been no large transactions in the cotton cloth market in recent days. Some large firms have even taken the opportunity to close for the summer to avoid disputes. However, yesterday's market prices remained stable with a firm undertone. Since the textile and construction bureau's opening, the small quotas and high prices have ultimately driven up market prices. The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Business Association on Shanxi Road, recognizing the necessity of complying with government orders and lacking confidence in suppressing prices, convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at 3 PM yesterday. They unanimously agreed that times are difficult, and cotton yarn and cloth are under close scrutiny from all sides. They resolved to cooperate in stabilizing prices, and the resolutions included: (1) Since the Longtou cloth textile and construction bureau has not opened for a long time, the market will temporarily suspend trading. Operations will resume when the supply normalizes, to avoid stimulation. (2) Strict control of the market will be enforced, and non-association members will be prevented from entering the market. (3) Members of the brokerage association handling transactions in the market should rectify themselves and report the parties they dealt with to the association. The association will investigate whether their transactions are legitimate. (4) Black market transactions outside the market are absolutely prohibited. (5) The market will be open from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM, with the afternoon closed. The above items will be announced jointly by the association and the brokerage association. A persuasion team will be organized by the directors and supervisors to take turns persuading against black market activities outside the association. On the other hand, the association's leaders will negotiate with the Textile and Construction Corporation on improved distribution methods to reassure the public. According to a certain authority in the industry, May and June of the lunar calendar are typically slow months. However, after the textile management committee was shut down, the textile regulation committee has yet to establish a regular method for supplying cotton yarn, resulting in a significant reduction in textile mill production. Furthermore, new cotton yarn prices have just been negotiated, and there are rumors of further negotiations. Hearing this, merchants inevitably start purchasing and transporting goods again. This is the reason why the market has inevitably risen recently. In fact, the extent of the increase is limited. Taking the most closely watched Longtou fine cloth as an example, compared to ten days ago, it has risen from 420,000 to 460,000, an increase of about 10%. If there is a solution for the yarn market, it will not be difficult to suppress the price increase of cloth. It is also said that the price of dyes has recently increased again. The main reason for the increase in colored cloth does not seem to be the raw cloth but the dyeing and processing costs. Taking Indanthrene Blue as an example, the dyeing cost is greater than that of the raw cloth.

Mostly Closing Transactions; Small Rebound Seen in Chinese Stocks Yesterday

Chinese stocks saw more closing transactions yesterday due to a gloomy atmosphere in the industry and unfavorable conditions, leading to oversupply. Extensive help for storage also appeared on the market, while new buying power was limited, ultimately curbing buying sentiment. Major players in the industry gradually became shaken, with initial upward momentum dissipating before closing. Tight credit conditions further contributed to the decline, except for Wuhe and Yonggong.

The morning opened with lower prices. Di Yong Yarn opened with a nominally rising but actually falling trend. After the opening, No. 133, No. 69, and No. 65 were sold at 10,800 yuan, while No. 89, No. 76, No. 163, and No. 117 advanced to 11,000 yuan. No. 57, No. 207, No. 158, No. 91, No. 14, No. 185, No. 218, No. 142, and No. 233 sold heavily, forcing prices down to 10,625 yuan. No. 235, No. 197, No. 85, No. 97, No. 61, No. 232, No. 89, No. 157, and No. 75 still showed strong buying interest, with Tongyi taking the lead in raising prices to the limit.

Yonggong, through No. 223, and Di Yonggong, through No. 105 and No. 226, and Wuhe, through No. 222, also reached their limit. Di Yong Yarn rose to 11,180 yuan. No. 235, No. 224, No. 94, No. 223, No. 197, No. 22, No. 102, No. 24, No. 4, and No. 23 sold off. Although No. 8 of Yizhong and No. 56 of Zhongnan bought in, prices still dropped to 10,700 yuan. By 10:30 AM, No. 82, No. 54, No. 89, No. 104, No. 160, No. 183, and No. 102 recovered to 11,000 yuan, but prices then fell back to 10,750 yuan. No. 224 and No. 202 briefly advanced to 10,900 yuan. No. 235, No. 142, No. 153, and No. 152 constantly supplied and sold. No. 223 and No. 224, after buying in, suddenly sold, and No. 85, No. 212, and No. 14 also sold, falling to 10,450 yuan by 11:45 AM.

No. 218, No. 85, and No. 104 took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, rebounding to 10,600 yuan. No. 102, No. 218, No. 117, No. 231, No. 199, and No. 154 closed out their positions, with retail investors selling off. Before the midday close, prices retreated to a low of 10,230 yuan. No. 231, No. 76, and No. 223 bought in to cover, and the noon close rose to 10,450 yuan. After the close, the asking price rose to over 10,500 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong Yarn was flat, Yonggong rose by 10%, Xinnuo fell by a weak 0.5%, Xinguang fell by a strong 0.5%, Meiya, Huafeng, Jingfu, and Qinxing each fell by 10%, Xinhua fell by a weak 15%, Zhongfang was flat, Tongyi rose by 0.5%, and Wuhe rose to the limit. Datong, Zhongsi, Guohuo, Cement, and Neiyi each fell by about 0.5%, Lian fell by a strong 1.5%, Jinglun fell by 10%, and the remaining stocks saw minor gains and losses. For forward contracts, Yong Yarn saw a slight decrease, Xinnuo, Xinguang, and Qinxing each fell by about 0.5%, Meiya, Huafeng, and Jingfu each fell by about 10%, Yonggong rose by less than 10%. Outside the market, all old stocks, except for Dasheng which rose slightly, retreated slightly.

Zhongfang Increases Capital

The Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a notice yesterday stating: "According to Zhongfang Yarn Textile Co., Ltd.'s letter dated July 7th of this year, our company, in accordance with the regulations on re-evaluating fixed assets value and adjusting capital for industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, has resolved at the extraordinary shareholders' meeting on June 30th to increase capital by 7.128 billion National Currency, quickly synthesizing 7.425 billion. It is now scheduled from July 10th to the 16th to handle capital increase and distribution periods. The company will begin handling capital increase procedures, and its stock will be suspended from trading starting on July 10th (Thursday). This is hereby announced."

### Public Bonds and Foreign Stocks Both Decline

Public bonds saw renewed weakness yesterday. Tong Bing opened at 7,600 yuan, with a high of 7,700 yuan, but gradually fell to a low of 7,100 yuan at the close. Industry insiders from Room 503 and Room 551 were net buyers, while Room 360 and Room 230 were net sellers. Compared to the previous close, Class A and B bonds each fell by 300 yuan, Tong Bing fell by 500 yuan, and Class D and E bonds each fell by 200 yuan, with about 1 million in transactions.

Except for British-American Tobacco, foreign stocks generally declined yesterday. Securities firms, banks, and Hong Kong firms were net buyers, while insurers sold off more. Ewo Yarns opened at 84,500 yuan and gradually fell to a low of 81,000 yuan at the close, while British-American Tobacco remained stable due to absorption by Li'an Yanghang and others. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Hong Kong Shipping, Land Investment, and Development declined. Ewo Yarns, Paper, Brewery, Steel, and Telephone each fell by about 0.5%, while British-American Tobacco rose slightly.

### Spot Cotton Market Stable

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw cotton yarn decline slightly, but customers still raised prices, and sentiment remained firm. Credit conditions in the industry remained loose, so buying sentiment was strong. Yarn factories still had large appetites, and floating sellers in the market offered goods, with scattered buyers making up for it, resulting in a balanced supply and demand situation and stable prices. According to various firms, prices for delivery to the factory were: Lingbao 2.05 million, Laohekou 2.05 million, Shashi 1.96 million. Prices for delivery to the warehouse were: Lingbao (special grade) 2.20 million, also 2.00 million, 1.98 million, American Midling 2.05 million, Shashi 1.895 million, 1.86 million, Chongsha 1.96 million, Sanyuzhen 1.74 million, Tongzhou 1.75 million, Laohekou 1.895 million, Taicang 1.59 million, Huoji 1.60 million, Zhoupu seed cotton (genuine) 320,000 per unit.

### Abundant Rice Arrivals, Market Conditions Continue Downward

Yesterday, a total of more than 7,100 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Rice from Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Anhui arrived, and rice from Hunan also arrived in Shanghai. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has reopened, and Xian rice from Wenzhou and Taizhou has also arrived in Shanghai. Only a small amount of Taiwan rice has arrived. Market conditions continue to be downward, with supply exceeding demand, making optimism difficult. The earliest 60 Zi new Xian rice will soon be replaced by new crops. Sales in the market remain sluggish. Both Japonica rice and Xian rice fell by 10,000 yuan, and medium- and low-grade rice fell by another 13,000-14,000 yuan, with few buyers. White Yin Yuan also saw continued declines of 10,000 yuan.

Flour sales are remarkably weak, and the trend remains soft, hovering weakly. Bran sales have turned dull, falling by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Bean cake sales are sluggish and unenthusiastic, and the situation is fixed. However, Yingkou cake and Shantou transactions continue, advancing by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Soybean arrivals and sales are both active, maintaining a firm situation. Mung beans from South China are being carefully picked at high prices, continuing to be raised repeatedly, while medium- and low-grade beans have fallen by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Red beans are dull and lack vitality, in a weary state. Broad beans are flat and weak, red sorghum is depressed, corn has fallen by 2,000-3,000 yuan, sesame arrivals and stocks are both low, foreign firms are searching for supplies, making it a rare commodity, and prices are rising gradually, soaring by 10,000-20,000 yuan.

Shelled peanuts are selling briskly, with Southeast Asia buying heavily, rising steadily, breaking through the 500,000 mark, rising by 10,000-20,000 yuan. Wheat transactions are only sporadic, showing a weary and weak trend, falling by 3,000-5,000 yuan. The oil market has strong buying appetite from Hong Kong firms, buying sentiment is very strong, continuing to rise by 20,000-30,000 yuan. Small-cart sesame oil transactions have exceeded the 1 million mark.

### More Compensation Materials from Japan Should Be Allocated to Sichuan Province

Sichuan industry and commerce giants Liu Hangchen, Deng Huamin, Pan Changyou, Hu Ziang, Tang Yunhong, Mei Xinru, Zhang Shulin, and others, believing that more of the compensation materials from Japan should be allocated to Sichuan for construction, have telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Sichuan Provincial Government, and the delegation to Japan to express their opinions. It is learned that Vice Premier Wang Ai Wu, Sichuan Chairman Deng Xihou, and Chamber of Commerce Head Zhen all replied yesterday, and people from the province in Shanghai will hold a second meeting tomorrow (the 9th) to express their views.

### Continuing the Previous Day's Rising Momentum, Minor Fluctuations in Rayon, Factory-Spun Prices Firm, Silk Goods Rise Again

Yesterday, the rayon market saw an uneven trend in the morning. No. 120 Gaoshan Youguang opened at 30.66 million yuan, even reaching a high of 1.5 million yuan, but due to the excessively high price, few people inquired, and it fell slightly. The noon close was 1 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to rumors that a large amount of rayon would arrive in port, silk factory firms were mostly watching, sentiment softened slightly, and prices retreated again. The lowest bid was 30.2 million yuan, and the final bid was 30.5 million yuan, ending flat with the previous day's price. Other brands of goods all rose and fell accordingly, with no changes compared to the previous day's prices.

Yesterday, the factory-spun market was firm. High uniformity ABC grade prices were slightly higher than the previous day due to the scarcity of goods, with no transactions. D and E grade transaction prices were similar to the previous day. Medium grades saw slightly larger bids, ranging from 31.5 million yuan to 2 million yuan, with more than ten loads traded yesterday. High-grade separate load D-grade goods still traded at the original price from the previous day, and dry-spun separate loads also saw no changes in price.

Yesterday, silk goods rose again due to cost factors, especially quilt covers. Meiya quilt cover warehouse receipts were very scarce in the market, with no transactions yesterday, and the asking price was 4 million yuan. Dacheng quilt covers opened at a maximum of 3.35 million yuan, then bid at 300,000 yuan. Huaqiang quilt covers saw a maximum transaction of 250,000 yuan, then traded at 200,000 yuan, an increase of 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Dacheng checkered Bizon, after multiple boosts at the opening, was bid at 43,000 yuan, but due to more sellers than buyers, it ultimately collapsed, falling steadily. The final spot price was 1,800 yuan, and the next-day price was 2,100 yuan, a large increase of 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Hua Jin crepe prices were still bid at 28,000 yuan, but there was a lack of supply. Other goods were all slightly firmer.

Railway Equipment Shipped from the United States to Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] The Flying Eagle Entrepilis, managed by the Fulai Shipping Company, arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday, transporting a large batch of railway equipment and industrial machinery, as well as medical equipment, etc. This included four train carriages purchased by the Jiangnan Railway Bureau, a crane (capable of lifting 50 tons of goods), totaling 123 tons.

Also, there were 1,300 tons of medical equipment, ironware, and sundries, which were also goods from UNRRA.

### Cotton Yarn Market Prices Fall

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was initially firm, with 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn once reaching 30.2 million yuan. However, as credit tightened, and with long telegrams from Hong Kong, yarn factories sold off, and bulls closed out their positions at high prices, causing prices to fall. The final price was 19.8 million yuan, a decrease of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 22 Special Shuangma also fell by 600,000 yuan to 11.8 million yuan, while Shuangma yarn fell by 200,000 yuan to 10.7 million yuan. The overall trend, except for 40-count and 32-count fine yarns and 20-count specialty yarns, which rose by 100,000-200,000 yuan, saw consistent declines of 100,000-200,000 yuan for other 10-count, 16-count, 20-count, 32-count Silver Moon, and 42-count Shiguang and other fine yarns.

### Textile Adjustment Subcommittee, Opinions of Private Factories Gradually Converge

[Report from this newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened joint meetings of the Finished Product Transportation and Pricing Subcommittees starting at 10:00 AM yesterday. It also convened a Raw Material Supply Subcommittee meeting at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. According to Yuan Zhongda, the Secretary-General of the committee, the meetings have yielded some conclusions. The opinions of the private factories and Chairman Zou are gradually converging. The Fourth Committee meeting will be convened again at 9:30 AM today to discuss the cases submitted by the various subcommittees. Liu Siying, the acting Vice Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to participate in the meeting.

### Bituminous Coal Sales Gradually Increase

The coal market sees a dull trend for coal briquettes due to the impact of coking coal dumping, and prices continue to hover. Bituminous coal sales, however, are gradually becoming active, and market prices are also firm. Especially bituminous coal briquettes, the market is seeing a shortage of supply, and market sentiment is the strongest. Due to transportation costs, the Shanghai delivery price of Yuanhua coal dross is rumored to be adjusted, so there are not many supplies recently, and market sentiment is quite good. Coal briquette factories are also following closely. Fortunately, retail sales in coal shops are not smooth, making it difficult to see immediate gains and losses.

### Strong Buying Sentiment, Cigarettes Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, the cigarette market was soaring, due to the impending adjustment of cigarette tax rates. Yongtaihe's delay in distributing goods to other regions further contributed to the rise. Zhonghua cigarettes finally continued to rise by 240,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Old knives also rose to 7.15 million yuan, Wuhua rose by 330,000 yuan to 6.28 million yuan. Hademen was 5.75 million yuan. Higher-grade cigarettes from Yizhong Company, such as Dabao, Weida, Sanpao, and Qianmen brand carton cigarettes, rose by 1,000 to 3,400 yuan. The prices of Chinese-made cigarettes such as Meili, Golden Mouse, Bank, Baishi, Landikeleisi, etc., also uniformly rose by 500 to 2,500 yuan. American goods such as Camel, Lucky Strike, and Morris carton cigarettes, and 50-piece canned cigarettes, also rose by 1,000-2,000 yuan.

### Export Green Tea Robust

Export green teas such as Zhengzhen Zhenmei have been sluggish for a long time due to the lack of buyers from Zhangzhou. Recently, as some exporters are resuming quality checks, sentiment has been repeatedly firming, and sellers are showing intentions of selling at higher prices. As a result, although there were no actual transactions in the market yesterday, the process was tighter than the previous day. As for domestic tea, Tuoping is still not stagnant, and prices continue to show a good trend. Other Hong Kong firms are eager to purchase Shanghai White Chrysanthemum, but as the sellers are hesitant, there are no transactions. However, the situation is like adding wings to a tiger, becoming even better, and the future is promising.

### Export Committee Passes Resolution to Purchase Exported Frozen Eggs

[Report from this newspaper] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a regular meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. After discussion, it was resolved to authorize the China Trust Bureau to purchase the third batch of exported frozen eggs, totaling 250 tons, at a price of 20 million yuan per ton.

[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the China Trust Bureau and the members of the Shanghai Frozen Egg Industry Association have completed the sales of three batches of exported frozen eggs. The first batch of 175 tons was traded at a price of 9-9.9 million yuan per ton. The second batch of 796 tons was traded at a price of 9.9-18 million yuan per ton. These two batches of frozen eggs were loaded onto ships for England in mid-June and on the 4th of this month. The third batch of 250 tons, which was passed by the Export Committee yesterday, is still awaiting purchasing procedures.

### Import Management Committee Simplifies Application Procedures and Standardizes Visa Exchange Procedures Nationwide

[Report from this newspaper] The 38th Executive Committee meeting of the Import Management Committee was held at the Central Bank starting at 3:00 PM yesterday. After discussion, several important cases were passed. A preliminary report is given here: (1) Simplified application procedures, and (2) Detailed regulations on standardizing and rectifying visa exchange procedures for offices in various regions across the country are as follows:

(1) Simplified application procedures: Effective July 16th, the original general application form for import and the form for the permit will be cancelled and replaced with a "Permit Application" form. The new form (which will be printed by the 10th of this month and supplied by designated banks) should be filled out in five copies by the applicant and submitted to any designated bank. After the bank conducts a preliminary review and classification, the Permit Application for Class I and Class III A in the appendix will be sent directly to the Non-Quota Review Office, and the Permit Application for Class II in the appendix will be sent directly to the Quota Allocation Office. Except for unqualified Permit Applications, which should be returned to the designated banks and notified to the applicant, the remaining Permit Applications will be approved by the Allocation Office or the Non-Quota Office. The fourth and fifth copies of the Permit Application will be retained for record, and the first, second, and third copies will be sent directly to the Imported Goods Management Office for countersigning. The third copy will be filed for record, the first copy will be given to the applicant for customs clearance, and the second copy will be given to the designated bank for foreign exchange settlement.

(2) The Import Management Committee has adopted a national standardized policy to rectify the visa exchange procedures for offices in various regions. The authority and procedures for Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Xiamen have been clearly defined and implemented since July 1st. All temporary permits previously issued by Guangzhou and Kowloon will be suspended. The special situation in South China, which has been brewing for half a year, can now be controlled. A preliminary report on the standardized measures is as follows:

(1) Appendix 1, Class I Goods: The standardized measures for each region stipulate that the Non-Quota Office will allocate a portion of the foreign exchange within its quota each month for each region to handle the quota for Appendix 1, Class I goods. Starting in July, the offices in each region will issue the Permit Application for these goods and report it weekly to the Non-Quota Office and the Secretariat.

(2) Appendix 2, Class II Goods: (Goods under national control, such as gasoline, cotton, wool, rubber, burlap bags, corduroy thread, rayon, newsprint, pulp, and food and white coal under government control, are excluded).

### A Loyal Soul Demands Justice from the Traitorous Devil; Violent Rain Mingles with Filth

— Nanjing, 5th Dispatch by Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua of This Newspaper – Ding's Recantation of Fu Mocun's Punishment

The murderous demon king, Ding Mocun, was too ferocious, too cruel. His sins were countless, his evil deeds numerous. Today, he was executed before a million citizens of the capital. Although everyone applauded, we feel that his dog's life should not have been prolonged until today. The authorities' delayed review inevitably caused disappointment. Look! How many compatriots were watching, how many compatriots were crying, and how many more were seeking retribution for blood debts, time after time, resistance after resistance. They were waiting anxiously. Now, in the afterlife, the loyal souls, perhaps, are settling accounts with Ding Xiancun. Zheng Pingru, whom he first violated and then murdered, is naturally his most formidable adversary.

"Number One" in the Heavens; Old Debts Settled

The name of Ding Mocun inevitably brings to mind the beginning and end of Ding's betrayal and harm to the people, as well as his stubbornness during the public trial. His treacherous face made it clear at a glance that he was a "murderous demon king"! Before the War of Resistance and until his betrayal, he held important responsibilities within the central government. Before the division of "Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (CC Bureau)" and "Military Bureau of Investigation and Statistics (Military Bureau)," he was the Director of the Third Division of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics. He was fully aware of the country's secrets, military deployments, and our intelligence organizations. The central government at that time placed great importance on him. As late as the thirtieth year of the Republic, he was still a Major General Senior Advisor to the Military Affairs Commission. Unexpectedly, he transformed himself and followed Wang Jingwei in betraying the party and the country. Wang Jingwei used his past working relationships to re-employ him and entrust him with the important task of "puppet secret agent." Using a "key figure" who understood the country's internal affairs and knew the deployment of the intelligence organization to carry out work against the country and the government was naturally particularly convenient. In the thirty-second year, our central government's intelligence organizations in enemy-occupied territories were repeatedly uncovered by the enemy and puppets, and many of our underground comrades in the occupied areas were tortured by "He's special agents." These were all the monstrous crimes of Ding Mocun in harming the country and the people. Ding Mocun was indeed the "Number One" wanted criminal, far exceeding the bookish chief traitors Chen Gongbo, Si Ping, and Lin Baisheng by ten thousand times. He should be dismembered into a thousand pieces to appease the hearts of our people!

Horrifyingly Absurd "Bold Statements" in Prison

During several trials, he consistently quibbled, either claiming to be under the surveillance of the enemy puppets or shifting the responsibility onto Li Shiqun, whitewashing the sins of the "76th Headquarters" den of devils. These were just the typical arguments of a traitor. The most detestable thing was the absurd argument he made in the second trial, saying: "Please look at northern Jiangsu! Such a chaotic situation is a thousand times worse than Zhejiang. Zhejiang was able to lay the foundation for peace and security under my control. Why has northern Jiangsu become irreparable today? The reason is that it lacked a Ding Mocun." Reading the above absurd statement, one can see how arrogant and invincible he was in those days. I remember that in early February, when I braved the snow to visit Ding Mocun in the Tiger Bridge Prison, it was one of the most profound impressions I had. I asked him if he had any thoughts or reflections in prison. He said: "Ren Yuandao, Zhang Lanfeng... were all under my command in the past. They are opportunists with military power, so they are still officials now. I am now a character who has lost his gambling capital, so what else is there to say?" Thinking about it, if Ding Mocun had not surrendered, he would have inevitably fallen into the embrace of the Communist Party and harmed the country and the people again, which is beyond doubt.

The Capital High Court sentenced him to death on February 8, which was perfectly justified and not at all unjust. What face did he have to appeal? On May 1, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence, but Ding still refused to accept it. On May 14 and May 27, he applied for a retrial twice more. The Supreme Court rejected the last two appeals on May 23 and June 11, and rejected them again on June 24 and July 4. His fate was sealed from then on. Like a thunderclap, Execution Order No. 2039 of the Judicial Administration Department was finally delivered to the High Court by the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court at 11:00 AM on the 5th. The High Prosecutor's Office immediately dispatched Prosecutor Chen Shengzu as the supervising officer to carry out the execution.

Both Divine and Human Wrath: "Nothing to Say"

At 12:00 PM, this reporter was the first to receive the news and drove to the Tiger Bridge Capital Prison in 25 minutes. At that time, no one in the prison knew about it yet, so I sat and waited in the reception room to the right of the prison gate. Afterwards, reporters from various newspapers rushed to the scene, numbering more than 40 people. At 1:20 PM, the sky changed, dark clouds gathered, and the weather turned from hot to cool. At 1:40 PM, Prosecutor Chen Shengzu, accompanied by the court clerk and bailiffs, arrived in a small jeep and drove into the courtyard, then closed the gate and imposed strict security. After Prosecutor Chen arrived, Warden Kong accompanied him to inspect the execution ground. At that time, the sky became even darker, and thunder rumbled incessantly outside the window. Both divine and human wrath were aroused; everyone watched closely the end of this great traitor.

When the prosecutor announced the execution order, Ding trembled. "Do you have a will?" the prosecutor asked him. "It's too late to write a will, but I don't know if any of my family members have come?" As he spoke, he still looked around with his lifeless eyes, and when he found no family members, he continued, "I have nothing to say about my family, but if my family has financial difficulties in the future, I can only let them go..."

Then the judge told him that the law had a reasonable solution for the family and would reserve a reasonable living allowance. Then he said, "Do you have anything else to say?" "I won't talk about my personal affairs, but I don't know if the country can be more lenient towards a group of traitor cases. I hope to give them a chance to be lenient." His voice trembled a little. After he finished speaking, he smiled sinisterly. Prosecutor Chen immediately rebuked him, saying: "The area of France is not as large as one province of Sichuan in our country, and it has handled as many as 80,000 cases of traitors, of which 7,000 were sentenced to death. Our country has only executed a few major traitors so far, which cannot be praised as being lenient." Then he asked again if there were any last words. Ding thought for a moment and replied, "Nothing to say."

The prosecutor asked him three times, and he had nothing to say. In fact, from his pale face and hurried breathing, it could be seen that he had thousands of words to say, but his panicked expression prevented him from saying a word. He could only force a bitter smile and勉强 said, "Nothing to say."

To the "Underworld"; The Great Traitor's Career Concludes

At this point, Prosecutor Chen signed the execution order and ordered the bailiffs to escort Ding out. Ding was already panicked in the midst of the bailiffs' shouts, but he still pretended to be a "hero" and walked to the execution ground on his own. After about ten steps, he was stopped three times by Chief Executioner Zhu Kunfeng before he stopped. Just as Ding was about to look back, Chief Zhu aimed a Browning pistol at the back of his head and fired a shot. Ding immediately fell to the ground, his body lying on its right side, curled up into a bow shape, his hands crossed in front of his chest. The bullet passed through his forehead and right eyebrow, and his face and pants were stained with blood. A minute later, his limbs twitched incessantly, just like the scene when chickens and ducks are slaughtered. At that time, the executioner wanted to fire another shot, but the supervising officer persuaded him to stop. Then the bailiffs straightened his two legs and laid the body face up, and he finally died at 2:19 PM. Ding used to boast in court that he was an "underground worker." At this point, the career of the great traitor ended in the "underworld," which can be said to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, and everyone applauded!

### The Movement and Stillness of Qingdao

— Qingdao Air Dispatch, 2nd. Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Hui Cheng

Every year in July and August, Qingdao experiences fog, which enters the land from the sea for forty or fifty miles. The wind cannot disperse it, and the stronger the wind, the denser the fog, which is very unusual. This is because in July and August, a warm current comes from the Southeast Sea, which meets the cold current coming from the Korean Strait in this area, thus forming fog. This is a special situation. According to the Meteorological Observatory's prediction: there will be three weeks in early July with visibility between fifty and two hundred meters. Today, the Meteorological Observatory issued a signal stating that at 2:00 AM this morning, a cyclone was stagnant or slowly moving at 40 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees east longitude. This location should be near Beiping. Here, a force 4 wind is blowing, the sky is cloudy, and there is fog. Therefore, it is feared that the weather will not clear up in the near future.

Opening of the Seaside Bathing Beach

The seaside bathing beach was opened on the 1st. Due to repairs, the opening date was postponed from the middle of last month to early July. This is an annual event. This summer is late, and the hottest days have reached about 80 degrees, but today it is only 68 degrees. Therefore, although the bathing beach is open, there are very few swimmers. It is expected that the bathing beach will be lively at the end of July and throughout August. In the past, every summer, people from afar often chose to spend the summer here because of the seaside bathing beach, abandoning Mogan Mountain, Gulangyu, or Beidaihe and taking Qingdao instead. The facilities of Qingdao's seaside bathing beach are so good that, considering only the coastlines of North China, it can be said to be second to none.

The First Seaside Bathing Beach, namely Huiquan Bathing Beach, is located in Huiquan Bay in the eastern part of the city. There are no hidden reefs, no whirlpools, and no raging waves. The area is wide and the sand is flat, and the waves gently roll onto the sand, making it an ideal place for sea bathing and swimming. The facilities are also the best among all bathing beaches. Whoever praises Qingdao's seaside bathing beach should take this as a representative. The facilities include yachts, diving platforms, floating platforms, docks, surfboards, life rings, and tap water showers. The gaps in the fences are filled with flowers and trees, as well as children's playgrounds. Dressing rooms and bathhouses are lined up, and their architecture is extremely competitive and colorful, adding to the charm. The Second Seaside Bathing Beach is located on Shanhai Pass Road, on the north bank of Taiping Bay in the southeast of the city. The area is connected to Taiping Bay Park on the shore and can accommodate 180 bathrooms, making it a scenic spot for sea bathing. The Third Bathing Beach is in Taipingjiao, which is smaller in scale and has some floral facilities. The Fourth Bathing Beach is located in the southern part of the city, in the east, south of Zhanshan Village. The area is also inhabited by summer vacationers, so a bathing beach was specially built. The Fifth Bathing Beach is located on Xinjiang Road, which is isolated in the northwest of the city, near the harbor and north of Xiaogang. The Sixth Bathing Beach is located south of Taiping Road, west of Zhanqiao Pier. There used to be bathhouses there, but they have been destroyed. There are hidden reefs at both ends of the bathing beach. The Seventh Bathing Beach is on Yanerdao Island. The place is not an isolated island in the water, but a protruding area. The Youth Association's youth camp building and the police station's pigeon mail are located there. In summer, it is a bathing beach, and in autumn, it is a great place to watch the tides.

The ones that have just been opened are the First, Second, and Sixth places. The Third, Fourth, and Sixth are exclusively used by the US military and managed by the US side. This annual event, even in these days of war and chaos, the seaside scenery should still be as good as in the past.

Strange Tale of Yellow Explosives

A few months ago, the security authorities here arrested a merchant and intercepted the goods he was transporting. The boxes were printed with the words "Cao Da." When the powder was tested, it could aid combustion, and when thrown into water, it produced bubbles. When tested with an extinguished match, it could be re-ignited, and it was slightly explosive. Therefore, it was considered to be explosives, and the merchant was detained and suffered hardship. The merchant was transporting goods to Weixian County, so he was not without suspicion. Although he claimed that it was an industrial raw material, there was nothing he could do. Later, the chemicals were handed over to professors at Shandong University for testing, and it was found to be sodium peroxide (Na2O2).

Recently, there has been news that yellow explosives will destroy Qingdao. The rumors spread, and those who spoke did not verify, and those who listened did not investigate, thus becoming a strange tale. First of all, a month ago, the Bureau of Enemy and Puppet Property Disposal auctioned off a batch of materials, which were yellow fragments, as dyes. This was determined by the customs and the China Textile Company. Subsequently, dye merchants Wang Xinpu, Hao Zan, and others jointly purchased them, totaling 2,900 catties, worth 6.38 million yuan. The merchants believed that it was indirect dye naphthol, but they did not know whether it was α or β naphthol. However, it was indeed effective for dyeing yellow khaki. This substance can burn, because most dyes can burn, and it can also explode. This was discovered by the detective team, who brought Wang Xinpu and others to the team for questioning before learning the whole story. According to the team, it was proven by the Luo's Chemical Testing Institute that this substance was indeed TNT. Therefore, 2,900 catties of drugs were extracted and temporarily managed by the police station. However, the customs inspection of the dye raised the question of what its basis was. Moreover, several chemical technicians were quite surprised. At this point, the news that yellow explosives were about to destroy Qingdao had spread. Even if we retreat ten thousand steps, if this were pure yellow explosives, its weight would be less than one and a half tons, which could only blow up a few houses, and it would be impossible to destroy Qingdao. The authorities are paying close attention to this kind of sensational rumor.

In fact, chemical experts here are paying close attention. According to a professor at Shandong University, with the equipment currently known in Qingdao, it is difficult to be sure about the chemical testing of such organic matter, unless it is handed over to the Central Research Institute, whose equipment should be able to determine what it is. As for observing its color, it does not seem like the so-called naphthol, because naphthol is white. If it is said to be TNT, it does not seem like it either. Chemical testing is currently being attempted.

Although the matter is a strange tale, it involves many aspects, and the enlightenment and lessons it gives us are profound.

Serious Refugee Problem

Qingdao is like an isolated island, with no land transportation to the outside world except by sea. Recently, the China National Aviation Corporation stated that since the Jiaoji Railway was cut off last time, more than 3,000 merchants from Jinan were stranded here, and more than 500 people went to register for a flight. This time, a plane was specially allocated to transport them. After the transportation is completed, the plane will leave Qingdao. Therefore, it is impossible for outsiders to fly to Jinan in a short time, because it is not a scheduled flight.

There are approximately 170,000 refugees here, which is an estimated figure, but it is also close. There are also 10,000 exiled students. When Qingdao was taken over, there were originally many empty enemy properties, and as refugees poured in, various places became overcrowded. Today, it is quite difficult to rent a spare house in Qingdao. The Shandong-Qingdao branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has ended, and the 40,000 people who had previously received assistance have also run out of food, creating a problem. Almost nothing can be done. Various parties have organized a temporary relief association, but words are more than deeds, and it is difficult to cook without rice. It was decided to organize a delegation to Beijing to seek help from the central government, and the municipal government filled 30 million yuan as travel expenses. They requested the central government to allocate funds and food, declaring that they would not return to Qingdao unless they achieved their goals. They also asked Mayor Li Xianliang to take the lead and go to Beijing first to state the local situation. Officials and people worked together to strive for support from the central government. When the weather clears up, they will set off immediately. More than 100,000 starving refugees are hoping that this will lead to a concrete solution. It was previously reported that the central government asked Guangdong Province whether the refugees here could be settled in Hainan Island. This place did not know about it beforehand, but this proves that after the local situation was reported to the central government, the central government was clearly very concerned and was looking for concrete solutions.

At present, the first step is to focus on evacuation, but Qingdao is an isolated island, and 90,000 people have already accepted concrete arrangements, evacuating to the countryside and distributing them to the Baojia system for residence. Although the Shandong-Qingdao branch of the UNRRA is coming to an end, it has recently allocated 30 tons of miscellaneous grains to the evacuation areas, which will be distributed as soon as the refugees arrive. The Relief Association has agreed with the Garrison Command to form the 530 refugee men who were previously trained into a garrison battalion under the command of the Fortress Headquarters. At the same time, the Military Command Area is also continuing to allocate men to the training team for placement.

The Relief Association's cooperation with the refugees has gradually calmed the refugees' disturbances of the past few days. However, Qingdao is nervous, and any slight disturbance makes the general mood uneasy. How to stabilize it requires deep thought and careful planning.

### Taiwan's Largest Machinery Factory; Main Products: Engines, Fishing Boats

— Kaohsiung, July 30th, Air Dispatch. This Newspaper's Reporter, Yang Yu.

Accompanied by the progress of Taiwan's sugar industry, the Japanese established a "Kabushiki Gaisha Taiwan Ironworks" in Kaohsiung in November of the eighth year of the Republic. This was a private factory, but its internal machinery and equipment were top-notch. It undertook the important task of repairing and manufacturing machinery for sugar factories throughout Taiwan, and it performed well. When the Pacific War broke out, in coordination with the Japanese military's invasion frenzy, this ironworks was used as a place for carrying out the machinery industry and shipbuilding industry. Judging from the fact that it initially had 3,000 workers and more than 800 employees, it is not difficult to understand the scale and outline of this largest machinery factory in Taiwan.

New-style Lathes; Japanese Dumped Them into the Sea

Now this factory, along with the Keelung Shipyard, is under the Taiwan Machinery and Shipbuilding Company, and it has been renamed the Kaohsiung Machinery Factory to promote the nascent machinery and shipbuilding industry in Taiwan. In the past, it had such strong strength: its machine tools included 168 lathes, 56 drilling machines, 12 shapers, 14 planers, 32 milling machines, 11 boring machines, 37 grinding machines, and 109 other pieces of equipment, totaling 439 pieces. The shipbuilding department has one each of 60M×40M and 55M×25M docks, as well as 60M×25M and 60M×12 launch platforms. The iron smelting also has two 5-ton iron smelting furnaces, two 3-ton iron smelting furnaces, and one 1-ton electric steel-making furnace. The lifting and transport equipment includes eight 15-ton cranes, five 3-10 ton manual cranes, one 20-ton crane, and a railway that runs directly into the factory, providing a very convenient transportation network. After the bombing, the utilization rate of machine tools only reached about 35%, and many new-style grinding machines were even dismantled by the Japanese and dumped into the sea. However, the production capacity can currently simultaneously build two 170-ton wooden boats, repair one 7,000-ton and one 10,000-ton ship, and melt 100 tons of iron and 20 tons of steel per month.

Weak Purchasing Power; Capital Turnover is Not Flexible

According to Chief Bi of the factory, the current business focuses on manufacturing 115-horsepower and 200-horsepower diesel engines and building 65, 170, and 200-ton fishing boats, as well as repairing railway locomotives. Since the restoration, four 170-ton fishing boats have been completed one after another, but only three have been sold. Fishing Boat No. 4, owned by Taiwan, still has no buyer. A 200-ton fishing boat, including all equipment for engines and fishing gear, sold for 7 million New Taiwan dollars last year. A 65-ton boat sells for 850,000 yuan, and two have been sold to the Shanghai Engineering Company. Chief Bi said that this price cannot be considered expensive. As long as you catch a few fish, you can recover the capital. The reason why sales are not as ideal is still because the purchasing power of the private sector is too weak.

The reporter made a tour of the factory's machine shop, repair shop, electrical steel casting shop, and shipbuilding shop and found that the scope of adaptation of the machines here is extremely wide. It can handle most general casting, forging, machinery processing, and various machine tools with ease. However, because the capital turnover is not flexible, it is difficult for the business to have a high degree of development. Customers do whatever they need, so it is inevitable that the efficiency of the excellent equipment here will be disappointed. The reporter also saw many lathes and drilling machines making irrelevant small parts. The machine factory's own depression lies here.

Promotional Organization; Striving to Seize the Market

Chief Bi also said that without a fixed budget, there is still no way even if the product is profitable. Moreover, apart from engines and fishing boats, there are few fixed products, so there are many inconveniences in terms of parts and work, and it is even more difficult to make money. He also agreed with the reporter's opinion that in order for the business to get on the right track, the promotion organization cannot be located inside the factory and must be located in Shanghai and other places. Seizing the market is to fight for the future of the factory.

Affected by the budget, raw materials have also become a problem. Pig iron, steel plates, round iron, and steel bars are only some of the remaining materials previously shipped from Japan and Northeast China. The total monthly usage is more than 20,000 kilograms. Whether the supply and demand can be smooth in the future depends on whether the factory's business can improve. As for other materials such as wood taken from Alishan, oil, oxygen, and calcium carbide are also supplied by this province, so it seems that there is no shortage at present.

When the reporter was about to say goodbye, Group Leader Xue casually talked about the situation of the more than 1,000 workers here. He said that the average salary is about 5,000 yuan, but the workers here have led several labor strikes in the area, perhaps because they have a higher level of knowledge. But if it is said to be for life, the treatment is already better than other factories. Therefore, personnel management is a very troublesome thing.

### Preferential Talk on Buying Old Ships and Expanding Tonnage

— Huang Zhendong

Maritime transport is the foundation of a nation. The rise and fall of national fortunes, the prosperity and decline of a nation's industry, commerce, culture, and economy, all depend on the development of its maritime transport industry. Our country's maritime transport industry is still in its infancy, and all facilities have lagged behind others. Before the war, our total tonnage was only over 500,000 tons (including Jardine Matheson, Taikoo Dockyard, and foreign tramp steamers, about 1 million tons, totaling 1.5 million tons). Moreover, due to the constraints of unequal treaties, our navigation rights were seized, causing us pain for decades! Now, after the war, Japan has been defeated, and the world has changed. Unequal treaties have been abolished, and our navigation rights have been recovered. This is truly a great opportunity for our country's maritime transport industry to revive, build, and become self-reliant. Before World War II, Japan's total merchant ship tonnage was 5.5 million tons. Currently, it has about 1.5 million tons. After the recovery, our country has suddenly increased from the remaining 100,000 tons to 800,000 tons, exceeding the pre-war tonnage, which is a good phenomenon. However, this meager amount is far behind the tonnage of various countries in the world. Not only has it not reached the level of advanced countries in the world, but it is also lacking compared to the defeated nation of Japan. If we further consider the necessary supporting facilities such as docks, warehouses, shipbuilding, and repairs, we are even further behind and unable to compete with them. This is truly a disgrace to our country's maritime transport industry. Given the length of our coastline and the vastness of our territory, once the political situation stabilizes and transportation recovers, the above-mentioned tonnage will be insufficient to supply inland and coastal shipping, let alone open up ocean routes and compete with the maritime transport industries of advanced nations.

What is even more regrettable is that our shipbuilding equipment is still in its infancy. There are only five relatively large shipyards: Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard, Qingdao Naval Shipyard, Fuzhou Mawei Shipyard, and two shipyards in Keelung and Kaohsiung. Even for the aforementioned shipyards, the longest dry dock is only 600 feet long, and the maximum tonnage it can accommodate is only 15,000 tons. With such equipment, it is already insufficient to handle ship repairs, let alone mass-produce new ships to meet demand, which is simply impossible.

Under such circumstances, in order to meet the urgent needs of shipping and seek tonnage expansion to adapt to this initial need, there is no other way but to purchase foreign ships from abroad. When evaluating foreign old ships for purchase, the age and draft should not be the only criteria. The quality of a ship should be valued over its appearance. The sturdiness of the hull and the excellent performance of the machinery should be the main considerations. It is a well-known fact that the quality and performance of new ships hastily built during wartime to meet urgent needs are often not as good as those of old ships. Therefore, when expanding tonnage, age should not be the sole criterion for selection.

In addition, we sincerely hope that our government will encourage shipping companies to purchase foreign ships, such as providing loans and ship mortgage facilities to shipping companies. For ships that are particularly needed in our country, especially those related to international trade, subsidies or long-term low-interest loans and preferential foreign exchange settlements should be provided. As tonnage is gradually expanded, we should strive to improve the quality and performance of ships and further strengthen shipbuilding equipment. Given time, our country's maritime transport industry will not only replace Japan's position but also compete with the maritime transport industries of advanced nations.

### A Rebellious Assault

— Zhao Qingge

With the feelings of Liu Bei visiting Zhuge Liang, Liao Dong found Li Hua's teacher and friend, Liu Ziyun, and told Liu Ziyun in detail about his meeting with Li Hua. He begged Liu Ziyun to come forward to salvage the stalemate, save Li Hua, and save him too!

Liu Ziyun understood this situation. She had received a letter from Li Hua, a letter appealing to her. She knew that Director Yang was pursuing Li Hua, and she also knew that Li Hua would never love Director Yang—a national traitor who relied on power to bully others, embezzled and engaged in malfeasance, and hoarded for profit, doing all kinds of evil. Li Hua loved Liao Dong—an aspiring youth, a hero. But even though Li Hua was like this, she knew even better that Li Hua's mother, Mrs. Mo, was not like this. Mrs. Mo did not understand the value of personality, but only worshiped money. Therefore, Mrs. Mo did not need to seek Li Hua's consent, but directly flattered Director Yang, flattering the god of wealth in her mind.

"The problem is not with Director Yang, but with Mrs. Mo. Mrs. Mo wants to recover the losses caused by the war from Director Yang, so she needs to use Li Hua to lure Director Yang, but she may not necessarily let Li Hua marry Director Yang. But Director Yang's money will not be spent in vain. Director Yang's purpose is to marry Li Hua. Mrs. Mo has not thought about these things. Li Hua has thought about them but can do nothing about Mrs. Mo, so Li Hua is in pain!" Liu Ziyun calmly analyzed the key to the problem, while thinking about ways to deal with the problem.

"The problem is already very serious. Allowing it to develop is really too dangerous, Mr. Liu! Please think of a way!"

"What did Li Hua say to you?" Liu Ziyun asked with concern.

"She just told me to save her, to ask you for advice. Therefore, I rushed here overnight. I hope you can help me," Liao Dong said hesitantly, still revealing a kind of shyness.

"I know Li Hua loves you very much," Liu Ziyun said calmly, "but Mrs. Mo may not necessarily love you, so first you must establish a good relationship with Mrs. Mo, so that she has a good impression of you, and then your problem with Li Hua can have further development."

"What if I propose to Li Hua now?"

"Li Hua cannot make the decision."

"Then I will ask Mrs. Mo to agree."

Liu Ziyun thought for a while, and then said to Liao Dong:

"Okay, tomorrow I will accompany you to Chongqing. Let me first explore Mrs. Mo's intentions, and then act accordingly. Now I will accompany you to see my friend, also Li Hua's friend, Mr. Dong Shaoling. He may have better ideas; and we will need his help in the future."

So, Liao Dong followed Liu Ziyun to visit Dong Shaoling. Liao Dong had met Dong Shaoling in Wuhan. After this in-depth conversation, their impressions of each other were very good. Liao Dong respected Dong Shaoling as a teacher, and Dong Shaoling also loved Liao Dong very much, just as Dong Shaoling encouraged Li Hua to wait patiently for Liao Dong. He also advised Liao Dong not to relax his pursuit of Li Hua. Dong Shaoling's idea was that as long as Li Hua was ambitious, she should not be afraid of Mrs. Mo's opposition; Dong Shaoling even suggested that Liao Dong should get engaged to Li Hua immediately. Of course, Li Hua must obtain Mrs. Mo's consent. If Mrs. Mo agreed, then that was that. If she did not agree, then a third party should come forward to mediate. Dong Shaoling's suggestion was exactly what Liao Dong wanted. Liu Ziyun felt that doing this was too uncertain, and it would be better to first establish a good relationship with Mrs. Mo and then slowly proceed. Liao Dong was impatient, and at the same time, because of the constraints of his work, he could not often approach Mrs. Mo, so he estimated that it would be difficult to have a connection. However, Dong Shaoling came up with a compromise method, which was to proceed on two fronts. On the one hand, Li Hua should express her feelings to Mrs. Mo clearly, and on the other hand, Liao Dong should try his best to ingratiate himself with Mrs. Mo and cater to her wishes.

Liao Dong was very grateful to Dong Shaoling for this enthusiastic instruction. The next day, Qingping hurriedly left Beibei with Liu Ziyun and arrived in Chongqing at noon. Liu Ziyun taught him to buy some gifts to give to Mrs. Mo, because Liu Ziyun knew that Mrs. Mo loved small bargains. Ingratiation must start with gifts. Sure enough, this time when he saw Mrs. Mo, she treated him much more warmly than last time and invited him to have dinner. During dinner, he expressed his love for Li Hua to Mrs. Mo in every possible way and explained his friendship with Li Hua's brother, Bao Ling. Now he was willing to replace Bao Ling in being filial to Mrs. Mo. He said very sincerely:

"Brother Bao Ling and I grew up together since childhood, and our relationship is as close as siblings. His mother is like my mother, and I happen to be a person without a mother, so I will definitely treat you as my own biological mother,"

"I dare not accept that, Mr. Liao!" Mrs. Mo said modestly.

At this time, Li Hua did not say a word. After dinner, she hurriedly went to the theater with her younger sister, Li Yun. Liao Dong sent them off, partly because he wanted to talk to Li Hua on the way, and partly to listen to Li Hua sing "Cosmic Peak" that night. After they left, only Liu Ziyun and Mrs. Mo were left. Liu Ziyun took the opportunity to conduct exploratory work with Mrs. Mo.

"Liao Dong is a very honest and ambitious young man," Liu Ziyun first praised Liao Dong. "He likes Xiao Hua very much, and Xiao Hua is not bad to him either. I think, since you are from the same hometown, and he and Bao Ling are good friends, why not become relatives? - What do you think, old lady?"

"You mean to be a matchmaker for Liao Dong and marry Xiao Hua to him?" Mrs. Mo asked with some surprise, staring at her eyes.

"It's not really being a matchmaker. Anyway, they have known each other for a long time. But I think they are quite suitable."

"Do you think Xiao Hua would be willing? You know her temper," Mrs. Mo asked again with a sly smile.

"Xiao Hua will definitely be willing. She expressed it to me and to Bao Ling a long time ago! Because she also feels that Liao Dong is a promising and promising young man, she is just embarrassed to say it to you," Liu Ziyun replied calmly.

Mrs. Mo was even more surprised and stunned. She was silent for a while, then said half-believingly:

"She would be willing to marry him?"

"Why not? She likes Liao Dong, and besides, she is old enough to get married,"

"That's not necessarily true. Xiao Hua is only twenty-eight years old," Mrs. Mo said with some dissatisfaction. "Nowadays is not like in the past. It's not too late for a girl to get married at thirty."

"Unless the girl herself is willing, otherwise, parents cannot force her to wait until thirty to get married," Liu Ziyun began to argue.

"I didn't force Xiao Hua to wait until thirty to get married. But I don't believe that she really likes Liao Dong."

"Why?"

"You forgot, so many rich and powerful people liked her in the past, and now there is Director Yang who is still infatuated with her, but she refuses to marry. Is she crazy, choosing and choosing and choosing a Liao Dong who has nothing? I don't believe it," Mrs. Mo said firmly.

"You don't understand Xiao Hua. What she dislikes most are those 'rich and powerful' people who treat women as toys and vases. What she wants to marry is a young man like Liao Dong who 'has nothing' but has passion and loyalty. You can ask her if you don't believe me. Because I know it very clearly, I dare to tell you this. Now, as long as you agree, there is definitely no problem with her,"

Mrs. Mo didn't expect that the problem was placed on her shoulders. She frowned and considered for a while, then answered Liu Ziyun very resolutely.

"I don't agree."

"What's the reason?" Liu Ziyun asked relentlessly.

"I don't like this person," Mrs. Mo said without hesitation.

"But, I said, Xiao Hua likes him. It's useless if you don't like him. Because this is Xiao Hua's personal lifelong matter," Liu Ziyun retorted firmly.

"For Xiao Hua's sake, she shouldn't marry someone like Liao Dong. First," Mrs. Mo pondered for a moment and said, "Liao Dong can't support Xiao Hua. Second, Liao Dong is an air force pilot. He doesn't know if he will be alive tomorrow; therefore, I can't let Xiao Hua take this risk. Besides, it's not time for her to retire yet. Her art is important. Since I am her mother, I can make half of her decisions." Mrs. Mo was a little angry in the end!

"Your reasons are not valid, Aunt! You only see that Liao Dong doesn't have money now, but you don't see that Liao Dong is a promising young man, and his future is very bright. As for your concern that the air force is dangerous, but in wartime, even if he is not an air force pilot, life is just as dangerous. Have you forgotten that Bao Ling died in a bombing? On the contrary, air force pilots are safer as long as they have good skills and rich experience. Speaking of Xiao Hua's art, she doesn't necessarily have to retire after getting married; Liao Dong is also a person who loves art, and he will not interfere with Xiao Hua's singing. It's just that Xiao Hua herself is already tired of it. Therefore, I advise you to make it a success for them. If you don't want them to get married immediately, it's the same if you let them get engaged first."

Liu Ziyun's words had already aroused Mrs. Mo's resentment. Like five or six years ago in Kaifeng, she felt that Liu Ziyun was again there engaging in teaching Xiao Hua to betray her. Therefore, she really wanted to contradict Liu Ziyun a few words, but she didn't dare; what she was afraid of was not Liu Ziyun, but Li Hua. She knew Li Hua's temper. Making her angry would make things worse. These days, Li Hua had already quarreled with her several times over the problem of Director Yang.

"I think, this matter doesn't need to be too urgent. Let them get to know each other more. As long as Xiao Hua is willing, I, as a mother, can't control much," Mrs. Mo suppressed her dissatisfaction and reluctantly perfunctorily said.

"But as far as I know, they already have a very deep understanding and a very good relationship. Since you don't hold on to preconceived notions, it's just a matter of time, then it's still my original meaning, let them get engaged first," Liu Ziyun said, seeing that Mrs. Mo had already made concessions, and then pressed closer.

"It's not that easy, Mr. Liu!" Mrs. Mo finally blocked Liu Ziyun's mouth, not allowing Liu Ziyun to continue.

At night, when Li Hua came back after singing, Liu Ziyun told Feng Hua about her conversation with Mrs. Mo, asking Li Hua to express her feelings to Mrs. Mo directly again, at least forcing Mrs. Mo to agree to the engagement. Li Luo felt very sad after listening to Liu Ziyun's words, knowing that this was no different from her life and death juncture, so she quietly decided to have a most courageous fight with fate.

The next day, Li Hua was just about to prepare to talk to Mrs. Mo about the problem when Director Yang happened to come. Li Hua quickly hid. In the inner room, Li Hua eavesdropped on Director Yang enticing Ms. Tai to marry Li Hua to him. He said that his ex-wife had died for more than a year and he had not remarried because his conditions were very high, and it was not easy to find a suitable one. Now that he had fallen in love with Li Hua, he was willing to marry Li Hua and was responsible for Ms. Mo's life, and everyone could live together, and he could treat Ms. Mo as his own mother and be filial to her. He also talked about his real estate in Sichuan, hundreds of acres of land in Chengdu, a villa in Huangshan on the South Bank, and two houses in Chongqing. There are also commercial shareholders, bank loans, etc. A series of sweet words made Ms. Mo covetous, but she could not make a decision like selling goods and immediately agree to marry Li Hua to him. At the same time, she really couldn't bear to refuse such a good opportunity. It would have been fine without Liao Dong's interjection yesterday, but with Liao Dong's interjection, Ms. Mo had to seize this opportunity first. Because in this way, Director Yang could be used to deal with Liao Dong. So Ms. Tai told him that she was willing to take the lead in promoting this matter, but it still needed Li Hua's own consent. At this point, Li Hua rushed out like a whirlwind. Not knowing where the courage came from, she went straight to Ms. Mo.

"Mom, how can you say that!" Li Hua said sternly. Then she turned to Director Yang. "Director Yang, please don't believe her words. She can't make any decisions about my affairs. Although she is my mother, I have reached the legal age, and she has no right to interfere with my freedom. I have heard everything you just talked about. Now let me give you a solemn reply. That is absolutely impossible. So please don't waste your time."

"Why?" Director Yang couldn't help but ask in surprise.

"Because I already have someone I like, and I am going to get engaged to him," Li Hua said decisively.

"Xiao Hua!" Ms. Mo hurriedly shouted to stop her.

"Don't you believe me? Mom! Then, let me tell you again clearly, the person I love is Liao Dong, an air force pilot who has no money, no power, only passion, only loyalty. I am going to get engaged to him; because we are a combination of emotions, not a combination of trade. So there are absolutely no conditions between us," Li Hua said in one breath, finishing the words that had been suffocating in her heart for a long time.

"Okay!" After hearing Li Hua's words, Director Yang left, feeling angry and ashamed, without even saying goodbye.

With this, Ms. Mo was really anxious and hateful, and her face changed color. She almost raised her hand to hit Li Hua, rushed to her, and shouted loudly, trembling:

"I don't allow it, I don't allow you to want to marry whoever you want without regard to shame!"

"It's useless if you don't allow it, Mom! Liao Zhong and I already have a relationship, so I have to marry him."

"Xiao Hua!". Even Liu Ziyun, who had quietly walked in, shouted in surprise.

"Ah!". At the same time, Ms. Tai screamed and fainted to the ground.

Yes, no one thought that Li Hua would say such a thing, and even she herself didn't know what power made her so brave. She really blurted it out. Seeing Ms. Mo arbitrarily opposed her, she used such a reason that Ms. Mo despised to perfunctorily, and also cleared Liao Dong of responsibility. It was really too unbelievable. She finally made the most firm and resolute rebellious assault on Ms. Mo and on her own destiny!

### Ode to Yu Jianhua's Painting Exhibition

— Xu Shiqi

I have been separated from Jianhua for ten years. We met again at sea, and talked about the past as if it were yesterday; and Yu Zi's art has continued to improve. He has traveled to famous mountains and rivers in the universe, immersed himself in smoke and clouds, and his brush has participated in creation, almost breaking through the boundaries of the ancients and establishing a unique style. On the occasion of this solo exhibition, I write a sentence in response to his teachings:

Mount Tai and Mount Song Hua sing of majestic travels,

Thousands of rocks and ravines are collected in the car,

There is a misty atmosphere in the chest;

What else to seek from Dong Yuan and Juran, Jing Hao and Guan Tong?

Mosquitoes

On a hot day, the naked people slept very sweetly. Swarms of mosquitoes flew around their faces and bodies, buzzing and sucking their blood. Those sleeping people generally don't pay much attention to them.

——The "cultivation" of the Chinese people is really too great.

Similarly, great virtues are naturally not limited to the "mosquitoes" alone.

Maggots

It's the season for maggots to be active again.

It is true that maggots are disgusting things, but from this point of view, are human beings all respectable and lovable?

I'm afraid not ——

Maggots only rely on the waste excreted by human beings as their survival data, but certain higher animals are fattening their limbs in a pool of blood and sweat!

Flies

The fly is a hero, the reason is very simple—

It has the perseverance to fly back even when driven away.

It will buzz incessantly in the face of a dying warrior, and it has the courage to lick the flesh and blood of a dead warrior.

Its survival power is particularly strong, and tens of thousands of descendants can all survive in the muddy environment...

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 338

— Ye Jingfeng

When Mr. W heard me ask such a question, he immediately stopped, glanced at me, picked out a military map, spread it on his desk, and pointed it to me: "... This fur surface can be said to have five points of good fortune and five points of luck - this is not a bad sign, in the future, it will definitely defeat the dwarf devils -" Mr. Ding W was a little excited.

I moved my seat over to see where this five points of good fortune was.

"Probably the devils are superstitious about this 'eight', and they believe it to the extreme. On the one hand, they are joining in the fun, preparing to respond to the launch of 'the secret of eight', and on the other hand, they are following the original military plan, preparing to launch the northwest offensive on August 8 as the vanguard of the Zhengzhou Battle:"

"I am not a military strategist. Although I signed the Tanaka Memorial and heard Tsurumi talk about the Japanese army's invasion plan, the general idea is to 'fight quickly and decisively'. Since it is a quick and decisive battle, I just don't understand why they have to make such a big circle, detour to Taiyuan, Shanxi, to meet in Zhengzhou and Wuhan? Wouldn't it be easier to go directly south along the Pinghan Road?"

"No, marching cannot be greedy for convenience;" Mr. W put down the topic of "five points of good fortune," sat down on his solid seat on the spot, and stroked the map spread out with one hand, with the air of Zhuge Liang on the stage saying, "I have something to say, and you should listen to it:"

"Fighting along the communication line, the most fearful thing is the enemy's large army attacking from the side. Please think, although the army in Shanxi is a bit old, Liu Ruming's 29th Army is currently controlling the gateway to northern Shanxi, Tang Enbo's 13th Army is blocking the key northwest passes, and Chuan Zuoyang's iron cavalry is holding the important town of Sui Jin; and these three parties, as well as Elder Yan's other elite troops, are all waiting for mobilization. You think the Japanese devils also have quite sharp military eyes, can it be that he only cares about going south to meet and doesn't worry about these few large armies rushing out and cutting them into several sections? For this reason, he has to fight Shanxi first. The strategy of fighting Shanxi is clamping, on the one hand, slowly going south from Pinghan, on the other hand, the enemy troops going south from Pingsui and Zhangbei will meet in Datong, and then directly take Taiyuan, go down Tongguan, and meet in Zhengzhou with the Pinghan route. In this way, the main force going south has no worries." "... Moreover, there are Shanxi's resources..."

"The Japanese spies were desperately sneaking into Taiyuan and Datong batch by batch, and they were originally doing the paving work," I interjected, adding this sentence.

"It's not just paving the way. If we don't disturb them again from both sides, the main force of the Japanese army can simply enter directly without bloodshed and take half of the northwest with ease!" Mr. W sneered.

"Brother's 'five points of good fortune' refers to this?" I asked somewhat numbly.

### Dusk

— By Min Yangzhi

Dusk, the half-fallen setting sun, clings to the vast mountain peaks. Piles and piles of tangerine-red evening glow lightly smear the pale blue sky.

It is a summer dusk!…

Loneliness and emptiness, I have forgotten the seasons and time, buried the splendor of youth, and given a part of my life to the flowing light of the stars. It is as if in a snow-covered wilderness, death and coldness offer not a hint of warmth.

In the open space outside my home, many people sit in a circle, men and women, talking and laughing, adorning the boundless liveliness of the summer evening. The girls' thick black hair dances in the gentle breeze, and the young women's fair, tender arms and thighs are bathed in the golden light of the setting sun...

And so I began to be silent.

"To whom does this cool summer evening belong?"

Raising my head again in loneliness, the setting sun has already bid farewell to the mountains. A few pale yellow clouds float in the sky, and a falcon flies by, as if carrying a light silk, spreading its wings evenly and swiftly piercing the clouds.

And so I sigh at this distant world...

### Random Notes on Reading Poetry

— By Zhu Wen

Zuo Si's "Rhapsody on the Capital of Wu" says: "A giant tortoise supports the tablet, with cloud peaks crowning its head." Yuan Yi's poem: "Further crowning the peaks with its head," uses this event. According to Yang Shen's Outer Collection, the dragon has nine sons, each with its own preference. One, Bixi, likes to carry heavy objects, hence it is found under the base of steles today. However, Li Dongyang's "Huai Lutang Collection" and Shen Defu's "Wild Harvest Compilation" both state that the weight-bearer is named Baxia, while Bixi likes literature, hence it is the one winding around the stele. This is likely based on unfounded rumors, hence the inconsistent stories.

### Ten Thousand Yuan Disaster Relief Movement

— By Shi Lang

Guangdong and Guangxi are experiencing severe floods, Shanxi is experiencing drought, and in Chengdu, due to the flooding of the Jinjiang River, more than a thousand residents in the urban area have perished. The Chinese people are truly in a state of being boiled in water and scorched by fire. This metaphor, as it appears now, is not an exaggeration.

The floods in the disaster areas of Guangdong and Guangxi are widespread. The exact number of disaster victims is still unknown. Taking Guangxi Province as a whole, famine plus floods have resulted in over 1.5 million victims. The drought in Shanxi has affected as many as five million people.

Looking at the disasters in various places from the extravagant perspective of Shanghai, we truly feel indescribable shame! It is said that in the disaster areas of Guangxi, a small child is sold for only ten thousand yuan. Based on Shanghai's rice price of 500,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), this ten thousand yuan is only worth two sheng (a unit of volume) of rice, but in the disaster area, it can buy a life! On any given night, the amount spent in Shanghai's extravagant dance halls must be appalling. Hotels, dance halls, theaters—who is not indulging in extreme pleasure, who has ever even briefly considered that millions of our compatriots are struggling on the brink of death?

If we could, in these places, each person save ten thousand yuan to donate to the disaster victims in Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, and other places, what would it mean to us?

Therefore, I dare to appeal to all the people of Shanghai: let's start a ten thousand yuan disaster relief movement. We appeal to the clear-headed, conscientious men and women of Shanghai to voluntarily donate ten thousand yuan each to help our suffering compatriots!

### Stopping Bacterial Attacks—A New Drug for Tuberculosis

— By Ge Chunliang

Yesterday, I saw a news item in this newspaper about a new drug for treating tuberculosis, which said: "United Press International, Atlantic, 30th: Dr. Born reported at the American College of Chest Physicians that the latest "miracle drug" invention—Streptomycin—can treat two types of tuberculosis, namely military tuberculosis (?) and pediatric tuberculosis."

After reading it, I couldn't help but smile. In this world of "military first" (not safety first), the so-called military tuberculosis has actually appeared, which is ridiculous. It must be a translator's error.

The original text is Miliary Tuberculosis. The word Miliary is not Milityary, with a T in between. This word Miliary cannot be found in English-Chinese dictionaries. It comes from the Latin word Miliaris, which means millet seed, describing its small size and ability to form countless diseases. This type of TB, when spreading, can attack any organ in the body, even the membrane surrounding the brain.

The so-called Streptomycin is a miracle drug for treating tuberculosis. It has been tested with great success in the past two years. Hundreds of TB patients have been cured, and it has now begun to be sold in the United States.

Streptomycin is derived from the same component as penicillin, so it can be considered part of the penicillin family, but its composition is not as complex and regular as penicillin's.

Streptomycin is simply a "miracle drug" for treating ordinary tuberculosis. Within a few weeks, sometimes even a few days after starting treatment, the fever subsides, the cough stops, the appetite returns, and the patient begins to gain weight. Microscopic examination of his saliva shows that there are no TB bacteria. X-rays indicate that the TB spots in the lungs have disappeared.

According to a report from "Science Service," a 19-year-old girl developed severe TB that affected the lymph nodes in her neck. Within three months, the bacteria attacked the membrane around the girl's heart. In the past, very few people with such severe illnesses would survive, and complete recovery was simply impossible.

Five days after starting Streptomycin treatment, the high fever began to subside. According to her doctor, her symptoms had disappeared "completely and astonishingly." The bacteria that had been found in the fluid near her heart, in her blood, and in her lymph nodes had also disappeared. Five months later, the treatment was completed, and the girl returned home and recovered.

Here is another fact: Last October, a nursing school student contracted tuberculosis. She lost weight, often felt very tired, and began to cough. Every afternoon, her temperature increased.

In November, X-rays showed spots in her lungs. Although she rested in bed, her condition worsened. On December 16, X-rays showed that there was a hole in one of her lungs.

On December 17, Streptomycin treatment began. A month later, the nursing student was cured. The X-ray on January 21 of this year showed that there was no longer a hole in her lungs. The symptoms of TB bacteria were also gone, and she had recovered her health.

Another fact is that a 23-year-old man contracted tuberculosis. X-rays showed that there was a hole in his lung that was almost an inch in diameter.

The day after starting treatment with Streptomycin, six weeks later, the X-rays showed a completely different picture. The hole was gone, the fluid had almost completely disappeared, TB bacteria were no longer found in his body, and six months later, the report said—he was still improving—gradually resuming his daily activities.

For doctors, Streptomycin is not technically a "cure" for tuberculosis! It is a bacteria-stopping drug, or so-called bactericide. It stops the growth of bacteria, stops the bacteria from attacking the body, and gives the body a chance to recover.

Streptomycin is not completely effective. Sometimes, a patient's condition suddenly worsens during recovery. In this case, the bacteria begin to resist, and the drug is no longer effective.

This is what researchers of Streptomycin consider to be the biggest problem. This is the same problem that is encountered when using penicillin to treat tuberculosis. The medical community is experimenting with a new drug called Grisein, a drug closely related to Streptomycin. Doctors hope that when TB bacteria resist, another drug can enter and complete the "treatment" work. Whether it will succeed remains to be seen!

Although the literati of the Wei and Jin dynasties generally maintained a clear and beautiful style, careful study reveals that their actions can be divided into two factions: one faction saw through the changes of the world, spent their days in wine, medicine, mountains, and waters, indulging in unrestrained freedom, living a detached life; the other faction, however, hung up the sheep's head but sold dog meat, upholding the signboard of famous scholars, using it to form cliques, mutually promoting each other, as a stepping stone to advancement. Kong Rong is a representative of the latter faction.

As the Continued Book of the Later Han says: "Rong's arguments based on the classics were not as good as Rang and others, but his talent and erudition surpassed them." The so-called outstanding talent is just superficial talk without substance. There is a typical record in Volume 12 of the Book of Wei:

"Rong initially possessed extraordinary talent. At that time, Li Ying, the magistrate of Henan, had a great reputation and ordered his subordinates to screen guests, refusing to see anyone who was not a contemporary hero or a descendant of a prominent family. Rong, who was just over ten years old, wanted to observe his character, so he went to Ying's door and said to the doorman: I am a family friend of Lord Li. Ying saw Rong and asked: Have your father and grandfather ever interacted with me? Rong said: Yes! My ancestor Confucius and your ancestor Laozi shared the same virtues and principles, and were teachers and friends to each other. Therefore, Rong and you are family friends for generations. Everyone present was amazed. Chen Wei, a grand master of the court, arrived later. The people present told Wei about Rong. Wei said: Those who are clever when they are young may not be extraordinary when they grow up. Rong replied: According to what you say, were you really intelligent when you were young? Ying laughed loudly and said to Wei: You will surely become a great talent when you grow up."

From this, we can see Kong Rong's skill in colluding with powerful nobles and being good at using his tongue. However, although he refuted Chen Wei at the time, it was proven afterwards that Chen Wei's criticism of him was very accurate. This is not only seen in the fact that he could not become a "great talent," but also that he was executed by Cao Cao with the charge of "going against heaven and reason, corrupting morality," and did not die a good death. According to Sima Biao's Spring and Autumn Annals of Kyushu:

"When Rong was in Beihai, he aspired to great ambitions, established roots, and refused to be mediocre. However, those he appointed were curious and unorthodox, all of them frivolous talents. As for scholars who were versed in the classics, he pretended to be respectful, and although he treated them with full courtesy, he did not discuss state affairs with them... Lofty discussions of teachings and decrees filled the offices. His words and tone were gentle and lovely, but the examination of matters and the execution of affairs were difficult to implement."

This vividly portrays his character of being good at putting on a facade but not being practical, saying nice things but being a good-for-nothing. But this is not enough. There are several more wonderful supplements in Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms:

"...When the Yellow Turban bandits were about to arrive, Rong drank a lot of strong wine, personally mounted his horse, and resisted them above the Lai River. The bandit commander ordered his troops to confront Rong. The two wings crossed the river and went straight to the city wall along the river. The city fell, and Rong could not enter... The city was attacked by Yuan Tan. From spring to summer, the city was small and the bandits were numerous. Arrows fell like rain, but Rong sat calmly on his chair, reading and discussing as if nothing was happening. The people of the city fled, and he fled to Shandong, and his family was captured by Tan."

If you don't read the following, and only talk about the style of his opening moves, it is really something, and it is the first to win people over. But the results were the same twice, and he was defeated twice. The wind is strong and the thunder is weak. Kong Rong probably relied on this kind of posture to scare off the enemy, right?

Drinking heavily and bravely mounting his horse are commendable; remaining calm in the face of danger and responding calmly are admirable; but this requires a premise, that is, the enemy retreats in the face of the crowd, and the change is resolved in response to the change. Otherwise, pretending to be fat when your face is swollen is a matter of pride, to put it nicely, but in reality, isn't it just like what Bao Puzi said in Han Guo Su Li: "Those who are beautifully dressed and charming, but have no heart, are called擬神明徹 (imitating divine clarity); those who are eloquent and clever, and cater to others with skillful words, are called 標領淸妍 (leading the way to beauty); those who form cliques and praise each other, and whose actions contradict their words, are called 以為會友 (thinking they are friends); those who rely on powerful relatives and whose positions exceed their talents are called 四豪之匹 (equal to the four heroes)." These several "what is called" (謂之) are not worth a penny when you break them down. Is that what you call a famous scholar?

### A Medley of American Life

— By Xu Shu

The American Postal Service

My admiration for the excellence of the American postal service is not just admiration, it is downright worship, because I am constantly on the move, averaging once a month. During the war, letters from Chengdu, relayed through Kunming, India, and Africa, took at least two months to arrive. With all the transferring, it took three months to receive them, but in five years, not a single letter was lost. There are many cities with the same name in small American towns, such as Glendale, which has several. If the province is not specified in the letter, it is first sent to Glendale, California, and finally transferred to Glendale, Arizona. By the time the letter arrives, I have already moved several times, and the letter always follows me. The post office keeps a forwarding address for every departing soldier. Often, a letter is transferred to dozens of places, but it is still delivered to the addressee. It is never like the post offices in mainland China, which burn undeliverable letters (editor's note: in fact, this is not entirely the case). In fact, I am afraid that the postal authorities are simply too lazy to track down the addressee.

In the United States, you can enclose American dollar bills in a letter, affix three cents of postage, and send it. Diamond rings can also be sent as parcels without registering, and there is no worry of loss or exchange. When shipping a trunk through the post office, you can hand the key over to the post office, and the clothes in your trunk will never turn into tiles. But when you send letters or packages from the United States to China, you must register them, otherwise, the letter will be destroyed because someone likes the American postage stamp on the envelope. If you send a package, then your package will be robbed. I sent more than a dozen packages from the United States to Chengdu, but only one box of Western medicine arrived after I returned to the country. It turned out that the Western medicine had long expired and was worthless, but when I went to pick it up, I had to pay several dollars in postage and a lot in customs duties. (Fourteen)

### The Surviving Family of Zhu Xinggong

— By Wang Dian

During the Anti-Japanese War, many journalists who refused to submit to the threats and temptations of the enemy and puppet regime were martyred. Zhu Xinggong was one of them.

When Shanghai was filled with isolated islands, Zhu Xinggong was working as the night light supplement editor at the American-owned Da Mei Evening News. Although the environment was harsh, he still risked danger and did his best to expose the conspiracies of the enemy and puppet regime, comparing Wang Jingwei to King Lu of the Southern Song Dynasty, who sold out the country for personal gain. Therefore, he was suspected by the enemy and puppet regime and suffered despicable and shameless attacks.

First, Zhang, Wang Jingwei's sworn brother, came forward to invite Zhu Xinggong to be the editor of a puppet newspaper, claiming that the salary was generous and that he only needed to write one article a week supporting the enemy and puppet regime. Zhu Xinggong not only firmly refused, but also wrote an article denouncing Wang Jingwei and his pawns. Seeing that the lure of profit was unsuccessful, Wang Jingwei and his henchmen resorted to threats. In addition to receiving three threatening letters one after another, Zhang also pretended to invite Zhu Xinggong to a banquet, and those accompanying him were all officers of the puppet army. When the banquet ended, Zhang suddenly asked Zhu Xinggong for a wedding photo. Zhu Xinggong agreed at the time.

When he returned home and explained the situation to his wife, he felt that things were a bit strange, but since he had agreed, he could not break his promise. Moreover, under the circumstances at the time, he knew that this was a conspiracy, but he could not deny it. After much deliberation, he decided to send Zhang a photo of himself.

At 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 1939, Zhu Xinggong, as usual, put on his tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, took the manuscript he had just written, and took the tram to the Da Mei Evening News. However, less than half an hour later, he was shot and killed, a bullet piercing his right temple, and he was martyred at the tram stop.

Zhu Xinggong's wife now lives in Hangzhou and is a neighbor of the writer. The above is all what Mrs. Zhu told the writer in person. Now, the dead are indeed dead, but the living have fallen into distress. In the home in Hangzhou, in addition to Mrs. Zhu herself, there is also a five-year-old child named Yongyong, who is currently studying at the Shanghai Xinlu Normal School. Since her husband's martyrdom, Mrs. Zhu has become quite depressed due to the lack of support. She fasts and worships Buddha every day, spending her lonely years. However, in the current situation of high prices, although her son's schooling is provided by public funds, the clothes and other expenses, as well as her own three meals a day, are difficult to maintain. Therefore, she has to make some matchboxes and other handicrafts to supplement the family's expenses. The situation is tragic.

The government once issued a pension of 30,000 yuan to commend the loyal and martyred journalists, but it is said that it has not yet been received to this day. Even if you get this 30,000 yuan, you can't even buy a dou (a unit of volume) of white rice. Mrs. Zhu always burst into tears when she talked about this matter. She said that her husband died for the country, but the country has forgotten the life of his surviving family. These are extremely sad words.

Seeing the living conditions of Zhu Xinggong's surviving family, one can also imagine the surviving families of other martyred journalists. If the government wants to stabilize the lives of the surviving families and ensure that they have no complaints, then it is necessary to reconsider the issue of pensions. At the very least, it should allow the surviving families to live a good life, so that the martyred patriots can rest in peace in the afterlife.

### Humorous Anecdotes

— Gong Kou

Backfired

Old Zhang came to the writing room with an angry look on his face. His colleagues felt very strange and asked him, "Why are you so unhappy this morning?"

"Oh, nothing," he replied, "I just cut my hand with a safety razor, burned my clothes with a safety match, and almost dropped dead when I saw a sign that said 'Safety First When Driving'!"

### Arctic Sketches

— Pu Lun

Looking at a map, we can see that the distances between the eastern and western hemispheres at the two poles of the earth are very close; at the same time, we can see that most of the continents on the earth are distributed in the northern hemisphere, making the Arctic a passage between continents. Many years ago and even now, many dreamers and explorers have explored the two poles with a very strong scientific interest.

The history of the Arctic is short and simple. The first to develop the Arctic were the Pytheas, a Greek branch, who reached northern Norway; the time was 325 BC. There, they proved a cold, forever sunless and perennially frozen fact. The next to be examined were the Norsemen; then the British; then the Russians and Americans. At that time, the British wanted to find a road to China for trade; many of their sailors, whalers, and developers outlined the Arctic: the Arctic is like a large bowl-shaped sea that connects the edges of the continents of Europe, Asia, and North America.

Although the Arctic Ocean has five trillion tons of ice, and the temperature in Siberia is below ninety degrees, the cold Arctic is not as cold as we imagine. According to polar expert Hubert Wilkins, the average temperature in the Arctic during the hottest season is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Indeed, the Arctic summer is quite comfortable. Except for the northern Dakotas, most of the Arctic is warm, even in winter; and hurricanes rarely occur. At the same time, there is not much snow; sometimes, there are only nine feet of snow a year. In the Arctic, as in other southern places, it often rains. In northern Siberia, bayberries grow as big as plums. Even Soviet scientists have a professor named Tsitsim who has discovered a new seed that can grow in the Arctic.

The natural resources of the Arctic are very rich. Although there are no precise statistics on the quantity, the main raw materials of industry contain many types.

Belonging to the US zone, central Alaska has farms that have been cultivated with great success. Some of the best farmland in the world belongs to the northern part of Canada's Great Slave Lake, but most of it has not yet been reclaimed. Alaska also has countless square miles of uninhabited land. Its area is twelve times larger than that of New York State, but the total population is only 80,000, and the white population is only 33,000.

The Arctic region also has countless places, growing tall, lush, uncut trees; various kinds of islands, and countless wild animals. And the waters of the Arctic Ocean ripple, producing many kinds of fish, even whales.

As for the military minerals, there is no need to say more. North America's natural resources include Alaskan gold and iron, and one of the world's largest copper mines. The North American zone also has radium and coal mines, and part of the coal mines may be oil fields. In Canada, important resources are radium and uranium. The Soviet zone has rich coal mines and oil fields. Norilsk has copper and nickel mines; and Lena has gold mines. If the Soviet Union succeeds in obtaining radium mines in the Arctic, it will be even more remarkable.

The eastern part of the Arctic is almost entirely in the Soviet zone. Since the time of Caesar, the Russians have been developing the surface resources of these places in a scientific manner. They hope that the Soviet Arctic can be self-sufficient. Several years ago, the Soviet Union was always ahead of the United States in developing the Arctic.
