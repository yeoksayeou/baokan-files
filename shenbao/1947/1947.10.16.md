### Wei Ambassador's Report Delayed and Not Published; Washington Figures Speculate

Detailed Recommendations on Steps to Aid China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] General Wedemeyer's report on China is still a diplomatic mystery here. Mr. Wei submitted a formal report to President Truman and Secretary Marshall a month ago, but the contents have not been detailed so far. Many people are gradually realizing that the report may never be published. According to unconfirmed rumors, it was Secretary Marshall who shelved the report. As for the reason for shelving it, no one dares to speculate. An observer believes that Wei Demeyer has suggested detailed steps for material and financial and technical assistance. Allen, a Washington reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance, said in his article today that General Wei Demeyer's report has been distributed in seven copies. Recipients of the report include President Truman, Acting Secretary of State Lovett, Secretary of State Marshall, and the Department of Finance, the Army and Navy. Allen said that this lengthy report contains detailed suggestions on China and how China fits into its international position, but it does not detail the shortcomings of the Chinese government. The main part of the report is an analysis of the economic, political, military and social situation in China. One of the suggestions is that if the United States provides China with assistance again, the assistance should be supervised by the United States, including the actual distribution work. Allen also said that the Chinese government is aware of the content of Wei's report. According to a well-informed official, there may be three reasons for maintaining silence on the report: The report involves many government agencies, and it must be considered and acted upon after many days. The report's emphasis on a global aid plan prevents the State Department from coordinating, as the State Department is currently working hard to make Marshall's aid plan for Europe a reality. The Truman administration is afraid that if aid to China becomes a general public discussion topic at this time, it may have an adverse effect on the Marshall Plan.

### Byrnes Tells the Truth; Recalls the Failures of the Yalta Agreement

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Former Secretary of State Byrnes announced in his memoirs, "Speaking Frankly," that if the Soviet Union had made the opposite decision and not participated in the war when the Soviet Union fulfilled the conditions to participate in the war against Japan, he would have been happy. "Although Japan insisted on refusing to surrender unconditionally, I believed at the time that the atomic bomb could succeed and force Japan to surrender. When the Red Army entered the Northeast, I was worried about the future. Before they withdrew, my worries came true." Byrnes said that the military situation was completely different when the United States obtained the Soviet Union's promise at the Yalta Conference than when Lu Lian participated in the war. President Roosevelt and his military leaders at the time were eager for the Soviet Union to join the war, and no one could foresee the difficulties encountered after the Yalta Conference. Byrnes said that drafting the Japanese peace treaty would not be very difficult, but the issue of compensation would be a major problem. The Soviet Union insisted that the industrial equipment removed from the Northeast by the Red Army should be considered war trophies and not included in the compensation.

Editorial

### The Mission of the Academia Sinica

The Academia Sinica convened an evaluation council in the capital yesterday. According to reports, the main task of this meeting was to review candidates for academicians, so that after the election is proposed next year, the entire research system will be completed. It is heard that Weng Wenhao, Hu Xiansu, and others successively expressed their opinions at the meeting, calling on society and the government to pay attention to science. We cannot remain silent about the convening of the evaluation council of the nation's highest academic research institution at a time of national crisis and reconstruction.

The Academia Sinica is the highest academic research institution in the country. Since it is called research, to put it bluntly, it naturally involves splitting hairs. We should promote this kind of specialized research in order to catch up with others. However, we believe that it is also necessary to supplement it.

First, the Academia Sinica is not a private research institution, but a national research institution that uses the national treasury and is directly under the National Government. Therefore, all research plans should be based on the standpoint of the nation and the nation, and should be in line with the current national policy, and should not only listen to one's own or private preferences. This is the case with Soviet national institutions, and it is largely the case with research institutions in Britain and the United States that are maintained by the national treasury. Although the Academia Sinica is not a research institution established entirely based on the needs of national defense, its planned and ongoing research should always be in line with national policy.

Second, specialized research is certainly important, but the popularization of specialized academics in China today is perhaps no less important than specialized research. To this day, the textbooks of some domestic universities still have to select original Western texts, which fully shows that Chinese academics are not yet mature and cannot even talk about independence; even in the fields of Chinese history and philosophy, the situation is still unavoidable. It is heard that the pseudo-Academia Sinica established by the communist bandits is compiling and printing a general history of China based on so-called Marxism-Leninism. Why can't the Academia Sinica of the Republic of China compile a general history of China based on the Three Principles of the People in accordance with the Constitution? Since its establishment, the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica has indeed made great contributions in the field of specialized research, but it seems that it is still insufficient in terms of popularizing academics, especially in how to cooperate with our national policy. As for general scientific research, it should also be carried out in response to China's most urgent needs, so as not to betray the expectations of the country and the people for the Academia Sinica, which goes without saying.

Speaking of the election of academicians of the Academia Sinica, this is still an innovation in China. The term "academician" seems to be based on the system of members of the Royal Society of England and the French "Académie". In France and England, members of these two institutions enjoy high prestige. An Englishman who adds the abbreviation F.R.S. after his name seems to add supreme glory. However, this is a foreign system. They have taken root in foreign countries, buried in their soil, and become part of their cultural heritage. We transplanted this system, and we must also root it deeply in our soil so that it can become so. Therefore, we should be extra cautious in the election of academicians, and strive to ensure that the elected persons do not give people the feeling of being incompetent.

As for calling on the government and society to pay attention to science, we believe that the government and society should pay attention to science, and those engaged in science should especially know how to respect themselves; only by respecting themselves can others respect them. Today, how many people are loyal to science, enduring all kinds of difficulties and tribulations without leaving their posts. This spirit is worthy of universal admiration! However, there are also many people who study science or have been baptized by science who have left their posts and engaged in other things that can increase their power and wealth. They have abandoned science and left their inherent positions. This is certainly a great loss to the country, and they themselves may not feel pain. If Chinese scientists can completely liberate themselves from the traditional ideas of scholar-officials and no longer have the idea of "excelling in learning and then becoming an official," then scientists in China will surely have their supreme glory. We are currently in this transitional period of change, everything is changing, and we must also join the senior scholars of general scientific research in calling on the government and society to pay attention to science!

### World Young Women's Christian Association Conference

(Continued from page 1) The foreign guest reception center is located on the shore of West Lake, at the foot of Shishuta, facing the lake and backing the mountain, with a very beautiful environment. The conference venue is located in the conference hall of the foreign guest reception center. The venue is decorated simply and solemnly. The four walls are decorated with statistical comparison tables of work and photos of group activities and life. A rostrum is set up in the center, covered with white table cloth, and a large vase of osmanthus flowers is placed on the rostrum. The osmanthus flowers in the garden outside the venue are in full bloom, and a gust of wind blows, filling the room with fragrance. The conference chairman, Miss van Eyns, sits in the center, with Mrs. Ling Xianyang and Secretary-General Wu Simo sitting beside her. The chairs for the representatives are arranged in a semi-circle. At the beginning of the conference, there is a solemn and solemn spiritual practice program. All the representatives read the Bible, sang hymns together, and prayed in unison. The chairman then called the roll according to the list of representatives. There are more than 130 people, including planned representatives, attending representatives, and conference staff. After the roll call, Mrs. Ling Dayang, on behalf of the Chinese Young Women's Christian Association, presented a bright red large wooden fish. Mrs. Ling explained that the wooden fish is a local product of Hangzhou, which can be used as a permanent souvenir of the World Young Women's Christian Association Conference held in China. Chairman Van Eyns stood up to accept it. Since then, whenever attention is distracted in the venue, or a motion needs to be put to a vote, the chairman must strike the wooden fish, which becomes an important tool for controlling the atmosphere of the venue. Then, Miss Wu Simo, Secretary-General of the conference, read congratulatory telegrams sent by women's groups from all over the world, totaling more than 30. Several of them came from the Japanese Young Women's Christian Association, recounting that they were very happy to learn that the World Young Women's Christian Association Conference was opening in Hangzhou, and that their regret and frustration at not being able to participate due to environmental constraints were indescribable. According to reports, the Japanese representatives were unable to attend due to the opposition of the Far East Control Commission. In addition, there was one German representative at the conference, but Mr. Le had an understanding with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country that he could not express any opinions to the outside world.

### Contents of Speeches by Zhu Jiahua and Others

Zhu Jiahua said in his opening remarks: In the past year, the academic atmosphere has become increasingly strong. The development of domestic education and international cultural cooperation all require this highest research institution to enrich its equipment and strengthen its work. However, the current difficulties are even greater than during the Anti-Japanese War. The Academia Sinica is now trying to gradually concentrate the research institutes scattered in various places in the capital in order to maintain its integrity. The important significance of this evaluation council is to start to complete a rigorous research system, first determine a list of candidates for academicians from the nominations from all parties, so that elections can be held in the spring of next year to enrich the foundation of the Academia Sinica, start work, and catch up with Western academic civilization. Then, Mr. Wu Dingchang, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, conveyed the greetings and encouragement of President Chiang. Mr. Li Shizeng, Supervisory Committee member of the Central Committee, congratulated the meeting on its success. Mr. Li also elaborated that the Kuomintang has attached importance to academics since the beginning of the revolution. After the success of the Northern Expedition in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the Central Political Conference held a meeting in Dingjia Garden, which led to the establishment of the principles of the Beijing, Ping, and Zhejiang Research Institutes. Later, the Nanjing Research Institute, under the leadership of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, became increasingly developed and became today's Academia Sinica. The Beiping Research Institute, which he founded, still stands tall. He hopes that the two can cooperate closely and hold a joint conference at an appropriate time and place. During the speeches of the guests, Mr. Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, hoped that the Academia Sinica could discover the highest principles in the field of metaphysics to guide all cultural academics. Vice President Wang Yunwu, in addition to congratulating the meeting on its success on behalf of President Zhang, also said: He very much agreed with President Hu Shi's recent advocacy of academic independence, "believing that the quality of overseas students should be strictly examined, the number should be reduced, the mentality of gold-plating should be eliminated, and the foreign exchange saved each year can reach 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan, which can be used to enrich domestic universities, which is very worthwhile. Then, Hu Shi, representing the council members, replied that the Academician Election Committee had held four meetings and completed the preliminary review procedures for the 510 people proposed by various universities, colleges, research associations, and government agencies. After this review committee decides on the list of candidates and the government announces it in April to solicit opinions from people across the country, it will be selected at the fifth meeting in the spring of next year. At that time, the academic system can be completed, and the significance is very great. Mr. Hu also discussed that overseas students can be divided into two categories, one is the despicable gold-plating, and the other is the true academic researchers. The academic independence he recently advocated focuses on making universities research institutions, making domestic university degrees more honorable and employable than foreign doctorates. He also pointed out that the current government does not trust academic institutions too much and requires that the power to award degrees be completely handed over to universities, so as to avoid official complications and insult academic dignity. Weng Wenhao believes that as heaven changes, so does the Tao. Science progresses extremely fast, and the country is sorry for talents in terms of equipment and treatment, and should send them to foreign countries for research. Hu Xiansu believes that the government should pay attention to the resolution passed by the Supreme National Defense Council last year to use 1% of all national tax revenue as a special fund for science and realize it as soon as possible to strengthen national defense scientific research. After that, Mr. Li Shizeng conveyed Mr. Wu Zhihui's opinion on studying abroad, saying that studying abroad should be developed in a foreign country and does not necessarily cost too much money. Gold-plating is certainly unnecessary, but it is important to absorb the Western cultural spirit through studying abroad.

### Situation of the Public Trial of Jin Bihui

(Continued from page 1) Today, the trial was originally scheduled to start at 3:00 pm. By noon, the crowds holding hearing permits had already crowded around the temporary court in the back garden of the High Court, totaling more than 2,000 people. The trees around were also full of spectators. The court was set up in a small pavilion, surrounded by sturdy fir poles. Before the trial began, order could be maintained. When Jin Bihui was mentioned, the order was greatly disrupted. Jin was trapped in the car in the crowd for half an hour before being forcibly led to the court by military police. In the midst of the uproar, the question and answer between the Presiding Judge Wu Shenghan and Jin had to be conveyed loudly by the court. The court clerk was also unable to record everything. Then, the fir poles were broken by the crowd, and everyone rushed forward. Reporters and photographers from the China Electric Third Factory were squeezed out. Jin's defense lawyers, Li Yichen, Li Cao, and Ding Zuoshao, were also isolated. Many people were injured in the crowd. The court case was almost lifted up. Although there were many military police, they were helpless. Jin wore a green woolen suit and trousers, a white wool sweater, and shiny short hair. He looked around at the audience with a smile, seemingly very interested. Jin had a plan in mind, and his answers were calm and natural. Finally, at 4:00 pm, in extreme chaos, the court announced the suspension of the trial. Jin was escorted into a car by bailiffs in the midst of the crowd and taken back to the prison.

Presiding Judge's Remarks

Afterwards, Presiding Judge Wu told reporters the main points of today's questions and answers. According to him, Jin mostly evaded answering. However, in her confession that she had asked Wang Jingwei on behalf of the Japanese side whether he had contact with President Chiang when Wang Jingwei visited Japan, some evidence of espionage was also obtained. Mr. Wu said: Jin is the daughter of Prince Su. She was adopted as an adopted daughter by the Japanese Kawashima Naniwa when she was three years old. She received education from the Japanese imperial family from an early age and was rich in Bushido thought. Naniwa was an advisor to the Qing court and had close personal relationships with Prince Su and others. He advocated Sino-Japanese friendship and named Jin Kawashima Yoshiko. At the same time, he instilled in Yoshiko the idea of Sino-Japanese friendship. Yoshiko knew that she was the descendant of a Manchu Qing prince, so she deliberately restored the Manchu Qing. Jin claimed that she lived in Shanghai for several months when she was sixteen. Later, her brother Jin Bidong took her to Changchun. When Puyi formed the puppet Manchukuo, the puppet Manchukuo formed the "Dingguo Army" in Beipiao, wanting to incorporate miscellaneous troops. Jin participated in the independence of Changbai Mountain. Later, it was resolved by Tada Shun, and Jin returned to Changchun and lived around Tada. Later, she arrived in Ping. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese side did take her back to the country, but the reason could not be confirmed.

Jin's Confession

What was asked in court today was about the establishment of the "Dingguo Army" since the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo, until her inducing Ma Zhanshan and Li Du to be attached to "Manchukuo." Jin completely denied the unfavorable points. Jin admitted that the Japanese side had ordered her to form the "North China Self-Defense Army" and appointed herself as the commander-in-chief. Although she was granted a seal, she did not take office. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, when Wang Jingwei visited Japan, she met with Wang Jingwei together with Touyama Mitsuru and asked Wang whether he had contact with President Chiang? Wang replied, "Let's talk about it later." Jin reported to the Japanese side that "there was no contact." Jin denied that she had conspired with Honjo, Itagaki, and others to launch the September 18th Incident. She admitted that she had served as Konoe's secretary, had contact with Mrs. Tojo, and had close relationships with Tada Shun and Matsuoka Yosuke. She admitted that she had been recuperating in Tianjin in the 30th year of the Republic of China, but she evaded mentioning what kind of injury it was. In addition, in Jin's private letters, it was found that she often referred to herself as "this commander" or signed "Kawashima Little Prince" in her letters to others. In the letters to Jin from Jin's friends, it was found that they advised her to be more active or commented that her men's clothing was not suitable for her own work. In addition, there was also a novel about Jin's espionage activities, "The Beautiful Woman in Men's Clothing."

### First Inspection of Yantai (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

The Qishan Church in the Yantai city area rang its bells this Sunday for the first time in two years. I, the reporter, arrived on the fifth day after the recapture. American sailors arrived even earlier than we did; an American cruiser was anchored outside Yantai harbor. According to Mayor Ding Futing, there were one thousand communist guerilla fighters hiding in the city, carrying over four hundred short guns. The police haven't yet returned to their posts; the few local police he brought from Qingdao all scattered to their homes to visit their families as soon as they arrived in Yantai. Shops are gradually opening their doors, but there is no merchandise. Many once-bustling areas are now very deserted at night. Jinde Street and Dama Road, which specialized in export trade, are almost dead streets compared to before the war; some buildings have even closed down. A curfew is in effect at 10 PM, but by 7 PM, except for soldiers, the streets are deserted. This tense and uneasy atmosphere will hopefully gradually disappear soon. Yantai currently has a population of around 170,000 to 180,000, which is vastly different from Laiyang, another large city in Jiaodong recently recovered by the Nationalists. Laiyang only has 1,000 people.

Supplies Long Gone, Landmines Everywhere

Various signs indicate that the communist retreat was prepared at least a month in advance. This is the most noteworthy point. According to the people, for the past month, at least several hundred carts of supplies were transported out of the city every day, sometimes reaching over a thousand carts at once. The city government dug up light bulbs and tin, buried in the ground in the mountains forty miles away (these are the easiest things to break). Naturally, there were countless other items still in the ground. The Nationalist troops continuously dug things out of the ground as they advanced from Laiyang, including relief supplies (clothing, medicine, etc.) and ammunition. Thousands of rounds of Japanese heavy artillery shells were destroyed on the spot, while the relief supplies became "spoils of war".

When I arrived, landmines were still going off in the city. The communists had planted hundreds of mines, mostly Japanese heavy mines, near the customs house, on the breakwater, and in three locations within the city government. Almost every house, safe, and area that hadn't been checked by combat engineers was viewed with apprehension, marked with warning signs saying "Danger: Landmines". However, there was only one mine detector, making it impossible to keep up with the work.

So far, no one has been able to produce concrete "evidence" to indicate that the Soviet Union provided military aid to Yantai from Dalian. However, the people can remember three Soviet transport ships arriving in Yantai harbor from Dalian, one after another. Besides railroad tracks, it is unknown what other supplies were brought in, and railroad tracks are not easy to pack and conceal. It is estimated that these tracks could be used to make quite a few short guns, which any ordinary factory could do. As for what was transported back to Dalian, it was grain. However, the three ships could not have carried more than 20,000 tons at most, while the transportation by sailboats and small steamers is difficult for anyone to estimate. Even several days after the Nationalists retook Yantai, "refugees" were still arriving by sailboat from Dalian. Even the smallest sampan on the Huangpu River could sail on the Bohai Sea, traveling between Northeast China and Shandong. I saw that the local people handled them very skillfully. Dalian Daily used to arrive in Yantai regularly, but it is no longer available now.

Counterfeit Money Worth Less Than Fabric Trimmings

The most sudden loss for the people was the worthless "North Sea Currency", which completely froze exchange relationships and financial activity. Silver dollars and copper coins became the main currency (they originally had market prices). The military used legal tender, and within three days, the exchange rate of one hundred yuan for ten copper coins became fixed, and 30,000 yuan of legal tender for one silver dollar. In the Jiaodong area, "North Sea Currency" depreciated from 25 yuan of legal tender to one yuan, until it became completely worthless. On the first day that Yantai became a legal tender city, some soldiers bought a pair of leather shoes for 15,000 yuan. Within 24 hours, the price jumped geometrically three times, and then increased arithmetically. There are two possible reasons: one is ignorance of the true value of legal tender; the other is the desire to obtain new currency. Even though goods were scarce, due to the latter reason, prices were still very low (compared to Qingdao and Shanghai). Many women who appeared to be middle class or above were selling goods on the street. They desperately needed legal tender to buy food. They took out clothing and items they had hidden for many years and sold them on the street to exchange for a pitiful amount of legal tender, but it was very useful to them at the moment. Anyone with a conscience would feel that some things were simply being plundered. For example, famous lace, which had not been exported for many years, was now cheaper than local cloth in Shanghai (comparing by size).

Military Supply Ships Come and Go, People Stare

I arrived in Yantai on the Zhongtai cargo ship. Besides warships, this was the first merchant ship, but it was acting as a military supply ship, carrying 10,000 bags of military flour, as well as other passengers. The people gathered at the dock, watching the ship enter the harbor. The people always stared at this and that, burying their impressions and opinions deep in their hearts. A group of officers disembarked empty-handed, accompanied by their female relatives. They stared as well. When the military supply ship sailed back to Qingdao on the 12th, pianos, sofas, furniture, etc. were taken out of the harbor along with it. The people also stared. Some things had already been buried in the ground, while others were leaving before their eyes, both with unknown destinations. The "spoils of war" from Yantai were nothing more than these things. If one wanted to find a document or newspaper, or some good books, it was impossible. My efforts were equal to zero.

However, the British Consulate's archives were completely intact. It wasn't that they were well hidden, but that they hadn't been disturbed in the past. American Consul Xie Weizhi and British Acting Consul Ikeff arrived just as quickly as Mayor Ding Futing. They arrived on the Omei, the ship carrying Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing. There were less than 20 foreigners in Yantai, of French, Italian, British, and Greek nationalities. All were as poor as "Bi San", but compared to Chinese, their standard of living was still above average. When talking about the past situation, they were unwilling to express any opinions, mainly focusing on restoring their businesses. (To be continued)

### Slim Hope for Convening Special Session of Congress; US Revises European Aid Procedures; Emergency Aid Extended to End of Next Summer

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] After studying the attitude of Congress and the possibility of emergency measures, the Truman Cabinet has revised the timetable for foreign aid. Although government officials insisted that no decision has been made, they stated that plans to cancel the special session of Congress in early December are under consideration. The temporary aid program will be extended to the end of the fiscal year on June 30, 1948, and the Marshall Plan will begin immediately thereafter. This new plan depends on two points being clarified: 1. Can Congress make a definite commitment to take swift and appropriate action on the temporary aid program when it reconvenes in early January next year? 2. Can the necessary funds for temporary aid be obtained without Congressional approval? The initial participation of the Export-Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation in yesterday's key White House meeting suggests that funds for temporary aid can be obtained without Congress. Since the Export-Import Bank has already allowed France to use $90 million of loans originally intended for construction projects to pay for essential goods, it is possible to use the Bank's $800 million capital, or at least a portion of it, for emergency aid to France and Italy. US government officials stated that abandoning the plan to convene a special session of Congress is causing displeasure for both the government and Congress. Many officials believe that if Congress can be kept in a calm state and convinced to approve appropriate emergency funding for aid in the first six months of 1948, and then review the comprehensive long-term reconstruction plan for Europe, there will be a greater hope of successfully passing the aid plan through Congress. It is reported that Sir Franks, Chairman of the European Economic Cooperation Committee of 16 nations, informally discussed the previous plan of the US government when he visited US Undersecretary of State Lovett and Clayton yesterday. At the same time, the situation in France and Italy has improved. In addition to obtaining the Export-Import Bank's approval to use $90 million in loans, France can also receive approximately $90 million in value of gold looted by the Nazis, and approximately $36 million in value of gold looted by Japan. In addition, the compensation of approximately $50 million that the US gives to France because of the US military's presence in France is also being negotiated in Paris. Italy is expected to receive gold worth approximately $30 million from the Nazi-looted gold.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The chances of convening a special session of the US Congress are decreasing daily. Congressional sources report that President Truman has not obtained guarantees from the Republican side to limit the meeting to discussing the $580 million foreign aid bill. It is claimed that Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reported to government leaders that he believes it is inevitable to deal with the European economic crisis in a "package" manner. Supporters of the government believe that Vandenberg's words are intended to merge the long-term Marshall reconstruction plan with Truman's request for an emergency bill to help France, Italy, and Austria get through the winter. Democratic senators privately stated that this move would force them to support the European reconstruction plan, even though the exact amount required by the plan has not yet been determined.

### Arab League Resolves to Impose Economic Blockade on Jews; Over a Hundred Chiefs Determined to Defend the Holy Land

[This Newspaper] London, 15th Broadcast - Beirut News, Arab countries continued to meet today, during which they unanimously voted to close their borders and intensify the boycott of the entry of Jewish goods as part of the anti-Jewish movement.

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 14th] The Arab world is filled with war clouds. According to news from the capitals of various Arab countries: - The Arab government in exile in Bhaghdadi is being formed, possibly led by Grand Mufti al-Husseini; - All Arab countries have formed a joint general staff; - Seven Arab countries are cooperating militarily, such as Syria being responsible for cavalry, Transjordan being responsible for mechanized forces, Lebanon being responsible for infantry, Saudi Arabia being responsible for the air force, and Egypt and Iraq being responsible for artillery and medical supplies.

[Reuters, Beirut, 14th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam stated today that the Arab countries' discussions on Palestine have ended. These discussions were held in Damascus, the capital of Syria, Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, and Amman, the capital of Transjordan. Yesterday, a round table meeting was held in the palace of King Abdullah of Transjordan, and a complete agreement has been reached on all points. According to sources here, King Abdullah has agreed to abandon his Greater Syria plan, at least temporarily, to avoid hindering the Arab League's unified position on the Palestine issue. The selection of the Arab military commander-in-chief is still pending.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 15th] According to credible sources, over a hundred chiefs in the Beersheba district held a meeting in the desert and sent a telegram to the exiled Islamic Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in Cairo, stating, "We support Your Excellency in defending the country." The chiefs decided to support the Arab Higher Committee's policy of "Defending Palestine" and decided to establish a "National Guard".

### Syrian Representative Opposes Formation of International Police Force; US Wary of Soviet Influence Expansion

[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] Syrian Representative Zeineddine warned today that the UN-proposed Palestinian police force will inevitably cause bloodshed, and if Syria agrees to it, it would be tantamount to inviting war and destruction.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The Soviet Union's support for the partition of Palestine in UN organizations has raised the issue of Soviet troops being stationed in the eastern Mediterranean for the first time. When US Representative Johnson explained the US's attitude in the UN General Assembly's Palestine Special Committee last Saturday, he stated that in order to maintain law and order during the transition period, special police forces need to be organized by recruiting volunteers from the United Nations. If the Soviet Union agrees to partition in principle and then expresses its willingness to help implement this solution, then it is expected that Soviet citizens will be very enthusiastic about serving as volunteer police officers.

### Trusteeship Committee Passes Indian Proposal

[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] Despite strenuous opposition from colonial powers and the United States, the UN Trusteeship Committee today passed a resolution favoring the view that the trusteeship system is a shortcut to promoting the independence of colonies worldwide, with 25 votes in favor, 23 against, and 3 abstentions. This resolution was proposed by India.

### French Strike Wave Expands, Government Discusses Countermeasures

[United Press, Paris, 15th] Under the instigation of the Communist Party, the strike by Paris transport workers has lasted for two days. The French Cabinet held an urgent meeting on the 15th to discuss countermeasures. Prime Minister Ramadier reported on the seriousness of the labor problem and the government's emergency measures. Currently, the government and the workers have reached a complete stalemate. Ramadier stated that he would no longer hold negotiations with the General Confederation of Labor. Various unions in Paris will meet on the 16th, which may cause some sympathy strikes. Currently, there are five labor strikes in France: Paris transport workers, Renault car factory, American railway workers, Paris tractor factory, and the weather station.

[United Press, Paris, 14th] The French government took firm measures today to deal with the transport workers' strike. The government has requisitioned 300 private buses to maintain the minimum level of transportation in the metropolis. It has also summoned temporary drivers to operate vehicles and 1,500 military trucks to temporarily carry passengers, but the strike is beginning to expand to other industries tonight.

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] French merchant sailors are demanding improved treatment. If they do not receive a satisfactory answer today, then starting on Thursday morning, 6,000 officers and 25,000 sailors on French-flagged ships in French and Algerian ports will go on strike.

### Clayton Resigns

[United Press, Washington, 14th] According to reliable sources, Undersecretary of State Clayton, one of the main planners of the Marshall Plan, has submitted his resignation to President Truman. Clayton's resignation is mainly due to personal health issues. He is 67 years old and one of the richest millionaires in the United States. He submitted his resignation a month ago, but Marshall retained him until now.

### Churchill Predicts the Soviets Will Withdraw from the United Nations

[United Press, New York, 14th] Churchill broadcast on the 14th that the Soviet Union and its satellite states may withdraw from the United Nations, creating two worlds, but this division does not necessarily lead to war. Churchill's speech was similar in its directness to his speech in Fulton last year. He said that in fact, the Soviet Union's withdrawal would be a good thing, as both sides could then know themselves and their opponents. Churchill said that war occurs because the two sides in the conflict believe that their forces are equal, but if the Soviet Union and its dependencies withdraw from the United Nations and form an independent group, the forces of the two sides will never be equal.

### United Nations Economic Committee Approves Marshall Plan

### China Supports UN Proposal to Establish a Small Assembly with Conditions; Soviets Disagree and Mock the US for Being Eager to Play with Fire

[This Newspaper] New York, 15th Broadcast: Lake Success News: The UN General Assembly Political Committee met today. China and Uruguay supported the US proposal to establish a 55-nation "Small Assembly", but Chinese Representative Gu Weijun insisted that the powers of the "Small Assembly" should be limited.

[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] The Soviet Union today attacked the US's proposal to the UN General Assembly to establish a temporary "Small United Nations Assembly". After US Representative Dulles presented the proposal in the Political Committee, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky immediately stood up and declared, "If the United States is willing not to include issues such as the Korean issue on the agenda, then the Assembly will not be "overworked". He reiterated the Soviet Union's proposal that if the United States agrees to withdraw its troops, Soviet troops will withdraw from Korea and "let the Koreans decide the form of their government themselves."

Vyshinsky said, "The United States claims on the one hand that the Assembly's work is too heavy, while on the other hand, the agenda is full of unnecessary topics, such as the independence of Korea, which should be submitted directly to the Koreans after the troops withdraw at the end of this year. The agenda also includes extremely difficult and contentious topics. What reason do you have to include them on the agenda? This is completely contrary to logic and reason." Vyshinsky attacked the US proposal, saying, "Dulles does not dare to directly state that he has a hidden reason that he cannot announce. Madmen often enjoy playing with fire, but it is regrettable that responsible figures in a large country like the United States are also eager to play with fire. The US proposal has received swift assistance from Bolivia, but this proposal not only fails to achieve the purpose of establishing the United Nations, but may have the opposite effect. It cannot strengthen the United Nations, but is sufficient to weaken it. This proposal will weaken the evil forces that oppose the sale of wars. After the "Small Assembly" is established, the United States' efforts to create new wars by propagandizing with a batch of lies can also be unobstructed. The Soviet delegation believes that any situation that weakens the United Nations at this time is enough to nourish new war peddlers. Dulles may have completely forgotten about this, otherwise Dulles would not have the courage to explain this matter." Vyshinsky said, "Although the US proposal has its secret nature, it ultimately shows that the United States is extremely dissatisfied with the way the United Nations is proceeding. When the United States found it impossible to legally abolish the veto power, it resorted to other methods. The Soviet delegation believes that the US proposal is only part of its plan, the purpose of which is not to respect the Charter, but to replace the Security Council with a similar committee in order to abolish the overall agreement between major powers, because this is precisely what makes it impossible for the United States to obtain dictatorial power in the United Nations."

### Impasse in Security Council Election of Members

[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] The deadlock in the election of members to the Security Council does not seem easy to break. The Latin American delegation held another secret meeting last night, and they do not seem to have changed their position on supporting Ukraine. Rumors that six Latin American countries will switch to supporting India have not been confirmed.

### US Army Warns Soldiers to Defend Against Possible Soviet Attack

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The US Army printed a booklet on the 14th and distributed it to US troops around the world. The content warned the three services that the Soviet Union intends to use its control of the European continent to launch offensive wars in "any direction". The booklet is for US military commanders to teach soldiers about world geography and political knowledge. It also stated that the Soviet Union can move westward into Europe, eastward into China, and northward across the Arctic to North America. The Soviet Union's geographical situation is particularly favorable for offense and unfavorable for defense, because the Soviet territory is vast and the military is easy to disperse.

### Stalin on Long-Term Recuperation

[United Press, London, 14th] Moscow Radio broadcast today, revealing that Premier Stalin is currently recuperating in the Black Sea region. According to the radio station, Stalin met with members of the British Labour Party in the Black Sea region, at Shaqi. Stalin will celebrate his 60th birthday on the 21st of this month.

### Soviet Gold Shipped to the US

South Africa shipped gold worth US$7,877,410 to the US, exceeding half of the total amount.

### Results of Rome City Elections Announced: Left and Right Wings Equally Matched; Rumors of Gasperi Cabinet Reorganization

[United Press, Rome, 14th] The final vote count of the city council elections today showed that the Communist-controlled People's Bloc and the Christian Democrats each won 27 seats in the 80-seat city council. The difference in votes between the two parties was less than 1 percent. The remaining votes were divided among various small parties, ranging from moderate leftists to Fascists. With the two sides evenly matched, it is expected that the new council will fall into a stalemate on the issue of electing a mayor.

[Reuters, Rome, 14th] It is reported that the Christian Democrats intend to nominate the current Minister of Defense Qin Gulani as mayor, which confirms the rumors that Gasperi will reorganize the cabinet after the city elections. Some leaders of the moderate left-wing Republican and Social Workers' parties, such as Saragat, are expected to join the cabinet.

### Security Council Discusses Indo-Dutch Dispute; China Supports British Proposal; Jiang Tingfu Expresses Sympathy for Indonesian Independence Movement

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 14th] Chinese Representative Jiang Tingfu stated in his speech to the Security Council today that China supports the Indonesian independence movement, but cannot agree with or support the various atrocities committed against civilians by irregular forces in the Indonesian army. We believe that this kind of behavior is not an appropriate way to move towards independence.

Although I have received many telegrams from overseas Chinese in Indonesia complaining about the abuse they have suffered from Indonesian irregular forces, I have not submitted them to the Security Council because: 1. I do not want to hinder the independence movement of the people of this fraternal country; 2. The Indonesian leaders have made sincere efforts to stop the atrocities. Although the overseas Chinese in Indonesia have suffered all kinds of abuse, in their telegrams to the Chinese government and myself, they still advocate that Indonesia should obtain political independence. The Chinese government can support the Soviet proposal for the complete withdrawal of Dutch troops, and can also support the Australian proposal for a limited withdrawal of Dutch troops, but this must be accompanied by guarantees that the various adverse conditions that will occur after the withdrawal of Dutch troops will not happen, because currently these guarantees are still lacking. Therefore, the Chinese delegation supports the British proposal, that this issue should be handed over to the three-person committee and the consular committee for handling.

### Japanese Yen Exchange Rate: China Advocates Careful Decision; Discussion in the Allied Council for Japan

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The Allied Council for Japan held a meeting on the 15th. Chairman Sebald, the US representative, reported that without determining the Japanese yen exchange rate, foreign trade cannot be fully developed, so the exchange rate should be determined as soon as possible, and said that this was MacArthur's intention. The representatives present mostly agreed with this. The Chinese representative stated that in order to revive Japan's trade, it is indeed appropriate to determine the Japanese yen exchange rate as soon as possible, but Japan's economy has not yet returned to normal, and determining the exchange rate is a practical issue. We must pay particular attention to ensuring that it does not affect Japan's wage and price system, so we must decide carefully. British and Soviet representatives also stated that it was necessary to determine the exchange rate. It was subsequently decided to submit this issue for further discussion at the next meeting.

### Brazil May Sever Relations with the Soviet Union

### French Army Launches Offensive on French-Controlled Gaoping City

### Seventh Letter from Poland: Floating Images of Society Behind the Iron Curtain – The Lonely Poles (Part 2)

— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing for This Newspaper

"Foreign Minister Beck" died in Romania at the beginning of the war. After the Communist Party came to power, Piłsudski's achievements in "founding the country" were also completely erased. Piłsudski Square in the center of Warsaw is now renamed "Victory Square." The original bronze statue of Piłsudski has been removed. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the Polish Restoration (1914-1918) beneath the bronze wall still enjoys offerings of flowers and fragrant grasses. Although, purely in theory, the Communist Party once denied that the "restoration movement" originated from the wishes of the Polish people.

On the day of the Lublin government's independence day, I visited Piłsudski Square for the entire afternoon. It was a scenic spot imitating Versailles. Thousands of Polish men, women, and children were there watching the "show." In reality, watching the "show" was also a facade, because apart from the Communist Party's loudspeaker broadcasts, there was nothing exciting to see. People were just looking at each other, passing their lonely days.

The Polish people are lonely. I feel that using "lonely" to describe the spiritual life of the Polish people today is not an exaggeration. War and disaster caused the death of nine million young Polish men. A small Warsaw newspaper said: now, on average, nineteen young women are pursuing one young Polish man. Love in Warsaw, and in many other Polish towns, is developing in an unbalanced "couple force," and the spiritual life associated with love is especially terrifyingly lonely.

One evening after the sun had set, I strolled along "Marszałkowska" Avenue, the busiest street in Warsaw. A large group of lonely Polish people were watching two drunks arguing. The crowd surged back and forth like waves, using this to pass their lonely days.

The Polish government is now also making every effort to carry out cultural construction, and the Ministry of Culture has proclaimed the slogan "Providing Spiritual Life." At a press conference held by the International Propaganda Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I was very interested in hearing a report from the person in charge of drama movements in the Ministry of Culture. That gentleman said: Poland had no drama for a full six years during the Nazi occupation. After liberation, many theater buildings were destroyed. "Drama Movement" workers started rebuilding from the ruins, working through thorny thickets. To date, Poland already has thirty-three large-scale "national theaters," and the number of small-scale state-run theatrical troupes scattered throughout the country reaches eight thousand. In the past year, the total number of audiences in theaters across the country reached ten million, four times more than before the war. The Ministry of Culture also founded three advanced drama academies and is responsible for raising the salaries of actors across the country. Before the war, an actor earned an average of 4,000 to 6,000 Polish złoty, but now it has increased to 14,000 to 32,000 Polish złoty (monthly salary). He said, "Because prices have risen, the material life of drama workers is still difficult."

He said: It is not easy to save the spiritual life of the entire Polish nation. The Ministry of Culture is now working closely with the "National Drama Association" to promote work competitions, especially performances of great Polish dramatist "Wyspiański" and Shakespeare's famous plays. Fourteen national theaters participated in this work competition, and the results were particularly good. He also said: The Drama Association is a combined organization of writers, actors, and artists from all over Poland. The Ministry of Culture recently allocated 100 million Polish złoty to reward theater managers and actors with outstanding achievements.

At the press conference, several "insiders" who understood drama were present. British and American reporters were particularly interested in the Polish people's enthusiastic welcome of Shakespeare's plays. In addition, George Bernard Shaw's plays have also been translated into Polish. Over the past year, the Ministry of Culture has translated nearly a hundred famous foreign plays. Russian dramas such as those by Ostrovsky, Gogol, and Chekhov are also quite in line with the tastes of Polish audiences. "About one-fifth of the theaters are designated by the Ministry of Culture to stage excellent works by young writers, and the Polish government provides special bonuses for promising young playwrights. Pious Catholics in their twenties, Różewicz and the biology student Czyżewska, have both received this bonus one after another."

Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to see the drama competition being staged in Warsaw. During my very hurried stay, my overseas Chinese friends, Mr. and Mrs. Zhuo Jinlan, invited me to watch a Russian film. That day was Sunday, and several cinemas were designated for Communist Party members to watch movies for free, and others were not allowed to enter. We lingered in front of a commercial cinema on the southern section of Marszałkowska Avenue, where there were "scalpers" selling black market tickets facing us. My friends said: Buying movie tickets is not an easy thing in Warsaw. I often think of this sentence, thinking of those lonely Polish people!

### Six Electricity Companies Simultaneously Lament Hardship – Unanimously Request Price Increase Starting from October – Otherwise, Shanghai Will Become a World of Darkness

[Report from This Newspaper] The central government will make a decision on the adjustment of prices for various public utilities in this city within days. Regarding electricity prices, each company requests implementation starting from October 1st. Shanghai Electric Power Company and Huxi Electric Power Company are requesting an adjustment to 2,700 yuan per kilowatt-hour (currently 1,130 yuan per kilowatt-hour). The French-owned Yongdian Company is requesting an adjustment to 3,340 yuan per kilowatt-hour (currently 1,132 yuan per kilowatt-hour). The Chinese-owned Dianqi Company and Pudong Dianqi Company are requesting an adjustment to 3,360 yuan per kilowatt-hour (currently 1,255 yuan per kilowatt-hour). Zhabei Shuidian Company is requesting an adjustment to 3,370 yuan per kilowatt-hour (currently 1,260 yuan per kilowatt-hour). If this new price is approved by the central government, it will be retroactively applied from October 1st.

The six major companies held a reception for reporters yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. on the sixth floor of the Shanghai Electric Power Company on Nanjing Road to discuss the electricity price issue. Present were Hopekin and Wang Jingrong from Shanghai Electric Power; Xue Meng and Yang Guangyu from the French-owned Shuidian; Huang Bingquan from the Chinese-owned Dianqi; Lu Zidong from Zhabei Shuidian; Tong Shoumin from Pudong Dianqi; and over thirty reporters from various newspapers. During the meeting, representatives from each company reported on their difficulties, stating that the companies are still charging fees based on the prices adjusted on July 1st, but the exchange rate has been adjusted from 12,000 yuan to 56,000 yuan. Companies that need foreign exchange for raw materials account for 80 percent. If electricity prices are not adjusted promptly, they will incur losses to the point of being unable to sustain themselves. Each company also unanimously requested the implementation of an automatic electricity price adjustment method to seek a permanent solution.

Shanghai Electric Power Company Loses 3.3 Billion Daily

Wang Jingrong, an engineer at Shanghai Electric Power Company, explained the retroactive collection of electricity fees, stating: This method of retroactive collection of electricity fees is entirely reasonable. Taking Shanghai Electric Power Company as an example, since the exchange rate adjustment on September 25th, the company has been losing 3.3 billion yuan daily. In the past 20 days, expenditures have reached 112 billion yuan, while income has only been 46 billion yuan, resulting in a loss of 66 billion yuan. The company is unable to repay this amount and can only take it from users. The main items of electricity cost are fuel and maintenance materials, supplies, salaries, and basic capital costs. Since the adjustment of electricity prices on July 1st, all have soared in price. Therefore, an application has been submitted to adjust the electricity price for ordinary users to 2,700 yuan per kilowatt-hour starting from October 1st. This projection assumes that 50 percent of the import tax on fuel oil is levied at the contract price of Shanghai Electric Power Company. If the import tax is calculated at market price, each kilowatt-hour will increase by another 360 yuan. Before the new electricity price is approved, the company loses more than 99 billion yuan per month. If this situation continues for only a short period of time, the company will be unable to purchase fuel or pay wages, and Shanghai will have no electricity supply.

Lu Zidong of Zhabei Shuidian Company stated: The company uses coal entirely. It is allocated by the Fuel Management Committee. Even if only the coal price is calculated, excluding other expenses, one kilowatt-hour of electricity requires 1,500 yuan, but the current electricity fee is 1,260 yuan per kilowatt-hour, so it is impossible to sustain operations.

French-owned Shuidian Hopes to Reduce User Waste

Yang Guangyu of the French-owned Shuidian Company stated: The company's entire power supply comes from diesel generators. Most of the area consists of residential households, and industrial electricity consumption accounts for only 20 percent. Therefore, it is hoped that the electricity fee for residential lighting can be increased, while the electricity fee for production use can be lowered, so as to reduce user waste and increase production. Huang Bingquan of the Chinese-owned Dianqi Company stated: The company's 16,000 kilowatt generators were transported to North China by the Japanese during the occupation of Shanghai. Currently, 80 percent of the electricity is purchased from Shanghai Electric Power Company. Because the transmission line is as long as 35 kilometers, there are significant losses along the way. Therefore, the electricity price requested for adjustment is slightly different from that of Shanghai Electric Power Company. The electricity price in Suzhou in October is 5,660 yuan per kilowatt-hour, and other places have prices as high as 10,000 yuan or more per kilowatt-hour. Therefore, the electricity price in Shanghai is actually very low. Tong Shoumin of Pudong Dianqi Company also reported on the company's losses and requested prompt adjustment.

Adjustment Method to Be Discussed Today

[Report from This Newspaper] The automatic adjustment method for public utility prices in this city, which the Public Utilities Bureau previously planned to submit, has been reviewed by two experts from the Electrical Engineering Society, Zhong Zhaolin and Hong Chuanjiong, who have drafted an opinion and sent it to the bureau. The Public Utilities Bureau has specifically scheduled a discussion meeting this afternoon to synthesize opinions from all parties and discuss them.

Furthermore, Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, visited President Zhang of the National Bank yesterday regarding the issue of import taxes on fuel oil, requesting that they be levied according to the contract price of the electricity company, rather than calculated according to the market price, in order to reduce electricity costs. President Zhang expressed his approval and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for consultation.

### Automobile Fuel Quota to Be Distributed in Three Levels

[Report from This Newspaper] The method for rationing automobile fuel in this city will change. The Automobile Fuel Quota Review Committee met yesterday and unanimously agreed that there was a need for improvement. It was decided to divide cars and trucks into three levels (large, medium, and small) based on their curb weight, and allocate the actual amount of fuel used. The detailed method will be discussed and decided by the Public Utilities Group of the City Council, which will convene today.

### Using Legal Campaign Activities to Set a Good Example of Democracy – Kuomintang Candidate Party Members' Symposium – Jiang Jingguo Attends and Encourages Efforts

The Kuomintang Municipal Party Department convened a symposium yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Yingcha Club on Shaoxing Road, gathering party members in this city who are candidates for the National Assembly, Legislative Yuan, and Municipal Council, and invited Instructor Jiang Jingguo to attend and give instructions. Mayor Wu, Chairman Fang, and candidates Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Zhongxing, Zhan Wenyu, Zhou Yizhi, Cao Jun, Ma Junshuo, Fang Zhichao, Wang Xinheng, Luo Jiaowei, Jin Zhenyu, Jiang Hong, Qian Jianqiu, Shi Zhifu, Mao Zipei, Zheng Ziliang, Zhao Junhao, and over one hundred others attended. Chairman Fang first introduced each candidate to Instructor Jiang and read aloud a telegram from the Central Party Department, which stated that comrades of this party participating in the election should adopt a new style in order to establish the party's credibility among voters. All forms of bribery, coercion, and violence should be prohibited, and normal legal activities, such as speeches, propaganda, encouraging construction, and promoting public welfare, should be earnestly carried out as a demonstration for the people and comrades, in line with the purpose of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization and Economy Movement.

Recognize Obligations, Not Rights

Instructor Jiang Jingguo was then invited to give instructions, saying: "Holding this election is a major task in the history of our party. Now, the communist bandits are harming the country and the people, and military suppression of the rebellion will be difficult to end in the short term. Prices are soaring incessantly, and the people are suffering greatly. Holding elections is very difficult. However, in order to take into account the needs of the environment and cooperate with the revolutionary process, the central government has decided to hold the elections as scheduled, even in the midst of hardship. As party members, we should understand the party's difficulties and the President's distress, absolutely obey the party's orders, and engage in campaigning with legal actions, setting a good example of democracy. All of you comrades have a glorious history of serving the party and have made great contributions to society. I hope that you will first of all recognize that campaigning is a party member's obligation, not a right, and should sacrifice personal interests to take care of the party's interests. Currently, many unreasonable election phenomena are occurring in various places, such as bribery, coercion, and violence. These should not exist in Shanghai. In short, I hope that you will obey the central government's regulations, engage in reasonable campaign activities to reduce the party's difficulties, successfully complete the election work in Shanghai, and serve as a model for all parts of the country."

Personal Interests Should Be Sacrificed

After his speech, Mayor Wu was invited to speak, saying: Candidates should consider being elected as an obligation, not as a right, and should sacrifice personal interests to protect the party's interests. Campaigning must adopt legal activities, and elections must not be conducted in an illegal manner. We should emulate the style of political party elections in democratic countries. At this point, Chairman Fang reiterated to the candidates: You should immediately mobilize and go to various districts to give speeches to the people, in coordination with the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction. You should use various forms of publicity, written and oral, to replace bribery. After the speech, candidates Luo Dunwei, Cheng Zhongxing, Pan Gongyan, Chen Peide, Qiu Xisheng, and others successively expressed their opinions, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. At about 5 o'clock, Chairman Fang summarized everyone's opinions, made a concrete conclusion, and, after serving refreshments, announced the adjournment of the meeting.

### Permitting Improvement in Compilation of Workers' Cost of Living Index

Water Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, and others went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and proposed suggestions to improve the compilation of the index: 1. For the rice item, the government is still using the base price of the first-grade Saigon rice and second-grade old rice in 1936. However, the rice currently included in the index is the low-quality of配給米(rationed rice), and the base price should be corrected. 2. The rent price set by the municipal government is very low, especially the water fee item in the rent, which is calculated inaccurately. 3. The rice, coal, oil, and other items in the daily necessities item are all compiled based on the price of rationed goods. In fact, some workers have not been allocated rations and still purchase coal and oil on the black market. This should be corrected when compiling the index. Director Wu and Director Zhang of the Statistics Office responded one by one, stating that regarding the first item, the rice price, the municipal government will decide after a detailed investigation of the base price in 1936. For the second item, the rent price, the municipal government has improved the calculation, that is, the water fee item, which was originally surveyed every six months, will be changed to every three months. For the third item, the municipal government plans to compile a monthly index based on the market price of coal, oil, and other items at the end of each month, and compare it with the original index compiled based on the rationed price to calculate the difference. If the factory does not collect rations for the workers, the difference will be paid in addition to the salary. This point will be proposed and passed by Director Zhang at tomorrow's municipal government meeting and will be implemented immediately.

### Dancing Girl Reverses Testimony During Continued Trial for Robbery

[Report from This Newspaper] The case of Cao Ping (aka Cao Ruiying), a dancing girl at the Jinshan Dance Hall, robbing the home of Cai Zhu on Huiji Road on July 7, was re-examined by the Criminal Court 2 of the District Court at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. Cao Ping was wearing a coat, white leather shoes, and covering her face with a handkerchief. She vehemently denied holding a gun to rob, reversing her previous testimony. Judge Shao asked who Zhang Guanglie was to her. Cao replied that he was a friend. When asked whether they had discussed holding a gun to rob Cai's home, Cao firmly denied it, saying that she only borrowed money from Cai Zhu, but she refused, so she snatched off the gold bracelet, which Zhang Guanglie took away. Cai called the police from the window, and she and Zhang fled to the Bund Park. Then, accomplice Zhang Nuchun testified: He had been sentenced to eight years for robbery and had known Zhang Guanglie since June. Because he was selling rice from Songjiang, he asked Zhang to help him sell it. Zhang owed him money, and Zhang asked him to come to Shanghai to pay him back. He is a vocational youth and does not have any firearms. On July 7, he waited on Xizang Road at 11 a.m. for about a quarter of an hour. Zhang Guanglie handed him the gold bracelet. Together, they went to Bund Park. He did not go to Cai Zhu's home. The court adjourned the case for further trial.

### Difficult to Determine Price for Six Dishes and One Soup; Restaurant Industry Says It Will Affect Nutrition

[Report from This Newspaper] Since the authorities announced the regulations for economizing on banquets, the Restaurant Industry Association convened a meeting of members of the fifteen major cuisine categories in this city yesterday to discuss the price issue of six dishes and one soup. No resolution was reached until late in the evening, and it was heard that the meeting would continue on the 18th. According to the members of various restaurants in the industry, the most significant impact of the regulations for economizing on banquets will be on some of the larger restaurants. The restriction of six dishes and one soup may reduce their total turnover by half. However, most medium-sized restaurants currently focus on selling snacks and客飯 (set meals), and in fact, they have very few banquets, so the economizing regulations will not have any impact on them. As for the industry negotiating prices on its own, there are many difficulties at this time of fluctuating prices. It was also heard that the Western Restaurant industry will also convene a meeting within days to discuss the price of two dishes and one soup.

Economizing on Banquets to Begin on the 20th; Foreign Wine and Shark Fin for Home Use Not Prohibited

[Report from This Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau, the 3rd Battalion of the Military Police, the Police Bureau, the New Life Movement Committee, the restaurant industry, the Western restaurant and coffee industry, the catering industry, the seafood industry, the hotel industry, and other nine units discussed the continued implementation of measures for economizing on dishes at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and resolved: Economizing on banquets will begin on the 20th of this month. The regulations limit Western cuisine to two dishes and one soup, and Chinese cuisine to six dishes and one soup. The prices will be set by the Chinese and Western restaurant industries themselves and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval by the 18th. Shark fins, sea cucumbers, and ship-imported foreign wines are all luxury goods and are absolutely prohibited from sale, but not prohibited for home use.

Rice for the Poor to Be Distributed at Legally Stipulated Price, Still 160,000 Yuan

[Report from our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the People's Food Allocation Committee had already instructed all districts to collect rice for the poor, so general distribution would begin no later than next week. The price will remain the original price of 160,000 yuan per unit (plus freight). After expanding the scope of allocation to include the moderately and marginally poor, the total allocation volume has increased from 180,000 dan per period to 280,000 dan. The government must subsidize 300,000 yuan per dan on average, so the People's Food Allocation Committee loses more than 100 billion yuan each month. The total number of destitute, moderately poor, and marginally poor in the city is approximately 400,000. Those who are hidden poor can directly apply to the Allocation Committee in writing for rice, and Director Wu stated that approval will be granted with sympathy.

### Principal and Female Students in Court; Jiang Ruzhen States Two Reasons, Declares No Bestial Conduct

[Report from our Newspaper] Jiang Ruzhen, the principal of the private Huade Elementary School at No. 64 West Warehouse Road in this city, was accused of repeatedly raping Zhu Yuexian, a 13-year-old female student at the school, and Zhang Juying and others. After the incident, Jiang fled to Jiangyin but was arrested and brought to justice. He was tried in the First Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday morning. Presiding Judge Meng first interrogated Jiang Ruzhen, who was wearing a gray cloth short shirt and pants, with slightly gray hair, tightly biting his lower lip, and occasionally displaying a ferocious smile. He stated, "I am 55 years old, from Jiangyin, and have been the principal of Huade for eight years. Zhu Yuexian and Zhang Juying are both third-grade students and live next door to me." Judge Meng asked if it was true that he had called Zhu Yuexian upstairs in March of last year under the pretext of tutoring and raped her. Jiang flatly denied it. Zhu Yuexian suddenly shouted from the witness stand, "You're lying!" causing everyone in the audience to turn their heads. The court then questioned the defendant, asking if he admitted to raping Zhang Juying in June of this year. Jiang repeatedly denied it, saying, "If there were such a thing, I would be simply a beast." Zhu Yuexian then testified, stating that on a certain day in March of last year, at around 7:00 AM, she and another female student, Zhou Changming, were both raped by Jiang, and that Jiang threatened them afterward not to reveal it, or he would beat them to death. She added that on the morning of June 2nd of this year, at around 7:00 AM, she was raped again and finally told her mother, who reported it to the police. Zhang Juying stated, "On a certain morning in June of last year, at around 9:00 AM, Jiang called me upstairs under the pretext of tutoring in Chinese and raped me. After Zhu Yuexian reported it to the police this year, I told my mother, and we went to the Municipal Hospital for examination." At this point, the court asked Jiang if he admitted it. Jiang shook his head to deny it. The court asked, "Then why did they accuse you?" Jiang replied, "It's a long story. Zhu Yuexian's mother is my neighbor, and I often go to her house to play cards. On February 1st of this year, Zhu's mother borrowed 2 million yuan from me and has not repaid it. After I repeatedly demanded repayment, she ordered Zhu Yuexian to call me to collect it on May 29th. When I reached the alley entrance, I was met by a dozen thugs who asked me why I often took female students to the City God Temple, and said that someone said I was engaging in improper conduct. They demanded 5 million yuan from me, and I discussed it with Zhu Changgui, the owner of a funeral shop. Unexpectedly, Zhu colluded with Zhu Yuexian's mother and reported me to the police." Zhu Yuexian's mother, Zhu Hu Maozhu, said, "After I found out about this, I immediately questioned Jiang the next day, asking what he was doing calling Yuexian upstairs and closing the door. Jiang did not answer and after ten minutes said: Zhu, my teacher, please forgive me. I hate it so I went forward and slapped him once, he asked me not to be angry and sit down, and then I stepped forward and slapped him a second time, before taking Yuexian to the hospital for testing, then to the Penglai Police Station. As for Jiang saying that I had an illicit relationship with him, it is completely untrue." Jiang made two final defenses: Given my age and status, I would not do such a thing. There are older girls and female teachers in my school, aged seventeen or eighteen to over twenty, and if I were to consider such a thing, I would not consider a thirteen-year-old girl. The court ordered that the case be reheard on a later date.

### Autumn Season; Visiting Two Silk Factories in Chang'an

[Report from our Correspondent in Hangzhou, October 10th] Chang'an is located in a strategic position on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line. It has two silk factories, Chang'an and Lianyuan. I had the opportunity to visit them. The Chang'an Silk Factory has 192 silk reeling machines, most of which are the multi-strand type from 1925. There are also cocoon making machines of the Chiba type, two generators, one using kerosene as fuel with 32 horsepower, and one using coal as fuel with 28 horsepower. Each batch produces three and a half dan of silk. There are more than 500 workers, with more female workers than male workers. They also have an inspection room, using black leather boards and electric light to illuminate the silk's uniformity and whether it has knots. In their factory, there is also an old-fashioned sitting reeling machine. The air is relatively poor, with water vapor and the smell of silkworms mingling, making it very uncomfortable. There is also a re-reeling machine, which re-reels the reeled silk, and a sorting room where the silk is made into skeins. A simple machine is used here, which is also made in Japan. There is also a selection process, where a machine is used to remove the fluff from the cocoons and select the good cocoons. But it is said that this machine is also made in Japan. After being made into skeins, they are made into bundles. Each small bundle has thirty skeins, also called thirty pieces, and each piece has thirty small bundles, with each piece equivalent to one guan dan.

Government Loans for Cocoon Purchasing

According to the person in charge of the factory, the government lends us money to buy cocoons. After the cocoons are bought, they are reeled into silk, and the silk is handed over to the government, which exports it to foreign countries to compete in the market. Recently, our exports of silkworm silk seem to have revived somewhat, so silk prices have been relatively high recently. However, silk factories can only obtain some operating expenses, at most only 10-20%. The factory is naturally not satisfied. The person in charge of the factory said, "The factory's expenses are also very high."

Rotary vs. Chiba and Others

I went on to visit the Lianyuan Silk Factory. The Lianyuan Factory has 180 machines, with 36 new rotary machines and 134 fixed cocoon reeling machines of the Chiba type like those at the Chang'an Silk Factory. The so-called rotary machine randomly places the cocoons in the water onto the needle hooks, and they will be reeled. This is different from the fixed ones, which require the cocoon silk to be placed on a certain needle hook before it can be reeled. The rotary type saves much more time, and the work efficiency is naturally much higher. Currently, the most modern silk reeling machine in this factory can be operated by one person for ten hooks, but there is a new type in Japan that can be operated by one person for forty hooks, making its manufacturing efficiency twice as high as ours.

Collecting Handling Fees

All other machines and processes at the Lianyuan Factory are the same as those at the Chang'an Factory, but it lacks an inspection process. If we want to sell our silk abroad, this inspection process is indispensable. They have a generator of 60 kilowatts. They can also produce three dan of silk per day. The government also lends money to buy cocoons, which the factory then buys to reel into silk. After the silk is reeled, it is handed over to the state for foreign trade, and some handling fees are collected in the process.

Lack of Competitive Interest

Both of the above silk factories are privately owned and operated by shareholders. Speaking in terms of Zhejiang Province, the scale is not too small, but I asked them if they could fund their own cocoon purchases. They said, "Currently, each dan of cocoons costs more than 1 million yuan, and our capital is not enough to meet the demand. However, if the government always lends money to silk factories to buy cocoons, and the silk factories only receive a small handling fee after reeling the silk, then the quality of the product will decrease, and the seriousness of the work will also decrease." These few words can at least be used as a reference for the government. The government originally intended to attract foreign exchange and rectify the silk products, so it did this. This approach can prevent cocoon merchants from profiting from it and prevent silk merchants from exploiting it and damaging international reputation with inferior products, which can be said to be relatively reasonable. However, the government should reward the silk factories for their products and work efficiency to encourage them to have competitive interests.

Need to Create Ourselves

I see that both of these factories are using Japanese machines. Originally, our country had a silk market in the international community very early on. At that time, there were no Japanese silk prices, only Chinese silk prices. Unfortunately, our predecessors did not do well, so that the international community valued Japanese silk instead of our country's silk prices. We cannot blame fate, the Japanese bury their heads in research, and we abandon ourselves. From today on, we must research and create ourselves, and never rely on others again. We must also invent our own silk reeling machines and cocoon making machines.

Approved Cocoon Purchase Prices

The autumn cocoons are about to be harvested, and the government lends each factory 1.08 million yuan per dan. According to factory personnel, farmers are willing to sell only at 1.8 million yuan per dan, otherwise, they prefer to make native silk. I asked about the outlet for native silk, and they told the reporter that native silk can be sent to silk shops to weave silk. In any case, in order to encourage the silk cocoon industry, the government should conduct a clear investigation into the raw material production areas of the silk cocoon industry. Facts are facts, and should not rely on reports, let alone fabricate them themselves. They should formulate cocoon purchase prices based on statistics so that this year's autumn silk can show a new face in the international market! (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Teachers in Various Schools in Taiwan Inherit the Old System of Official Titles from the Japanese Colonial Period; They Recently Requested the Education Department to Change to the National Official System

[Our Newspaper Taipei Fifteenth Dispatch] During the Japanese colonial period, teachers in various schools in Taiwan were appointed by the supervising officials with the official ranks of "Fu-nin," "So-nin," and "Han-nin" respectively.

The Education Department believes that this matter is of great importance and cannot be decided arbitrarily, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Education for instructions.

### A Report with the Spirit of the Times; The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and China (Continued from Yesterday)

As of October this year, 9,000 copies of Chinese scientific periodicals have been donated, with 25 volumes per copy, totaling 222,500 volumes, as well as 5,000 pictures, and 472 books and pamphlets. Recently, it was also discussed to send educational film machines to various countries, and it has been decided to donate two machines to China. It is also under discussion to send French art works, and it will be decided how many copies will be donated to China. However, the library group has extremely high expectations for China. Firstly, in order to understand the current situation and needs of libraries in various UNESCO member countries for the purpose of relief and donation, it issued the first survey form of 250 copies to the Chinese Ministry of Education in March of this year, asking them to forward it to various medical libraries and educational and academic institutions, and directly sent 166 copies of this survey form to various libraries and universities in China. To this day, only 26 copies of this survey form have been filled out and returned to the library group, which is too few and detrimental to China. Secondly, UNESCO has printed two publications related to libraries. After the first issue was published, 250 copies were sent to the Chinese Ministry of Education in April of this year, asking them to distribute it (125 copies were sent by airmail, and the other half by ordinary mail). The number of 250 copies is far from enough for the vast national, provincial, municipal, and private schools and all medical libraries in China. It is hoped to obtain the addresses of various libraries in China in order to directly contact them, and it is hoped that libraries in various parts of China, for their own benefit, will directly establish contact with the UNESCO library group.

The summer camp for international teachers on the application of taxation was a project of the International Education Understanding Group. It was held from July 20 to August 30, a total of six weeks, at the Ecole Normale in Sèvres, near Paris. Thirty-one countries participated, with a total of eighty teachers. China's participation included one instructor, Zhou Lin, hired by the teachers' camp, and seven teachers, five men and two women: Ling Shuhua (Mrs. Chen Yuan), Zhang Bianhe (female student majoring in education at the University of Geneva), Xu Jizu (President of Kunming Education College), Tang Shifang (Director of the Education Department of Sichuan Province), Song Dalu (Secretary of the Education Department of Sichuan Province), Zhen Chui (lecturer at the University of London), and Zhang Zhilian (Vice Principal of Guanghua Middle School in Shanghai). Xu Mo, Wu Jingxiong, and Yan Yangchu were also invited to the camp to give lectures (Hu Shize was also invited, but did not make it due to other commitments).

The Far East Regional Council of Churches conference was held in Nanjing from September 3 to 12. Reports on this conference in China have already been very detailed and need not be repeated.

As for the Natural Science Group, Mr. Jan Smid was dispatched to leave Paris for China on October 3 to establish a Far East Regional Natural Science Cooperation Office in Nanjing.

Next, the various international conferences held within UNESCO. For example, at the International Conference of Drama Experts, China originally invited Yu Shangyuan to attend, but Yu could not make it, and Xie Shoukang, who was in Paris at the time, attended temporarily. It was decided to establish an International Drama Academy, and China was elected as one of the preparatory committee members. As for the conference on the needs of the news industry, radio, and film materials in war-affected countries, China's representative was Feng Shang. It was decided that five million US dollars worth of newsprint should be used to relieve China, France, and the Netherlands. It was also decided that China should have at least 18 million radio receivers, train 300 experts, and apply 900,000 broadcast machines in schools. It was also decided that the film relief fund should be between 20 million and 25 million US dollars, 10% of which should be used for developing feature films and 90% for making educational films. It was determined that China was one of the countries most in need of relief. It was also decided to establish an International Journalism Academy in Paris, with an estimated annual cost of 200,000 to 250,000 US dollars. This amount will be provided in part by UNESCO and in part by donations from various member states. These resolutions will be submitted to the second annual conference to be held in Mexico for final decision. Also, at the Philosophy and Humanities Conference, China had Luo Zhongshu, the philosophical advisor in UNESCO, and Tao Menghe, who arrived temporarily to attend. Their work and opinions were noticed and welcomed by various countries. (To be continued)

### Current Situation of the Expedition Team; Obvious Progress in Performance

[Our Newspaper Special Article] From the charity basketball game last night, we saw the current situation of the "Expedition Team". Compared with the situation when they came to Shanghai in May this year, there has been much progress.

The current "Expedition Team" is obviously different. They already know [missing information], and they are turning the limited [missing information] to the lowest limit. Last night, they defeated the Shantou team easily. [missing information]'s [missing information], most of the breakthroughs were slammed in, and the [missing information] has gradually gotten on track. The reason for being able to defeat Shantou easily is due to these points.

In general, the "Expedition Team" has become a stable, organized, and intelligent traveling team, while still maintaining the speed and accuracy of shooting. Therefore, the "Expedition Team" has made progress. In terms of personnel, Gan [missing information] has replaced Li Wenning's position and has become the main general in scoring and [missing information]. He is the most continuous scorer in the "Expedition Team".

The defeat of the oil team cannot be simply attributed to "luck". When attacking, although the oil team can make full use of [missing information] tactics, they still lack [missing information], while the "Expedition Team" guards [missing information] and is full of color. Chang Bo prevented the Shantou [missing information] from breaking through the last barrier. The Shantou team has always relied on Lin [missing information] and Chen Qingjiang for points. In yesterday's game, Chen Qingjiang was abnormal, and Lin's 45-degree angle mid-range shot, although the angle has been widened, lost its accuracy, which is also a reason for the failure. The progress of the "Expedition Team" gives the "Hua Lian" a major threat. (Changnian)

### Under Strict Supervision by the Authorities, Rice, Flour, and Oil Prices Begin to Fall, Industry Insiders Hope to Streamline Sources and Incentivize Transportation

The military authorities in this city are using forceful measures to suppress prices and investigate individuals hoarding and manipulating the market. The public is feeling insecure and is selling off goods. Yesterday, prices of various commodities generally fell. A total of more than 12,000 dan of rice and grain arrived in the northern and southern markets, and the market was filled with selling pressure. Prices of all grains fell across the board. Medium-grade white japonica rice fell by 350,000 yuan, indica rice fell by 340,000 yuan, and Baiyuan rice fell by 230,000 yuan. Flour sales were sluggish, with supply exceeding demand, and prices fell by 20,000 yuan, while bran fell by over 10,000 yuan. Transactions in the edible oil market were sparse, with only a very small number of transactions between oil firms. Oil factories' asking prices were largely ignored by major buyers. On the same day, Lou Sheng oil was priced at 2,100,000 yuan (previously as high as 2,300,000 yuan), soybean oil at 2,000,000 yuan (previously as high as 2,250,000 yuan), raw rapeseed oil at 1,650,000 yuan (previously as high as 1,900,000 yuan), cooked rapeseed oil at 1,400,000 yuan (previously as high as 1,600,000 yuan), and raw sesame oil at 1,900,000 yuan (previously as high as 2,150,000 yuan). Raw materials also showed the same trend, with raw peanuts falling from 1,010,000 yuan to 900,000 yuan, and soybeans falling from 440,000 yuan to 390,000 yuan. Sesame seeds fell from 820,000 yuan to 770,000 yuan. According to relevant sources, if this trend can continue, it will be beneficial to the people's welfare. Otherwise, it will be necessary to increase production and massively sell off goods to suppress oil prices. Regarding the former, the China Industrial and Mining Corporation (CITC) has already taken it into account. President Zhang of the National Bank has recently approved a large sum to be entrusted to the Third District Oil Factory Association to purchase raw materials for the second time from the production areas. It is expected that in the short term, daily production of soybean, rapeseed, and sesame oil will reach 10,000 dan each. Regarding the latter, the municipal government has decided that the China Edible Oil Company should quickly transport 10,000 dan of raw oil from Qingdao to Shanghai, and cooperate with the Zhongzhi factory to maintain daily rationing.

Responsible Person of Southern Market Analyzes the Reasons for Recent Rice Price Fluctuations

The soaring rice prices in recent days are a great threat to people's livelihood. The responsible person of the Southern Market Rice Industry Market issued a statement saying that the reasons for the fluctuations in rice prices in this city are as follows: The substantial increase in prices of public utilities and the drastic fluctuations in other commodity prices. The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan are frequently raising prices due to the impact of borrowing and taxation. The authorities are purchasing goods in the Wuhu area at market prices. The provinces of Hunan and Jiangxi have banned exports. The business tax on food grains has not been waived. A small number of citizens are protecting the value of currency and making efforts to purchase and store goods. The rice purchased by the grain merchants in this city has not yet arrived. We hope that the authorities, under the principle of not harming farmers or afflicting the people, will quickly coordinate a comprehensive, practical, and effective solution so that grain merchants have something to follow. In addition, we hope that the following points will be selected and listed: Streamline the sources of goods and facilitate transportation. Waive taxes and encourage transportation (such as the business tax levied on one item multiple times should not be levied). Restore agricultural loans and handle mortgages. Sell off public grain to stabilize public sentiment. Accelerate rationing and follow through on promises.

### Market Filled with Calls to Sell, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Continue Downtrend, 42-Count Blue Phoenix Down 3 Million Compared to Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was such that, due to the authorities' thorough investigation of warehouses and yarn factories' account books, people were even more timid. Furthermore, with tight monetary conditions, many scattered small sellers were cutting prices to sell, and the asking prices for various yarns fell. The final asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix was 32.5 million yuan, a further drop of 3 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse was down by 1.1 million yuan, 16-count Guangming was down by 1.3 million yuan, and other yarns of various counts were also down by 1 million to 2.3 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market was also affected by the authorities' determination to suppress commodity prices, and the guild was instructed to order its members to register within a time limit. Furthermore, yesterday's supply of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth by the Fangxiong Company was uniformly allocated to applicants according to their requests, ensuring sufficient supply. With continued large transfers into banks and a tight monetary policy, public sentiment was weak, and the market was filled with calls to sell. Prices for various cloths declined across the board. The final price for Dragon Head fine cloth fell to 820,000 yuan, a further drop of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other various fine cloths, such as serge and twill, also fell by 40,000 to 70,000 or 80,000 yuan.

The rise and fall of the rayon market were rapid. In two days, it fell by nearly 20 million yuan. Yesterday morning, the opening price for 120 count Asahi rayon was between 77 and 78 million yuan.

In the afternoon, the discussion started regarding the actual quota needed by each public association in each city, but no conclusion was reached. It will be continued this morning.

Factory Silk: The market was quite quiet yesterday. No transactions were heard in the morning.

Another batch of 7 or 8 dan was traded, with high grade costing 67 million to 7.5 million yuan. Gan silk high grade was priced at around 48 million yuan.

### After the Announcement of Measures for Handling Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Materials, Various Reactions

[Reported by This Newspaper] Ji Chaoding, Director of the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, issued a statement yesterday regarding the government's decision on the measures for handling goods arriving in Shanghai with self-provided foreign exchange, as follows: After the Import and Export Control Commission issued an announcement on August 21, stipulating that all goods that had already been shipped and were en route before August 16 of this year, but had not yet obtained an import permit, must be registered within a limited time, the issue of handling goods arriving at the port and shipped with self-provided foreign exchange without a permit arose. Now, the measures for handling this issue have been approved by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 14th. In the current environment of managing trade and foreign exchange, in my personal opinion, this measure has taken all aspects into account and is well-considered. However, the government must avoid allowing goods to fall into the hands of hoarders when allocating and purchasing materials in the future. If the raw materials and equipment allocated to the industrial sector can be truly used for production, then at this time of material scarcity, the injection of a large amount of materials into the market can benefit both production and consumption.

Importers and Exporters Say It Will Affect Prices

[Reported by This Newspaper] After the government decided to purchase imported goods with self-provided foreign exchange, the reporter specifically interviewed Zhang Yaozhang, Chairman of the Importers and Exporters Association, to inquire about his opinion. According to him: "Importers and exporters have already exchanged opinions on this matter and will make concrete representations to the government in the future. I personally believe that the government's decision on the purchase measures is far from what the relevant authorities have said to importers and exporters in the past. From the government's point of view, the purchase measures have three benefits: The government can control a large amount of materials and reduce currency issuance. The foreign exchange required for the next quota allocation can be saved because there is a large amount of imported materials on hand. Under the current purchase measures, the government can obtain significant profits. However, if merchants are unwilling to have their funds frozen for three years and re-export the goods, then in today's economic crisis, it will definitely have a negative impact on prices."

### Textile Adjustment Committee Decides on Two Principles for Implementing Joint Cotton Price Negotiation

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened its 14th regular meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Liu Siying reported on three points: The recent implementation of price negotiation and joint distribution. Implementing joint price negotiation in cotton markets in various locations to avoid fluctuations in the cotton market. Measures for handling the registration of yarn and cloth inventory.

It is heard that the joint cotton price negotiation will be jointly negotiated by the Textile Construction, private factories, the Farmers Bank of China, and cotton merchants. The two principles are: Protecting the legitimate profits of cotton farmers. Do not rush to buy cotton to avoid unreasonable fluctuations in the cotton market.

Six District Cotton Textile Guild to Assist in Inspecting Yarn Factories

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Six District Cotton Textile Guild held its 27th board meeting at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. The agenda items discussed included: The Textile Adjustment Committee's notification to inspect the purchase, sale, transportation, and storage of cotton yarn in the city's yarn factories and yarn shops, requesting that staff be dispatched to assist in the case. It was resolved that the guild would send staff to participate. During the meeting, the members exchanged opinions on the conversation with the three members of the National Economic Commission and Minister Chen, and they hoped that the government would import as much foreign cotton as possible, the government would do its best to assist in various production conditions, and the Textile Adjustment Committee would continue to implement a flexible price negotiation system.

In addition, the Six District Cotton Textile Guild notified its member factories yesterday that the contract period for the "Industry and Trade Bureau's" cotton allocation has been agreed upon. Shanghai factories can contact Manager Sun Dehe at the Industry and Trade Bureau to negotiate and sign contracts from now until the 17th of this month, and factories in other cities have until the 20th of this month.

### Yarn and Cloth Easily Exchanged for Indian Cotton, Key Points of the Agreed Upon Measures

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee's Yarn and Cloth Export Committee held a meeting at the National Bank at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Shen Xirui. After discussion, the key points of the resolution on the issue of yarn and cloth exports easily exchanged for Indian cotton are: One-tenth of each factory's yarn and cloth exports can be exchanged for Indian cotton. In order to facilitate foreign exchange accounting, it was decided to ask HSBC, Citibank, and the Bank of China to serve as intermediaries. The export standards of each factory's yarn and cloth must be carefully inspected. The yarn and cloth exported by each factory must first be approved by the Export Committee. In order to handle the approval matters, the Export Committee has set up a business office within the Textile Construction Company to handle the approval matters concurrently. The Central Bank will first advance a sum of funds to purchase Indian cotton and distribute it to each factory to spin yarn and weave cloth, which will be continuously exported and exchanged for cotton.

### China Stocks Weak in the Morning, Rebound at the Close

News that Chinese stocks would be used to purchase goods imported with private funds caused panic among various sensitive players. Many in the industry wound up their businesses one after another. For the most part, the situation was progressively weakening. The market did not improve in the morning, but later, with the help of rumors of large banknotes, the National Bank intervened, and the low after the rebound rose.

The morning opened with the US and Asia stocks rising sharply. However, the rest of the shares also rose slightly. There were many selling actions after the opening, and the Yongxin Yarn share dropped to 321 yuan and 322 yuan. Although there was a slight increase midway, the interest rate outside the market opened high to 24 cents and 28.5 cents. The Xin Ya share price dropped from 146 to the limit of the decline. After 10:30, it stepped down again to 316 yuan and 318 yuan. Following this, it dropped further to 313 yuan for immediate delivery and 315 yuan for forward delivery. Nos. 24 and 76 stock were purchased at the close, and Yongxin Yarn shares closed at 315 yuan and 317 yuan. It was slightly weak after the close. As a result, in comparison with previous closing price, Xin Ya shares fell to the limit of its decline, Zhabei fell by half, Huochai and Zhongfa fell by 10 percent. Yongxin, Meiya, Liangfu, Xinhua, Lihua, Lianan, Rongfeng and Tongyi fell by half, Xinyi rose slightly and the remaining fell slightly. Looking at deferred delivery shares, Xinyi and Huasheng were slightly firmer, Yongxin, Meiya, Xinguang and Jingfu each fell by half.

In the afternoon, only immediate delivery transactions took place. Yongxin shares were first sold to 311 yuan, but Meiya was strongly supported by No. 4 etc., and the price was quickly raised. There were many suppliers of Yongxin shares, pushing the price down to 310 yuan. Subsequently, the National Bank's exchange situation spread around and was erratic. When the National Bank only intervened with more than 20 billion, public sentiment rebounded and rumors of large banknotes drove up buying interest and prices rebounded sharply. Yongxin shares rose to close at 325 yuan. Meiya shares rose even more sharply. Xinyi and the remaining shares also rose to close at high levels. As a result, compared with the closing price in the morning, Yongxin, Xinyi, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, Xinhua, Xinyi, Huaxin, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Huochai, and Xinhua rose slightly, Zhongfang, Cement, Nei Yi, and Hengfeng were flat, Zhongfa, Lianan, and Jinglun rose by half. Meiya, Zhongsi, and Zhabei each rose by 10 percent. The prices of old shares on the market, apart from bank shares, fell back.

Qinxing Shirt and Socks' capital increase has been completed and trading will resume today. Immediate delivery and deferred delivery will be offered at the same time. The trading unit is set at 100,000 shares.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Shares Fall

The decline in government bonds was slightly stronger yesterday, with the greatest decline in the Unified E bond. Although Room 555 was buying, Room 553 was selling, with a turnover of about 4 million. The Unified C bond opened in the morning at 17,400 yuan, rose from 17,500 yuan, and then decreased to 16,000 yuan before leveling off slightly. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, A and B bonds were lower by 700 yuan, C bonds fell by 900 yuan, Unified D fell by 800 yuan, and Unified E fell by 1,400.

Yesterday, the selling pressure of foreign shares was stronger, with securities firms and foreign firms supplying, and only Guangdong firms were buying slightly. Yisha opened in the morning at 181,000 yuan, and fell from 186,000 yuan to close at 180,000 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Jardine Matheson, Paper, and Steel each fell by half, Yeguang was flat, and the rest all fell slightly.

### Large Pieces of Dried Longan Expensive

Large pieces of dried longan have been out of stock for two weeks, and the inventory is empty. Yesterday, a small amount of foreign goods opened, and the firms regarded it as a scarce commodity, raising prices by more than 30%. Due to this volatility, the prices of lower-grade goods have also followed closely.

### The Sugar Market Is Firm and Stable

Yesterday's sugar market was firm and stable because it had been rising for several days in a row, and the guild had stopped trading for one day the day before yesterday to ease the market. The market has now slightly eased, but it is still firm and stable. The guild's allocation of goods and sorting out of 20 medium-grade sand white sugar was initially 1.12 million yuan, and later reduced to 1.1 million yuan. The 36th-term warehouse receipt for 24 rough white sugar was a maximum of 1.16 million yuan and a minimum of 1,100,800 yuan. Shantou Blue was 97 to 8 million yuan, and cotton red was 1 million yuan. Another Xing Diao Blue opened at 945,000 yuan, and the same trade allocated 945,000 yuan, with occasional concessions, and the price was lower. Hainan Red was 1 million yuan, and the high-quality Xinghua white bagged sugar was 1.18 million yuan to 120,000 yuan, and the next grade was 1.08 million yuan. Packaged was 1,050,000 yuan. Xing Red was 1,035,000 yuan, and the next grade was between 1 million yuan and 1.18 million yuan. A total of 1,3400 pieces were traded.

### Review of Chinese Geography Textbook Maps

— Yi Zhong

(Compiled by Yang Jingxiong and Chu Shaotang, published by Xin Zhong Yu Di Xue She, first edition in September of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947])

Maps are a fundamental tool for geography teaching, which is self-evident. Therefore, today, the publication of maps by Yu Di Xue She (Geographical Society) is flourishing. Moreover, due to the different levels of map readers, the compilation of national maps has been divided into those suitable for universities, high schools, and primary schools to meet the needs.

There are many maps suitable for junior high and primary schools currently available, but very few are well-compiled, which is regrettable. Recently, I saw the Chinese Geography Textbook Maps for primary and secondary schools published by Xin Zhong Yu Di Xue She, compiled by Mr. Yang Jingxiong and Mr. Chu Shaotang. I took the time to read it through and, in my humble opinion, felt that there were many aspects of the map that needed discussion. I will list them below, despite my limited knowledge:

The political map should include as many provincial-level cities as possible, but the current map is missing cities such as Tangshan, Jinzhou, Anshan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Changhua, Chiayi, and Pingtung.

On the topographic map, the name of the "Profile Map from the Guangdong-Guangxi Plain to Taiwan" mistranscribes Xiuguluan Mountain as Touguluan Mountain.

On the topographic map, there is no river connecting the Yangtze River and the Huai River east of Dabie Mountain (except for the canal), but the map shows a river connecting the Yangtze River and the Huai River. I don't know what this means!

The aluminum in Xiuwen, Guiyang, and Kunming, and the magnesite and talc mines in Haicheng and Gaiping are all major resources in our country. They should be included on the mineral map, but the current map omits them.

As for transportation, it is indeed difficult to be completely accurate. The following are some errors on this map:

From Donghai in Jiangsu to Henan, in addition to the Xuzhou-Lanzhou Railway, there is also the Haizheng Highway, which runs from Donghai through Suqian and Xuzhou to Zhengzhou. The highway between Suqian and Xuzhou was completed long ago and has already been seen on the national economic commission's seven-province (Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan) connecting highway route map. Other maps have added this route, but this map still omits it.

From Xiashi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, there are two highways: one runs north to connect the highway between Jiaxing and Changan, and the other runs south to connect the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. This highway was completed before the victory and has been reported in Zhejiang newspapers many times, but it is also missing from this map.

The terminus of the Xiangqian Railway is Lantian, but the map mistakenly marks it as Dajiangkou. See Zhang Jiaji's "Construction of Chinese Railways." Also, the railway between Lengshuitan and Lingling on the Xianggui Railway is missing from the map.

The Lesi Highway between Leshan and Xichang in Sichuan Province is not included, as seen in Jiang Junzhang's "Southwest Economic Geography" and the "Second National Government Yearbook."

The highway between Anlong and Badu in Guizhou Province is missing, as seen in the "Second National Government Yearbook." The highway between Songtao and Tongren in Guizhou is missing.

The highway between Xianfeng and Laifeng in Hubei Province is missing, as seen in the same source.

The Xukun Railway was opened to Qujing in the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], and then reconnected to the Yunnan-Burma Road and extended to Zhanyi, but the terminus of the map is still marked at Qujing. See the "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled by the Ministry of Transportation in April of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946]. Also, the Yunnan-Burma Railway between Kunming and Anning is missing.

The railway between Fenghuang on the Xianggui Railway and Dajian on the Qianjiang River is missing, as seen in the same source and the "Second National Government Yearbook."

The southern section of the Xianggui Railway between Zhennanguan and Ningming is missing, as seen in the "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled by the Ministry of Transportation.

On the Taiwan map, the road from Pingtung to Fangliao only extends to Linbian now, not to Fangliao, as seen in the "Taiwan Transportation No. 1" compiled by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Governor's Office Transportation Department in the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946].

On the Shanxi Province map, the railway line from Baigui to Jincheng has only completed the Baigui-Changzhi section. The map mistakenly marks the Changzhi-Jincheng section as a completed railway, which is incorrect. See the "Overview of Transportation in the Past Fifteen Years" compiled by the Ministry of Transportation and Zhang Jiaji's "Construction of Chinese Railways."

The railway between Xiaoxie on the Pinghan Railway and Kaifeng is missing, as seen in the same source.

On the Shaanxi Province map, the highway between Ankang and Baihe has been completed, but the map mistakenly marks it as an incomplete road, which is incorrect. See the "Northwest Highway Route Map" in the Shen Bao's local news section.

There is a highway from Tianshui running northwest through Tongwei to Cuijialing. This road, which is part of the Cui Shuang Highway, has been completed for a long time and has been reported in newspapers and magazines many times. Other maps have this line, but this map is still missing it.

The railway between Nencheng and Aigun has been completed for a long time, but this map still marks it as an incomplete railway. See Zhang's "Construction of Chinese Railways."

The Guilin-Sansui Highway is missing from the map, as seen in the "Second National Government Yearbook."

On the Taiwan map, in addition to the line parallel to the railway between Keelung and Taipei, there is another highway that goes around Datun Mountain to Taipei. Other maps have this line, but this map is missing it. See the "Taiwan Statistical Map" compiled by the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office Statistics Office. Also, the Pingtung map of the province shows a highway extending to Meihe in the south and connecting to the Taitung Highway. I don't know when this highway was completed, and its basis is also unclear.

On the Taiwan map, there is a railway from Sandiaoling to Shintongkeng, but this map marks the terminus of the railway at Pingxi, east of Qingtongkeng, which is incorrect.

In addition to transportation, I have also found errors in county seats and other aspects, which I will point out to conclude this article.

Wuchang County in Hubei has been moved to Jinkou, but this map is missing it. Tongguan in Shaanxi has been renamed Yaichuan, but this map mistakenly marks it as Tongchuan.

Zhejiang originally had 76 counties, but after the newly established Wencheng County, it should be changed to 77 counties, but the appendix of this map still lists it as 76 counties.

Because the wind direction is parallel to the coastline in the eastern coastal area of Zhejiang, there are fewer opportunities for rainfall in Ningbo. For example, the annual rainfall in Suian in the west reaches 1826 mm, and Jiande reaches 1416 mm, while Beiyushan on the coast is only 1159 mm. It can be seen that the rainfall distribution in Zhejiang has a trend of decreasing from west to east, which is by no means as stated in the appendix, "the rainfall is the heaviest along the coast."

On the Gansu Province map, the Bailong River has a tributary called the Min River near Xigu, which belongs to the Yangtze River system. However, this map only shows its upper and lower reaches and does not show the middle reaches. It also mistakenly marks it as a tributary of the Tao River, which is incorrect. See Li Xudan's "Geographical Observation of the Life in the Upper Reaches of the Bailong River," "Geographical Journal," Volume 8.

### Revised History of the Chinese Constitution

— Chu Yukun

Written by Chen Ruxuan, published by The World Book Co., priced at 14 National Currency, total 458 pages

Ten years ago, when I was collecting materials and referring to famous constitutional works to compile "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution," I often referred to Mr. Chen Ruxuan's "History of the Chinese Constitution." When I wrote "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution," I believed that after the publication of this work, China could finally enter a constitutional period. Unexpectedly, when "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution" was displayed in the windows of the Zhonghua Book Company, not only was there no hope of holding the National Assembly, originally scheduled for November 12th of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], but the whole of China was already at war.

From then on, what the entire nation strived for was the victory of the war and the liberation of the nation, while political democratization receded to a secondary position. During the war, the government also made great efforts to ensure that politics conformed to the democratic path. For the sake of gathering ideas widely, it established the National Political Council to allow the people's opinions to be heard. However, China could not truly enter a constitutional period until after the victory of the war. Therefore, writings on constitutionalism were ignored by the general public. In particular, Mr. Chen's "History of the Chinese Constitution" and my "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution," when issued in Shanghai, were subjected to inspection by the Japanese military police, who regarded them as banned books and prohibited their sale. Therefore, the first edition was not completely sold out.

After the victory of the war, Chinese politics underwent eight or nine years of evolution, and the historical facts recorded in the book needed to be augmented. I had long wanted to revise and augment "An Outline of the Chinese Constitution" and reissue it, but because I worked in the news industry and wrote editorials for several newspapers, I hardly had time to reorganize the old work. The day before yesterday, Brother Ye Qiuyuan sent me Mr. Chen's "Revised History of the Chinese Constitution," which on the one hand made me feel ashamed, and on the other hand gave me encouragement that I should take the time to reorganize the old work.

The feature of the "Revised History of the Chinese Constitution" lies in its last two chapters: one is the constitutional movement during the war and the opinions of various parties on the draft constitution, which not only explains the relationship between the war and constitutionalism, but also raises the issue of ending party rule, and also records the nationwide movement to study the draft constitution. Finally, the political consultative council's advocacy for the constitution is also collected in this unit. The second is the completion and implementation of the constitution. This chapter can be said to be the constitutional history of the last year. The first section is the final twists and turns in convening the National Assembly. The political consultative council originally scheduled the National Assembly to be held on May 5, but it was postponed because the parties first fought for seats and then refused to submit a list of names. It finally opened on November 15, but the Communist Party and the Democratic League did not participate. The second section is the draft constitution of the political consultative council, which was first submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and amendment. Mr. Chen is a member of the Legislative Yuan and personally participated in the discussion of the draft constitution, so he knows the merits and demerits of the draft constitution of the political consultative council. Therefore, in the third section, the review of the draft constitutional amendment, he put forward many valuable opinions. In particular, he listed the differences between the formal constitution and the draft of the political consultative council to clarify them, which is most clear.

Mr. Chen said in the conclusion, "Our country's constitutional movement, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present, for more than 40 years, until January of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], this major law that the whole country has been looking forward to for a century was finally completed and promulgated. The time spent and the effort made can be said to have broken the world record for constitution-making. It was very difficult to obtain, and it must be carefully protected and vigorously implemented. This is why I am happy to see the dawn coming after a long night for the future of constitutionalism in our country." In short, Mr. Chen's "History of the Chinese Constitution" is worth reading. It is specially introduced to readers who care about Chinese constitutionalism. This book is really a must-read. It is of great benefit to understanding the actual situation of Chinese constitutionalism.

### "My Life"

— Tuan Ni

Author: Chiang Ching-kuo

Publication Date: April, the 36th year of the Republic [i.e., 1947]

Publisher: Qian Feng Publishing House

This is a concrete and realistic account of Mr. Chiang's three-year plan to create and build a new Southern Jiangxi when he served as the Fourth Administrative Commissioner, that is, the scene at the county magistrate meeting of the Fourth Administrative Region, which decided the critical issue of building a new Southern Jiangxi, on July 4th of the 31st year of the Republic [i.e., 1942]. He concentrated all the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of Southern Jiangxi, trained a large number of revolutionary cadres, improved the basic lives of the masses, and led the people to actively participate in the war of resistance. He cited several failed heroes in history and the reasons for their failures. Therefore, he asked everyone to show loyalty to love the country, conscience to love the people, enthusiasm to do things, and dedication to be human beings. More importantly, they need to have the determination to work hard, work stubbornly, work quickly, and work practically, and stand on the people's front with steps, plans, meanings, and purposes to jointly build a new Southern Jiangxi. The new policies he has led and implemented in the past year and a half have achieved remarkable results. However, it is still far from the ideal of the three-year plan. Mr. Chiang encouraged everyone to double their efforts in order to complete the important task of defending the new Southern Jiangxi.

In the past, everything in Southern Jiangxi was backward and corrupt. Some villagers even regarded banditry as a legitimate occupation and farming as a sideline. Murder, arson, gambling, robbery, and drug use became the daily life of some people. Some places did not communicate with the outside world. There were very few scholars. Graduates from elementary school could sit in sedan chairs and become gentry. There were men with braids and women wearing ancient Qing Dynasty costumes. These all showed the extreme conservatism of the local people. The government did not think of reforming it, and it accumulated into a common habit, to the point where it could no longer be remedied. Since these things were all done by people, it can only be changed by a new human force to transform customs. Mr. Chiang is most happy to fight in difficult places, which has finally made the new Southern Jiangxi a model for the whole country today.

The whole book has a total of eighty-five pages, about 40,000 words, all of which are concrete accounts of the administrative meetings of the Fourth Administrative Region, which can be divided into three chapters: Chapter 1: The New China I Hope For: 1. From an old man surnamed Yang on a hospital bed in the affiliated hospital of the medical research institute of Gong County, describing his rapid recovery of health after being treated and the ideal suitability of the surrounding environment, symbolizing a beautiful prospect; 2. Mr. Chiang reported the cause of the sacred war of resistance and the inevitable consequences of victory. Secondly, he analyzed in detail how to build a new Southern Jiangxi. Mr. Chiang believes that the first step is to complete local self-government, and to do it with a selfless attitude. Because only when the country has happiness can the people enjoy happiness; 3. Explain that the great new era must have new cadres with new styles to complete new tasks. Chapter 2: Revolutionary Work and Revolutionary Cadres: 1. Explain the difficulties in all aspects and ask everyone to overcome the difficulties and be determined to promote the new policies. At the same time, select and employ new, good, capable revolutionary cadres; 2. Analyze that good cadres must adopt public opinion, relieve people's suffering, accept criticism, and also use organization to train others in order to be called revolutionary warriors; 3. Ask everyone to celebrate the new tasks from today onwards and complete this plan. Chapter 3: New Cause, New Mission: After the work reports of the county magistrates, Mr. Chiang further instructed nine guidelines for administration. Secondly, he also reviewed the shortcomings of both the commissioner's office and the county government, hoping that everyone would have the courage to correct their mistakes, and also pointed out four internal crises that needed to be completely eliminated. Finally, Mr. Chiang put forward the central topic of this meeting, hoping that everyone would start a thorough discussion. This meeting had a truly decisive impact on the success or failure of building a new Southern Jiangxi.

In the two years since the victory of the War of Resistance, the flames of war have not been extinguished, poverty has not been relieved, and the people's mentality has instead formed a loose phenomenon. The enemy and puppet habits have not decreased slightly. The future is worth worrying about. Every one of our Chinese people should think of saving the country. Only by emulating Mr. Chiang's revolutionary life is it true that "things are done by people." It is people who do bad things, and it is also people who do good things. In everything, as long as we rely on determination, perseverance, and enterprising spirit, there is no reason why we cannot do well.

### Introducing "Autumn Colors on the Lakeside"

— Lin Yuwen

Author: Wang Pingling

Publisher: The Commercial Press

Price: 4 National Currency

During the war, there was a thriving literary scene, but today it is still a desolate ruin. This is naturally because life has been difficult due to the unsettled post-war period and frequent internal conflicts, which has led to a loss of writing interest among writers. Therefore, there are no decent works in the publishing world to fill the emptiness of the literary world and satisfy the readers' desires.

Fortunately, two years later, I read a collection of works full of skill - "Autumn Colors on the Lakeside." Because this book is by the hand of an old writer, Wang Pingling, who has been engaged in literature for more than 20 years, it is as if it is right for him to raise his works to the level of "Autumn Colors on the Lakeside," and it is not a shocking event in the literary world.

"Autumn Colors on the Lakeside" includes a novella and eight carefully constructed short stories. There are works that select historical themes and appropriately reflect reality: for example, "The Unmatched National Scholar" is the most familiar story of Xiao He chasing Han Xin. The author writes vividly about the scene of Liu and Xiang fighting, and gives new perspectives, depicting a group of strong men who have contributed and fought for Duke Pei, and who are unwilling to participate in the infighting between Liu and Xiang after Qin has been destroyed, adding to the suffering of the people. This meaning is quite profound. "New Pavilion Tears" uses the historical fact that Emperor Yuan of Jin called on social elites to resist the war and build the country. At that time, those heroes and chivalrous men with a heart of loyalty and a sincere heart of mutual assistance are all alive on paper, writing the situation at that time truthfully, giving an educational contrast to the figures on the political stage today.

There are three articles that use the themes of modern history: "Alas! Twelve O'Clock!" describes the decline of the Japanese Hitler - Nakano Seigō. Fortunately, this guy did not get hold of the Japanese regime, otherwise, today's geography and future history would have to be completely changed. In this short article, the author finds the ultimate cause of the disastrous defeat for the Japanese invaders, and captures a tragic copy for the ambitious warmongers. The two articles "Lu Yuan Bright Moon Night" and "Acting" write about the pitiful history of treacherous people who survived under the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders, enough to make the bandits who intend to betray the interests of the nation sweat.

As the representative of this anthology, "Autumn Colors on the Lakeside", the story takes place in the autumn of the war in West Lake. Those shameless traitors fantasized about gathering countless pure and innocent children, pretending to line up to welcome them, taking various shots, and declaring to the world, in order to prove that the enemy invaders were "loving the people like their own children." They never thought that the children of the next generation had already marked an era with themselves. The children shouted: "We are Chinese, not the sons of traitors!" The traitors tried their best to use their sons as tools to please their masters, but they could not succeed. In the end, this group of children, on the lakeside dyed by the setting sun, shone the autumn grass like blood and the lake red, made sacrifices for the Chinese nation. With the utmost reverence, the author painted with blood and tears, not forgetting a word, erected a glorious tombstone for the martyred children, allowing us to vaguely imagine the tragic tragedy of that year. Without a doubt, it is fulfilling the responsibility that a literary worker should fulfill!

The author also sympathizes with the poor, helpless, and unyielding writers in the chaos with great emotion, as if he were speaking from personal experience, and wrote two successful works, "A Corner of Zhuanqing" and "Entering the City." I read it in one breath, and felt a heavy sense of oppression in my heart. He used skilled techniques to draw two opposing sides for the readers, one side is working hard, and the other is obscene and shameless, one side is heaven, and the other is hell; but those who live in heaven are evil demons, while those who are cruelly beaten into the eighteenth layer of hell are saints who are martyred.

The novella is special, somewhat like the story of Deng TieMei and Miao KeXiu organizing the volunteer army in Northeast China; but it is not entirely true, and the author has melted it and incorporated new materials. The whole chapter is divided into six chapters. In this article, there is a group of stateless migrants who would rather use their own blood to forge a new national soul of independence and freedom. Although they fell one after another under the oppression of the invaders, their immortal spirits are the symbol of China's victory and revival.

In short, in this collection of books, the author has used refined and mature artistic skills that are profound and easy to understand, and deep and detailed thinking, to write down the major historical events of the past eight years, which can be used for historical research by historians, and for contemporary and future generations to linger and watch, to look up and down and mourn. At the same time, he has also captured the grand scenes of the past eight years, the admirable and tearful living patterns, and the hateful and ugly mouths of the people, captured them in the lens, vividly shaped them, with blood and flesh, and screened them in front of the readers.
