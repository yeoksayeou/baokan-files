### Chairman's Statement: Current Economic Difficulties are a Temporary Dislocation; Hope All People Recognize the Need and Work Together for Construction

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Supreme National Defense Council passed the Emergency Economic Measures Plan on the morning of the 16th. Chairman Chiang issued a special statement on this, the full text of which is as follows:

Our country has undergone eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, and the national economy has suffered severe oppression and destruction by the enemy, which goes without saying. Therefore, after the victory, the government took recovery and construction as the most important tasks. However, to carry out recovery and construction, we must first achieve domestic peace and unity. Consequently, the first measure after the war was to hold political consultations to achieve peaceful unification. Our friendly nation, the United States, with a fair attitude, worked hard to mediate. More than a year has passed, and although the dawn of peace has occasionally appeared, the Communist Party stubbornly adheres to its views, does not implement the reorganization plan, and does not participate in the National Assembly. As a result, the government's policy of resolving political issues through political means could not be realized, and peace negotiations ultimately came to a standstill. The Communist Party's deliberate disruption of social order and implementation of actions to undermine national unity should bear the responsibility, which has also been clearly understood by our people. However, although the Communist Party refused to participate in the National Assembly and the National Government, the government, by virtue of its responsibilities, continued to strive for the implementation of democratic politics. The National Government will soon be reorganized. The urgent tasks ahead are to gather the nation's talents to decide on solutions and, in accordance with the Constitution and its implementation preparations, implement elections and complete party governance. In the National Government and various ministries and commissions, the committee members selected by various parties will be stipulated, and social figures will be invited to participate to strengthen the foundation of the government.

Communist Party's Disruption and Undermining of Peace Cause Current Economic Difficulties

The current problem in our country is not a problem of political parties, but in fact a problem of the development of democratic politics. This is the path that must be followed for nation-building and is related to the survival of our country. I sincerely hope that all compatriots across the country can dedicate their loyalty and sincerity, share the fate of the nation, unite as one, to save our country from its current difficulties and lay the foundation for nation-building.

At present, the economic situation in our country has reached a very serious juncture. Following the consumption of eight years of resistance against Japan and the destruction of Japanese aggression, the Communist Party has intensified its disturbances during the recovery period. Even during the period of mediation and negotiations, it constantly used force to expand its territory and never ceased its military actions. In various regions of North China and the three northeastern provinces, the areas where the Communist Party has entrenched itself have become even wider. Once occupied, they immediately establish their own regimes, issue banknotes, blockade the economy, and prevent the transportation of food and materials. In areas under the control of our government, the destruction of railways, transportation lines, and industrial and commercial enterprises is more thorough than during the Japanese occupation. Here are a few examples:

Our country has abundant coal reserves, which should meet domestic demand without shortage. However, due to the Communist Party's obstruction of transportation and destruction of mines, the production of various industries in our country last year could not fully supply domestic needs and had to be imported from abroad. Before the war, our country could fully supply itself with cotton and tobacco. However, last year, various provinces in the north suffered from repeated wars, resulting in reduced production. The raw materials needed by cotton and tobacco factories required imports amounting to as much as US$200 million. Our country is based on agriculture, but at present, the bulk of imported goods are agricultural products, which is deeply regrettable.

From the above, we must be able to deeply understand that the current economic difficulties are due to the destruction suffered in the eight years of resistance against Japan, as well as the Communist Party's disruption of the country and undermining of peace in the past year.

To Resolve the National Economic Crisis, Ten Emergency Measures are Decided

In the past year, the government has been very generous in handling foreign exchange. At the same time, wartime control policies have been abolished separately. This is because domestic industry and commerce lacked materials after the war and urgently needed to be replenished. Therefore, it was necessary to give industry and commerce the opportunity to develop freely. However, as the domestic economic situation became increasingly serious due to the Communist Party's disruption and the obstacles to national peace and unity, in order to adapt to the current environment and resolve the national economic crisis, the government had to comprehensively re-examine its economic policies and decided to take the following emergency measures: (1) The government's use of all foreign exchange and gold should be economized to prepare for the purchase of industrial raw materials and machinery, so that domestic production and transportation industries can continue to advance, and important daily necessities can also continue to be replenished. The exchange rate for settlement should be appropriately stipulated in accordance with the domestic and foreign currency purchasing power, so that it will no longer fluctuate. Therefore, starting from the 17th of this month, the exchange rate will be changed to 12,000 yuan of national currency per US dollar for settlement. Although this new exchange rate is higher than the previous one, it does not exceed the domestic price level. (2) Banning the buying and selling of gold on the market and prohibiting the circulation and trading of foreign currency notes to curb speculation. At the same time, the Central Bank will fully supply legitimate and legal foreign exchange. (3) The government should do its best to relieve the oppression of high interest rates on agricultural and industrial production and provide relief to agriculture and industry through loans or other means to support their development. (4) Government expenditures should be reduced to the greatest extent possible. All unnecessary new construction in this year's budget will be postponed. (5) Because our country has not yet widely implemented modern accounting systems, the collection of income tax and various direct taxes has not been significantly effective. Now, we should not seek precision in calculation, which would lead to prolonged delays, but should adopt rapid and effective collection methods. If this may increase the burden on individuals, in order to unanimously support the government to achieve economic stability, all our compatriots should recognize that this is indeed the way to increase national income and balance national revenue and expenditure, and should unanimously comply with it. (6) Various public utilities, if the government continues to subsidize them, the budget cannot be maintained. Therefore, reasonable increases should be made in the future. (7) The wages of laborers, based on pre-war prices, have actually increased several times, which is much better than the treatment of public educators and soldiers. The government will also use its foreign exchange to supply factories with raw materials for use, so that laborers can continue to work without fear of unemployment. The government has no intention of reducing the reasonable remuneration that laborers should receive, but also hopes that laborers will prioritize the general welfare of the public and express their patriotic spirit in unity with those who serve in other parts of society and the country, working hard and maintaining production. Future wage increases should be set at a maximum limit and should not be unrestricted, which would hinder the survival and development of industry. (8) Various state-owned enterprises that do not fall within the scope of heavy industry should be put up for auction or issue shares for public sale. (9) For a very small number of major daily necessities for people's livelihoods, such as rice, flour, cloth, coal, and edible oil, strict controls should be imposed. Those who violate control laws and engage in illegal activities such as speculation and hoarding will be severely punished. (10) Many commercial banks were newly established during the Anti-Japanese War, and some of them have engaged in speculative activities. The Ministry of Finance should strictly supervise and investigate them and punish them according to law.

Vigorously Carry Out Recovery and Construction; Cotton Production is Expected to be Self-Sufficient

In short, in the past year, although the Communist Party has done its best to destroy the economy, our government has still been working tirelessly to carry out various recovery and construction projects, and has made significant progress that is enough to comfort the people. Taking transportation as an example, at the beginning of last year, the railways under the control of our government were 7,845 kilometers. Although they were frequently attacked and destroyed by the Communist Party, the railways that can now be used for transportation have reached 11,887 kilometers, an increase of 50 percent. In terms of transport ships, before the Anti-Japanese War, in addition to foreign merchant ships, our country had a total of 570,000 tons of transport ships. At the end of the war, only 314,835 tons remained. Recently, it has reached 692,071 tons. In terms of production, last year, 960,000 bales of cotton yarn, several thousand tons of steel, 1,171,155 kilowatts of electricity, 300,000 tons of cement, and 13 million tons of coal were produced. This year, it is estimated that 2,379,000 bales of cotton yarn, 200,000 tons of steel, 1,638,500 kilowatts of electricity, 900,000 tons of cement, and 23 million tons of coal can be produced. The above-mentioned production figures are small compared to industrialized countries, but it is not easy to achieve these results given the various difficulties and obstacles last year. In terms of agriculture, this year, the cotton and tobacco imported from abroad account for 77.5 percent of the required quantity. It is expected that after this year's harvest season, our country may be able to supply 75 percent of cotton on its own. If we can intensify our efforts and expand production, it will not be difficult to achieve the hope of complete self-sufficiency.

Export trade has also been actively promoted. Goods such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, soybeans, eggs, tea, minerals, and oils have been exported to foreign countries. In addition, Taiwan Province is a region that produces sugar, tea, camphor, and rice. During the period when it was occupied by Japanese invaders, the annual trade surplus could reach US$250 million. Now that this rich area has also been recovered, trade will definitely increase in the future.

Our Country's Measures for Self-Reliance; Hope for Sympathy and Understanding from Friendly Nations

Finally, what I want to state to my compatriots is that although there are many current economic difficulties, there is no reason to be afraid. The reasons for the current economic difficulties in our country are all temporary dislocations, and the economic abnormalities are only limited to certain cities. In fact, the basic factors of agriculture and industry are originally sound. As long as all compatriots from all walks of life across the country can make resolute efforts in their work positions, help each other, cooperate closely, and closely coordinate, we will be able to overcome the current crisis. We should all remember that during the Anti-Japanese War, we also overcame the unprecedented and more serious crisis imposed on our country by Japanese aggression with the same determination and effort. If we can continue to uphold this spirit of perseverance, recognize the needs of the country, fulfill the obligations of the people, and move forward towards the path of nation-building with one heart and one mind, we will be able to achieve democratic politics and restore the normal state of our country's economy. This is where the government's responsibilities lie, and it is also what the country's bright future depends on. I especially hope that friendly nations will recognize that our country's measures to restore economic stability and self-reliance are aimed at achieving prosperity in world trade and contributing to world peace, and give them sympathy and understanding.

### National Assembly Representatives and Senators Remaining in Shanghai Suggest Seven Points in a Telegram to the Chairman; the Current Crisis Depends on the Chairman's Virtue

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Shanghai National Assembly Representatives Association and the National Senators Association held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon from 3:00 to 6:00 at the Shanghai Office of the Senators on Jianguo West Road. There was a heated discussion on the current issues of reorganizing the government, stabilizing finance, and promoting party and government affairs. When the attendees spoke in a somber tone about the gold and banknote rush, they unanimously believed that it was the result of financial and fiscal mismanagement. Yesterday's meeting was chaired by Senator Jiang Yong. The National Assembly representatives and senators remaining in Shanghai who attended the meeting included Hu Lin, Zhu Fengwei, Zhu Huiqing, Hu Jianzhong, Hu Qiuyuan, Chen Xiaowei, Wang Qizhang, Tan Guang, Wu Wentian, Xi Yu, Jin Zhenyu, Ruan Yicheng, Zheng Kuiyi, He Yuanming, Jiang Yiping, Wang Xiaolai, Ping Dingmou, Zhou Feicheng, Wu Luochu, Jiang Jianbai, Duanmu Kai, Wen Shouquan, Li Hongyuan, Pan Lianru, Chen Qitian, Su, Dai Tianchou, Ding Zhixiang, and more than 20 others. During the meeting, seven points of opinion were drafted and telegraphed to Chairman Chiang for adoption. The original text is as follows:

To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: More than 50 days have passed since the closing of the National Assembly, and the reorganization of the government has not yet been realized. The people's hopes have gradually faded away with the passage of time. Recently, the gold rush has surged, prices have soared, and the people's livelihoods have been plunged into despair. People are panicking, as if the end is near. However, the administrative authorities, although holding meetings constantly, have repeatedly declared that they will soon announce their plans. However, financial and fiscal mismanagement has been going on for a long time, and the use of gold has been a mistake again and again. Since Mr. Song Ziwen took charge of the Executive Yuan, he has concentrated the power of finance and taxation in his hands. Initially, he arbitrarily increased the salt tax, eroding the common people. Then, he forced a deduction of 40% of gold reserve certificates and used legal tender to redeem US dollar bonds, seeking petty gains and losing national credibility. The foundation of finance has been destroyed invisibly. After the victory, he did not urgently seek to support production and restore export trade to earn foreign exchange. He wanted to rely solely on the surplus materials of friendly nations to stabilize prices and rely on borrowing foreign debts to maintain the balance of payments. The state-owned enterprises he handled repeatedly led price increases in an attempt to increase revenue, but he did not know that stimulating prices would only lead to the adverse consequence of increasing national treasury expenditures. Various calculations have failed one after another. If personnel policies and systems are not changed at present, any stopgap measures, even if effective, can only temporarily stop the boiling. Inflation continues, and everyone is in danger. The remaining foreign exchange and gold will eventually run out. Furthermore, the military situation is urgent, and the political situation is murky. Looking to the future, how can we not be in danger? After unanimous discussion, the colleagues hereby propose: (1) Reorganize the government as soon as possible and attract talents, adhering to the principle of selecting only the virtuous and capable, without being limited by party affiliation, to give the people a fresh start; (2) Establish a democratic political system and increase the powers of popular and legislative bodies during the transition period, such as the Senate and the Legislative Yuan, so as to achieve the effect of supervision and review; (3) Investigate the responsibility of the highest responsible person for financial and fiscal mismanagement, rectify discipline, and regain the people's trust; (4) Re-establish economic, financial, and gold policies, prohibit the trading of US dollars in the market, and restore government credit as soon as possible to implement public debt policies to make up for issuance; (5) Thoroughly investigate the major manipulators of this gold rush. Please send senior officials from the Central Government to work with the Senate, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Procuratorate of the Court to investigate the exchange slips of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank and the traces of large amounts of cash coming and going, so as to clarify the truth and impose sanctions; (6) Establish a Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Association as soon as possible to promote various preparatory works for the implementation of the constitution; (7) In accordance with the various election laws and regulations drafted based on the Constitution, please publish the draft proposals in advance, so that all parties have the opportunity to participate or contribute opinions, so as to conform to the spirit of democracy. Your Excellency led the resistance against Japan and made contributions to the country. Today's crisis still depends on your virtue to support it. The whole people admire your hard work day and night. The colleagues witness the urgency of the crisis and dare not hide it. We hereby respectfully telegraph this to you, hoping for your wise judgment and decisiveness. The country is fortunate, the National Assembly representatives, the National Senators.

### Regarding Laws for Constitutional Implementation: National Defense Council to Discuss Later; Wang Chonghui Talks to Reporters About Drafting Process

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] The ten laws and regulations related to constitutional implementation, drafted by Wang Chonghui, were originally scheduled for discussion at the National Assembly's temporary meeting on the 16th. Due to time constraints, they will be discussed at the regular meeting on the 19th instead.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] The Legislative Committee of the Control Yuan is scheduled to reconvene on the morning of the 17th to discuss issues related to the Organic Law of the Control Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] This reporter recently visited Mr. Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, who described the process of drafting the various laws and regulations related to constitutional implementation as follows: After the closing of the National Assembly, Mr. Wang began this drafting work on January 3 of this year, assisted by a drafting committee composed of eleven people. The first law drafted was the Procedural Law for the Exercise of Powers by the National Assembly, followed by the Organic Laws of the Five Yuan of the National Government. According to Mr. Wang, any discrepancies between the current Organic Laws of the Five Yuan and the Constitution have been amended in the new Organic Laws. Next were the Election and Recall Law for National Assembly Representatives, and the Election and Recall Law for the President and Vice President. The number of National Assembly representatives is set at 2,500 or more. Mr. Wang also stated that, according to the National Assembly's resolution, the election law and organic law must be promulgated before the end of March. The number of members of the Legislative Yuan will be expanded soon, and then these new laws will be reviewed. The detailed content will be announced only after the five principles on which the laws are based have been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council. However, when drafting the laws, the focus was on ensuring that all parties and factions could freely compete in the elections, with no provisions favoring any particular party. The new laws have two characteristics: First, the election law stipulates that a secret ballot system must be adopted to absolutely guarantee freedom of will. Voters do not need to sign their names; otherwise, the ballot is invalid. Second, the election procedures are subject to open scrutiny, including voter registration, candidate registration, voting, and vote counting.

The draft treaty was submitted last week by Philippine negotiators, but the Chinese representatives considered it unacceptable because it revoked all clauses previously agreed upon by both parties.

### Overseas Chinese in Hanoi's Chinese-Vietnamese District to Undertake Third Evacuation

Our Consul-General in Hanoi will take various steps to carry out the third evacuation of overseas Chinese from the district. However, this is not the most important issue for the overseas Chinese; their greatest difficulty at present is the lack of food and the recovery of business.

### Liu Bocheng's Troops in Eastern Henan Cut into Two Sections

The remnants of their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Columns are personally led by Liu Bocheng and have been retreating from the area north of Liu River towards Cao County since the 13th. The National Army is following closely in pursuit. On the 14th, they arrived at a point ten li south of Cao County. The Communist troops were routed at the mere sight of them and did not dare to engage in battle.

Editorial

### The Government Has Released Its Measures

The economic situation is too chaotic, and all parties are eagerly hoping that the government will come up with a solution. Yesterday, the Supreme National Defense Council passed emergency economic measures, and the chairman provided a detailed explanation, the main points of which are as follows:

First, balancing the budget involves: A. Deferring non-urgent expenditures; B. Rectifying tax collection; C. Intensifying the auction of enemy and puppet property and surplus materials; D. Transferring state-owned production enterprises to private management through auction or the issuance of stocks.

Second, measures to stabilize the gold rush include: A. Prohibiting the buying and selling of gold; B. Prohibiting the circulation of foreign currencies; C. Adopting wartime regulations to control prices; D. Canceling export subsidies and import surcharges, and raising the official exchange rate for US dollars to 12,000 yuan.

The above plan encompasses finance, taxes, gold, US dollars, prices, exchange rates, and state-owned enterprises, and principled decisions have also been made regarding the limit of maximum wages and the maintenance of production loans. Since the end of the war, the above is undoubtedly the most important economic measure that has been proposed, and is arguably the most pleasing to the people. This is because (1) eliminating superfluous expenses, (2) transferring state-owned enterprises, (3) prohibiting the buying and selling of gold, and (4) prohibiting the circulation of foreign currencies have become unanimous demands of public opinion, and many people have also been advocating for the formal adjustment of foreign exchange and the implementation of price controls. Therefore, many of the measures decided yesterday, while important in nature, did not include any new or unexpected proposals. We want to specifically point out the following:

(1) The cancellation of export subsidies and import surcharges is extremely appropriate. Although these measures are ostensibly not an adjustment of foreign exchange, they are actually a means of raising the exchange rate, leaving several loopholes. First, the implementation of subsidies displeases friendly nations. Second, overseas remittances cannot be attracted, and we passively watch them overflow elsewhere. Third, a 50% surcharge on the import value is not the same as a 50% increase in import tariffs. In the minds of most foreign merchants, this is far less palatable than adjusting the exchange rate. Therefore, the decisive and timely correction is a legitimate measure rather than a careless decision.

(2) Adopting wartime regulations to control prices, thereby cracking down on hoarding and speculation, is naturally beyond reproach in theory. Furthermore, the existing so-called economic reconnaissance network is far more sophisticated in terms of legal principles and procedures. However, the results of wartime controls cannot actually be called successful. Whether in the public or private sphere, most of the painful experiences are still fresh in our minds. Therefore, at the beginning of victory, all control measures were abolished altogether, and there were indeed unavoidable reasons for this. Now, although prices are rising and the market is chaotic, we have no choice but to return to this old path. However, in terms of personnel, methods, categories, and policies, we hope to learn from the painful experiences and find a more perfect approach, not just be satisfied with wartime regulations. The chairman has stated that only a very small number of essential items for people's livelihood, such as rice, flour, cloth, fuel coal, and cooking oil, will be strictly controlled. It can be seen that this is not a comprehensive control, and it can also be seen that the government is still very cautious in adopting controls. We earnestly hope that the handling agencies will understand this intention well, handle the matter carefully, and avoid adding countless unnecessary troubles and pains to merchants and the public who are already in dire straits.

(3) Cutting unnecessary expenditures to balance the budget seems to be a routine platitude, but it is actually the most essential measure at present. As everyone knows, the various fluctuations in the economy are directly or indirectly related to inflation. The reason for inflation is simply that income does not meet expenditure, and we have no choice but to rely on issuing banknotes as a means of making up the difference. Therefore, if all extravagant expenditures can be drastically eliminated, then income and expenditure can gradually balance, new banknotes can be stopped from being issued, floating capital can gradually decrease, prices can stabilize, wages will not be increased again, interest rates will also return to normal, and unscrupulous merchants will no longer be able to display their skills on a grand scale. The problem is that fiscal affairs are too fragmented. Whether at the central or local level, all agencies rely on their subjective views, make eloquent arguments, and demand excessive amounts, so that all expenses become necessary in their eyes. For example, the city's budget has yet to be compiled and is still under discussion and review. This is because all expenses are deemed necessary by those in charge. Therefore, to defer or reduce non-urgent expenditures, the officials who coordinate the overall situation must make a firm decision to first suspend or abolish such non-urgent agencies and undertakings in order to achieve results.

Finally, we must say a few more words to the general merchants and public: The government's measures have already been released. To ensure that these measures are effective, on the one hand, the implementing agencies must first have confidence, conscientiously handle affairs, and properly implement the plan to ensure its thorough implementation. On the other hand, all relevant people must sincerely cooperate and not engage in tangible or intangible disruption and destruction. In particular, (1) if the public is unwilling to cooperate with price controls, it will not be completely satisfactory to rely solely on the police force to investigate and punish. (2) A few days ago, export subsidies were implemented, and the purpose was naturally to promote exports. However, unscrupulous hoarding merchants blindly raised prices, increasing the price of goods by more than double in just a few days, so that the effectiveness of government subsidies was completely offset. This time, the exchange rate has been adjusted to US$11,000 to one, and the export exchange rate is equivalent to doubling again (calculated at 3,350, it is equivalent to tripling). If we can make good use of this cost, the sales of export goods do not seem difficult to activate. It is hoped that everyone will broaden their horizons and follow the Chairman's instructions: Let us all work together to save our country from its current difficulties.

### Instability in Southern Wujin; Bandits Repeatedly Carry Out Assassinations

Changtai Jia Establishes Anti-Bandit Command Headquarters

[Our Wujin Dispatch] The sixth, seventh, and eighth districts south of the county seat are unstable, and assassinations have occurred repeatedly. In the past week alone, there have been two more incidents. One victim was Chu Bingsheng, the head of the seventh Bao of Mingfeng Town in the seventh district, who was kidnapped and killed by the local bandit leader Zhou Bida, who personally led more than ten accomplices, at Sanfentou in Heliu Wilderness on the evening of the twelfth. Another victim was Jiang Guozhen, the head of the tenth household of the eighth Jia of the second Bao of Lingtai Township, and his wife, Ms. Wang, who were assassinated in the same way on the evening of the eighth.

[Changshu Dispatch] In order to establish local security, Changshu, Taicang, and Jiading counties have organized an Anti-Bandit Command Headquarters, with Su Zhaogeng, the head of the Youth Corps, concurrently serving as the commander. The county magistrates, military section chiefs, and Chief Cai of the police bureau will each serve as deputy commanders. Once the deployment is complete, it will be established immediately.

### Anhui Provincial Government Requests the Ministry of Food to Adjust Grain Purchase Prices

[Our Hefei Dispatch] The Ministry of Food purchased a total of 600,000 Shi of grain in Anhui Province this year, setting the county grain price at 15,000 yuan per Shi. However, the grain prices in various counties have now risen significantly. Grain prices in the Chao-He area have risen to 60,000 yuan per Shi, and other counties are also close to this figure. Since the main income of the various counties is the land tax in the form of public grain, the lower the grain price, the more difficult it is to balance the budgets of the various counties. The Anhui Provincial Government has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Food requesting that it determine the purchase price according to the market price in two-month periods in order to increase the income of the various counties and reduce local difficulties.

### Pan-American Defense Committee Suggests Western Hemisphere Implement Joint Defense, Standardize Military Training and Equipment, Another Important Plan Following US-Canada Military Agreement

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The Pan-American Defense Committee has suggested to the American republics that weapons and equipment, as well as the training of the Western Hemisphere's land, sea, and air forces, be standardized. It also advocates establishing a military committee to promote closer cooperation in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Using forward bases for naval and air forces, the committee proposes adopting a "blitzkrieg" long-range defense principle and exchanging army, navy, and air force officers. The members of the Pan-American Defense Committee are the army, navy, and air force representatives from the twenty-one American nations.

[United Press, Washington, 15th] The Pan-American Defense Committee today announced a plan stipulating that the standardized land, sea, and air forces of the Americas should swiftly repel any attacker of the Western Hemisphere. Standardization of armaments and training is the key point of the plan. For example, Brazilian artillery batteries could use American shells, or the same essential parts could be fitted to patrol bombers from more than ten countries, and strategies would also converge. The plan calls for Latin American countries to re-equip their forces with American-style equipment, similar to the US-Canada joint defense agreement announced last week. The US and Canada have announced that they have agreed on a plan for wartime military cooperation and the exchange of post-war intelligence. The British government has also indicated that it intends to follow the path adopted by the United States for future defense equipment.

### US Actively Develops Arctic Region

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Moscow has accused the United States of attempting to turn the Arctic region into a "stronghold of imperialist conspiracies." Senior US military authorities have also not concealed their concern about the Arctic region. However, diplomatic and military officials here today repeatedly emphasized that the United States' concern for the Arctic region is by no means aggressive. Most officials agree with Air Force Commander Spaatz's view that "all industrialized countries are within the range of American aircraft, and conversely, the United States is also within the range of other countries, so in fact, the airspace above the United States is absolutely open." Therefore, military leaders are strongly advocating the establishment of weather stations and observation posts in the Arctic region. According to the recently announced US-Canada defense agreement, the two countries should exchange all information on common defense, including information on the Arctic region, as well as new equipment and supplies for the military.

### Collective Security Still Difficult to Achieve, US Secretary of War Strongly Advocates Maintaining Military Strength

[Agence France-Presse, Philadelphia, 15th] US Secretary of War Patterson, speaking at Temple University, stated that while people have optimistic calculations for 1947, believing they can rest easy, the collective security maintained by a world peace organization does not yet exist. This is an undeniable fact. Our country's security still depends on our resources. We are still in a world that relies solely on power. The fundamental problem for the United States is to achieve stability and lasting peace. I firmly believe that our best guarantee for preventing a new war disaster is to maintain military strength. Even if the United States wins in a new war, the economic organization of the United States may still collapse as a result, because the financial burden imposed on the country by war is extremely heavy. Regarding the issue of disarmament, one point must be noted: as long as Germany and Japan have the opportunity to restore their aggressive habits, we cannot consider the issue of disarmament for even a day. When we formulate any disarmament plan, we must pay attention to two points: (1) The disarmament plan must be followed by a clear agreement on a control system to ensure that the agreement is not violated. (2) Any disarmament plan aimed at avoiding war should not only prohibit "weapons of mass destruction," but should also limit the strength of the military, including the police, because the police can quickly be reorganized into the military. We should fully support the United Nations organization and disarmament, but in this nebulous period when the war has just ended and peace has not yet arrived, the world still weighs the importance of each country's pronouncements based on its military strength. Therefore, we must maintain our own security, which remains a fact, and we will insist on the policy of retaining considerable military strength.

### British Political Circles' Views on French-Czech Negotiations, Believing French Policy is Returning to its Old Ways

[Reuters, London, 15th] Political figures here are deeply interested in the news announced yesterday in Paris that France and Czechoslovakia are about to begin negotiations to revise the treaty between the two countries to suit the modern situation. France, Britain, and Czechoslovakia have different opinions on the German question. While France is negotiating a treaty with Britain, it is also announcing its intention to negotiate with Czechoslovakia, indicating that France may raise the German question in its negotiations with these two countries. At the same time, it also has considerable domestic implications. Some people in France were dissatisfied with the Anglo-French alliance, considering it a pro-British expression by France. Now that they see that France is also about to start with Eastern Europe, their doubts can be slightly reduced. France's future foreign policy seems to be returning to the style before and after liberation, using itself as a bridge between East and West. Britain's policy is to establish multilateral alliances within the scope of not harming the responsibilities between major Allied countries, and it is expected that it will welcome the French-Czech negotiations.

### Soviet Union Denies Building Atomic Fission Plant

[United Press, Moscow, 15th] The Soviet "Time Weekly" published today accused US Senator McMahon's recent remarks, saying that the Soviet Union is building an atomic fission plant behind the Ural Mountains, are purely nonsense.

### Australian Demobilization Ends

[Agence France-Presse, Sydney, 15th] Officials have announced that demobilization work within Australia has ended, with a total of 550,000 soldiers demobilized after the war. Currently, the Australian Air Force has 12,000 personnel, the Army 40,000, and the Navy 12,000.

### To Cope with Domestic Coal Famine Crisis, There is Talk that the British King May Return Home Early, Smuts Has Not Heard About This

[United Press, Cape Town, 15th] Marshal Smuts told United Press reporters today: I have not heard of rumors that King George will return home after arriving in South Africa to deal with the domestic crisis, and I do not think it is likely. Senior South African government officials believe that unless there is an extremely urgent situation, it will not prompt the King to return home. A certain newspaper run by the South African National Party took the lead today in describing this matter in huge proportions on the front page and in the political news column, saying that in this dark period, the King himself will undoubtedly be willing to fulfill his duties. The luxury enjoyed by the royal family in South Africa will be in sharp contrast to the hardships of the British people, and the communication reports on the royal family's travels will have the most unfavorable impact on the British people, or may lead to serious political developments, which is also unknown. If the King can quickly return to his country in times of emergency, and let the Queen and Princess, or just the Princess, continue the trip, it will not only have a major impact on the British people, but also on the South African people.

Fuel Panic Has a Major Impact

[Reuters, London, 16th] The reputation of the Labor government has apparently been greatly damaged by the fuel panic. General opinion is critical of the government for not warning the people before announcing the power outage measures. The power outage measures obviously have a serious impact on the government's original economic and industrial plans. The goal of exceeding 75% of pre-war exports seems to be unattainable, and Chancellor Dalton's budget will inevitably be changed as a result. The political repercussions are also significant, with the Conservative Party and Conservative newspapers taking this opportunity to launch a major attack on the government. However, the 400 Labor MPs have instead formed an even more determined front to support the government, and trade unions have also mostly supported the government and expressed sympathy for Shinwell, who is the target of public criticism. Therefore, it is expected that the Labor government will not collapse.

### Attlee Denies Coalition Government Rumors

[This Newspaper] London, 16th Broadcast: Rumors that Britain will form a coalition government, British Prime Minister Attlee today solemnly denied, claiming that this is absolutely nonsense.

### Holding German-Austrian Peace Conference, We Should Be an Invited Country, Actively Striving Based on the Potsdam Agreement

[Central News Agency, London, 16th] According to political circles here, regarding the issue of German-Austrian peace talks and the convening of a German-Austrian peace conference, our government has sent a note to the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, believing that (1) according to the Potsdam Agreement and the precedent set by the signing of peace treaties with Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland, the entire process related to German-Austrian peace negotiations should first be negotiated and decided by the five foreign ministers of the Foreign Ministers' Conference; (2) the convening and organization of the German-Austrian peace conference should be jointly agreed upon by the five countries; (3) the agenda of this Foreign Ministers' Conference of the United States, Britain, and Scotland should be limited to the drafting of the German-Austrian peace treaties. If there are any changes, the consent of China should be obtained. According to news from Nanjing, the United States and France have already given formal replies, agreeing with China's position. The British side has not yet replied, but the British Foreign Minister previously expressed to our Foreign Minister in Paris and New York that he agreed with China's position, and his reply is expected to be sent out soon. It is also heard that only the Soviet Union's reply opposed China's position on the issue of convening the peace conference, but our government is still continuing serious negotiations. The reason is that our country's position is entirely in line with the Potsdam Agreement. If the signatory countries have different views on the agreement, the views of the minority or one country cannot be taken as the standard.

### Greece Strictly on Guard, Orders Prohibition of Public Gatherings

[Reuters, Athens, 15th] After Greek Public Security Minister Tsakalotos reiterated the order prohibiting public gatherings, the police headquarters announced tonight that the mass rally scheduled to be held on Sunday by the left-wing groups and the Communist Party would be prohibited. The army was also ordered to stay in camp from tonight, not allowed to go out, in order to cope with any possible incidents.

### Headquarters of the Greek Investigation Team Will Move to Thessaloniki

[Reuters, Athens, 15th] The United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee decided today to move its headquarters from Athens to Thessaloniki, and the relocation can begin next Wednesday or Thursday. At the same time, the special team of the committee will begin inspecting worthy of investigation places around Athens starting Monday, and then submit a report to the headquarters in Thessaloniki. The committee also decided that representatives from Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania should not exceed one hour each time they present their views, and representatives from the Greek left-wing Liberation Front are allowed to present their views within two hours.

### Envoy Wu Jingxiong Presents Credentials to the Pope

[Agence France-Presse, Vatican City, 16th] The new Chinese ambassador to the Holy See, Wu Jingxiong, paid a visit to the Pope today to present his credentials, with a solemn ceremony. The ambassador delivered a speech in English, stating that the Chinese people have suffered deeply and realize the greatness of Christ's spirit of universal love. The Pope also replied in English, praising the ambassador's important mission and the achievements of the Chinese people in their revival. After the ceremony, the Pope also had a private conversation with Ambassador Wu.

### Bevin Elaborates on British Foreign Affairs

[Reuters, London, 15th] Foreign Minister Bevin spoke at a private meeting of five hundred Labor representatives.

British Troops to Withdraw from Greece Soon

He said that all British troops stationed in Greece would withdraw within ninety days from March 1st. Britain plans to establish joint commissions with several other countries, similar to the Anglo-French Committee, to discuss economic cooperation. The meeting lasted nearly three hours, and Bevin answered questions raised by the representatives. His speech first reviewed general diplomatic issues, saying that Britain's coal crisis also hinders its foreign policy. Other countries hope to obtain British coal loans and goods, but Britain cannot supply them for the time being, so foreign policy must be formulated based on this situation. He then mentioned the recent peace treaty discussions, and said that Britain intends to improve the alliance treaty signed with the Soviet Union and conclude an alliance with France.

Hoping for a Federal Germany

Regarding the future of Germany, it is hoped that there will be a federal political system, so that the states have strong powers, and not to concentrate power too much in the central institution. He said that the Soviet Union seems to want a centralized German authority, and the reason for this is not yet clear. It is hoped that it can be explored at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. Speaking of the general issue of peace and security, he does not believe that any country still wants war. Disarmament is necessary, but it must be implemented after the collective security system is established. He will try to establish international trust in the Moscow Conference, so that the collective security system can be established.

### Acheson Expresses Anti-Soviet Remarks, Soviet Union Lodges Protest with the United States, Acheson Once Stated the Aggressive Nature of Soviet Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 15th] A broadcast station here recently issued a message saying that when the US Senate held a meeting yesterday to discuss the appointment of Lilienthal as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Democratic Senator McKellar asked Undersecretary of State Acheson: Does he believe that if the Soviet Union possesses the atomic bomb, it will conquer Europe and the entire world? Acheson immediately replied: The current policy of the Soviet Union is indeed a policy of aggression and territorial expansion. The United Press and other newspapers have carried these remarks. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today sent a note to the US Embassy in the Soviet Union, protesting Acheson's anti-Soviet remarks, and asked US Ambassador Lieutenant General Smith to forward the note to the US government.

### Five US Soldiers in Tokyo Commit Murder after Drunkenness, Killing Five Japanese People, Injuring Twenty

[United Press, Tokyo, 16th] According to the US Far East Air Force today, five crazy soldiers from the Fifth Air Force killed five Japanese people and injured twenty in Hachijojima Town, west of Tokyo. The five soldiers will be tried by a military court for murder. It is also said that the five soldiers are now imprisoned in the Eighth Army barracks, and the reason for their madness was caused by drinking.

### New Japanese Reparations Plan, US Submits to the Far East Commission for Discussion, Wider Scale than the Pauley Plan

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 15th] Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, according to responsible parties here, the United States has drafted a plan to immediately distribute 30% of the total amount of Japanese reparations to the eleven countries concerned, and has submitted it to the Allied Far East Commission for discussion. France and the Soviet Union are also among these eleven countries, and they are currently studying the plan proposed by the United States. The Pauley Commission, President Truman's reparations commissioner, initially submitted a Japanese reparations plan to the State Department, making Japanese industry return to the level of 1928. All Japanese war industries, large-scale steel industries, hydroelectric plants, and other major industries must not exist, and all materials will be used for reparations. However, after careful study by the State Department, it was unanimously believed that the Pauley Plan would reduce the living standards of the Japanese people, so it was decided to revise it, making Japanese industry restore to the level of 1932. The Allied Far East Commission also issued a document proposing to allow Japanese industry to maintain its 1932-34 benchmark. In addition, it is still impossible to ascertain the attitude of the Soviet government on this matter. Some people are deeply afraid that the Soviet Union's opinion is that the United States may delay the distribution of Japanese reparations in order to avoid the economic collapse of Japan.

### Today's France

— Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Room

The author of this article, Koestler, is a famous journalist and novelist who has closely watched the undercurrents of the European situation since the First World War. Koestler was a Communist Party member, but dissatisfied with the Communist Party's policies, he wrote a book called "Darkness at Noon," describing the Moscow show trials.

Three Basic Facts

France today faces three basic facts:

First, France has lost her most basic national sovereignty, that is, the ability to protect her borders. The Maginot Line was originally just a paper tiger, but now even this paper tiger is gone. In history, there is no precedent for a country to fall from the status of a first-class country to the status of a third-class country without experiencing drastic changes in its social life and national character. Greece rose again after its decline, while Rome never recovered. Which direction French civilization will follow is still unknown at this moment, because the actual changes must pass through the people's consciousness, which cannot be seen at present.

What France urgently needs at present is a kind of spiritual retreat; she needs several years of peace and quiet in order to reconsider her various problems and reassess her new values. But this is impossible, partly because of the economic situation, but mostly because of the second basic fact, that the most numerous party in France today openly pledges allegiance to a foreign country whose doctrine and traditional ideology are completely different. For two thousand years, it has been a bastion of Latin traditional ideology, but now it has been transformed into an outpost of the Eastern Roman Empire's power. Regardless of whether Stalin's regime is good or bad, if France falls into the sphere of influence of a party supported by China or Mexico, her position is equally miserable.

The third basic fact is that the sovereignty within France has also been lost; that is to say, the heads of the French administration no longer hold the real power to control the country. To put it more specifically, the French government will not be able to sustain the general strike of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) controlled by the Communist Party for more than a few days before it has to collapse.

The Real Power of the French Trade Union

Readers must know that the general strike in France is not the same as the general strike of the American trade union and the partial strikes of elevator workers, dock workers, or miners. Under the current situation, the meaning of the general strike in France is like this: As soon as the order of the CGT is issued, the country's water, electricity, and gas are immediately cut off, firemen, subways, and buses immediately stop running, telephones and telegrams are immediately cut off, and the postal service immediately stops. Urban residents will have to starve, and all life will be suspended, falling into the sleeping beauty's posture.

Among the trump cards held by the French Communist Party, the control of the French CGT is only one, although it may be the most important one. The Communist Party's five million voters, its open declarations, and its presence in the National Assembly are only superficial fronts for an underground work of a revolutionary movement, which actually contains a tradition of conspiracy, a new philosophy of Machiavellianism, and the seizure of power.

Recently, there have often been cases of foreign refugees and even French people being sniped or kidnapped. They are mostly Communist Party members with disagreements, who used to hold fairly important Communist Party positions in large factories or rural areas, and are very familiar with the inside story of the Communist Party.

Liberalism Bows Its Head

The real cases are probably less than five or six, but rumors often arise in factories and rural areas, exaggerating the facts, making party members gradually feel that even a basic party member, once suspected of betraying the party, the result will not only be denounced as a "Fascist instigator," but will also be regarded as a dangerous element. The effect of this intimidation is exactly the goal pursued by the Communist Party leaders: to subject the party cadres to absolute "Bolshevik training" and to eliminate the easygoing individualism of the French working class. Libertarianism should be replaced by a strict totalitarian class consciousness, and the Latin national spirit should be replaced by the spirit of the Eastern Roman Empire.

It is generally believed that these party purges and related illegal acts are all the work of the newly established FTP members. The FTP is an underground organization, small in number, probably only four or five hundred people in the whole of France. They are like a kind of communist Ku Klux Klan, only lacking a romantic personality.

The Strength of the Third Column

In addition to this means of intimidation, there is also a policy of infiltration into enemy territory. The achievements of the German Fifth Column's secret activities in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France are not comparable to the capabilities of the French Third Column. The Third Column is the successor to the formally dissolved Third International. Its strength includes five million Communist Party voters, one hundred thousand trained party members, and it controls many important departments in the cabinet and many trade unions. If the Communist Party decides to launch a change, the government does not have much power to stop it. The trade unions are under their direct control, the police are secretly monitored by the Third Column, and the army is scattered in overseas colonies and within Germany. A certain Socialist Party representative once said: "If the Communist Party decides to take over the power of France, it only needs to make a few phone calls to succeed.

The Policies Taken by the Communist Party

However, the possibility of this is only a theory at present. A Communist Party coup would undoubtedly achieve initial and surprising success, but the dispersed opposition, for de Gaulle and the syndicalist factions, would soon unite and confront them, resulting in a civil war, followed by the intervention of foreign aid from both sides, forming a situation similar to Spain. This is what the Communist Party leaders are trying to avoid at present. Therefore, the Kremlin issued the following orders to the French Communist Party: Be moderate and steady, respond flexibly. Be prepared at all times. Seize all real power, wait for the opportunity, but do not act rashly, lest it cause difficult international disputes. (Translated from the New York Times Weekly)

### Intensifying the Investigation of the Gold Rush, Four Supervisory Committee Members are Sent to Shanghai, Supervisory Group to Start Work Today, Those Found to Have Manipulated the Market Will Be Tried According to Military Law

[This Newspaper] After the Economic Supervisory Group responsible for suppressing prices and eliminating speculation was officially established, yesterday was a regular weekly holiday. In addition to the active internal preparation work, there were no major external actions. The group will officially begin working in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on the fifth floor from today. All the staff are mixed compositions drawn from the Garrison Headquarters, Police Bureau, Municipal Government, 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, China Textile Company, etc. In order to avoid abuses, all staff members will be issued with case-handling certificates. Those who extort under false names can report to the group for detention. From today, the group will intensify its investigation into those suspected of manipulating finance, based on important clues obtained unofficially by the Garrison Headquarters and the Police Bureau. Those found to have solid evidence will be tried according to military law. The emergency measures for suppressing prices that have been drafted, after being approved by Zheng Jiemin, who was sent to Shanghai to investigate the gold rush, have been sent to Nanjing by a special person to be submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval. The period of existence of the group will depend on the needs, and the goal of the work is to restore prices to the standard before February 1st. Because the current financial and price surge is purely caused by speculative psychology, the Economic Supervisory Group is determined to use human power to suppress the man-made surge, and the work will continue for a considerable period of time.

[Another News] In order to thoroughly investigate the price surge in Shanghai, the Supervisory Yuan decided to send four supervisory committee members, Gu Fengxiang, He Hanwen, Zhang Qingzhen, and Wan Can, to Shanghai. Gu and others arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will start work immediately to jointly investigate whether there are any inappropriate measures and other irregularities.

### Cold Front Hits Shanghai, Today Will Be Colder

Yesterday's weather was unusually cold. According to the combined weather report from the Bund: a Siberian high-pressure system, coming from north of the Yangtze River, hit Shanghai, starting from 5 PM the day before yesterday. The temperature dropped sharply, falling to as low as 25.2 degrees Fahrenheit, already below freezing. Today's temperature may drop even more sharply, and tomorrow there might be a possibility of improvement. The combined weather report for yesterday is recorded below:

Weather Forecast: Yellow Sea, cloudy, hazy and freezing, moderate northerly wind, moderate waves. Central China, gloomy, cold and hazy, local snow or sleet, morning fog, moderate northerly wind.

The Shanghai American Naval Headquarters Intelligence Office announced last night that Admiral Cooke, commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, departed from Jiangwan Airport last night to return to the United States to attend a brief meeting. Accompanying him were Rear Admiral Murray and several staff members.

### Luo Qinghua Summoned to Beijing

Luo Qinghua, executive director of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, was summoned to Beijing last night to report on the actual situation of the city's soaring prices. According to Luo, he will represent the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce in suggesting to the government that it improve economic measures, encourage exports, and increase production in order to control materials and control prices. He will try to avoid regulatory methods that are close to oppressive interference. Luo is a member of the Economic Group of the Proposals Committee of the Third Plenary Session. It is said that he has collected various materials related to industry, commerce, finance, etc., in order to provide them for research and will stay in Beijing for several days.

### Dredging Rivers in Suburban Areas, Two Locations Scheduled to Start

Local labor-for-relief work is underway.

The Relief Administration allocates 40,000 bags of flour.

In low-lying areas of the city's roads, whenever there is heavy rain or the Huangpu River tides rise, flooding quickly turns into a swamp. Not only is it difficult for citizens to travel, but also warehouses are easily damaged by water. It is reported that the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has decided that the most important project this year is to dredge the rivers, which is urgent and cannot be delayed. Regarding the entire implementation plan, Zhenru and Jiangwan suburban areas are divided into implementation areas, and the labor-for-relief system will be adopted. The Zhenru area will focus on the Tiaoshu River, and the Jiangwan area will focus on the Shajing Port and Zoumatang, scheduled to start simultaneously on the 20th of this month. The dredging of rivers is beneficial to both farmland irrigation and the development of land fertility and shipping. The procedures for requisitioning labor are now underway. In addition to the Public Works Bureau being responsible for expenses such as tools and miscellaneous expenses, the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief Administration will allocate a total of 40,000 bags of flour. The first batch of 4,000 bags will be issued first and transported immediately. Each worker will work 1.5 cubic meters per day and be provided with 2.5 jin of flour. It is reported that the total budget of more than 11 billion national currency has been approved by the Municipal Government and sent to the Municipal Council for approval. After the re-election of the district chiefs is completed, a river dredging committee will be organized, with engineers sent by the Public Works Bureau and district chiefs serving as committee members to supervise the implementation. In addition, Longhua District, Pudong Yangjing District, Gaoqiao District, Yangshupu District, Shajing Port, etc., will also be decided to proceed.

### Application for Re-examination of Business Tax Deadline is the 20th of this Month

The Bureau of Finance has been handling the city's business tax for several months, and there are still payment notices for business tax for each quarter before the summer of the 35th year issued by the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau that have not been paid and for which the Finance Bureau has been requested to re-examine and correct. The bureau now sets a deadline of before February 20th. After this deadline, except for those who have already applied to the bureau, if any merchants submit payment notices issued by the Direct Tax Bureau to apply for re-examination and correction, they will not be accepted, and the tax and fines will be collected according to the original tax amount assessed by the Direct Tax Bureau.

### 30,000 Prostitutes, Most Suffer from Venereal Diseases, Municipal Health Bureau Tries to Prevent Spread

[This Newspaper Report] Before the prostitute problem can be completely resolved, it can only be remedied from the negative side, that is, to prevent the spread of venereal diseases. The Municipal Health Bureau Venereal Disease Prevention and Control Center was established in December of the 34th year.

According to the center's statistics, a total of 3,550 prostitutes went to the center for examination in the past year, belonging to 809 brothels. Examination results: 58.3% of them suffered from syphilis, and 15% suffered from gonorrhea. There are also those who suffer from other venereal diseases.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency in Washington, 15th] The US State Department is currently drafting the terms of agreement for engaging in negotiations with fifteen countries to implement the Fulbright Act. According to this Act, the United States will allocate funds from the proceeds of the sale of surplus materials abroad to provide scholarships for students studying abroad. According to State Department officials, the United States plans to conclude this type of agreement with China and use it as a blueprint for future agreements with the other fourteen countries (which are also countries from which the United States allocates funds for surplus materials). The Fulbright Act authorizes the Secretary of State to enter into agreements with any foreign government to use the funds obtained from the sale of surplus materials abroad to provide for the exchange of students between the United States and other countries. The State Department believes that this Act is an important matter for cultural work abroad. The Act stipulates that the amount used in each country should be limited to 20 million US dollars, and at the same time, the amount used in each country each year should not exceed 1 million US dollars.

After the start of the match, the two sides were evenly matched for 20 minutes. Then, Shang Shiqi of Jingwu penetrated deep into the center and knocked on the door to break the net, but it was invalidated for being offside. Youyou was stimulated by this and launched a large-scale counterattack at about 30 minutes. Lei Shuping crossed, and Bama took the opportunity to rush in and shoot with all his might. The ball entered from the left corner, and Youyou took the lead with one goal in the first half. After the change of sides, Jingwu launched a fierce attack and had opportunities to shoot from time to time. In particular, Chen Yifei's shot was swift and powerful and could have been successful, but it was saved by Zhang Rongcai, and the good opportunity was lost.

### Basketball League: Women's Team Displays Power; Green Team Crushes Youth League Yesterday; Morning Friends Defeats Jia Shen; All-Blacks Defeat Railways Jing

The final match saw the All-Blacks narrowly defeat Railways Jing with a score of 51 to 38. The details of each match are as follows:

Green Team Wins Over Youth League

The first match was between the Youth League and the Green Team. The referees were Wu Zibin and Wang Yiran. After the game began, Huang Mingyuan scored the first point under the basket, and the fans cheered and asked for more. Li Yunzhi added to the lead, making it 6-0 for the Green Team. Liu Zhenbao committed a foul while grabbing the ball. Liu Fengzhu of the Youth League took the free throw, breaking the ice. Liu Zhenbao returned the favor, and Yang Jian of the Youth League skillfully scored. However, Liu Zhenbao of the Green Team scored through both free throws and field goals. In the first quarter, the Green Team took the lead with a score of 12-3. In the second quarter, the Green Team's offense continued, while the Youth League still showed no improvement, scoring only three points with one free throw by Sun Fengzhu and one field goal by Liu Huishan. Liu Zhenshi of the Green Team dominated the game. At halftime, the Green Team led comfortably with a score of 25-6. After switching sides, Chen Huanzhi of the Green Team joined the game, replacing Li Yunzhi. Together with Ah Yuan and Zhenbao, they shared the scoring duties. In the third quarter, the score was 37-6. In the end, the Green Team overwhelmingly defeated the Youth League with a score of 54-12.

He Zheng of Morning Friends returned the favor, and Tao Yingshi of Jia Shen scored again. The two sides competed fiercely with a one-point difference.

Seeing the unfavorable situation, Morning Friends quickly replaced Ling Peng and Wang Bingfu with Huang Cunrui and Fu Qixia, boosting their momentum. The score soared, and Jia Shen was at a loss. When time ran out, Morning Friends overwhelmingly defeated Jia Shen with a score of 60-31.

### Basketball Notes: Green Team Remains Women's Basketball Leader with Five Consecutive Wins

In last night's opening women's basketball league match between the Green Team and the Youth League, it was a captivating game. The Youth League, as an emerging force, was expected to pose a threat to the Green Team. However, judging from the results of yesterday's game, the Green Team has not lost its status as the league leader, achieving five consecutive wins by overwhelmingly defeating the Youth League.

Sun Fengzhu of the Youth League has not retired and is regarded by others as the key to the Youth League's scoring. However, her performance yesterday was disappointing. She only made two out of seven free throws and scored only one field goal, totaling four points.

Li Huizhen of the Youth League is a defensive star, known for her agility and fondness for turnaround moves. However, she is relatively short and may have some nearsightedness; otherwise, she would be a headache for Huang Mingyuan.

Liu Zhenbao of the Green Team has been fortunate in recent games. Her layups and shots lack sophisticated form and the arched curve of Ah Yuan's one-handed layups. However, they are accurate. She scored 30 points last night, and in the match against the Women's Youth Red Team, she set a record by scoring 51 points.

In last night's second match between Morning Friends and Jia Shen, Jia Shen suffered from poor shooting, missing many shots. Zhu Zhonglin and Tao Yingshi need to improve their shooting skills. Huang Cunrui of Morning Friends, usually a long-range specialist, had a fruitless night. This might be a case of "shooting coldness."

In the final match, Railways Jing wore tank tops and shorts, fully geared up, while the All-Blacks wore fleece jackets and long pants, appearing nonchalant. Although they may seem like a disorganized group, they possess some strong skills. Jia Youliang, who returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, also played last night. Perhaps due to travel fatigue, he has not yet recovered, as his dashing power was not fully displayed. (German)

### Goods Shipped to Taiwan Province Must Be Approved by the Chief Executive's Office

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since Taiwan Province returned to the motherland after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, shipping between Shanghai and Taiwan has been frequent. However, the currency system has not yet been reformed, and the Taiwan dollar is still the currency in circulation, with 30 legal tender yuan exchanged for 1 Taiwan dollar. Yesterday, the relevant commercial institutions in this city and Taiwan Province suddenly received a telegram from the Taiwan Provincial Administrative Office, informing them that goods shipped from this city to Taiwan Province in the future must be approved by the office before they can be imported; otherwise, unloading will not be allowed, and outbound goods must be combined with currency.

### Import of Foreign Goods Requires Consulate Visa

Regarding the import of foreign goods into our country, the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee had previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informing our consulates abroad that the goods must be visaed by the consuls of the respective consulates. However, the certificates do not guarantee that the goods shipped by the merchants will be permitted upon import. The committee has now reported from various sources that some of our consulates abroad have not followed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' telegram order. The committee has specially sent another letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging them to immediately inform the consuls to pay attention.

### City Chamber of Commerce Urges All Industries Not to Blindly Raise Prices

The City Chamber of Commerce believes that the recent rise in gold prices has led to a rise in commodity prices, and the national economy and people's livelihoods are on the verge of collapse. It has issued a circular to all industry trade associations in the city, hoping to inform their member merchants not to blindly raise prices first. Even if there is a reason to raise prices, it must be based on legal profits, and there must not be excessive price increases to avoid public criticism and legal sanctions.

### Flour Mills Apply for Loans to Purchase Large Quantities of Wheat

Amid rising rice prices, flour prices have also soared. Five flour mills in this city, including Fuxin, Maoxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong, previously applied to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for a loan of 2 billion yuan in order to purchase domestic wheat from various regions and increase flour production, and Mayor Wu assisted in the process. It is now learned that the Four Banks Joint Treasury has approved the loan and will sign a contract in the coming days. In addition to the City Bank underwriting 10%, the rest will be handled by the four banks and two bureaus. The loan agreement will be formally signed in the coming days. Furthermore, the negotiated price of flour has not been adjusted since the municipal authorities last set it at 30,000 yuan per bag. However, the recent surge in black market flour prices will be thoroughly investigated in order to suppress prices and maintain the people's food supply.

### U.S. Flour Export Prices

[Reuters, New York, February 15th] The price of flour exported from the Gulf of Mexico is set at US$5.90 per hundred pounds, and the price of flour exported from the Atlantic coast is set at US$6.10 per hundred pounds. The price is US$1.4925 per U.S. dollar.

### Budget, Prices, Usury, and Fiscal Economy

— Jiang Junzhang

(1) Starting with the Budget

The second month of the thirty-sixth year has already begun. Since the start of the thirty-sixth year, we have not had a single day free from the troubles of price fluctuations. The settlement at the end of the lunar new year, and the five-day commercial holiday, have greatly stimulated prices. Moreover, the recent wave of gold and cash price increases across the country has given prices a frightening and extremely concerning stimulus. These facts show that the fiscal economy has reached a critical juncture. We have always believed that after victory, China urgently needed to achieve only two things. These two things are: (1) political peace and unification, and (2) fiscal balance. Only peace and unification can stabilize society and bring solace to the people who have tasted suffering. Only fiscal balance can stop inflation and stabilize ever increasing prices. It has been almost a year and a half since the victory, and these two issues have not been resolved. This is truly a most distressing matter.

Now, the budget for the thirty-sixth year has been initially completed, and has been reviewed by the Senate and the Legislative Yuan. According to the original figures, revenue is more than seven trillion, and expenditure is more than nine trillion. Chief Accountant Xu Kan said that this is the budget with the smallest percentage difference between expenditure and revenue since the Anti-Japanese War. This is indeed a fact, and it is also a gratifying thing. The Senate and the Legislative Yuan have made more suggestions for increasing revenue and decreasing expenditure. These two figures can certainly be made closer, and the fiscal balance we hope for may even be achieved. Even if it is not achieved, the minor difference on paper cannot be considered a big problem. However, what we feel in our experience is whether this budget can be adhered to without change? In the past, every year's budget was often used up in less than half a year, and the result was that there was no choice but to resort to supplementary allocations. The biggest reason for this is probably due to temporary expenditures and rising prices. The budget for the thirty-sixth year is based on the expenditure situation of the thirty-fifth year, but now only a little over a month has passed in the thirty-sixth year, and the price situation is no longer what it used to be. Therefore, we suspect that this budget, which is quite close to balance, will only be a balance on paper if no other efforts are made, and will not benefit the actual fiscal problems.

(2) The Impact of Usury and Speculators

The most important of the so-called other efforts is still the effective control of prices. We analyze that the main reasons for rising prices, in addition to the increase in currency, are the actions of social idle funds. The increase in currency has led to rising prices, and even greater profits from buying and selling goods. This profit has encouraged idle funds to move in this direction, and merchants are willing to raise interest rates to absorb them. This has created high-interest loans. Nowadays, almost no merchant is not related to high-interest loans. After the trend of high-interest loans is formed, the rise in prices gains a powerful factor that fuels the flames. Clearly, in order to maintain the value of the currency and stabilize fiscal revenue and expenditure, the government uses various methods to flatten prices, so that it cannot rise. This is in line with the needs of the general public (except speculators). The weakness of the purchasing power of the general public is also enough to prevent prices from rising. However, if prices do not rise, merchants burdened with high-interest loans will encounter irresistible misfortune and have to use various methods to promote price increases. We can remember that many times in the past, price increases were due to merchants spreading rumors that the currency system had changed or that the official exchange rate had increased. The fragile market and people's hearts really cannot withstand the spread of these rumors. Therefore, the materials related to these rumors will increase in price first. Once the price increase starts, it spreads like an epidemic, involving various prices in an instant, and thus becomes a general rise. The speculators are smiling, the lives of the general public are suffering, and the government's efforts to balance revenue and expenditure and contract issuance are completely unsuccessful. This is just one of the tricks of speculators.

In the past eight months, the government's fiscal policy has been quite effective. We don't need to say anything else, just take prices as an example. Before April, prices in the Shanghai-Nanjing area had a small fluctuation almost every twenty days, and a major fluctuation every month. However, in the three months from May to July, a considerable degree of calm was maintained. However, in this calm atmosphere, we heard another kind of cry, which was the so-called commercial collapse. Merchants' cries like this were also seen after November last year, arousing sympathy from public opinion. In the pens of news reporters, it is often described as the collapse of the entire social economy, thus arousing widespread attention. In fact, today speculators and money shops have inseparable relationship, so the bankruptcy of a speculative firm will inevitably involve banks, or even make salary earners who covet higher interest rates suffer losses. In cities like Nanjing, if twenty merchant firms of considerable scale go bankrupt, it may bring down one or two small banks, causing considerable waves in the financial world, and making a part of society feel uneasy. For this kind of consideration, the government has no choice but to make relief considerations. The foreign exchange adjustment in August last year contained this meaning to some extent. That is to say, the government's policy of stabilizing prices resulted in panic among speculative businesses. Because to resolve the crisis of speculative business, it is necessary to give the opportunity to adjust prices. However, the more prices are adjusted, the more government expenditures increase, and the further the difference between revenue and expenditure becomes, the more it has to resort to issuance to offset this difference. This destroys the entire fiscal policy by itself, and the economic future moves another step in a more dangerous direction.

(3) Those Who Disrupt Prices Are Public Enemies of the People

The government's past indulgence policy of adjusting certain prices for a certain period only encouraged the development of speculative business and further increased commercial panic. We only need to see that whenever there is a major adjustment or fluctuation in prices, interest rates will inevitably rise sharply. For example, before the end of last year, during the emergency state of the silver market when summarizing the lunar year, the interest rate in Nanjing was usually still below one jiao and five fen. However, during the period of large price fluctuations in the lunar new year, the interest rate suddenly rose to more than two jiao. This fact clearly shows that one price fluctuation solved the commercial crisis of the previous period, but also brewed the commercial crisis of the next period. Layers of cause and effect, without end. Moreover, because speculators have learned from the generous profits gained from past price adjustments, they conserve their energy, wait for an opportunity to move, create rumors and make trouble, and do everything they can to sell short and buy long, so that legitimate businesses are greatly disadvantaged and gradually shift to the path of opportunism. This trend is truly a fatal wound to the future of commerce.

Speaking fairly, speculators use the means of disrupting market prices to achieve the goal of illegal income. In wartime, the country hangs it as a taboo and punishes it with sanctions. Even now, disrupting finance is still not allowed by law. Moreover, this behavior is not only harmful to the country, but also harmful to the majority of compatriots. From the perspective of social morality, it is absolutely not allowed. According to general principles, those who want to obtain extraordinary profits are willing to take extraordinary risks, and even suffer the sacrifice of collapse, which is originally expected. Each person who seeks practical benefits is responsible for himself. Speculators infringe on the interests of the public, attempt to satisfy their own desires, and therefore encounter crises, or even lose their fortunes and ruin their reputations. This is self-inflicted blame and is the result they deserve. There is no need to sympathize with them, let alone provide relief to them. We must recognize that most of the businesses that encounter crises because of stable prices are speculators, the scum of the commercial world, the powerful factors that fluctuate prices, and should be sanctioned. Their appeals obtaining results is the failure of the country's fiscal policy, and the beginning of a more difficult life for the national economy, especially the salary earners.

In a word, high prices will cause disaster to both the country and the people's livelihood, and only those treacherous merchants who specialize in speculation and opportunism will be smiling. We must recognize this point clearly.

(4) Stabilize Prices and Fight Against Speculators

Based on the above, we can know that "balancing the budget and stabilizing prices" are still the golden rules in the current fiscal policy. It is only necessary to implement them thoroughly without the slightest hesitation. Only the stability of prices can prevent the budget from being destroyed. Only the stability of prices can make the treacherous merchants who specialize in speculation and opportunism eat their own bitter fruit. Only the thorough stability of prices can reduce interest rates, so that legitimate merchants are not exploited by high-interest loans, and legitimate business can be guaranteed to a considerable extent.

However, we should pay attention to another point. High-interest loans do absorb a considerable amount of idle funds in society. The failure of speculators and the result of lower interest rates will inevitably make general idle funds feel at a loss. The government should seize this opportunity and sell factories that can make money. This batch of idle funds can definitely be guided to industrial investment, and the government can also use this to take back legal currency to fill the expenses of the national treasury.

The huge expenditure of more than eight years of the Anti-Japanese War has plunged the country's finances into a dead end and put the people's livelihood on an unsustainable road. There are naturally unavoidable reasons for this, but undeniably, there are also many aspects that should be studied in the measures taken. Now it is almost a terminal illness. We hope that this price fluctuation is the last time. We know very well that if the government's budget for this year is handled in the past, expenditures will inevitably exceed revenue by a lot, and it will have to rely on issuance. However, this old method can no longer be used. It is necessary to increase definite income—such as selling enemy and puppet property or factories that are currently state-owned as soon as possible, or even borrowing from abroad—to ensure that issuance does not increase any more. On the one hand, we must also be determined to fight against speculative merchants and reduce them, so that prices can be stabilized and high-interest loans cannot occur. After the recent price fluctuation, there must be a period of stable and well-off period. The government should use this period to select a few places where prices are prone to fluctuations and have a great impact—such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou, etc., and then select ten or twenty kinds of daily necessities for people's livelihood and essential raw materials for industrial production, which were easily used by speculators to fluctuate prices in the past, and arrange them in advance. If there is a fluctuation, add control immediately. In this way, even if there is an increase, it can be calmed down, and speculative merchants will collapse one after another. If we are so careful and cautious for a year, then the political situation will gradually stabilize, the rural areas will gradually recover, export goods will gradually increase, and purchasing power will gradually increase. Then the fiscal economy can gradually enter a prosperous road.

In short, the coming year is an important juncture for China's finances. It is not an easy task to get through this juncture. It requires the double efforts and cooperation of the government and the people. The government must fulfill its due responsibilities, and the people must also fulfill their due obligations. In March last year, the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang was held in Chongqing. Mr. Weng Wenhao attended the meeting as the Minister of Economic Affairs and reported. His conclusion was to ask everyone to act with conscience and fulfill their responsibilities. This conclusion is still valid now, especially for speculators who want to fluctuate prices and seek high profits. With your conscience, do not make trouble again, otherwise you will definitely eat your own bitter fruit.

### The Qiantang Project Takes the First Step: Quarrying in the Fuchun River

— Hangzhou, 9th Quick News, Our Correspondent in Hangzhou, Huang Xingtian

Recently, the "Pan En" and "Tog" sea vessels, which crossed the perilous Zimen Sandbar in Hangzhou Bay, proudly sailed into Jiangmen with the posture of the first conquerors of the Qiantang River beach, which really caused a sensation in the city of Hangzhou and the residents along the river. Chairman Shen Li and Mayor Zhou specially congratulated the crew members for this, and also hosted a banquet for this group of "historical figures" on the Qiantang River. Now, these two sea transports are constantly towing five wooden barges each, loading them with stones, and shuttling between Tangshan and Sibao.

Tangshan is a bustling area created by another group of "historical figures" on the Qiantang River. It is located in the middle of the two small villages of Lingqiao and Lishan in Fuyang County. It is a cluster of rich mountains overlooking the quiet Spring River, that is, the "Ten Ridges of Tangshan" which block the passage of the Xiaoshan Yiqiao to Tonglu Jiangnan Highway, a cluster of uncultivable stone mountains.

Well-known Sand and Stone Production Area

As early as before the Anti-Japanese War, the name of Tangshan was well known, because when the famous Qianjiang Bridge was built, engineers came here to collect a large amount of sand and gravel for the needs of the bridge project. Now, these neglected stone mountains are contributing their strength for the welfare of the people on both sides of the Qiantang River. Since the Anti-Japanese War, due to the neglect of the seawall, the river water has become a very serious disaster. In order to protect the lives and property of the people of Jiangnan, the government did not hesitate to invest heavily, and successively established the Qiantang River Seawall Emergency Repair Committee and the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, on the one hand, to urgently repair the collapsed seawalls and block the sea water from encroaching on the land; on the other hand, to plan the Qiantang River renovation project and build a water diversion dam to return the river water to a certain river channel, making it a beneficial river flow for smooth navigation. The emergency repair project is divided into two parts: first, using Chai seawall to urgently block; and then restoring the valuable legacy left by Emperor Qianlong - the stone seawall. After a year of efforts, under the conditions of difficulty in both materials and funding, the construction of the Chai seawall has been largely completed, and future projects are entrusted to stones. In the past few months, many projects have not been able to start due to the difficulty in procuring stones, and finally stagnated. According to the estimates of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, the crushed stone and block stone required for the first phase of the project by the end of June this year has reached 100,000 cubic meters. If such a large amount of stone is contracted by merchants, not only will the cost be huge, but also the supply and demand will be difficult to meet. In order to save expenses and cooperate with the construction, the Seawall Engineering Bureau decided to use the latest mountain-opening machinery and materials provided by the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" to quarry stone in Tangshan by itself. Thus, this forgotten name was revived in memory and became even more distinct.

New Machines Quarry Stone, Extremely Precious

Using air compressors to quarry stone in China was only applied in the post-victory restoration and construction state. According to the captain of the quarrying project team, engineer Wu Zhengang, there are only two units in Tangshan south of the Yangtze River. North of the Yangtze River, there were also two units in Tailai that were used in the Yellow River project, but due to the impact of the civil war, the two units have been destroyed by the communists. Now, in China, the only two air compressors used in construction projects are in Tangshan. After eight years of destruction during the Anti-Japanese War, at a time when construction is urgently needed everywhere, hearing this unfortunate news is indeed very frustrating. But this makes us feel particularly precious about the two air compressors in Tangshan. The air compressor, in appearance, is a simple machine of fifteen cubic feet, and there are no complicated parts. It is composed of two parts: a gasoline engine and a compressor. Each unit can be equipped with three air drills (Jackhamner). The air pressure for drilling stone is 80 pounds per square minute to 100 pounds per square minute. The pressure will automatically adjust when the pressure is insufficient, so there is no need for manual management. The essential parts of the air drill are only three kinds: drill rod, drill tip, handle and its upper part. Each air drill can drill two feet of stone holes in a quarter of an hour, and can drill 50 feet to 60 feet of holes per day. If manual stone drilling is used, three stone workers can only drill two feet deep in one day, the difference is very large, and the greatness of the mechanical effect can be seen from this! The air drill and the air compressor are connected by an air duct. The two ends of the air duct are made of rubber, and the middle is a one-inch iron pipe, which is the commonly used tap water pipe. Now the mountains along the river in Tangshan are covered with these long pipes and ropes for climbing. The current drilling depth is six feet, and the distance between the holes varies from five feet to nine feet. The distance between the holes and the edge of the rock is about four feet to eight feet, which must be determined according to the firmness or looseness of the stone. Each six-foot-deep hole is filled with a maximum of four dynamite (about 1.4 pounds) to blast away the stones that need to be blasted (three is not enough). The dynamite they use is Gelatin (40Strength) produced by Du-pont, with fifty pounds per box, divided into 135 packages, which are long cylindrical bodies, wrapped in waterproof paper, and will explode even in water. The detonator is inserted into the dynamite for explosion. The circuit connection uses the series method. The length of the electric wire between the holes reaches 30 feet. The machine twisted down one, just like pumping air with an air pump. Fifty holes of dynamite exploded at the same time. If the circuit is shortened, several more holes can be blasted.

Loading Explosives to Blast Stone, Experimenting in the Snow

According to their experiments, a maximum of 58 holes can be blasted at one time, but each time there is one hole that explodes but does not detonate. On the day the reporter visited Tangshan, he happened to encounter spring snow. In order to allow the reporter to observe the explosion situation on the spot, engineer Wu Zhengang kindly directed the loading of explosives to blast stones in the snow, and did a small-scale experiment. A total of six holes were blasted that time. The sound of the explosion was heavy and not loud, but the blasting force was very fierce, and the blasted stones flew very far. The reporter stood more than 100 meters away and watched from a distance, and there were still many stones flying from the top of his head, scaring the reporter to quickly put away the camera and run to the shade of the tree. On the wooden barge near the shore, three one-inch-thick ocean pine planks were also broken by the gravel, and the fierceness of the force can be seen in general. The six-foot-deep stone holes that are currently drilled can blast out eight to ten cubic feet of stone blocks per explosion, that is, "firing a cannon" once, blasting 50 holes at a time, each time can produce 400 to 500 cubic feet of stone. This is a very big number! After blasting once, it takes almost three days for manual cleaning! The biggest difficulty now is that manpower and machinery cannot cooperate. Engineer Wu said well: "It is just like our Chinese society, where the new and the old coexist, and if the cooperation is not good, the progress will be slow. And our biggest difficulty is that manpower cannot keep up with the machine - this is very clearly manifested in cleaning and transportation.

### Half a Dynamite, Blasting Large Stones

The important work after the explosion is cleaning. One is to remove the mud and the other is to break the large stones. There is currently a formal water pump, which is a gasoline engine, with a motor and a battery, which is easier to start. The pumping volume is 350 gallons per minute (125 pounds per hour) The water pumping can wash away the mud on the Dnvamic head under the mountain as power. The stone materials needed for the seawall project at present are used to build water diversion and stone plate heads, and it is advisable to use block stone. However, it is very difficult to transport the blasted large stones, and it is not easy to break them manually, so Mcd-Gy Mstord is used to blast them. The method is to select a depression on the stone, and pay attention to the damaged surface, put half a dynamite, put the detonator into the dynamite, and pile about six inches of mud on it. The blasting force of the dynamite is downward, and the large stone can be blasted. If there is no position to put the dynamite, drill a five-inch or six-inch deep hole, and then apply the medicine to bomb, you can get the ideal block stone. As for the gravel needed for ordinary seawall construction, there are two cranes or stone crushers and a pre-shaped stone crusher jawgosher, all of which are gasoline engines. The latter can crush seven cubic yards of stone per hour, while manual labor requires about 30 people to cope. The former has not yet been used, but the stone blocks can be directly thrown onto the ship after crushing, which can reduce a lot of manpower. Before the machine is assembled, moving stones is the most difficult work. Ordinary commercial wooden sailing ships can load 15 cubic feet of stone at a time, and it takes six people a day to transport it. It can be seen that the speed of blasting stone and moving stone is very different, just like the plane and walking on the other side of the shore.

### Auspicious Omen, Green Calyx and Prosperous Flowers

— Wuyuan, one day's news, our special correspondent Ning Po

Changtan Village (North Township), 40 miles away from the county seat, is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with clear and beautiful scenery. There are three kinds of precious plants in its territory. One is the Phoebe nanmu of Longxi Pavilion, the second is the sweet-scented osmanthus in front of the Tu Temple, and the third is the green plum beside the seed well. Rare things are precious, which is indeed rare in other places. The reporter passed through the area yesterday, and the light makeup of plum buds and flowers was reflected into the eyes from afar. Looking at it up close, the tree shape expanded, the body was strong and straight, the young branches were green and lush, the old trunks were scattered, and the flower buds and flowers were extremely prosperous. The green petals and green heart were clear and lovely in color. Asking the villagers, they said: This plum belongs to one of the green calyx, the age is still young, and there are absolutely no similar ones in the surrounding area. There are five petals, which bloom first and wither later. The fruit is always green and crisp and not yellow, containing auspicious qualities. Last year, the flowers were in full bloom and the autumn harvest was stable. This year, the flowers are even more abundant, and there is a great harvest. This can be verified. According to the plum blossoms, although there are many kinds, the only colors that are commonly seen are red, white, bright yellow, and green are rarely seen. It can be seen that the rare and wonderful flowers in the grass and trees are not easy to collect in their entirety, and it is recorded for the study of botanists.

### A Tragic Incident in Hong Kong's Transportation Sector: The Xian Steamer Burns, Hundreds of Passengers Perish Simultaneously, Either by Fire or Drowning

— Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper's Maritime Correspondent, Zǐ Jiàn, Dated the 4th

"The Xian Steamer is destroyed!" As this news spread, residents of Hong Kong flocked to the waterfront to "mourn" this unfortunate vessel. It was an "old friend" to the people of Hong Kong, having plied the waters between Hong Kong and Guangzhou for over two decades. Almost every resident of Hong Kong, with very few exceptions, had been a passenger on it. To draw a rough comparison, the relationship between the Xian Steamer and the people of Hong Kong was akin to that of a large steamer operating between Shanghai and Ningbo with the people of Shanghai.

Beyond the loss of the ship and cargo, valued at over five million Hong Kong dollars, the Xian Steamer fire directly and indirectly claimed the lives of at least two or three hundred people. This loss is truly heartbreaking!

Fire Erupts from Smoke, Instantly Engulfing the Deck

The Xian Steamer caught fire just one hour before its scheduled departure for Guangzhou. Most of the passengers had already disembarked, some having taken a nap on board. The Xian Steamer was scheduled to depart at 6:00 AM that day. The fire broke out around 5:00 AM, when it was still dark. For some unknown reason, a thick plume of smoke suddenly billowed from the large cabin at the stern. Fire erupted from the smoke, and in an instant, it engulfed the entire deck and spread upwards. The passengers in the upper-level dining area were alerted in time to escape. However, those in the cabins below were trapped with no way out, as the doors were blocked by the flames. Some jumped into the water to escape. Fortunately, the waning moon was setting, and the current was not too strong. However, the distance from the cabin doors at the stern to the shore was over a hundred feet. Few were able to swim to the other side or be rescued. Thus, those who did not burn to death drowned, creating a scene of utter human tragedy!

According to the ship's supervisor, Yóu Kūn, who spoke to our reporter, the fire started near the "Yan Tai" area in the main cabin. When the fire broke out, the crew and passengers on the scene did their best to extinguish it, using over twenty cotton blankets. However, the fire was too intense, and flames burst from all sides of the blankets. In less than ten minutes, the entire ship was ablaze.

Cause of Fire Still Under Thorough Investigation

The cause of the fire has not yet been definitively determined. Initial reports suggested that the ship was carrying gasoline, and a passenger carelessly left a spark, leading to the disaster. However, company officials have denied this, stating that the ship never carried any dangerous goods. Another report suggests that the main cabin contained a large quantity of goods such as rubber, rattan, and cardboard. It is suspected that the fire was caused by these flammable materials.

After the stern caught fire, the flames quickly spread to the left side of the ship, which was close to the pier, thus threatening the pier as well. About fifteen minutes after the fire started, the fire department received a report, and all the fire trucks were dispatched. Upon arrival, they first focused on extinguishing the flames on the pier, putting out the fire there. However, the fire on the ship did not diminish despite the concentrated efforts of the firefighters. The flames gradually spread to the right side of the ship and then from the main cabin to the third floor of the stern building. Every part of the ship was affected, with the most intense fire in the stern. The bow cabins were only partially affected, and some parts may be salvageable. After the fire broke out, Chinese and Western detectives also arrived to maintain order, sealing off traffic near the pier and prohibiting pedestrians from passing through to facilitate rescue efforts and prevent potential explosions.

The ship carried a total of 350 tons of cargo, including over 1,200 pieces of opium, 150 bales of raw cotton (over twenty of which were salvaged), approximately 2,000 pieces of hardware, wire ropes, iron nails, scrap copper, scrap iron, and zinc sheets, over 1,000 pieces of Western medicine and pigments, totaling 4,810 pieces. The loss is enormous, at least over a million dollars.

At Least Two to Three Hundred Passengers Perished

As for the exact number of passengers who perished, it is difficult to determine the exact figure at this time, but it is believed to be at least two to three hundred. It is reported that over thirty charred bodies have been found in the main cabin. When firefighters sprayed water, they disintegrated, and intestines and other organs were seen flowing out, a truly tragic sight.

According to company sources, nearly a thousand passengers had purchased tickets in advance from the company. Mr. Chē Zàiqīng, the Deputy Manager of the Dàgōng Bookstore in Hong Kong, and his wife, both from Shanghai, were traveling to Guangzhou this morning with their children. When the fire broke out, Mr. Chē carried his son, and his wife carried their daughter, jumping into the sea to escape. Afterward, their daughter went missing.

Rescuing People from the Sea, Ancient Paintings Destroyed by Flames

Zhāng Ān, a partner at the Yuè Nán Hotel on Connaught Road, acted heroically, jumping into the sea and rescuing seven passengers.

Among the passengers in the dining room were a group of Guangdong antique collectors. They had brought precious ancient artifacts to Hong Kong a week earlier to participate in an exhibition. While their lives were fortunately spared, most of their antiques were lost in the fire. It is said that the lost masterpieces included the "Xiānguǎn Jiù Jīn Tú" by Huáng Dàchī, an album of paintings by Wú Lì, a fan album by Dīng Zhènpéng, an album by Huáng Shígǔ, a fan painting by Emperor Huīzōng of Song, miscellaneous albums from the Song and Yuan dynasties, "Dámó Facing the Wall" by Guànxiū of the Five Dynasties, and "Mother and Child Apes" by a Song artist, all national treasures.

Docking for Repairs, Resuming Service in Two to Three Months

Our reporter had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Willie, the owner of the Xian Steamer. According to him, the ship's hull was burned, but the engine was fortunately preserved. After docking for repairs, it should be able to resume service in two to three months.

The Xian Steamer has a cargo capacity of 660 tons. It was built in 1924 at the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong and is owned by the Tung An Steamship Company. It is insured for 800,000 dollars. After burning for six hours, it is still afloat, and the surface does not appear to be severely damaged. Part of the ship's chimney has not been damaged. The gangway at the bow also suffered only minor damage. When the Pacific War broke out, the ship sailed to Macau (its sister ship, the Shu An, sank in the waters of Hong Kong). In 1944, it was seized by the Japanese and returned to Hong Kong. After the war, it was recovered and resumed service on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route for a year.

### Tang Dike Project: Taking the First Step, Quarrying Stone on the Banks of the Fuchun River (Part Two)

— Quick Dispatch from Hangzhou, Dated the 9th. Our Newspaper's Correspondent in Hangzhou, Huáng Xíngtiān

(Continued from Page Seven)

At the Tangshan Quarry, there are also two very important machines – bulldozers, a D7 and a D4, powered by a combination of gasoline and diesel engines. They are used for leveling earth and towing heavy objects. The movement of all the machinery at Tangshan depends on their power. Recently, Engineer Wu and Lu Lianghui, the head of the Mechanical Group, have been trying to drag the D7 bulldozer up the mountain. Because the water pressure from the on-site pump is very low, it is not enough to wash away the topsoil on the mountain. Therefore, they want to use the bulldozer to remove the topsoil, reducing the burden of the flushing work, saving labor, and speeding up the work. According to Mr. Wu Zhengang, "The sea dike requires a lot of stone. If the fundamental project begins and the six-year plan is realized, with the construction of breakwaters and stone headlands on Hangzhou Bay, even more extensive development will be needed. Therefore, we must actively reduce manual labor and achieve complete mechanization of stone quarrying, moving, and transporting!" I believe his words will soon come true. Currently, they are building two docks and already have two seagoing vessels, the "Pan En" (650 tons) and the "Tug" (450 tons), and twenty wooden barges, each capable of carrying 50 cubic meters of stone. Each vessel will tow five wooden barges, carrying 500 cubic meters per day. However, the stone loading cannot keep up, so they are currently only able to transport 200 to 300 cubic meters per day. Assuming twenty sunny days per month, they can produce 60,000 cubic meters per year. Although this figure is 40,000 cubic meters short of the original plan, as long as the transportation work can be closely coordinated with the blasting work mechanically, not only can it be made up, but it can also exceed the target. Since the start of work more than two months ago, 1,000 cubic meters of stone have been produced. Workers are paid in flour, with one bag for every three days of work, averaging fourteen pounds per day. If contracted out, each cubic meter would cost 7,000 yuan. Currently, according to cost accounting, each cubic meter only costs 5,000 yuan. In other words, the annual target can save 10.2 million yuan. Moreover, contract work will increase due to the price index, while self-extraction can reduce costs as production increases!

Currently, there are an average of forty engineers, managers, mechanics, and workers working at Tangshan every day. Among them, in addition to the engineering team, there are sixteen long-term workers who are working and receiving mechanical training at the same time. They live in two mobile homes, with running water and electricity. A D.C. Generator 1.5KW DC generator allows 60-watt light bulbs to shine brightly. This is something to be proud of in Tangshan because, along the Qiantang River upstream from Hangzhou, only Tangshan has electric lights! The indoor equipment is simple, and they sleep on military canvas beds, but the reporter spent a night there and lived very comfortably, feeling as warm as early summer. That night, it snowed heavily, but none of us felt it. All the staff are young, not only enthusiastic and lively but also get along like family. At first, they lived a damp tent life, but soon they created this "exclusive village" centered on mobile homes, surrounded by mountains on three sides and facing the river. The once-dead valley has now become a vibrant place. Nearby villagers are watching their new neighbors' prosperity with curious eyes. Only one thing makes them uneasy: the mountain's Temple of the God of Wealth has been used as a gunpowder depot by the engineering team. During the Lunar New Year, many people want to burn incense and worship Buddha but have no way to do so. A "gentry" from Lishan Township complained to the reporter: "The Bodhisattva is a big deal for us. They put the gunpowder in the temple, this, this..." In fact, the villagers are going to worship the Bodhisattva for their own destiny, while the engineering team is using their hands to create a good destiny for the farmers working along the river! The Qiantang River has been plagued by disasters for generations. They want to use human power to subdue the reckless nature of the Qiantang River, just like our ancestors tamed cattle and horses by hand, making them serve humanity. They not only want to prevent the water from harming the residents along the river again but also want to make it serve humanity, creating vast fertile fields and facilitating boat transportation. The stone quarrying engineering team is shouldering the most basic mission of this great plan. They want to put the destiny of the farmers, which is entrusted to the illusory Bodhisattva, in the real world, in their own hands. They are pioneers. Although they surrounded the Bodhisattva with gunpowder, they are right, they should be respected and loved. The reporter left the "exclusive village" of Tangshan, and will always cherish and look forward to this vibrant group! (Written on the banks of the Fuchun River in Yushan on the evening of the 8th)

### Hold Back on Praising This Living Hell

Why do many people outside the Communist areas think the Communist Party is good?

But why do people inside the Communist areas try every trick possible and risk countless hardships to escape? They endure leaving their hometowns, abandoning their elderly parents, and abandoning their beloved wives and children. Don't they know that escaping means they will have no food or clothing? Don't they know the taste of sleeping on the streets, freezing in the cold without clothes and suffering from hunger? But they escape at all costs! Heavens! Why do they escape at all costs?

It is not surprising that many people outside the Communist areas think the Communist Party is good because they are far from that society and have not seen through the "mystery of that society."

When you do not know a person or have not been to a place, and you first hear the person's great name or the prosperity of a certain place, then everything you idealize in your mind is not the truth about that person or place unless you truly interact with that person or visit that place. Your understanding will then be real.

Regarding the mystery of the Communist Party, to clarify the truth for everyone, it is best to give them the opportunity to taste that insidious, vicious, and bloody taste. But if you can't escape, don't blame me! (Ā Bīng)

### Private Schools Still Exist in Changshu District

A few days ago, I was passing by Damuqiao Road when I suddenly heard the sound of chanting and reading. I am naturally curious, so I followed the sound and found forty or fifty young children sitting in a dark thatched house, being taught by a teacher using methods from a century ago. The textbooks were not nationally prescribed, the lighting in the room was not suitable for children's eyesight, and a dialect was used, making the words unclear. I think there are public and private schools all over Changshu District, enough to meet the needs of school-age children. Why are there still private schools being established? I hope the Education Bureau will send someone to inspect the situation and ban them to emphasize education and revive morals. (Féng Yì)

### Dora - One of "Russian Profiles"

— By Gorky, Translated by Shi Heng

In the sanatorium, there were eight people suffering from lung disease. Among all patients, those with lung disease are usually the most willful: because as long as their humidity rises a little, they will be fearful, angry, or dejected for no reason.

The tuberculosis bacillus has a conflicting power: it kills a person's life on one hand, and arouses his desire for life on the other. This can be seen from the following fact: tuberculosis usually has a high degree of erotic characteristics, and even the most hopeless patients have a stubborn and noble belief in recovering their health. I seem to remember that the pathologist Strumpell called this condition "tuberculosis hope."

Eight tuberculosis patients lived together in a sanatorium in Crimea, all cared for by a maid named Dora, whose background was unknown. Sometimes she said she was Estonian, sometimes she said she was Karelian. However, she spoke like a Tauridean. She sometimes spoke with a Tatar accent and sometimes with an Armenian accent. She was tall and strong, but her steps were light, and her movements were quick and agile. Her face had a good quality like that of a horse trainer; her red lips contained a kind and fatty smile, and her big eyes emitted a strange light purple color, containing the oiliness of that smile. When she was contemplative, her less radiant eyes were clouded, and her gaze became dull. She didn't have much knowledge and appeared foolish, especially when she tried to be cunning, she appeared particularly stupid. Therefore, the patients called her "Dura" (meaning melon in Russian), not very cleverly teasing her name. But the girl didn't get angry because of this, and continued to smile. She treated the patients with as much tolerance as a mother treats her children. Whenever a lung-sick man reached out his cold, lead-colored hand to grab her, she would calmly push away the poor, moist hand of the unfortunate person with her big, red palm, and say, "Don't grab! It's not good for you."

All kinds of people stubbornly pursued her: shop assistants, porters, and once a seemingly powerful fisherman—a widower. They liked her rough beauty, her physical strength, her tireless energy, and her optimistic nature. Everyone competed to take this peaceful and docile animal as his life partner; but her attitude towards men was like that of a free and wealthy man, she knew very well when and where to use her capital. She refused those marriage proposals with that monotonous, expressionless, and inoffensive smile, she listened quietly to the endless thoughts of the patients, and pushed away their reckless caresses.

Whether the north wind was blowing, or thick fog was bringing a layer of frost to the houses on the top of the hill, whether the patients were shriveling up in thick quilts, or complaining about the cold even when wearing warm clothes, she was uncomfortably hot. At night, after arranging for everyone to sleep, Dora would put on a black scarf embroidered with red roses in the corner, walk to the balcony, kneel under my window, look at the sky, and sigh as she prayed:

"Ah, Holy Mother... Christ, Lord! You, Saint Nicholas, the humble servant of God!..."

I couldn't see any poetry in Dora, she didn't like flowers, thinking that flowers would only mess up the room. One night, a pastor's wife, was suffering from intestinal tuberculosis, and was ecstatic because of the brilliance of the sky and the stars, Dora rudely drove away her enthusiasm. "The sky," she said, "is like a vegetable meatball..."

One day, the ninth patient arrived. He panted laboriously, climbed the stairs to the attic, grabbed the top railing and said to Dora, "You see how handsome I am, don't you?"

There was a mixture of sorrow and joy in these words. He smiled, glancing at the great big girl, her round and full breasts.

"Ha! What a healthy animal you are!" he said, hurriedly swallowing a mouthful of cold air. "Oh, you can help me recover, can't you?"

"Oh, of course," Dora replied in her Armenian accent.

The man had the face of a night owl, round cat eyes, a nose with a curled tip, a few black whiskers, in short, a sneering and cruel face.

From that day on, Dora seemed to have been enchanted and changed, giving us great discomfort. She began to ignore our wishes, hurriedly walked through our rooms, cleaned weakly, and only answered our complaints and accusations angrily, but at the same time, a glimmer of intoxication flashed in her horse-training eyes. She seemed to suddenly become deaf and mute, often turning her head attentively towards the attic, where the night owl-like student Filipov lay coughing and unable to catch his breath. Whenever she was free during the day, Dora would run to him and stay in his room until sunset, with no way to lure her out.

Speaking of that man—he was dying. The scene of death was different from usual, he laughed and mocked, whistling a comic tune from beginning to end, but the tune was often interrupted by bursts of coughing. He was a bit deliberately pretentious; he looked like a fearless demon, but that mask was finally cleverly exposed.

"What do you think of these strange things, my dear friend?" he often said to me, narrowing his cat eyes. "Do you like these? Day, night, birth, love, knowledge, death, isn't it? Isn't it funny? As the French say, N'est-ce pas? Especially funny for a twenty-six-year-old—I'm talking about myself... Dora!"

At this time, I heard the sound of spoons and the rustling of furniture, Dora appeared, her eyes wide open, silently waiting for the man's instructions.

"My good old woman, bring me some grapes, quickly!" he would order her, then turn to me and say, "A very ignorant and stupid woman."

He hated all the patients, and would mercilessly ridicule them as soon as they showed a little bit of strangeness, and people didn't like him either. As for me, he became friends with me because he liked literature, which made us very close.

"Literature is the best of all human inventions," he would say, touching his lips with his lead-colored hand. "The closer to life, the better..."

In my opinion, he was dying not so much because of lung disease, but because his soul had suffered a serious blow.

He died on the sixty-ninth day after entering the sanatorium, and in the throes of death he muttered blankly, "Fima... my whole life... I love you... only you... forever, Fima... darling..."

At that time, I was sitting at the foot of his bed, and Dora was standing beside Filipov, sniffing and patting her dry hair with her big palm.

She took a package and clipped it under her armpit.

"What is he saying?" she asked anxiously, straightening her body. "Who is this 'Fima' he's talking about?"

"Obviously a girl, a woman, he loved before, and still loves now."

"He? This—Fima?" Dora asked in surprise. "No—no, he loves me. He loved me as soon as he came here..."

But she listened quietly to the student's delirium, raised her gray eyebrows, wiped her moist face with her apron, threw the package onto my lap, and said, "This is his burial clothes; socks, shirt, slippers." Then she quietly left the room.

Twenty minutes later, the student Filipov stopped delirious. He looked eagerly at the black square window on the white wall and sighed. Obviously he wanted to say something, but couldn't. Then, his small body, exhausted to the bone, straightened out in eternal peace.

I went to find Dora. She was standing on the balcony, looking down at the place where the sky and the sea met, so dark, but different on both sides. She turned her fat face to look at me, and I was surprised to find that her face was unusually stern.

"He's dead. Go bury him, Dora."

"I don't want to."

Dora began to rub the floor with her feet, as if to wipe away saliva.

"I don't want to," she repeated. "I don't want to do anything for such a person! Think about it, what is he! He said he loved me, but he has always been..."

"Yes, but you see he is already dead, isn't he?"

"Oh, what does it matter? Of course I know he's dead. I'm not blind, am I? I even used my last penny to buy him burial clothes. As soon as he arrived here, I knew he was going to die, but I said to myself: poor child!... He will definitely die! But everyone has to die. But why did he have to lie? 'I have never loved a girl,' he said. Well, now you're lying here, and there's a girl for you... Death can go to hell, but you can't lie..."

She was speaking in a low voice, as if thinking about something else. Then, suddenly, she began to sob—so sorrowfully, as if she had swallowed a full cup of boiling water and burned herself.

"Come on, Dora!..."

"If you are so kind to such a person, dress him yourself! As for me—no, no, I don't want to. What did he do to me?—Just a game!"

"I don't know how to dress the dead..."

"What do I care about that? I don't know him, do you think I know him?"

"But he is dead after all!"

"Oh, so what? Don't persuade me. I don't want to see such a person... You shouldn't lie..."

In the end, she refused to dress him and stayed alone on the balcony.

When I was dressing the student Filipov for burial, I suddenly heard a low, heartbreaking sob. I ran out and went to the balcony.

Sometimes, it will make humans cry particularly, fiercely, and piercingly: Dora cried out with such tears. Kneeling on the floor. Hitting her head against the railing, sobbing, crying, making harsh hissing sounds, uttering such words:

"My tyrannical loved one, my little monster, my dearest, my unforgettable child..."

### "At the Edge of the World"

— By Fa Mathis

(Exhibited at the Shanghai Art to Aid Education Exhibition of World Famous Paintings)

### Casual Talks on Couplets

— By Zhan Weng

After Nanjing was recovered, the party members held a memorial service for Zheng Rong. Zhang Taiyan wrote a couplet saying: "You gentlemen are petty thieves and dogs, the dead cannot rest in peace. This place is a dragon crouching and a tiger crouching, ancient people's empty words." It can be said that laughter, scolding, and anger all become articles.

Tang Caichang mourned Tan Zhuangfei: "How long has it been since I parted with you, suddenly startled by the flying electricity; how can I bear to bring a twenty-year-old beheading friend, to go to the spring terrace together; idly gain a lone minister to go to the frontier, the flute is extremely mournful." "Near the supreme being for just over ten days, killed by a group of villains, willingly abandon four hundred million to be slaves and concubines, buried forever in hell; only leaving the three heroes of Fusang, sword energy touching the sky." Liang Rengong said that every word is vivid and pierces the heart. Also, Tan had a sentence before his death: "Looking at the door, I only think of Zhang Jian, enduring death for a moment to wait for Du Gen." Tang also had a sentence before his death: "Better to offer a head to die for a friend, no true face to see the demons." But I only feel desolate.

### Poems from Dream Outside the Building

— By Xu Chengyu

Watching Flowers

Changing feathers and moving palaces, the meaning is not true, rolling up the curtain gracefully is not for oneself; how many tears of beauty are known, who remembers the eighth month of spring at the banquet.

Answering a Guest

The drifting sorrowful guest arrives at the riverside village, the profound meaning first peeps into the gate of all mysteries; having long realized the solemnity of emptiness and form, why must I carve out an image of a statue; I am glad that the spiritual heart is still there, the poems still preserve the elegant way; I have been careful in concealing my name in order to achieve understanding, I am willing to discuss my whereabouts with you.

The ancient constant flow is also new, what is the reason for chastity without peeling and restoring; closing the door to wind and moon is all idle business, who is the master of the passing landscape; the distant ravines rise and fall, becoming eternal sighs, the wandering souls return to the island and are also close; with you, I intend to recognize this body in the subtle light of God.

### Two Prose Pieces

— By Zhi Mo

Newsboy

The newsboy, this green-clothed man of news, runs busily all day long.

He desperately spreads the seeds of truth for life, and delivers the gospel that the people pray for; from early morning to evening, he shouts loudly and hurries on his way; in the cold dawn, and in the dark and rainy night, he shouts in a long voice: "Selling newspapers!"

Every time I hear this weak shout, a kind of pitying thought immediately floods my heart. I think calmly: A newspaper, after the reporter's interview, the editor's arrangement, revision, and deletion, and the typesetter's typesetting and printing, I don't know how much hard work it has gone through before it is born into the hands of the newsboy to spread to the world...

However, in this economic turmoil and soaring prices, it is really submerged by war, and the gospel is replaced by tearing and killing. The entire page is filled with these ominous words, so people begin to hate and worry.

But the faithful newsboy still braves the cold and delivers this yesterday's history, today's spiritual food!

Raincoat and Love

I don't know who angered the rain god, forcing this cold winter rain to cry all day long...

People are very calm, never touching these sprinkled tears to proclaim the suffering of the earth to the world.

In this atomic age, raindrops dance on the glass; so, raincoats appear on the market, showing off to people—this messenger of love, delivering valuable gifts, begins to give them to the people he loves.

In the evening, in the dark courtyard, the conversation between men and women comes.

"Did you really accept someone else's raincoat?"

"How could I refuse!"

"Our love for these past few years..."

"Love! It can't protect against the rain!"

This winter rain tragedy ended and disappeared in the splashing sound.

So, the cold rain cried even more sadly...

### One Inch of Mountain and River, One Inch of Blood 170

— Ye Jingfeng

"After the raid, they will definitely suffer; even become angry. This anger, of course, will not reach us. Like those rascals, they are bound to vent their anger on the common people. For no reason, they will grab the common people and call them 'unstable elements.' After our raid, they can use this as an excuse to commit adultery, plunder, arson, and murder! Isn't it these innocent common people who are unlucky?... My opinion..."

When Hejian said this, he suddenly paused, as if the storyteller had reached the important point and announced "to be continued tomorrow", selling suspense. Presumably, he was also a bit dry-mouthed and tongue-tied. Hejian grabbed a cigarette and distributed one to me and Mr. W, each; at the same time, he looked at Yaoqun and Xiaohucheng with some apology; indicating that he could not provide anything other than cigarettes to suppress their nerves.

"My opinion is also to imitate Zhuge Kongming's secret: 'Think about retreating before thinking about advancing;' that is to say, before launching a raid, we should build a protective wall for the common people. On the other hand, we also have to make a safe plan for our subordinates; because we basically only have these few people with clear heads, this little bit of essence must not be wasted, or sacrificed excessively..."

Mr. W smiled with his bright eyes, but he did not interrupt, because he wanted to listen to know whether Hejian's plan was the same as his own.

"I am willing to take a trip first to find out the truth about their current situation, and then formulate a seemingly 'deceiving the heavens' method to blind them; and then use an effective safety method to give them a surprise attack, only giving them a severe lesson, so that they dare not move rashly——

"Mr. Feng, didn't you say that our base is a bit unstable? I also have to inquire about this point to see to what extent this instability has reached. I suspect we may be a bit paranoid?... "This sentence seemed to have a slight sting for Mr. W, but Hejian's sincerity in tone and expression rounded out the edges and corners of the words.

"Maybe;" Mr. W also expressed hesitation, "but I think it's best to clean up this paranoid fog completely; the safety of intelligence work must not be vague in the slightest, it must be practical! The 'deceiving the heavens' method you just proposed is just in our plan, and it is also the main purpose of my special request for advice——this method, I am afraid, will completely rely on you, brother...." Mr. W's expression drew a question mark.

"Okay!" Hejian also smiled cleverly. This is exactly the expression of "great minds think alike." "But I have to take advantage of that old man who is obsessed with the past——he likes to pretend to imitate the ancients, in reality, it is equivalent to monkeys doing tricks... Brother, is this the same method?"

Mr. W nodded with a smile. Immediately after, they studied the technology about the radio wave distance. I understood very well what they were up to, and Yaoqun had a lot of research on radio waves, and immediately gave them a good supplement. Only Little Tiger in the room not only did not understand the subject of this conversation, but also did not understand why the raid that they were just talking about so enthusiastically suddenly shifted to radio waves; so he stared blankly, paying attention to everyone's expressions.

We studied the time, location, method, aftermath, retreat, and other steps of the raid again from beginning to end. In the process of research, Yaoqun's contribution not only shocked Mr. W, but also stunned Hejian. Although he had controlled Yaoqun's academic process and time, he probably did not expect Yaoqun's academic ability to be so strong and her progress to be so advanced. In addition to admiration, he also felt a little ashamed, ashamed of what? It is in line with a common saying, "dogs look down on people"! I think he used to regard Yaoqun as an ordinary "unusual" woman; at most, he would put her on the same level as Pingzi. After this conversation, I think he will look at Yaoqun with a moderately elevated gaze.

### A Torch—One of the Essays on Life

— Cao Juren

Korolenko has a prose poem titled "A Torch." He said: "One dark autumn night, sailing in a dangerous river, no stars, no moon, the sky is dark, the earth is dark, everything is dark. Suddenly, I saw in front of the turning beach of the river, at the foot of the black mountain, a little torch was flashing. It flashes clearly and strongly, and is very close. I liked to say, "Ha, God bless, I'm about to get to my accommodation!" The rower turned his head and looked, and said lightly, "It's still far away!" I don't believe it, the torch is clearly in front, and it seems that it only takes two or three oars to reach it. However, the rower is experienced after all; our boat is still sailing in the river as black as ink for a long time. But that little torch is still in front, flashing and beckoning, always so close, and always so far away. Life is like sailing in such a dangerous river, the torch is still far away! But it is always in front, rowing up one oar at a time, and there will always be a time to arrive."

I first read this poem fifteen or sixteen years ago; the longer the years pass, I always remember: "Life is like sailing in such a dangerous river, that little torch, flashing in front, beckoning, always so close, and always so far away." Fifteen or sixteen years ago, I also happily welcomed that torch, thinking that "I was about to get to my accommodation"! Until today, I can only believe the rower's words: "It's still far away!" Our only belief is: Row up one oar at a time, and there will always be a time to arrive."

Free Talk

### At the Drama Festival Party

— Wind

People from the film and drama circles have all arrived, everyone said: "We are all one family!"

At the gate of the Municipal Drama School, a small archway celebrating the Drama Festival was built, just like the scenery on the stage. This is the first achievement that the students of the Drama School have shown to people.

At the signing place at the entrance of the hall on the fourth floor, many students from the Drama School stepped forward to greet people. The name of Tian Han on the signing paper was particularly large, and everyone had to take a look at it.

The exhibition hall is also together. The flat part is the information collected by Xu Muyun, including many photos, zaju collections, and facial makeup diagrams. The first exhibit was the list of operas celebrating the Double Tenth Festival when Zhang Xueliang supervised Shandong. There were about Shang Xiaoyun, Yu Shuyan, Mei Lanfang, Xun Huisheng, etc. participating in the performance, and Yang Xiaolou performed the finale, which greatly envied the opera fans.

In the part of the drama exhibition, there were many photos of the Moscow Art Theater, and many French theater photos, and the explanations were all in French. A guest who understood French was dragged to explain to others.

People from the drama and film circles have all arrived, and the students of the Drama School are busy asking their predecessors to sign their names. The names on their signature books are as complete as the names signed at the door.

The party began, Xiong Fuxi first gave a speech, and Gu Yiqiao. In the school, Xiong Fuxi is the chairman of the academic affairs committee, and Gu Yiqiao is the vice-chairman. Although the latter is the director of the Education Bureau, Old Xiong still takes the lead.

There were four kinds of snacks, including peanuts, sandwiches, beef, and yam chunks, all made by the students of the Drama School. It is said that there is an unlimited supply of wine, but the alcoholics are not interested in those cold yellow wines.

However, Xiong Fuxi was the most energetic. He repeatedly dragged others to toast, and also diligently entertained guests with peanuts, constantly saying in his mouth, "Peanuts are delicious, peanuts are really delicious?"

There was no scheduled performance program. Zhao Jingshen was coaxed onto the stage and sang a section of Kunqu opera. It was not enough, and he also performed the story of Zhang Sheng and Cui Yingying in "The West Chamber."

Wu Zuguang's talent for telling jokes is the best, and he can't escape it.

Ding Cong didn't have much to perform on stage. He said, "Everyone just watch me snore."

A guest performed "Ballet" in the waltz music, the dance was beautiful, and the people sitting also stood up to watch.

Due to the lack of programs, Xiong Fuxi and Wu Tian, as the hosts, dragged people to join in as soon as they saw them, making people dare not approach them.

There were many singing programs, although not all of them were satisfactory, the applause and applause were always endless.

The traffic on North Sichuan Road was congested, and the guests arrived later. Every time a senior gentleman arrived, the students of the Drama School who held the signature book were very busy. People can get to know many people because of this. This is Li Jianwu, that is Yu Ling...

People also know because of this that Xia Yan and Ying Lingwei did not arrive.

The four large fire vats in the hall are the most popular. Each fire vat is surrounded by people and there is no ventilation. People who do not know each other can also talk very harmoniously. "The drama circle is one family!" Everyone's heart is as hot as charcoal.

### Old Couplets and New Words

— Listening to Pine Trees

Zeng Wenzheng was most adept at creating couplets, and Zhang Wenxiang also often boasted of his own abilities. Many of the couplets created by Xiangxiang were widely praised, as the main point of couplets is their unwavering accuracy. It is inappropriate to use common phrases with the other party, and one's own identity and tone must also be perfectly matched to be truly wonderful. Apart from various long couplets, Nanpi was particularly skilled at using idioms, creating them naturally, unmatched in his time. When Li Hefei first became Chancellor, he was granted a birthday celebration that year. Wenxiang personally wrote a couplet to congratulate him, saying, "The court has appointed a Chancellor like Sima! Is the old man like a dragon?" The first line uses the "History of Song," referring to his initial appointment. The second line uses the "Tao Te Ching," referring to the surname Li. The superb and grand tone could not be matched by others, and the identity of the other party could only be worthy of it by Wenzhong. When Wenzhong reached his sixtieth birthday, talented and learned men in Wenxiang's staff proposed couplets, but none satisfied Nanpi. As the birthday celebration approached, Huang Zhonglian, a historian and Wenxiang's nephew-in-law, was also on staff. He casually mentioned that the current couplet might not surpass the previous one. Wenxi raised his beard and laughed, saying, "How can you underestimate me? I happened to think of a couplet yesterday evening, not only still using idioms, but also still being twelve characters." The whole room looked at each other in surprise, privately doubting its possibility. Nanpi immediately took up a brush on the prepared birthday congratulatory couplet paper and wrote, "Heaven gave birth to him for the sake of the country, people look up to him as if he were a celestial being." The first line comes from Tang Shou's eulogy to Li Beiping Fu Zhong, "Heaven gave birth to Li Sheng, for the sake of the country." The second line uses the story of Li Guo sharing the same boat. However, if this couplet were not for celebrating Wenzhong's birthday, and were applied to other Prime Ministers named Li, the identities would be entirely mismatched. The difficulty is not in the fact that both lines quote idioms, both referring to great men named Li, but in fitting Hefei's identity as a Prime Minister who calmed great chaos and achieved great success. However, it is fortunate that the surname Li has such historical figures; Zeng and Zuo might not have such suitable idioms. I heard this story from Mr. Huang Zhonglian while sitting with Shen Meisou. Meisou said: These two couplets stood out from the crowd, and were widely circulated, worthy of being called famous couplets. Not only could the master hand of Xiangxiang not surpass them, but even Ji Wenda's pure temple birthday couplets, although praising appropriately, could not overwhelm them in superb grandeur.

### Stealing Half a Day of Leisure - Introducing a Coffee Shop to You

— Zhang Wen

Shanghai's coffee shops were originally mostly exclusively for foreigners, especially in the past on Avenue Joffre. When the lights came on, there were quite a few White Russian nobles and Russian beauties in some smoky little coffee shops, either singing loudly or chanting softly, with a rather romantic atmosphere. Since the fashion of drinking coffee became popular among our upper-class Chinese, coffee shops exclusively for Chinese people have also sprung up like mushrooms. During the period when Shanghai was occupied, the coffee shop business had a golden age, and there was even a coffee king (CPC) capitalist. However, those coffee shops exclusively for Chinese people were often decorated tackily and charged high prices. As a result, some people who loved to drink coffee and paid attention to the atmosphere of coffee shops instead went to some coffee shops run by foreigners to find quieter places. During the enemy-puppet period, British and American customers were all locked up in concentration camps, and those coffee shops seized the opportunity to do business with Chinese people. As a result, several of them still have a lot of Chinese customers to this day.

Among these small coffee shops, the one named "Little," located opposite the Grand China Theatre, is the most familiar to everyone. Because of its good location, the business is also very good. There is also one called "Little" on Route Amiral Bayle. A relatively unfamiliar one is the Little Cafe Shop opposite the Cathay Theatre.

This shop is located on Avenue Joffre, facing north from the south. The word "frontage" is actually very inappropriate, it really only has a small entrance, with a cigarette counter placed there. Straight ahead is an escalator upstairs. It is indeed not easy to find unless you are a regular customer.

Going up the escalator, there are two doors, which will make you wonder which one to choose. When you pay attention to the sign on the door, and push the door open, you don't see anyone. It turns out that you have to turn a corner to get there. This point of twists and turns is very interesting to people.

When you pass through these twists and turns, and suddenly feel enlightened, a coffee room with three shop fronts appears before your eyes. I can't say how beautiful the decoration is, but the colors are well-coordinated. I remember that in the past, the place seemed to be a little bigger, but now it has been reduced in size. But here you can avoid some familiar friends that you don't want to run into, allowing you to spend a quiet afternoon or a lonely night alone, because not many Chinese people go here.

If you like to play pranks, you can also ask a friend to meet you there. When the time comes, you can watch from the window as they look around bewildered.

The interior decoration, with train-style seats against the wall by the windows, is not crowded, and the seats are quite comfortable. When the aroma of coffee and the smoke of cigars fill the room, looking around, all you see are blue eyes and blonde hair, which makes people feel as if they are in a foreign country.

The coffee here is not expensive, only a thousand or so yuan, but the cakes cannot be considered cheap. Each piece has a different price, about seven or eight thousand yuan a piece. But these are indeed made by them, and the taste is very good. There are a total of three or four Russian waitresses, who not only have to serve customers, but also have to serve customers who come to buy cakes separately.

The business is not very good, which makes it seem quiet and lovely. At least you won't run into some vulgar customers who shout loudly and talk loudly about market prices. "Stealing half a day of leisure," this is a pretty good place to go.

Film Talk

### "Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon"

— Ma Gao

This film will be officially released soon. The reporter happened to catch a preview and was deeply moved after watching it. Not only because it depicts the hardships suffered by educated youth in this era, but also because the reporter personally experienced the XuZhou breakout, the Changsha Victory, and the Xiang-Gui retreat, which are large events in the War of Resistance against Japan. In addition, I was also a member of the performing arts troupe and have personally experienced it, which makes me feel especially close.

This is a bloody and tearful history of countless small characters of the great era who devoted themselves to the War of Resistance and engaged in cultural performance work. The author uses the characters of Li Bin and Ling Yu to thread through nine years, from the city to the countryside, from the battlefield to the wartime capital, and even to the post-"bitter victory" repatriation to Shanghai. He extracts a few characteristic stages of their nine-year life in a summary fashion and records the life, work, and education of some young friends around them. It can also be said that it is a "history of the performing arts troupe." Therefore, it makes people feel that there are too many side branches and leaves, long and lacking in the power to develop characters. If the personalities of the two characters Ling Yu and Li Bin are more prominent and vivid, the degree of emotional appeal will be deeper and more profound.

Intellectuals are the most sensitive and the most courageous. They are the first to feel the tide of every era, and they are the first to throw themselves into it regardless of everything. However, they are also very fragile and often easily retreat. Of course, it is not to say that all intellectuals will retreat. Like the group portrayed in this film, they stick to their posts without seeking fame, unmoved by profit and desire. (The fact that the performing arts troupe still exists today is the best proof). However, in recent years, many friends who once lived bravely have not only had their lifestyles changed under the cruel reality, but even the thoughts and desires that once surged in their hearts have cooled down and gradually turned a big corner. Then, this film will provide you with some memory material from the past, allowing you to face your own weakness and criticize the present.

On one side is obscene and shameless, on the other side is serious work. In addition to the soldiers who risked their lives in battle, the cultural workers who worked diligently with their conscience contributed the most during the War of Resistance against Japan. But now, who has the fruit of victory fallen into? What kind of image has the beautiful scene of victory that has been fantasized about day and night for eight years become? Cultural workers are still living a life of torment, all of which is thought-provoking.

This film is a good film worth introducing to the audience. Whether it is acting, directing, or cinematography, it is very upright and has put in some effort. Mr. Shi Dongshan is an accomplished, well-known, serious film worker, and having such success is very reasonable. Now that we have seen this film, we feel that Chinese cinema is not hopeless, and that the power of Hollywood will not forever occupy our market. Because it has not yet been officially released, this is just an introduction.
