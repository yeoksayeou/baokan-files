### Sheng Ming of the Materials Supply Bureau: United Press Report Inaccurate

The U.S. Has Not Delivered 500 Million Yuan Worth of Materials to Us

[Central News Agency, This City] Regarding the news about the remaining U.S. materials shipped to China, reported by the United Press Washington dispatch on July 22, as published in various newspapers in this city on the 24th, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan issued the following statement: The figures in the Washington dispatch may cause the general public to misunderstand the total value of the remaining materials China has obtained so far, and it is necessary to explain. According to the agreement of August 30, 1946, the estimated total amount (calculated at cost) of movable materials that the U.S. government intends to transfer to our country is 500 million U.S. dollars, of which only materials and equipment worth 170 million U.S. dollars have been declared as surplus materials. The entire amount of these materials may not be completely obtained by China, as this declaration may be hindered or withdrawn. Regarding the large-scale sale of 500 million yuan worth of movable materials, up to June 30, 1947, China actually obtained approximately 71 million U.S. dollars. As for the statement that the United States has transferred to China within nine months, or allocated to the surplus materials category, materials worth 500 million U.S. dollars according to cost value, this is an erroneous report. According to the agreement of August 30, 1946, the U.S. government still needs to transfer surplus materials worth 330 million U.S. dollars to China.

### A Prominent Economist Advocates Immediate Currency Reform; Believes This Move is the Key to Resolving the Current Economic Crisis

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] A prominent economist close to the government solemnly pointed out to reporters on the 25th that currency reform is the main key that can be used to resolve the current economic crisis. Although this move cannot achieve a complete cure, if preparations are sufficient, considerations are thorough, and there is the courage to implement it resolutely, it is feasible to implement it now. He likened currency reform to a seriously ill patient seeking medical treatment. He said that the severity of our current economic situation is like a patient with a disease entering the critical stage. If we continue to avoid seeking medical treatment, we will surely die. Seeking medical treatment, although it may not necessarily bring a miraculous cure, is still better than dying without treatment.

Those who oppose immediate currency reform believe that currency reform must first meet the following three preconditions: (1) political stability, (2) balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure, (3) stable prices. He believes that this view is too idealistic and puts the cart before the horse. If the above three points have already been achieved, then why would we need currency reform? In terms of the current situation, since turmoil cannot be resolved by other methods in the short term, the only way is to suppress the rebellion. If the government can stabilize the currency value in a non-combat zone, then production and other aspects can be put back on track. At this time, suppressing the rebellion will also be extremely useful. If we must wait until the situation is clear before reforming the currency system, then the current situation is extremely obvious. A chaotic currency system will surely make investors and producers hesitate, and production will decline. Wouldn't the driving force for suppressing the rebellion be affected by this? Therefore, due to the instability of the situation, currency reform is even more needed.

In terms of balancing finances, the main source of financial revenue is taxation. Under the current situation of daily currency depreciation, the tax revenue collected last month is used for national treasury expenditures this month, and its value has been reduced by half. How can national income be increased and how can the budget be balanced? Only with a stable currency value can revenue and expenditure be calculated and then balanced. This point should also be clarified.

He also cited various reasons to explain the positive effects that currency reform can have. He said that because the currency system cannot be reformed immediately and because the government has adopted a pegged exchange rate policy, overseas remittances are fleeing to Hong Kong one after another. Although there are methods such as anti-smuggling, smuggling still exists. At the same time, funds from Wuhan and other places are also flowing south, which is a great loss to the country. After currency reform, this phenomenon should no longer occur.

He pointed out that due to various reasons, currency reform is essential, and to reform, it is best to implement it immediately. If we continue to procrastinate, even by the end of this year, the danger will be unimaginable. By then, the losses that the country will incur due to not reforming the currency system will be much greater than the risks of reforming it now. The first requirement for currency reform is that the new currency should be linked to the U.S. dollar. Because our country's currency is one of the world's currencies, it cannot be separated from world relations. This link can have a stabilizing effect on the psychology of the people. In the future, those with floating funds will not have to rush to buy U.S. dollars or engage in speculation. According to his estimation, if we use our existing foreign exchange and gold, plus the funds remitted back by overseas Chinese, as the reserve for the new currency, and at the same time impose slight restrictions on foreign trade, based on last year's international trade balance, this number can be sustained for at least one year and more. If there is international support, it will be even less of a problem.

When asked how to deal with the existing legal tender after the new currency is issued, he replied that Russia used two currencies simultaneously at that time, which is also a method. When the new currency is first issued, a flexible exchange rate can be set between the new currency and the old currency, which can be adjusted according to the situation. At the same time, the issuance of the old currency will be stopped, and the old currency will be recovered with the new currency. Since the issuance of the new currency is open and the people have absolute faith in the new currency, the old currency will also be recovered in the shortest possible time. After currency reform, the government can implement small-scale production plans, and private production can also flourish with security. The national budget can also be gradually balanced with a stable currency value.

This economist, who did not want to reveal his name, also expressed his support for the currency reform section of the recent economic reform plan passed by the National Economic Commission. He pointed out that if the currency is not reformed, the economy can never be improved. At the same time, the plan states that "the government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the currency system." What is the so-called "appropriate time"? Currently, the price of goods in our country has increased by 50,000 times, and the price of some metal materials has increased by more than 100,000 times. This multiple is not found in any country in ancient or modern times. If we do not reform the currency system now, must we wait until the price of goods has increased by 200,000 times before reforming it? He also does not agree with the authorities' secrecy about currency reform, believing that except for the price of the new currency and the British exchange rate, everything else should be openly discussed.

His conclusion is that currency reform is not a "cure-all." After the reform, all economic problems will not be solved immediately, but the reform is ultimately better than no reform, and immediate reform is better than reforming it in the future. If the government can have the determination and consider the gains and losses in detail, then it is feasible to implement the reform at this time.

### The Executive Legal Regulations Review Committee Was Approved by the Executive Yuan Yesterday; National Administrative Bureaus' Headquarters Must Move to Nanjing Before the End of the Year

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Ministry of the Interior, in preparation for the implementation of the Constitution, believes that the various articles listed in Chapter 10 of the Constitution concerning the powers of the central and local governments, which are inconsistent with the current laws and organizations, should be revised and determined to define the powers of the central and local governments. This matter is also related to the ongoing reorganization of local governments. After internal research and consultation with relevant ministries and commissions, the Ministry of the Interior drafted opinions and submitted them to the Executive Yuan, requesting the establishment of an Executive Legal Regulations Review Committee to hold regular meetings to study. This proposal was passed at the third temporary meeting of the Zhengzi on the 25th, and it was decided to establish an Executive Legal Regulations Review Committee, composed of several political affairs committee members, with the participation of relevant ministries and commissions, or inviting other experts to participate. The list of candidates has not yet been determined. The following are the points researched by the Ministry of the Interior on the implementation procedures of the various articles listed in Chapter 10 of the Constitution, which are intricately related and cannot be clearly divided: (1) Article 107: Matters legislated and implemented by the central government, which require the assistance of provinces and counties for implementation, such as the division of national tax, provincial tax, and county tax, should be analyzed. (2) Article 108: Matters legislated and implemented by the central government, or delegated to provinces and counties for implementation, which should be implemented by the central government, which should be delegated to provinces and counties for implementation, and in which stage of the implementation process should belong to the central government, which should belong to the province, and which should belong to the county. (3) Article 109: Matters legislated and implemented by the province, or delegated to the county for implementation, and Article 110: Matters legislated and implemented by the county, except for provincial and municipal administration, the remaining items are the same. In these same items, how should the part belonging to the province and the part belonging to the county be clearly divided.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] At the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 25th, a temporary motion was passed, stating that the headquarters (bureaus) or subsequent management offices of national administrative bureaus that are still in Shanghai must move to Nanjing before the end of this year, and a plan for the relocation must be submitted for approval within one month. The motion was passed.

### At the Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Council, Yu Hongjun Reports on Finance; China's Import Surplus Gradually Improves

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun attended the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Council on the morning of the 25th and reported on the financial situation of the past two years.

(1) The Ministry of Finance has recently been managing financial issues. Since the victory two years ago, the government has been seeking peace every day, but peace has not yet been achieved. Therefore, people's minds are unsettled, society cannot be stable, and market panic and merchant speculation have spread in the gold market, causing price fluctuations and currency depreciation. These phenomena are mutually causal, and the Ministry of Finance has been dealing with them at all times. Since the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order, we are planning to strictly implement frugality and increase revenue in order to stabilize the financial economy. The government believes that it can overcome difficulties. After the implementation of the Emergency Economic Measures, general prices have stabilized and fallen, but this plan interferes with economic behavior with political power. Although it can be effective for a while, it cannot last for long. In order to seek long-term stability, it should be implemented in conjunction with peacetime measures.

(2) In terms of tax revenue, the only reasonable way to increase revenue is to increase taxes. The measures that have been taken are: 1. The collection of direct taxes in 1947. The audit process has aroused opposition from the Shanghai business community, which believes that the accounting personnel are corrupt and the procedures are cumbersome. It has now been decided to simplify the tax collection process so that it can proceed smoothly. 2. The special business tax has begun to be implemented, but the pacification areas are exempt from tax for one year. 3. The commodity tax rate was originally scheduled to be adjusted once every three months, but in order to increase revenue, it has been decided to adjust and increase it at any time according to the actual wholesale price. 4. Property tax. The Ministry of Finance previously drafted the "One-Time Property Tax" method. After discussion by the National Economic Commission, and in view of the fact that the collection of property tax in Germany and Belgium has failed, it was changed to "National Reconstruction Special Contribution." The Ministry of Finance has drafted specific measures for this, the main points of which are: 1. Individuals are the target. 2. Includes movable and immovable property. 3. Levied from 500 million yuan. 4. The procedure is: 1. Declaration, 2. Nomination, 3. County and municipal governments and local public opinion organizations form an investigation committee to investigate it. The central government will set up a supervision committee. 5. The central part is collected by the Direct Tax Bureau, and the local part is handled by the county and municipal governments. The tax revenue situation is as described above, but it still cannot achieve a balance of payments.

(3) Customs anti-smuggling. Smuggling is particularly rampant in the South China area. We are now setting up checkpoints on land and water and deploying patrol fleets to strengthen anti-smuggling and strictly prevent armed smuggling.

(4) Import and export trade situation. In the past year, China's total imports were 150.11 billion yuan, and total exports were 41.2 billion yuan, a ratio of approximately 4 to 1. From January to May of this year, total imports were 180.93 billion yuan, and total exports were 90.13 billion yuan. The import surplus for the past five months was 90.8 billion yuan. However, proportionally, exports accounted for one-third of imports from January to March, two-fifths in April, and four-fifths in May. The import surplus is gradually decreasing, and the situation has improved.

(5) Financial control measures. On the one hand, we are cracking down on unsound banks, and at the same time strengthening control. For urban financial institutions, we are providing effective supervision. On the one hand, we are tightening credit, but the Central Bank should still handle the allocation of legitimate funds and the granting of production loans.

(6) US loan issues. After Special Envoy Wedemeyer came to China, we provided various relevant information on the financial situation for research purposes. However, we should still seek a solution from the political aspect. If we have a solution in the political or military aspects, the United States may agree to the loan. After Yu's report, Senators Wu Zhaoxu and Xue Mingjian raised several oral inquiries: (1) The tax system is good, but the tax collectors are not good, so merchants use two sets of books, making the audit method ineffective. Therefore, the tax system should be reconsidered. (2) Is a 50,000 yuan banknote about to be issued? (3) How to balance the budget, etc. Yu replied briefly as follows: (1) Although the tax collectors are not good, they still need to be supervised, and please help from the North and assist in inspection. (2) To balance the budget and subsidize the difference, we still use issuance to remedy it. If we seek a solution by increasing tax revenue, the burden on the people will be too heavy. (3) Regarding the foreign exchange linkage system in North China, the National Economic Commission is studying it. (4) The issuance of a 50,000 yuan banknote is unfounded.

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] The Standing Committee of the Political Council held a regular meeting on the morning of the 25th, chaired by Jiang Yong. Jiang You

(A) Secretariat Report: (1) The Political Council previously planned to form a delegation to inspect and comfort the Northeast and Taiwan. The official department stated that it is not necessary to organize it for the time being. (2) The Civil Service Department sent a letter stating that the quota of Communist Party senators has been cancelled. It also reported that the senators who had previously been appointed officials or died have not been re-elected. Therefore, the seven vacant seats of Communist Party senators will not be filled. The secretariat has submitted a list to the National Government.

(B) Written Diplomatic Report: (1) The issue of the peace treaty with Japan is divided into two parts: one is the preliminary meeting to study the draft, and the other is the location of the peace conference. We have agreed to the former, and our government believes that the location of the peace conference should be held in Shanghai. (2) The negotiation process of the Sino-British air transport agreement. (3) We have agreed to the exchange of ambassadors between China and Burma. Then Finance Minister Yu Hongjun reported on finance and answered questions (Yu's report can be found on the first page).

The discussion of the proposals continued: (1) Please ask the government to postpone trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty with Japan. (2) It is proposed to ask the government to postpone opening trade with Japan. The above two proposals were discussed together and it was decided to submit them to the full review committee for discussion and then to the next meeting for approval. (3) Zheng Kuiyi et al. proposed "Please ask the government to retain the right of veto on the Japanese peace treaty in order to strive for an active role in the peace treaty, and to have this council participate in the organization of the delegation to the peace treaty with Japan in order to strengthen the diplomatic lineup." It was decided to submit it to the government for handling. (4) Xue Mingjian et al. proposed "It is proposed to ask the government to issue an order to all educational institutions to ensure that those engaged in educational undertakings at all levels can stay in their positions for a long time and enjoy their careers for life." It was decided to submit it to the government for reference. (5) Wu Chunwu proposed: "Eliminate feudal labor and implement democratic politics. Warlords should not be provincial governors." It was decided to submit it to the government for handling.

### Contents of the Proposal by Zheng Kuiyi et al.

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] The proposal of Senator Zheng Kuiyi et al., which was passed by the Standing Committee of the Political Council today, states: "Please ask the government to retain the right of veto on the peace treaty with Japan in order to strive for an active role in the peace treaty, and to have this council participate in the organization of the delegation to the peace treaty with Japan in order to strengthen the diplomatic lineup." The contents are as follows:

"Our country was the first country to resist Japanese aggression. The eight-year war of resistance resulted in heavy losses. The peace treaty with Japan is not only to settle the past decades of Japanese aggression, but also to affect the rise and fall of the country's future and world peace. If the policies are wrong and the response is inappropriate, there will be endless disasters. Since the United States has been controlling Japan, its support has been obvious. This time, it invited the Far Eastern Allies to discuss the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, which has its own national policy. The interests of the countries concerned are different, and their policies are also different. The government is facing this important task entrusted by the people. It should gather ideas and benefit widely. The council should participate in the organization of the delegation to the peace treaty with Bai in order to strengthen the diplomatic lineup. At the same time, it must insist on the right of veto on the peace treaty in order to strive for an active role. Measures: (1) Please ask the government to retain the right of veto on the Japanese peace treaty as a condition for participating in the peace conference. (2) The council will participate in the organization of the delegation to the peace treaty with Japan."

### Before the Peace Treaty with Japan is Signed, Trade Should Be Postponed; Two Proposals by Senators are Combined for Review

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] Most senators do not agree with the opening of trade with Japan. The following two proposals were discussed at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Council on the morning of the 25th: (1) Zheng Kuiyi, Jiang Yong, Peng Ge, Chen et al. proposed: "Please ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty with Japan." (2) Xue Mingjian et al. proposed: "It is proposed to ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan." The proposers explained in detail that once trade with Japan is opened, it will be tantamount to destroying our country's industry and commerce. The government should be immediately asked to consider postponing the opening. Senator Zhang Qianhua was opposed to this, believing that the opening of trade with Japan was announced by MacArthur, and we should respect MacArthur's proposal. In the end, it was decided to submit the two proposals to the full review committee for review and to the next meeting of the Standing Committee for discussion. The full review committee is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 26th. The contents of the two proposals are recorded as follows:

Proposal by Zheng Kuiyi et al.

Zheng Kuiyi and two others proposed: Please ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty with Japan.

Reasons: Our country was forced to resist Japan for eight years. The people were displaced, and the villages were turned into ruins. Two years after the victory, the peace treaty with Japan, which the whole country is paying attention to, has not yet been signed, but the aggressor is already trying to expand and revive. Public opinion is confused, and people's minds are uneasy. At present, the government is busy suppressing the rebellion and lacks a clear attitude towards diplomacy. Although it wants to maintain the magnanimity of a great nation towards Japan, it should first sign the peace treaty and then open trade, and then help Japan embark on the road of democracy. All of these should be done in a normal and reasonable procedure. Unexpectedly, the commander of the Allied occupation, without first seeking the consent of the Allied countries, arbitrarily allowed the Japanese government to open foreign trade from August 15th of this year. Our industry, commerce, and public opinion have successively spoken out, appealing to the government to consider stopping the opening, but they have not been adopted. The news reported that the political meeting on the 22nd of this month expressed support for the principle of opening. This is a very important national policy. How can this council remain silent? (1) For the past two years, the Allied occupying authorities have been implementing US national policy and want to open up Japan's foreign trade in order to reduce the US burden of occupying Japan. The United States is a highly developed industrial country and is not worried about being affected by Japanese goods dumping. Our country's production is backward and cannot follow the United States step by step. It needs to have an independent and self-reliant trade policy with Japan that is different from that of the United States. (2) The Japanese government plans to export materials in the current year, mainly yarn, silk, raw silk, and rayon, in exchange for cotton, wool, and raw materials or products of heavy industry. It plans to import salt, soybeans, sugar, etc. from China, which will objectively put China's industry in a state of depression. (3) After the war, our country's industry is just budding. If Japanese goods are allowed to flood in and compete with American goods in the markets, then the finished products with Shanghai wages that are seven times higher than those of Japan will be seriously hit, and the market for domestic goods in the Nanyang Islands will disappear. (4) China and Japan are neighbors, and there is a principle of communication between them. The opening of trade is only a matter of time. In order to prepare for a rainy day, we should promptly invite representatives from industrial and commercial experts and people's organizations to widely solicit opinions and formulate a trade policy with Japan in order to strive for an active role.

Measures: (1) Please ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing the peace treaty. (2) Convene representatives from people's organizations and recruit industrial and commercial experts to formulate a trade plan in order to strive for an active role in trade with Japan.

Proposal by Xue Mingjian et al.

Xue Mingjian et al. proposed: It is proposed to ask the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan.

Reasons: (1) The peace treaty has not yet been signed, and compensation has not yet been fulfilled. Our country has no need to open trade with Japan in terms of law. (2) Japan has announced plans to export 500,000 US dollars more to our country in trade this year, continuing its economic aggression, which is self-evident. (3) All conditions for developing national industry are unfavorable. (4) The eight-year war of resistance, the bloodstains have not dried, and the pain is still there. Whether it is industry, commerce, or the entire people, there is absolutely no desire to trade with Japan in the shortest period of time. (5) Since the victory, Japanese goods have disappeared from the Chinese market and have no impact on people's lives, which shows that there is no value in considering trade with Japan.

Measures: In order to communicate with Japan, the method of bartering with Japan in the past can be improved or expanded. Once the compensation issue is resolved and the trade agreement is signed, trade with Japan will be opened.

### Five Supervisory Committee Members Decide to Make Another Proposal

[Report from our Nanjing on the 25th] The five Supervisory Committee members, Wan Can et al., believe that the government has not adopted their urgent motion to stop opening trade with Japan. They are now drafting another proposal to strengthen the reason for stopping opening trade with Japan. This proposal may be submitted within a few days.

### Zhang Qun Talks About MacArthur's Lack of Understanding of Japan

The US Government and Public Are Too Optimistic

[Report from this newspaper] Zhang Junli said at yesterday's press conference: In the peace conference with Japan, our country must demand the complete disarmament of Japan in order to guarantee peace. The so-called democratization of Japan is actually superficial and not thorough, just a drama used to fool the United States. MacArthur does not understand Japan enough, and the US government and the public are too optimistic about Japan. For example, the United States allows Japan to restore its industrial level in 1937, which is actually impossible because this level was originally based on imported raw materials.

### Representatives of the National Federation of Industries Petition to Various Agencies

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 25th] The National Federation of Industries, in order to oppose the opening of trade with Japan, sent directors and supervisors Wu Yun Chu, Hu Bo Xiang, Tao Gui Lin, Tian He Xiang, etc. to various relevant agencies on the 25th to petition. Chen Qitian received them on behalf of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and stated that (1) the government will carefully plan and strictly limit trade with Japan; (2) the 64 merchants sent to Japan have a detailed classification, and their reputation in the business community is strictly reviewed; (3) the Ministry of Economic Affairs is willing to consider and accept the opinions raised by the representatives of the Industrial Association as much as possible. Li Tang received them on behalf of the Ministry of Finance and comforted the representatives, saying that they did not need to worry too much and that the government would have a solution. Liang Ying Zhi, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, received them on behalf of the Executive Yuan and discussed the opinions raised in detail with the representatives, promising to forward them to President Zhang.

### MacArthur Approves Loan to Help Japan Restore Coal Mines

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur has approved a loan of 11.14 billion yen to 23 designated coal mining companies. These companies own 90% of the total coal mines in Japan. This loan is designated to be used to restore Japanese coal mines and expand equipment. Allied officials pointed out that this loan is intended to increase domestic coal mines in Japan as a starting point for economic recovery. It is expected that after the Japanese coal mining industry receives this loan, it can increase the current annual coal production of 14 million tons to 30 million tons by 1948. Among these 23 coal mines, Mitsui Mining Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Mining Co., Ltd. received the largest amount of loans. Mitsui received 363 million yen, and Mitsubishi received 263 million yen.

Allied Nations Will Allow Japan to Use Gold and Jewels

[United Press, Washington, 24th] It was learned here today that the Allied Nations will, through the Far East Commission, advise MacArthur to use the country's gold and jewels to help its industrial recovery, in accordance with the policy of allowing Japan to resume private trade. This asset of Japan can be worth more than 150 million US dollars, enough to purchase foreign raw materials, so that factories that are now closed can be put into operation to meet the demand of foreign businessmen after the opening of private trade on August 15th. Although Japan's financial resources of gold and jewels are not enough to meet all of its industrial needs, they are also enough to quickly serve as initial funds for purchasing raw materials from abroad. This gold and jewels of Japan was originally designated for compensation. It may not be necessary to change the original intention, because MacArthur is ordered to sell it to obtain US dollars to pay for the raw materials, but it is also stipulated that Japan must find a way to redeem it for compensation when the countries concerned request distribution.

Allied Headquarters Plans to Set a Temporary Exchange Rate for the Yen As Soon As Possible

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] According to the Jiji News Agency, the Japanese Trade and Exchange Headquarters believes that setting a foreign exchange rate for the yen as soon as possible is beneficial to Japanese trade. Therefore, the Provisional Hall also hopes to set a rate in the near future. Although the exact number of the exchange rate is not yet known, it is believed that one US dollar will be approximately equal to 100 to 200 yen. The amount is set before the arrival of foreign businessmen so that Japan can achieve economic independence and the occupation work can succeed as soon as possible. However, it is not yet known whether foreign businessmen will be satisfied with this.

### Fifth International Statistical Conference Scheduled to be Held in Washington; We Have Appointed Chief and Deputy Representatives to Attend

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] According to relevant sources, the Grand World Statistical Conference and the 20th meeting of the International Statistical Society will be held in Washington from September 8th to 18th of this year.

### The Soviet Union's Reply to the Issue of the Peace Conference with Japan Arrives in Washington; The United States Insists on the Original Proposal

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] A spokesman for the US State Department announced today that the Soviet Union's reply to the US proposal to hold an eleven-nation peace conference with Japan was telegraphed to Washington this morning by US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith. The spokesman said that the United States believes that the Soviet note is a counter-proposal, not a "complete rejection." The Soviet Union proposes that the foreign ministers of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union should first draft the peace treaty in accordance with the procedure for the German peace treaty. US officials said that the United States insists on an eleven-nation conference, but the United States may agree if other countries prefer to delay the conference date. The only replies that the State Department has announced to have received so far are from Britain, New Zealand, Australia, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. It is believed that the replies from other countries have also been sent to the State Department, but have not yet been announced.

### National Food Conference Postponed by One Day

[Our Nanjing Office, 25th] The National Food Conference for the 36th year, originally scheduled to open on the 26th, has been postponed by one day to the morning of the 27th due to the late arrival of delegates from various regions and incomplete preparations.

### Hankou Executive Yuan Announces: Ban on Grain Exports Lifted

[Our Hankou Office, 25th] As the autumn harvest is approaching and the grain supply is sufficient, the Executive Yuan hereby announces the abolishment of the ban on grain exports, effective immediately.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 25th] New grains from counties such as Xiaogan in Hubei have already entered the market, causing grain prices in Wuhan to fall. The current assessed price of polished rice is 160,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), new unhusked rice is 46,000 to 56,000 yuan per shi, and Qi rice is 80,000 to 93,300 yuan per shi.

### Zhejiang Province Grain Enters Market; Grain Prices Drop in Various Counties

[Our Hangzhou Office, 25th] Rice prices in Hangzhou are stable, with the lowest price for brown rice still at 265,000 yuan. The wholesale price for mechanically steamed rice is 316,000 yuan.

### Yellow River Rises in Shandong; Zhukou Faces Imminent Danger; Engineering Teams Brave Death to Rush Repairs

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] The dikes on the south bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong are crucial to the lives and property of millions of people in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. This spring, after the National Army had just recovered the area, Kong Lingrong, director of the Shandong Dike Repair Department, personally led technicians and workers to the site for construction. The project was arduous, and the time was extremely pressing. They worked hard day and night to rush repairs. By mid-June, the most important dangerous areas of Zhukou and Dongzhuang and the soil work on the upper section of the dike had been rushed to completion. More than 40,000 laborers from the five counties of Heze, Puyang, Fanxian, Shou, and Yuncheng were being conscripted, and engineering teams and repair teams were dispatched to rush the soil work on the middle and lower sections of the dike and the dangers of Zhonggudui, Yangji, Lilou, and Wanglaoji. It was hoped that all repairs could be completed before the floodwaters rose. Unexpectedly, before the repairs were completed, communist bandits crossed the river on a large scale on June 30, harassing everywhere. The staff of the Shandong Dike Repair Department were the first to bear the brunt, with 45 members captured. The rest were forced to withdraw because the work could not continue. According to reports from personnel left behind underground, the river water continued to rise by 1.3 meters from the 1st to the 17th. Danger signs appeared at the 53rd and 2nd dams of Zhukou. On the 22nd, the Shandong Dike Repair Department dispatched a voluntary repair team to brave death and rush to protect them.

[Another Telegram] Ge Yunfang, chief engineer of the Shandong Dike Repair Department's western Shandong office, led a team of three engineering team leaders and more than 20 technicians, and they left Bian on a truck on the 23rd, arriving in Dongming that night. On the 24th, they rushed to Zhukou to supervise the emergency repairs.

### Communist Bandits Obstruct River Defense; Kidnap Personnel and Loot Equipment

### Editorial: Facing China's Current Situation Head-On

——Welcoming General Wedemeyer's Arrival in Shanghai

President Truman's special envoy, General Wedemeyer, has arrived in China with a team of experts. According to the published information, their purpose is to investigate the facts and make a correct assessment of the Chinese situation. This newspaper has already published an article welcoming the General's visit to the East. Now, as the General arrives in Shanghai, we would like to point out some aspects of China's current situation. We must first point out that the current Chinese situation is not simple and is the result of many years of evolution. Its current state has a historical background. Any assessment of the Chinese situation must correctly estimate this historical factor. Since the order to mobilize for the suppression of the rebellion was issued, China has returned to a wartime system. We have just achieved the victorious end of the war against Japan, and now we are engaged in another war. This was not the original expectation of the Chinese people. However, they feel that in the current situation, there is no other way to follow except to mobilize for the suppression of the rebellion and complete constitutional governance. After eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, what the Chinese people hoped for, and what the Chinese government spared no effort to seek through repeated concessions, was the restoration of peace and order, so that the people and the country could have a chance to breathe. However, the communist bandits fundamentally disregard the interests of the people and the nation. They are dividing and occupying territory, harming the country and the people. After much pain and reflection, the people of the whole country believe that if the communist bandits are not eliminated, the country will never have peace. At this time, we should use a spirit of decisiveness and courage to perform surgery on this malignant tumor that harms the country and the nation and remove it. The government yielded to the will of the people and issued the order to mobilize for the suppression of the rebellion. Now that the order to suppress the rebellion has been issued, the central focus of the joint efforts of the government and the people of the whole country in the future will be on suppressing the rebellion. This is the goal of all current efforts.

However, as mentioned earlier, the development of the Chinese situation to the current stage is the result of years of evolution and is not an accidental event. Politically, its development to the current stage is inextricably linked to the evolution of the international situation in recent years. In the political sphere, the development of the Chinese situation to the current stage is mainly due to China inheriting a legacy over which it had no will to express: Yalta. At a time when the Nazis were on the verge of collapse and Japan's fate was already sealed, the establishment of this "gentleman's agreement" caused the kind of situation that is now appearing in China. In order to accept this legacy over which it had not expressed its will, China made great concessions and signed a treaty with the Soviet Union with the feeling of a brave man cutting off his arm, reaffirming friendly relations. In the meantime, China's friend, the late President Roosevelt, also passed away, leaving President Truman to take on his unfinished business. It cannot be said that this is a major key to why the Chinese situation has the current state after the war.

President Truman took over the unfinished business of the late President Roosevelt and appointed Marshal Marshall as his special envoy to mediate in China. The Marshal, in his retirement, did not hesitate to travel thousands of miles to the East. The Chinese people expressed their high respect and heartfelt expectations. However, it is regrettable that the Marshal's efforts over the past year have failed to make the communist bandits, who harm the country and the people, abandon their views or make any concessions in order to restore domestic unity and peace. During Marshal Marshall's stay in China, the communist bandits launched a large-scale anti-American movement and openly slandered the government. Marshal Marshall was well aware of their actions. The failure of Marshal Marshall's year-long efforts in China also clearly shows that the Chinese situation is developing under the shadow of a larger international situation. Any effort to separate the Chinese situation from the world situation will not only be of no benefit to improving the Chinese situation, but can even be said to be harmful. We must view the Chinese situation from a correct angle in order to have a clear understanding of it and make a correct assessment of it.

In this situation, the Chinese government has implemented political reforms as much as possible within its power. The convening of the National Assembly and the drafting of the Constitution have laid a solid foundation for China's democratic constitutional government in the future. Even before party rule was implemented, the government voluntarily abolished the one-party rule system in order to express its determination to start anew with the people and return power to the people. Today's Chinese government includes three political parties and non-partisan social elites. The foundation of the government has been expanded. It can be said that the Chinese government has made its best efforts.

In terms of the economy, the current economic difficulties faced by China are inextricably linked to the evolution of the Chinese political situation. The existence of the communist bandits makes a thorough reform of the Chinese economy, including a thorough reform of the monetary system, impossible. Strictly speaking, unless this malignant tumor in the Chinese political situation is removed, all fundamental treatments will be ineffective. Taking the reform or reorganization of the monetary system as an example, our government has long been determined to do so. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan has also said that because of the communist bandits' rebellion, it is not yet time to reorganize or reform the monetary system. However, the government should do its best to save the current economic decline within its power. It cannot abandon this responsibility. This is why we see various economic controls, including controls on imports and exports. Since there are controls, there are restrictions on freedom. In this situation, restrictions on freedom are unavoidable. The implementation of control policies may cause inconvenience to American businessmen in China, in particular. They have just given up their "privileges," and now they are encountering wartime controls instead of peacetime freedom. It is understandable that those who are promoting Sino-American business relations feel this way. But we want to point out that the Chinese government does not believe that the current control measures cannot be modified at all. As long as the reasons are sufficient, we firmly believe that the Chinese government is ready to accept suggestions to revise them. As for the complexity and delay of procedures, and the occasional lack of dedication among civil servants, the government is also paying attention to them at all times and trying to improve them. China is currently in an extraordinary period, and we should have great patience.

In short, the current Chinese economic situation is inextricably linked to the political situation, and the development of the political situation to the current stage is related to the international situation. To thoroughly improve the Chinese economic situation, we must clarify the Chinese political situation. This is why the central focus of the joint efforts of the government and the people at present is on suppressing the rebellion and building the country. We must eliminate the chaos before we can talk about construction. As for the international situation, there is currently the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, which are of great benefit to clarifying the international situation. However, how the evolution of the international situation will be reflected in China depends on how our neighbors conduct themselves. Needless to say, what the Chinese people expect is that our wartime allies, our neighbors across the Pacific Ocean, can have a more obvious and active expression. This is not only related to the Chinese and Far Eastern situations, but also to the entire lasting peace of the world.

The cabinet leader should be called the Prime Minister, and his cabinet members should be called Ministers. If Burma decides to secede from the British Commonwealth and become independent, both sides should strive to maintain the most sincere relationship and take practical steps to achieve this goal.

He pointed out that there are only one hundred and sixty-eight Americans in the Soviet Union, while there are eight hundred and ten Soviets in the United States. Unless the Soviet Union allows more Americans to visit the Soviet Union, the United States should order all superfluous Soviets beyond the one hundred and sixty-eight to return home, he said.

### French Atomic Energy Commission Invents New Instrument for Detecting Uranium Ore

[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] The French Atomic Energy Commission announced on the 24th that while conducting research, they had invented a new instrument that can detect the presence of uranium ore underground.

When a small amount of uranium is brought close to the instrument, a sharp noise is emitted in the earphones, and the closer the distance, the louder the noise. It is said that uranium ore constantly emits a small amount of atomic energy before being refined, and the instrument emits noise when it receives atomic energy.

Sforza went on to say that he had received a telegram from the Soviet Union saying that the Soviet Union would approve the Treaty of Peace with Italy.

### Britain Agrees to Call Washington Conference to Discuss Increasing German Coal Production; Developments in the Conference Will Be Notified to France at Any Time

[This Newspaper] London, 25th Broadcast: Regarding the news from Washington that British Prime Minister Bevin will go to Washington in mid-August to discuss the issue of German industrial production with the United States, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office recently issued a statement saying that there are currently no plans regarding British Prime Minister Bevin's visit to the United States. It is understood that the United Kingdom, France and the United States will exchange views through diplomatic channels on the issue of German industry.

[Associated Press, London, 24th] Officials here said on the evening of the 24th that Britain had agreed in principle to discuss ways to increase coal production in the Ruhr area at the Washington conference. A British delegation of three or four people is scheduled to leave England next week. It is generally believed that British authorities intend to discuss the entire economic situation in the Ruhr area, including its financial revival, but the U.S. refuses to discuss economic issues at this time.

News from London: The agenda of the meeting will be flexible, and at the same time, many issues similar to the Ruhr coal area will inevitably be raised. France has not been invited to attend this meeting, because the meeting is mainly to discuss issues related to the U.S.-British merged zone in Germany. At the same time, senior British government officials said that the British government is drafting a plan to convene a tripartite conference (including France) to discuss German industrial standards. But this meeting must be postponed until the entire German economy is merged. According to this, the Anglo-American agreement on the provisions for German industrial production will be postponed until the current Paris conference completes the work of the Marshall Plan, but the British government has to consider two points: (1) The German economy must play a substantial role in European recovery. (2) Britain cannot hesitate any longer on German economic recovery, because at present Britain has to spend a lot of money in the British military zone in Germany. The economic recovery of the whole of Europe must include Germany, which is Britain's consistent policy.

[Reuters News Agency, Washington, 24th] After French Ambassador Bonnet exchanged general views with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Armor today, observers expect that the United Kingdom, the United States and France will be able to reach an agreement on a broad basis on the issue of German industry. Authorities said that the French ambassador's visit to Armor was a direct result of Secretary of State Marshall's assurance yesterday that the United Kingdom and the United States would not decide on a plan for German industrial standards before France had fully expressed its views. Also, a meeting on Ruhr coal production will be held in Washington soon. Although France will not participate, Marshall and Bevin have assured Bidault that France will be notified of the progress of the talks at any time.

### Peace Treaty Not Yet Concluded, Compensation Not Yet Determined; Shanghai Business Community Unanimously Advocates Delaying Discussion of Opening Trade with the Enemy, Japan; Avoid Repeating the Mistakes of Past Economic Aggression

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that the authorities in charge suspend consideration of "opening trade with Japan," stating that it was not yet the time to resume trade with Japan. The telegram stated: "Since the government authorities in charge have been proceeding with opening trade with Japan, the industrial circles in this city are extremely worried, fearing that after the opening, our fragile industry, which has not yet recovered, will inevitably suffer a major impact. This is the truth, and it is by no means alarmist. An examination of Japan's domestic industrial facilities reveals that the damage caused during the war is still evident, and the postwar recovery is also advancing rapidly. Although heavy industry is subject to control, light industry is generally free to develop. If it narrows its old advantages and makes a comeback, our country's fragile national industry will certainly not be its match. By the time the situation is irreversible and we want to impose control again, it may already be too late, and we will only have the feeling of regretting that we are wielding a weapon against ourselves. Therefore, for the sake of preserving the foundation of our country's industry, we should not lightly open trade with Japan, and even more so, we should use international laws to manage it. At present, the peace treaty with Japan has not yet been concluded, and the state of war does not seem to have completely disappeared. If we talk about trade with Japan at this time, it is not a normal move. Therefore, before the peace treaty with Japan is concluded, that is, before the international relations between China and Japan have been restored, it does not seem appropriate to rush into trade. Secondly, Japan has ravaged our country for eight years, and the public and private losses are incalculable. Now that the compensation issue has not been resolved, and we rashly restore trade relations, we will also be coldly criticized by those in the know. Therefore, from the perspective of general international practice, our country should not lightly talk about trade with Japan at this time, and even other countries that used to declare war on Japan should not consider this before international relations return to normal.

Absolutely Not Still Harboring Enmity and Deliberately Discriminating

Our Chinese nation has always taken peace and mutual assistance as its guiding principle in dealing with international relations. We originally agreed to be friendly and mutually beneficial with neighboring countries. What has been stated above is absolutely not still harboring enmity and deliberately discriminating. It is actually based on the standpoint of domestic national industry or international relations. If, after the peace treaty with Japan is concluded and international relations return to normal, we carefully study concrete measures within the scope of economic needs and possible mutual assistance between civil industries, it would be appropriate to restore normal trade between the two countries. If it is said that the government needs Japanese equipment and raw materials and cannot afford to delay, then the current Central Trust Bureau is already handling procurement, so there is no need to wait for the opening of trade with Japan. Rather than adding more problems by opening trade and then imposing control, it is better to maintain the status quo for the time being and wait until the peace treaty is concluded and compensation is resolved before considering it. In short, the opening of trade with Japan will have a huge impact, and we must carefully consider matters and plan thoroughly to avoid repeating the mistakes of being subjected to economic aggression before the war. It is reasonable to send a telegram to request inspection and to order the competent authorities to suspend consideration of opening trade with Japan in order to set things right."

### National Products Factories Federation Sends Telegram Requesting Cessation of Consideration

The Shanghai National Products Factories Federation also sent a telegram yesterday requesting the central government to stop considering opening trade with Japan. The original telegram stated: "In order to preserve a line of life for the affiliated associations to preserve national products, and in order to safeguard the lives of thousands of workers, we hereby earnestly appeal to your Excellency to examine and verify, and to firmly advocate stopping consideration of opening trade with Japan before the peace treaty with Japan has been signed and the compensation for damages has been agreed upon, and to suspend sending commercial representatives to Japan, in order to set national policy and emphasize sovereignty."

### Shanghai Branch of the Production Promotion Association Also Discusses Opposing the Opening

The Shanghai Branch of the China Production Promotion Association convened various industrial and commercial circles in the city in the conference room yesterday to discuss the issue of trade with Japan. As a result of the discussions, the following two points can be divided: (1) Oppose opening trade with Japan before the peace treaty is signed. (2) In order to adapt to the actual situation, it is intended to purely request the government to expand barter trade, so as to prevent the industrial and commercial circles of our country from heading towards extinction. At the same time, we will send telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to appeal for the cessation of consideration of opening up in order to protect our industry and commerce.

In addition, the National Shipping Federation and the Shanghai Shipping Commercial Guild will also convene a joint meeting of directors and supervisors this afternoon to seriously discuss this issue of trade with Japan.

### Japanese Are Skilled at Smuggling, and Future Leakage Will Be Huge; Hu Xiyuan of the Machinery Industry Association Expresses His Views

According to Hu Xiyuan, a standing director of the Machinery Industry Association, it is too early to open trade with Japan before the peace treaty is concluded and compensation is determined. Moreover, what our country needs, such as rayon, fertilizer powder, and various machines, are not ordinary commodities and are also on the list of imports. Although there are regulatory agencies engaged in regulation, the Japanese have unique skills in smuggling. Assuming that the import regulations are 90 million, and the facts of smuggling must be several times this amount, and our country exports 40 million yuan, because the official exchange rate is too different from the black market, it is feared that it will be difficult to reach this amount. Comparing the inflows and outflows, the leakage will be huge. Therefore, before trade with Japan is opened, we must conduct a detailed review of the technical issues to ensure that there are no regrets. At the same time, our industrial circles must, with the assistance of the government, open up avenues so that they can compete with Japanese goods in the Nanyang market. This point is as important as the intrusion of Japanese goods and cannot be ignored.

### Ten Thousand Yuan Army Appreciation Preparatory Committee Held Joint Meeting Yesterday; Mayor Wu Will Broadcast Tonight to Urge Citizens to Donate

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Valley Industry's Communist Suppression and National Construction Ten Thousand Yuan Army Appreciation Conference Preparatory Committee, along with the district chiefs and chairmen of district people's representative assemblies of each district, held a joint meeting at the Municipal Council Hall yesterday at 3:00 PM to discuss the issue of launching solicitations. Over eighty representatives from various units attended. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, giving a speech explaining that today's communist suppression is as important as the past eight years of resistance against Japan, hoping that Shanghai citizens will generously donate to strive for China's peaceful reunification. Committee Chairman Fang then reported on the preparation process for the army appreciation campaign. Speaker Pan reported on the organization of the solicitation committee, the organizational methods of the sub-committees in each district, the method of issuing army appreciation coupons, and the situation of supervision and printing, and also elaborated on the significance of the army appreciation campaign. Subsequently, Director of Civil Affairs Zhang Xiaosong reported on the points to note for solicitations in each district, and announced the following eight solicitation methods:

Eight Solicitation Methods

(1) Solicitation targets: Each district in the city will organize a solicitation sub-committee, with the chairman of the district people's representative assembly and the district chief serving as the chairman and vice-chairman respectively. City councilors, party representatives, and representatives from farmers, workers, and women's groups will all serve as solicitation committee members. (2) Solicitation time: From July 27th to August 4th for each district in the urban area, and from July 27th to August 7th for each district in the suburban area. (3) Army appreciation coupons are divided into five denominations: 1 million yuan, 500,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan, totaling 12.8 billion yuan. The quota for each district will be specified in a separate table. (4) Solicitation should be conducted on the principle of voluntary participation, without using apportionment methods. It is hoped that each household will donate at least 10,000 yuan, and will generously donate according to the principle of "those who have money contribute money." Poor households will be exempt from solicitation. After each household has paid the donation, they should immediately exchange it for army appreciation coupons on the spot, and it is best to paste them on the door to identify them. (5) After the army appreciation coupons are stamped, they will all be sent to the city bank representative for issuance. The city bank will distribute them to the chairmen and vice-chairmen of each solicitation sub-committee according to the quota of each district. The sub-committees in each district should deposit the collected funds into the city bank's account #2324 in a timely manner. If there is no city bank organization nearby, it can be handed over to other banks for collection, but all army appreciation coupon stubs with district distinctions and all donations must be handed over to the city bank for accounting by the deadline, and all accounts must be settled before August 8th. (6) Individuals and groups who donate freely are requested to directly pay to the city bank or the district office's account #2324 and receive army appreciation coupons. Those who have already sent them to the municipal government or the municipal party headquarters will be forwarded to the city bank by the municipal government and party headquarters for issuing army appreciation coupons. (7) In order to prevent army appreciation coupons from circulating in the market, regardless of whether each household or individual pastes the army appreciation coupons or not, the solicitor must mark "Donated" on the coupon face on the spot. (8) These methods will be implemented after being approved by the conference. Then, Xie Chouji, director of the municipal party headquarters, supplemented the report on the various procedures of the conference's army appreciation coupon printing, supervision and printing, custody, issuance, solicitation, cancellation, and future distribution.

In addition, the propaganda department of the ten thousand yuan army appreciation conference preparation committee, in order to closely cooperate, decided to start broadcasting propaganda, and will ask leaders from all circles and representatives from all walks of life to broadcast on Shanghai Radio every day, so as to stimulate the enthusiasm of citizens to donate money to appreciate the army. It is reported that Mayor Wu has been scheduled to broadcast first tonight from 8:00 PM to 8:15 PM.

### Labor-Management Adjudication Committee Meeting Will Discuss Dismissal Methods

[Our Newspaper] The Labor-Management Adjudication Committee is scheduled to convene its 12th meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM this afternoon, with more than ten motions awaiting discussion. Among them, the dismissal method is the most important, and a debate is expected. According to sources, the dismissal method researched and submitted for discussion by the subcommittee stipulates that factory workers who violate factory rules can be dismissed by the factory first, and then reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. If dismissed for other reasons, the bureau should be notified for approval first. For companies and shops that dismiss employees, since there are too many shops in the city, it is not necessary to report to the bureau for record or approval, but rather the labor and management should negotiate on their own. If the negotiation fails, the Social Affairs Bureau should be requested for resolution.

After the director agreed, the families of the traitors raised five to six million yuan and asked Xiao Jianqing, the editor-in-chief of the puppet Youth Pictorial and a "painter," to design the framework. Li Zulai, the "deputy manager of the business department of the puppet Bank of China," volunteered and rolled up his sleeves, acting as a carpenter and building the shed, with surprisingly "proficient skills."

Seeing Director Shan, he led reporters to inspect the back garden. Corn, tomatoes, grapes, and cabbages were all available. The past "high officials and noble people" are now carrying water and planting vegetables. It is said that everyone is happily competing to do it. In a corner of the garden, there are about two hundred chickens and ducks, and four large white pigs, with the "painter" Xiao Jianqing acting as the shepherd. Turning around, we saw several people sitting bare-chested next to the vegetable garden. Seeing us coming, they quickly put on their shirts and stood up. Oh!

### Assassination of Qiu Lianhuan Case; Fourteen Suspects Indicted; Zhu Liansheng Unaware, Exempted from Discussion; Feng Renyi, etc. to be Handled Separately After Arrest

The Indictment Details the Murder Process Vividly

[Our Newspaper] The case of Qiu Lianhuan, the inspector of the Gao Shiman Dance Hall, being assassinated in front of the Atlantic Western Restaurant, has been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Xu Ding of the District Prosecutor's Office after the suspects were sent to the prosecutor's office. According to the severity of the crimes, indictments and non-indictments were issued separately. Nine people, including Sheng Shugen, a jobless hooligan, Wei Xiaoyang, Ye Dongying, inspectors of Nanshi Theater, Li Desheng, a vendor, Chu Shutang, a coppersmith, Ye Liangjiang, a used clothing dealer, Mao Chenyun, a vendor, and Xiang Yinquan, a rickshaw puller, committed murder together and will be charged under Article 28 and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Four accomplices, including Ma Caide (aka Agou), a plasterer, Ma Wenkui (aka Sanba), a painter, Chuan Qifu, and Chen Fugen (aka Xiaodier), a coppersmith, will be charged under Article 30 and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Chen Yonggui, who harbored the criminals, will be charged under Article 164, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The public prosecutor has filed a public prosecution against the above fourteen suspects in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. As for Zhu Yunsheng's permission for Sheng Shugen to stay overnight, it was at Chen Yonggui's request, and Zhuan Yi was also unaware of the situation. The evidence of the crime is insufficient and will be exempted from discussion. Although Zhang Ruting is a jobless hooligan and has a long criminal record of theft, he was mistakenly implicated and will be dealt with separately without indictment. The fugitives, Feng Renyi, Bai Laili, Ajingen, Wang Aqiao, Yu Caigen, Shi Guoguang, Zhou Fuqing, and Li Bin, will be handled separately after being arrested. The case

Facts of the Case

According to the indictment, the victim, Qiu Lianhuan, had no permanent job and was idle. Later, he was employed as a dispatch member of the Central Bureau of Statistics and as an inspector of the Gao Shiman Dance Hall, and his influence became even greater. He usually relied on his strength to bully others, and many people resented him, resulting in numerous grievances. Especially with Sheng Shugen, Fu Qifu, and the fugitives Feng Renyi, Bai Laili, etc., the resentment was the deepest, and they had long harbored the intention of harming him. On May 30th of this year, Feng Renyi and Bai Laili separately summoned their followers, Mao Qingyun, Ajingen, Wang Aqiao, Yu Caigen, Wang Agou, Shi Guoguang, Zhou Fuqing, and other seven people, to room 16 of the Zhonghua Xin Hotel on Beijing Road to discuss the matter of harming Qiu Lianhuan. They also invited Sheng Shugen to join in advance. Sheng, considering his weakness, feared that he would not be up to the task. They further invited Ye Dongying, nicknamed "Southern Hercules," and Wei Xiaoyang, nicknamed "Eastern Hercules," as well as Rong Liangjiang, Chu Shurong, and many others whose names are unknown, to jointly implement the plan. That evening, Feng Renyi and others

Each Carried a Sharp Blade

From the Zhonghua Xin Hotel to the Gao Shiman Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road. Sheng Shugen and others also arrived at the dance hall by a roundabout route, all scattering and lingering at the entrance, intending to ambush Qiu outside and then jointly harm him. However, Qiu had already left earlier that night, so they missed him and returned without success. The next day, Bai Laili again invited his follower Xiang Yinquan to join, tempting him with rewards. Xiang gladly accepted the order and immediately went to the Zhonghua Xin Hotel to discuss the matter. After dinner, they purchased two more sharp knives for use and were still led by Feng Renyi and Bai Laili. The group arrived in front of the Central Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road around 10:00 PM to ambush Qiu. Sheng Shugen and others also arrived as scheduled and scattered along the road.

A Sudden Downpour

Around 10:30 PM, Qiu hurriedly walked out of the Atlantic Restaurant. Because he was walking very fast, they couldn't catch up. The plan again failed. All of them returned disappointed, and rescheduled for the next day to reconvene at the original location and seize the opportunity to implement the plan. The next day, June 1st, Sheng Shugen and others were very angry at the repeated failures. That afternoon, around 2:00 PM, Wei Xiaoyang invited Li Desheng and Li Bin, and Feng Renyi invited Bao Yongfa, Chen Fugen, Ma Caide, Ma Wenkui, etc. to assist, and several others whose names are unknown, first at the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall. Chen Fugen and Ma Wenkui ambushed at the Jincheng Navigation Agency, and used the telephone to coordinate temporarily. Around 8:00 PM that evening, Sheng Shugen and others went to Fuxing Garden for dinner, and then went to the front of the Atlantic Restaurant,

Scattering and Standing

Feng Bai also led Mao Xiang and the fugitives Li Bin, Chen Jingen, Wang Agou, Wang Aqiao, etc. to go by car. Around 11:00 PM, they estimated that Qiu Lianhuan would come out of the Atlantic Restaurant at this time. Ma Caide, Chen Fugen, Ma Wenkui, etc. notified the unknown persons in the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall by telephone. They gathered at once and agreed to have Feng Renyi and Sheng Shugen shout Qiu Lianhuan's name as a signal. A little later, Qiu did come out of the Atlantic at a slow pace, and Sheng immediately called out Qiu's name. Qiu heard the call and stepped back, looking back. Sheng immediately stepped forward and pulled out

A Concealed Sharp Blade

He fiercely slashed Qiu's right arm and other parts. Hua Yixun immediately hugged Qiu tightly and did not let go. Xiang, Li, Sheng, Mao, Chu, Chai, and other five or six people stepped forward and used their prepared knives and sticks to slash and beat Qiu. Qiu, in addition to being injured, struggled with his right hand and fired the prepared handgun to the left and right. Xiang Yinquan should have been hit in the waist, and Mao and the fugitive Yang Nannan helped him hire a rickshaw to send him to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. The rest of the crowd saw that the purpose had been achieved, and were startled by the gunfire. They all dispersed in a hubbub. A patrolling police officer discovered this and sent Qiu by car to Renji Hospital. He died of his injuries at 4:00 AM on the second day of the Western calendar. Mao Qingyun went to Xiang's house to inquire about the situation after the incident, and was captured by the police. Yang then

Escaped in the Meantime

Without a trace. Around 7:00 AM on the same morning, Sheng Shugen started from Chen Yonggui's house and was accompanied by Chen to Zhu Liansheng's house in Longhua to take refuge temporarily. The police bureau learned of this, and on the evening of the fourth day, Chen Yonggui and Sheng Shugen were arrested in succession. On the afternoon of the fifth day, the Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters arrested Li Desheng, Wei Xiaoyang, Ma Wenkui, and Ye Dongying's concubine Wang Aixiang, and handed them over to the police bureau. After Ye received the news, he turned himself in to the police bureau the next day and confessed the previous situation without concealment. He released Aixiang and led the arrest of Chai Liangjiang and Chu Shutang. At midnight on the eighth, Wei Xiaoyang's apprentice Zhang Ruting was also arrested. At 10:00 AM on the ninth, Ma Wenkui turned himself in to the police bureau. At 10:00 PM on the same afternoon, Chen Fugen was arrested again. At 11:00 AM on the twelfth, Chuan Qifu, who was arrested by the Coast Guard Group of the Port Affairs Committee, was sent to the police bureau. The police bureau sent all the above-mentioned criminals to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Four People Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Selling UNRRA Flour

[Our Newspaper] Flour from the UNRRA Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office was flowing into the black market in large quantities. After Deputy Inspector Czech Stroujie discovered this, he reported the suspects who stole and sold the flour, Lu Qibin, Liu Zhengxiang, Liu Baoyong, and Chen Yangzhou, to the police bureau for questioning. They were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday. The flour issued by the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office to the Tianyi Engineering Company, which contracted the project, was received by Lu Qibin. Through the hands of grain runner Liu Bao, it was sold to flour merchant Liu Zhengqun in the market. Around 3:00 PM on the 21st, 100 bags of flour printed with "UNRRA Relief Flour" were being loaded onto trucks at the entrance of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouse when Inspector Ji Gang of the office happened to see them. He stepped forward to inquire, and Liu Zhengxiang replied that he had purchased them for 228,000 yuan per bag. Ji believed that this flour should not be bought and sold privately, and reported it to Stroujie, who took Liu Zhengxiang and others to the Beizhan Police Sub-Bureau for questioning. According to Lu Qibin's confession at the police bureau, the flour had been sold eight or nine times. Because the flour was intended for the workers to eat, a portion of the surplus flour was sold to pay the workers' wages. Moreover, when Tianyi Engineering Company signed the contract with the Seawall Engineering Office in the past, it did not state that resale was prohibited. Liu Baoyong confessed that he sold a total of more than 4,000 bags of flour on behalf of Tianyi Engineering Company. On the 17th of this month, he sold 150 bags, with Dacheng, Senji, and Tongmao Flour Shops each buying 50 bags.

[Report from our newspaper] The city's budget for income and expenditure, as well as general financial issues, have yielded considerable results since Director Tian went to Nanjing to negotiate.

### Hailu Steamer Aground Near Qixia Mountain

[Report from our newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hailu steamer, which had been carrying 2,300 tons of edible salt from Tianjin, was heading up the Yangtze River on the 23rd of this month to deliver its full cargo. Yesterday, the bureau received a telegram stating that at 7:30 AM yesterday, while sailing to a river section near Qixia Mountain, 15 nautical miles from Nanjing, it suddenly ran aground. As there was no detailed report, the cause of the grounding was not included. According to those familiar with the matter, the area is a sandbar and there is no danger, and there is no need to send a tugboat. The ship should be able to get out of danger when the tide rises. The shipping office has already telegraphed the ship to investigate the details.

### The Unfortunate Hai Zhe Steamer; Still Aground After Hitting Rocks; Steward Commits Suicide

[Report from our newspaper] The Hai Zhe steamer, which ran aground on rocks in Axe Bay between Xiamen and Kinmen Island's Huading Island, was originally transporting glass sand to Qinhuangdao. The cargo is now being transshipped to Xiamen and will then be transported to Qinhuangdao on the Hai Dian steamer. Although the ship ran aground in shallow water and there is no danger of sinking, it is very difficult to get out of danger. The Maritime Transport Administration attaches great importance to the grounding of the Hai Zhe steamer. Yesterday, they dispatched a wound specialist by plane to Xiamen and then to the output office to inspect the situation and assist in the rescue. Wang Huantang, a steward on the Hai Zhe, committed suicide on the 23rd (the day after the ship ran aground). According to the captain's report, the steward had been behaving abnormally recently and had been repeatedly advised by colleagues to no avail. Suddenly, at about 7 AM on the 23rd, he locked his room door from the inside. He was discovered and rescued, but it was too late, and he died. The body is now in a coffin on Kinmen Island. The Shanghai liaison office is the Jinfeng Water and Electricity Village Material Store at No. 1260 Gordon Road, Xin Zha Road. The bureau has sent someone to notify them after receiving the telegram.

### Four Blind Men Involved in a Lawsuit; Feeling Their Way to Court

[Not a report from our newspaper] Yesterday morning, there were four blind men involved in a lawsuit in the court. For a time, they were feeling around for ropes in the courtroom, which even caused the dignified judge to be unable to help but smile. The Shanghai Astrologers Mutual Aid Association was established to strengthen the mutual assistance of astrologers. The founders all worked hard to promote it everywhere. In May of this year, the plaintiffs Xue Yongming and Lou Dezhong, together with Yu Zhongxiang, the standing director of the association, went to No. 117 Dantu Road, Hongkou, to persuade fellow practitioners to join. They met the two defendants, Qian Zhongyang and Qian Shanhua. When the plaintiffs tried to persuade them to join, they not only ignored them but also hurled abuse at them. Neither side would give in. Qian Zhonghua even rushed out of the door, grabbed the two plaintiffs, and took out a small knife to stab Xue's left forehead and eyebrow. The police station then transferred the case to the court for trial. When the defendants were questioned in court, they cried out that they had been wronged, stating that the two plaintiffs had come to extort 60,000 yuan for membership fees, which led to the quarrel, and that there had been no stabbing. The court found that each side had its own version of events and needed further investigation, so the hearing was postponed.

Unless the Communist bandits are eliminated, there is no hope for peaceful and prosperous life.

### The Right to Approve or Reject Deferment or Exemption from Military Service is Absolutely Not Something that the Baojia Heads, Etc., Can Control

Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, further clarified the following regarding the most common misunderstandings and abuses in the procedures for able-bodied men applying for deferment or exemption from military service:

It is reported that when able-bodied men in various districts submit their applications to the offices of the Baojia heads, the Baojia heads and Bao cadres, because the Baojia head must affix his seal on the application form, some Baojia heads, out of consideration for relationships, affix their seals without verifying the facts, while other Baojia heads deliberately make things difficult and refuse to affix their seals, creating the impression that the Baojia heads and Bao cadres have the power to approve or reject deferment or exemption from military service for able-bodied men. As a result, able-bodied men engage in scheming and bribery is rampant. In fact, the Baojia head is only responsible for providing truthful certification on the application form and has no power to approve or reject it. The application for deferment or exemption from military service for able-bodied men, after being sealed by the Baojia head for certification, is sent to the district office, which conducts a factual review. The district office then sends it to the municipal government, which, together with the Municipal Military Service Association, organizes a review committee for the final review. After the municipal review committee reviews and confirms that the applicant meets the conditions for deferment or exemption from military service, it is then sent to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters to issue the deferment or exemption certificate. Only then is the application review procedure completed. Therefore, the issuance of deferment and exemption certificates is the prerogative of the Garrison Headquarters, and the responsibility for reviewing and approving deferment applications lies with the Shanghai Review Committee. It is absolutely not something that the Baojia heads and Bao cadres can manipulate or influence, or have the power to approve or reject.

### The Fixed National Textbook Does Not Conform to the Democratic Trend; Suggestion to Propose Discussion at the Basic Education Conference

[Da Hua News Agency] The fixed national textbook system should be abolished entirely. The National Political Council and the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association have repeatedly made resolutions on this matter in the past. The Basic Education Research Association, recently formed by several experts in the education and culture circles of this city, has been holding meetings to discuss this issue. They all believe that the fixed national textbook system is a legacy of the Anti-Japanese War, and this phenomenon does not conform to the trend of the times and is not found in any democratic country. It should be abolished as soon as possible. Moreover, the content of this textbook is of poor quality. Despite repeated revisions, it is still full of errors. The curriculum standards on which it is based are temporary regulations promulgated during the Anti-Japanese War, and its framework is outdated. It cannot be remedied by mere revision and patching. Therefore, it is advocated to collect various opinions, prepare a memorandum, and suggest to the United Nations Far East Basic Education Conference to be held in China in September that this matter be seriously discussed.

### The Textile Adjustment Committee Held a Discussion Meeting Yesterday; Cotton Cloth Price Negotiation to Be Delayed

Cloth prices will be discussed after cotton prices are determined.

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened an informal discussion meeting at its offices yesterday afternoon around 4 p.m. to discuss the issue of cotton cloth price negotiation. Representatives from China Textile Construction Company, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office attended, including Liu Siying, Wang Qiyu, Gao Bingtai, Pan Shihao, Dong Jiufeng, and Ouyang Lun, totaling more than ten people. The meeting was chaired by Liu Siying and adjourned around 6 p.m.

The result of the exchange of views yesterday was that there are currently many types of cotton cloth with complex patterns, and sufficient consideration should be given before price negotiation. If prices are hastily agreed upon, difficulties may be encountered during implementation. Furthermore, cotton cloth price negotiation needs to be coordinated with cotton yarn price negotiation, so it is better to wait until cotton prices are confirmed before discussing cotton cloth prices. In the future, when discussing cotton cloth prices, several standard fabrics will be selected for preliminary price negotiation, so that other types of fabrics can be proportionally assessed and priced. Finally, the dyeing industry representatives expressed the current situation where the cotton yarn supply cannot be coordinated with the dyeing and weaving industry's needs. The Textile Adjustment Committee will instruct the industry to first collect detailed data for the committee's reference, in order to adjust the yarn allocation amount.

Nine Replicated Industries Provide Opinions

[Another Dispatch] It is reported that the current cotton cloth price negotiation was originally prompted by the Municipal Government Economic Conference. Recently, the city's situation has been stable, and specifying price negotiation may cause a reverse stimulus. Two days before the meeting, the dyeing and weaving industry representatives discussed this with Director Liu, so yesterday's meeting shifted its focus to the principle of yarn and cloth adjustment.

Mr. Pan Shihao, in his capacity as the person in charge of the replicated industries, presented production equipment figures for nine manufacturing industries, including dyeing and weaving, knitting, handkerchiefs, towels, blankets, underwear, handmade cotton fabrics, camel hair, sails, and ribbons, explaining the cotton yarn shortage. He also severely criticized the seriousness of the fact that small factories have always been excluded from yarn allocation. Director Liu and Director Ouyang of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office attached great importance to this, and personally instructed Mr. Pan to provide written supplements for a more effective remedy.

Mr. Liu also repeatedly stated that the industry associations must provide accurate statistics for reference in yarn allocation and contract weaving. According to Mr. Pan, a meeting of the nine replicated industries will be convened in the coming days to coordinate with the textile adjustment policy.

A Glimpse of the Situation of Cotton Cloth Allocation

[Reported by This Newspaper] A person in charge of China Textile Construction Company, in view of the company's cotton cloth allocation, made the following remarks:

(1) The outside world attributes the previous cotton cloth price increase to the company's insufficient supply. In fact, the company has always maintained a sufficient allocation volume. In June, it allocated a total of 1,117,113 bolts, with 887,113 bolts sold at the door. However, the total cloth production of the company's Shanghai factories in that month was only 652,205 bolts, which was less than the amount sold at the door in the city. The shortfall was supplied by the company's factories in other cities.

(2) The outside world criticizes the company for unbalanced cloth allocation, but the company's allocation is based on the company's production situation. In general, cloth merchants increase their allocation requests when cloth prices rise, and decrease their allocation requests when cloth prices fall. Therefore, rather than saying that the supply is unbalanced, it is better to say that the demand is unbalanced.

(3) The outside world has requested that the company announce the allocation volume in advance before each allocation. In fact, the company's allocation purpose is to stabilize cotton cloth market prices. If business secrets are announced in advance, it would be easily manipulated and controlled by others, which would not be beneficial.

### Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company: The First Phase of the Plan Has Been Completed

In the past, a large number of Chinese silk fabrics were sold to India and Southeast Asia. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the unstable Chinese economy and rising costs, the overseas market price was lower than the cost. In order to promote the export of Chinese silk fabrics, resolve the serious crisis in the silk weaving industry, and increase the country's foreign exchange income, the Shanghai silk weaving industry negotiated with the Central Bank to establish the Silk Fabric Guidance Committee, which was approved by the Executive Yuan. The committee provided the necessary raw materials and all processing fees. On the one hand, the industry organized the Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Venture Company, which strictly managed the first phase of contract weaving totaling 110,000 bolts. The company entrusted the weaving to 203 manufacturers in the same industry, activating 2,072 looms, starting weaving in mid-March. Since May, most of the fabrics have been sold overseas, and the rest will be completely woven by the end of this month. Overseas silk merchants are very satisfied with the neat and beautiful products. Orders have been received from India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf. The selling price has also been improving daily. After the first phase of silk fabric is sold, more than 20 million rupees in foreign exchange can be obtained. Currently, the chairman of the company, Luo Qinghua, is in Beijing reporting the progress to the relevant agencies. President Zhang of the Executive Yuan, Vice President Wang, and members of the National Economic Commission, Chen Lifu, and both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have expressed their satisfaction. They believe that it is in line with the "industry joint venture" and "ordering system" methods in the economic reform plan. Other industries can follow suit and implement it. The company's second phase of production and sales plan was submitted to the Guidance Committee at the beginning of the month. It is reported that President Zhang and Vice President Liu of the Central Bank, and Director Wu Rencang of the China Trust Bureau attach great importance to this. They are discussing it in detail with the Guidance Committee and American consultants. It can be approved in the coming days, and contracts can be signed and materials can be issued, so that the company can continue production and tens of thousands of technicians will not face unemployment due to work stoppages.

### Rumors of Favorable Buying Abound: Chinese Stocks Launch a Wave of Increases; As Many As Sixteen Types Reach the Limit

After a continuous decline in Chinese stocks, they suddenly rebounded yesterday after being sluggish. The Cantonese and Ningbo financial groups jointly absorbed shares, and shorts in the industry rushed to cover their positions. Foreign stocks received special stimulation and jumped sharply first. As a result, rumors of favorable buying abounded, and as many as sixteen types of stocks, both hot and cold, hit their price limits. After Yongsha hit its price limit, the asking price on the black market continued to rise by about half a percent. The gloomy atmosphere of the past few days was swept away at this point, and a vibrant atmosphere was seen. The short side has already been shaken, and large investors have switched from selling to buying, and the trend is expected to improve further.

Early in the morning, due to the loose money supply, buyers were reluctant to buy. When the market opened steadily, Yongsha, No. 91, and No. 231 increased to 195 yuan. No. 223, No. 142, No. 11, No. 110, No. 97, No. 163, No. 14, and No. 83 were mainly selling, with No. 152 selling the most. Yongsha once fell to a low of 180 yuan, and the immediate transaction Yongsha only reached a low price of 182 yuan. Meiya was closed by No. 188, No. 60, No. 237, No. 156, No. 223, No. 157, and No. 133. The forward transaction fell to 415 yuan, and the immediate transaction fell to 404 yuan. Xinyi, Xinguang, and Jingfu had fewer transactions, and it was difficult to avoid the same decline at this time. Later, after No. 77, No. 104, No. 97, No. 231, and No. 12 bought in, Yongsha rose to 188 yuan. No. 152 still insisted on selling, and No. 207 also supplied spot Bing Sha. At this time, it was still sluggish. No. 130 in the money exchange industry continued to buy spot Yongsha. No. 102, No. 133, No. 160, No. 91, and No. 106 bought in again, and the forward Yongsha rose back to 191 yuan. At this time, because No. 186 supplied spot Bing Sha, Xinyi, Xinguang, and Jingfu, it still did not escape the consolidation.

When No. 162 from the Cantonese financial group entered the market to buy, the situation began to change. The shorts in Laizhong, such as No. 223, No. 224, No. 231, and No. 89, continued to cover their positions. No. 156, No. 112, No. 69, No. 183, and No. 14 also increased their purchases. At 10:30, Commercial Press first rose to the price limit, and the forward cotton yarn rose to 209 yuan. No. 173 and No. 169 closed their positions at a high price and struggled. No. 232, No. 160, No. 142, No. 137, No. 129, No. 157, No. 36, and No. 117 suddenly bought in aggressively, and Matches then rose to the price limit from No. 22. As a result, Yongsha spot and forward also rose to the price limit. After the situation changed, rumors of buying assistance abounded, and more stocks were covered. Bing Sha carried out spot-priced black market transactions. The remaining stocks, such as Qinxing by No. 42, Zhongfa by No. 168! Yonggong by No. 42, Xinyi immediate transaction by No. 152 and No. 84 and No. 223, forward transaction by No. 219 and No. 163, Jingfu by No. 56, Zhongfang by No. 149, Rongfeng by No. 104 and No. 83, Xinya by No. 141 (no transaction), and Qinhua by No. 141, jointly announced that they had reached the limit. The entire market rose across the board. Forward Yongsha was purchased by No. 223, No. 224, etc. to 230 yuan.

Around 12 o'clock, No. 235, No. 14, and No. 102 once sold to the price limit, but No. 76, No. 27, No. 94, and No. 55 still bought in, and No. 232 and No. 156 bought in spot Yongsha again. With the signing of the Sino-British trade agreement, foreign stock Yisha became even more , and people's hearts became more invigorated. Finally, the forward Bing Sha was called up to 233 yuan, the spot Yongsha was 227 yuan, and Xinyi, Xinguang, Zhongsi, and Qinxing reached the price limit again.

As a result, compared to the previous close, the immediate transaction stocks Bing Sha, Rongfeng, Xinyi, Zhongsi, Commercial Press, Matches, Xinguang, Shuigong, Jingfu, Qinxing, Zhongfa, and New Drug all rose to the price limit. Meiya, Underwear, Tongyi, and Zhongfang rose to the price limit and then fell back, but still rose strongly by 10%. Datong, Guohuo, and Xinya each rose strongly by 50%, Huafeng rose by weakly by 20%, and Jinglun, Wuhe, Lianan, and Cement each rose strongly by 10%. In the forward transaction, Meiya rose by more than 10%, and Huagang rose to the price limit and then fell back, rising by 150%. Bing Sha, Xinyi, Xinguang, Yonggong, Jing and Qinxing all rose to the price limit. Each old stock outside the market rose slightly, ranging from to 10% weakly, and was also very popular.

### National Banks and Bureaus Sold Off a Large Amount Yesterday

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yesterday, national banks and bureaus sold off a large amount, reaching 65.5 billion yuan. It is reported that the Central Bank sold off more than 41 billion yuan alone. The market money supply has become increasingly loose, and black market interest rates range from 1.2 cents to 5 cents. The main reason for the large sale by national banks and bureaus is that funds that flowed south previously have now returned in large quantities.

### Last Year's Tea Loan Mortgage Boxed Tea to Still be Purchased According to Original Method

Regarding the boxed tea mortgaged by the Farmers Bank last year, the Four-Bank Joint Office, in order to alleviate the difficulties of tea merchants, made a special purchase and repeatedly extended the application deadline. The final extension of five days expired yesterday (25th). Although representatives of the tea merchants went to Beijing again to request an increase in the purchase price, the result remained the same as originally agreed, and the boxed tea purchase problem was resolved.

The tea merchants have also agreed to abide by the originally approved price and complete the purchase procedures before (25th). If the tea merchants do not apply by (25th), the Central Trust Bureau will not extend the deadline. The Farmers Bank will also not make concessions for the expired boxed tea. If they do not prepare funds to redeem the application for purchase, they will fulfill the contract and handle their collateral, which will still be handed over to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase.

It is reported that the tea merchants have fully redeemed the Tunlu tea mortgaged to the Farmers Bank and sold it to French merchants. The types that cannot be exported are Qihong and Pinglu. Among those that have not yet been redeemed, there are 15,000 boxes of Qihong and approximately 40,000 boxes of Pinglu, with a mortgage amount of nearly 10 billion yuan. Only a few have not yet expired. For those that have expired, the Farmers Bank has begun to handle their collateral. The boxed tea purchase, which has been brewing for more than a year, has come to an end.

Tea Merchants Request Purchase of Stale Tea

[Our Newspaper] The deadline for applying to the Central Trust Bureau to purchase stale tea from 1946 was yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, more than 20 tea merchants jointly submitted a letter to the bureau, requesting that it quickly purchase the stale tea from last year that is stored in the hands of various tea merchants.

Export Trade in Tea is Scarce in Both Supply and Demand

Another report: Ever since the French Yongxing Foreign Firm indicated that the required amount of 900 tons of Chun Mee green tea, which it recently planned to promote for sale in Morocco, Africa, was gradually being met, its current activity has become somewhat relaxed. However, those holding the goods are still concerned due to the thin market inventory. Therefore, the trend continues to show a picture of scarcity in both supply and demand, with transactions as rare as morning stars, and the market atmosphere remains strong. Other low-end stale black teas are still in demand from exporters, and the process is not declining. Various domestic teas, during this hot summer, are still being removed by the shops and merchant groups in this district, and this continues to increase, with the Anhui baked green tea from this year seeing particularly active sales, continuing to improve daily.

### Unified Bonds Advance, Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise

Government bonds continued to advance yesterday, with people still holding onto illusions. Transaction volume increased to more than 3 million. Unified Series C opened at 8,800 yuan. Rooms 538 and 503 advanced, rising to 9,800 yuan. Rooms 555 and 230 closed out at the higher prices, retreating slightly at the close. As a result, Series A, B, and C each rose by 800 yuan compared to the previous close, Series D rose by 700 yuan, and Series E rose by a good 900 yuan.

Shares in the Yi Sha company rose the most yesterday, due to external stimulus, coupled with rumors of the signing of a Sino-British commercial treaty. Rubber shares were also carried along. Yi Sha opened at 71,000 yuan, with demand exceeding supply. With limited chips, the price rose to a high of 84,000 yuan before turning sideways. As a result, Yi Sha, Yi Beer, and Paper each rose by half, Jardine Matheson also rose by 10%, and the remaining shares all rose by half a percent.

### Bankers Association to Hold General Meeting Today

[Our Newspaper] The 14th General Meeting of the Bankers and Commercial Association of this city is scheduled to be held today at 2 PM at the City Chamber of Commerce. More than ten proposals from various members have been sorted out in advance by the association's board of directors and supervisors and will be submitted for discussion at today's meeting. The revision of industry regulations will also be discussed.

### National Cement Industry Association Requests Expansion of Gunny Sack Quota and Requests Continued Suspension of Foreign Cement Imports

[Our Newspaper] The National Cement Industry Association recently sent a telegram requesting an expansion of the third-quarter gunny sack quota. The main points are: gunny sacks are the main material for packaging cement. If all cement factories in the country fully exert their production capacity, they will need 7 million 100-kg gunny sacks per month. Other industries also have many needs. The association previously set the second-quarter import quota at US$850,000, which can only import about 1.5 million gunny sacks, which is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Therefore, it submitted separate reports to relevant agencies, requesting that the gunny sack import quota be relaxed, but the result was not approved. Now, as the third-quarter import quota is about to be approved and announced, the association believes that cement production is important, and packaging materials are indispensable. Therefore, it recently sent telegrams to the National Economic Commission and the Provisional Management Committee, requesting that the gunny sack quota be expanded as much as possible to maintain the industry. As for the second-quarter gunny sack quota, the cement industry accounted for 49.25%, and the quota allocation office has already allocated it according to the consumption of cement factories nationwide. However, because importers are very slow to obtain export licenses from India, they have not yet been able to apply for orders. The association members are very much in need of the sacks and expressed regret about this.

The association also sent a telegram to the authorities, requesting that the import of foreign cement be prohibited. Last year, China's cement industry was threatened by the dumping of foreign goods in China. Fortunately, the authorities saw the difficulties and dangers and stopped the supply of foreign exchange for ordering, completely stopping the import quota for the first and second quarters of this year, which was of great benefit. Now, as the third-quarter quota is about to be promulgated, and various factories have been actively increasing production in recent months, in addition to meeting the needs of all parties, there is already a surplus. Therefore, it sent a telegram to the National Economic Commission and the Import Management Committee, requesting that the cement import quota be stopped to help the domestic cement industry.

Claiming Reparations from Japan - Cement Factories

In addition, the association's claim for reparations from Japan for cement factories will soon be submitted for negotiation. During the Anti-Japanese War, China's cement industry was ravaged by the Japanese for eight years. Some were completely looted, some were severely bombed, and some were forcibly occupied and used, resulting in complete disfigurement. The severity of the damage is rarely matched in the domestic industrial sector. The association previously dispatched Chen Hanqing, Xi Zhengxiu, and others to Beijing to petition the Compensation Committee, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that Japanese cement factories be dismantled and compensated to China. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Compensation Committee's subcommittees have both approved the proposal. Once it is submitted to the plenary session for a resolution, it can be formally submitted to the Far East Commission. However, it is heard that the Japanese side claims that most of the Japanese cement factories have been converted into other factories, so there is no value in dismantling them. It is found that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has a technical team for dismantling and relocating Japanese factories, which will go to Japan to work soon. The association will request permission to recommend a cement expert to participate, so that the investigation of Japanese cement factories can be more detailed.

### Yarn Prices Rise Slightly, Cotton Cloth Buying Interest Increases

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation, at the opening, because the Textile and Construction Company opened yarn as usual, prices were once again suppressed. 42-count Sunlight yarn was listed as low as 16.1 million yuan, and people's hearts suddenly became weak. Soon, because the market's funds became more abundant, and it had been falling for several days in a row, yarn factories refused to sell easily due to insufficient costs. Some merchant groups and industry peers had some demand at low prices, and the market showed slight progress.

In the end, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn rose back to 17 million yuan, an increase of 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse yarn was 11.8 million yuan, and Double Horse yarn was 10.05 million yuan, both rising 450,000 to 600,000 yuan. The remaining coarse and fine yarns such as 16-count, 20-count, and 32-count also uniformly rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan, respectively.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation, the market was still weak at the opening, and selling within the market was not uncommon. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth once fell to 400,600 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, people in the industry, seeing that yarn prices had risen, funds had loosened, and interest in buying had strengthened, and large outside traders had once again competitively bought at low prices, and small traders stopped selling and turned to buying, the buying interest in the market suddenly became very strong. Chips became increasingly scarce.

In the end, Longtou fine cloth rose back to 426,000 yuan, an increase of 7,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloths of various grades such as Wufu, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and Blue Chicken also rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. Bleached cloth and Serge, which sold well, rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. The various cloths of this factory had sluggish actual sales and were trending downstream, but blue cloth and Shilin cloth remained largely unchanged.

Textile and Construction Company Distributes Yarn

[Our Newspaper] The China Textile and Construction Company yesterday distributed yarn jointly with the Textile Adjustment Association as usual, distributing a total of 778 pieces, all to manufacturers. There were a total of 267 purchase applications.

Spot Cotton Turns Strong

Yesterday, spot cotton prices improved due to the stabilization and rebound of cotton yarn prices, and market sentiment was boosted again. Buying interest in the market was strong, and as a result, prices of various grades rose slightly compared to the previous day.

### Artificial Silk Allocation Period to be Divided into Four Times Per Month

[Our Newspaper] It is learned that the Central Trust Bureau's artificial silk that has arrived at the port through barter trade with Japan this year has reached more than 6,000 boxes. Therefore, there is no problem with the allocation volume in August, September, and October. It is heard that the monthly allocation will be divided into four weeks, with 2,000 boxes allocated each month. The bureau is scheduled to hold a meeting next week to discuss the allocation method, and it is expected that the allocation will resume next Thursday. The allocation price will be determined based on the market situation next Monday. It is heard that the possible adjustment price will be around 16 million yuan per box. The allocation targets will include newly established silk weaving factories. In addition, the existing quotas will also be considered for adjustment and increase.

### Rice Market Fluctuations are Small, High-Quality Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Move Slightly

Yesterday, the North and South markets had a total of about 4,000 stones of rice. The market situation fluctuated, but the fluctuations were small. New indica rice from various producing areas entered the market one after another, and it is feared that it will be difficult for prices to prosper. The prices of high-quality Japonica and Indica rice in stores moved slightly, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The prices of mid-quality rice were flat. There were still few sales of white rice.

Flour mills have not yet opened, and retail sales moved slightly, weakening first and then firming. As a result, prices rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Unified flour also increased by 2,000 yuan. However, factory flour was more active, while miscellaneous brand flour remained flat. Bran continued to trend sluggish and weak. Soybean cake sales were very sluggish, soybean prices fell, and market sentiment was depressed, resulting in a situation of apparent flatness and hidden weakness. Yellow soybeans are declining daily, with abundant inventory and sluggish sales. Old soybeans fell another 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and new soybeans fell sharply by more than 10,000 yuan. Vegetable oil factories purchased 2,000 to 3,000 packages of Javanese soybeans at noon.

Tea beans were selling flatly, and mid-quality beans continued to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans were in a slump, with supply exceeding demand, and prices fell by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose and fell slightly, showing a slight firmness of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Corn prices fell back, alcohol factories were inactive, and the North Ocean factory was closed, with a sharp drop of 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were flat, and sesame seeds softened.

The oil market's decline stabilized slightly. Soybean oil weakened first and then stabilized, with no significant prosperity. Clear oil prices were flat. Vegetable oil temporarily lacked fluctuations. Crude oil sales continued to be sluggish in the morning market. At the close, Ningbo merchants inquired, turning into firmness, with prices rising by 10,000 yuan.

### Flour Industry Association Again Requests Approval of Purchase Loans

[Our Newspaper] The Fourth District Flour Industry Association stated that the authorities have delayed approving the association's previous proposal for a wheat loan program. Now that new wheat has been on the market for two months, and the purchase period is only three to four months, more than half of the period has already passed, and there can be no further delays. On the 24th, it submitted another letter to the board of directors of the Four-Bank Joint Office, requesting that the previously submitted wheat loan plan be approved as soon as possible. The two main points are excerpted as follows:

"(Omitted) The long delay in approval may have its reasons, but the timing cannot be delayed. It is urgent to seize the current opportunity to meet the hopes of manufacturers. The association has learned that there have been misunderstandings that some factories within the association have already obtained loans. After investigation, it was found that only the Ministry of Food entrusted Shanghai Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Maoxin, and Yutong five factories to purchase wheat and process flour on its behalf, which is not a wheat loan and has nothing to do with the previously submitted wheat loan plan. This is specially clarified, and it is reiterated that the association should request that the plan be approved as soon as possible.

According to reports, the office is drafting a loan program in kind. The association members are deeply concerned that the office may handle the wheat loan case together with the loan in kind program. It is generally believed that there are only two months left for this year's wheat harvest, which is very urgent. If we wait for the implementation of the loan program in kind, the previously submitted wheat loan case may be at a time when there is no wheat to buy. Manufacturers will, in principle, do their best to follow the loan program in kind. However, it is thought that striving for tangible goods should be done one step ahead. The office should first grant the original wheat loan so that the original wheat in various places can be purchased and stored in full. Once the loan program in kind is implemented, it will naturally achieve twice the result with half the effort. Otherwise, if the manufacturers have no grain stored in advance, they will be helpless if they want to follow the loan program in kind. This should be the office should grant the case.

### South China Import and Export Merchants Appeal Three Points to the Economic Commission

[Our Newspaper] It is learned that South China import and export merchants recently held meetings at the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese General Association, repeatedly exchanging views on the new South China trade control measures in detail. Finally, it was decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, and the National Federation of Commerce, appealing for three points:

(1) Requesting relaxation of import quotas. (2) Permitting merchants to pay for imported goods with their own foreign exchange. (3) Requesting the restoration of the convenience of re-exporting goods imported into Guangzhou.

Among the three requests, merchants feel the most urgent need for the last point. Since the Import Management Committee prohibited South China re-export trade on July 1 this year, the business of various merchants has plummeted. British and American import and export merchants also feel that the import trade to the interior of China has been stalled. Therefore, they unanimously requested the opening of re-export trade.

### Domestic Remittance Amount Statistics of Commercial Banks and Firms for Five Months: Surplus in April is the Largest

### "Tiger-Fighting Censor" Wan Can Discusses Why Trade with Japan Should Not Be Opened

— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji

Nanjing, 23rd Quick News

Regarding the question of whether trade with Japan should be opened, there are clearly two different views in the domestic economic circle. One group is more lenient, believing that China has tariff autonomy and adopts management methods for foreign trade, so opening trade with Japan at present will not cause much harm to China. The other group believes that Japan is like an old tiger released from its cage, and China is unprepared. After trade with Japan is opened, it will inevitably evolve into the tragedy of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." Therefore, they advocate suspending consideration of opening trade with Japan before the signing of a peace treaty with Japan and terminating the dispatch of business groups to Japan.

The representatives of the former group are Fan Xiaozheng and Huang Yuanbin, and some government and industrial and commercial figures. The spokespersons for the latter group are Censor Wan Can and Shanghai industrial and commercial leaders Wu Yun Chu and Wu Bo Xiang, etc. Censor Wan Can is the original proposer of the suggestion to suspend opening trade with Japan, so his opinion is particularly worthy of attention. Therefore, I made a special trip to visit him in the summer heat.

The name Wan Can should not be unfamiliar to the people of Shanghai. In the famous Jin Chao case, Wan was one of the four censors who were ordered to go to Shanghai to investigate. Afterwards, Wan and others submitted an impeachment memorial of thousands of words, impeaching Song and others for dereliction of duty, and was temporarily known as the "Tiger-Fighting Censor."

Dangerous Views

Wan opened with anger, saying, "Some people think that opening trade with Japan doesn't matter. This view is really too dangerous. It is true that opening trade with Japan is the decision of MacArthur's headquarters, but this decision suits the taste of the Japanese and is welcomed by the Japanese, so we can call it a decision of the Japanese. Japan uses disguised democracy to win MacArthur's favor and then uses MacArthur to solve Japan's own problems and let China become the end market for its industrial products. We should of course strongly oppose it."

"What's strange is that our government has never had a consistent policy on trade with Japan, and it is always passively accommodating. Whatever decision MacArthur's headquarters makes, we do the same, acting on orders, without any free will. Therefore, several of our supervisory committee members recently put forward an emergency proposal, in addition to advocating the suspension of opening trade with Japan, and hoping that the government can have a comprehensive plan for trade with Japan. On the other hand, we hope that the Allies should also plan for us."

Relationship with Japan

Some people think that the current Sino-Japanese trade is "normal trade" between countries, because of this relationship, they think there is nothing wrong with opening it. Wan thinks this view is wrong. He points out that the main purpose of so-called normal trade is to exchange what one has for what one lacks. One party of the trading country can freely choose what it needs or does not need. But there is no talk of normal trade between China and Japan. First, the peace treaty with Japan has not been signed yet, and we have not received Japan's compensation. Second, we have not established normal diplomatic relations with Japan. So, so far, the relationship between China and Japan is still a relationship between the victorious country and the defeated country, and cannot be confused with "normal relations." After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, what we have always remembered after the victory is to disarm Japan so that it cannot make a comeback. The armament referred to here includes political, economic, and military armaments. Politically, we do not want Japanese fascism to make a comeback and undermine the security of the Far East. Economically, we do not want Japan to expand its overseas markets as a preparation for another aggression. Militarily, we do not want Japan to be able to re-arm. To "completely disarm" Japan, the best way is to sign a peace treaty with Japan and make it hand over all the materials used for aggression in military and economic terms. Before this, restoring trade with Japan and cultivating its strength is tantamount to raising a boil and leaving behind harm. It is not only unwise, but also a dangerous move.

Beneficial to Japan

Before serving as a Censor, Wan served as the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of National Central University and other positions. He is a famous economist in China. According to his research from an economic point of view, opening trade with Japan at this time is only beneficial to Japan, and it can be said that it is of no benefit to China. Wan pointed out that although Japan is a defeated country, its homeland has suffered very little from the war, and the economic damage it has suffered is insignificant. Therefore, it is still an "economic power." On the other hand, China has suffered the greatest losses, and its extremely fragile economic foundation has been almost completely destroyed. Talking about Sino-Japanese trade in this situation will definitely create the bad result of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." What we hope for is "industrial China." Although we do not want Japan to become "agricultural Japan," it should at least be a Japan that cooperates with "industrial China."

Several economic experts do not want to use "political power" as a means to "handle" or "assist" foreign trade. Wan strongly disagrees, pointing out that there is almost no country in the world that does not use "political power" to promote foreign trade, and even the United States is no exception. Why should we be so aloof and shout out such a slogan, especially when it is strangely applied to trade with Japan, which is really confusing.

Tariff Autonomy

The reporter asked Wan, "Mr. Huang Yuanbin once said that our tariffs are completely autonomous, and the government also adopts a policy of managing foreign trade. The quantity and types of foreign goods imported are limited. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about the issue of opening trade with Japan. I wonder what Mr. Wan's opinion is?"

Wan asked back, "Yes, China's tariffs are autonomous, but is the tax rate autonomous? Most of our tax rates must be negotiated before they are set. Can this situation be said to be completely autonomous?"

"Furthermore, the era of tariff policies is over. The trend in the world is to abolish tariff barriers! We should not violate the trend of the times."

Creating Opportunities for Whom

Speaking of this, Wan expressed great dissatisfaction with the person in charge of handling trade with Japan. He said, "If Sino-Japanese trade is unimportant, then I don't know why they are so interested in it. If it is important, then I don't know why they are so perfunctory!" He believes that if it continues to be so sloppy, it will only facilitate those "private trades that have no organizational ability or constructiveness," and more seriously: trade with Japan will facilitate "bureaucratic capital that is organized and destructive." Bureaucratic capital will flock to where there is profit. Japan has "bicycles, watches, cameras," which are really opportunities for them to make a fortune.

Adhering to Principles

Finally, Wan put forward several principles that must be adhered to.

He believes that trade with Japan should definitely be a "political issue" and must be assisted through political means. China's economy is so depressed today entirely because of the "political disaster" given to us by Japan. It is natural and right to use "political solutions" for "political disasters." The damage we have suffered should be compensated by Japan, so that we can recover on the one hand and restrict Japan from rising again on the other.

Secondly, from an economic point of view, China is a country with 400 million buyers and must have an industry that can supply the needs of 400 million people. Therefore, China must become an industrial country. China's economy cannot "form a unit" and must be made self-sufficient in the short term. During this period, we must never allow Japanese goods to invade our market again or take away the market that should have belonged to our country. To achieve this, the government should have a comprehensive plan for the entire trade with Japan and should set up a special agency to handle this matter.

Wan also put forward his view on the competition for the Nanyang market. He said that before the war, the retailers in Nanyang were all Chinese, and the retailers sold Japanese goods. On the one hand, this was due to the underdevelopment of our country's industry, but the main reason was that our country's political power was not strong enough to assist in promotion. Now, although Japan is a defeated country, its industrial level is much higher than before the war. Therefore, we must strive politically, and we should find ways to replace Japan. I remember an American saying that "the Far East should take China as its stabilizing force, and China should become the leader of this vast consumer market in the economy." Foreigners have such high expectations of us, and we should not disappoint them.

### Visiting a Hawksbill Turtle Below Plum Blossom Mountain

— Our Reporter Pu Dejie

Nanjing, 22nd (Express Dispatch)

"A giant turtle discovered on Plum Blossom Mountain!" Nanjing's evening newspaper published a startling piece of news on the 21st. How big is this turtle! How was it discovered on Plum Blossom Mountain? And how can it have two wings on its back? To investigate the truth, braving the intense summer heat, we set out on the Mausoleum Boulevard.

Giant Turtle! Does it Have Wings?

We first arrived at the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Management Committee. They then led us to the Mausoleum Garden Management Office below Plum Blossom Mountain. We saw the "giant turtle." In a cement pool less than ten feet in diameter, with a shallow layer of water and duckweed floating on the surface, a shelled creature lay quietly. Its yellowish-brown carapace was as large as a small round table, divided like a turtle's shell into thirteen main scutes and twenty-five smaller scutes around the edges. It had no tail, and its four large flippers, covered with tiny scales, lay flat. No wonder some people said it had wings. Its grayish-silken head and neck resembled those of a giant python, spending most of its time submerged in the water. This was a "hawksbill turtle," an animal that lives in the sea. Plum Blossom Mountain was simply its new home.

Three Hawksbill Turtles from the Xisha Islands

In the latter part of April this year, our National Defense Forces stationed in the Xisha Islands successively captured three hawksbill turtles in the waters around the islands. Subsequently, a transport ship from the central government transported them back north in wooden cages. The largest one died of starvation on the way, another was sent to Guangzhou as a gift to the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the remaining one was transferred to Taiwan and then, via the U.S. Meisong vessel, was shipped through Shanghai to Beijing. On July 20th, the Naval Headquarters dispatched a truck and eight laborers to deliver it to the Mausoleum Management Committee. This gift caused the recipients considerable concern. First, they lacked the facilities to raise animals, and second, they had no understanding of the living habits of hawksbill turtles. How could they keep it alive?

Food Costs Difficult to Bear

The Mausoleum Management Committee quickly consulted the Naval Headquarters and temporarily placed it in the pool of the Garden Management Office's farm. They used saltwater to soak it and prepared small fish, shrimp, and fruits to feed it.

The Naval Headquarters' reply arrived, stating that a pond should be built for it, with sand on the bottom and a few rocks placed inside. It should be fed artificial seawater, shrimp, and small fish. The Mausoleum Management Committee calculated that this expense was not small. Even without considering the cost of building the pond, just the food costs alone were unbearable. The Management Committee is considering that if they cannot afford its food, they will prepare to send it to a zoo in Shanghai or Qingdao to live as a "retired gentleman."

Entering the Wooden Cage, it Prefers to Starve

The hawksbill turtle is extremely fierce. In the shallow pool, it does not have enough buoyancy and cannot move freely. Its bulging eyes and nostrils are submerged in the water, and it constantly blows bubbles out of anger. Unexpectedly, it suddenly strikes with its two front flippers, splashing water everywhere, throwing a tantrum. It is said that this hawksbill turtle has not eaten anything since being placed in the wooden cage. The Naval Headquarters and the Mausoleum Management Committee are both concerned about its health, fearing that its starvation may lead to unfortunate consequences. Plum Blossom Mountain is not a suitable place for a hawksbill turtle. Living in the vast ocean, how can it be willing to be trapped in a mud puddle smaller than an acre? (Attached photo: Yu Peiqing)

### Sino-British Aviation Agreement

From Our Newspaper Archives

The Sino-British Aviation Agreement was signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 23rd of this month. The British Civil Aviation Delegation, led by Sir Baldwin, came to China to negotiate the Sino-British Aviation Agreement. After three months of discussions, an agreement has been reached. Last December, the Sino-American Aviation Agreement was first established, beginning to lead China's aviation industry onto the international stage. This time, the British government, under the principle of cooperation, is also assisting China's aviation industry in expanding to Southeast Asia and Europe. During our eight years of resistance against Japan, all reconstruction work was complex and multifaceted, especially in terms of materials and technology, which required international assistance. Although aviation has been actively developed, with increased flights and the opening of new routes, various restrictions have prevented it from reaching its ideal state. Now, the United States and the United Kingdom are guiding our country's aviation to expand abroad, creating a new situation for China's air transport.

The Sino-British Aviation Agreement stipulates a validity period of four years, during which either party may notify the other party at any time to terminate it after one year. This provision is the same as the Sino-American Aviation Agreement.

Aviation Stations

Designated within our country are Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Kunming. Within the United Kingdom and its territories, there are London, Prestwick, Singapore, Kota Kinabalu, Labuan, Kuching, Penang, and Hong Kong. Both parties have stipulated seven routes. For long-distance routes, our country has two lines, east and west. One flies across the Americas to reach the United Kingdom, and the other passes through India, North Africa, Europe to reach the United Kingdom. Both of the British lines pass through Europe and Africa to China. The rest start from various parts of Southeast Asia.

Foreign aviation is for our country to strive for international status and to facilitate the economic activities of overseas Chinese. Southeast Asia is the area where overseas Chinese are concentrated. The economy of Southeast Asia is mainly based on overseas Chinese, and its impact on the motherland is also very significant. Therefore, our country's operation of foreign routes should initially focus on Southeast Asia, so as to assist the economic development of overseas Chinese. In this Sino-British Aviation Agreement, six of the eight shipping stations stipulated by the British side are located in areas where overseas Chinese are concentrated. Among the seven routes, five can connect China and Southeast Asia. This is enough to show the government's attention to Southeast Asia.

Hong Kong-Shanghai Line

There was a slight dispute over the issue of commercial operations during the negotiation process. The British side requested equal rights, while our country believed that British aircraft should focus on long-distance international transport and did not need to operate this line. Because Hong Kong has a special status, and its airport is located in Kowloon, a leased territory. For the sake of maintaining civil aviation, Lingguo (Britain) seemed unwilling to agree. However, the British side strongly argued for this point. After several discussions, it was learned that the British side would use seaplanes to fly to Shanghai. Our country temporarily agreed, but the transportation volume was restricted, stipulating that the round trip should not exceed one hundred seats per week. After one year, if an increase is desired, the consent of both parties must first be obtained. This approach is for the relevant Sino-British airlines to exchange documents to ensure compliance. (For other aspects, please refer to page 2 of the 24th issue of this newspaper.)

Beforehand, everyone suspected what ambitions Britain had in the Far East regarding the Sino-British Aviation Agreement. But from the various clauses of the agreement, it seems that there is great potential for cooperation between China and the United Kingdom. In terms of shipping stations, the British side only enjoys transport rights in four places within our territory, while our country obtains transport rights in eight places within British territory and its possessions, which is double that of the British side. Both parties have stipulated seven routes, and our country has not received fewer than the British side, and most are in the Southeast Asian region, directly providing great convenience to overseas Chinese and indirectly benefiting our country. As for the construction of seaplane facilities and the establishment of emergency landing stations, they are essential for the safety of navigation, and there is no loss in terms of sovereignty.

Our country's air transport industry is gradually expanding abroad, striving for international status, which has revealed a very good prospect. With the development of air transport, the need for aviation equipment will inevitably increase. It is hoped that our country's aviation engineering can meet the needs of all construction industries and gradually develop, so that our country's aviation industry will develop by leaps and bounds.

Legal Interpretation

Landlord's Tyranny: Eviction Notice, Housing Difficult to Find, Nowhere to Go

Dear Editor: My friend Mr. Hu rented a piece of land with several thatched houses from the Zhang family in the autumn of the 31st year of the Republic of China to open a vegetable garden. At that time, a contract was signed stating (A) the rent was calculated in counterfeit reserve notes, guaranteed by two shopkeepers; if there were any arrears, the lease could be terminated at any time; (B) half a year's rent was used as a deposit without interest; (C) the lease term was five years, and the rent could not be increased or decreased; (D) all property taxes were to be paid by the lessee. Three years after Mr. Hu moved into the house, Mr. Zhang refused to collect the rent on the grounds that it was too low. This April, he again used the excuse of taking it back for his own use and asked to reclaim the house. In this time of housing shortage, it is very difficult to find a house. May I ask (1) What multiple of the rent should be paid for the arrears from the winter of the 34th year to the present? If Mr. Zhang refuses to accept it, can it be deposited? (2) After the expiration of the term, can the contract be renewed and continue to live there? (3) All property taxes and income taxes are paid by the friend; can they be used to offset the rent arrears? (4) The landlord currently has other houses to use; can his request be refused? (5) Mr. Zhang hired a lawyer to send Mr. Hu an eviction notice. How should it be handled? Please answer the above five points, and I will be grateful. Reader Wang Zhongyue.

[Answer from Lawyer Duanmu Kai] (1) Starting from December of the 34th year of the Republic of China, pay 40 times the rent of July of the 26th year of the Republic of China. Starting from March of the 36th year of the Republic of China, pay 140 times the rent of July of the 26th year of the Republic of China. If he refuses to accept it, you can deposit it yourself. (2) The residential contract should be renewed according to the original contract. (3) The property taxes and income taxes paid can be used to offset the rent. (4) You can refuse. (5) You should write a letter to the lawyer detailing the actual situation, and have him pass it on to the landlord.

Spring and Autumn

### The Enlightenment Teacher

— Huangfu Taiyun

The flow of time never stops, but on flat riverbeds, it appears calm to us on the surface. However, in the gorges with high and low cliffs, its changes and rapids are terrifying.

One afternoon in February, the weather was warm, as if it were early summer. At the intersection of the main street, in a row of used bookstores, I saw a tall, thin middle-aged man wearing a grayish-black cotton robe. He seemed to be rushing to the market, pushing his way in with some effort, politely saying, "Please let me pass." He squeezed to the front of the bookstore owner's red-lacquered table, stacked a large pile of thread-bound books held under his arm on the table, and then talked to the short, broad-faced shop owner. After about ten minutes, he squeezed out empty-handed. At this time, I caught a glimpse of a familiar face: bald, high cheekbones, a pointed chin, and a curved nose above a short mustache. His gloomy face seemed brighter than when he went in, but it was still indifferent. I felt that I should say hello to him - I couldn't be wrong, he was my childhood enlightenment teacher.

"Mr. Chen, are you here too?" I said.

He scratched his head and stared at me, a look of surprise and shame appearing on his face. He slowly said, "Oh, I don't remember, who are you?"

I wasn't surprised by his astonishment (I expected it). I explained to him, "My name is Rong _, I was your student when you taught at A Town and lived next door to the pharmacy in that new house."

"Oh!" He drew out the sound, trying to hide his embarrassment, "You were reading Five-Character Tang Poems back then? How quickly times have changed!"

"Yes, yes," I agreed with him, although I had never read Five-Character Tang Poems.

Afterwards, I felt that I should ask him about how he came to be here, what kind of job he was doing, and whether he was still doing the same thing.

"I don't even know how I ended up here," a bitter smile appeared on his cold face. "I'm like a woodpecker, wandering around, contacting countless people and things; but I can't remember any of them. You ask me about jobs? I can't name one. I haven't been a teacher since I left there."

He restrained his only smile, and his face became even gloomier. Obviously, the past life was unfamiliar and unpleasant to him. If I were to ask him to tell it, it would only evoke a series of memories of struggle, frustration, decline, and wandering.

I realized that I had led him into a circle of depression, so I quickly set aside the original topic and asked about his address.

After a slight hesitation, he copied the address of his temporary residence on a small piece of paper - it was a small lodging house.

After that, he left, hurriedly squeezing through the crowded street and turning into a small alley.

I turned back to the shop owner. He was single-mindedly flipping through that pile of worm-eaten, yellowed ancient woodblock-printed books, with a delicate vermilion circle marking each pause in the page. The blank spaces in the book were filled with explanations. These were also familiar to me, like decorations on my body. Indeed, I couldn't bear to let them be lost in this shop, to be taken away by some unknown person in the future.

After some negotiation with the shop owner, I finally spent 12,000 yuan to buy the book. I planned to take it to visit my enlightenment teacher.

The next day, I took this ancient book and followed the address he gave me to find him. But I found nothing. A simple, middle-aged woman came out of the dark inn. She plainly told me that there had been such a guest in the inn, but he had already left yesterday.

A cloud of sorrow that could not be dispelled hung in my heart. He, Mr. Chen, had infected me with something I had never had before, and it was so easy to make people feel heavy and old.

"How quickly times have changed!" I said sadly.

When I was seven years old, a wealthy landlord named Fan built a tall building on a vacant lot next to my house. When the building was about to be completed, the landlord decided to open a private school there. Although schools had been established for several years at that time, private schools were still considered the proper places to teach, according to custom and tradition. So my father immediately sent me there.

After worshiping Confucius, my father pointed to the tall, thin Mr. Chen with the arched nose and date-pit face and said, "Kneel down and bow to the teacher." I did as he said. At this time, there were already twenty or thirty children of roughly the same age who had arrived before me.

Later, I gradually learned that Mr. Chen was also a disciple of Zhang Tianshi, who performed religious services for the dead. However, in addition to drawing some talismans to ward off ghosts and suppress evil spirits, he could also read some scriptures. Therefore, he had already paved the way for "teaching" at that time. When he went to perform religious services for people, we would have a day or several days off.

At that time, I was reading the "Three Character Classic." In the morning, I automatically took the book to Mr. Chen's table near the upstairs window. Mr. Chen picked up a pen dipped in vermilion ink, read a sentence and added a circle, and I would read a sentence with him. After reading the four lines, we would repeat them twice. After that, it was my own work. The diligent or naughty children would read these few sentences all day long, reciting them until they were thoroughly familiar. In the afternoon, I would copy a "Shang Da Ren" and hand it in. It was considered complete only if I could stand in front of the teacher in the evening, turn my back, and swing back and forth while reciting the day's lesson to the teacher in its entirety. If I couldn't recite it, a few slaps on the palm could also pass.

I only studied there for a year, but I skipped half a year of classes. So I can't say how much Mr. Chen benefited me. Only under his strict and unremitting supervision did I swallow the shallow but profound sentences of "Nature is near, habits are far," which contain Confucian philosophy, and force them into my memory.

After the new year, my father sent me to a primary school in the street. Since then, on the seesaw, slide, and swing set, I had long forgotten whether the private school was still open, and whether the Taoist teacher was still sitting as coldly as an ancient stone statue in that new white wood building, circling the children's textbooks and adding circles and annotations to his own ancient scriptures.

After the islanders came, A Town was burned to the ground, and the Chunyang Palace where Mr. Chen lived was not spared. Only that white wood house remained standing. But it was no longer a private school, and a political institution was stationed there.

Times have changed. The rebuilt A Town after the recovery no longer had a "private school" for him to teach in, and even religious services were rarely offered to him. It is said that he wandered to other places.

The vision of time is absent in the eyes of us young people, unless someone mentions it. We are indeed fortunate to temporarily avoid this burden of human sorrow - those like Mr. Chen who lack an accurate view of life cannot withstand this change in human affairs, and they will lament that the times have "become terrible."

### Cigarette Butt

— Wang Dai

Who abandoned his kiss on the quiet roadside?

Like an empty wine bottle smashed on the hard stone!

Who wants to think about the past illusion of intoxication over and over again;

The emptiness afterwards only provokes his agitated mood.

The red fire is still burning under the remaining ashes,

Like eyes that are hard to close, covered with a layer of thick eyelashes.

The lip marks on the end of the cigarette still seem to be slightly moist,

Perhaps soon a faint green mold will be added.

Once it was also the dream in someone's eyes and the love in their heart;

Turning into a dragon, a snake, the long hair of a woman of love, a thousand strands of wandering silk,

Turning into the all-encompassing Luo Ji to capture your fickle heart;

Turning into a beautiful white daffodil withering in the breeze.

But who wants to think about the past illusion of intoxication over and over again!

Now it will die bleakly, leaving not even a wisp of light smoke.

### Landscape

— Xue Sili

(Aureotsrty 1834-1899) was one of the richest people among writers. He was not originally an aspiring painter, but he began his artistic life because he met two painter friends—Renoir and Monet.

He painted many landscapes, greatly influenced by Monet. His brushstrokes are lively but simple, and his colors are gorgeous but not vulgar. He is known as one of the three major landscape painters of Impressionism. (Liu Shi)

### Small City

— Song Zhu Ping

Amidst the misty drizzle, with a melancholy heart, I love to wander alone on the muddy streets of the small city.

The small city is so shabby: the city walls are covered with green moss and are dilapidated, the streets are filthy and narrow. Along the roadside are two rows of low, dark earthen houses, already showing their age, antiquity, and imminent decay. On the walls are patches of peeling yellow soil. The eaves, dripping with water, are weighed down by years of wind and sand, almost collapsing, lightly covering two smelly, sunless gutters all year round. The weather is changeable, and even in June, there can be bewildering sandstorms covering the sky. Thus, everything in this small city, except for a few green poplars, is covered with a layer of earthy yellow. In the morning and evening, the streets are filled with blue cooking smoke. At dusk, the desert atmosphere of the small city becomes even stronger. When the drizzle is lingering, the scenery of the small city is shrouded in a moderate gloom. This gloom makes people feel empty, lonely, and cold. It also allows them to appreciate a subtle, inexpressible beauty of melancholy.

Similarly, the residents of this small city still belong to that group of people who are poor and content with their lot. For the sake of survival, they work tirelessly from morning till night, without any complaints. They also pursue a minimal level of stability in their lives that they can tolerate. Frequent disasters are only a series of low sighs on their anemic and pale faces. Although the small city has also conscripted soldiers and demanded grain, it has not been threatened by war. Therefore, the small city still has a strong atmosphere of conservatism and tranquility. People are always silent, calmly letting suffering slip away in sighs, and letting time pass in indifference. They seem to have no ideals or hopes, and all their pastimes are just running to the teahouse, or setting up a game of Chinese chess at the street corner, or finding a stringed instrument and singing a few local operas. These things make them feel satisfied. The dim vegetable oil lamp illuminates their birth and also illuminates their death. This ordinariness, however, makes one feel the earnestness and seriousness of ordinary life.

The small city, which has been eroded by wind and sand all year round, once had a period of prosperity. However, it was only a flash in the pan, and following the prosperity was a period of recession, so it declined, and the small city became even more anemic and aged. However, people are not accustomed to the ups and downs of the sea of people. The streets of the small city on rainy days are still so muddy, and still retain that charm of gloom in the rain.

Not long ago, I left the small city and had to return again. The small city still maintained its inherent charm. Amidst the misty drizzle, with a wounded heart, I walked again on the muddy streets of the small city. At dusk, the gloom of the streets of this small city is even more likely to cause sadness and nostalgia. In the hazy light, I saw碉堡s built on the hills around the small city, and armed sentries stood tall on the dilapidated city walls. In the evening, the sparse gunfire was accompanied by the evening bell of the church, gently breaking the nearly twenty years of tranquility of the small city. However, the small city was still the same as usual, and did not feel the cruelty and waste of war, or the more misfortune brought by war, because of this shocking gunfire. (End of June, Pingliang.)

### Dusk

— Zhi Feng

I cherish every dusk in this long series of days.

We slowly stepped along, passing through the embankment lined with weeping willows, draped in a gray hue. However, our hearts are bright and surging. We are constantly tracking, trying to seize some lofty imagination.

We turned into a cemetery path, with green grave grass and tall tomb trees. Between them was a layer of gray-yellow. It was so gloomy that we seemed to see the shadows of many ghosts. However, our hearts are bright and surging. We want to see these shadows.

Piles of graves, decades ago, turned into white bones, but these shadows come to life in our imagination. We seem to see them waving their fists, bulging their veins, falling down, convulsing, and shedding their last drop of blood...

She stood still. From the vast gray, I saw a serious face. From the serious face, I felt a devout heart.

I cannot hold her arm. I should not make her laugh, because from these imagined shadows, she discovered her true self. She had already allowed herself to participate in the center of these shadows. She saw the hand waving the fist, the blue veins on the forehead, the fallen body, the gushing blood...

I quietly listened to the beating of that devout heart. I silently blessed her and prayed for her: to discover some more lofty images from the shadows of fists, blue veins, corpses, and blood...

"May these images always live in our hearts!" She smiled. From the silver bell-like laughter, I felt that what was before me was not a gray dusk, and what was behind me was not a dark night. I imagined us taking vigorous steps in a scarlet dawn.

"Yes, let these images be placed in front of our ranks, and let them lead us to that rational journey and destination!"

She was silent. From the silence, I felt a kind of silent agreement. I smiled. I felt younger, stronger, and more invigorated!…

We held each other tightly. We could clearly count the rhythmic heartbeats. I knew our imaginations merged into one, following those shadows, rushing on our journey…

### One Inch of Land, One Inch of Blood 358

— Ye Jing Feng

I smiled and said, "Your Aunt Ji must have her plans. We haven't figured it out yet, so don't offend her. It will make it difficult for Aunt Ji to handle things."

"I know, Uncle..." He also smiled, and said to me, "You walk slowly, I'll take a step ahead..." As he spoke, Little Tiger had already run away; along the mountain path, down the mountain, and into the forest.

When I walked to the edge, Big Dummy was already poking his head out, turning out from the corner of a thatched hut; probably to greet me. But he never came over, as if afraid of being seen. He just stood by the thatched hut and waited.

"Secretary-General!" he whispered, "Just around the bend... but Miss Ji is sleeping soundly, she hasn't woken up yet..." As he spoke, he turned and winked at me, walking close to the thatched hut.

The North is not like the South; a 片陰暗 but not humid. But this gloomy atmosphere is very dreary. I thought Yaoqun was only in her twenties, in the golden age of a woman. Not to compare her with those young ladies in the Jiangnan police world, it seems she should not waste her beautiful youth in this desolate valley, and be constantly risking her life, fighting with a group of demons and ghosts. But who called her to be born in this great era; who called her to be involved in the very peak of this surging wave?

"Don't disturb her!" Before entering the house, I instructed Big Dummy: "Let her sleep a little longer; I can wait, and it's a good opportunity to rest..."

Is this even considered a house? As soon as I entered, a smell of sand and mud rushed into my nostrils. The roof was so low that I could reach the rafters with my hand; the four walls were all earthen walls, and they were leaning to one side; probably if there were not a few small trees blocking the wind and rain, just a small storm could lift the roof and collapse the earthen walls. There was indeed an inner and outer room, and the wall separating the inner and outer room was a straw mat that paved the ground in the large courtyards of Beiping, supported by two pieces of wood. Not to compare this with the high-rise buildings in Shanghai or Beiping, even the bungalows in Changxindian are worlds apart from this place.

There were two small tables in the house that looked like a peddler's stall board, and a few broken stools; but there was no bed, and the two piles of wheat straw and sorghum stalks laid in the corner were probably the beds. The only light came from two sources; in addition to the light shining in from the front door, there was also a small, irregular hole in the wall; the rest was the faint light leaking in from the broken holes in the roof; if the front door was closed, it would be as dark as a cave.

Dingyuan took off his monk's robe and wore a set of purple-flowered coarse cloth clothes. It was about eighty percent new; he stood aside nodding and smiling at me, making gestures without speaking, for fear of waking Yaoqun. Little Tiger stood behind Dingyuan, drinking water from the mouth of an earthen pot, as if afraid that someone would snatch it from him.

I tried to reduce the sound of my leather boots; but as soon as I stepped in, I heard Yaoqun yawning; the wheat straw rustled, as if she was turning over in bed.

Shanghai Vignettes

### Friends of Chinese News

— Shi Lang

The US Information Service will drastically reduce its funding starting August 1st. In addition to downsizing its operations nationwide, it will also lay off a large number of employees. This move is regrettable.

We feel a sense of closeness to the US Information Service because this organization "fought side by side" with our news community during the War of Resistance. It often provided the impoverished Chinese news community with many practical forms of assistance in various difficult material environments.

For example, all news materials reporting on the war against the enemy, strategic maps of enemy and us combat, and printing plates that could not be transported during the war, all helped the Chinese wartime news community and the readers of Chinese newspapers. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the work of the US Information Service not only expanded but also deepened. The number of offices nationwide also increased, which benefited the national news community even more. In particular, newspapers in the interior that could not obtain telegrams and special articles from foreign news agencies undoubtedly welcomed the contributions of the US Information Service even more.

However, we are very surprised that the US State Department rejected the funding for the US Information Service to operate in China, so that this organization will enter a state of semi-paralysis. In any case, this is a very regrettable thing.

We hope that the US State Department can focus on the entire China—especially the newspapers in small cities, which need the help of the US Information Service so much. We hope that the US State Department can reconsider and withdraw this unwise decision to tighten up the organization and reduce funding.

If possible, the US State Department can solicit the opinions of the Chinese news community, and it will definitely get the same answer.

Free Talk

### The Death of Ruan Muhan

— Bai Ma

Not long after the July 7th Incident and the fall of Beiping into the hands of the Japanese invaders, I saw a news item in Nanjing, which stated: University professor Ruan Muhan led hundreds of guerrillas to break through from Beiping and fought the Japanese invaders in the Western Hills. Since then, I have been paying attention to the name "Ruan Muhan."

In the twenty-eighth year, I saw another news item in the Japanese newspaper in Manila, which stated: The enemy guerrilla leader Ruan Muhan has now been arrested by our side and is being interrogated. At that time, I thought he was probably going to die for the cause. But he was still young, and I hoped that he would not die immediately, and would contribute more to the War of Resistance. In the thirty-first year, I went to Chongqing and got news of him, saying that before he was about to be executed, the prison guard secretly released him by faking his crime. In the thirty-fourth year, Japan surrendered, and the CCP occupied Chahar. He was appointed president of the Chahar Higher Court, and later transferred to secretary-general of the Chahar Provincial Government. At this point, I knew that he was a CCP member. Last winter, the National Army recovered Chahar. When he fled from Zhangjiakou to Xiahuayuan, for some reason, the CCP authorities ordered him to be shot dead on the spot!

His name was Mingqi, Muhan was his courtesy name. He was from Chaigoubao, Huaian County, Chahar. He was about forty-five or forty-six years old. He was about four feet six or seven inches tall, with a round face, short neck, and nearsightedness. Even with extremely high-powered glasses, he could not see people very clearly. Therefore, in middle school, his classmates gave him the nickname "Blind Ruan." After graduating from Chaigoubao Elementary School, he first entered Xuanhua Middle School (formerly Zhili Provincial No. 16 Middle School) for one year, and then transferred to Luhe Middle School in Tongxian. After graduating from Youhe Middle School, he went to Japan to study economics at Keio University in Tokyo. He probably joined the Communist Party when he was in Tokyo. When he was in Tokyo, the student uniform he wore was not only old, but also had large holes in the elbows. He was from a wealthy family, with more than 2,000 mu of good land. Why was he so inhuman? I was very strange at the time. Now I think, he probably deliberately showed that he was definitely not a bourgeois, but a genuine proletariat! After graduating from Keio University, he returned to China and worked as a lecturer at the Sino-French University in Beiping and the Tianjin School of Law and Commerce. He was not very successful, and seemed very lonely. He lived in his own exquisite small residence in the Western City, and his wife and children were brought out from Chaigoubao.

In this turbulent century, the killing of a person is not a big deal, but the death of a person like Ruan Muwei is worthy of study. Because first, he was a person who extremely believed in Marxism. His participation in the Communist Party was definitely not comparable to the blind following of ordinary young people. He should be absolutely loyal to the CCP. Second, he did not die at the hands of the Japanese invaders, nor at the hands of the enemy party, but died at the hands of the CCP to which he was loyal. At this point, we can't help but ask: Why did the CCP kill him? I think there are only two reasons: First, as a result of the struggle between Mao Zedong's faction and the International faction, Ruan may have been from the International faction, so the Mao faction took the opportunity to kill him. But this is purely speculation, without any evidence, and there are two points: (1) He did not go north to Mongolia, but went south to Beiping; (2) He did not take his family with him, but left them in Zhangyuan, where the National Army was about to arrive. This can be used as evidence to show that the former inference is not true. Then, the second reason should be that he was completely dissatisfied with the CCP's policies and style, and attempted to escape from Zhangyuan to Beiping to rehabilitate himself. I remember when Ruan was the secretary-general of the CCP Chahar Provincial Government, a Chahar gentry named Qiao, who was hiding in Beiping, secretly asked someone to bring Ruan a note, asking if he could return to Zhangyuan. Ruan immediately told the person who brought the note: "Don't come back, it's okay if you succeed." From this sentence, it can be seen that he was indeed dissatisfied with the CCP, and placed his hopes on the opposing party. Asking Ruan in the underworld about this inference should get his approval!

As an advanced and pure young man who studied economics, extremely believed in Marxism, and dedicated himself to the CCP for more than ten years, why did he suddenly become dissatisfied with the CCP? This is something that readers should think about deeply.

### Britain, the Soviet Union, and Xinjiang

— Meng Ping

Since the Beitashan incident, the people have paid special attention to the Xinjiang issue. There have also been many introductions to the past and present situation of Xinjiang. The future development and evolution of Xinjiang, together with Suiyuan and Chahar in Inner Mongolia and the nine northeastern provinces, have undoubtedly become a unified whole, judging from the recent rumors.

The Soviet Union should be the first to lay the foundation for its power in Xinjiang. Seeing the Soviet Union's power extending eastward, in order to maintain its interests in India and Tibet, the British had to try their best to expand their power in Xinjiang to resist.

In the era of Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union established consulates in Yili, Tacheng, Kashgar, Turpan, Hami, Dihua, and Gucheng in Xinjiang after the signing of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (the Treaty of the Return of Yili) in 1881 (the seventh year of Guangxu), allowing Russians to do business in Xinjiang tax-free. At this time, the actual power in Xinjiang was actually in the hands of the Russians.

After the Russian Revolution, it declared that it would abandon the privileges of the Imperial Russian era in China, which the Chinese people were very happy to hear. However, the Soviet Union used various agencies in Xinjiang and the complexity of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang to establish communist propaganda agencies and political organizations in Yili, Tacheng, Dihua, and other places, engaging in the Xinjiang Soviet Union movement, and plotting to seize the political power in Xinjiang. Yang Zengxin's assassination of Fan Yaonan in 1928 (the seventeenth year of the Republic of China) and Sheng Shicai's defeat of Ma Zhongying in 1934 (the twenty-third year of the Republic of China) can be said to be the proud work of the Soviet Union behind the scenes. Today, Ahmedjiang's opposition to Messwood, judging from previous examples, can be said to be still in the same style.

In 1896 (the twenty-second year of Guangxu), Russia and Britain signed the Pamir Treaty in London, and although China protested, Britain and the Soviet Union ignored it. China lost the Seven Pamirs (Great Pamir, Little Pamir, Alchuk Pamir, Sadenz Pamir, Shkuzhuk Pamir, Lankuli Pamir, Wakhan Pal). The Pamirs are a key location, and they are the gateway for China, the Soviet Union, and Britain to enter and exit. Although Britain's 箝制 could not seize all of it, dividing it into a rate was enough for it to attack and defend in order to defend against the Soviet Union.

In 1930 (the nineteenth year of the Republic of China), British Doctor Stein secretly entered the new general and discovered oil fields near the Tianshan Mountains, and privately signed an excavation contract with the people of Kashgar, which was later withdrawn due to Chinese protests. In 1931 (the twentieth year of the Republic of China), the British government sent military attaché Stafford to organize the Xinjiang Expedition Team. Its transportation tools not only used cars, but also airplanes, to conduct detailed investigations of Xinjiang's politics, military affairs, and economy, and at the same time produced extremely detailed maps of Xinjiang. When the Turpan riots broke out, retired British officers also joined in. In January 1934 (the twenty-third year of the Republic of China), Kashgar's independent movement leader Demla established the "Chinese Turkestan Government," although it only lasted for half a year and disintegrated when Ma Zhongying's siege of Dihua failed. But Britain's activities in Xinjiang can be clearly seen in the above facts.

When Sheng Shicai unified Xinjiang, the Kashgar movement failed, the Soviet Union won, and Britain retired. It can be said that the struggle between Britain and the Soviet Union reached the end stage. The power in Xinjiang was completely in the hands of the Russians thereafter.

### Animal Sensitivity

— Wu Xing Hong

If people encounter a situation where there is no clock or watch, and estimate what time it is based on guesswork, the result will always have a difference of half an hour or a quarter of an hour. However, small animals such as bees can estimate the time very accurately. According to experiments by British scientists, they placed food for feeding bees at a place not far from the hive every day at a fixed time, and those bees would definitely fly to take the food on time, never being late or early by a few minutes. The special time perception of bees can be seen from this.

Some kinds of flies have a particularly keen sense of taste. If the composition of a cup of liquid contains only one part of sugar in 40,000 parts, this fly can still taste the sweetness. Even stronger than the fly's sense of taste is the butterfly. If the sugar content in the solution only accounts for one part in 300,000, the butterfly can still taste the sweetness in the solution.

The moth has an extremely strong sense of smell. If you catch a female moth and place it in the window, after a while, a group of male moths will fly from afar and stop at the window. Because the male moths smelled the scent of the female moth and came to track it. The famous entomologist Fabre once used moths to experiment, and learned that a certain male moth can know the location of a female moth from a mile away.

### Random Talks While Anchored Alone

— Wang Cong

Habitual moral concepts cannot withstand deeper thought.

Pork becoming food for human beings is a matter of course. The reason for this is simply a way of life for human beings.

Moral concepts under vulgar habits do not have sufficient reason as a basis. Human beings! These creatures praised as civilized still retain some habitual bestial selfish desires, as well as hypocrisy that is more terrible than wild beasts.

Some people say that the only thing that makes human beings superior to animals is the ability to laugh, but the meaning of laughter is the most incomprehensible mystery; the "answer" may be extremely ugly. Who says that human beings are necessarily more advanced than animals?

I think that philanthropists who pass by a pork shop will not have any sad feelings about the hanging pig's head, because pork is originally human food. Is this so-called "human justice" really reasonable?

If the history of human beings develops more simply, then facing the hanging human head, one cannot help but arouse the appetite of the same kind!

Vulgar moral laws! The true value is despised.

When the Nazis were flaunting their power in Europe, what was the difference between Germany and India? A caring person answered well: "Germany is where millions of people are starving for one person, while India is where one person is starving for millions of people."

The words are short but the meaning is long. If there is only one truth, I don't know if it should side with the tyrant or stand on the side of the millions of people? Smart readers naturally know more clearly than I do.

Brother C, who just returned from Germany, told me a new fable that is quite widely spread among the German people:

One day, Hitler saw three elementary school students on the road. He suddenly wanted to hold a public opinion test.

"Who do you say victory will belong to after this war?" Old Hitler asked.

"It belongs to England!" One student answered truthfully.

Old Hitler frowned and asked another student the same question.

"It belongs to the United States."

Old Hitler was angry and asked the last student, "What do you mean?"

The last student raised his left hand and patted his left chest, saying, "Of course it belongs to us!" The tone was very firm and powerful. Old Hitler happily raised his thumb to agree with him. But, strangely, the student's left hand always tightly stroked his left chest. Old Hitler discovered this special gesture and asked in surprise, "Why is your hand always resting on your chest?"

The student's hand left his left chest, and it turned out that the word "Jew" was clearly embroidered on it.

### Miscellany from America

— Xu Shuyuan

The Nuances of Making Phone Calls

The rules for making phone calls in America are slightly different from those in China. In Shanghai, each phone call costs one thousand yuan, regardless of whether it connects or not. And in Shanghai, most hotel and restaurant phones rarely connect. If you dial for a while and are told that someone is already using the line, you still have to pay your thousand yuan. It's like going to a movie theater and not seeing the movie, but still having to pay for the ticket—what a ridiculous and strange tale. It's not like that in America. Local calls cost five cents each. You first pick up the receiver, put a five-cent coin into the phone's slot, and then dial the number. If the call doesn't go through, you hang up, and the nickel drops back into the coin return, remaining your property. The phone company doesn't take advantage of you. For long-distance calls, you need to know the nuances. If you simply give the operator the number, and they connect the line, but the person you're calling isn't found, you haven't achieved your purpose, but you still have to pay the phone bill. If, when giving the operator the number, you add "Person to person call," then if they can't find the person, you don't have to pay, because your purpose wasn't achieved, even though the phone company has provided service for you. If you want to make a long-distance call but don't want to spend the money, you can pass the responsibility of paying to the other party. Just add the phrase "Collect," and the phone company will collect the money from the other party. I'm most afraid of these skinflint friends. Once, a big shot from Washington called me long distance from another place, but he didn't want to pay himself. He learned the nuances and told the phone company to bill me. The phone operator was truly remarkable. She said, "A Chinese gentleman is calling you; are you willing to pay?" I considered it for a moment and thought that seventy-five cents wasn't too much to pay. Then she connected the line. That gentleman then claimed his airplane travel expenses and long-distance phone bill from Washington, truly the epitome of shrewdness. Paying for long-distance calls with cash is done after the call. Because the operator can't estimate the time beforehand, after the call, she tells you a number, for example, three dollars and ninety-five cents. You prepare a handful of coins. You put six half-dollars into the phone, then three quarters, then two dimes, and then one nickel, totaling three dollars and ninety-five cents. The operator listens entirely by ear for the sound of the coins falling. If you're dishonest and try to pass off a penny as a dime, she can clearly distinguish the difference by the sound. (29)
