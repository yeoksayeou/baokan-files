It is rumored that after the announcement of this statement, all economic, political, and military affairs will adopt a wartime system, such as strengthening conscription, grain requisition, and price controls.

### Miscellaneous Notes on Sino-U.S. Phone Calls

The Telecommunications Bureau completed the installation of Sino-U.S. wireless telephone equipment in late May and has been testing the calls day and night for a month. The initial results were very good. Recently, due to sunspots affecting the transmission of speech waves, the current call time is tentatively set from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM the next morning.

Yesterday, the number of people registering at the Telecommunications Bureau was very crowded, totaling 37 households. However, only nine calls were made last night, including Mayor Wu's return call. This newspaper accounted for two calls. One was a call from Jack Deker, editor of the Hearst Daily News in New York, to Wu Jiatang, the interviewing director of this newspaper, which was also the first Sino-U.S. commercial telephone call. The second was a call from the editing department of this newspaper to Lu Qixin, the Central News Agency correspondent stationed in Washington.

The Long Distance Division of the Telecommunications Bureau tested the calls for four consecutive nights in preparation for yesterday's return call ceremony. Division Chief Wu Zhengda, team leader Miss Pu, and six Misses in the switchboard room were all sleepless for four nights.

The wireless telephone originally had two lines, allowing two pairs of people to talk at the same time. Unexpectedly, one line suddenly had a temporary failure yesterday, and only one line was available. Therefore, inquiries about telephone calls after 10:00 PM yesterday came one after another, and the Misses at the registration desk were too busy to respond.

The wireless telephone transmitter is located in Zhenru, the receiver is located in Liuhang, and the terminal and long-distance station are located in the Hengbang Bridge Telecommunications Bureau. Therefore, one call to the United States has to go through dozens of connections, and dozens of service personnel are involved.

The charge for a three-minute call is US$12, which, converted at the official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan, is only 140,000 legal currency, which is cheaper than a telegram. However, the Telecommunications Bureau is suffering heavy losses.

If the sunspots do not disappear, a maximum of ten or so calls can be made each day. According to the contract, incoming and outgoing calls must be used alternately by both China and the United States (i.e., ten calls per day, five of which are from China to the United States, and the remaining five are from the United States to China). According to the current registered users, it is "fully booked for three days."

### A World as One Family · Friendly Exchange: Sino-U.S. Wireless Telephone Service Restored; Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Holds Grand Ceremony

[Our Newspaper's Report] Sino-U.S. wireless telephone service was restored and officially opened at 10:00 PM yesterday. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau held a restoration ceremony in the conference room on the second floor of the bureau on Sichuan North Road. Mayor Wu, San Francisco Mayor Lapham, and our Ambassador to the U.S., Gu Weijun, held the first conversation. Yu Bingjian, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, and Wu Zhengda, Er Baiyu, and other senior staff were fully mobilized. From around 9:00 AM, guests from all walks of life arrived at the bureau one after another. Those present included Mayor Wu and his wife, Zhang Bide, Director of the Liaison Section of the Municipal Government, Fulmai of China Electric Company, Ashap of the Telephone Company, Weikesen, Wei Jingmeng, and over 50 reporters from various newspapers. The venue was decorated with Chinese and American flags, and in the center was a large silver inscription that read, "Commemorating the Restoration of Sino-U.S. Wireless Telephone Service." A special correspondent from the Central Film Studio was also present to film the news, and the mercury lamps illuminated the venue as bright as day. At 9:57 AM, Mayor Wu and his wife walked into the conference room and were seated by Director Yu and Engineer Zong Zhifa, marking the beginning of the restoration ceremony. Ladies reported the program in Chinese and English in turn. First, Director Yu reported on the process of restoring the service. He briefly stated: "The Sino-U.S. international wireless telephone service began in March of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], with trial calls between Shanghai and San Francisco, USA. In May of the same year, the service was officially opened. However, due to the outbreak of the 'August 13th' incident, it was suspended. After the victory [of the war], due to international circumstances, in February of this year, our bureau, together with the International Radio Station, began preparations for the service. In addition to the original international telecommunications staff, we recruited and trained international telephone operators and installed an international long-distance switchboard. At the same time, the International Radio Station began installing the dual-channel single-sideband wireless telephone manufactured by Western Electric Company. The work was completed and trial calls were made in May of this year. The original trial call time was scheduled from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM and from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM. However, after two months of trial calls, we found that the change in the Heaviside layer during the daytime was very large, not as clear and good as at night. After discussion, it was decided to officially open the evening calls between Shanghai, Nanjing, and various parts of the United States starting from today (summer time is from 9:00 PM to 1:00 AM)."

After Mr. Yu finished his speech, the "Hello Shanghai" call from San Francisco came from the loudspeaker in the left corner of the venue, which was exceptionally clear.

San Francisco Mayor Lapham

The Two Mayors of China and the United States Communicate First

Emphasizing That the World Is Indivisible. At 10:10 PM, Mayor Wu began to talk with San Francisco Mayor Lapham. Mr. Wu asked first: "I am Mayor Wu, I want to talk to the Mayor of San Francisco." The voice of an American female operator came from the amplifier: "He is here." Then Lapham's heavy and nasal "Hello" sound was heard. Mayor Wu smiled and said: "Is this Mayor Lapham? How are you? How is the weather?" Lapham replied: "Very good." Mayor Wu then read a congratulatory message, saying: "Mayor Lapham, I am very honored to be able to talk to you at the time of the restoration of Sino-U.S. telephone service. I hereby extend my congratulations to you and the citizens of San Francisco on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai. A week ago, I met and talked with you in Shanghai. Within a few days, you have flown back to the United States across half the world. This is the progress of science! You can travel around the world in a few days, and complete the wireless telephone connection between Shanghai and San Francisco in a few minutes. Credibility and friendship are built on mutual understanding. Sino-U.S. friendship has always been very strong. Since the sailing ship era, the United States has had friendly exchanges with China. Even when transportation was very slow, and it took months or even years to travel from the New World to the East, the United States showed sincere concern for China. Now, rapid transportation and convenient transportation will further enhance this concern and mutual understanding between the people of the two countries. What is more, the world is indivisible. The problem of any country is also the problem of other countries. The suffering of any country will immediately affect other countries, and the peace and order of any place can be shared by other places. The Sino-U.S. relationship is very close. In the solution between us on the Pacific, we must obtain help from the other side of the Pacific. The opening of the Sino-U.S. wireless telephone tonight can be said to have entered a new stage in Sino-U.S. friendship and cooperation. This is another tool that can make friendship strong and cooperation effective, can make communication and message transmission fast, thus increasing understanding, and the world is like one family. We will connect Shanghai and San Francisco like a big city, stretching from one shore of the Pacific to the other." After Mayor Wu finished reading, Lapham told him: "Very clear." Then Lapham also delivered a eulogy to Sino-U.S. friendship. At that time, it was about 4:00 AM in San Francisco, so Mayor Wu wished Lapham "Good morning," and Lapham wished Wu "Good evening." They said goodbye to each other in laughter.

Mayor and Ambassador Express Mutual Greetings

The Friendship Between the Two Countries Is Getting Closer

At 10:23 PM, Mayor Wu continued to talk with Ambassador Gu Weijun in Washington. Gu said: "It's night on your side, but it's early morning here. You have worked hard for the citizens." Wu said: "No, the ambassador is working hard for the country." Mr. Wu then slowly read a speech, briefly saying:

Ambassador Gu: Now we are in Washington and Shanghai, separated by a vast ocean and land. I never thought that we would be able to speak to each other through radio today, as if we were very close. Modern science has shortened the distance of time and space, and simply made us forget the height and distance of the sky and despise the vastness of the universe. At this moment, we seem to be in the same room, having a heart-to-heart talk.

Some people praise the omnipotence of science, and some people curse the evil of science. Today, facing this transmitter and listening to the words of friends from afar, we cannot but pay sincere worship and admiration to science. Perhaps we can say that science itself has no good or evil.

Ambassador Gu: When we are talking about the world through wireless telephone tonight, there must be many Chinese and American people who are talking about the news of the restoration of Sino-U.S. international wireless telephone service after tea and dinner. They may feel that the people of China and the United States have added a way to exchange information from today. The traditional friendship between China and the United States has added another layer of connection.

That's right. After the restoration of Sino-U.S. international radio telephone service, it not only reduces the gap between the people of the two countries and increases friendship with each other. There are also overseas Chinese in the United States, who are very concerned about their motherland, and the motherland also misses them. Now, with the wireless telephone, they can express their condolences to each other.

The world is originally one family, and in the new world after the war, we have no need to deny this fact. There is no doubt that this new type of telecommunications equipment will promote the friendship and cooperation between the two countries and move forward. Finally, I hope that Ambassador Gu will often bring good news from Washington to us, and please tell the American people and overseas Chinese in the United States to talk to us more often. I wish Ambassador Gu good health.

After reading, the Ambassador expressed his great pleasure at the clarity of the wireless telephone and asked Mayor Wu to convey his regards to President Chiang and Vice President Sun, and asked about the situation in Shanghai. Mayor Wu told him that Shanghai was very stable, and asked when the Ambassador could return home for a visit. The Ambassador replied that he would not be able to return home for a short rest until his work was over. The conversation ended at 10:30 PM.

Next, Director Yu and Zong, the managing engineer of the International Radio Station, spoke to Thomson, the representative of the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, respectively. Finally, a film about the business of the Telecommunications Bureau was shown, and the Telecommunications Bureau also entertained the guests with refreshments. The restoration ceremony ended late at night. (The conversation between our newspaper and the United States is published on page 2)

The new names and captain candidates of each ship have not yet been determined.

It is also learned that the second batch of 32 warships compensated by Japan to China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, of which our country will receive eight, will be shipped to China before the end of this month, and the third batch of 18 vessels, of which our country will receive seven.

According to the measures proposed by the Ministry of Finance, pre-war deposits refer to those deposited before July 1937 that have not been withdrawn due to the outbreak of the war. As the prices were stable and the interest rates were uniform at that time, the interest for that period will still be calculated on a monthly basis using compound interest at the original interest rate at that time. Wartime deposits refer to deposits made from July 1937 to August 1945 that have not been withdrawn when the area was occupied. The average interest rate of major cities will be used to determine the standard annual interest rate for the years 1937 to 1945, and then calculated on a monthly basis using compound interest (the compound interest of ordinary bank deposits is calculated every six months), with the highest multiplier being 678 times. The small review committee of the former Economic Commission supplemented two points: 1. It is still too low to repay at a maximum of 678 times, and it is planned to find ways to increase the multiplier (some committee members advocated 700 times). 2. The Four Banks Joint Office should conduct a detailed survey of the total amount of such deposits in all state-owned banks, commercial banks, and to inform and calculate before re-approving its repayment method. A concrete decision may be made at this general meeting. (3) The issue of selling state-owned enterprises, the organization of the supervisory committee will be discussed and expanded. (4) Other urgent economic issues.

### News Magazine Registration Cancellation Co-review Method

Handled Solely by the Ministry of Interior

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] An official from the Ministry of Interior stated that "Regarding the registration and issuance of licenses for news magazines nationwide, the Ministry, and the provincial, municipal, and county governments have always followed Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, and other articles of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Publication Law, and jointly reviewed with the Central Propaganda Department and their respective party departments at the same level. Now, as we prepare for the constitutional period, the current co-review system is no longer necessary.

### The Communist Army in Henan Violates Its Promise and Destroys the River Restoration Work; Forcibly Crosses the River and Occupies Dongkou

The defending army did not fight back because military operations were suspended during the construction period. Dongkou was then occupied by the Communist army. Liu Bocheng arrived at Qingzuji in Bandongming Village on the opposite bank yesterday to direct acts of hindering the river restoration and destroying the dikes. His breach of promise, the sudden crossing of the river and invasion in the area where military operations were suspended, and disregard for the lives of tens of millions of people are infuriating.

### Guidelines for the Reorganization of Local Security Forces in Northern Jiangsu Have Been Established; Approved by the Army Headquarters for Implementation

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 1st] The local security and self-defense forces in the counties of northern Jiangsu are in a chaotic state, with uneven quality and lax discipline.

Questions and Answers Between This Newspaper's Reporter and Mr. Decker

Incoming Call

The call from the United States was connected at 11 p.m. It was Mr. Decker (Jack Tncder), an editor at the New York American Daily, calling Mr. Wu Jiahui, the chief of the interviewing department of this newspaper. Mr. Wu received a notice from the Telecommunications Bureau the night before, saying that a Mr. Decker would be calling him. Sure enough, the call came through on time yesterday.

It turned out that Mr. Decker did not know Mr. Wu, but only saw the telegraphic dispatches he sent out in foreign newspapers. So, before the call, he first asked if he could speak English.

Then, the first question Mr. Decker asked him was, "What is the black market price of US dollars in Shanghai?" When Mr. Wu told him that this was a serious violation of the law and he could not reveal it, Mr. Decker couldn't help but laugh. The following is their conversation:

Decker: "How many American soldiers are still in Shanghai?"

Wu: "Very few, about two hundred or so."

Decker: "How is their behavior?"

Wu: "Very good."

Decker: "Are there any Japanese soldiers left?"

Wu: "Almost all have returned, only a few technical personnel remain."

Decker: "What is the biggest news published in Shanghai newspapers today?"

Wu: "The joint meeting of the Central Political Committee and the Central Standing Committee decided to strengthen the suppression of the Communist military."

Decker: "How is the climate in Shanghai?"

Wu: "The highest is 82.3 degrees."

Later, when Mr. Wu asked him what the climate was like in New York today, Mr. Decker replied that it was 80 degrees.

At this time, the operator reported that the call time was up, and the conversation ended.

Questions and Answers Between Lu Qixin and This Newspaper's Reporter

Outgoing Call

The call between this newspaper and Lu Qixin, a special correspondent of the Central News Agency in Washington, D.C., was connected at 12:17 a.m. this morning. It was also the first telephone call from China to the United States. When the reporter talked to Mr. Lu, who was 7,509 miles away, in the editor-in-chief's office, the voice was clear and distinct, giving the feeling of a face-to-face conversation in the same room. The conversation lasted eleven minutes before ending. When Mr. Lu was talking to the reporter, he was in the Washington, D.C. office of the Central News Agency. It was noon, the sun was shining brightly, and the heat was oppressive, with the thermometer reading 90 degrees.

In the phone call, Mr. Lu first expressed his greetings to Mr. Chen Xun, the editor-in-chief of this newspaper, and his colleagues. Then, the conversation officially began. The reporter first asked about the U.S. reaction to the decision made at the joint meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee to strengthen the suppression of the Communist military. Mr. Lu said, "All the major American newspapers published it in large font today, but there was no reaction." The reporter also asked, "What is the general view of the American people on the China issue?" Mr. Lu said, "After the American press giants returned from their trip around the world on Pan American planes, they made many speeches on the China issue, so the American people have become interested in the Far East and the China issue again. For example, the opinion of Mr. White, the publisher of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, is that the United States must choose strategically important and capable of revitalizing countries to support between communism and democracy; he believes that the United States can make efforts in China, Japan, and the Philippines. He said that China is the most dangerous place in the Far East.

Mr. Kennan, the editor-in-chief of the Christian Science Monitor, said: Both India and China are facing very serious crises of collapse. The Chinese National Government is encountering serious difficulties. However, there is no inevitable reason for China to collapse. If the spirit of the Kuomintang's revolution in the past can be used to replace the selfishness and corruption of today's government officials, then many current difficulties can be solved easily.

Finally, Mr. Lu added, "This morning, Ambassador Wei Daoming talked to Mayor O'Dwyer and then told him that this Sino-American wireless telephone call is a restart of the frequent communication network of the past, and from now on, it can also establish a post-war international communication mechanism. China and the United States are located on the east and west coasts of the Pacific Ocean, and have common and mutually beneficial goals in establishing world peace and striving for international stability. At the same time, China and the United States also have the same goal of revitalizing commerce and seeking prosperity for the people. Therefore, one of the most important points of today's call is that it can enhance the understanding between the people of the two countries."

Mr. Lu Qixin, Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency in Washington, D.C.

She greeted the reporter of this newspaper, saying, "Hello! Sir, how are you?" The reporter hurriedly asked who the other party was. She replied, "I am Tao Luosai!" The voice was very kind, as if she was blaming him for not recognizing her voice. At that time, the telecommunications bureau had also discovered the wrong connection and immediately hung up. Because of these setbacks, the call to Vandenberg was never connected.

Editorial

### The Japanese Textile Industry Should Not Be Expanded!

The China Textile Institute believes that MacArthur is biased towards the Japanese textile industry, not allowing it to be included in the list of reparations and relocation, and there is also talk of expanding Japanese spindles to 6 million to compete for the international trade market. After the members' congress, the Institute submitted a letter of protest to MacArthur, which was originally published in this newspaper on June 29. This protest letter was directly pointed out to MacArthur by Chinese industrial academic groups and does not represent the government's opinion. It is purely the awareness of the Chinese people and can be said to be the reaction of the Chinese light industry academic community to MacArthur's policy of controlling Japan. Whether this reaction is "strong" or "weak" depends on MacArthur's response. It is still too early to make a judgment. However, public opinion cannot remain silent on this major event that concerns the future of China's textile industry.

Japan is a country that has leaped from light industry to heavy industry. The concentration of capital and the monopoly of operations have led to the seizure of raw materials and markets by force, and the result was the outbreak of a war of aggression. The Potsdam Declaration stipulates: "Japan shall use factory equipment as compensation, and its retained industry shall be limited to maintaining its normal economic life." The spirit of this provision is to limit Japan's industry and thereby control Japan's economic development through compensation, which is quite far-sighted. It has been two years since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration. The issue of compensation is still pending, and each country has its own plan, and opinions have not converged. The most noteworthy and well-known are the report of Mr. Pauley, the U.S. President's Special Envoy for Compensation, and the report of Mr. Strike, the U.S. Military Department's Compensation Commissioner. Regarding the retention of the Japanese textile industry, Pauley advocated maintaining 3 million spindles, which the Japanese also said was not harsh; Strike's plan showed a slightly more lenient attitude and suggested: "Japan has lost Manchuria, Taiwan, and Korea after the war, and has paid a heavy price. The level of Japanese industry and the retained factory equipment should be improved." Based on this, the Far Eastern Commission passed a decision in April of this year to maintain Japan's industrial level from 1930 to 1934. 1930 was the year of Japan's capitalist leap, and the "September 18th Incident" occurred the following year; 1933 was the year Japan replaced Britain as the world's number one textile industry country, and the rapid advancement of industry and trade in 1934 marked the transition from the era of textile industry as the center to the era of heavy industries such as metal machinery and chemical products as the center.

China expressed great regret over the decision of the Far Eastern Commission, and those in the know believed that the United States had armed Japan and expressed protests in public opinion. As the saying goes, "Treading on frost indicates that strong ice is coming." Since the Far Eastern Commission has started the trend, MacArthur has created its system. In addition to allowing Japan to resume industrial and trade activities, it has recently allowed whaling in Antarctica and phosphorus mining in Palau. It is expected that before the San Francisco Peace Treaty is convened, Japan's economic development may become a grand sight. As for the retention of Japanese spindles, according to Pauley's investigation, Japan currently has 2,718,000 spindles after the war, and in the future, maintaining a maximum of 3 million spindles will be enough. However, MacArthur believes that the Japanese textile industry is not comparable to the military industry and plans to expand it to 6 million spindles. In addition to 1.5 million spindles producing to meet the needs of the Japanese people, the surplus production will be exported to revitalize Japanese trade. This news has not been fully confirmed. If it does become a reality, the textile industries of China, Britain, India, and Australia will once again face a strong enemy, and the future is worrying. It is hoped that the clear-minded MacArthur will not fall into this error and shake the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration!

In fact, the Japanese textile industry, if developed peacefully, does not need to be based on a huge number of spindles. Measuring Japanese industrial equipment from an American industrial perspective is a mistake. First, according to the calculation of the China Textile Institute: Japan has a population of 70 million, and based on 20 yards of cotton cloth per person per year, a maximum of 1.3 million spindles are more than enough, and there is no need to maintain more than 3 million spindles; second, due to the lack of cotton raw materials, most of the 2.7 million spindles in Japan after the war have not been put into operation. According to the report obtained by China National Construction Corporation, Japan has now reduced from 2.5 million spindles to 2.1 million spindles, and may be reduced to 1.9 million spindles. If it forcibly wants to expand production, it will inevitably covet cotton raw materials in North China and India and Australia, and future disputes will undoubtedly evolve into international disasters; third, Japan is making multifaceted efforts to rebuild after the war, and there is a shortage of skilled workers. During the war, many textile machines were converted to heavy industry to produce military supplies, and it is not easy to refit them. If the number of spindles is expanded to 6 million, Japan will inevitably demand loans and technical and machinery assistance from the United States. Can today's American policy help the development of defeated countries and sit idly by as the allied countries lose their opportunities for recovery? Fourth, China's textile production cannot compete with Japan's and needs to maintain a balanced development relationship with Japan. Japanese spindles can rotate 10,000 times per minute, while China can only rotate 6,000 to 7,000 times; Japan works 24 hours a day, now it is 16 hours, and the intensity of its labor is beyond the reach of Lancashire. If 6 million spindles are operating under excellent management and technology, no textile industry in the world dares to compete with it. Therefore, the redevelopment of the Japanese textile industry is a threat to world peace. This is what is making China, Britain, Australia, and other countries uneasy.

The above arguments show that Japan's existing spindles have reached the saturation point and do not need a large number. If the world situation is not considered and it is suddenly allowed to expand excessively, the turmoil in the Far East will be repeated, and world peace will be threatened. We do not want to make emotional criticisms of the United States' policy of controlling Japan, but we want to declare that the so-called industrial level is relative. Americans cannot look at Japan from an American standard, and should not measure everything by the pre-war level. The economies of various countries after the war have rarely returned to pre-war levels, and it is even more difficult to meet American standards. This is a fact. It is hoped that the American government and the public will face this fact squarely. If the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo is slightly negligent and approves Japan's expansion of spindles to 6 million in one breath, it will more or less disregard the life and death of the Allied countries and force the Far Eastern countries to live in constant anxiety, which is indeed a cause for concern. The protest letter from the China Textile Institute is a cry under this kind of anxiety, and it is a resonance of the voices of Britain, Australia, and other countries. It is a kind of friendly hope for MacArthur, and it is not exaggerated in terms of fact and reason. It is hoped that MacArthur will make a wise choice and use facts to comfort the people of the Allied countries! At the same time, we must point out that the San Francisco Peace Treaty should be convened as soon as possible to reasonably resolve these pending issues. China and Japan should quickly establish peaceful economic relations, and establish agreements on the possible conflicts in production between the two countries, so as to restore normal trade and establish peaceful production relations. This is the hope for the future of China and Japan.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Seems to Have a Turning Point After Almost Being Killed: Bidault's New Proposal, Whose Content Is Slightly Closer to the Soviet Proposal: A Final Attempt Will Be Made at Today's Continued Meeting

[This Newspaper] Paris Broadcast: The third meeting of the three foreign ministers today, that is, the last meeting, is about to be held. The split between the British and Soviet groups is almost unavoidable because the opinions of the British and Soviets on the implementation of the Marshall Plan are extremely different. The meeting place is still the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Bevin arrived first, with a beaming smile. A minute later, Molotov also arrived, very serious. Molotov originally had seven advisors accompanying him, but today there were only three. News also said: The Foreign Ministers' Conference ended after discussing it for an hour and forty minutes today. Molotov walked out of the French Foreign Ministry. Judging from the situation, the meeting was almost a complete failure. Bevin also left the venue nine minutes after Molotov walked out of the venue. When reporters asked if the meeting was over, Bevin replied, "Not yet." According to official news, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will still be held tomorrow.

News also said: At today's Foreign Ministers' Conference, Bidault had a new proposal. According to Molotov, this new proposal has nothing special, but he is willing to consider it.

[This Newspaper] Paris Broadcast, 1st: The Foreign Ministers' Conference was saved from breaking down today because of the French compromise plan. The French Foreign Minister's compromise plan has two points that are different from before. (1) In some respects, it is similar to Molotov's proposal yesterday. (2) The investigation of European production will never interfere in the internal affairs of member states or infringe on their sovereignty.

[Reuters Paris 30th Dispatch] Bidault and Molotov held their third meeting this afternoon, which lasted for three hours. According to reliable sources, the Three Powers Conference is expected to end on Tuesday without reaching an agreement. Reliable sources said: At today's meeting, Bevin gave a summary of the suggestions of various agencies implementing the Marshall Plan, and Molotov also put forward counter-suggestions, the content of which was not much different from Molotov's opinions put forward at the previous meeting. The three foreign ministers will continue to meet on Tuesday, at which time Molotov may make another statement, but the general public feels tonight that the meeting has actually ended. At present, the three foreign ministers no longer have the opportunity to agree on a common economic plan. Bevin's plan outlined today stipulates the establishment of an integrated committee to draft a European recovery plan for the next four years. In addition, it also advocates the establishment of four special committees to study coal, steel, grain, and vocational issues, and submit reports before August 15. All European countries except Spain will be asked for their opinions. However, the number of members of each committee will be limited. For example, the members of the integrated committee will be composed of the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and at most four other countries.

[Agence France-Presse Paris 30th Dispatch] Qualified observers here recently said that after British Foreign Secretary Bevin clarified the United Kingdom's views on the Marshall Plan for economic assistance to Europe today, the positions of Britain and France have become more similar, but Austria and the Soviet Union are far apart. Foreign Secretary Bevin and Foreign Minister Bidault both emphasized that European countries must cooperate in drafting this recovery plan, otherwise it will be difficult to obtain practical assistance from the US government or Congress. However, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov strongly stated that there is no need for such measures, and it is enough to set up an intelligence agency to collect information on the needs of various European countries. He also said that the Soviet government does not object to the establishment of a central agency to form a technical committee to be responsible for investigating the needs of various European countries as the basis for the assistance plan, but it must not go beyond the scope of this task, because the main purpose is only to request assistance and obtain US dollars, so there is no need to draft a similar pan-European plan. Foreign Secretary Bevin believes that Molotov's suggestion is tantamount to asking the United States for a ""blank check"", and the result will undoubtedly be rejected.

### If the Soviet Union Refuses to Participate in European Reconstruction, the United States Will Not Change Its Plan: Future Progress Will Be Made by Britain and France Alone

[United Press International Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Marshall has received a formal report on the Paris European Recovery Conference, which stated that the Soviet Union may withdraw from the conference, but Marshal has not commented on this. It is also learned that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan does not seem to cause any major changes in the US government.

[United Press International Paris, 1st] The Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is likely to end in complete failure. In view of the fact that Europe will inevitably be divided into two economic groups, the Soviet-controlled and Western European, Britain and France are now stepping up contact with various Western European countries to prepare the Marshall Plan. Britain and France may come forward to invite all countries willing to participate in the Marshall Plan. According to diplomatic sources, Britain and France will set September 1 as the deadline for submitting the entire plan to the United States. The so-called Western European group suggested by diplomatic circles should include the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Sweden, Italy, and western Germany. Whether the Nordic countries will join the Western European group is uncertain due to their close ties with the Soviet Union in terms of geography and economy. Whether Portugal will participate is also uncertain. As for Spain, France has excluded it. And Poland and Yugoslavia believe that when the Soviet Union refuses to participate, they will also withdraw their request to participate.

### British Ambassador to the United States: No Comment on the Foreign Ministers' Conference

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 30th] British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel, met with US Secretary of State Marshall this morning to discuss the progress of the Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. He told the press afterwards: We are pessimistic about the progress of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is said that I discussed the entire situation with Secretary of State Marshall. It is better for us to mention the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference less. I am scheduled to leave here on July 2 and return to London, where I will stay for a few weeks and will ask the government authorities for instructions. According to the authorities here, the British Ambassador to the United States is constantly informing the US government of the developments of the Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. The US has not sent formal observers to attend this conference.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Cancels News Blackout Measures

[United Press International Paris, 30th] The Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference has only now lifted the veil of secrecy since it began last Friday. This is because the Soviet TASS news agency has violated the secrecy agreement twice, so it was decided to cancel it.

### US Foreign Aid Is Not Limited to Europe

Commerce Secretary Harriman Tells Reporters

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 30th] Commerce Secretary Harriman recently told the press: The world today needs US assistance, and it is not limited to Europe. The United States has responsibilities to Japan, Korea, and other countries. We should consider the money and materials needed for European reconstruction with a sympathetic attitude. Only Congress can decide whether to give them. The National Advisory Committee headed by Treasury Secretary Snyder has no different opinions on Secretary of State Marshall's plan to aid Europe. Harriman will visit Germany with Secretary of Agriculture Anderson and return to the United States around mid-July.

### US Treasury Surplus of $750 Million

[United Press International Washington, 30th] The US government today announced the national treasury situation, with revenues of $42.25 billion and expenditures of $41.75 billion, resulting in a surplus of $750 million. This is the first surplus in 17 years.

### Soviet Opposition to Anglo-French Proposals, Saying They May Interfere in Internal Affairs of Small Countries, Advocates Setting Up an Assistance Committee to Seek American Aid

[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] TASS today accused Britain and France of attempting to control other European countries through the composite committee proposed by Bevin and Bidault. Britain and France want to use this implementing body for the Marshall Plan to make the economies of European countries suitable for the needs of Britain and France and the requirements put forward by the United States. TASS said that the Soviet Union's plan would not allow strong countries the possibility of interfering in the internal affairs of small countries. The proposals of Bevin and Bidault are intended to make small countries bear the cost of solving the economic difficulties of Britain and France themselves. American loans will be used as bait to coerce small countries. In this regard, the policies of Britain and France are similar to those of the United States. Recently, some people have strongly stated that the pan-European economic plan proposed by Britain and France does not interfere in the affairs of small countries and will not affect their sovereignty, but the facts show the opposite of these statements.

The recent agreement between Greece and the United States has been published. The first sentence of the agreement includes phrases such as acknowledging Greek sovereignty as examples, but after the agreement was established, Greece's sovereignty was violated. Another example is the US loan to Austria, which made Austria a vassal of the US supervisors. All of this is sufficient to explain why the Soviet delegation did not approve of the proposals made by Britain and France regarding the implementation of the Marshall Plan. Bevin's proposal is similar to France's plan, emphasizing the establishment of a composite committee to draft a European reconstruction plan for the next four years and to harmonize the needs of European countries. At the same time, it is proposed that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union initiate the drafting of a large-scale economic plan for the whole of Europe, which will then be submitted to the United States for consideration. The meaning of this move is certainly not to place the economies of Britain and France under the control of other European countries. Its intention is obviously to adjust the economies of other European countries through the composite committee to make them suitable for the needs of Britain and France themselves and the requirements put forward by the United States. The Soviet Union's proposal is to establish an assistance committee composed of the three powers and several other small countries to investigate the needs of European countries and help them obtain American aid. This plan eliminates the possibility of strong countries interfering in the internal affairs of small countries.

### British Imperial Conference to Discuss Military Equipment to Convene Next Monday in London

[Reuters, London, 30th] Representatives of the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and Southern Rhodesia are scheduled to hold a meeting in London from July 7th to 26th to discuss the issue of military equipment. A similar conference was held once after the war, based on wartime experience, to discuss improvements in equipment, clothing, and so on, to suit climatic and strategic needs. The theme of this discussion will be to increase the establishment of tropical and cold-region test stations in various parts of the Empire. There is already a tropical tactical test station in Lagos, West Africa, and an Arctic tactical test station in Churchill, Canada. This meeting will not be open to the public.

### On the Issue of International Military Strength, I Agree with the British Proposal, Soviet Representative Opposes Immediately Proposing Definite Figures

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] Regarding the estimation of the strength of international armed forces, the figures presented by the five powers to the United Nations Security Council are different. The Chinese representative did not present a figure, but said that in principle, he agreed with the British proposal. The Soviet representative said that due to the urgency of time, he was unable to present a figure.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] The United Nations Security Council met today to discuss the issue of the strength of international armed forces. Soviet representative Gromyko vehemently attacked the US proposal advocating 20 army divisions and 4,000 aircraft, saying that this important issue could not be decided in three or four hours of discussion, and therefore, he proposed that the United Nations Military Staff Committee formally submit recommendations. The strength proposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is listed as follows: (A) French proposal for the strength of the international fleet includes the following forces: (1) Air Force - 775 bombers, 300 fighters, 200 reconnaissance aircraft; (2) Army - 6 divisions, of which 3 divisions are armored vehicle units, 3 divisions are parachute units, and 10 divisions are motorized units or cavalry; (3) Navy - 9 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 9 cruisers, 18 to 24 destroyers, 30 escort ships, 30 minesweepers, 12 submarines. (B) The British plan includes the following forces: (1) Air Force - 600 bombers, 400 fighters, 200 other aircraft; (2) Army - 8 to 12 divisions; (3) Navy - 2 battleships, 4 aircraft carriers, 6 cruisers, 24 destroyers, 48 escort ships, 24 minesweepers, 12 submarines. (C) The US proposal includes the following figures: (1) Air Force - 1,250 bombers, 2,250 fighters, 400 other aircraft; (2) Army - 20 divisions; (3) Navy - 3 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 15 cruisers, 84 destroyers.

### Japanese New Diet Reconvenes Yesterday, Katayama Requests Early Treaty Conclusion and Hopes for Economic Assistance from Allied Nations

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] Prime Minister Katayama addressed the House of Representatives on the morning of the 1st, requesting an early signing of the peace treaty with Japan, and said that Japan does not need territory, but needs the spirit and economic assistance of the Allied nations to revitalize Japan. The Japanese people have been demilitarized and are victoriously heading towards the road of civil life. The Japanese people hope that Japan will join the United Nations as soon as possible and devote itself to the permanent peace of the world. Katayama believes that the decision of the Allied Headquarters to reopen Japan's international private trade will help Japan's recovery and expresses his pleasure. He also said that Japan is currently facing extreme economic difficulties due to the lack of raw materials and the damage to industrial equipment. The entire Japanese nation must endure hardships and sacrifices to overcome the difficulties. Most of Katayama's speech elaborated on the difficult economic situation in Japan, so he asked the whole country to support the government's economic measures. Katayama did not mention the issue of reparations, nor did he talk about the occupation issue after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. In the past, whenever the Diet opened, the Japanese Prime Minister would first give a political speech in the House of Peers and then deliver a speech in the Lower House, but this time Katayama exceptionally delivered his speech in the House of Representatives first and is scheduled to deliver the same speech in the House of Councillors in the afternoon of the 1st.

### Turkey Purchases Ships from the US

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] The State Department announced last night that the Turkish government has requested the United States to sell ten merchant ships to Turkey.

### Push-Button Warfare Is Not Yet Possible

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The House Appropriations Committee is currently discussing the legislation to merge the three services of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford, a naval aviation expert who served as commander of the Pacific Fleet, and Rear Admiral Parsons, an atomic energy expert, opposed the independence of the Air Force as a separate department when they testified before the committee on the 30th. Radford told the committee that the notion that the United States could be destroyed by a group of atomic bombs in a matter of hours or days is "absolutely impossible." Radford and Parsons also said that "push-button" warfare would not occur for at least five to twenty years. Once war breaks out, the carriers of airborne atomic bombs would be heavy bombers and high-speed jet aircraft.

### Wada Announces Economic Policy

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Japanese Economic Stabilization Board Director-General Wada Hiroo presented a report to the Japanese Diet this afternoon, outlining the most concrete economic policy for revitalizing Japan, stating that increasing industrial production, reforming the system of production and distribution, and expanding Japan's foreign trade are the only ways to solve the country's declining economy. Wada pleaded with the Japanese people to tighten their belts and increase exports. He solemnly stated that the Japanese economy needs to increase the production of coal and other materials that can be exported. He said that the Japanese government hopes to control the distribution of raw materials and hopes that coal production will reach 30 million tons and steel production will reach 700,000 tons this year. The Japanese government expects that cotton yarn exports in 1947 will be twice as much as in previous years. He denounced the flow of important materials into the black market and allowed raw materials to be controlled and distributed on a priority basis. He believes that the current economic crisis in Japan is caused by the following reasons: (1) a severe shortage of production, (2) urgent needs of Japanese consumers since the end of the war, (3) malignant inflation.

### Government Submits Written Responses to Questions on Food

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Ichiki Otsuhiko, a member of the Japanese House of Councillors, submitted seven written questions to the government regarding the production costs of rice and wheat and the smuggling of staple and non-staple foods. The government also responded in writing, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Raising the purchase price of food will increase the burden on consumers, so the purchase price cannot be determined based solely on the producer's point of view. (2) Regarding the main agricultural products such as rice and wheat, production plans should be formulated under the organic linkage of production planning, purchase ratio, and allocation ratio of production materials such as fertilizers. Legislation regarding this issue is currently under study. (3) Regarding the elimination of secret purchases, the entire nation should make efforts, but it is a prerequisite that the people can obtain the minimum amount of food, so efforts must be made to increase food production.

### North Korean Conference Continues

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 1st] The North Korean conference continued this afternoon at 2:00 pm at the meeting of the People's Committee in Pyongyang. US and Soviet representatives and North Korean People's Committee leaders Kim Il-sung, Kim Tu-bong, Kim Chae-geun, and Hong Ki-ju were present. The meeting was chaired by Major General Brown, and Soviet representative Lieutenant General Butikov delivered a speech, followed by Major General Brown, who explained the procedures of the meeting.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 1st] Various groups under the North Korean professional organizations sent letters of appreciation to the US-Soviet Joint Committee through the Cultural Department of the People's Committee and unanimously recommended Kim Il-sung as the leader of the future Korean provisional government. Also, North Korean farmers competed to present gifts to the US and Soviet representatives, including silk fabrics, summer cloth, etc.

### Montgomery Arrives in Australia, He Does Not Believe There Will Be Another Major War

[United Press, Canberra, 1st] British Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery arrived in Darwin yesterday and delivered a speech, saying that he had already "tasted enough of the bitterness of war" and did not believe that there would be another major war.

The purpose of Montgomery's visit to Australia is to discuss the defense issues of the Empire in the Pacific.

### MacArthur's Lenient Policy Towards Japan Causes Deep Dissatisfaction in Britain, Believes MacArthur's Reform Plan Is Too Conservative

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated that Britain is dissatisfied with some aspects of the US policy towards Japan, exacerbating the long-brewing conflict between MacArthur and other occupying countries. Official opinions cannot be ascertained at this time, but the disputes in the past few months can be briefly described as follows: (1) According to representatives of some countries, MacArthur is nominally the commander of the United Nations, but he is too independent, giving the US occupation forces a superior position and reducing foreign participation; (2) Spokesmen for Britain and the Soviet Union have repeatedly criticized MacArthur's reform plan as incomplete, too conservative, and too lenient towards some Japanese; (3) China, Britain, Australia, and other countries all said that MacArthur wanted to reduce reparations and allow Japan to maintain a higher level of industrial development. British officials in Malaya, in need of Japanese prisoners of war to restore wartime damage, opposed MacArthur's repatriation plan.

### MacArthur Retorts, Hailing the Achievements of the Occupation

On the other hand, MacArthur has also clearly expressed impatience with international hesitation, saying that the US's dominant occupation has prevented Japan from becoming as disorganized as Germany and has curbed the communist offensive. The United States has spent money to maintain the Japanese economy, while other countries are reluctant to contribute and yet want to speak on Japanese affairs. Speed is of the essence, especially in the economy. MacArthur has repeatedly urged the Far Eastern Commission to resolve the issue of Japanese reparations and to re-determine the level of the Japanese economy, but it should be guaranteed that the Japanese can obtain sufficient food and other necessities. MacArthur's decision to allow the Japanese to hunt whales for the second time and to mine phosphate ore from Angaur Island was based on this consideration. Otherwise, the United States would have to spend more money on imports or cause internal unrest, endangering the occupation forces. Japan currently owes the United States about $300 million, and the import of necessities is rapidly increasing.

### Various Countries Express Particular Doubt About the Degree of Japanese Democracy

MacArthur and his spokesmen have repeatedly stated that democracy will remain in Japan, but many foreign representatives and some more impartial observers do not believe so. However, MacArthur said that the occupation forces can only order some reforms, and the rest should be carried out automatically by the Japanese. In this regard, the mission of the occupation forces has actually been completed. MacArthur advocates a moderate political and economic philosophy, which is more conservative than what the Soviet Union, Britain, and Australia hope for. The spokesmen of the three countries have repeatedly stated this.

### Allied Headquarters Issues Statement Responding to British Protest

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st] MacArthur's Headquarters issued a special statement today in response to recent protests from Britain and other countries regarding the permission granted to Japan to send whaling fleets to the Antarctic Ocean and to carry out mining operations on Angaur Island, stating that "it is clearly not true to say that this move threatens the economic or military security of any" Allied nation. As for the claim that the British and Australian governments were not consulted in advance, it is also inaccurate. The US government consulted with the relevant governments before MacArthur's Headquarters approved the project.

### Anglo-American Banking Syndicate's Loan to Japan Rejected by Allied Headquarters Because of Excessive Interest Rate

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] This reporter has just learned from the most reliable sources that an Anglo-American banking syndicate had offered a loan of £50 million to Japan, but it was rejected by the Allied Headquarters. This matter was proposed recently, and the Allied Headquarters announced its opposition a few days ago. The reason is that the interest rate is too high and other conditions are harsh. The Anglo-American banking syndicate wanted to obtain an interest rate of 3.5%, and the annual interest rate would be about 4% including other commissions. The Allied Headquarters insisted that the maximum limit should be around 2.8%. The guarantee and collateral for the loan were not discussed. According to reports, the Anglo-American banking syndicate is the most definite of all the loan proposals made by various parties, and the matter of semi-official or private US capital loans of US$1 billion to Japan is currently being discussed in Washington and Tokyo.

### British Government to Introduce Indian Autonomy Bill Soon

Prime Minister Attlee will lead the government side in speaking, and opposition leader Churchill, who has been gradually recovering from surgery, will also attend in person. The main speaker on Indian affairs for the Conservative Party, former Under-Secretary of State for India Butler, will also return from the United States to participate.

### Britain and Egypt Settle Financial Matters, Establish Temporary Agreement

[Agence France-Presse, 30th] After lengthy negotiations between Britain and Egypt regarding the settlement of Britain's gold pound debts to Egypt, it has been learned that the two countries have reached a temporary agreement. Its validity period is until the end of this year. This agreement will enable Egypt to temporarily cope with the current financial situation. Both parties will continue to hold negotiations to establish an agreement with a longer term and including the various issues reserved by both parties. The contents of this temporary agreement are expected to be announced on the 3rd of this month.

### Agreement Reached on Cabinet Formation in Indonesia, It Is Rumored That Sjahrir Will Serve as Prime Minister, US Export-Import Bank Reserves Loan to Indonesia

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 1st] It has been learned that the list of the new cabinet of the Republic of Indonesia may be announced this afternoon, and all political parties have now reached an agreement on this. Former Minister of Defense Sjahrir may serve as Prime Minister, and there may be as many as three Deputy Prime Ministers. Former Prime Minister Sjahrir may be appointed as special envoy to the United Kingdom or the United States.

[United Press, Batavia, 1st] According to sources from the Republic, the new cabinet will respond to the US note tonight, and the new cabinet will be a coalition government. Important positions are allocated to the four major parties, and minor positions are assigned to other parties. At the same time, former Minister of Defense Sjahrir said at a press conference that the Indonesian Republican government is willing to accept a "super-structure," which will create a transitional period until January 9, 1949. Sjahrir stated the goal of the Republican government as stipulated in the Linggadjati Agreement. He explained that the "super-structure" has nothing to do with the Dutch-Indonesian Federation.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] The US Export-Import Bank said today that the bank is still earmarking a US$100 million loan to Indonesia after the situation improves. It is said that this loan was earmarked as early as September 1945, but the situation in Indonesia soon deteriorated, so it was not granted.

### British Newspaper Comments on Indonesian Situation

[Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] Regarding the US note to the Republic of Indonesia, requesting Indonesia to cooperate with the Netherlands to quickly organize a provisional Indonesian government, the Manchester Guardian published an article commenting on this, saying that this move is a last-minute effort to prevent a war between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The current situation is extremely chaotic and dangerous. If Indonesia believes that the Dutch proposal is merely to make them choose between war and unconditional surrender, Indonesia will likely choose the path of war. They know that war will divide the Netherlands no less than it will divide Indonesia. Conversely, if Indonesia believes that accepting the proposal to establish a provisional government does not make it impossible to discuss divergent opinions, their attitude may be slightly compromised.

### Jewish Irgun Group Agrees to Cease Terrorist Actions

### Flooding Causes Disaster, Floods 100,000 Acres of Farmland

### French Interior Minister Announces: Inside Story of the Black Market Party Conspiracy, Two Arrested Leaders Begin Trial

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Key leaders of the "Blue Plan" rebellion conspiracy led by the right-wing French Black Market Party, including the French Gendarmerie Inspector General Jilo and the editor of the French Life Weekly, Furban, began trial here today on charges of undermining national security by recruiting armed forces and assembling criminals for robbery. At the same time, there is a new development in the "Blue Plan" conspiracy. Retired officer Lawo was arrested today on suspicion of participating in the conspiracy. Multiple light machine guns were found in the residence of Father Raulde, who was arrested by the authorities but temporarily released on bail.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Regarding the conspiracy of the French Black Market Party to overthrow the French Republic, after Interior Minister Tapoulou held a meeting with the Prime Minister, he issued a statement to the press, clarifying the conspiracy plan of the Black Market Party. It is said that the Black Market Party had planned to rely on the assistance of the armored forces of the French occupation forces in Germany to seize Paris, overthrow the Republic, and establish a political system in accordance with the Vichy government. The conspirators also planned to issue fabricated communist documents to undermine the position of the Communist Party so that the Black Market Party could appear in the guise of restoring order.

Extremist Right Wing Plots to Overthrow Government

The French government learned of the existence of the Black Market Party as early as 1946. It was formed by extreme right-wing royalists, supporters of the Vichy government, and former collaborators. Its goal was to attack the Republic by force, and then replace it with a temporary political system of an unclear nature. In March of this year, the government learned that the Black Market Party had formulated an attack plan called the "Blue Plan," which would be implemented at the end of July or August 6. The conspirators planned to first raid the Vannes Saint-Fange prison in Brittany to release a former leader of the Black Market Party (who raided the prison for killing a prisoner). After receiving the above information, the police station began an investigation. On the 24th of this month, agents were dispatched to Count Furban's residence to search and found a large number of battle orders, secret instructions, and announcements. Count Furban was also arrested. Because the evidence was conclusive, it was not easy to deny, so he directly admitted the existence of the conspiracy. Count Furban also stated during the trial that the French Gendarmerie Inspector General Jilo was also involved in the conspiracy. The police station then searched Jilo's residence yesterday and arrested him.

Three Instructions to Frame the Communists

The meeting place for the conspirators was in the residence of Mrs. Walfur (wife of the writer Walfur). The conspirators received the following three instructions: (1) Prepare a list of names, send obituaries printed with hammers and sickles to the people on the list, informing them that the Communist Party has sentenced them to death and is about to execute them. (2) Leave fabricated communist secret warnings in public places to agitate public opinion. (3) Incite riots, loot banks and farms, so that public opinion believes that this is the Communist Party's preparation to establish a communist regime by force. The "Blue Plan" conspiracy of the Black Market Party has nothing to do with the People's Unity Movement led by General de Gaulle.

### Laumadi Denies Cabinet Reshuffle in France

[United Press, Paris, 1st] It is rumored here that Prime Minister Laumadi will reshuffle the cabinet to avoid a political storm caused by his resignation. Mr. Xu has denied this today. According to reports, the future of the government depends on the outcome of the National Assembly's vote on the motion of confidence in the government. He is expected to propose this motion tomorrow. On Monday night, news came from the Prime Minister's office that La Ri intends to change several cabinet members to avoid being forced to resign, which contradicts the rumors.

### International Court of Justice Summons Albania

[Reuters, The Hague, 30th] The United Kingdom, based on the resolution of the United Nations Security Council, previously filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice against Albania for the incidents in the Corfu Strait last autumn, which caused two British warships to be damaged by mines. After the International Court summoned Albania to court, Albania's power document will be delivered soon.

### Restrictions on Newsprint Imports, British Newspapers to Reduce Pages

### First Economic Council Meeting, City-Wide Survey of Businesses to Begin Tomorrow, Strict Order to Dismantle Intercom Phones, Violators to be Detained and Punished, Measures to Restrict Warehouse Receipt Transactions to be Formulated

[Report from This Newspaper] The Economic Council held its first meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday in the City Hall auditorium. Representatives from various units attended, including Yu Shuping from the Police Department, Zhang Yamin from the Garrison Command, Wang Zhaoge, Wang Guanqing, Lin Xiexin, Shen Naizheng, Shen Zude from the City Government, Li Lixia from the Central Bank, Yan Zhuang from the Jiangsu Inspectorate, Xu Yaotian and Zhang Xiwei from the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Gao Bingtai from the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, Ye Xinming from the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse, Zhang Decheng from the Food Oil Committee, Zhang Chude from the Civil Food Allocation Committee, Gu Bingyuan from the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhao Zengjue from the Public Utilities Bureau, among others. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting. He reported that the significance of the shift in the work of the economic investigation team lies in the fact that the responsible and executing agencies of the past economic supervision work could not be closely linked. The establishment of the Economic Council will take the City Government as the center, and can obtain close and rapid communication with various administrative and executive agencies, which will surely increase work efficiency. It was decided at the meeting to set up five groups: Gold and Banknotes, Gauze, Food, Food Oil, and Fuel. The Gold and Banknotes group will be jointly organized by the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the Police Department. Other groups will be responsible by the responsible agencies. The Textile Management Committee will pay attention to the black market situation of cotton yarn, and the Garrison Department will regularly send personnel to the market for monitoring. In terms of fuel and food, the principle is to have sufficient production and sources. The first meeting did not end until 5:00 p.m.

Mayor Wu Reported Six Points

After the meeting, Mayor Wu met with reporters from various newspapers and reported six points: (1) A city-wide inspection will be implemented starting tomorrow. Because banks and money shops often engage in illegal speculation, the Ministry of Finance will send personnel to jointly conduct a general investigation of more than 200 banks and money shops in the city with the city government. The auditing work will be carried out in groups on a rotating basis, and will be repeated continuously. Senior personnel will be selected from the police station to receive specialized training to conduct audit work. (2) It was decided that all intercom telephones in the city will be dismantled starting today. Because intercom telephones have not been legally installed, they are equivalent to privately installed radio stations, disrupting the market and fueling speculation, which is very harmful.

### White Russians on the Xinjiang Border Forced to Flee, Traversing Half of China to Reach Shanghai, Hundreds of People Carrying the Young and Supporting the Old

[Report from this Newspaper] White Russians living on the northwestern border of Xinjiang, fearing some force, have traveled long distances across half of China to seek refuge in Shanghai. According to investigations by reporters, there are now forty-two families of White Russian refugees who have arrived in this city, totaling one hundred and forty-nine people. The youngest is a two-month-old baby, and the oldest is seventy-two years old. Of these, one hundred and seventeen people are temporarily residing in the Russian Commercial School on Beidang Road with the assistance of the Russian Emigrant Association. The refugees arrived in Shanghai in three batches. The first batch arrived on May 10, totaling fifty people. The second batch arrived at the end of May, totaling thirty-five people. The last batch was larger, arriving in Shanghai in mid-July. They left Yili on October 14 of last year, first traveling by horse or on foot to Dihua, then by truck via Lanzhou to Xi'an, and then by the Longhai Jinpu Railway to Beijing and then to Shanghai. The journey was extremely difficult. According to the representative of the refugees, they have lived in Yili for a long time, some for fifteen or even twenty-five years. This time, fearing that a great disaster was imminent, they had no choice but to leave. They reluctantly abandoned most of their belongings, with only a portion of their savings as travel expenses. Along the way, in addition to the assistance of the church in Lanzhou, they also received subsidies from the provincial governments of Xinjiang and Gansu. Officials and civilians along the way treated them with friendship and sympathy, providing assistance everywhere, which is extremely appreciated. The commercial school where they are currently residing is on summer vacation, and the school provides twelve rooms of various sizes for temporary accommodation. Some have beds, while others sleep on the floor. Food is provided separately by the Russian Emigrant Association and the school. The White Russian community in this city, moved by sympathy, has generously donated many clothes and shoes, which are displayed on the stone steps in front of the school building. Although some of the refugees' children are walking barefoot, they sing and play in the setting sun, seemingly forgetting the hardships of the journey. However, neither adults nor children are interested in being photographed, because in the past, being photographed in the border areas of Xinjiang was considered a dangerous thing.

According to the refugees, they all have the ability to make a living and are not vagrants. They hope to find work in Shanghai to support themselves. However, it is difficult because they do not speak Chinese or English. The jobs they can do are nothing more than making leather shoes, repairing watches, carpentry, and auto repair. As of this time, some young refugees have already found work in shops and schools. Also, some of the White Russian refugees came from Yili because they were asked to accept Soviet passports, while others came from Dihua, where there is currently no danger, but they fear that it will follow the example of Yili in the future, so they also decided to move. Currently, another group of refugees, numbering about two hundred, has already reached Hami on their way to Suzhou. When asked by reporters if there were Soviet troops in Yili, the refugees replied that Soviet troops not in uniform could be seen everywhere.

Past Life History of White Russian Refugees

The past life history of these refugees is inseparable from the ethnic disputes and conflicts on the Sino-Soviet border, the propaganda of the Communist Party, and the Soviet Union's attempt to control the Yili River Basin. The first people to settle in this area were the Cossacks who were defeated in the Russian Revolution, living in the Kuerjia area from 1917 to 1923. From 1929 to 1936, due to the promulgation of the new Soviet Constitution, ethnic groups dissatisfied with the status quo continued to move to Xinjiang. It is estimated that there were about 20,000 White Russians in Kuerjia and Dihua at that time, many of whom were craftsmen and technicians, and their lives were quite stable. Later, with the consent of Sheng Shicai, the power of the Soviet Union gradually invaded Xinjiang. They built airfields in the new province and established consultants in various departments of the provincial government. In 1940, the provincial government suddenly ordered refugees living in the province to produce Soviet registration certificates. At that time, the refugees deeply felt the danger of stateless people in ethnic conflicts on the border, and Soviet consultants took the opportunity to persuade them. As a result, three-quarters of the people registered, while the rest remained steadfast under any threat. By 1942, the fear of the refugees had subsided slightly because British and American consuls had arrived in Dihua and the Soviet Union was busy with the war. At that time, the Soviet Union's power in the new province seemed to be declining, and the White Russian refugees felt a little more free in spirit. In November 1944, an ethnic war broke out. According to White Russian refugees, White Russians and Soviet troops registered with the Soviet Union participated in the attack on the residence, power plant, and prison of the provincial chairman in Dihua. By 1945, the Soviet Union's control over the Yili region had been restored. At this time, White Russians were again required to register, but 200 White Russian families in Kuerjia County resolutely refused. Later, the so-called "East Turkestan Republic" was established. In September of last year, the local police began to interrogate White Russians from house to house. According to the refugees, those who had refused to register in the past were often arrested and charged with collusion with Japan. As early as 1933, a large number of White Russian officers were arrested and imprisoned until 1941, when they disappeared. Seeing that the crisis was imminent, they began to flee on a large scale. In the first five months, about 300 people fled. In January of this year, the local government prohibited residents from leaving the country. According to the latest news received by the White Russian chickens, the area has been under martial law for two months.

### Shenbao and Relief Hospital Continue to Jointly Offer Trachoma Screening and Treatment, The Seventh Session Will Start on July 1st, Specifically for Students

The "Trachoma Prevention and Treatment Campaign" jointly organized by this newspaper and the Relief Hospital at No. 547 Xizang South Road has been held for six sessions since it started last August. More than a thousand people have applied for treatment, but general young students have often been unable to receive complete treatment according to the time specified by the hospital due to their studies. In view of this, this newspaper has specially negotiated with the hospital authorities that from July 1st, trachoma screening and treatment will be provided specifically for young students, with a quota of 150 people. All middle and elementary school students suffering from trachoma or showing signs of trachoma can apply by letter. The procedure is to first prepare a detailed application form, have it stamped by the school they are attending, and submit it directly to the department for review. If qualified, a free medical certificate will be sent. In order to avoid overcrowding, face-to-face consultations will not be accepted. It is hoped that this will be appreciated. (The eighth session will start on August 1st, with the same quota and application procedure)

### Reader Consulting - Legal Questions

(1) "Adopted Son" Dispute

Yan Yansheng asks: My friend Mr. A was adopted by adoptive parents at the age of two and raised to adulthood. Recently, he was excluded from the family tree during genealogy revision. Now I have several questions. Please answer: (1) Does a child adopted and raised by adoptive parents from infancy have the right to inherit the property of the adoptive parents? (2) Do babies from orphanages or baby care centers have legal protection with a certificate? (3) In rural customs, adopted sons are not allowed to be included in the family tree. What methods can be used to remedy this? (4) If the biological parents want to take him back, what legal methods should the adoptive parents use to prevent this? (5) If the two families merge into one, is it legally permissible? (6) If the biological parents die, can Mr. A wear mourning clothes? Is it illegal?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) According to Article 1142, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, the inheritance share of an adopted child is one-half of that of a child born in marriage. However, when the adoptive parents have no lineal descendants, their inheritance share is the same as that of a child born in marriage. (2) It can only be used as proof of adoption. (3) There is no legal effect under current law. (4) Adoption of children should be based on careful consideration and can be based on the agreements made by both parties. (5) The meaning of the words is unclear and cannot be answered. (6) "Wearing mourning clothes" is a local custom and has nothing to do with the law.

(2) Establishing an Heir for Inheritance

Chuan Meizhen asks: My father passed away in 1920, leaving a considerable fortune. Later, a certain Mr. A from the clan was established as the heir and inherited two-thirds of the estate. Now I am married. I have several questions. Please answer: (1) After my mother's death, do Mr. A and his son have the right to inherit my mother's estate? (2) If Mr. A has the right to inherit, can Mr. A's inheritance share only be within one-half of the property jointly owned by my mother and me? Can that one-half be considered my personal property? (3) When I got married, my mother gave me one-half of the property as a dowry, and my mother wants to give me the other one-half after her death. After my mother's death, does Mr. A have the right to protest, requesting living expenses or a special reserved portion, and take back some of the inheritance to act as an inheritance share from my mother's gift to me or bequest? (4) If my mother uses the existing property to support my husband, after my mother's death, does Mr. A have the right to protest to my husband and take it back for his inheritance?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui answers] (1) Mr. A has the right to inherit your mother's estate after her death (according to Article 7 of the Enforcement Law of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code, the inheritance order and inheritance share of heirs established before the implementation of the Inheritance Section of the Civil Code are the same as those of children born in marriage for inheritances that begin after implementation). (2) Yes, two-thirds of his one-third can be considered the woman's property. (3) Your mother's one-half of the existing property has already been given to the woman as a dowry, and there is still one-half that can be used as Mr. A's inheritance share. (4) Legal buying and selling are of course effective, but attention must be paid to the disposition of jointly owned property, which should be with the consent of all co-owners.

Horticultural Talents Seeking Employment: I have received education in agriculture, flowers, and horticulture, and have worked in farms and Western nurseries for many years. I have considerable experience in greenhouses, planting flowers, planting fruit trees, raising goldfish, and raising pigeons, as well as collecting seeds by myself using matching methods for chrysanthemums, roses, and lotus flowers, and broadcasting good species of exotic flowers and rare plants. Those who want to hire me, please send a letter to Peng Songnian, No. 409, Shangqiu Road, Hanyang Road, Hongkou.

### Horrific Tragedy at Lingnan University High School: Students Beat the Director of Academics to Death, Judge Visits School to Investigate and Orders Surveillance of Students

[Report from Guangzhou on the 1st of this Month] Liu Shangzhi, Cen Mingxiao, and other representatives of senior high school students at Lingnan University High School here forced Cai Huinan, the director of academics, to publicly reveal the exam questions. When their purpose was not achieved, they severely beat Cai, who died on the evening of the 29th from serious injuries. Cai Qiu then cried and pleaded with Li Yulin, the president of Lingnan University, to pursue the murderer, comfort the family, and take care of the funeral, and also appealed to the authorities and various agencies. The Guangdong Department of Education sent personnel on the 30th to strictly investigate the truth of the incident. Cai was a Bachelor of Physics from Shanghai University and a Master of Physics from the University of the Philippines. He had taught at Lingnan University for eleven years and left behind three sons and one daughter.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st] A horrific tragedy occurred here on the evening of the 28th of last month. At around 7:00 PM that evening, Cai Huipu, director of academics and chemistry teacher at Lingnan University High School, was forced by senior high school students to hand over the chemistry exam questions for the graduation exam. Cai refused to give them, and the students turned off the lights and beat him up before kicking him down from the third floor to the second floor, immediately rupturing a blood vessel in his brain. On the morning of the 29th, Cai was still unconscious and was sent to Boji Hospital for treatment, but he died at 10:00 PM that night. Cai was from Guangdong, 46 years old, with a Master of Physics from the University of the Philippines. He had served as an assistant teacher at Shanghai University and as the principal of Wuchang Bowen Middle School. He had been employed at Lingnan University High School since 1938, for nearly ten years. The judge examined the injuries and visited the school to investigate, believing that the students in the class were highly suspected and ordered the school to place the students in the class under surveillance first.

### Beiyang Ping Department to Start Holiday on the 7th

[Report from Beiping on the 1st of this Month] The issue of the affiliation of the Beiyang Ping Department is becoming increasingly complex. The school's supporters and those who oppose Peking University's takeover have clearly divided into two factions. The current director, Chen Shoumin, and most of the professors are opposed, while most of the students are in favor of Peking University's takeover. Although Hu Shi initially wanted to take over, he has retreated in the face of this complex relationship. The department held a school affairs meeting today and has decided on the issue of the semester's curriculum under the premise of maintaining the status quo. The holiday will start on the 7th, and enrollment will begin at the beginning of next month.

### Overseas Student Examination for Three Sessions to Be Suspended This Year

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The College Entrance Examination Board of the United States will ask the State Council to establish examination centers in major cities around the world so that overseas students can take the English exam before going to the United States. According to Liu Yingshi, acting director of the International Cultural and Educational Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, this measure is very reasonable. Chinese university students who intend to study in the United States in the future must make the most adequate preparations in English. However, the matter has not yet been made into a law in the United States, so the departure of the second batch of publicly and privately funded overseas students selected by the Ministry of Education will not be affected. According to reliable sources, the overseas student examination for the third session will be suspended this year.

Public School Achievement Exhibition to Be Postponed The first Public School Achievement Exhibition was originally scheduled for July 6th, according to the municipal public school calendar. However, since the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has scheduled a Far East Basic Education Conference to be held in Beijing on September 1st, and because municipal public schools have always placed great emphasis on basic education, it was decided that the best achievements from this exhibition should be sent to UNESCO for display and observation. Therefore, all public schools felt that the original exhibition date was too soon, leaving them insufficient time for preparation. A proposal was made at the 21st Municipal Public School Principals Work Discussion Meeting to postpone the exhibition, which was approved. It is now known that the Municipal Education Bureau recently notified 11 newly appointed district officers, including Bao Changping, from various public schools, that the first preparatory meeting for the first Public School Achievement Exhibition will be held at 3 PM on the 4th of this month in the Education Bureau conference room to discuss matters related to the exhibition and to determine the exhibition date.

East China United University to Establish Six Colleges and Twenty Departments, Enrolling New Students Separately at the End of This Month [Our Newspaper] The East China United University, formed by the merger of St. John's University, Hangzhou University, and Soochow University, has been actively preparing for several months through the board of directors and responsible persons from each school. They have now agreed on preliminary cooperative measures for the next semester, namely, jointly recruiting first-year students. It has been decided that entrance exams will be held from the 29th to the 30th of this month. Registration will begin on the 14th in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. Exam locations will also be designated in the aforementioned three cities to facilitate students taking the exam nearby. Entrance examination subjects will follow regulations from the Ministry, and will include Chinese, English, Mathematics, Civics, Chinese and Foreign History and Geography, Physics and Chemistry, and Biology. The United University will be divided into six colleges: Arts, Sciences, Law, Commerce, Engineering, and Medicine, which will contain the following twenty departments: Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, Education, History, Journalism, Political Science, Economics, Sociology, Law (Law Group, Administrative Law Group, Judicial Group), Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Business Administration, Accounting, Banking, International Trade, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Architectural Engineering, and Chemical Engineering.

Midwifery School Graduates' Qualifying Examination Rescheduled, Nurses School Graduates' Qualifying Examination The qualifying examination for graduates of nursing and midwifery vocational schools never stopped during the Anti-Japanese War. The Municipal Education Bureau has been actively preparing since being ordered to conduct this examination. It began on June 30th at Yucai Middle School and is scheduled to be completed on July 3rd. All nursing school graduates have participated, and the examination hall is orderly. The news of a nurses' school graduate strike reported yesterday is completely inaccurate. However, midwifery school graduates did not attend the examination because the examination subject was originally designated as "Practical Examination," but the Ministry suddenly changed it to "Bacteriology," leaving them unprepared. Xie Engao, Director of the Secondary Education Department of the Municipal Education Bureau, believes that passing this examination is crucial for students to obtain practice certificates, which is significant for their future. He convened the principals of each school to discuss rescheduling the examination to rectify the situation. The schools have unanimously expressed their agreement.

It was decided that each district in the city would donate and build one national school, totaling 30 schools. In addition to the operating expenses already included in this year's municipal government budget, the construction funds have also been successfully raised by the Municipal Council and construction will begin separately soon. According to the Council's estimate, the construction materials will require 900,000 feet of foreign pine and 200,000 tons of steel bars, which is an astounding amount at current market prices.

Chengyou Triumphs in Hangzhou, Successively Defeating Hangzhou Youth and Qiantang [Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st] The lakeside ball games in Hangzhou are still very lively in early summer. On the 29th, the Chengyou team, the champion of the second division in Shanghai, traveled to Hangzhou and first played against Hangzhou Youth. Chengyou won by a large margin, 53 to 22. At 3 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, they played a friendly match against the strong local team Qiantang at the Youth Hall court. Chu Yusheng was invited as the referee. Hangzhou fans had been waiting at the court under the scorching sun since noon. At 3 PM sharp, the referee blew the whistle, and the two sides began to battle. Qiantang took the lead, scoring two points first. Then, Chengyou's forward reached Qiantang's basket, and the defender was penalized for two free throws. Chengyou missed both shots, and the audience regretted it. Qiantang returned to the attack, but Chengyou ultimately used its coordination and close-range shots to its advantage. Both sides competed fiercely, and the match was very exciting. In the last six minutes of the first half, Chengyou scored three consecutive goals and took a 21-31 lead, leaving Qiantang ten points behind. After a water break, the game resumed. Chengyou attacked frequently, and Qiantang could only defend. The highest score difference was 35 to 15. Qiantang fought hard to counterattack, but time ran out, and they lost 49 to 35. [Our Newspaper, Shanghai] The Morning Friends basketball team from this city set out for Wuling on the 28th of last month and arrived in Hangzhou at noon that day. The weather was poor, and the competition was unable to proceed that day. The next day, the visiting team risked travelling in the rain and toured the West Lake. On the 30th, at 3pm, they responded to Qiantang's invitation, again with the Morning Friends winning, 49-35. Following the games, military instructor Wu Xihong, Physical Education Director of the Suan Qiao Aviation School, eagerly tried to keep the visiting team, in order to hold friendly matches, but the Morning Friends team members, due to work and vacation time reasons, were unable to accept, and all 14 members of the team immediately returned to Shanghai that night.

Textile Adjustment Committee to Set Up Public Warehouses in Guangzhou, Tianjin, Hankou, Cotton Yarn Allocation Will Not Be Limited [Our Newspaper] Liu Siying, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, met with reporters yesterday in the conference room of the Textile Adjustment Committee. He answered reporters' questions regarding the current textile adjustment policies. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) Regarding the current policies of the Textile Adjustment Committee on cotton yarn and cloth adjustment, a joint allocation system has been established in this city. For other areas, it is planned to first set up cotton yarn and cloth public warehouses in Guangzhou and Tianjin, and Hankou is also planned. The cotton yarn in each public warehouse will be transported and sold by the Textile Adjustment Committee and manufacturers. However, manufacturers must first obtain a transport and sales permit from the Textile Adjustment Committee. After tax-paid cotton yarn is transported to various places, it will be stored centrally in the local public warehouses, which will be responsible for the joint allocation in each area. The allocation price will be based on the negotiated price of cotton yarn in Shanghai. (2) In the future, after the establishment of public warehouses in various places, the existing methods of transporting goods south and north will be virtually abolished. The number of goods transported to various places can be unlimited, depending on the needs of each area. (3) A joint export agency will also be set up for the export of cotton yarn in the future. In addition to state-owned factories providing 20% of their current production for export, it is also hoped that private factories can increase their production by 20% of their current output for joint export. (4) The Ministry of Economic Affairs plans to set up several investigation agencies in the Nanyang area to first investigate the types and styles of cotton yarn and its products needed in various parts of Nanyang to provide a reference for domestic exports. (5) Currently, 70% of the cotton yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories is 20-count yarn. At least that portion of the cotton yarn will be provided to the Textile Adjustment Committee for joint allocation. (6) Now that the cotton yarn produced by state-owned and private yarn factories is provided for joint allocation, the government's purchase of cotton yarn can be discontinued. (7) After the negotiated price of cotton yarn is set, the prices of other cotton yarn-replicated products also need to be negotiated based on the negotiated price of cotton yarn to determine reasonable prices. [Another Report] According to the observation of a tea and textile authority: The most important thing for the government's current cotton yarn and cloth adjustment policies is to strive for reasonable and effective allocation. Reasonable allocation is even more important than lowering yarn prices, so a joint allocation system has been created. If this system is ineffective, then entrusted spinning and weaving Jian will be considered. If this is still not enough, then production and sales registration will be carried out to implement a comprehensive system of unified purchase and unified sales. As for the purchase of cotton yarn, the government's supply of foreign exchange will likely continue. He pointed out that the government's current implementation of the joint allocation system hopes to thoroughly implement joint price negotiation and joint allocation. He hopes that all yarn factories will prioritize the welfare of the country and society and not be solely concerned with their own private interests. However, it is heard that private factories hope to jointly negotiate prices but individually allocate goods in order to maintain the business freedom of private factories. [Another Report] The head of a private factory told reporters yesterday: In order to stabilize yarn prices due to recent fluctuations in cotton yarn market prices, the Textile Adjustment Committee has temporarily agreed with various yarn factories to jointly allocate goods on a trial basis, with each state-owned and private yarn factory providing 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn to be delivered by the 15th of this month for joint allocation. The cotton yarn outside of the 10,000 pieces will still be transported and sold freely by each factory. Moreover, the 10,000 pieces provided are for a trial run and do not mean that each factory is required to provide 10,000 pieces of yarn every half month.

Remittances to Wuzhou and Hengyang Will Also Be Restricted Due to recent capital flight to Hong Kong and arbitrage by merchants, exchange rates in South China have fluctuated drastically. National banks have implemented austerity measures, and the Central Bank has restricted the amount of money that commercial banks can remit to Guangdong and Fujian provinces to 50 million yuan per week. After this regulation, some unscrupulous merchants have found ways to remit money to places such as Wuzhou and Hengyang, and then transfer it to Huayang in order to achieve their goals. The Central Bank is paying attention to the development of this situation and will also strictly restrict it.

Meeting to Discuss Shipping Qingdao Edible Oil to Shanghai Scheduled for Saturday Regarding the issue of shipping edible oil from Qingdao to Shanghai, Cao Peizi, Director of the Qingdao Social Affairs Bureau, went to Beijing a few days ago to ask the relevant ministries and courtyards of the Economic, Food, and Social Affairs Departments for instructions. Cao returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and told reporters that Qingdao produces more than 3,000 tons of edible oil per month, with soybean oil being the main product. Local consumption only requires about 60 tons per month. If transportation difficulties can be resolved and a fixed quantity can be shipped out on schedule, it will be enough to curb the current rise in edible

The blacksmith was a large man, the largest in the area, with strong shoulders, and a face and arms tanned by the flames of the forge and the iron dust from the hammer. Beneath his square skull and thick hair, he had large, green, childlike eyes that sparkled like steel. His wide jaw exuded laughter and snoring breath, as immense and joyful as the giant breathing from his bellows; though he was fifty years old, when he raised his arms with a satisfied and powerful posture—a habit he had acquired from his usual blacksmithing—he seemed even more energetic than a youth, using his "Miss," a twenty-five-pound hammer, which he alone could wield from Vernon to Tonon, a terrifying tool.
I lived in the blacksmith's house for a full year, a year of convalescence.
My heart was restless, my mind was confused, I went out, walking forward, searching for myself, searching for a peaceful and working corner where I could regain my strength. One afternoon, after crossing the village, I glimpsed a blacksmith shop, isolated and full of red light, lying across the four-way intersection. The firelight was so radiant that it shot out from the wide-open carriage door, making the crossroads glow with a fire-like red, and causing the poplars lined up along the river opposite to emit a dazzling light like torches. In the distance, in the soft twilight, the rhythmic hammering sounded miles away, like an approaching iron army running across the wilderness. There, under the wide-open door, in the light of the forge and the thunderous vibrations and noise, I stopped, watching the work, watching these hands on the red-hot iron rods, twisting and smoothing them, I already felt very happy and had gained great spiritual comfort.
On this autumn evening, I first saw the blacksmith forging a plow. His shirt was open, revealing his thick chest. His sides, with each breath, revealed steel-like muscles. He leaned back, assuming an attacking posture, and struck down his hammer. In this way, he continued his work uninterrupted, with the soft movements of his body and the firm strength of his muscles. The iron rod rotated in a regular circle, bringing many sparks and leaving a kind of flash behind it. What the blacksmith was wielding with both hands was "Miss." As for his son, a lively young man of twenty, he used tongs to hold the burning red iron and also struck the iron with his hammer, making dull sounds, but ultimately unable to match the loud dance of the old man's terrifying "Miss." Dok, dok—dok, dok, people thought it was a mother's solemn voice encouraging her child's first words. "Miss" was still "waltzing," shaking the shining iron stones on her dance dress, letting her heels imprint on the red plowshare. Each time she jumped heavily on the anvil, she changed the shape of the iron under her feet. A blood-like flame flowed all the way to the ground, illuminating the protruding cheekbones of the two workers, their huge shadows stretching across the dark and blurred corners of the forge. Gradually, the red light faded, and the blacksmith stopped. He stood darkly, leaning on the handle of the hammer, sweat streaming down his forehead, but he did not wipe it away. In the roar of the bellows, which his son slowly pumped by hand, I heard the breathing of his still-shaking chest. That night, I slept in the blacksmith's house, and I never left here again. I had an empty room upstairs above the forge, provided by him and which I was happy to accept. From five o'clock in the morning, when the sky was not yet bright, I participated in my master's work. I was awakened by the sounds of the whole house, this joyful and happy sound, which continued until night. Below me, the hammer was dancing. "Miss" continuously knocked on the ceiling under my feet, as if calling me to get up, regarding me as a lazy person. The whole poor room, its large wardrobe, its white wooden table, its two chairs, all creaked, as if urging me to get dressed quickly. I had to go downstairs. Downstairs, I saw that the forge was already red. The bellows roared, blue and rose-colored flames rising from the coal, and spherical bodies of stars shone under the gusts of the charcoal fire. However, the blacksmith was preparing for his day's work. He moved the raw material in the corner, surrounded the plow, and checked the wheels. When he saw me, he immediately put his fists on his waist, this respectable man, he smiled, his mouth stretching all the way to his ears. Getting me out of bed at five o'clock seemed to make him happy. He believed he was striking for the sake of striking, awakening everyone early in the morning with the terrifying ensemble of his hammer. He put his huge hand on my shoulder, he leaned over and spoke to me as if speaking to a child, saying that since I had lived among his scrap iron, my body had become healthier. Every day, we drank white wine together at the back of an overturned old car.
Then, I lived in the forge, spending my day there. Especially in the winter when it rained, I lived there all day. I became interested in the work of the forge. The blacksmith's continuous struggle of hammering the raw iron that he arbitrarily changed and modified finally moved me like a powerful tragedy. I watched the metal from the furnace to the anvil, I watched it bend, stretch, and roll like soft wax under the worker's victorious efforts, and I couldn't help but feel surprised by this exquisite craftsmanship. When the plow was finished, I knelt in front of it. I no longer remembered the rough appearance of the unfinished product the night before. I examined the parts. I dreamed, I thought that supremely powerful fingers had cast it so wonderfully, and did not need the assistance of fire. Sometimes, I smiled, I thought of a young girl I had seen before, across from my window, using her slender hands to twist brass wire, and using a silk thread to tie artificial violets onto these copper wires.
The blacksmith never sighed. I had seen him, after hammering iron for fourteen hours during the day, laughing happily at night and scrubbing his arms with a satisfied attitude. He never worried, never got tired. He could support his house with his shoulders, if his house were about to collapse. In winter, he said it was warm in his forge. In summer, he left the doors wide open so that the smell of hay could come in. When summer came and the sun was about to set, I went to the door and sat beside him. We were halfway up the mountain; from there we could see the wide area of the valley. He silently observed this infinitely large, green felt-like cultivated land, disappearing into the twilight purple horizon, and felt very happy.
The blacksmith often joked. He said that all this land belonged to him, and his forge had been supplying plows to the entire surrounding area for more than two hundred years. This was his pride. Without him, there would be no abundant harvests. The reason why the plains were green in May and yellow in July, and why they had this velvet-like changing appearance, was entirely due to his efforts. He loved the crops in the fields as much as his own daughter. When the sun was good, he was happy. When it hailed, he raised his fists against the black clouds on the horizon. Often, he pointed out to me a piece of land in the distance that looked no bigger than the back of a coat, and he told me that in a certain year, he had made a plow for that square field of buckwheat or barley. When the planting season came, he sometimes set aside his hammer. He went to the side of the road, put his hands on his legs, and watched the emerging seedlings in front of him. He watched many plows from his family go deep into the soil, turning over their furrows on the left or right of the opposite side. The valley was filled with his products. To see the plowing horses moving slowly forward, one could almost say that it was many armies marching. The plowshares sparkled in the sun with a silver-like reflection. He raised his arm, he called me, he wanted me to see how "sacred" a task they were doing.
All this brilliant ironware sounding under my feet filled my blood with steel. This was more valuable than any medicine in the pharmacy. I got used to this disturbing sound, I needed this music of the hammer hitting the anvil to hear my own life. In my entire room, agitated by the roar of the bellows, I had rediscovered my poor mind. Dok, dok—dok, dok, this was simply the happy pendulum that regulated my working hours. When the work was most intense and the blacksmith was angry, I heard the red iron creaking under the devilish hammer, and I had a giant-like heat in the palms of my hands, and I wanted to flatten the whole world with the tip of my pen. Then, when the forge was silent, there was also complete silence in my mind; I went downstairs, saw this conquered metal that was still smoking, and I felt ashamed of my work.
Ah! Sometimes, on hot afternoons, I saw how majestic the blacksmith was! He was naked to the waist, his protruding and tense muscles, like a colossus of Michelangelo, expressing supreme power. Watching him, I discovered the lines of modern sculpture, which our artists laboriously seek in the dead flesh of Greece. In my eyes, he seemed to be the great hero of labor, the tireless descendant of this century, who constantly forged our tools of analysis on the anvil, and used iron and fire to create our future society. He made his hammer his toy. When he wanted to laugh, he picked up his "Miss" and quickly struck the anvil. So he filled his whole family with thunderous sounds in the rose-colored breath of the furnace. I thought I heard the groans of the working people.
It was there, in the forge full of plows, that I was forever cured of my laziness and doubt.
### Zola's Social Justice

Whenever French realism is mentioned, people only think of Flaubert and Maupassant. In fact, Zola was the master of this aspect. Zola's method was the most unique and radical method of French realism in the nineteenth century. He captured all social phenomena with deep observation. Romanticists slightly touched on the petty bourgeoisie and the lower classes in addition to depicting heroes and beauties, while Zola used the greatest energy to depict them. In order to find what he wanted to depict, he once went deep into the lower classes and wrote biographies for prostitutes. He wanted to accuse everything of oppressed souls.
When the famous Dreyfus affair occurred, Zola was angered by social justice, and he did not hesitate to launch a fierce attack at any sacrifice.
The facts were as follows: Dreyfus, a Jew, was arrested and imprisoned for allegedly leaking military secrets during the war. But in fact, he was innocent. The real criminal was later discovered. However, ordinary French people and militarists with racial prejudices still refused to overturn Dreyfus's verdict and even sentenced him to exile. Zola could not tolerate such injustice, so he published the famous open letter "I Accuse" in the newspaper to impeach the illegal actions of the military authorities. At the same time, he distributed many pamphlets to arouse the attention of the national opinion circles. The French opinion circles were indeed stirred up by this. Those who supported Zola included literary giants France, Mirbeau, Clemenceau, and Jaurès, who was later assassinated for opposing the European War. The other faction added a bad name to Zola, scolding Zola as a traitor and suing him for false accusation.
On February 12, 1898, Zola had to be judged by the court. When Zola arrived at the court, he was still angry and willing to guarantee Dreyfus's innocence with his life and reputation.
However, the court, which had no justice at all, finally sentenced Zola to one year in prison and a fine of three thousand francs. Zola had to leave England and live a life of escape for one year.
Zola ruthlessly exposed the darkness of society and resisted all unjust acts. Now, let's study what kind of position Zola took as his own position in exposing the various phases of the dark side. We can see from the above facts. He was a social justice fighter who did not hesitate to fight against the autocratic politics of great-power chauvinism. Although he was criticized by public opinion and judged by law, his anger was always vented towards the evil exploiters. However, this was only a sense of justice, and his position was only limited to this.
He said: "...If this continues, France will inevitably be led to destruction. If we want to improve society, we must start with improving families." From these words, we can see Zola's true face.
At present, we still need this kind of social justice, but we hope that our writers can also express and uphold justice like Zola. Purple Wisteria Cuckoo, Lingxu Village Sketches, Gao Luan

Night Owl
The first night I slept in a small village surrounded by clear blue streams, and fantasy made me feel boundless horror and trembling. The night was pitch black, and the earth seemed to have died for countless years. I curled up on the bed, deeply regretting that I shouldn't have blown out the vegetable oil lamp that reflected a faint yellow light, and that I shouldn't have carefully bolted the bamboo door of the thatched cottage. Usually, I don't believe that those ethereal water goblins and tree spirits will grab people, but when it comes to this "May in the countryside, no one breaks in," like the defeated soldiers retreating on the firing line, and the hunters closely chasing the deer, timidity firmly entangles the ancient cypress like a long-lasting ivy. The miserable howling of the night owl and the chattering of fish made me have no strength, even a little bit, to resist its threat.
Perhaps this is a kind of abnormal psychology, but in the deep night of that water village, those night owls that usually live on the big camphor trees by the stream always let out sharp howls like those of criminals about to be executed. The superstitious color in the countryside is particularly strong. As long as you associate it a little, the gloomy ghosts seem to really exist in the world. It's not that I believe in "ghosts," but in reality, the howling of the night owl is indeed a bit too mournful...
Gunfire
It's quite interesting to talk with those innocent and sincere farmers under the moonlight. One evening, we were "telling jokes" when suddenly that guy's voice seeped in from a field of croaking frogs. Speaking of that "guy," everyone had to be apprehensive. The surrounding villages have not been peaceful recently, and the faint sound of gunfire can often be heard in the breeze from afar. Farmers don't have the talent to express their feelings, so silence is their only way. I looked at the crescent moon in the sky hooking on the blue background, and I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy in my heart. After a while, dog barks mixed with noisy voices and crying. The shimmering night light was reflected in the far and near paddy fields, and I understood the "blood" and "tears" of the farmers. Old Wei said: "Robbers were originally farmers who couldn't survive." One robbery after another, I was really afraid that the gentle water village would become a world of bandits.
Morning Mist
In the morning there was a heavy fog. Looking at the mountains, rivers, grass, and trees on the opposite bank from a distance, they were all blurred as if some omnipotent being had draped them with a light and delicate gauze. The morning mist here is very charming. All the mountains are submerged in a white mist. The cattle, sheep, and village houses make people suspect that this is a scene in a fairy tale. Ying was washing clothes by the stream under the thick shade, and I stood beside her, facing such a misty stream and mountains, I couldn't help but let the steed of my memories of the past run wild: the past was as hazy as the mist, which blurred my eyes. There were my sorrows and desires, my joys. The colors of the past were complicated. It was dyed with my infinite "colors of life." I had love and hate, laughter and tears. The fog of life, the life of fog, but it has never been as beautiful as the misty scenery of the water village. Ying was probably also moved by this "fog," and she looked back and smiled at me!
Don't stay in the wind and fog any longer. In a little while, the sun will come out. The scenery is certainly not as charming as it is now, but it is still relatively bright, decent, and formal. Old Tree, Xuan Jianren
Old tree, the sweet home of blackbirds.
I don't know its date of birth, nor do I know how many springs, summers, autumns, and winters it has survived. But its trunk gives me a feeling of old age; when I push open the window and look into the distance, its green leaves give me a sense of beauty. When the wind comes, it gives me a signal, whether it is morning or night.
As soon as the sun comes out of the mountain, the melodious songs of the golden oriole gently knock on the door of my dreams. I turned over, fatigue still entangled me, and I didn't want to get up. Listen, listen to this beautiful song. The magpies, not willing to be outdone, also opened their throats to sing, as if competing for the championship. Only the clumsy singers of the sparrows make people feel uncomfortable; this symphony is so discordant, but it is youthful.
On the branches of the old tree, birds have built many nests, adorning its beauty.
Old tree, it is like a green umbrella, held up to the sun. An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood, 332, Ye Jingfeng
Mr. W was very anxious about this matter, so he asked me and Tsurumi to go upstairs for a confidential discussion. This was on the afternoon of the fourth. At that time, Tsurumi seemed to be at a loss, because these three unsatisfactory things were closely related to him. At the same time, he had to leave that night; Matsui had arranged two routes for him to return to his country; one, to take a military transport ship from Tianjin, which would reach Tokyo in 24 hours; two, to take a military plane to Shenyang, transfer to Busan, and fly to Tokyo, which would take a shorter time.
We discussed for an hour, and finally decided that I would take the stage to sing this big final piece; first go to Tianjin, use the "No. 15" method, and carry out activities at the Japanese military headquarters. At the same time, Mr. W arranged for those in the Tianjin anti-espionage organization who had not been poisoned to find a way to contact me and risk rescuing Yaoqun and the detained comrades.
Because Tsurumi had to go to Shenyang to make some arrangements, he decided to take the second route arranged for him by Matsui. Before parting, he held my hand tightly:
Brother Yiyue, the matter of relocating the headquarters to Shanxi will be decided after I send a letter from Tokyo. In any case, the headquarters matter must be entrusted to you, old brother!... Regarding the Tianjin matter, Yaoqun and Little Tiger, and the matter of the comrades in this area, also have to be entrusted to you, old brother!... And the matter here (referring to Mr. W's headquarters in Beiping), there may not be any big trouble recently; if there is trouble, you, old brother, will have to worry and "help out" a bit; this also has to be entrusted to you, old brother!"
There are a total of three "entrustments" here; the first two entrustments are considered to be under my name, so even if he didn't entrust them, since I had taken on this mission, I had to do my best. But what file is this third entrustment about? The two words "help out," because his Mandarin was not thorough after all, may be a misuse of "help"; but how could it be entrusted to me? Mr. W's brain and skills are many dozens of hundreds of times better than mine. Who am I? Why also "entrust" it to me?
Finally, he grabbed my hand again, adding a bit of strength, and shook it hard a few times: "This time I go to Tokyo, my 'life and death are uncertain.' Regarding Pingzi's matter, I don't know what kind of magic it is, and I can't guess it either. I can only try my luck. If it goes well, of course, everything will be fine; Pingzi is a good hand and should be used as much as possible. If it doesn't go well, the matter of our twelve secret stations also has to be entrusted to you, old brother!" Saying this, he gradually lowered his head.
These four "entrustments" have a strong meaning of "entrusting posthumous affairs." While reluctantly agreeing, I also felt very apprehensive.
After entrusting me, he gave Mr. W the same four entrustments, only the third item changed its wording. A person in his twenties, who had always been open-minded, suddenly became so long-winded. Tsurumi's mood at this time was imaginable, as if he had suddenly lost his basis, and he couldn't help but feel a little sad and absent-minded.
After Tsurumi left, Mr. W and I reviewed the program we had just discussed again. Because the matter was of great importance, we had to be so careful. Under review, we carefully considered the "No. 15" method to see if it could be applied smoothly and whether there would be any future troubles.
What is called "No. 15"? This is not a new invention of Tsurumi and mine. Ordinary international top-level intelligence field agents all have this method of operation. However, it was Tsurumi's creation to mechanize these methods and list them as numbers; there are endless conveniences. (The highest special field agent, that is, an international spy, is "single-line," and does not have relations with other field agents, and is only commanded by the headquarters.)
I remember that in the past, in German Major Buto's "Memoirs of the European War," he described how the third Prince Wilhelm of the German Emperor went to the United States incognito and mingled among dock workers, specializing in setting fires in military industrial raw material stacks using chemical methods. Several large stacks burned spontaneously in the middle of the night for no reason. The losses in the United States were very heavy. (This style of work is single-line, although there are stipulated targets, it has the right to act independently and does not contact other spies).
Later, this mysterious prince who set the fire was detected by top-level agents of the US intelligence department, and the prince, who was bedridden, was also captured. At that time, a former German diplomat stationed in the United States came forward in Switzerland to negotiate, willing to exchange four American generals captured by Germany. The US State Department originally intended to agree, but the intelligence department firmly refused.
C returned from Germany. He had been away from his motherland for more than ten years in a hurry. The world is changing, white clouds turn into gray dogs. Especially in these ten years of the most intense turmoil, one can't help but feel the vicissitudes of life.
In the first two days of arriving in Shanghai, many jokes came out. What francs, gold pounds, US dollars, legal tender; just the currency system problem, Dubo Mantan, Wang Cong
made this great doctor who was proficient in both Chinese and Western cultures have a headache. I suddenly remembered the two sentences "Cars share the same tracks, and books use the same script," thinking about the divided situation in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Qin Shihuang's "unification of cars and books" was really a miraculous achievement in history.
One day, Sister C and I took a public bus, and Sister C rushed to buy tickets. Her expression was like she was hosting a big feast.
"Did you really come from Germany? Or from the countryside?" Obviously, my words were full of sarcasm.
Sister C smiled. After a while, she solemnly asked me; "Are the bus tickets very expensive now? Are they hundreds of thousands?"
This sentence may make the Shanghai citizens of June in the 35th year of the Republic of China laugh, but if the current prices were predicted to a friend ten years ago, wouldn't they also find it absurd? It's simply unbelievable, with 500,000 yuan for one load of rice, wouldn't everyone starve to death? But, strangely, we haven't starved to death yet. Amen! Free Talk Biographies, Jiang Tingfu's Comeback, Ping Qi
On the evening of October 8 last year, a rather enthusiastic cocktail party was held at the Yiyuan Hotel. The host was all the staff of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA), and the reason for holding the cocktail party was to bid farewell to Mr. Jiang Tingfu, the director of the RRA who had just resigned.
At that time, three universities in the United States telegraphed inviting Mr. Jiang to teach; Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, and Mei Yiqi, the president of Tsinghua University, also rushed to telegraph him to recruit him. However, Mr. Jiang told me: he decided to rest for two months first, no matter what.
Recently, the United Nations Far East Economic Conference was held in Shanghai. Among the delegations from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, most were people related to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)—such as Ms. Hinde from Britain, Kirkpatrick from the United States, and Semynas from the Soviet Union. However, unexpectedly, the name of Huo Baoshu, the current director of the RRA, was not in the Chinese delegation. Instead, Jiang Tingfu made a comeback after eight months of silence, serving as the chief representative of China, and was elected as the chairman of the conference by an overwhelming majority.
Jiang's comeback was not accidental. In fact, the atmosphere at this conference was quite tense, and the handling was quite tricky. The Soviet representative, following their style in all international conferences, always made eccentric statements, even showing poor diplomatic courtesy and cultivation. And there came an Indian representative who echoed him, speaking especially often and being particularly combative. The Filipino representative, who once presided over the conference as vice-chairman, was somewhat in a dilemma—but under Jiang's chairmanship, everything proceeded very smoothly, and all the dangerous waves on the conference were finally able to be safely overcome.
Handling this kind of conference, even a slight mistake would damage the face of the entire country. But Jiang possessed all the conditions for handling this kind of conference: first, he had魄力 (poqi - courage and decisiveness); second, he had resolution; third, his historical cultivation enabled him to quickly summarize several key points after analyzing the problems in detail. Often, others spoke for a long time, but he only needed two or three sentences to impartially include all the main points; fourth, it was his reputation—although his work during his tenure in the RRA caused some dissatisfaction in some areas in China, his spirit of "staying if we agree, leaving if we disagree" only created a higher reputation internationally.
However, Jiang also possessed two extremely superior conditions, and these two conditions will inevitably enable him to have more brilliant achievements in the future: the first condition is: he is a person who is proficient in the situation in the Soviet Union. In the early days of the war, he estimated that the Soviet Union would not use force against Japan. Although he was attacked by many so-called "pro-Soviet people" at the time, the results proved that his views were correct. The second condition is: he is also a person who truly understands the United States. His estimate of the United States is also as accurate as his estimate of the Soviet Union. During his tenure in the RRA, American newspapers praised him almost unanimously, and his achievements in the Far East Economic Conference this time won countless praises again. Regardless of whether China is willing to become a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union in the future—people like Jiang Tingfu should not be "frozen" again. Anecdotes of Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty, Ji Ming
My late maternal grandfather once had a framed work of calligraphy by Hongwu, which was inscribed with twelve characters: "Shao Kangjie deduced the Book of Changes, I cherish it very much," the strokes were ancient and clumsy, even Zhong and Wang could not surpass it. According to the Zhu family, he was the second commoner revolutionary in our country. He lacked education in his childhood and became a monk when he grew up. His lack of learning and contempt for Confucian scholars were the same as those of Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty. The slightly different thing was that the assistants of Emperor Gaozu were mostly Zhang Liang's words of Huang Lao, and Xiao He's emphasis on pen and ink, with no Confucian scholars who lived up to their name. But the people around Zhu were mostly people like Song Lian and Liu Qun, who subtly taught him Confucianism. Therefore, when he was the King of Wu, he was able to draft rescue orders himself, as well as refute memorials. Moreover, when the mood struck, his poems and lyrics were also worth seeing. "Yu Chu Xu Zhi" recorded: When Emperor Taizu went to Jiangnan to conscript troops, he went to a certain temple, looked around the corridors and porches, and was arrogantly complacent. The monks in the temple then took out the donation book and asked him to inscribe it. Emperor Taizu did not answer, but they insisted on asking him to do so, so he wrote a quatrain on the wall, saying: "Kill all the million soldiers in Jiangnan, the precious sword at my waist is still stained with blood, the monks in the mountains do not know the wise master, they only care about asking my name." The monks in the temple were greatly frightened. After he left, they washed it off with water. When he ascended the throne, he ordered people to go and see it, but the inscription from the past was no longer there. The emperor was furious and detained all the monks in the temple, planning to put them in jail. One of the monks was also good at poetry, so he reported: "I dared not keep the imperial pen's poem, I was always afraid that ghosts and gods would be worried when I kept it, so I gently washed it with holy water, and there was still a ray of light shooting into the Big Dipper." The emperor turned his anger into joy, so he pardoned all the monks and ordered them to be ennobled. A Depressed Smile, Bu Shu
——Reading "Professor Bai Jimei"
In one of the previous issues of "People Magazine," there was an article by Wen Hua Jun called "Professor Bai Jimei." The author's emotion was deep and always made people unforgettable. He wrote out the conscience of a scientist, and also wrote out the oppression, damage, and disregard of society for scientists. Professor Bai Jimei's kindness reflected the cruelty of society; the result of his hard work was "working for ten years without getting rich, and running out of food as soon as he rested," which also reflected that a scientist and a university professor were far from having a promising future as "teaching dancing."
Professor Bai Jimei has written many scientific works, at least twelve kinds in terms of variety; at least ten million words in terms of word count. These works include General Surveying, Advanced Surveying, Geodetic Surveying, Plane Surveying, Hydrological Surveying, Railway Surveying, Applied Astronomy, Least Squares Method, Cartography, Navigation, Aerial Surveying, Mine Surveying, and Mathematical Geography. If he were in another country, his social status would be imaginable. However, he was unfortunate enough to be born in China, so until now, his life is the same as that of ordinary clerks:
"The house is a flat-roofed house that can be reached by hand, a large room divided into five small rooms, one of which is the kitchen. Ducks sometimes fly onto the backs of guests looking for food. Professor Bai takes care of the children while using a broom to drive away those hateful animals. In front of the window is another family dumping sewage and cooking, and there is fly excrement from the summer on the blackened wall... He has many children, and the whole family relies on him. There are no male servants or maids in the house. He does everything himself. Carrying water and sweeping the floor are all done by himself. A brain that is extremely useful to the country and a body that has a lot of energy that is extremely useful to mankind are consumed at home like this." (Wen Hua Jun's words)
This is the result of Professor Bai Jimei's decades of hard work. He was deceived by publishers several times. Once, because he was involved in the "re-repairing of the Fengdu Weir," he was even knocked to the ground by a rascal (who used to be his student) and vomited blood. Because of poverty, he sold off his clothes twice, including dictionaries and thesauruses. The ending of a good person, the ending of a pure, kind, and sincere person who wants to do some work for society, is so miserable. So embarrassing. Although there were foreign reporters in Britain and India who were unfair to him, please look at the reaction of Chinese society: it is still oppression and disregard.
Wen Hua Jun mentioned Professor Bai Jimei's smile several times in the article: when he was cheated by the publisher, he smiled depressingly; when people felt unfair about his experiences, he smiled depressingly again.
What a pitiful smile! I dare not imagine it. Closing my eyes, I seemed to see the figure of this kind old man with white hair. He smiled bitterly, without any desire or hope. His smile showed his fearlessness, and his smile was an extremely sarcastic satire of this society!
Think about those arrogant shouts: Why doesn't China have Einstein? Why doesn't it have Madame Curie? Why doesn't it have Edison, why doesn't it have Balzac, Tolstoy?...
In such shouts, many great scientists, artists, or writers have died in obscurity, have become prematurely senile in overworked environments, have been harmed and insulted and turned into a bitter smile, and have become depressed. Odds and Ends from America, Xu Ziyuan
America's Auxiliary Education
The reason why education in America is so developed is not the many schools, the exquisite architecture, or the extensive facilities, but the excellence of the system. Their system is more flexible and adapts to the needs of all levels of society. Although China's education system is taken from America, it has failed to take its strengths, and has become a formalistic education, which specializes in using exams to restrict young people, and studying has become a profession, maintained by subsidies and loans, and this is unheard of in world education.
Higher education in America is quite expensive. State-run universities charge about 25 yuan per semester. Private universities charge about 10 to 20 yuan per credit, and about 500 yuan or more per semester, such as Harvard University and the University of Chicago. This is because popular education is in elementary schools and not in universities. China is the opposite. Elementary schools collect treasures, while universities are free and even have subsidies. Chinese people who grow up don't know what's going on.
American universities also have graduate schools, which hold classes from 7 to 10 pm, making it convenient for workers, civil servants, and lawyers to enroll in graduate studies. Those who cannot attend can enroll in correspondence courses, but the credits from correspondence courses can be included in the credits required for a bachelor's degree, but not for a master's or doctoral degree.
In order to facilitate students in the city, each university has extension classes in the city. Those who are interested in studying a certain problem can gather a few people and request the local university to set up a class specifically for them, and the school will send a professor to give lectures at the designated location. The American military department has specially set up a military correspondence school, affiliated with the University of Minnesota, for the purpose of enabling conscripted soldiers to continue their studies while fighting on the front lines. The subjects listed are as many as hundreds, and the correspondence departments of universities across the United States are responsible for the handouts and grading. The handouts are mailed to the students on various battlefields on a regular basis. The credits earned are the same as those who attend classes at school. Therefore, most soldiers who have not graduated from university return after several years of fighting, and their university diploma is already firmly in hand. Therefore, there are many remote ways to study in America. You don't have to sit in the classroom to study. You can study while living at home, hiding in a trench, or in a submarine in the Pacific Ocean. University education is not just for experts, so it should be universal. Scholarship should not be accumulated and hoarded, and university education should be extended beyond the school gates. (8) National Strength Diplomacy, Bao Qing
The international situation is essentially a situation of power confrontation. If a country has strong national strength and creates sound politics, then it will be reflected in diplomacy, and it will be easier to grasp the winning ticket, and the speech will not be taken lightly. Otherwise, even if you are good at using strategies of vertical and horizontal combination, or have minor success, you will inevitably fail in the end. Therefore, today's diplomacy is "national strength diplomacy." If weak countries want to survive in this world of power politics, they can only seek to enhance their national strength, or use the international balance of power, or maintain neutrality, or form alliances with strong neighbors to seek survival.
R.L. Buell said: "In order to ensure their security, their power, and the rights of their people, countries cannot resort to law when they have no other choice, but must resort to their own strength, military equipment, and diplomacy backed by force."
