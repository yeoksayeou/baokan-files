Before departing, representatives of the people of Lushan and heads of various institutions stood waiting in the rain outside Gate No. 10 on the right side of the official residence. Considering the heavy rain and fog, the Chairman did not wish to keep the well-wishers waiting for long, so he instructed his aide to inform them that the plane had not yet arrived and the departure date was uncertain. The well-wishers then dispersed. Shortly after, the Chairman and his wife, along with Yu Jishi and others, left the official residence by sedan chair. The people, upon hearing the news, returned to wait and bid farewell.

Especially, the Chairman now wore a blue coat and mandarin jacket, further enhancing his kindly appearance. The Madame wore a dark blue Western-style suit and was full of vigor. Xue Yue, Chiang Ching-kuo, Zhu Huadui, and several others were present at the airport to greet them. The Chairman greeted them all with a nod. He then boarded a car and returned to the official residence. The accompanying staff arrived in Nanjing on the "Daxiong" plane five minutes later, including Yu Jishi and Cao Shengfen.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Chiang, also holding the title of Corps Commander, arrived at the Second Plenary Session of the Youth Corps at 5:30 p.m. on the 8th and delivered instructions to the attendees, the main points of which were: (1) Regarding the request of the Party and Youth League to change their names, he believed that the Chinese Kuomintang had decades of glorious history and should not be changed hastily. (2) After the unified organization of the Chinese Youth Corps, it would form a new force. Party and Youth League cadres should concentrate their efforts to eliminate the past bad habits of the Party. (3) He himself had not been able to personally pay attention to the training affairs of the Youth League in the past. He would personally provide guidance in the future, speaking with sincere words. The Chairman also emphasized: We must clearly recognize our goals, recognize the times, and the environment, to determine the methods of handling affairs. It must be known that we must unite our will and concentrate our efforts to eliminate the Communist Party and complete the task of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. During the Chairman's instructions, the attendees applauded enthusiastically several times, expressing their highest respect.

### Fourth Plenary Session and Joint Conference of Party and Youth League Solemnly Inaugurated; President Chiang Presides Personally and Delivers Instructions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Kuomintang Central Plenary Session was solemnly inaugurated in Nanjing at 9 a.m. on the 9th, the anniversary of the first revolutionary uprising led by the Founding Father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. President Chiang presided personally and delivered important instructions. This plenary session is the first important meeting within the Party since the reorganization of the government and the Kuomintang's position as an ordinary political party. Especially at the beginning of the implementation of the unified organization of the Party and Youth League, it has epoch-making significance in both political and party affairs. As the Party and government are unified, the attendees consist of both Party members and Youth League members, integrated in one hall. The purpose of their unity is no different from the past. The plenary session, which has historical value, was held in the National Assembly Hall, where a constitution for a century-long plan was formulated. The hall was designed by experts, with a combination of light and color, making it extremely beautiful. The entrance was marked with "Kuomintang Fourth Plenary Session," and the Party flag was hung. Inside, Party and national flags were interspersed on all four walls, with Party and national emblems competing for brilliance. The walls were also adorned with gilded slogans of unity and struggle. The atmosphere of the meeting hall was considered appropriately harmonious. Furthermore, the agenda of this plenary session is only attached to the "Outline of the New Construction of the Party" case. Other proposals that do not belong to the unified organization of the Party and Youth League will not have a separate proposal review committee; the presidium will decide to report them to the general assembly. The agenda for the next few days is tentatively scheduled as follows: 8 a.m. on the 9th, opening ceremony, preparatory meeting (election of the presidium and other meeting affairs); in the afternoon, Wu Tiecheng will report on the process of the unified organization of the Party and Youth League, Zhang Qun will report on politics and diplomacy, and Bai Chongxi will report on military affairs. Joint meetings of the Party and Youth League will be held all day on the 10th and 11th. The conference will discuss the agenda on the 12th and 13th, and the closing ceremony may be held in the afternoon.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Joint Conference of the Central Party and Youth League will be held jointly at 9 a.m. on the 9th at the National Assembly Hall, simultaneously commemorating the anniversary of the first uprising led by the Premier. The opening ceremony will be presided over by President Chiang himself. After the ceremony, a preparatory meeting will be held to determine the candidates for the presidium and other related meeting matters. Each provincial and municipal Party headquarters and Youth League headquarters has sent two representatives to the meeting. As of 6 p.m. tonight, a total of 201 people have registered with the conference. Together with the staff of the central government departments and the representatives of various provincial and municipal Party headquarters, there are more than 500 people. Many others are en route to Nanjing and will continue to register upon arrival.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 8th] Informed sources said that when addressing the Fourth Plenary Session, the Chairman will call on Kuomintang members to implement all possible measures to quell the Communist bandits. It is also learned that the National Government is drafting several regulations to protect surrendered Communist personnel in accordance with Article 15 of the General Mobilization Law, which will include the following: (1) Those who voluntarily break away from the Communist Party and pledge allegiance to the National Government will be granted freedom and full rights. (2) The government will not punish Communist soldiers who voluntarily lay down their weapons. (3) Those who are threatened or abused in the Communist areas and bring Communist information into the National Army areas will be protected. Those who voluntarily seek out Communist information will also be protected. (4) All Communist Party members should be subject to one year of ideological education and one year of labor service. Those who surrendered before or after the implementation of the General Mobilization Law, and whose actions do not harm the government, may be exempt from ideological education and labor service. (5) Surrendered Communist Party members should register with the local government authorities.

### Strict Review of Candidates for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Elections by Vocational Groups; Ministry of Social Affairs Cables Provinces and Cities to Prevent Abuses

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The quota of representatives to be elected by vocational groups in this general election has been announced. Regarding the selection of vocational candidates for the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan, Zheng Che, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Social Affairs, told reporters: The Ministry hopes that the National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members elected this time will be genuine practitioners of their respective professions, so that the opinions of each profession can be reflected in future national policies, fully demonstrating the spirit of democratic politics. The Ministry has telegraphed all provinces and cities, requiring strict review of the candidates for vocational National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members, and making efforts to prevent abuses. It is imperative to encourage genuine practitioners of each profession to participate in the election, especially farmers and workers, so as to prevent ordinary officials and individuals who have no connection with farmers and workers from abusing the system.

### Quota for Industrial and Commercial Groups

Election Committee of Vocational Groups and Women's Groups

Telegraphs Government to Expedite Decision

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Election Committee of the National Vocational Groups and Women's Groups Election Office held its third meeting at the Ministry of Social Affairs at 4 p.m. today. Committee members Huang Youying, Jiang Zuoping, Tong Xiaoyu, and others attended, chaired by Chairman Gu Zhenggang. The following important cases were resolved: (1) Although the government has announced detailed regulations for the allocation of quotas for vocational groups, the quota for industrial and commercial groups has not yet been decided due to quota issues, and the increase in allocation has not been announced, which has greatly affected the progress of the entire vocational election. Another telegram will be sent to the general office to expedite the government's decision. (2) The supplementary explanation on election procedure issues sent by the general office stipulates that voter lists and voting rights certificates are universal for the National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members, which is difficult to implement. According to the regulations of the two election laws, those with more than two electoral rights can choose one. Therefore, participation in the regional election or vocational election of the National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members should be allowed to be determined by themselves. If they participate in the vocational election during the National Assembly representative election, and participate in the regional election during the Legislative Yuan member election, the voters will inevitably change greatly, and the voter registration dates for the National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members are two months apart. During this period, the number of members and the number of groups change greatly due to the expiration of membership and the increase or decrease of groups. The two voter lists should still be made separately. As for the voting rights certificate for vocational elections, if the regional or vocational group is changed during the National Assembly election or the Legislative Yuan election, the voter should apply to the local application agency for a stamp before it can be applied. (3) The registration of candidates for National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members elected by national vocational groups and women's groups only requires the submission of a nomination signature book of candidates according to law, and the verification is based on the voter list. According to Article 9 of the Election and Recall Implementation Regulations, the voter list is made in duplicate by the competent election authorities, one copy submitted to the higher competent authority for record. The election affairs of national groups are handled by the election offices of various counties and cities. Except for municipalities directly under the central government, the election authorities are all at the third level. If the voter list is submitted to this office for record, the county and city must prepare three copies, whether it is consistent with the regulations, whether there is any difficulty in fact, are all problems. It is decided not to make another copy of the list and forward it to the national vocational and women's election office. However, for the convenience of examination, a supplementary regulation is made for the candidate registration examination procedures for verification. The methods are as follows: 1. When applying for registration, candidates for National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members shall submit their membership card and employment certificate in addition to the nomination signature book of candidates. 2. For those registered in the national vocational and women's election office, whether the candidates and signatories meet the regulations shall be listed separately by the office according to their affiliated groups and sent to the election offices of various provinces and cities for verification and reporting. For those registered in the election offices of various provinces and cities, the signatories who belong to this province and city shall be verified by the office itself and reported to the office. Those who belong to other provinces and cities shall be listed separately by the election office handling the registration and sent to the election offices of other provinces and cities for verification and direct reporting to the office. 3. The election office of the province and city where the candidate's group is located shall fill in the verification of the candidate's situation when reporting the list of candidates and add comments. (4) Railway, seafarer, salt industry, mining, highway, and telecommunications trade unions are trade unions organized without administrative regions. Their National Assembly representatives and Legislative Yuan members are all elected jointly nationwide. However, these special trade unions, such as railway trade unions and highway trade unions, are organized according to the respective routes. Salt industry trade unions and mining trade unions are also organized according to the respective salt fields and mining areas. This is different from ordinary trade unions. In addition to being handled according to the regulations of the two election implementation regulations and the election precautions of vocational groups and women's groups, it is also necessary to supplement the election matters to facilitate the election. The supplementary precautions are as follows: 1. For railway, seafarer, salt industry, mining highway and telecommunications trade unions, if the organizational area crosses counties and cities, the election affairs (including the preparation and public announcement of the voter list, the issuance of voting rights certificates, and the counting of votes) shall be handled by the election authorities where the branch or group of the trade union is located. If the organizational area is within the county and city, it shall be handled by the election authorities where the meeting place is located. 2. For trade unions that cross counties and cities, the branch or group shall register the members of each branch or group who wish to participate in vocational elections. For public associations within the county and city, the members of the public association who wish to participate in vocational elections shall be registered separately and sent to the local election authorities. After the votes are counted, a list of winning candidates and the number of votes shall be announced and reported by the election office of each province to the national vocational and women's election office, and the winners and alternates shall be determined. (5) The color, paper, font, and explanation of the election tickets for vocational groups and women's groups have been re-determined in accordance with the detailed allocation method of the quota for vocational groups issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs, reported to the general office for record, and ordered to be followed.

### To Prevent Smuggling in South China, Import and Export Commission Establishes South China Branch; Zhang Jia'ao to Inspect Guangzhou After Fourth Plenary Session

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] In order to prevent smuggling in South China and the evasion of overseas remittances, the Central Government has established a South China branch of the Import and Export Management Committee. The person in charge has been requested by the committee to appoint Zhu Huiri, a representative of the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, as the chairman, and Tian Dingan, secretary of the Fourth Joint Office, as the deputy chairman. Tian returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 8th to arrange official affairs and to ask the Central Government for instructions. He will go to Shanghai and then Guangzhou on the 9th. According to Tian, the smuggling of imports and exports and the evasion of overseas remittances in South China are like a tumor in the human body. If it is not removed, it will endanger the entire life. Recently, both the government and the public have attached great importance to this. During this period of fiscal and economic reform, the government should take active and passive measures to strictly restrict the rampant smuggling situation in South China. The South China branch is organized by relevant central and local agencies, and the Hong Kong side has also agreed to provide assistance. In the future, mutual assistance and promotion will make the import and export trade and overseas remittances return to normal, so as to block loopholes. It is also learned that Zhang Jia'ao will go to Guangzhou after the Fourth Plenary Session to supervise the implementation of the work.

### Japanese Compensation Factories; Demolition to Begin Soon

China plans to send a total of 223 people to Japan to work on the demolition.

### Coordinate with Saving Consumption; Seek Rationalization of Production; National Economic Commission Drafting Measures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The National Economic Commission is drafting a rationalization method for production institutions to coordinate with the saving consumption method. Minister of Social Affairs Gu told reporters today that it is urgent to launch a rationalization movement for production, but this work is not easy because China has never attached importance to factory management, and the objects of management, such as machinery and environment, have not been discussed, resulting in the failure of various factories to have the same standards. If we want to rationalize production, we must improve it from the root. Gu said at the end: I hope that this method can have good results. The reporter then asked for his opinion on the saving consumption method, whether it is possible to achieve the effect of the British quantitative distribution in the past? He replied that the method is very good, but it cannot be compared with the UK because all materials in the UK are imported from abroad, and the government has full control, which is different from the scattered materials in our country, and the British are ashamed of violating the law and uphold the virtue of abiding by the law, while China is the opposite, so there will inevitably be some trouble when implementing it, and I hope that the opinion circles can create a trend and improve this kind of accumulated habits to achieve the purpose of saving consumption. It is also learned that the personnel reduction and supplies registration matters of various agencies are being rushed by various agencies, and can be sent to the government for approval in the budget.

### Executive Yuan's 20th Meeting Approves Establishment of Post-Relief Affairs Commission; Continuing UNRRA/CNRRA to Complete the Great Plan for Reviving Agriculture; Patent Law to Take Effect on New Year's Day of Next Year

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang made the following remarks on the establishment of the Post-Relief Affairs Commission approved at today's Executive Yuan meeting: Because UNRRA/CNRRA is about to end, and after UNRRA ends, the originally planned long-term post-relief professional plans cannot be completed in a few years, such as the Yellow River Flood Area Revival Project, fisheries post-relief, mechanized farming and agricultural tool manufacturing, and rural industrial demonstration, etc., which have been established by UNRRA/CNRRA with considerable foundation. In order to complete this unfinished project and achieve complete success, our government has specially organized this commission, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and its significance is very important. A deliberation and custody committee is set up under the commission, and its members are in three aspects: (1) government representatives, (2) domestic elders with social prestige, and (3) people recommended by UNRRA or similar institutions run by the United Nations. This is not only an expression of our government's emphasis on the unfinished plans of UNRRA, but also a new method of international cooperation. It is initiated automatically by our government, and it is unique among countries that accept UNRRA materials. It provides an opportunity for donor countries to cooperate and assist in completing the plan within the premise of the integrity of our administrative system, which is a new test. The main business of the Post-Relief Affairs Commission is the great plan for agricultural revival, which is not only specially emphasized and promoted by our government, but also optimistic about by international interested parties. The main point is that when this plan is completed, it will greatly increase the benefits for the majority of the people, because this is not enough to talk about revival.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The 20th Executive Yuan's political meeting was held in the afternoon 3:00pm of the 8th due to the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session on the 9th. President Zhang chaired the meeting, with more than 20 members attending. The following is a selection of important cases for decision: (1) The Industrial Association Law was passed. (2) The amended Inheritance Tax Law was handed over to the National Economic Commission for deliberation. (3) The Patent Law will be implemented on January 1, 1938. (4) The revised organizational regulations of the Industrial and Mining Inspection Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs were passed and sent to the Legislative Yuan. The expenditure part was passed in accordance with the review opinions of the Budget Review Committee. (5) Flood control funds for Guangdong Province, (6) Additional repair funds for the Xuhai section of the Longhai Railway, (7) Henan Provincial Government's request for appropriation of bandit suppression funds, (8) The Henan Provincial Government's request for appropriation of student relief funds were all passed. (9) Special allowances for health technology personnel were increased to five times the original standard.

### Factional Strife in Singapore

— Special Correspondent Wu Jiatang of This Newspaper

— Fourth Installment of Post-Flight Notes on Inspecting Southeast Asia by China Airlines

Speaking of the factional divisions and lack of unity in various parts of Southeast Asia, Singapore can be taken as a representative example. Apart from the activities of the Kuomintang, the Democratic League, and the Communist Party, the fragmentation of the various dialect groups is so extreme that one almost feels completely bewildered.

After the war, the power of the "Malayan Communist Party" (MCP) grew daily, almost to the point of controlling the entire Malaya. The sole reason for this was that during the period of Malaya's fall, the Communist Party seized the opportunity to organize the "People's Anti-Japanese Army," widely launching underground work. As a result, they obtained firearms supplied by the British, and also seized some weapons from the Japanese army. Gradually, it became an armed and powerful army. Although the British returned to Malaya after the victory and repeatedly attempted to recover the firearms from the "Malayan Communist Party," the number scattered in northern Malaya remained large, and to this day, the British are still helpless.

Currently, the "Malayan Communist Party" has two external organizations: the "New Democratic Youth League" and a "branch of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army," which are led by the MCP leader Zhang Mingjin. In the early days of victory, during the period before the British had fully arrived, the "Malayan Communist Party" attempted to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to control the entire overseas Chinese society, even resorting to coercive measures to prohibit overseas Chinese from hanging the national flag, stipulating that they must uniformly hang the Soviet flag and the three-colored flag of their "Malayan Communist Party." However, the "Malayan Communist Party" did not expect that at the time, people's hearts were vigorous and overseas Chinese had great confidence in their motherland. As a result, they overreached themselves and not only failed to achieve their goal but also lost the support of the people. The "Malayan Communist Party" regarded this incident at the time as a fatal blow to their prestige.

However, on the other hand, in the last two years, the "Malayan Communist Party" has gradually raised its head again, taking advantage of the Labor Party's rule in Britain and the environment of democratic freedom. Their activities in various labor unions have controlled all the behind-the-scenes work. Looking at the recent general labor unrest in Malaya, it is all supported by the "Malayan Communist Party" behind the scenes. They not only propagandize for the labor unrest but also provide a large amount of money as backing.

However, so far, although the "Malayan Communist Party" does not have a newspaper, it cleverly uses the Democratic League's official newspaper, "Nanyang Daily," as its indirect mouthpiece. The "Democratic League," on the other hand, despite having an official newspaper that shouts loudly all day long, does not have any real power. According to general estimates, there are no more than a hundred members of the Democratic League in Malaya. If one wants to clearly understand how much influence the Democratic League has, one can get a general idea from Chen Jiageng's remarks. In a meeting between a reporter and Chen Jiageng, Chen Jiageng said: "Although the Democratic League has prestige and status, it has no power and can only echo others sometimes." Chen Jiageng himself is openly opposed to the government in Singapore. From his tone, one can see that the old man's opinions are stubborn, and he still maintains his subjective views on domestic politics. Although he returned to the rear of the motherland during the Anti-Japanese War and visited Yan'an, he still cannot understand the general political situation in the country.

The reporter once asked Chen Jiageng: "Is the factional struggle among overseas Chinese detrimental to the overseas Chinese themselves? Should factional struggles withdraw from overseas Chinese organizations?" Chen Jiageng believed that the main reason for the lack of unity among overseas Chinese was due to the domestic conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the domestic political struggle is not eliminated, overseas Chinese will not be able to embark on the path of unity.

Speaking of Chen Jiageng himself, although he still possesses the influence of the Fujian dialect group, it is far less than before the war. Some people, although they clearly know that his actions are wrong, do not publicly oppose him out of consideration for past personal relationships or because some of them are his subordinates. During the Anti-Japanese War, Chen Jiageng used the Nanyang Relief General Association as a tool for his political activities, even recently sending a telegram to President Truman requesting the withdrawal of American troops stationed in China, still using the name of the Nanyang Relief General Association. Now some people have pointed out that the Relief General Association is an organization that can be concluded after the war. If this name is used for activities again, it goes beyond the scope, and some people even demand that the old man disclose the past accounts. This matter caused a great uproar in Singapore at the time, but Chen Jiageng never made a clear statement. Although some people have publicly stated that the funds of the Relief General Association have been mostly diverted to funds for running newspapers and publicity.

In addition, let's take a look at the commercial situation in the overseas Chinese society, which is a scene of desolation and cannot be compared with the pre-war period. The main reasons are the fall in rubber prices and the war in the Dutch East Indies, which have become fatal injuries. At the same time, in this depressed scene, the cost of living is five times higher than before the war. Therefore, overseas Chinese are forced by livelihood and have gradually lost interest in politics. Although some people inevitably echo the left wing, it is actually just a "fashionable game." So, the conclusion can be said that the current real interests of overseas Chinese are all placed on how to obtain stability in life and how to revive their inherent economic position.

[Special Dispatch from Qingdao by This Newspaper on the 8th] The National Army launched an attack on Pingdu County yesterday. The bandits relied on strongholds such as Mataibao, Ligezhuang, Wenwang Mountain, Wuwang Mountain, and Zishan to stubbornly resist.

### The Asia East Association Releases Opinions on the Treaty with Japan, Advocating for a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting First

[Report from This Newspaper] The Asia East Association, which studies Japanese issues, held a reception for reporters at its Liyang Road headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday, releasing the association's opinions on the treaty with Japan. The reception was hosted by the association's director He Yaozu and the chairman of the publicity committee, Shao Yulin. First, He delivered a speech, elaborating on the association's opinions on the treaty with Japan, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) Regarding the procedure of the treaty with Japan, it advocates for a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting of the United States, China, Britain, and the Soviet Union first, and then convene a Far East Eleven-Nation Foreign Ministers' Meeting based on the decisions of the four foreign ministers. If the Soviet Union does not participate, China should consider its attitude anew, based on the spirit of independence and autonomy.

(2) Regarding the issue of Japanese territory, it supports the provisions of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration. However, from China's standpoint, it should theoretically advocate for the return of the Ryukyu Islands to China.

(3) Regarding the issue of the Japanese standard of living, it disagrees with the provision that the future Japanese industrial standard should be set in 1930-34, as this is tantamount to recognizing Japan's militaristic economic system. Based on the opinions of the people and experts, it advocates that the industrial standard should be determined based on the standard of living. The future Japanese standard of living should be based on 1928, the year Japan launched the Huanggutun Incident, and be appropriately converted so as not to exceed or threaten the survival of the people of any East Asian country. Under this provision, the Japanese people can survive and prosper, and the survival of the people of East Asian countries will be less threatened. There are economic, political, and East Asian collective security reasons for this.

(4) Regarding the issue of the Japanese Emperor, it confirms that the "Emperor" is the talisman of theocratic politics, and theocratic politics is the home of militarism. It advocates that the Emperor system should be changed. Even if the Japanese people are willing to retain its existence, it should be renamed "King" to avoid hindering the future of Japan's democratic system.

(5) Regarding the issue of compensation, it recognizes that the core of all treaty terms is compensation, so these opinions feel that the principles proposed for the compensation terms and the proportion of compensation China should receive are fair and reasonable.

He then reported on the association's organization and future work. After he finished, Shao Yulin put forward some supplementary opinions. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### The Ministry of Social Affairs Revises the Factory Law to Expand the Scope of Application and Improve Salary Payment Methods

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing by This Newspaper on the 8th] The Factory Law has been in effect for a long time, and much of its content is not in line with actual needs. It has now been revised by the Ministry of Social Affairs and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the main points of the revision are as follows: (1) Expanding the scope of application: Article 1 of the Factory Law is revised to "All factories that use powered machinery and regularly employ 30 or more workers, or factories that do not use powered machinery but regularly employ 60 or more workers, may also use this law," so that all workers using powered machinery can also enjoy legal protection. (2) Determining the competent authority: The original Article 2 stated that "The competent authority referred to in this law shall be the municipal government in cities and the county government in counties, unless otherwise specified," is revised to "The competent authority referred to in this law shall be the Ministry of Social Affairs in the central government, and the administrative authorities in provinces, cities, and counties." (3) Regulations on wage payment: The original Article 23 stipulated that "Wages shall be paid on a regular basis, at least twice a month, and the same shall apply to wages calculated on a piecework basis." The revised version adds "Wages that are paid on a regular basis in the preceding paragraph shall be paid in advance in the event of a rest day. When a worker is dismissed or dies, his wages shall be paid immediately." (4) Factory inspection: The Factory Law did not originally list factory inspection, so the following article is added: "The inspection matters after the implementation of this law shall be determined by law separately."

Editorial

### Leading the Nation to Self-Reliance

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (KMT) solemnly opened today in the capital. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek made a special trip back to Nanjing from Guling to personally preside over the meeting, demonstrating its importance. This plenary session is likely the last meeting of the KMT's highest executive body before returning political power to the people and implementing constitutional governance. The KMT's own reforms and the future political trends will depend on the outcome of this session. Therefore, the significance of the Fourth Plenary Session is already extraordinary. Moreover, it is being held today amidst a clamor for political and economic reforms that resounds throughout the land, making its significance even more worthy of attention from the people of the entire nation.

The KMT in China not only has a long and glorious history, but also has made indelible contributions to the transformation of China. Since the Revive China Society and the Tongmenghui, under the leadership of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the KMT overthrew the Manchu Qing dynasty, established the Republic of China, defeated Yuan Shikai, and recreated the Republic. Later, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the KMT eliminated the warlords and completed the unification of China. It also, on the day of victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, erased the unequal treaties accumulated over a century of humiliation. These great achievements of the KMT are immortal, and no one can deny them. After the victory in the War of Resistance, due to the Communist bandits' harming of the country and its people, the fruits of victory were [illegible]. Whether in politics, economics, or society, various terrifying crises were emerging. Knowing that without another sweeping reform, the future of the nation and the people would face unimaginable adversities. Even before U.S. President Truman's special envoy, General Albert Wedemeyer, issued his statement upon leaving China, the Chinese government and the public already felt the necessity of "self-reliance." Post-war China reached such a state that it truly was a major tragedy in the history of transforming China. However, what China's future destiny will be still depends on whether the Chinese Kuomintang can lead the people of the entire nation onto the smooth path of "self-reliance." Therefore, the convening of this plenary session is of great importance to the future of the Party and the nation. In addition to wishing it success, we would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to the KMT.

First, although the KMT has already made immortal contributions to the nation and its people, the National Revolution it leads has only completed two-thirds of its task. One-third still requires the continued efforts of the KMT. Although the Manchu Qing dynasty has been overthrown, the warlords eliminated, Japan defeated, and all unequal treaties abolished, the problem of the Communist bandits, who commit all kinds of evil, not only has not been resolved, but is also expanding and spreading. The situation at home and abroad has forced China to take the path of "self-reliance" again. If the KMT cannot use its past revolutionary spirit and the spirit of the War of Resistance to lead the people of the entire nation to advance on the path of "self-reliance," there is a risk of failing after nearly succeeding. Therefore, all members of the KMT should invigorate their revolutionary spirit, lead the people, and complete the task of "self-reliance." We believe that only those with a full and vibrant revolutionary spirit have the courage to fear nothing, can move forward optimistically, and can overcome any current difficulties. Therefore, we hope that the gentlemen attending the Fourth Plenary Session will deeply reflect when discussing the reform plan of the Party affairs. Ask whether the magnanimity of the KMT is still present? Think about whether those elements without strong faith in the Party should be removed? The KMT members are said to number four million, focusing on quantity over quality is futile. What is the benefit of focusing on name and reality is lost? Today, launching a large-scale purge of the Party, from whatever perspective, is truly urgent.

Second, in the future, the task of the KMT, in addition to leading the nation to embark on the path of "self-reliance," is also to lead the people to learn the habits of democratic politics so that Chinese politics can truly embark on the right track of "democratization." People generally comment on Chinese politics by calling it "corrupt and incompetent." Even Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng said the day before yesterday that the important task of the Fourth Plenary Session is to eliminate corruption, remove incompetence, and reform politics. However, how can this goal be achieved? We believe it is very simple, in a nutshell, as long as politics can be democratized, corruption and incompetence will no longer exist. However, looking at the internal organization of the KMT, it must be said that it has not yet achieved "from the bottom up." Until now, it still maintains a top-down approach. Therefore, not only is the Party separated from the government, but also the Party headquarters is separated from the Party members. Not only are domestic talents buried, but even those within the Party with potential have no opportunity to stand out. Recently, the call for "democratization within the Party" has been rising. When the Fourth Plenary Session discusses the reform of Party affairs, it should pay special attention to the organization of lower-level Party headquarters. For this election of legislators and National Assembly representatives, it should especially refer to the methods of political party elections in various democratic countries and effectively prevent KMT members from competing with each other, in order to establish a new democratic atmosphere.

Third, the KMT has long been asking the government to eliminate corruption, remove incompetence, and improve administrative efficiency. It is remembered that when the KMT held the Third Plenary Session in March of this year, it also discussed this issue. At that time, if the KMT could have resolutely reformed politics thoroughly, it would not have invited General Wedemeyer's criticism, making every self-respecting person feel ashamed. After this painful lesson, this plenary session should finally make a firm determination to truly reform and start anew with the people.

Finally, we must also point out that otherwise, nothing can be discussed. At present, the people's livelihood is in terrible distress, beyond description. The KMT should come up with concrete measures to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood as soon as possible, so that everyone can live and work in peace. It must not delay and indulge, sitting idly by as prices soar, leading to the people's misery. If the KMT wants to maintain the trust of the people, it should start with stabilizing the people's livelihood.

### Communist Bandits Fooling Refugees, Drawing Turtles on Clothes

### Hitoshi Ashida Suddenly Changes Attitude, Cabinet's Position Shaken, Conservatives Planning a Strong New Party

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida met with reporters in Kyoto on the 6th and made an important statement, saying: "The Japanese political situation is secretly wavering. It is said that the new party organized by Jiyuto Party president Shigeru Yoshida, if successful, will attract forty to fifty defectors from the Democratic Party, while I hope only fifteen or sixteen. If more than fifteen or sixteen participate, the Party will inevitably have to consider it. Because the policies of the current Katayama cabinet have run into a wall, the current cabinet has lost the people's faith and is in a position where it must relinquish power. However, the new party must have new policies and figures, and when the fate of the Katayama cabinet will end depends on when the new party and new policies will appear." Regarding the new party being planned by Yoshida and others, and its attitude toward the imminent peace treaty with Japan, Ashida also said, "I am also deeply interested." He also said that preliminary discussions on the peace treaty with Japan will be convened after Secretary of State Marshall returns from South America, and the formal peace conference with Japan may be held as early as next spring, so Japan must actively prepare before the conference, not only in political circles but also including economic and social issues.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Minister of Agriculture Hirano, who is inspecting the agricultural situation in the Tohoku region, said on the 7th: There is no truth to the rumor that the Katayama cabinet is wavering. It is also not true that I am leaving the Socialist Party and starting a new party movement centered on farmers' unions. This is a misunderstanding based on the idea of those who worry that I must now be fully engaged in activities with national farmers' unions and that other farmers' unions will continue to emerge, believing that it is not impossible to form a farmers' party outside the Socialist Party. The current political situation is very delicate. If the Socialist Party splits, the cabinet will definitely not be able to continue, and the political influence of the Socialist Party will be greatly affected. Now is the time when the Socialist Party should exercise the most self-restraint.

### Issue of Establishing a Korean Provisional Government, U.S. to Submit to the UN General Assembly, U.S.-Soviet Commission Abandons Providing Joint Report

[United Press, Lake Success, Washington, 8th] According to a report on the 8th, U.S. officials, long troubled by the Soviet Union's attitude towards establishing a Korean provisional government, are now planning to submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly, which will open within the month. It is reported that since the Soviet Union formally rejected the U.S. proposal to hold a four-power meeting on Korea here on the 8th, the U.S. has decided to throw the issue to the General Assembly. The Soviet reply stated that the issue of the Korean provisional government, which has been studied for about two years, "has not completely eliminated the possibility of reaching a consensus." U.S. officials believe that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission has not been able to agree on any fundamental issues and has in fact become a hopeless stalemate. Therefore, the United States proposed returning to the starting point and holding another four-power meeting of Pacific nations. The United States' request for the Soviet Union to reply to the proposal for a four-power meeting in a very short period of time is noteworthy, as the U.S. clearly hopes to receive a Soviet reply before the General Assembly convenes. Now that the Soviet reply has arrived, the United States can request the United Nations General Assembly to take action.

[United Press, Seoul, 8th] General Brown said: The Soviet delegation apparently did not want to reveal the fundamental disagreements regarding the organization of the Korean provisional government in the joint report. The Joint Commission has abandoned the attempt to publish this document, as both sides have many objections and reservations. Brown said: The UN delegation also attempted to withdraw "all factual statements that can describe the U.S. position and explain the main differences." The Soviet Union particularly tried to erase the reference material in the report regarding the twenty-four South Korean political parties that the Soviet Union believes are not qualified to be consulted because they are members of the anti-trusteeship committee. The U.S. suggested that the U.S. and Soviet delegations each submit their complete report, with a letter stating that neither side fully agreed with the other's report, to be signed by both sides and submitted to the U.S. and Soviet governments, but the Soviet Union also did not agree.

### Allied Headquarters Expresses Dissatisfaction with the Dictatorial Style of Japanese Labor Unions

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Harold, Acting Chairman of the Labor Relations Branch of the Economic and Scientific Section of the Allied Headquarters, said that some Japanese labor leaders have a "wrong idea" that workers do not have enough knowledge to plan for themselves and cannot directly elect their local or national union leaders. Currently, Japanese unions are elected by members to form a committee, and the latter elects the leaders. He wrote that many national unions in Japan still do not discuss with local branches and issue orders unilaterally. Harold emphasized that this error should be corrected, and the actions of national unions should be guided by local branches.

### Higashikuni Selling U.S. Cigarettes, Reaching 1.8 Billion Annually

[United Press, Karachi, 8th] As non-Muslims flee Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, at an average rate of two thousand per day, several incidents of Indian-Muslim conflict occurred again on the 8th. Two Sikhs were assassinated in their sleep at Keamari Port. Another two were thrown out of the window on a moving train.

### Egyptian People's Anti-British Sentiment Growing Stronger

### U.S. Plans to Use UN General Assembly Opportunity to Launch Diplomatic War Against the Soviet Union, Australian Foreign Minister Advocates Abolishing the Veto Power

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] A U.S. authoritative source claimed that the United States will launch the most important phase of its diplomatic war against the Soviet Union at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly. The U.S. strategy is to try to shift the power of the United Nations from the Security Council to the 55-nation General Assembly. Because in the Security Council, the Soviet Union has the veto power and can act without fear, while in the General Assembly, the Western bloc has a firm grasp on a two-thirds majority. U.S. diplomats will move unresolved issues one by one from the Security Council to the General Assembly agenda, so this General Assembly will become a turning point for the United Nations.

[United Press, San Francisco, 8th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, who is attending the United Nations General Assembly, made a statement en route through here, calling on "all members of the United Nations not to use the veto power and to restore the sincere coordination that is readily accepted. Unfortunately, the hopes of the people who created the United Nations are often violated, especially the fact that the Security Council cannot make decisions due to the use of the veto power, which is violated even more." Evatt recalled the harmonious atmosphere at the San Francisco conference and said, "The upcoming General Assembly should restore this harmonious spirit."

### Pope Urges Believers to Improve Religious Culture

[United Press, Rome, 8th] Pope Pius XII delivered a speech to more than 100,000 listeners in St. Peter's Basilica tonight, saying: At this moment, the opposition to religion has become increasingly clear, and Catholicism should take action immediately. After the Pope previously expressed support for Truman's speech advocating the establishment of a new world of peace based on Christian doctrine, he now condemned actions that oppress and persecute religion. It is believed that these words refer to the beating of a Catholic priest in Istria, which was controlled by Yugoslavia last month. Finally, the Pope also urged Catholics to dedicate themselves to improving religious culture.

With the assistance of President Truman's special envoy, Henderson, the two major parties, the Liberal and People's Parties, have reached a historic understanding after a week of patient discussion. The concessions made by both government parties have led to an agreement on a moderate policy. Greek public opinion, except for the Communists, welcomes this policy, while the Communists call the new cabinet of Greece a "democratic window of American imperialism." The concession promised by the People's Party is to agree to issue an amnesty for guerrillas who lay down their arms and promise to disarm right-wing armed groups. The Liberal Party has agreed that if the aforementioned policy of leniency fails, it may take severe measures to suppress the Communists. The new government's construction plan includes launching large-scale public works to absorb unemployed people and providing guerrillas who have been pardoned with a stable life. The purpose of this policy is to weaken the Communist Party's influence on workers and farmers.

### U.S. State Department Report Indicates that Britain Is No Longer One of the Three Powers, Communist Forces Threaten Western European Countries

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The "Washington Post" reported on the 7th: A highly confidential report from the State Department indicated that Britain is no longer one of the three powers. The State Department refused to comment on this report. According to the "Washington Post," this report from the State Department was submitted to U.S. lawmakers investigating foreign aid plans. The newspaper implied that this report may have been drafted by Kennan, chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Committee. Kennan had just returned from an investigation in Europe.

The report also said that fourteen European countries, namely Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Denmark, Finland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Poland, must receive external economic assistance in order to revive and resist the threat of communist rule. When commenting on Britain's crisis, the "Washington Post" believed that Britain must systematically reduce its military when reducing its responsibilities abroad, so that the Soviet Union's power does not suddenly increase. As for France, its pro-Soviet Communist Party is waiting for an opportunity to seize power. The French Communists believe that their opportunity has arrived after the European recovery plan fails and the United States loses its reputation in France, so Western Europe and France are now at a crossroads.

### De Gaulle's Speech Severely Criticizes the Soviet Union

[United Press, Bayonne, France, 7th] General de Gaulle said in a speech here today: The United States and the Soviet Union insist on solving the German problem against France's vital interests, putting France between two major threats. We would be greatly mistaken if we hoped for a miracle from the United States. At the same time, behind the iron whip of the Soviet regime, we find that human freedom and the independence of various countries are gradually disappearing. No one dares to predict whether the ambitions of the leaders will be limited in the future, but the serious threat to the motherland is made even more serious by a few separatist factions willing to be controlled by foreign countries, which is obvious to all.

### Electricity Conservation Measures Passed - Fines and Power Cuts for Exceeding Limits - To Be Implemented Next Month, Industrial Electricity Usage Not Restricted - Surcharges and Fines to Be Managed by a Committee

[Our Dispatch] The city's electricity conservation measures have been drafted by the Public Utilities Bureau in conjunction with relevant agencies and were passed at a meeting held yesterday at the City Hall Auditorium. Implementation will begin on October 1. The electricity conservation measures are as follows:

(1) For ordinary lighting and electric heating users, the standard electricity consumption is 30 kilowatt-hours per month (electricity meters under the same household name will be calculated together), with the highest electricity consumption in April, May, and June of this year as the limit. Electricity consumption within the standard will be charged at the prescribed rate. Electricity consumption above the standard but within the limit will be charged at three times the prescribed rate. For the first instance of exceeding the limit, a penalty of five times the prescribed rate will be imposed. For the second instance, a penalty of ten times the prescribed rate will be imposed. For the third instance and subsequent instances, in addition to the ten-times penalty, power cuts may be imposed depending on the severity of the circumstances. (2) For ordinary commercial lighting and electric heating users, the highest electricity consumption in April, May, and June of this year will be the limit, with 70% of the limit as the standard. (The charging and penalty methods are the same as above.) (3) For special commercial users who use one meter for lighting, power, and electric heating, the highest electricity consumption in April, May, and June of this year will be the limit, with 80% of the limit as the standard. (The charging and penalty methods are the same as above.) (4) Industrial lighting electricity will be handled in the same way as commercial users. However, large-scale industrial electricity users with a single meter for power and lighting may be exempted from restrictions. However, employee dormitories should still be handled as ordinary households.

Heating Electric Furnaces Are Strictly Prohibited

(5) All heating electric furnaces are prohibited, except for hospital operating rooms. Violators will have their power cut. (6) Once the above limits are set, they cannot be changed. If there are valid reasons, an application may be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Electricity Supply Review Committee for review and approval. (7) The surcharges and fines will be managed by a committee composed of representatives from the municipal government, the city council, the Public Utilities Bureau, and various electricity companies, convened by the Public Utilities Bureau, for the purpose of improving and increasing street lighting subsidies, offsetting losses in factory power generation, and reducing electricity prices.

Furthermore, according to Director Zhao Zengjue, the strict implementation of electricity conservation measures can save up to 20,000 kilowatts of electricity for the entire city, which can be supplied for industrial use.

### Unresolved Ten-Year-Old Murder Case - High Court Summons Gu Zhuxuan - Denies Instigating the Assassination of Tang Jiapeng - Handwriting on Extortion Letter Difficult to Verify

[Our Dispatch] The case of Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage, who was accused of instigating murder ten years ago, has been reopened. The Criminal Division of the High Court summoned Gu for questioning at 2:00 PM yesterday. On June 18, 1933, at 1:05 AM, Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World, was shot and killed at the entrance of the Great World. Tang was a protégé of Huang Jinrong. The French Concession Police arrested the perpetrators, Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui. Zhao was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Second Special District Court, and Zhang was sentenced to twenty years in prison. After serving their sentences, Zhao suddenly confessed that he was instigated by Gu Zhuxuan. On October 27, 1935, the Second Special District Court sentenced Gu to fifteen years in prison. Gu appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, and on June 26, 1936, the Third Branch of the High Court ruled that Zhao was suspected of extorting Gu, and his confession was unreliable, so he was acquitted. Subsequently, the lawyer of the French Concession Police appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that the Third Branch of the High Court's acquittal of Gu was insufficient in its investigation and remanded the case for a new trial. However, in 1937, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and the government moved westward, and the case was put on hold. After the victory, the High Court took over the puppet court and reorganized the old files, paying close attention to the case. Yesterday, the High Court opened a trial. Judge Wang Kequan took the bench and summoned Gu for questioning. Gu is currently a city councilor, a salt merchant, and 62 years old. He arrived in court yesterday wearing a gray silk gown and yellow leather shoes. When asked if he had instigated the murder, he stated that he could not remember clearly because the incident happened more than ten years ago. As for Zhao Guang's confession that he was instigated by him, he claimed that Zhao was extorting him and made false accusations out of spite, and there was a letter from Zhao demanding money as evidence. The focus of yesterday's investigation was whether the handwriting on the extortion letter was Zhao's. However, Zhao was released from the Beixinjing Prison during the Japanese occupation and was later imprisoned again for robbery, dying in prison. Zhang Tinggui left Shanghai after his release and his whereabouts are unknown. After more than ten years of turmoil, important witnesses have either died or left Shanghai, making the investigation difficult. After a brief interrogation, the court ordered him to return and rescheduled the trial.

### Prosecution of General Headquarters Corruption Case - Another Anonymous Letter Received

Signed "Purge Corruption Committee"

[Our Dispatch] A so-called "General Headquarters Purge Corruption Committee" sent another anonymous letter to the judicial authorities yesterday, accusing Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and others of corruption, dereliction of duty, and employing personal cronies. The letter was about a thousand words long and stated that the department had already replied to various agencies and organizations requesting the distribution of electric fans, stating that the distribution was complete. However, the department's warehouse actually had more than 400 fans in stock, and the retail department had more than 300 fans in stock, for a total of more than 700 fans. Because the prosecutor is investigating the case, Li and others are actively trying to disperse and hide the surplus fans. If the delay is too long, it may not be possible to investigate, etc. The letter ended with a seal of "General Headquarters Purge Corruption Committee" but no name of the anonymous accuser.

### Special Business Tax - Cannot Be Postponed - Request to Allocate Funds to Municipal Treasury Difficult to Approve

Regarding the special business tax in this city, the municipal government previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to postpone the collection until July of this year and planned to allocate 70% of the tax revenue to the municipal treasury. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has received an instruction from the Executive Yuan stating that the special business tax should be collected from May 1 of this year. As it is a national matter, the Shanghai municipal government's request for postponement cannot be approved. As for the request to allocate 70% of the actual tax revenue to the municipal treasury, it is inconsistent with the original intent of the revised financial revenue and expenditure system law and cannot be approved. The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau is instructed to handle the collection of taxes according to the law.

In addition, the Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau is actively carrying out the declaration work for the special business tax in this city. It is reported that various units under the jurisdiction of the bureau that are liable to pay the tax have begun to make declarations.

### Newly Appointed Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Kuomintang - Inauguration Ceremony Held Yesterday - Central Government Sends President Yu to Supervise Oath - Suggests Building a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Shanghai

[Our Dispatch] The newly appointed executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, as well as the executive and supervisory committee members of the district party headquarters and directly affiliated branches, held a joint oath-taking ceremony at the Great Light Theater at 9:00 AM yesterday. Yu Youren, a standing committee member of the Central Committee and President of the Control Yuan, was specially dispatched by the Central Committee to supervise the oath.

At the beginning of the ceremony, Chairman Fang Zhi led all the supervisory committee members to raise their hands and take the oath. President Yu delivered a speech, recalling that the Kuomintang had overcome all kinds of difficulties in the past fifty years. It is now facing a period of transformation, and all party members should redouble their efforts to realize Sun Yat-sen's principles, complete the mission of national construction, and promote the realization of a new China. Yu then spoke in detail about the revolutionary history of Shanghai and suggested that Shanghai should build a "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall" to connect the permanent admiration of the people. Subsequently, Mayor Wu and Wang Xiaolai delivered speeches successively. Mayor Wu encouraged all party members with three points: soundness, initiative, and cooperation. Regarding President Yu's suggestion to build a "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall," he stated that the Racecourse was an ideal location and that he was currently discussing it with relevant parties. In principle, both parties have agreed to exchange it for land in the suburbs. The details on the quantity and procedures are still under discussion, but he hopes that the "Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall" can be completed by this time next year. Finally, Chairman Fang delivered a speech on behalf of the representatives, briefly stating: "The number of party members in this city is already considerable, but we cannot be complacent about this. We must also have a sound organization and effective work, and play a grassroots role in society, so that we can live up to the expectations of our superiors and be worthy of being members of the Chinese Kuomintang," and so on.

Yesterday morning, the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense held a public trial of Japanese war criminals Takeda Matsuji and Asano Takashi.

The presiding judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the 15th. Asano was then questioned. The criminal repeatedly prevaricated regarding the continuous framing of our underground comrades Wang Shouneng, Dai Qingfang, and more than 20 others.

### Leader of China Textile Factory Killed - She Jingcheng Denies Shooting

[Our Dispatch] Liu Jilin and Li Zhen, leaders of the China Textile Factory No. 12, were shot and killed. She Jingcheng, chairman of the union, was accused of murder, and workers Qian Hailong, Wang Tingzhong, and Wang Yuansheng were accused of assault.

### A Piece of Identification - Points to Kerry as the Murderer - Defense Attorney Asks for Malley to Be Found Not Guilty - Judge Announces in Court That He Will Not Accept It

[Our Dispatch] The U.S. military court opened at 9:00 AM yesterday to continue hearing the Yu Shengxiao case. First, the prosecutor read aloud Malley's defense statement written on the 11th of last month, which stated that he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of August 1st. At noon, he met Kerry at the New Lizz Bar. Kerry asked him to assist with a transaction, claiming that the house at 571 Hongqiao Road was jointly owned by him and a certain U.S. Major. Now he wanted Malley to impersonate the Major and sell the house. He agreed at the time. Then, Kerry hired a car, and Malley, wearing plain clothes and a felt hat, got into the car with Kerry. At about 5:00 PM in the afternoon, they picked up a Chinese man at the Bund, who was later identified as Yu Shengxiao. There was no conversation in the car at the time. When the car drove to Hongqiao Road, Kerry first obtained gold bars from Yu Shengxiao and then shot him. Yu Shengxiao and I were sitting in the back seat, so my pants were stained with blood. After killing Yu Shengxiao, Kerry stopped the car, kicked Yu Shengxiao to the side of the road, and took me to his house, washed off the bloodstains, handed me the murder weapon, and told me to keep it a secret, saying that there would be a reward. The next day, when I saw Kerry, he said that the gold bars could not be sold for the time being, so he gave me $150 first. I did not see him again until I was arrested. The court then continued to examine the witnesses, first summoning two sergeants from the U.S. Criminal Investigation Department, who confirmed that Malley had been interrogated by the Criminal Investigation Department and that his confession had been transferred to the military advisory group.

Kerry's Wife Faints Upon Leaving the Court

The court then questioned Kerry's wife in detail for more than an hour. She stated that Kerry returned home with Malley on August 1st, after 7:00 PM. Because it was late, she did not see their clothes clearly. After the two returned home, Malley immediately went to the bathroom to take a shower, and Kerry followed him, which lasted about 50 minutes. At this point in the testimony, the judge asked about the situation of the two in the bathroom. Kerry's wife became angry and said, "This is a stupid question." She then continued to testify: there was nothing unusual in the bathroom. She and Kerry went out to see a play at 9:00 PM that evening and returned home at 11:00 PM. The next day, Malley came to visit. She knew nothing about the conversation between her husband and Malley because she was not there. When the defense attorney asked if her testimony was truthful, Kerry's wife burst into tears. When she left the court, she fainted, causing a commotion in the court.

Sergeant in the Same Room Proves There Was a Gun

After Kerry's wife left the court, the two sergeants who shared a room with Malley were summoned, both of whom testified that Malley did indeed have a gun on weekdays. Then Kerry was asked again, and he firmly stated: Malley's statement that he was responsible for all the expenses of coming to Shanghai was completely untrue. At the same time, when he went to Hongqiao Road on August 1st, it was entirely Malley's intention that he act as the driver. At this point in the interrogation, it was past noon, so an adjournment was announced. The court continued to open at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. The defendant's defense attorney, Bollekin, in accordance with Anglo-American legal procedures, made a motion asking the court to declare Malley not guilty. Bollekin had unimpeded eloquence and skilled techniques, saying that he had more than twenty reasons to prove that Malley was not the murderer. He then listed the main points, explained them, and said that based on Malley's situation, it was inappropriate for the military court to directly call him a murderer. The judge and prosecutor both disagreed, and the latter cited case precedents to express their inability to accept the defendant's defense attorney's motion. However, Bollekin still found reasons to support his position. Finally, presiding judge Colonel Palmer announced: the court does not accept the defendant's defense attorney's motion.

The Defendant's Side Presents Rebuttal Evidence

After a five-minute recess, Malley's defense attorney presented rebuttal evidence. The first witness was He Dengkui, a member of the Qingpu Self-Defense Force. He was one of the first people to discover Yu Shengxiao. He said that Yu Shengxiao only said at the time that he was shot by a foreigner. When asked who, he said Kerry and did not mention an American. The second witness was a Jewish American employee, Luo Qi, who had previously been deceived by Kerry's bad checks, saying that Kerry was a person with a bad reputation. The third witness was Tao Genrong, the chief of the foreign affairs section of the police station, who briefly described the previous investigation. The fourth witness was Major McLane, the director of the U.S. military hospital at the Broadway Building. He said that Malley's daily work was satisfactory and that his behavior at work was also good. He also said that Malley reported to him at about 3:30 PM on August 1st, but it was difficult to prove whether he had indeed arrived in Shanghai on that day. At this point, the presiding judge ordered an adjournment and rescheduled the trial to begin at 9:00 AM this morning.

### Hoping to Achieve Safe Roads in Shanghai Traffic - Traffic Safety Awareness Week Begins Today

[Our Dispatch] Today is the first day of this year's Traffic Safety Awareness Week in this city. In order to raise public awareness, the municipal government, in addition to having the police bureau increase the number of patrol teams to go to various major intersections to effectively patrol and direct traffic, the Public Utilities Bureau also produced 15 kinds of prominent slogans and posted them in various important locations and on vehicles. At the same time, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, Director Yu, and Director Zhao will all conduct special broadcasts. From today, all six-wheeled trucks (excluding buses) are prohibited from driving on Nanjing East Road. The Public Utilities Bureau has installed wooden signs with the words "Trucks and Vehicles with Six Wheels or More Are Prohibited" at the Bund and New World on Nanjing Road to promote drivers to obey. The relevant bureaus of the municipal government held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the publicity matters during this week in detail to ensure smooth progress.

Total Number of Vehicles is 260,000

According to a recent survey report by the Public Utilities Bureau, as of the beginning of July of this year, the motorized vehicles in this city included 8,876 private cars, 1,005 commercial cars, 3,464 private trucks, 2,889 commercial trucks, 2,841 motorcycles, 208 test cars, 20 test motorcycles, 1,328 jeeps, 2,073 military cars, 1,948 military trucks, and 105 military motorcycles, for a total of 24,757 vehicles. The non-motorized vehicles included 163,507 bicycles, 720 small carts, 7,930 two-wheeled bicycles, 17 private horse-drawn carriages, 63 commercial horse-drawn carriages, 15 horse-drawn freight carts, 10,985 pneumatic-tire freight carts, 14,697 iron-wheeled freight carts, 6,222 private rickshaws, 5,250 private three-wheeled rickshaws, 14,372 commercial rickshaws, 9,715 commercial tricycles, 2,191 garbage carts, and 6,171 single-seat tricycles, for a total of 241,855 vehicles. The total number of vehicles is 266,612.

Extensive Publicity to Reduce Accidents

There are so many vehicles in this city, the population has increased to nearly 5 million, but road construction has not progressed, and the width is uneven, causing traffic accidents to occur daily. From September 9th of last year, the municipal government designated the area south of Suzhou Road, north of Zhongzheng East Road, east of Xizang Road, and west of Zhongshan East Road as the central district and promulgated the "Measures to Improve Traffic in the Central District." Strict management was carried out on traffic, parking, and bridge traffic in accordance with the measures. The results have been good over the past year. However, because this management system has not yet been popularized throughout the city, traffic accidents in this city have not gradually decreased. According to police statistics: there were 183 cases in January, 209 cases in February, 197 cases in March, 209 cases in April, 224 cases in May, 207 cases in June, and 183 cases in July.

The "Measures to Improve Traffic in the Central District" have been implemented for one year, but many drivers and pedestrians still ignore traffic management rules, either crossing red lights or disobeying commands. At best, this affects personal safety, and at worst, it causes confusion in the entire traffic situation, which the municipal government deeply regrets.

### Difficulty in Achieving Marital Harmony, Forced Indecent Assault, Taking Out a Fake Gun to Intimidate, Girlfriend Jumps Out of Building in Desperation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Austrian youth Li Huimin, 33 years old, lives at No. 1, Lane 162, Jinxian Road. He is currently a bookkeeper at the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall at No. 2, Lane 70, Nanjing West Road. He had already married a wife in his hometown, but did not bring her to Shanghai. Living alone, he felt lonely. A friend, Cheng Qinming, introduced him to his cousin Chen Huilian (22 years old, from Guangdong, residing at No. 20, Lane 357, Weihaiwei Road) before May. The two fell in love at first sight, shared common interests, and often went out together. A month ago, Li asked Chen to get engaged, hoping to spend their lives together. However, Huiyun already knew that he had a wife, so she refused his request.

On the afternoon of the 5th, at around 4 p.m., Li went to Chen's house to invite Huilian out, accompanied her to Li's house, treated her attentively, and chatted happily. At around 7:20 p.m., Li asked for intimate relations, but Chen婉拒ed him. Li then closed the door, forcefully attempted indecent assault. Chen resisted with all her might. Finally, Li took out a fake pistol from the drawer to intimidate her. Knowing that she could not escape, Chen, filled with shame and indignation, took advantage of an opportunity to jump out of the window of the pavilion room on the third floor, injuring her head. Upon seeing this, Li hurriedly went downstairs to rescue her and was about to call a Tailai taxi to send her to the Sino-American Hospital. However, the neighbors had already reported to the Lujiawan Police Precinct, which dispatched Inspector Qin Boliang and police officers to the scene, who arrested Li. They then transferred the injured person to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries were serious. After investigation, he was charged with attempted rape, disrupting public morals, and endangering public safety, and the fake pistol was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Sichuan Merchants Couldn't Pick Up Their Goods, Shipping Company Sued

Yesterday, nine customers of Guomin Navigation and Aviation Company, including Lu Binru and Wang Junming, claimed to the Xincheng Branch Bureau that they had been embezzled by the company of goods worth billions of yuan.

### The Whole of Shandong's Industrial and Mining Center, The Boshan Mining Area Survey, Ensuring the Safety of Each Mine, Assisting the Resumption of Work in Private Factories

[Jinan, 4th, Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Zibo is the industrial and mining center of Shandong, covering coal, glass, ceramics, aluminum, iron, lead, silver, gold, and more. Of these, the first three have already been successfully exploited. Aluminum production also began under Japanese operation during the late stages of the Anti-Japanese War, and it was praised as the first light metal factory in East Asia, the reserves of which are not known. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the area has fallen into the hands of bandits three times. On August 17, the national army was restored for the third time. In order to understand the actual situation in the area, on the 28th of last month, the reporter and the news office of the Sui District Fan, Director Qijun went to inspect, passed through Licheng, Longshan, Mingshui, Wangcun, and arrived in Boshan on the evening of the 29th. On the 30th and 31st, they visited various factories and mines in Boshan after the robbery. On the 1st, they left Boshan and went to Xihe to visit the Yuesheng Coal Mine. In the afternoon, they went to Gouchuan to visit the Luda Coal Mine. On the 2nd, they left Zibo and went to Nanding to visit the light metal factory. That night, they passed through Zhangdian to Zhoucun. They returned to Jinan on the evening of the 3rd. On the way, they overturned once and were ambushed by local bandits twice, experiencing many hardships and narrowly escaping danger. The various situations are divided into sections for the readers of this newspaper.

According to experts, the total coal reserves in the Zibo area are estimated to be over 2 billion tons, which are divided into three types: (1) state-owned, (2) provincial-owned, and (3) privately owned. Among them, the state-owned Luda and Yuesheng mines are the largest in scale. It is estimated that the reserves of these two mines alone reach 1.3 billion tons, accounting for almost two-thirds of the total reserves in the area.

The Luda Mine is located in Hongshan, 3 kilometers southeast of the Zichuan Station on the Zhangbo branch line. In the 25th year of Guangxu (1899), after the Germans seized Jiaozhou Bay under the pretext of the Caozhou religious case, they began to build the Jiaoji Railway and the Zhangbo branch line. In the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), they founded the Zichuan Coal Mine, which was completely occupied by the Japanese in the third year of the Republic of China (1914) when the First World War broke out. After the Washington Conference, the company was formally reorganized into a joint Sino-Japanese venture. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923), the Luda Company was formally established. In fact, the power was entirely in the hands of the Japanese until the victory. The Yuesheng Coal Mine was originally a privately-run business, with coal mines in Xihe, Taohuayu, and Dakui Mountain. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), the Japanese forced it to cooperate. After the Japanese surrendered, the two mines were occupied by the communists on August 23 of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945). After the government negotiated with Japan, the Japanese army took them back on September 14, and the national army accepted the surrender and took over. However, the mines were occupied by the communists for the second time on January 13 of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946). After the national army recovered them on July 11 of the same year, the Shandong Pacification District United Command, in order to adapt to the environment, organized an industrial and mining management committee to manage all the coal mines in the Zibo area. The two mines were also included. On November 11 of the same year, the Zibo Coal Mine Management Office of the Resources Committee formally took over. As for the Yuesheng Mine, because it was originally a private enterprise, all property rights and debts are currently being investigated by the court. Before the court formally makes a ruling, the company still recognizes its production machine.

Before the Anti-Japanese War, the total coal production in the Zibo area was about 200,000 tons per month, of which the Luyue mines accounted for 100,000 tons, accounting for half of the total production in the area. The output was very small in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. From the 29th to the 34th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese were keen to operate, and the average monthly output reached 300,000 tons, of which the Luyue mines reached 180,000 tons, accounting for about 60% of the total output in the area. When the communists occupied the area last year, the demand for coal was not great, and the original coal reserves were sufficient for the communists, so the output was very small. After the Zibo Coal Mine Company took over, it actively reorganized and strived to increase production. Before the national army withdrew on February 23 of this year, the output of the two mines had reached 45,000 tons per month. On August 17, Zibo was restored for the third time. On the 27th, the receiving personnel arrived one after another. After detailed inspection, Yuesheng had no major losses and could resume work immediately. Although the ground transportation equipment of Luda, such as the tram lines and high-voltage lines, was damaged, and the equipment warehouse and carpentry factory were burned down, and most of the parts of the main engine of the repair factory were removed, the power equipment was fortunately intact. Mr. Ke Lisha, a coal industry expert from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, inspected the area and promised to retain the necessary machinery and materials. It has now followed the instructions of the Resources Committee to receive, sort out, and store the machines, and then submit a plan to the Executive Yuan for appropriation of funds. Boshan No. 1 Mine, which is owned by the province, was established in the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946) and was formed by the merger of the Bodha, Fudha and Leadha mines. Except for Leadha, which was destroyed by the bandits and cannot be mined, the monthly output reached 8,000 tons before the withdrawal on February 23 this year. When the communists withdrew this time, in addition to looting all the equipment parts, the mining machinery was mostly intact. After repairs and drying the water in the pit, it officially started to resume work on September 1, with a daily output of 200 tons of raw coal.

There are 23 private factories and mines in the Zibo area. Except for two mines, such as Huadong, which were maintained by workers during the communist occupation to maintain the livelihood of the workers and continue to produce coal and are still being mined, most of the other mines are preparing to resume work due to excessive water accumulation in the mines.

According to the Zibo area, the total coal reserves are so deep, and the output is as high as the military. If there are no special changes, it will not be difficult to gradually increase the monthly output to 300,000 tons (the original Japanese plan was to increase production to 8 million tons in the 36th year of the Republic of China.). In terms of quality, the ash content is only 12%, which is slightly inferior to the Zaozhuang coal mine, but far better than the Kailuan coal mine. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese army used this coal exclusively for steelmaking in the Kyushu Steel Plant and other steelmaking plants. If the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji railways are restored, in addition to the Jinan and Qingdao areas, the coal shortage in Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin can also be solved. According to the opinions provided by relevant parties, the current difficulties are:

(1) Transportation: The western section of Jiaoji is currently only 45 li between Jinan and Guodian can be open to traffic. The railways between Guodian and Zhangdian have all been destroyed. The original rails of the Zhangdian Boshan branch line have also been rebuilt by the communists into light railways with a width of one meter. Although the branch railway is now complete, the four locomotives that were used to open traffic during the communist period have all been destroyed. After several repairs, only one has been completed. The lack of locomotives makes it difficult to operate the trains. As for the railway materials on the Jiaoji main line, in order to complete the Xuji section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway as soon as possible, the materials for the western section of Jiaoji have not been settled so far. In particular, sleepers are in short supply. It is estimated that it can only be extended to Mingshui at most. If only coal is transported by road, the amount of transportation is small and the cost is high. Although the current price of raw coal in Zibo is only 250,000 yuan per ton (the current coal reserves in the Zibo Golden Zone are about 60,000 to 80,000 tons), but if it is transported to Jinan by car, it costs 1.2 million per ton, which is too expensive to solve the current coal shortage in Jinan. Therefore, it is generally hoped that it can be extended to Wangcun at least, and only 25 kilometers between Wangcun and Zichuan are used by cars. Only such a transportation plan can barely match the production plan.

(2) Expedite industrial and mining loans so that various private factories and mines can be mined as soon as possible. The state-owned Luda should also make official resumption plans in the spirit of surprise operations, so that the original 35,000 workers and 48,000 workers in Boshan (the total number of coal workers in Boshan) can all be able to settle down as soon as possible.

(3) Before withdrawing, the communists everywhere declared that the reason why the equipment of the workshop was not destroyed this time was in preparation for returning within two months to make a "fourth liberation." In order to avoid people from suffering and the local area being devastated again, before the local armed forces in various counties are fully rebuilt and strengthened, the government should send regular troops to ensure the safety of each mine and expand the recovered area, from point-line occupation to the control of the surface.

### Wuhu Approved to Establish a City, City Government to Be Established Within Three Months, Jingwu Section Road Workers Active

[Wuhu, 8th, Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The establishment of Wuhu as a city has been approved by the Ministry of Interior. The Anhui Provincial Government plans to establish the municipal government within three months after the Wuhu Municipal Preparatory Office handles tasks such as delimitation and verification of the population. The original county government will move to Fangcun Town, and the Sixth District Commissioner's Office will move to Xuancheng. This plan is being submitted for approval. The 100-kilometer repair project on the Jingwu section of the Jiangnan Railway has been active because 130,000 sleepers and 13 military aircraft have been delayed at the Zhonghua Gate Station in Nanjing.

They first released the prisoners in the old Yamen Taizi Prison, and then began to search for cigarettes, pastries, shoe stores, sock shops, paints, and sewing machines, losing almost everything. In the four villages of Liuan, there were small disturbances, and the order was extremely chaotic. On the afternoon of the 4th, our national army Tan division had arrived in the eastern suburbs of Liucheng, and another national army had also reached the west bank of Chuhe, and began to attack fiercely. A large army gathered in Hefei and continued to drive to Liuan to cooperate in the suppression, and the people's hearts were as peaceful as usual.

Now, I am willing to personally send my second son, Liu Jingong, to the Eighth Battalion to perform military service, and I implore you to approve the inspection and acceptance." It is reported that the Henan Military Region, after hearing the report, believed that Liu Zhongchen deeply understood righteousness, and his patriotism was the only one seen in this year's conscription. In addition to first issuing an order to praise him and informing the subordinates to know, it was also reported to the Ministry of National Defense for commendation.

### Rising Prices in Beiping: Civilian Life Still Comfortable; Diplomatic and Military Circles View It as a Paradise

[United Press Beiping, 8th] Although prices in Beiping are lower than in Shanghai, they have risen sharply in recent weeks. Tram and public bus fares have almost doubled, electricity has increased by about 25%, and coal prices have increased by 50%. Major hotels have raised prices by 30% since September 1, greatly affecting travelers. In the past two months, a 12% education surcharge has been added, and will continue to be levied. According to merchants, Beiping was formerly a transit center for goods such as furs, exported from Tianjin, and commerce was quite prosperous, but it is now extremely desolate. Although people acknowledge that rising prices are unavoidable due to the internal turmoil, the soaring price of coal is particularly concerning, given Beiping's severe winter cold.

Coal Price Increases; Electricity Conservation

The Mentougou coal mine was partially flooded by heavy rain recently, which is one of the reasons for the increase in coal prices. It is expected that prices will continue to rise after winter. Transportation difficulties also affect the supply of coal, and there is little hope for improvement at present. To conserve electricity, power is cut off in different areas every night, ranging from twenty minutes to several hours, depending on the location.

Rent Calculated in Flour; No Tips Taken

Some landlords, to avoid being penalized for using foreign currency, do not calculate rent in foreign currency but according to the market price of flour, such as monthly rent being equivalent to twelve bags of flour. One advantage here is that no tips are demanded for rent, but some landlords are imitating Shanghai people and require advance payment of five or six months' rent. Entertainment venues close at midnight, and a curfew starts from 1:00 AM, requiring special passes for travel, but most people go to bed before 1:00 AM, so it is not much of an inconvenience. People in diplomatic and military circles are happy to live in Beiping and consider being transferred elsewhere as unfortunate.

Abundant Food Supply; Inexpensive and Fine Wine

The food supply here is abundant, with a wide variety, and rationing is not implemented. Wine is particularly inexpensive and of good quality. Before Beiping was designated as the capital, ambassadors and ministers from various countries resided in the Dongjiaomin Lane, a world apart. Now, among the major powers, some countries that originally had ambassadors stationed in Beiping have not even established a consulate. Dongjiaomin Lane has been returned to Chinese administration, and former embassies are either left vacant or only partially occupied, while the former Japanese and German embassies have been taken over by China.

### Singaporean Representative Reports on Church Conference; Overseas Chinese in Singapore are Accused of Learning Chinese; Wu Yifang Claims There is Only One Type of Chinese Language and Overseas Chinese Do Not Refuse to Learn It

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th] The Far East Christian Education Conference held its fourth general meeting at 10:30 AM on the 8th. Chairman Hang Liwu announced the itinerary of the Chinese government's invitation to all representatives to visit Wuxi, Suzhou, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beiping, and Chongqing. Secretary-General Guo Youshou reported that the United Nations Education Delegation would host a cocktail party at 5:30 PM on the 8th. Then Hang asked Vice Chairman Guo, representing Saidi Ding, to chair the meeting on his behalf, and began the regional representatives' reports on the situation of Christian Education. Sarawak's representative Dickson reported that the region has approximately 6 million people. Aside from the British education system, the education of overseas Chinese and locals is very rudimentary and needs to be developed. Thailand's representative Seguan reported that Thailand began enforcing Christian education in 1921, using Thai as the language of instruction. Since 1935, children aged 15 and under have been required to receive four years of education.

Thailand now has 430 national schools with 61,000 students; 11,000 county and municipal schools with 1.5 million students; 1,600 private schools, with approximately 2.2 million school-age children enrolled and over 200,000 not enrolled; approximately 7 million illiterate adults (adult education has been started since 1940). After Seguan finished reporting, our representative Qu Junong and Burma's representative Yu Baluan raised questions about selling goods. Singapore's representative Nelson reported that Singapore has a population of one million, with overseas Chinese accounting for 70%, Indian and Malay each accounting for 10%. The current number of students in schools is approximately 40,000 in Chinese schools, approximately 5,000 in Malay schools, approximately 4,000 in Indian schools, and approximately 20,000 in English schools. In primary education, the first three years are spent learning the native languages of each ethnic group, followed by English. The Singapore government currently has an education budget of 3.5 million Singapore dollars, which will increase to 13.5 million after the ten-year education plan is implemented. After Nelson finished speaking, Burma's representative Yu Balu proposed that the language of instruction in Christian education should be primarily the native languages of each ethnic group, and English schools should also teach these languages. Nelson said that some overseas Chinese in Singapore are unwilling to learn the Chinese language, to which our representative Wu Yifang responded that some overseas Chinese are accustomed to using dialects and find it difficult to learn the national language. Chinese is only one type, and their learning of English in Singapore is necessary for commercial convenience, and does not mean that they are unwilling to learn Chinese. Burma's representative Zi Que also said that based on experience, teaching English from the beginning of middle school is more effective than starting in elementary school. Wang Zongjing, representing the Malay Federation, also gave an example, saying that Malay Christian education combines various ethnic groups in one school, with separate classes, collective games, which greatly enhances language learning and national sentiments. Finally, Hong Kong's representative Mao Gen reported that the Hong Kong government has not paid attention to elementary schools, with approximately 100,000 students, 80,000 of whom are educated in private schools, and the education system is the same as in China. After Mao finished reporting, the meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.

The first group was the General Administration Group, chaired by Nepal's representative Yu Shanhe, attended by Guo Youshou, Luo Ruisi, Ai Jilan (all from United Nations Educational), Yu Que (Burma), Jia (India), Seguan (Thailand), Nelson (Singapore), and Wu Yifang, Zhu Jingnong, Zha Liangzhao, Ou Yuanhuai and other ten people, discussed in detail how to integrate the Christian education system and administration with the social life of the educated. The second group was the Methods and Techniques Group, chaired by Nepal's representative Dik Hill, attended by Hu Ba Zong (United Nations Educational), Weins (Australia), Saidi Ding (India), Wang Zongjing (Malay), Bason Neal (New), Dickson (Sarawak), and Cheng Qibao, Xiong Zhi, Yu Qing Tang and other ten people, after the discussion on ending new teaching methods, began to study language instruction, and all representatives spoke enthusiastically. At 5:30 PM, both groups adjourned and collectively went to the International Friendship Club to participate in the cocktail party hosted by the United Nations Educational representatives. At 9:00 PM in the evening, they went to the Cultural Hall to enjoy a puppet show and Western music performance sponsored by the Ministry of Education.

### Memories of the Sports Festival

— Wu Bangwei

During the War of Resistance, it was felt that the low physical fitness of the people was affecting military and production, and calls were made to promote sports and improve national health. In order to discuss how to realize this demand, the Ministry of Education, with the approval of the government, convened the National Sports Conference on October 10th of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940], and passed many measures. In particular, it was felt that there was a need for a perfect law that would clearly define responsibilities and indicate guidelines to serve as a basis for implementation. Therefore, a proposal to amend the National Sports Law was submitted and passed. The Ministry of Education, based on this resolution, invited relevant agencies and experts to make a final revision in the wording, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for amendment and approval, and then forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. After three readings, it was submitted to the National Government for approval. This amended National Sports Law was promulgated in September of the 30th year of the Republic [i.e. 1941].

After the amendment and promulgation of the National Sports Law, the Ministry of Education assumed responsibility for national sports administration. In addition to implementing various resolutions of the National Sports Conference to the extent possible, it was believed that national sports was a comprehensive social activity that required a fixed program to promote public attention. Therefore, it was also based on: (1) the National Sports Law was promulgated on September 9th; (2) September 9th is the Double Ninth Festival, which coincides with the meaning of sports; with these two points in mind, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan to designate September 9th as Sports Festival, which was subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan. The first Sports Festival was born on September 9th of the 31st year of the Republic [i.e. 1942], and the Ministry of Education stipulated the methods for holding it, and the Ministry of Social Affairs jointly ordered the local governments to comply and implement. Since then, the two ministries have jointly issued notices before each year to remind the local governments, so that the Sports Festival can gradually become a meaningful festival, thereby influencing the promotion and development of national sports. Thus, this year's Sports Festival should be the sixth.

On the occasion of the sixth Sports Festival, I cannot help but feel something. First, the National Sports Law has been promulgated for seven years, but it seems that it has not been respected or paid attention to. Therefore, all sports undertakings have shown no progress or prospects. Second, thinking of the old saying that laws alone cannot be implemented, all sports professionals should redouble their efforts, be faithful to their duties, and further promote the effective implementation of the National Sports Law with the power of unity. The international situation is unpredictable, and we must not wait until the next time we are invaded to feel the poor physical fitness of the people and repeat the history of the past.

### Thoughts on the September 9th Sports Festival

— Zhang Zhijiang

Strengthening the country and teaching war are the top priorities of nation-building. Defending against insults and self-defense are urgent tasks. Strengthening the body and race, enriching the quality, promoting martial arts, and laying the foundation for national defense are essential. The Six Arts education, with equal emphasis on archery and chariot driving, cultivates cultured and virtuous individuals with superior wisdom. The supreme sage and philosopher promoted strength and perseverance, practicing diligently upon hearing the rooster crow. Let us carry forward our martial prowess and emulate the vigor of heaven. Pure and steadfast, we are capable of accomplishing great things. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings are comprehensive, emphasizing that self-defense is the most important thing in life, and that personal and national defense are inherently linked. Airplanes and artillery are certainly powerful weapons, but the effectiveness of martial arts is comparable. Specializing in combat, close-quarters combat, and night raids is crucial. In the atomic age, with the rapid progress of science and technology, invention and creation depend first on energy. After the completion of the Northern Expedition, the capital was established in Nanjing. Progressive leaders of the Party and state shared similar views. We established museums and schools to train teachers, expand teaching, and connect Chinese and Western cultures. The President advocated and exhorted us earnestly, ordering us to exercise and unite the country. National martial arts techniques, principles, and equipment are all complete and comprehensive, surpassing any gymnastics. He specifically instructed armed groups to include them as regular courses without hesitation. In 1936, at the Olympic Games, we participated but did not aim for the top. The honor we received depended solely on the national essence. Foreigners commented on its preciousness, artistic excellence, and deep interest. The struggle was solemn, the valor martial and elite, the dance dazzling, and the transformations progressive and regressive. These three major characteristics make it an unparalleled art. As a member of the first National Political Council, I also suggested that it is necessary to promote the spirit of martial arts. The reasons and methods are sufficient and specific, and training centers should be established in all provinces, counties, and cities. The highest national defense committee passed the entire plan, ordering its implementation. The teaching order was formulated to be uniform across the country, and all levels of schools should teach it. The experience of the War of Resistance proved that recruits were of surprisingly diverse physical fitness. The standards set by the Ministry were lowered three times. The selection results showed that only 20% of them met the requirements. The selection of air force pilots was even more difficult, with only 2% being selected on average. The recruitment process continues to be lengthy. Sound physique is a prerequisite. In summary, the above is related to survival. Promoting and promoting it must be active. Self-strengthening and race-strengthening are the foundations of revitalization, and self-defense and defense of the country are important for survival. Everyone fighting for themselves is what the times require, and the mobilization of all people is an unavoidable duty. May my compatriots work together to completely eradicate the sick man of East Asia's evils, and carry out the duty of publicity, so that everyone will be aware of it, cultivate the atmosphere, and constantly innovate and improve. Keep it in mind, train hard, and keep moving forward.

### Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, Officially Takes Office, Aiming to Eliminate the Foreign Exchange Black Market

[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, officially took office yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM. At around 11:00 AM, Mr. Chen, accompanied by committee members Xu Boyue and Shen Xirui, met with the local press at the Central Bank's conference room, and immediately released his inaugural address, which is as follows:

China is currently at an extremely difficult time. In order to seek self-reliance and preserve national resources, the government must impose strict control over foreign exchange. China's lack of foreign exchange is similar to the situation in other countries, so it is necessary to adopt a policy of thrift for foreign exchange expenditures on imports and other aspects. We must understand that under today's circumstances, it is not permissible for us to continue our economic life as usual. This is not only the case in China, but also in the various self-reliance measures recently promulgated in the United Kingdom, and the spirit of the British people in dealing with economic difficulties is sufficient for us to learn from.

Recently, China's international balance of payments deficit has gradually decreased. However, continued improvement requires our multifaceted efforts. The government is planning to find ways to promote exports in order to increase foreign exchange earnings, and hopes that it will have good results.

The work of the Balance Fund Committee is different from the work of the Sino-American-British Equalization Fund Committee that I previously held (Chen has been the chairman of the Equalization Fund Committee since 1941), because international trade almost completely stopped due to the war, and the current work is how to overcome the difficult period of recovery, so the method of handling it is also different.

Finally, it should be specifically pointed out that the foreign exchange problem is only a part of the entire economic problem. In order to achieve general economic stability, we cannot rely solely on foreign exchange policy, but also on the economic measures of other government agencies to cooperate with each other. Appropriate supply of daily necessities, price stability, and the gradual elimination of black market transactions are all the most important and indispensable measures. With the supply of foreign exchange for legitimate purposes, it is hoped that the black market can be gradually reduced.

However, the implementation of all the committee's work in the future will greatly depend on the cooperation and maintenance of the financial community and the public. This is what I cannot help but hope for.

Mr. Chen then answered questions raised by reporters from various newspapers, and members Xu and Shen supplemented the explanation. The main points are as follows: (1) The existence of the foreign exchange black market is not unique to our country. Even in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, and Hong Kong, this phenomenon exists. Eliminating the black market is the committee's main task, but many technical issues remain to be studied and resolved. At the same time, we hope that all parties will cooperate sincerely to achieve success. (2) The Balance Committee will strive to balance the fund's income and expenditure based on the two major principles of self-reliance and living within our means. (3) The source of the foreign exchange stabilization fund is mainly from promoting exports. Therefore, the government has decided to encourage exports, so that the proportion of imports can also be increased, and the prices can be stabilized. The increase in the quantity of exports will not make people's lives difficult, and the rational adjustment of foreign exchange will not have an impact on foreign market prices. (4) The value of Chinese legal tender has its own standard and position. There is no basis for the saying that it has a close connection with the US dollar or the British pound. However, there are currently more imports from the United States, resulting in a greater need for US foreign exchange.

### Market Transactions Are Quiet, Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Unevenly

Chinese stocks were even more depressed yesterday, with quiet trading and no activity. Various stocks rose and fell unevenly. With the help of increased capital for New Light and Jingfu, floating capital gradually turned to them. The veteran stocks of the Commercial Press were also in greater demand than supply. The three were the most stable and all stood at high levels. Huafeng fell the most. The new match stocks entered the market, but compared with before the capital increase, they were just so-so. Yongsha once showed a small recovery midway due to the absorption of Chen of No. 116, Yang of No. 125, and the young and powerful faction of No. 52, but the follow-up was weak, and it still showed signs of dissension and departure when it closed, making the trend difficult to be optimistic about.

The morning opening saw stability. After the opening of Yongsha, it was sold by No. 2224 and others to 238 yuan. No. 129 and others once advanced to 243 yuan, and No. 94 and others all sold. Later, it fell to 239 yuan. After 10 o'clock, No. 116 came in first, No. 16 also bought, and No. 35 bought a lot of spot, so it was pulled up to high prices of 242 yuan and 245 yuan.

After 10:30, the interest price outside the market opened at 16.5 points and 20 points. The market gradually consolidated. Then, No. 235 and No. 23 sold for delivery, and No. 97 sold for immediate delivery, forcing it down to around 240 yuan. At this time, foreign stocks were still firm, and people's hearts were still easy to cheer up. No. 76 and others absorbed them again, and they rose again to 242 yuan and 245 yuan. No. 28 and others sold off, and near noon, scattered buyers panicked, and Yongsha fell to low prices of 232 yuan and 237 yuan to end the day. The call price after the close was flat and tired, and New Light, Jingfu, and the Commercial Press closed at high prices.

As a result, compared with last Saturday's immediate delivery stocks, New Light and Jingfu rose slightly, Xinhe, Xinhua, and Qinxing were flat, Huafeng fell by half, Yongsha, Meiya, and Yonggong fell slightly, Datong underwear was also flat, the Commercial Press and Lian rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly. The delivery stocks fell by half, Jingfu rose by half, New Light rose slightly, and Yongsha, Xinhe, Meiya, and Qinxing fell slightly. Various old stocks outside the market saw a slight decline.

### New Light Underwear to Increase Capital Again

[Our Newspaper Report] New Light Underwear Factory is scheduled to hold a temporary shareholders meeting on the 22nd of this month. The important proposals are said to be related to the discussion of asset appreciation issues. According to information from manager Wang Shisheng, the increase will be three shares for every three held, or four shares for every two held, but this has not yet been decided. According to information close to General Manager Liang Jun, the company has drafted a plan to build a new factory, which will be built on the open space of the Tangshan Road general factory. A "newest-type weaving factory" will be built there, which can accommodate 300 to 400 of the latest weaving machines to be imported from abroad. It is said that a large number of building materials are being actively purchased, and construction will begin soon.

### Consolidated Bonds Are Stable, Foreign Stocks Turn Strong

The overall situation of public compensation yesterday turned from tired to stable, with various bonds experiencing different fortunes, but the process was still mediocre. Unified C opened in the morning at 14,000 yuan, with a low price of 13,600 yuan and a high price of 14,600 yuan, and then slightly flattened. Room 614 and others sold, and Room 503 and others bought, with a turnover of about 6 million. As a result, compared with last Saturday, A and B rose by 200 yuan, Unified C rose by 100 yuan, Unified D fell by 300 yuan, and Unified E fell slightly by 100 yuan.

The situation of foreign stocks turned strong yesterday, and buyers became more active. Yisha opened in the morning at 87,000 yuan and rose to 90,500 yuan before slightly consolidating. Securities gangs, bank gangs, and foreign merchants bought, while Jewish merchants, Guang gangs, and Jinhui gangs sold. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha, British Union, Weidefeng, Yeguang, Yisha Beer, Shipping, and Wool rose slightly. Paper, Steel, Telephone, and Xiangtai each rose by about half a percent.

### Rice Market Situation Is Firm

A total of more than 7,400 shi arrived in the north and south markets yesterday. The weather was cloudy and rainy, and the digestion of japonica rice was still acceptable, and the situation was firm. Early Bo rice was vigorously consumed, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. White yuan was scarce and the market was firm, and the scarcity of yin yuan made it valuable, rising another 10,000 yuan. The situation of new japonica rice is set, and the consumption of indica rice is still sluggish, with high grades being stable and secondary grades being tired.

The price of flour remained unchanged, but an additional 10% of foreign flour was added, which was implicitly tightened. Mixed brand flour and unified flour rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bran sales in the countryside were active and the supply could not meet the demand, rising in a straight line, adding another 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Soybean cake consumption was cold and the situation turned sharply downward, falling sharply by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories were all looking forward to seeing it rise, and customer sales stopped, and the change was very small. New soybeans were stepping up and becoming popular by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and Chen soybeans were also softening. Mung beans were slightly lower in volume, falling back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Broad beans had little arrival and sales, and the market situation stood still. Broad beans were not moving for customers, but there were still changes in the local street, and there were not many goods arriving, so the market was stable. Red sorghum was sold as soon as it arrived, with no breathing space for the time being.

Corn in the North remained depressed, and the South slightly accepted it, with no price fluctuations. Sesame had little inquiry from foreign dealers, and it was tired and stable. Raw peanuts from southern China were very tired, and the price fell by 10,000 yuan. New raw peanuts continued to fall sharply by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and wheat rose secretly, with little remaining and little arrival. In the afternoon, the factory sold large bags of bran for 85,000 yuan.

Stable Cooking Oil Prices

The supply of cooking oil has been maintained since the Bureau of Sales sold its inventory in the middle of last week and entrusted the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association to continuously sell it in large quantities on the market, and the market price on the morning of the 8th remained unchanged, no different from the end of last week. It is known that the association continued to sell 990 dan of soybean oil at 820,000 yuan and 1,200 dan of rapeseed oil at 740,000 yuan on the market yesterday. In addition, the Zhongzhi Shantou factory, on behalf of the Zhongshi Company, sold 65 barrels of raw oil (360 catties per barrel) for 1.06 million.

It is also known that Zhongzhi continues to maintain the regular distribution, and distributed 350 dan of rapeseed oil to retail oil shops from C No. 501 to No. 600 yesterday.

Flour Shipped to Qingdao

[Our Newspaper Report] The Haisu ship sailed to Qingdao yesterday, carrying more than 29,900 bags of flour, more than 400 bags of sugar, 1,000 boxes of soap, and more than 2,000 pieces of sundries, totaling more than 33,000 pieces.

### US Dollar Short-Term Treasury Bills Resumed Sale Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Report] The 36th year's US dollar short-term treasury bills resumed sale starting on the 8th. The sales area nationwide includes 19 locations: Shanghai, Nanjing, Peiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Xi'an, Qingdao, Hangzhou, Guilin, Wuzhou, Kunming, Haikou, Zhanjiang, and Jiangmen. The selling price is calculated based on the Central Bank's US foreign exchange rate in the local area. Other locations will be sold after receiving a telegram from the Central Bank headquarters. It is said that in addition to the three banks of the China Communications Bank, the Postal Remittance Bureau, and the China Trust Bureau, all other commercial banks have stopped selling them on behalf. The amount of 20 million yuan issued in September will be distributed to Shanghai for 10 million yuan, and the remaining 10 million yuan will be distributed to other locations for sale by the national bank.

Regarding the past sales situation, an official from the National Bank stated yesterday that the US dollar short-term treasury bills began to be sold on April 7th of this year. On August 17th, due to the promulgation of the revised foreign exchange management regulations, they were temporarily suspended. A total of 27,525,920 US dollars were sold, of which the sales volume in various locations was the highest in Shanghai, with 13,588,970 US dollars. The second was Nanjing, with 4,931,590 US dollars.

Regarding the pledge of US dollar treasury bills to the National Bank, it is said that in addition to commercial banks being able to use treasury bills to pay half of their deposit reserve funds according to regulations, there are no other cases of pledging treasury bills to the bank.

### Negotiated Price of Cotton Yarn Increases, 20-Count Yarn Listed at 11.2 Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper Report] The negotiated price of cotton yarn by the Spinning and Weaving Association was 11.2 million yuan for 20-count yarn yesterday, an increase of 100,000 yuan from the previous day. The prices of other counts of yarn were calculated proportionally.

Yesterday, China Spinning and Weaving Company still sold yarn in Group A and Group B. Group A sold a total of 788 pieces, with 338 application forms. Group B sold a total of 1,145 pieces, with 831 application forms. A total of 1,933 pieces of yarn were sold, equivalent to 3,113 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 1,169 application forms.

Stable Yarn Prices

Yesterday's cotton yarn market situation was initially firm due to the increase in the listed price of yarn sold by the Spinning and Weaving Company on behalf of the Spinning and Weaving Association. The prices were slightly higher across the board. Later, due to the completion of a large number of profitable long positions, and the fact that the Spinning and Weaving Company distributed a large amount, while the actual demand was still stagnant, the market turned soft. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn and 20-count Special Double Horse were flat.

Cotton Cloth Trends Firm

Yesterday's cotton cloth market situation was that the actual sales slightly improved due to the weather turning cooler. Local street purchases were not lonely, and customer gangs also had sporadic additions, but dyeing factories were still less active. The number of chips on the market was insufficient, and the market was trending firm. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth made a high of 498,000 yuan, continuing to rise by 8,000 yuan compared to Saturday.

Current Cotton Rises Slightly

Yesterday, the price of current cotton was stable. Yarn factories continued to absorb it, people's hearts were firm, and trading was slightly more active than on Saturday. The price was secretly better by 20,000 to 30,000.

### Rayon Stagnation

Due to sluggish actual sales and depreciating distribution prices, rayon lacks the momentum to increase in price. Yesterday, the market price for brands like "120" Golden Three Horses and Tianqiao opened at 25.7 million yuan, with the lowest price reaching 2.56 million yuan. Factory prices remained unchanged from last weekend, but buyers' bids were very low. Consequently, no transactions occurred for high-uniformity five-bundle thread, while only a dozen or so bundles were traded. Silk goods were generally firm. True silk quilt covers opened between 12.23 and 12.24 million yuan, with the largest transaction reaching 12.26 million yuan. The prices of Dacheng and Huaqiang were the same, while Huajin crepe was priced at 24,500 yuan yesterday.

### Over Seventy Silk Factories Registered for Autumn Cocoon Loans

### Three Chapters of Setting Sun

— Cao Guoping

City River

In the evening, I always like to go to this clear and wide city river alone.

The scarlet afterglow falls on the river surface, reflecting a light yellow wave of light, inlaid with apple green edges, how beautiful!

This mirror-like river surface, without a trace of ripples, is as quiet as the surface of the Sea of Galilee after being rebuked by Jesus.

The city river, carrying the heavy burden of the day, can now rest. No, it only knows how to supply, not to be rewarded; it only contributes, not wanting to enjoy. It enhances the convenience of cargo transportation, reduces the arduous steps of passengers. It also preserves the warmth, peace, and fraternity in the Garden of Eden, and still carries the auspiciousness of the Penglai Immortal Island.

Suddenly, a large boat loaded with straw sailed past, and the calm river waves immediately splashed up waves, rolled up rotating whirlpools, and the reeds on both sides were agitated and swayed不停…………。

The river surface returned to quiet, and this light yellow, continuous wave of light began to be covered with a layer of dark green...gradually deep, deep....

I only hope that this city river rests quietly and peacefully, no longer enduring any noise and excitement

On the way home, I could not help but sigh to myself

——Am I not like this city river? Unable to get a moment's rest, every worldly affair that passes through my heart will stir up inner pain, stimulation, and煩惱……When will I get安宁呢？

Always before the sunset fades, a crystal bright evening star with a faint light drills out in the western sky to say hello to the world.

Since I was a child, I have had a habit of loving the evening star, but I don’t know why, only because I saw it appear earliest and it is considered extremely large among the stars.

Now I find it even more lovely and beautiful. It is the light and sound of the night, it is the loyal prophet, warning us of the approaching darkness and reporting to us the power of darkness. When the evening star arrives, it disappears invisibly into the night, is it escaping the curse and claws of the god of night? Was it swallowed by the darkness?

Seeing the evening star, I also think of a close friend who sacrificed himself for the country. In his last letter, he wrote: "My current situation is just like the evening star in the sky. Although the dangerous and dark future is my only strong enemy and once completely swallowed me, I am doing my best now...

In the twilight, taking a cool in the garden, I always see the evening star. I thank it for giving me a lot of memories and revelations.

Bugle Call

The residue faded in the blue sky, and the bugle call from the military camp in the south of the city was sent with the習凉 wind during practice.

I understand that this is practicing the ceasefire call—it is沉东,激越,嘹喨—When it flashed across my fragile and fickle soul, this tone was particularly poignant, solemn, and tragic. It made me produce an inexplicable sorrow, hooked the tears of repentance, I felt that this had been蕴藏for a long time, just一直给世俗的瘴气抑退….

This bugle call made me begin to feel that I was like a soldier with a顧頷 face, a bleeding body, and a路躓step who was wounded and关来的from the battlefield of life. I felt that the joy of the flesh had faded, and the struggle of life had lost its taste. I feel that people who貪食"fame, fortune, power, and desire" wisdom fruit are always subjected to the permanent sword pain of the soul.

In the colorful and prosperous city, I am like a crazy wild horse galloping aimlessly on the broad塲, like a lamp moth that can never satisfy its desires, like an ostrich that always exposes its body and feet to conceal its sins, like….

Thank this bugle call, it once again gave me the opportunity to open my spiritual eyes, made me recognize the true meaning of life, and made me guard my soul better than guarding everything. But I am afraid of tomorrow's dusk bugle call, which is another tear-inducing agent of潸潸tears.

### Sartre's New Play Script

— Zhao Jingshen

The most noteworthy existentialist in our country, Jean Paul Sartre (1905-), has newly compiled two plays, which have been staged in Paris and have not yet been translated into English, namely "Morts Sans Sepulture" and "La Putain Respectueuse." Now I will introduce the plots of these two plays below:

"Unburied Corpses" tells the story of several rebels who were captured by military and political organs, locked in a high-rise building of a school, waiting for interrogation and torture in the classroom below. The authorities tried every means to increase the punishment, drinking and drunk, while listening to the noisy radio, saying some boring nonsense. The prisoners upstairs discussed a method,宁愿受苦, unwilling to reveal secrets, and everyone acted in unison.

During the continued torture, one prisoner jumped out of the window and committed suicide, and another prisoner was too young, and his sister was afraid that he did not understand the meaning of "brave", so she allowed him to be纹死. The climax of this drama should be the victory of the prisoners, and the words they said to the judges were all lies. But unexpectedly, the result was that the highest authority, Clochet, did not want their evidence and confessions and shot them all. Perhaps Sartre wanted to ask us: "In front of a tyrannical (Sadism) person, what is the use of these prisoners' courage?"

"The Respectful Prostitute" opens in a bungalow of a prostitute in New York. Someone accused a certain black man of raping a white woman. The black man asked the prostitute Li Xi (Lizzie) to prove that he had not committed a crime. She agreed to this request, but later broke the约; at this time, a senator deceived her, talking about patriotism with her, knowing that she was thirsty for noble people, and used this to fool her.

Later, the chased black man hid in her bungalow, and she hid him. But the senator's son, Hu Lide, wanted to ask her for help and found the black man. He used a pistol to hit the然人, but did not hit him. The black man escaped. Li Xi raised his gun and aimed at Hu Lide. Hu Lide persuaded her with words, and the conclusion was: "My father is a senator, and soon I will be a senator after him. I have the right to live. A woman like you should not hit someone like me."

Later, Hu Lide proposed to Li Xi, promising to give her a mansion to live in in order to pass the time. A black man was lynched (but not the one to be caught), and the crowd went home satisfied. This drama also illustrates the uselessness of struggle. Critics call this a light comedy.

### Feeling About the Preliminary Meeting of the Treaty of Peace with Japan That Is About to Be Convened

— Xing

Everywhere there are still ashes of thousands of households, who is it that arbitrarily advocates peace? Let him make strange promises of democracy, and the hawk eye often misses cunning建才.

The blood on Pearl Harbor is still初乾, but what can be done to扬意转安, how many冤魂沈海底, and then看握手话新缘.

受难当时谁最深, poor猿鹤百年心; 属齐属楚情犹昔,赢缕得缘忆欢音。

属国千载不寻仇, hearing that Wumen still has a楼; If 式绳人 comes again, I am willing to make Wu Yuan's头

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jinfeng

As soon as he walked to the bridge that divides the Special Zone and the "French Concession", Little Tiger suddenly gave Yaoqun a warning signal.

"I want to go and see the熟闹, Aunt Ji!" After the warning signal, Little Tiger suddenly made this request to Yaoqun; it was completely in the tone of a rural child.

"Wait!" Yaoqun stopped Little Tiger, and continued to pay attention to the pedestrians coming and going. Seeing that there was no divergent object, he asked Little Tiger: "What's going on?" The attitude was very 평담, just like a brother and sister chatting idly.

"On the road in front, I saw something like "出会" and "赶集", which must be very lively. They went north." Saying this, he lowered his voice: "You go find a place to rest first, and I will find you later..." He handed the two small parcels to Yaoqun. Little Tiger's actions have always been so rapid and resolute.

"Don't放野, come back earlier,...wait for you to have lunch!..." Yaoqun hurried to tell this, and patted Little Tiger on the shoulder lightly, and sent away this little beast hunter.

The bridge and the road in front are no less than three hundred yards away. Although the bridge is higher than the 평路, ordinary people would not see the detailed and clear dynamics of the distant road at a glance; at most, they could only see some people and horses shaking. Yaoqun knew that Little Tiger's eyesight was much stronger than ordinary people, and also knew that he must have seen something, so he let him go.

"North??...What is this place to the north?..." Yaoqun walked while taking the two words Little Tiger said as a key, hoping to figure out a clue. But because Yaoqun was not very familiar with the territory of Tianjin, he did not know that the French Concession stabbed the north was the "Japanese Concession", so he could not推想a reason for a while.

"Damn, whose descendants are having bad luck again!" One of the two shop assistants who greeted Yaoqun was dressed like this,咕哝; it was like议讽, and like愤慨.

"Let's eat more and talk less!" Another one spoke in pure Tianjin dialect: "Damn, what kind of world is this today? Ghosts may smear their heads in broad daylight! Anyway, we don't乱霎our eyes, and we don't多话our mouths, that's right...."

"...There are a total of a dozen people!" Again, an old man and two young people came over, a child in his teens, wearing an open-necked shirt and long trousers; some looked like Little Tiger's outfit, but they were much more neat; walking and talking to the old man: "Seven or eight young ones, like college students, four or five older ones look like teachers..."

"I saw that their hands are connected in pairs, and they are all拴着with iron locks..." Another younger child发表 his observations.

"That's an iron lock? Ha, don't let people laugh off their chins; they don't even know a foreign handcuff...."

"Walk the道儿罢, don't be so瞎撩,...we will definitely go to the countryside tomorrow, it's not good to待哪 here!..."The elderly man悄声低语叹息when passing Yaoqun.

The above five people's chats描画 gave Yaoqun a粗技大叶轮廓of the "incident" scenery line on the road just now. The more he moved forward, the more參老information he collected; he used these data to拼凑 into a tragedy, which was probably the matter of Little Tiger chasing紫.

### Roadside

— Li Weichu

I often think like this——that may be a subconsciousness, once "When today passes, if I can no longer calculate the days of tomorrow in my mind, or if I can't count the estimates for the next month in this month, I will be relaxed." However, in fact, there is always a kind of worry deeply pressing on my heart, and there is always a shadow tightly following; it is not scary, but the consciousness clearly and transcendentally stands outside the material life, and calls to raise the spirit above the actual life; but occasionally I hear one or two sentences that the things have漲,——this is really a serious threat to the burden of my salary for a family of four.——Therefore, it forms my state of opposition between spirit and matter. I cannot surpass the influence and stimulation of this actual life on the spirit!

As usual, this is a beautiful dusk, the shallow light of the setting sun softly shines on the road. It's time to get off work, I chose to walk in the shade on the roadside, a person with a broken leg and残肢is begging on the roadside with a harsh cry. This is a tragic scene. Usually, when these people stretch out their hands to beg, I can't bear to let them shrink back empty-handed. If it is an old beggar, I will feel even more sad and unbearable. Although I am not a humanitarian, the so-called "惻隱之心,人皆有之". Maybe I can only weakly give this useless sympathy.

But now, there are too many unfortunate events, and people's sympathy is gradually thinning and淡渺; after that, I gradually learn to be忍心, and when facing凄凉and misfortune, I also learn to be毫不动情; watching them stretch out their begging hands, I run away quickly, escaping their begging. At first, sometimes I would feel sad and ashamed, and vaguely be condemned by my conscience, thinking that I had堕落and learned badly. But after a long time, I became习以为常, and this emotion gradually disappeared, and there would be no more voices in my heart to責備. If there is, at that time, the brilliance of the soul is the most bright……

Because of these kinds of thoughts rising and falling in my mind, my pace became slow. Not far from the front, there was a group of people圍, and looking again, there was a pool of bright red blood flowing on the ground. I thought it was a rickshaw that had been overturned, and a car had injured someone again; but, no, the bright red blood made me very afraid, I dare not look, but the more I dare not look, the more the curiosity in my heart is加倍鼓动, so I walked over. When I arrived in that crowd, I saw that it was a middle-aged poor woman sitting in that pool of blood as if in a coma.——I dare not look at that extremely painful face; this scene made me feel palpitations immediately, blood, the bright red blood made my hands and feet酥软. I heard someone whispering quietly:

"She walked here, and the stomach pain started to be利害, and she couldn't walk anymore."

"Is she about to give birth"? Another woman in her thirties with淸秀features frowned and said.

I immediately退出来, picked a kind-looking face and asked: "Why didn't anyone send her to the hospital"?

"Someone reported it, I'm afraid it will be here in a while." Coincidentally, this is also a northern accent.

I didn't ask another question, and didn't dare to look more, although I seemed to really want to stay here for a while to see if someone would come and send her to the hospital. But at that time, it seemed that I was very sad in my heart, and my mood was very heavy, and I couldn't stand there for a while longer. Like a patient, I dragged my heavy steps and walked away. Although I had a pool of tears in my eyes, I silently blessed this woman who was giving birth on the roadside, and at the same time silently wished for the birth of this baby. When he grew up, decades later he should know that his mother gave birth to him on the roadside; he should remember his mother, remember this road. After he knows all this, what should娜he do? What kind of person should he be?

I thought silently, my thoughts were煩乱and紛纭.

After I went home that night, I was always silent? My thoughts and feelings are serious and heavy. My mother still thought that I had something unpleasant in the office, but I only gave a slight苦笑, and could not explain. Because for this era, this society, the ways of life and situations of all kinds of people, the great suffering of this crowd, there are really too many things that need to be explained,——I can only be silent.

### Night Sky

— Shi Hong

Every day, I long for the dusk to sprinkle from the gaps in the locust leaves. I want to lean on the window, and whisper to the starry sky.

On the moonlit and wind清之night, the stars appeared from the sky. Clustered together, the dresses studded with coral beads shimmered, like going to a night party on a beach. Polaris is the host, and Ursa Major is his giant兕. He is drunk, the starlight shimmers, like an endearing smile after drinking, like beautiful and hazy drunk eyes.

A strip of silver-white light, flowing through央in the sky, this is the Milky Way. On both sides of it, there are more densely sitting groups of dazzling stars; is it to临淸流and濯足after酒酣耳热, or to曲水流觞, imitate the charming things of the world?

An arc of light劃过天空, and a star is seen falling in the world. Is it because the daughters are娇力弱, unable to胜酒后的恣情狂笑, and香消玉殒? Or is he amorous and放浪, so that he has violated the heavenly rules and was謫to the world?

All this, I don't want to know, isn't a question that doesn't seek an answer more complete. I leaned on the window, but I heard their soft whispers and laughter, and struck the festival and sang. My heart was飄飘忽忽牵引得悠远又悠远, as if it was gradually merging with them.

So, I opened the mysterious book of the universe,体染伟大和渺小, short and eternal, the existing meaning of life.

Until the hunter星魁伟地appearances, the host of the night party said goodbye to the guests one by one, with倦怠和兴奋, and made a plan for the next day's meeting. The hunter star is the servant who专门司 and 除残餚, right?

The morning star讥诮 from the branches of the locust tree, and关了 the window. I shared the intoxication, just like I just came back from a strange banquet.

### Words for "Sports Festival"

— Cai Zhiwei

Today is Sports Day.

On the personal side, if you want to develop your career, you must make your body healthy; on the national side, if you want to strengthen the country, the people must be healthy. The so-called strengthening the body can strengthen the species, and then step into the road of strengthening the country, which lies in this.

Although schools in Shanghai are very发达, there are still many schools that use lane houses as school buildings and do not have sports塲. This is a serious problem. Shanghai sports人土should come up with a way, such as several schools sharing a sports塲, so that the general youth and children have the opportunity to锻炼体格. In order to bring Shanghai school sports into正轨, the education authorities should give guidance and assistance. The teaching materials of school sports should also be researched and discussed for improvement.

At present, there are two major problems in the Shanghai sports world that need to be solved:

(1) Talent个题: There used to be a large number of sports talents in Shanghai, but some are now tired of work, and some have retired due to old age. Due to the development of schools, sports teachers, if calculated as two in middle schools and one in primary schools, also need thousands of sports teachers. Moreover, folk groups need a large number of sports guidance talents, so Shanghai is even more lacking in sports talents. For the sake of Shanghai sports, the municipal government should set up more special physical education schools and reward the establishment of private special physical education schools to cultivate talents to solve the panic of talents.

(2) Funding issues: The old saying goes, "A clever woman can't cook without rice." Although the Shanghai sports world has a good system and plan, it often cannot engage in development due to insufficient funding. Therefore, the government should include national sports funding in the budget and allocate it reasonably. If the Shanghai sports world has sufficient financial resources, it will be able to enrich sports facilities and develop sports undertakings. In a few years, Shanghai's sports will be able to develop to an ideal state.

As for. Other塲地设备 and other issues are all related to economic issues, and there is no need to赘言.

### On Nurseries

— Yu Shan

— A Call for the You You Nursery

When people eat a tree's abundant fruit, they only know its sweetness but don't think of the planter's hard work. When a child grows up, becoming a certain kind of person, some parents don't even realize it's their own responsibility. Fortunately, the nation has established nurseries and childcare centers! If every center could take on this important mission, it might still not feel like enough capacity, especially since some centers are nothing more than trophies for ordinary ladies to show off their vanity! This is not only something everyone should pay attention to, but it is indeed a crucial and unique mission for the nation's prosperity and women's liberation.

Have I not also often neglected my children's care because I need to work to earn a living? Thinking about their urgent need to be placed in a suitable home in the future, I visited many centers before finally finding them a sweet and quiet home: the newly established You You Nursery, which has been open for less than a year, is their temporary hometown. Due to space limitations, it can only accommodate eighty children. The healthy and lively demeanor of each child is enough to prove that the founder has accomplished this great mission. The children can eat five meals a day, including fruits, milk, and eggs, which is especially rare. What's even more commendable is that every time I visit, I see the director, Ms. Ye Shuke, personally supervising the children's daily lives. Recently, they even hired an expert in child psychology to help her take care of everything in the center. They are constantly and humbly researching methods of childcare. The nannies and staff in the center are all kind and amiable. The only shortcoming is that Ms. Ye is struggling to raise funds for this little paradise. There are still more than twenty registered children who cannot enter because the house is too small; this paradise is just a three-story building. In terms of finances, it has not received any subsidies from any organizations. However, the fees for children's food and lodging are extremely low. Among the eighty children, some are even free of charge. There is a child without a father, whose mother is unemployed and sick; she has not only not paid for food and lodging for three or four months, but even her clothes are provided by the center. I once held that pitiful child. She was chubby and very cute, and she talked and laughed with me.

Therefore, due to these urgent needs, the You You Nursery's board of directors, including Chairman Song Ying, wife of Shang Zhen, as well as Mr. Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, and Chen Qicai, are working together to lead and assist in preparing a charity performance at the Golden Theatre in mid-month to raise funds. I am deeply moved by Ms. Ye's compassionate and great spirit of service, and I deeply feel the profound significance of this matter. I wish the You You Nursery and the more than twenty registered children a bright future. I hope that this charity performance will receive enthusiastic support and assistance from all sectors!

### Illegal Late-Night Business

— Excerpt from this newspaper, August 25th, Guangxu 19th year

The police station has restrictions on the operating hours of entertainment venues, but there are still lawless individuals who secretly extend the time. If the police station discovers this, they will be punished accordingly. It was found that similar incidents occurred fifty years ago, but not in dance halls, but in opium dens.

"Each opium den inside and outside the city of this county must close at 9 p.m. and shut its doors at 10 p.m. This is a fixed rule, and violations will be investigated. Zhou Sanfu and others opened an opium den in Yangjia Ferry Lane in the southern part of Shanghai, which was lit up late at night. It was discovered by the Baojia Chief Inspector Zhang Sima. Therefore, the previous night, he took Jia Yong to investigate and found that Zhou and Wang Yousheng, Yao Pinshan, Luo Changsheng, and Qiu Xiangyun, among others, had not yet closed their businesses. The bureau was immediately ordered to bring Zhou and the other five people, as well as their doorplates, back. The bureau interrogated them, and Zhou and the others kowtowed and begged for mercy. Sima said: 'The doorplates should have been revoked, but considering that it is the first offense, leniency will be granted.' The doorplates were returned separately, and Zhou and the others were severely reprimanded, and they were asked to provide written guarantees for the record."

### The 1948 World Olympic Games

— Translated by Baishi

Apart from Germany and Japan, all the countries in the world have received invitations from the "Preparatory Committee of the 14th World Olympic Games" to participate in the grand event that will be held in London from July 29th to August 14th, 1948.

Although the Games are still a year away, many members of the preparatory committee have already started working in London. In the summer of 1948, the British mainland will inevitably be affected by the post-war scarcity of materials, but the British government has decided to provide the "best of everything" to the approximately five thousand athletes and officials.

The stadiums for various competitions have already been prepared. The "Wembley Stadium" in the northwest of Greater London, which is the best outdoor competition venue in Britain, is now constructing hundreds of dressing rooms with comfortable facilities such as showers and hot water faucets. In the coming year, a brand-new outdoor swimming pool, many new parks and parking lots, a "stretch the muscles" practice track, and a new avenue leading to the stadium will be built.

Under the leadership of Sir Arthur Elvin, "Wembley Stadium" is preparing for various events in a very thorough and seamless manner. It will allow 100,000 spectators to watch all the competitions with satisfaction. Near the "Imperial Pool," a boxing ring will be built; once the boxing program is over, a large number of skilled workers will dismantle the ring and prepare the swimming pool almost overnight.

Various competitions that are not suitable for "Wembley" will use other world-renowned outdoor sports venues. For example, rowing - participants must bring their own canoes - will be held on the "Henley Regatta" river; cycling will be held on the famous "Herne Hill Velodrome" in south London, and shooting competitions will be held in "Bisley". A first-class gymnasium that can accommodate at least 300 basketball players has not yet been found; and wrestling competitions also have their special problems, because the size of the mats stipulated by the World Games is not produced in Britain.

Finally, let's talk about preparing the "Olympia Torch". The fuel research department of the organizing committee is designing to use a huge magnifying glass to concentrate the sun's rays on Mount Olympus in northern Greece to light a torch. Regardless of wind or rain, day or night, this torch will be "carried by athletes from various countries in a relay race, passing through Europe, and arriving at "Wembley Stadium" on the opening day of the Games to light the "Olympia Flame" - this flame will be visible to all spectators and athletes day and night during the Games.

Note: Due to today's crowded manuscripts, "American Miscellany" will be suspended for one day.

### Film Scene This Week

Clumsy Spy Film "Thorny Rose"

If you have a good memory, you will still remember the film "Spring River Regret," which promoted the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere during the occupation period, which was co-directed by Yue Feng and the enemy.

The director of this "Thorny Rose" is Yue Feng.

If we still admit that movies are weapons for educating the public, then what impact will the films directed by the same person, from "Spring River Regret" to the current "Thorny Rose," have on the audience? Is the movie really dark?

Let's look at this "Thorny Rose" again. It depicts the story of Chongqing's intelligence personnel and the puppet regime's special agents. However, due to the fictitious nature of the story and the lack of reality in the content, the male protagonist, Lu Jialiang, defected from Chongqing's intelligence personnel to the puppet side's special agent, Guan Ziwansanye, without any process, making it difficult for people to understand. Finally, Li Jingdan sneaked into Wan's mansion for two nights to throw bombs, which was completely fantasy and child's play. In short, it is a clumsy spy drama.

Actors: Luo Lan's first time on the screen, this achievement is extremely rare; Yan Hua is excessive and impetuous.

The Ups and Downs of a Female Performer—"Tianqiao"

This play depicts the ups and downs of a female performer. Through the life of the female performer Hua Xiaofeng, the author outlines the darkness of this society. However, because the author used too many and mixed materials, it could not be focused, and the story was too long, from before the war to after the war. This includes praising the loyalty of the old performer Mu Hongchun, the steadfastness of some old opera performers, the lawlessness of local gangsters, collusion with the enemy and puppets, Hua Xiaofeng's deception and escape, and finally her downfall. However, these are only superficial descriptions in the author's pen, and they have not been explored in depth, so they cannot leave a deep impression on the audience.

The director's handling of the play is difficult to explain, but it seems powerless. Those Peking opera scenes are both rigid and boring, and the understanding of the play is also superficial, only moving the clear and smooth play to the stage. This is a craftsman rather than an artist.

Du Zhu's first time on the screen, although the acting skills are still stiff, overall, she is qualified. This is a promising talent with a very promising future. Yan Shaopeng is not very natural, but not too excessive. This is not easy for a new actor to achieve. Xu Huan's Mrs. Feng Si is the best actor in the whole play.

Wang Yuanlong's acting is still stable and responsible.

Biographical Film "Rhapsody in Blue"

"Rhapsody in Blue" is a biographical film that depicts the life of the modern American musician George Gershwin, and can be called a sister work to the recently released "Hans Christian Andersen". We will not discuss the achievements of these two musicians. Speaking of the script alone, then this "Rhapsody in Blue" is more dramatic. Although the love triangle greatly helped the rich drama of this script, George Gershwin's life experience is not exceptionally humane and vivid in the processing of the screenwriter.

In terms of performance, the director's achievements cannot be considered successful, and many scenes are handled very loosely.

Lobert Arda, who played George Gershwin, is quite good. It is said that this is a new actor on the screen for the first time, which is even more commendable. Joan Leslie's performance is beautiful, lively and lovely. Alec Steele Smith's performance is excellent.

The music in this film is worth listening to.

"Blood Sea Loyal Souls" and "Paratrooper Blood Battle on the Rhine"

"Blood Sea Loyal Souls" was produced by a small American film company. The technology is very simple, the script material is old, and the actors have no better achievements. The other film "Paratrooper Blood Battle on the Rhine" is a war documentary released by British "Gaumont". The play is very simple, but lacks brilliance. The reason why this film can sell out is because it understands the light of "fake phoenixes".

### Engineers with Meager Income Wish to Take on Art and Graphic Design

Editor: I am a so-called "Bachelor of Engineering" degree holder and an unnamed engineer with more than nine years of work experience. Because I have relatively exquisite architectural design and drawing perspective diagrams and other "skills" and rich construction experience, I still have a relatively stable "civil servant" position today. It is said that I am a lucky member, but I have to use the tens of thousands of yuan of salary I earn from my hard work every month to support a family of seven. If there are no unexpected expenses, I can barely get by with a month of vegetable and rice meals. But now I am already two months behind on my salary, because my wife and children have been sick for more than two months, not pneumonia, but malnutrition or stomach problems. These three diseases all require long-term recuperation. Under these circumstances, it is not necessary to elaborate on my pain. I once thought about changing careers to do business, but I don't have the capital, and it's not necessarily profitable; I thought about suicide, but I couldn't bear to kill seven lives. Now I think the only thing I can do is to find a position in the industrial and commercial sector or an agency with a higher salary (a trial period can be given first). I can also be responsible for designing drawings for advertisements, furniture, fashion, etc. If there is anyone who needs me, please send a letter to Ren Shiqi, Linliao Warehouse, Hangjiang Yarn Factory, 138 Daxijie, Hangzhou. Sincerely, I wish you well.

Sincerely, Jiang Fengsheng
