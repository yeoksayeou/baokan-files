They first broke into the Yan'an urban area from Jinpenwan, 30 kilometers southeast of Yan'an, yesterday morning. Subsequently, another division attacked from the north of Ganquan and also entered the city one after another. After merging with the first unit to enter the city, they began a mopping-up operation. After a period of street fighting, the Communist army was unable to resist and began to flee into the nearby mountainous areas. Currently, the National Army, with the exception of a portion left in Yan'an, is tracking and pursuing them. It is claimed that the National Army annihilated over 10,000 Communist army soldiers in this battle. The National Army is currently expanding the battle results.

The Central Daily News and Peace Daily News both issued extra editions. A reporter interviewed a certain military observer, asking for his views on this. The observer said: "Yan'an is a stronghold that the Communist army has occupied for twelve years. The Communist army uses this as a basis for international propaganda. Now that their old nest has been lost, their international propaganda effectiveness will also be completely lost, and the Communist army's way out will become that of roaming bandits."

Wang Hongshao judged that the CCP may be isolated into the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shanxi-Suiyuan border regions in the future, and its main force will tend towards Shanxi, but it may also cross the Ping-Sui Railway, passing through Chahar North and Jehol North, and fleeing to the Northeast.

### Plenary Session Reviews Military Affairs Yesterday; Chief of General Staff Chen Attends and Answers Questions; Today's Session Reviews Politics and Economics

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Third Plenary Session held its fourth plenary session at 9:30 AM on the 19th. 262 members attended. Zou Lu chaired the session. First, the secretariat reported on the minutes of the third session, and then began questioning Chen Cheng's military report. Those who raised questions included Cheng Zhonghang, Shu Haosen, Gu Zhengding, Ma Chaojun, Li Wenfan, and Li Zhongxiang. The questions focused on three points: (1) strengthening military service, (2) treatment of soldiers, and (3) morale. The above questions will be summarized and handled together within the Military Proposal Review Committee. The session recessed at 11:00 AM. After 25 minutes, Wang Jun continued with oral questioning, and Yao Dahai submitted written questions. Chen Cheng answered the questions raised by the members of the Central Committee one by one. Chief of General Staff Chen stated that the morale of the front lines was very good and there was no fundamental problem. From the previous battles in southern and central Shandong, it was learned that the Communist army had no political training or party will. The Communist Party often drove captured National Army soldiers and militia to act as vanguards. Most of the Communist soldiers did not understand the mission and goals of their operations. As for the treatment of National Army soldiers, it was the government's duty to improve it, but the National Army's mission was not only to eliminate the Communist army but also to provide relief to the people in the pacification zone, so this issue needed to be considered. The session adjourned at 12:10 PM.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Chief of General Staff Chen Cheng reported to the plenary session at 10:30 AM on the 19th, while answering questions on military issues, that he had received an air force inspection report from the front lines at 8:00 AM that morning, stating that the vanguard of the National Army had advanced to a location eight li from Yan'an. At that time, the participants also knew that Yan'an, the Communist Party's military and political center, would be captured soon, but they did not expect the National Army to advance so quickly. According to Chief of General Staff Chen's response to questions at the plenary session, after the Communist army launched its spring offensive, the National Army began its advance towards Yan'an on the 14th. The battles have been very fierce in recent days. It is reported that the Communist army on that line was under the command of He Long, gathering no less than 100,000 troops, attempting to capture Xi'an in one fell swoop, but after the National Army launched a counterattack on three routes, east, south, and west, they were unable to resist and retreated. It is reported that after the Communist army launched its spring offensive, it openly denied the National Government and engaged in military operations, causing the government to be forced to begin its advance towards Yan'an. The fourth plenary session today had a lively discussion of military issues. It is expected that the plenary session will have an important and solemn expression on this issue.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at the National Goods Building at 4:00 PM on the 19th. Minister Peng Xuepei answered the following questions:

Q: What is the military situation? What is the government's outlook? What is the situation around Yan'an and on other fronts?

A: The National Army entered Yan'an at 10:00 AM on the 19th. The future situation is still more complicated than the CCP's policy. The CCP has always disregarded the suffering of the people and insisted on a policy of force. The government's attitude will depend on whether the CCP wants to rebel against the country and the government to the end. The situation on the other fronts last week was roughly as follows:

(1) In the Northeast, the Communist army attacked Dehui and Nong'an again, crossing the Songhua River southward on March 9. The National Army began its counterattack on the 12th. The fighting was fiercer in the Nong'an area than in the Dehui area. The Communist army suffered more than 20,000 casualties in and around Nong'an. On the 16th, the Communist army began to collapse. The Songhua River south has now been cleared.

(2) There are no important changes in Shandong.

Q: What is the current situation in Taiwan? What are the government's plans to reform the administration of the region?

A: Taiwan has been completely pacified. Minister Bai has clearly stated the administrative reform plan on the day of his arrival in Taiwan, in accordance with the intentions of the central government.

The Exchange Rate Between the US Dollar and Legal Tender Will Not Change; It Is Not Yet Time to Adopt a New Monetary System

A: The rumors of revising the exchange rate are completely unfounded. Unifying the currency system will definitely be realized in the future.

Q: It is widely rumored in the newspapers of Nanjing and Shanghai that the Third Plenary Session has a proposal to adopt a new monetary system based on the gold standard. Is this report true? Does the government plan to adopt the long-rumored new monetary system?

A: The government does not intend to adopt a new monetary system and has repeatedly denied this. As for changing to the gold standard, although some scholars advocate it, today is clearly not the time.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Regarding the rumors of a new monetary system, the reporter interviewed the financial authorities yesterday. According to the reply, this is only one of the proposals in the Third Plenary Session regarding economic issues, but when it was submitted to the Economic Review Committee for review, it was unanimously believed that the matter was too important and it was definitely not the time to implement it. It will only be considered when the budget can be balanced and prices have stabilized.

Production Loans Will Not Stop; The Use of Gold Is Being Considered

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The rumor in Shanghai newspapers that production loans have been suspended has now been proven to be untrue. According to reliable sources, the plenary session attaches great importance to loans. In the future, a system of fixed orders will be adopted, and factory fixed assets can be used as collateral. A new long-term lending financial institution is currently being planned, and the Central Bank has been designated to handle re-mortgages. As for absorbing floating capital, the method of raising deposit interest rates by national banks may be adopted to solve it.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] There have been many rumors in Shanghai recently. It is reported that the government may not change the official price of gold and foreign exchange, but the central government is considering appropriate measures for the use of gold, or allowing gold to be used to apply for foreign exchange for the import of machinery and essential raw materials, or allowing it to purchase factories when the government sells enemy and puppet industries. Another saying is that the government is currently considering issuing gold bonds or gold deposits, and is hiring people from industry and commerce to organize a fund supervisory committee to act as the supervisory body for bonds or deposits. The government will promulgate a method for private individuals to deposit foreign exchange abroad, which will be used to order machinery and import essential raw materials. As for the financial community's proposal to reorganize the financial company, the plenary session is studying it.

Under the yellow sand, scorching sun, cold wind, and ice and snow, they struggled hard day and night and fortunately completed the closure at 4:00 AM on March 15th of this year. This time, it relied entirely on the collective wisdom and efforts and the assistance of friendly countries. Although there were many twists and turns during the process, it was fortunate to be able to succeed. However, although the closure has been completed, it is only a preliminary step. There is still work to be done in the future, one is to seal the gap and strengthen it, and the other is the downstream embankment restoration project and the work of reorganizing the flood area. The sealing project will take about two months and can be completed in early May. The reorganization work will be decided in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Land Administration Department.

### Egerton Actually Sent a Letter to Xue Dubi Protesting the Closure

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The Huayuankou levee closure project was originally scheduled to be completed on the 15th, but Egerton, the head of the United Relief Association's office in China, sent a letter to Xue Dubi on the 14th, protesting that the closure work was accelerated without prior consultation. However, according to Xue Dubi's conversation with reporters today: This protest is actually a one-sided statement, because in the meeting with the Communist Party and the Executive Relief Administration on February 8th, although the Communist Party requested a postponement of the closure, I solemnly stated that it was impossible to stop work and could only notify in time. Mr. Egerton also expressed his agreement at that time. The protest now is obviously caused by the pressure from the Communist Party. Mr. Xue has replied to Mr. Egerton, with some corrections, detailing the course of the meeting. And after receiving a telegram from Director Huo of the Executive Relief Administration on March 8th inquiring about the situation of the closure, he telegraphed back that it could be completed within ten days from March 9th, and asked him to notify the Communist Party, so Mr. Xue has fulfilled his responsibility. In addition, the reply letter was delivered to Mr. Egerton in Shanghai on the 19th by Wu Youxin, an employee of the association.

Editorial

### The Recovery of Yan'an

Yan'an has been recovered yesterday. The arrival of this news truly makes us feel various emotions. With countless words, we don't know where to begin. Originally, Yan'an was a barren area in northern Shaanxi. The fate of this city was not originally related to the life of the entire nation. However, since the Communist Party established Yan'an as its base, this hilly city on the banks of the Yan River suddenly showed the importance of its position in the political situation of China and even the world. China has countless cities equal to Yan'an, but the reason why Yan'an attracts the attention of the world is because it is the base of the Chinese Communist Party. In the past ten years, it has儼然become a political center in the country, and some people even call it "Red Capital." The establishment of this title cannot be established, and people with a little common sense can say it. The capital of a country originally has only one; how can there be a "Red Capital" outside of a capital? "Red Capital" is tantamount to admitting that Yan'an is the capital. This is what people with common sense are unwilling to do. Speaking of the recovery of Yan'an, some people also call it "recapture," which is also a misnomer. Yan'an was originally Chinese territory, and since it has never fallen into enemy hands, how can one talk about recapture? It has never fallen, so it cannot be said to be recapture. It is only because Yan'an has been occupied by the Communist Party for nearly ten years, and the Communist Party has intentionally plotted a rebellion, and all central government orders have not been able to be implemented in Yan'an; this is a situation of usurpation. Yesterday, the entry of the National Army into the city allowed Yan'an to see the sun again and see the light again. This is recovery, not recapture. This is a point that we cannot but point out first.

Now we want to talk about our views on the recovery of Yan'an. What we cannot but point out is that the recovery of Yan'an still depends on military force, which is really an unfortunate thing. However, after China's long-term war of resistance, the people's livelihood is declining, and society is unstable. The government knows that soldiers are fierce, and originally had no intention of using troops. In the year after Japan's surrender, in order to achieve China's peaceful reunification, the government did not hesitate to negotiate with the Chinese Communist Party again and again, hoping that all issues could be resolved peacefully at the round table. Because of the hope of achieving peaceful reunification, the government has been tolerant again and again. All of these, as long as people who pay a little attention to national affairs can say it. However, the Communist Party does not understand the government's good intentions, because they put the interests of the party before the interests of the nation, so the agreement established by the government at the cost of tolerance is regarded by them as a piece of paper; moreover, they have intensified their efforts to gain an inch and are endlessly greedy. For the Communist Party, consultation is originally a child's play, and its purpose is to rule the entire China; therefore, the ink of the agreement is not dry, and new tricks are renewed, and its desire to destroy the vitality of our nation after the war is undisguised. In recent months, the Communist Party has even denied the constitution formulated by the National Congress, denied the National Government and the conditions signed with foreign countries, and deliberately opposed the people and the government. At the same time, it has launched a full-scale offensive in various parts of the country and destroyed unity. The government is forced to use troops, which is really a last resort.

But we still feel that soldiers are fierce, and it is best not to use soldiers. After China has undergone a long-term war of resistance, it is full of scars and is really unbearable to have another war. Therefore, when the good news of the recovery of Yan'an came, we felt deeply that since Yan'an has been recovered, we should not use troops again in the future. Using force to resolve disputes is the most primitive method; the government's unwillingness to use force to resolve the Communist Party issue in China has been described above. It is only because the Communist Party believes that it has military force to rely on and has repeatedly caused chaos, so the government has to deal with it with force; this is not the case for the government. Now that Yan'an has fallen, we should at least have an indication that we will not use troops again in the future. We should give the Communist Party another chance so that it can take into account the interests of the nation, abandon its military force, and seek China's peaceful reunification and revival. However, according to the consistent style of the Chinese Communist Party in the past twenty years, no matter how sincere the Communist Party's expression is, there are other ghosts in it, which is also a well-known thing; then, we should have such a stroke of not using troops again, which is naturally not without problems. We should place our trust on the government's shoulders; the government's decisions are certainly made after repeated consideration.

What we want to raise here is the vigilance of the people of the country; that is, although Yan'an has fallen, the problem of the Chinese Communist Party still exists. The recovery of Yan'an is not the solution to the CCP problem. Yan'an has become a target in the past; after becoming a target, it may not be beneficial to the CCP's actions. Now that Yan'an has been recovered, for the Communist Party, because they no longer have a target for their sight, perhaps it is part of their original strategic plan: they can have "Yan'an" everywhere. Since we have resorted to force against the CCP, we must defeat all their military force so that they can no longer rely on military force. Peaceful attainment is costly; without bloodshed, how would the warlord Japan and Nazi Germany beg for surrender? Therefore, at this time, if the CCP does not want to isolate itself from the people of the country, it should automatically hand over its military force, participate in the government as an ordinary political party, and jointly implement constitutional government. We believe that the government will be able to be tolerant and give it a new life. China is advancing towards the path of constitutional government, and we do not deny the existence of political struggle. However, using military force as a tool for political struggle cannot be forgiven by the people of the country.

### The Re-mention of the Import and Export Joint Sales System

The import and export joint sales system has been suggested twice by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, but it has not been adopted. Recently, it has made a third suggestion to the Third Plenary Session and the Yuan Department.

Using export foreign exchange to offset import foreign exchange, there is no loss in the national foreign exchange funds. Due to the need for imports, it is necessary to promote exports, and the attack of export development is enough to compensate for the urgent need for imports. Such measures, in the case of scarce funds, sluggish exports, and the failure to obtain timely and sufficient remittances for raw materials and other imports, seem to have no reason to ignore.

However, the central government has not yet made a definite statement on this. It has neither clearly approved it nor categorically refuted it. Its intention is nothing more than two points:

1. There are already established methods for foreign exchange and import and export trade, or it is considered unnecessary. The US exchange rate has increased to 12,000 yuan. This has taken concrete measures to encourage exports and restrict imports, and is making every effort to promote export trade. In addition to the special committee, it is also providing multi-faceted assistance in terms of collection, remittance, and loans. As for the oral side, it implements various restrictions such as prohibition, quota, and heavy tax according to the types. The application, review, and handling of foreign exchange are particularly strict. Generally speaking, its policy of encouraging exports and restricting imports is indeed not much different from the opinions of the industrial and commercial circles. The problem is that due to various obstacles, the sales of all export goods are not as smooth as ideal. Due to the extreme difficulty in applying for foreign exchange, many necessary foreign goods, such as production tools and machine raw materials, have been affected by restrictions, so that the ethnic industry in a critical condition has no way to recover, and its development and operation are deepened. The difficulty. This Third Plenary Session also mentioned this point solemnly, which shows that the effectiveness of the current measures is obviously not enough.

2. Although the principle can be adopted, there are many problems in the method, so we must be cautious and cautious. If it is only for the sake of caution, it is very reasonable. This matter is of great importance and is also an innovation. In the opinion of the industrial and commercial circles, it is said that everyone sees benevolence and wisdom, and it is inevitable that there will be some emphasis. The government plans the overall situation and has to take care of everything, familiar with the advantages and disadvantages, in order to ensure that everything is foolproof and there is no regret. However, if the principle is confirmed to be adoptable in the first step, then the methods and procedures of these technical problems may invite relevant parties, import and export industries, and experts to discuss and develop another plan. Even if the result of the discussion finds too many malpractices, or it is indeed difficult to implement in fact, and there is no remedy. At that time, the advantages and disadvantages are obvious, and the gains and losses are seen by all, and it is natural to be able to stop people's mouths and show people the public.

Economic problems are extremely complicated. In this autumn of industrial and commercial depression, their complexity and severity are more than usual. We do not believe that a simple method can be used to solve all problems. However, any method, if it makes sense and has a reason to hold it, should be considered with an open mind and carefully taken away. This proposal for a chain method has already been the third time, at least to see the importance of this to the industrial and commercial circles. It is okay for the government to adopt it completely, or to refute it. At least, it seems that they should be given a clear answer.

### The Soviet Union Demands Huge Reparations from Germany Marshall Strictly Refuses Urges the Soviet Union to Provide German Industrial Secrets

[United Press Moscow, 18th] US Secretary of State Marshall refused the Soviet Union's proposal for Germany to pay 10 billion US dollars in reparations at the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 18th, and said: "We can never follow Molotov from Potsdam back to Yalta." This statement refers to the fact that the late President Roosevelt, at the Yalta Conference, used 20 billion US dollars as the standard for discussion on the total amount of German reparations, and the Soviet Union could get 10 billion yuan. Although he agreed to consider it, the three powers did not decide on the total amount of German reparations at the Potsdam Conference in 1945. Molotov again pointed out that "the British and American countries have obtained patents, inventions, ships, gold, and German assets abroad in Germany, which are worth 10 billion US dollars." Regarding this point, Marshall denounced it as completely absurd. He also said that the United States has announced to the world the scientific and technical information obtained in Germany, so the Soviet Union should also announce this information. The meeting ended without results.

[This newspaper] London, broadcast on the 19th: When the four foreign ministers resumed the preliminary foundation discussion on the German peace treaty today, the US requested the Soviet Union to provide scientific and industrial secrets obtained from the captives. At 11 am, the four foreign secretaries held a meeting at the Aviation Club, chaired by the British foreign secretary, to study the technical issues of the Allied representatives participating in the German Reparations Committee, and to discuss the political terms of the peace treaty.

[United Press Moscow, 19th] Observers here claimed today that the atmosphere at the first few meetings of the four foreign ministers was still stable and calm, but in recent days, US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin had continuous conflicts with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, which shows that the calm atmosphere has faded. According to the opinions of diplomatic observers, the Soviet Union is in a difficult situation regarding the issue of general national reparations. If Germany remains divided, the amount of reparations obtained by the Soviet Union in western Germany will be very small, or even nothing. If a broad general solution is followed to unify Germany, then the Soviet Union's desire to obtain a large number of German products to fill the demand for reparations will inevitably be abandoned, and it will have to jointly subsidize Germany's expenses with Western countries.

### Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov Announces Another Secret Agreement in Yalta Regarding Post-War Reparations in Germany

[Reuters London, 18th] Molotov announced the content of another secret agreement in Yalta yesterday at the Foreign Ministers' Conference in Moscow, which is related to German reparations. One of the provisions stipulates that German industrial products can be used as reparations at any time. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office confirmed tonight that this secret agreement does exist, and the United States has not yet expressed its confirmation. If confirmed, it will have a significant impact on the discussions in Moscow, because the Soviet Union's pursuit of industrial production as reparations has been firmly opposed by Britain and the United States, which is the main obstacle to discussing the unification of the German economy.

Contents of the Secret Agreement

According to Tass, the content of the secret agreement announced by Molotov is as follows: The leaders of the British, American, and Soviet governments reached an agreement on the issue of German in-kind reparations at the Crimean Conference as follows: (1) Germany should compensate for the losses caused by Germany to the Allied countries during the war with in-kind, and the compensatory goods should be paid first to the country that bears the main responsibility for the war, the country that suffered the most losses, and the country that conspired to win. (2) The compensation materials extracted from Germany shall be in the following three forms: (a) Within two years after Germany's surrender or cessation of organized resistance, extract the main compensation materials from Germany's domestic or foreign German assets (such as equipment, machinery, ships, vehicles, foreign investments, equity in German industrial, transportation, shipping, and other enterprises, etc.); (b) Within a period to be determined after the end of the war, the products of German industry can be used as compensation every year; (c) The use of German labor. (3) After the detailed plan for extracting compensatory materials is established in accordance with the foregoing principles, the Allied Reparations Committee shall be established in Moscow by representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom. (4) The US and Soviet delegations agreed on the determination of the total amount of compensation and the distribution to the countries invaded by Germany as follows: In the initial stage, the Moscow Reparations Committee should use the following suggestion of the Soviet government as the basis for discussion, that is, the total amount of compensation should be set at 20 billion yuan according to the provisions of Articles A and B of the previous article, of which 50% should be returned to the Soviet Union. The British delegation believes that the amount of compensation should not be mentioned before the Moscow Reparations Conference is discussed. The suggestions of the aforementioned US and Soviet delegations should be submitted to the Moscow Reparations Committee for review as proposals. The signatories to the agreement are Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.

Outstanding Issues

Since Molotov has published the secret agreement of Yalta, the question to be decided in the future is whether the secret agreement that allows German industrial products to be used as compensation will be regarded as a supplementary part of the Potsdam Agreement, or will it be abolished due to the emergence of the Potsdam Agreement. The Potsdam Agreement did not mention the use of German industrial products as compensation. Molotov believes that the two agreements should be used at the same time, because the first sentence of the chapter on compensation in the Potsdam Agreement is "According to the resolution of Crimea." Although the Potsdam Agreement only stipulates the removal of industrial equipment as compensation, it does not prohibit the use of industrial products as compensation. It only says that the payment of compensation should allow Germany to retain appropriate resources so that it can survive without external assistance. And the payment of German imports should be the primary responsibility of the German economy. According to authoritative sources, the United Kingdom opposes the use of industrial products as compensation because the extraction of industrial products will damage the payment of major imports, and the result is that the British people will bear the cost of the British occupation zone. According to the first secret agreement of Yalta, it was the secret agreement on the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Japan, which was previously announced on February 11, 1946. Observers in London were all surprised by the announcement of the second secret agreement this time. It is still remembered that on March 4, 1946, British Foreign Secretary McNeil answered the members of the House of Commons, expressing that in addition to the secret agreement announced on February 11, he did not know that there were other secrets, and said that if there were any, they would often be announced.

### The House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes US Foreign Relief Funds Our Country May Also Receive Assistance

[Central News Agency Washington, 18th] The US House Foreign Affairs Committee temporarily passed a bill today stipulating that when the United Nations ends its work, it can allocate 350 million yuan to aid European countries, and China may be included. The case is expected to be formally passed by the Foreign Affairs Committee tomorrow, and it does not specifically indicate which countries can receive assistance, but the committee's report to the House of Representatives will specify the countries designated by Acting Secretary of State Jackson, namely Greece, Austria, Hungary, Poland, and Italy. China may also be listed. The case has strict regulations on the needs of countries that may receive assistance.

Aid to Greece and Turkey to be Submitted for Discussion

[United Press Washington, 18th] Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, today requested an immediate discussion of the bill to aid Greece and Turkey. It is reported that it may start tomorrow, and those who will attend the statement are Assistant Secretary of State Axon, Secretary of the Army Patterson, and Secretary of the Navy Forrestal. In addition to restricting military assistance to advisory nature, the legislative draft authorizes the government to supervise the use of aid, and stipulates that representatives of the US newspapers and radio industries can freely report without inspection. The case grants the President five broad powers: (1) to provide financial assistance in the form of loans, credit sales, and subsidies; (2) to send civil officials to assist Greece and Turkey; (3) to designate a limited number of soldiers to work in "advisory capacity"; (4) to supply materials, services, and information; (5) to train personnel from Greece and Turkey? However, this assistance shall not be transferred to another government. If the case is passed, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will pay 100 million US dollars first to facilitate the process. With the active support of Republican leaders, the government plans to complete the legislative procedures before the end of this month when the UK stops providing assistance.

Senators Vandenberg and Connally had a Conflict

[United Press Washington, 18th] Republican Senator Vandenberg argued that the Senate should temporarily discuss Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey before the State Department answers many questions that are still being drafted. Vandenberg therefore clashed with Democratic Senator Connally. Vandenberg denied that he intended to obstruct the progress of the bill, and said: He believes that the Senate can begin the withdrawal of British troops in Greece this week.

[United Press London, 18th] The British Foreign Office revealed late on the 18th that the UK will not absolutely withdraw all personnel in Greece after March 31. The UK will continue to assist the Greek government with military, economic, legal, and police missions.

### France's Economic Plan for Germany Opposes Raising Germany's Industrial Level Agrees to Economic Unification but with Conditions

[Reuters Moscow, 18th] French Foreign Minister Bidault expressed his views on the future economy of Germany at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today. His economic proposals may cause fundamental reforms to the European economy. The opinions stated by Bidault are mainly composed of copper, iron, and coal. He advocates that the iron in the Loraine province of Germany should no longer be supplied to the Ruhr steelmaking. The coal in the Ruhr should be supplied to France to enable France to manufacture steel, and Germany should focus on light industry. He advocates unlimited increase in coal production in the Ruhr region, but Germany's domestic coal consumption should be restricted, and the remaining quantity should be exported in a specified quantity every month. Germany's steel production should be strictly restricted, and the limitation of its production capacity must be specially studied. France believes that Germany's steel production must not exceed the limit of 5.8 million tons per year set by the Allied Management Committee a year ago. Regarding the issue of economic unification, Bidault said that France opposes the establishment of a central administrative body in Germany before Germany's borders are determined, but the French government believes that economic unification can be implemented in accordance with the memorandum it submitted in January this year. The other three foreign ministers had no response to Bidault's proposal for a while, but his proposal to limit Germany's steel production was clearly in conflict with Molotov's proposal yesterday. Molotov announced yesterday that he was willing to increase Germany's steel production to between 12 million and 14 million tons per year, and the United Kingdom and the United States have agreed to Molotov's proposal.

### Truman Returns to Washington

[This newspaper] San Francisco, broadcast on the 19th: In view of the rapid development of domestic and foreign situations, Truman has ended his vacation and is preparing to fly back to Washington today. Since President Truman left Washington, changes have taken place in the diplomatic policies of the two parties. If it is allowed to deteriorate, it will affect Truman's consistent diplomatic policy of preventing the spread of the red tide in Greece and Turkey. The second is to persuade a part of the senators, who believe that Truman's policy towards Greece and Turkey is violating the limits of the United Nations.

### The French Communist Party's Distrust of the Government Rumors that the Ramadier Cabinet will Resign After Secret Discussions, the Prime Minister Said that the Government is Not in Crisis

[United Press Paris, 19th] The French Parliament debated all night yesterday, and the Communist Party abstained from the vote of confidence in the government's Vietnam policy. The government's Vietnam policy bill was finally passed by a majority, but according to this morning's news, French Prime Minister Ramadier may submit his resignation to President Auriol before noon today. The Communist Party's abstention was due to an order from Deputy Prime Minister Thorez, the leader of the party, which was purely a manifestation of distrust of the government. Under such circumstances, according to French political traditions, it is tantamount to clearly stating that the Prime Minister must submit his resignation. Most observers believe that if the Ramadier government does not resign, Auriol will invite Ramadier to form a new cabinet that does not accommodate the Communist Party. The Communist Party's refusal to endorse the government's Vietnam policy arose from the government's rejection of the Communist Party's proposal to negotiate with Ho Chi Minh.

General de Gaulle, who has withdrawn from French practical politics, has been silent. Today, he suddenly announced that he will deliver an important speech when he attends the two-week anniversary of Strasbourg's liberation from the Germans on April 7.

[French News Agency Paris, 19th] Prime Minister Ramadier declared after a confidential cabinet meeting today: "The government has no right." The meeting lasted for hours, exchanging views on the political situation caused by the debate on the Vietnam situation at the General Assembly last night.

### Spain Plans to Formulate a Plan to Change the Monarchical System

[Reuters Madrid, 18th] Well-informed sources close to the Franco government said: A small group of four officials has formulated a plan to declare Spain a monarchy ruled by an executive group, which will be submitted to the Spanish Cabinet Cesar. The executive group is headed by Franco. This step is the first step in the restoration. After the case is passed by the cabinet, it will be submitted to the Military Committee to draft a formal constitution, and then submitted to the Congress for approval. After the public votes, it is expected that all the procedures will take several days to complete.

### "Work to Survive": British Prime Minister Encourages the Nation

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Prime Minister Attlee delivered a broadcast address to the nation tonight, titled "Work to Survive," urging the people to exert their utmost effort to overcome the current planting difficulties. It is said that the British people have never been dismayed by difficulties. The greater the crisis, the stronger their desire to serve the country. We should strive for victory in peace, just as we strive for victory in war.

### U.S. Policy Inconsistency towards Europe and Asia: Congressmen to Raise Questions

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Some Republican congressmen have begun to question why the United States is allocating funds to assist the Near East to deter communism while withholding funds from China and Korea. According to several senior members of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees, who did not want to be named, they told this agency that "when Congress discusses President Truman's proposal to provide $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey, this point will be a major issue. The United States intends to withdraw from China and has not prevented communism in China and Korea, so why does it feel it is absolutely necessary to aid Greece and Turkey? This is something the authorities should answer satisfactorily." Republican Congressman Judd and other congressmen believe that the situation in China is no different from that in Greece and Turkey, and it is incomprehensible that the United States refuses to aid President Chiang Kai-shek. According to Congressman Vorys, he has discussed this matter with various congressmen, and most opinions believe that "if the United States is to take action, all of the United States' actions abroad must conform to the policies we adopt in the future." While Marshall is attending the meeting in Moscow and Truman is on vacation, the State Department clearly has no explanation for this contradiction. When acting Secretary of State Wilkinson was asked about this, he replied that the State Department was also aware of this contradiction, but could not think of an answer at the moment. Some people in the State Department, however, argue that there is no contradiction, as the guerrillas in Greece clearly have foreign aid, while there is no clear evidence of this in China. Generally, congressmen believe that if the United States' policy of deterring communism is to be implemented rationally, China should receive American aid.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Republican congressmen insisted today that the government's foreign policy, as well as its plans for China, Korea, Iran, Palestine, Hungary, and France, must be extensively reviewed before allowing the use of U.S. dollars to build a barrier against communism in Greece and Turkey.

### British Naval Construction Plan: Will Focus on Coping with Atomic Warfare; Cruiser "Aurora" to be Delivered to China

[Reuters, London, 18th] Naval Undersecretary Dugdale presented the naval budget of £196,700,000 to the House of Commons today, and announced that the cruiser "Aurora" would soon be handed over to China. In addition, several cruisers, two small aircraft carriers, several destroyers, and several small ships have been or will soon be handed over to various self-governing dominions, Britain's allies, and India, some as gifts, some as sales, and some as loans. He also said that the production of naval aircraft is increasing, and only a few destroyers will be launched this year. There are no plans for other large-scale shipbuilding projects. Funds will be used for research, especially the effect of atomic bombs on naval tactics. Britain can no longer hope to have the world's largest navy, but hopes to have the best-equipped navy.

### Yoshida Shigeru Expresses Views, Praising MacArthur's Stance; Hopes U.S. Troops Will Not Withdraw After the Signing of the Peace Treaty

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Prime Minister Yoshida told United Press reporters today that if the United States wants to ensure world peace after the formal peace treaty is signed, U.S. troops must remain in Japan indefinitely. Yoshida predicted that a peace treaty with Japan could be concluded within the year, after which he would prefer the protection of the United States rather than a United Nations organization. Yoshida also said: "We are also at war with the Communist Party. There is an extremely dangerous enemy in the north that must be guarded against. President Truman's recent speech can be regarded as the United States' intention to lead the world in fighting communism. I dare to boldly declare that as long as the world situation is chaotic, the United States must continue to supervise Japan, which is beneficial to both the United States and Japan. Otherwise, all efforts to democratize Japan will be completely abandoned."

[United Press, Tokyo, 19th] Prime Minister Yoshida issued a statement today, reading U.S. General MacArthur's proposal to conclude a peace treaty with Japan and restore Japan's foreign trade as soon as possible. It is said that "MacArthur's remarks to reporters stationed in Tokyo on the 17th of this month are of great importance to the future of Japan. The world knows that MacArthur has faithfully implemented the occupation policy. These remarks show that he fully understands the current situation in Japan and fully understands the Japanese people. I dare to express my deep admiration for MacArthur's sympathy for Japan. The entire Japanese people feel the same way."

Acheson's Remarks

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Regarding the statement issued by General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, advocating for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the withdrawal of the occupation forces, and the transfer of Japan to the control of the United Nations, the State Department expressed a surprising reaction. Acting Secretary of State Acheson declared at a press conference that the State Department had not heard of MacArthur's statement beforehand, that it was purely his personal statement, and that for various practical reasons, the United States should deal with the European peace treaty before deciding on a peace treaty with Japan.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] A State Department spokesperson told this agency that the State Department fully agrees with MacArthur's views on various Japanese issues.

### U.S.-Soviet Occupation Zone Border: Korean Police Sergeant Kills Soviet Soldier

[United Press, Seoul, 19th] U.S. military authorities announced today that two Soviet soldiers were shot and killed by Korean police yesterday at the border between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones in Samgyetang. The incident involved a village where Soviet troops planned to take stored rice. One Soviet soldier slapped a Korean policeman in the face, and another ten Soviet soldiers prepared to raise a machine gun to shoot at the policeman. The policeman preemptively opened fire, killing the two Soviet soldiers. The bodies of the Soviet soldiers have been taken to the Soviet occupation zone by about fifty Soviet troops. It is also reported that the Soviet soldiers involved (and the Korean police argued for twenty minutes over which district Samgyetang belonged to. The Soviet soldiers insisted that the village was in the Soviet occupation zone, while the police said that the villagers all paid taxes to the South Korean government. After one Soviet soldier slapped the policeman, another Soviet soldier picked up a machine gun and fired, accidentally hitting his comrade in the leg. The Korean police also fired a volley of shots, killing the Soviet soldier.

### Severe Winter Just Ended, Accumulated Snow Just Melting: Major Floods in Britain; Severity of Disaster Unseen in Three Hundred Years

[Reuters, London, 19th] Thirty of England's forty counties have been flooded, and the water level is still rising. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in three hundred years.

### Over Twenty Defendants Lacked Sufficient Evidence: Investigation of the Connaught Building Bloodshed Case Concluded; All Given Non-Prosecution Disposition; Chen Shijun Also Had No Premeditated Attempt to Assault People; Liang Renda's Part Awaits the Arrest of the Culprit for Further Handling

[Our Report] The "Connaught Building Bloodshed Case," which caused a stir and was of concern to the social community, has now been concluded by the District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutor, based on the spirit of judicial independence, fairly measured with an attitude of neither letting off the guilty nor wrongly accusing the innocent. It was believed that the defendants Cao Zhenkun, Shen Xiafeng, Wang Yuxiang, Wang Fugen, Cai Yutian, Chen Xun Guan, She Xue San, Liu Zongde, Xu Weicheng, Li Ruichun, Li Baxiong, Li Ruikang, Yang Jun, Shen Shikui, Meng Zhisheng, Zeng Yongquan, Zhu Yong, Ao Peikun, Dong Qiding, Jiang Laishun, Yang Xiaochu, Chen Shijun, etc. (including Liang Renda, who is deceased and therefore not listed), although the police bureau identified them as having committed crimes of disrupting order or abetting injury, etc., there was no corroborating evidence after investigation. It was difficult to establish them, so a non-prosecution disposition was granted. Prosecutor Liu Yongzhi's non-prosecution disposition document explained the case in two parts:

(1) Regarding the part where Cao Zhenkun and other twenty-one defendants were sued for disrupting order. Cao Zhenkun, Shen Xiafeng, and other twenty-one defendants are all employees and machinists of Shanghai's New New, Sincere, Wing On, China National Products, China Textile, or other yarn factories, and are also mostly members of the Department Store Trade Union. On the morning of February 9, 1947, they participated in the "Speech Meeting" convened by the full board of directors and supervisors of the Three Districts Department Store Trade Union, which was responsible for the "Preparatory Committee for Loving National Goods and Resisting American Goods." When the meeting had not yet formally begun, a dispute occurred at the meeting site on the third floor of the China Industry Building on Nanjing East Road. The Municipal Police Bureau considered that the defendants Cao Zhenkun and other twenty-one defendants were not without brawling and injuring each other, and assisting the situation on the scene. They were suspected of violating the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 150 of the Criminal Law on disrupting order and were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

This office believes that disrupting order refers to hindering or disturbing the state of tranquility maintained by the country, and the constitution of the crime in Article 150 of the Criminal Law should have two essential elements: publicly gathering a crowd and implementing violence and coercion, lacking one

cannot be established. The investigation of the preparation of the "Love National Goods and Resist American Goods Association" was jointly responsible for by the directors and supervisors of the Three Districts Department Store Trade Union, Chen Shijun, Ding Shengya, Han Chengwu, Liu Caizhang, Mo Buyun, Lu Peiyu, Zhu Weiren, Ling Yuandi, Lu Hengfu, and other nine people. During the preparation period, they adopted joint responsibility, shared the work, and did not elect anyone to manage the association affairs. On February 9, department store employees were convened to meet on the third floor of the China Industry Building, and famous figures Luo Longji, Ma Xulun, Ma Yinchu, Guo Moruo, Deng Chumin, and other famous figures were invited

to attend the speech (whether the association was approved or filed with the local competent party and government authorities is an administrative issue). Judging from the meaning of its organization, it was responding to the Love National Goods Movement launched by the Shanghai Municipal Council, intending to call on workers and manufacturers in various industries to participate and jointly plan the progress. On that day, only Guo Moruo and Deng Chumin were invited to attend, and the rest were absent due to various reasons. Before the start of the speech, no one could

dare to speculate what the content advocated. It is obvious that they had no intention of disrupting order and no act of violence and coercion. Subsequently, before the speech meeting had even begun, more than a hundred people suddenly arrived from outside, and the meeting place began to brawl. Sixteen of the defendants, including Wang Yuxiang, were all injured on the spot. The defendants firmly denied the implementation of violence and coercion, as well as the mutual fighting. Since these defendants were all injured people, and there was no corroborating evidence to confirm the defendants' participation in mutual fighting or assaulting people, the defendants themselves could not even point out who had harmed them. They only said that there were more than a hundred people dressed as workers, who came

bursting in through the door from outside and started hitting people when they saw them. Later, the Huangpu and Laoza Police Sub-bureaus, after being reported, arrived forty minutes late to rescue them. They only saw the defendants injured or fleeing in the chaos and arrested them. The assailants were nowhere to be found. This office summoned police personnel. According to their statements, it was impossible to prove who exactly committed the assault in this case. The reason why the defendants were arrested was because they were scattered and injured, which was just an emergency measure during the rescue.

After referring to the investigation reports, interview records, interrogation records, etc. of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau, the defendants were the victims who were beaten and injured, and there was no evidence of aiding, conspiracy, or publicly gathering a crowd, implementing violence and coercion, or other acts of assisting the masterminds that could be referred to. After considering the circumstances and deliberations, it is obviously difficult to question them with

any crime. In accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a non-prosecution disposition is given to seek fairness in the law and circumstances.

(2) Regarding Meng Zhisheng, Chen Sihong, and Wang Yuxiang's accusation of Chen Shijun (Chairman of the Three Districts Department Store Trade Union) for the crime of abetting injury, the accusers were innocently beaten, and Chen, as the convener of the meeting, could not shirk his responsibility. The investigation revealed that the situation of the melee on the spot and Chen Shijun's leaving after being coerced out of the meeting place before even entering the meeting place were facts. Even if the meeting notice was issued by the association, there was no

premeditated attempt to assault people, and there was no factual basis to prove it. The accusers being injured in the melee was not Chen Shijun's criminal responsibility. The accusers' accusations were unreasonable, so a non-prosecution disposition was granted in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

As for Liang Renda (employee of Wing On Company), who attended the meeting on that day, was beaten and injured, and died from serious injuries, the culprits should be arrested and punished separately according to law.

### Farewell Candlelight Gathering for Four Nurse Representatives

### Chen Sancai's Martyrdom Case for Plotting to Assassinate Traitor Wang Jingwei: White Russian Informant Sentenced to Fifteen Years

[Our Report] Chen Sancai, former general manager of the North Pole Company, was engaged in underground work in Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War. Due to the plan to assassinate traitor Wang Zhaoming, the opportunity was not secretive, and he was betrayed by the White Russian Tao Jue. After being arrested, he died in Nanjing. After the victory, the White Russian was arrested by the authorities, and the Tsinghua Alumni Association and others repeatedly requested that he be severely punished. It is now learned that Tao Ci has been sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment by the High Court on the 15th of this month. According to Chen Sancai, who was affiliated with the Military Statistics Bureau, he secretly plotted to assassinate Wang Jingwei with the White Russian Tao Ci and others. Because he refused Tao Ci's request for a huge amount of money, he was sold out and reported to the puppet government. Chen's residence was in Meiliyuan on Daxilu Road, which was then called a "bad area." In mid-July of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Tao Ci led puppet government personnel to arrest Chen and escort him to Nanjing. Wang initially did not intend to harm him, but lured him with false positions such as Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications, but Chen was unmoved. Later, Wang was assassinated again, and he resented Chen, so he was tied to Yuhuatai and executed by shooting on October 2 of that year. When Chen was arrested, his cousin Tang Huiyu was also arrested and released soon after. He heard in prison that the whole incident was secretly harmed by the White Russian Tao Jue, so after he was released from prison, he reported to the Engineering Bureau to detain Tao Ci once in the Jing'an Temple Police Station, but he was released due to the pressure from the 76th. However, he secretly took a photo of Tao Ci as evidence. After the victory, he reported the situation to General Dai Li. Unexpectedly, Tao Ci turned to work for the Zhongyi Salvation Army in the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, so he was not prosecuted at first. Later, at the strong request of the relatives and friends of the victim, Tao Ci and his brother were arrested in January last year. Recently, the Tsinghua Alumni Association and the United Youth Association requested the authorities to quickly convict him. On the morning of the 15th of this month, the High Court sentenced him to 15 years of imprisonment for the crime of colluding with the enemy country, and his brother was declared innocent.

### Wu Yimin Denies Serving as Enemy Secret Agent in Retrial

[Our Report] Wu Yimin, who had served as an enemy military police secret agent, was accused of being a traitor. The High Court had previously sentenced him to life imprisonment. Wu was dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, which remanded the case for retrial. The High Court reopened the investigation court yesterday for questioning. During the occupation of Shanghai, Wu worked in the telegraph bureau managed by the enemy army. Later, due to his acquaintance with Sasuke Saeki of the Shanghai Kempeitai, he served as a secret agent for the team. In May of the 34th year of the Republic of China, he learned that Wang Jianying, a neighbor of his friend Yang Qigao, was serving in the Southeast Training Class of the Zhongyi Salvation Army in Quzhou. He came to Shanghai, and soon he would accompany Bian Qigao to Quzhou. Wu secretly reported it to the enemy military police team, and Yang Zhu and others were arrested and detained for more than a month before being freed. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Yang Wang reported to the police bureau, and Wu was arrested and brought to justice. Wu argued in court yesterday that he admitted that he had worked as a telegraph bureau employee, but denied that he had served as an enemy military police secret agent. Regarding the arrest of Yang Wang, he also claimed that he did not know about it. The court interrogated him for a long time, and because further investigation was needed, he was ordered to reschedule the trial.

### Puppet Agent Lü Fugang's Crimes Confirmed, Two Victims Jointly Report His Treachery to the Bureau

[Report from our newspaper] After puppet agent Lü Fugang was arrested by the Lao Zha Police Bureau, he was taken to Madunhe Hat Shop on Wangping Street and Jigeng Lane the day before yesterday for identification, as detailed in yesterday's report. Yesterday, Zhu Guangyuan (30 years old, from Xuzhou, residing at 105 Yükang Road, currently a captain trainee in the palace corps of the 29th Army of the Central Training Corps) and Xu Zhaogui (from Xinghua, 37 years old, residing at 5 Lane 5, Yongqingli, Xiaosadu Road, currently a worker at the Asia Oil Drum Factory in Pudong) went to the branch bureau together to report.

They claimed that in July of the 27th year of the Republic of China [1938], they were ordered by the Military Intelligence Bureau to come to Shanghai from Hankou to undertake underground work. In September of the 30th year of the Republic of China [1941], they were ordered by their superiors to recruit patriotic elements as much as possible. At that time, a friend of Xu introduced Lü Fugang to them, and Xu then recommended him to Zhu for enrollment as a team member. Unexpectedly, Xia Zhongming, the chief of the puppet investigation and statistics department, learned of this and sent his henchmen to lure Lü with benefits. Lü eventually betrayed them and even colluded with the Japanese military police to raid the residence of an old woman in Meifangli, Roberts Road, seizing a list of names of Zhu and Xu. On October 18 of the same year, Lü also led the Hongkou Military Police Corps and personnel from the Fourth Road Patrol to Xu's residence at 5 Lane 5, Yongqingli, Xiaosadu Road. Xu happened to be out, so they arrested his wife, Xiao Lanhua. Xiao Lanhua, unable to endure the torture, was forced to lead them to the residence of their friend Zhao Laimin on Wuding Road, where they arrested Zhu and Xu. They were taken back to the military police headquarters and subjected to all kinds of torture. Later, they were transferred to the No. 76 headquarters, where they were again beaten and forced to confess. In February of the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942], they were transferred to the puppet "Rehabilitation Institute" in Nanjing, where they were detained until they were released in March of the 33rd year of the Republic of China [1944]. Now, having read in the newspaper that Lü Fugang has been arrested, they have come to the bureau to report and request severe punishment according to the law. Branch Chief Shi immediately brought Lü to confront them, and Lü admitted that the facts were true and did not deny anything.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Advisor

Inheritance Dispute

Zhang Rulin: A's son, B, was adopted into the clan of C when he was young (registered with the county government). C later died of illness, and B was still taken back by A to raise. At the same time, C's mother wrote a will stating that all of C's property belonged to B. In the 33rd year of the Republic of China [1944], B died of illness in Sichuan, and C's sister took the opportunity to overturn the previous case, wanting to divide C's property equally with B (after B's death, A adopted his nephew as the heir). At that time, A was intimidated by the power of B's sister (her husband held a position in the puppet government and had considerable influence), and had to sign his name to acknowledge it, but he was not satisfied. He asks: (1) Can C's mother's will, witnessed and written by clan relatives and friends, take effect? (2) Is a document forcibly signed under duress during the enemy-puppet period valid? (3) Does B's nephew have inheritance rights after B's death? (4) Does C's sister's husband have inheritance rights to her property? (5) Can A file a case with the court to request the maintenance of the original case?

[Answer from Lawyer Zhu Yakui] (1) Valid, (2) There must be evidence of reliance on enemy-puppet power, (3) No, (4) Illegal, (5) It depends on the interpretation of the situation.

Over fifty Chinese and foreign alumni of Harvard University in Shanghai attended the cocktail party last night, a lively gathering. Hu delivered a short speech in English, discussing his relationship with Harvard and the various activities and achievements he witnessed at Harvard during his time in the United States. Hu received his first honorary degree from Harvard and taught Chinese literary history there. During the war, Harvard offered special training classes for military personnel. In the language course, Chinese language was taught by phonetician Zhao Yuanren, who used scientific methods to create an "atmosphere" where students were encouraged to use Chinese as much as possible during lectures, encouraging students to speak and write. It was very successful. In just nine months, the students were able to speak and write, and even perform plays or joke with each other in Chinese. Other activities at Harvard's various colleges were also very active, with much participation in research on radar, atomic bombs, and other projects. Hu wore a gown yesterday and was amiable and approachable. When reporters asked if he had completed his mission to the South, Hu replied in a pleasant tone that in addition to presiding over the board of directors of the Peking Union Medical College and attending the board of directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, he had also participated in "extra" work such as the Academic Evaluation Council. He may return to the South again when the National Political Council opens in Peiping in May. The famous scientist Ren Hongjun was also present yesterday. Ren is the Secretary-General of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. He visited the Foundation's directors in the United States half a year ago and recently returned to China.

### Overview of Education in Suzhou

[Our Suzhou, 19th dispatch] Wang Zhirui, Director of the Wu County Education Bureau, met with our reporter and provided the following comprehensive overview of the current state of education in Suzhou: Education in the county has improved significantly compared to the past. According to statistics, there are a total of 31 public and private middle schools in the county, with 186 classes and approximately 8,300 students. There are 290 national schools with 772 classes. There are currently 345 classes in people's education, with a total of more than 38,000 students. In addition, there are 59 private primary schools with 267 classes and approximately 14,500 students. There are approximately 2,000 teachers and staff, with monthly expenses exceeding 289 million yuan, exceeding 30% of the county's expenses. However, such a large figure can only cover salaries and benefits, with not a penny left for operational expenses. Although the locality has 16,000 mu of academic land and dozens of properties, the income is extremely meager, less than 30%. The future direction for developing national education is to tentatively maintain the status quo in urban areas while expanding it to rural areas. Considering the county's population of 1.18 million, only over 60,000 people are receiving education. The future of education awaits our efforts.

[Our Wuhu dispatch] The student uprising at the provincial Anhui College, which was caused by the dismissal of professors last year, is becoming increasingly unmanageable. A group of professors organized an investigation committee and reported to the Auditing Department that the college president, Cheng Yansheng, was corrupt. In November of last year, the Auditing Department ordered the Anhui Provincial Auditing Office to conduct a thorough investigation. The investigation has now concluded that the college president is indeed suspected of embezzling public funds and will report the situation to the Control Yuan for punishment. On the student side, there is also widespread panic and unease. At approximately 6:00 PM on the 28th of last month, more than fifty students gathered outside the president's office at the North Guangji Temple and sent representatives inside to present four demands to the college president, Cheng Yansheng: (1) Dismiss Cai Binmou, the dean of academic affairs, (2) Invite all dismissed professors back to the school, (3) Make the school's finances public, (4) Start classes as soon as possible. The momentum was fierce, and it almost caused an incident. The police arrived at the scene to suppress the situation, and they dispersed.

The situation has escalated, and the authorities need to handle it properly.

### From the World Games to the National Games (Part Two)

— Wang Weijun

Holding the National Games this year has at least two major significances: (1) The World Games, to be held in England next August, is the first after the victory of the United Nations, and has profound significance. It is not only a restoration of pre-war international sports activities but also related to international relations, cooperation, and diplomacy. Our country, having joined the ranks of the four major powers as a result of this victory, has greatly increased its international status. We must not lag behind in anything, and the same goes for sports. We should select athletes from various sports to represent us in the Games, and the more representatives we send, the better. If limited by a lack of talent, the number of representatives sent should not be less than the number sent to the previous World Games (the total number of representatives sent by our country to the previous World Games was 120). At least it should not be fewer than the previous number. As for the quality of the results, whether or not we score points, we need not worry about that. We can use the great opportunity of sending representatives to next year's World Games to observe and learn from others, using it as a way to gain assistance from others. We can only produce representatives to participate in the World Games by holding a National Games of an overall nature, using it to select outstanding athletes as representatives, and then providing them with a period of training and cultivation in various skills.

(2) Our country has been affected by the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, and the National Games have been suspended for many years. Now that we have achieved complete victory for nearly two years, not only has our international status increased day by day, but the whole country has also gained more consolidated benefits from the victory (naturally, except for a small number of traitors who have betrayed their conscience). We are making greater efforts to promote the future of reconstruction, and the sports industry is of great importance to the future of reconstruction and the health of the entire nation. We should quickly seek to restore the National Games to demonstrate and promote the widespread emphasis on sports. Most importantly, in order to show the symbolism of national unity, peace and solidarity after the victory, manifested in sports activities, there is even more need to hold the National Games. As for the location of this National Games, I believe that in terms of the significance of victory and unity, holding it in the capital is most appropriate. If, in order to take care of the actual situation and reduce financial difficulties slightly, we make use of previously used venues, slightly repairing and rebuilding them to save expenses, and pay attention to the most convenient issues of transportation and hospitality, etc., then Shanghai is also suitable for holding this National Games. Even more fruitfully, there will certainly be many spectators in Shanghai, thereby increasing revenue to make up for deficits, which is more certain than in other places.

In summary, although these are just my personal views, I believe that the entire sports community in the country has the same feeling and unanimously hopes that this year's National Games can be held, and that preparations for all aspects can be started as soon as possible. We hope that the government authorities can take into account the above two major significances and find ways to overcome the financial difficulties and realize it as soon as possible. (End)

### The Stock Exchange's So-Called "Temporary Measures" Now Also Levy a Special Margin on Sellers, Collecting 10% of the Transaction Price and Requiring Cash Payment

[Reported by this newspaper] The Stock Exchange has decided that, starting from today's market, it will also collect a special margin of 10% of the transaction price for deferred delivery transactions made by brokers on the seller's side, and all will be collected in cash. According to a spokesperson for the Stock Exchange, the Exchange previously increased the special margin for border trade by 10% because of the recent surge in the stock market. Recently, the market has gradually stabilized, so the special margin for sellers has been increased by 10% to show fairness. However, this is a temporary measure to cope with irregular rises and falls in the stock market and will be canceled once the market trend returns to normal. The Exchange originally offered two types of deferred delivery, Tuesday and Friday. The former, due to sluggish trading, was announced to be suspended from last Saturday, so now only Friday delivery is offered. As for large-scale transactions, they are still proceeding according to the pre-determined plan and have not been interrupted. The telephone is now being set up, and once the work is completed, it can be started. The securities for large-scale transactions have been decided to first open for auction Yongsha, Xinho, Xinguang, and Huafeng Enamel. The trading unit is 50,000 shares for all except Huafeng Enamel, which is 100,000 shares. The brokers engaged in large-scale transactions are currently limited to the top 39 brokers with the most transactions on the Stock Exchange.

### Sparse Transactions in Chinese Stocks

Deferred delivery Yongsha and Xinho rose slightly, Huafeng and Xinguang fell slightly, and Maya fell by half a percent weakly. The cold stock Rongfeng had little demand and little supply and rose alone by more than 10%, Lilian and Zhongfang each rose strongly by half a percent, and the rest saw both rises and falls.

Only odd-lot trading was done in the afternoon, and the news of new currency in the night report caused fluctuations again, and numbers 218 and 99 both entered, pulling up to 2830 yuan. Rongfeng was priced high by numbers 104 and 198 to the limit up, Yongsha fell back to 273 yuan because numbers 185, 97, 226, 223, 172, 4, and 61 all sold. Number 198 immediately entered after exiting, and the market announced that starting from the afternoon of the 20th, a special margin of 10% would be increased for sellers. It immediately stirred, rising to 2820 yuan. Numbers 205, 156, 223, 22, and 198 sold off, falling to 2640 yuan. Under the maintenance of number 152, there was a slight struggle, but as the general trend was gone, numbers 231, 112, and 14 were sold off and fell to 2590 yuan. Maya was forced to stop, and Xinya fell to the limit down. There was a slight consolidation near the close. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yongsha, Xinho, Huafeng, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Zhongfa each fell by half a percent, Maya fell by 10%, and Xinhua and Qinxing fell slightly. Off-market stocks Dasheng was flat, and the rest saw very slight rises and falls.

### Foreign Stocks Decline

Foreign stocks declined slightly yesterday, and Yisha gradually declined from 18250 yuan to end at a low price. Foreign firms successively absorbed, and Paper and Yibei were quite colorful. As a result, compared with the previous close, Paper rose by half a percent, Yibei Steel rose slightly, Yeguang returned slightly by half a percent weakly, and the rest were slightly frustrated.

### Mediocre Uniform-Price Transactions

Public bonds were very mediocre yesterday, and the rises and falls were narrow. Tongbing opened in the morning at 10500 yuan, and the low price was seen at 9800 yuan before short covering activities began, rising to 10800 yuan and closing in a stalemate. The after-hours dark market called high to 11800 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu each fell by 700 yuan, and Bing fell by 800 yuan, with a turnover of about 5 million yuan.

### Small-Loan Committee Holds First Meeting

Maximum Loan Amount of 500,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Small-Loan Committee held its first meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attending were Cai Dianrong, Sun Yongyi, Jiang Jianhou, Wang Xianqing, and several others. The chairman, Cai Dianrong, reported, stating that the Shanghai Winter Relief Association had allocated 100 million yuan as funds and had elected colleagues to organize the Shanghai Small-Loan Committee to handle small-loan affairs. The association's charter was then revised and passed. The loan amount was temporarily decided to be divided into three levels: 200,000, 400,000, and 500,000 yuan. The loan term was stipulated to be four months each time, with monthly interest payments and four installments to be paid off in full. Each person was limited to one loan and could not apply for renewal. The loan guarantee was based on one shop guarantee or two personal guarantees, and the interest rate was stipulated to be 2% per month. The meeting decided to hold a meeting on March 25, at which time the director of the Public Pawnshop would also be invited to attend. Furthermore, it was decided that small loans would be handled regularly in the future, and after the end of this Winter Relief Association, the association would be responsible for handling it, and all matters would be reported in detail to the next Winter Relief Association on the handling process.

### Stabilized Grain and Rice Market Conditions

The total amount of rice from the north and south markets arriving yesterday was 8,000 piculs. The southern market's japonica rice was firm in the early morning and slack in the afternoon, and the result was stable. Indica rice had little fluctuations. The northern market was dull and had little energy, and a drop of 1,000 yuan was seen.

There was still a lot of inland flour arriving. Local flour was stable and fair, and foreign flour was still popular. Bran fell sharply after opening, plunging 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake customer sales turned active, and it was stable in the morning and firm in the afternoon, with a slight upward trend.

There were both rises and falls in soybeans. Northeastern soybeans and Nanyang purchases saw a rise of 1,000 yuan. Local absorption of Duzhou and Han soybeans was not strong and remained mediocre. Nanyang picked high-quality tea beans, and the shape was commercially fixed and dull. Red beans were widely sold and very fine, with a flat pattern.

Red sorghum was in a dull and flat situation, and corn was sluggish and stagnant, with a drop of 1,000 yuan. Broad beans were firm, raw kernels were rising, sesame was trending upward, and cylinder beans from Shantou continued to sell, rising continuously by 1-2,000 yuan.

Qingdao goods continued to arrive in the sleeve market. Crude oil was exhausted again by 3-5,000 yuan, and the remaining goods were flat.

### The Local Money Supply Has Shown Signs of Loosening

Recently, the local money supply has shown signs of easing. Yesterday, the exchange house's exchange notes before number 50 were 4,872, with a total amount of 283.75 billion, 17,100 yuan. Exchange notes after number 50 were 56,688, with a total amount of 306.689 billion, 317,772 yuan, 8 jiao, and 2 fen. The head-to-head position of the four banks and two bureaus was 1.8 billion, while the highest peak of passing the head-to-head position during tight money was 210 billion. According to senior figures in the financial community, the inherent reasons are nothing more than: (1) the accelerated implementation of the emergency economic measures plan has been effective. (2) Recently, the government's absorption of money supply in the market has actually decreased, and the most prominent is the suspension of gold sales, which is about the active aspect. The lack of price increases for public utilities on the negative side is not irrelevant. (3) General speculators and hoarders have a sense of caution. (4) The Strengthening Control of the Import Management Committee has designated banks to purchase little foreign exchange. (5) Commercial firms abide by laws and regulations to reduce fluctuations.

### Cedar Continues to Weaken

The market price of cedar continues to weaken. It is heard that a large Chinese ship continues to arrive, but due to cost considerations, the market price is not easy to return to a large extent. Due to the difficulty of importing and the difficulty of replenishing, foreign pine is still at the 4,000 yuan level.

### Bill Acceptance Fee Should Not Exceed 1/1000th of Face Value

The Joint Office of the Central, Agricultural, Communications, and Farmer's Banks stated that at present, in addition to mortgages, most banks adopt the discount method for handling industrial and commercial loans, and four brand names, namely the drawer, acceptor, discounter, and guarantor, must be issued, and the bank must accept them. The procedures are extremely complicated, and the accepting bank must also charge a handling fee of 1/1000th to 1.5/1000th due to liability reasons, which is equivalent to increasing interest and increasing the burden on industrial and commercial operators. It has telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance to find a way to improve the situation. It is known that regarding this matter, the Ministry of Finance has recently telegraphed the audit office of the Central Bank, stating that the handling fee charged by banks for accepting or guaranteeing bills of exchange shall not exceed 5/1000th of the face value in accordance with Article 9 of the Measures for Acceptance and Discount of Bills of Exchange. However, due to the recent surge in market interest rates, bank operating expenses have also increased significantly compared with the past. In order to take into account the facts and bank operating income and to prevent extra demands, the handling fee should be appropriately increased to 1/1000th. The Ministry of Finance has revised Article 9 of the Measures and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. In the future, the handling fee charged by various firms for acceptance shall not exceed 1/1000th of the face value, and it is hoped that they will pay attention to reporting at any time and transfer it to the department for verification, so as to investigate and handle the matter. The audit office of the Central Bank has sent a circular to various firms, earnestly complying with the above.

### Sugar Falls Back

Yesterday, the sugar market rebounded to be soft, and white sugar saw a fall. The guild's planned disk, such as 22 Zhongsha white, was 216,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan, a drop of nearly 10,000 yuan. The drop in 24 coarse white was greater, at 225,000 yuan to 218,000 yuan. Semi-four-wheeler white was a small 5,000 yuan, and semi-three-wheeler white was a small 10,000 yuan. Peruvian fine sand was initially 203,211,000 yuan, and later 199,000 yuan, a small 4-5,000 yuan. The rise and fall of Taiwan was also slight after the initial exhaustion. In the morning, it was 143-4,000 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was 8,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan. Shantou Qing opened at 131-2,000 yuan, Shunde Qing at 128,500 yuan, Diao Qing at 124,000 yuan, Xinghua White at 191-2,000 yuan, Xing Chi at 131,000 yuan, and a total of 6-700 pieces were traded.

### U.S. Acutely Needs Tung Oil, Price Distance Is Still Far

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office: the recent production of tung oil in the United States is only 10 million pounds per year, and the U.S. paint industry needs tung oil, so it feels extremely short. Before 1941, the amount of tung oil exported from our country to the United States reached 80 million pounds per year, and it was once suspended after the war, but it was restored last year. In terms of the amount of tung oil exported from our country to the United States from January to June alone, it has reached 50 million pounds. The only difficulty at present is that the prices between the two sides have not been close. According to the survey: the price of tung oil in the United States in December last year was about 3.95 U.S. dollars per pound. Recently, the price has gradually moved downstream, to about 3.6 dollars per pound. The price in this city is also 3.4 dollars per pound. If shipping costs, insurance costs, tariffs, etc. are added, selling in the United States will inevitably result in losses. The office is now planning to investigate the actual amount of tung oil that can be exported in this city and at the same time investigate the actual prices of tung oil in the United States and this city in order to find a reasonable solution.

### Weak Cotton Market

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions initially inherited the remaining power from the previous day, and the prices were quite firm and expensive. However, as the wind of currency reform subsided, people's hearts suddenly softened, and new buyers frequently sold off. It was also heard that the prices in Yuehan and other places still had an inversion phenomenon, resulting in a decline in buying power. By the time the market closed, the buying power of various roads did not move, and the actual sales in this street were also mediocre. Therefore, as a result, the price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth fell to 159,000 yuan, a reduction of 3,500 yuan. Blue Phoenix, Blue Yang, and Color Ball and other brands also fell from 2,000 yuan to 4-5,000 yuan. However, bleached cloth and twill poplin were popular due to the order relationship, and the rest of the colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained unchanged.

### A Batch of Yarn and Cloth Shipped South

[Reported by this newspaper] The Hanmin transport sailed to Guangdong yesterday, loaded with 1,850 pieces of cloth, more than 460 pieces of cotton yarn, more than 5,960 bags of raw kernels, 220 bags of beans, and more than 2,000 pieces of groceries, which were transported to Guangzhou.

### Yarn Prices Fall, Transactions are Sparse

Yesterday, the yarn market began to decline. In the initial outcry to sell, the 20 count yarns of various brands fell in a straight line, but buyers still could not muster interest, resulting in sparse transactions. Both 20 count yarns and group yarns fell 100,000 to 150,000, and people's hearts turned weak again.

### Fangjian Sells Yarn

Also reported: yesterday, the Yarn Construction Company routinely sold various cotton yarns, with 42 count Maodie listed at 6.15 million, 20 count Jinshuangma at 3.2 million, and Jinji at 3.04 million. The market was very rare, and manufacturers were sluggish in absorption. Customer groups also cleared slowly. Moreover, Jinbang temporarily stopped transporting north due to the fact that the transfer of funds to set yarn was not profitable. The intention to enter was weak, so 42 count Blue Phoenix shouted 7.2 million yuan, and 32 count shouted 5.5 million yuan, a decrease of 2-300,000 yuan compared with the previous day. Transactions were also only 22 packages.

### Fangjian Sells Yarn as Usual, Totaling 2,682 Pieces

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company routinely sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee, selling a total of 2,682 pieces, including 2,325 pieces from manufacturers and 357 pieces of yarn numbers. A total of 1,246 households applied, including 890 manufacturer households and 356 yarn number households.

### Expenditures are Executed in Accordance with the Budget, the National Treasury is in Good Condition, Currency Reform is Not Yet the Time

[Reported by this newspaper] Xia Jinxiong, Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, told reporters yesterday: At present, the expenditures of the National Treasury are executed in accordance with the budget, and the situation is quite good. As for the income part, if the sale of state-owned enterprises and foreign borrowing are smooth, the situation will be greatly improved. Since the implementation of the measures for the deposit of public funds of military and political organs in November last year, remittances have almost all been done, but deposits have not been fully withdrawn and deposited in the Central Bank because various organs have long-term relationships with other national banks, and they must be withdrawn before they can be deposited. At present, the general economic situation has been effective since the implementation of the new economic plan, but from a long-term perspective, it still needs to be coordinated with other measures. In terms of travel expenses, there is no proper outlet, and even if it is used for production, it still requires a process of three to five months. In today's securities market, some securities play a role equivalent to chips and cannot be interpreted as investment. It is not yet the time to change the currency system to a gold standard, because the prerequisite for reform is a balance of financial revenue and expenditure. After the First World War, the currency reforms of Britain and France had a preparation period between 1922 and 1925. Countries participating in the International Monetary Fund do not have to adopt the gold standard, because today's international payments are in the form of trade and do not transport gold. As for the abolition of the Four United Offices, it is worth studying. In theory, the existence of this system has both advantages and disadvantages. While the strength of the Central Bank is not strong enough, the Four United Offices should still be retained. Regarding the requisition of deposits in the United States, Xia believes that under the political system and national conditions of the United States, it is difficult to become a reality. Furthermore, Xia was summoned by the Ministry of Finance and was heard to have boarded a train to Beijing last night.

### Overseas Remittance Amounts Increase Fivefold in February

[Reported by this newspaper] The total amount of overseas remittances from all parts of the Bank of China in February reached 8,275,000,000 yuan in national currency. This is more than five times the figure for January. Even if the exchange rate is reduced by three times, it can be seen that the amount of remittances in February exceeded that of January. As for the detailed figures for each place, they are still being settled. However, it is known that the increase in overseas remittances from Nanyang was the most significant in February, and the remittance of funds from the Philippines also started in February.

### Tea Market is Loose

It has been found that various types of domestic sales tea, except for Longjing and Zhulan varieties, have little sales in this street and in Wuxi. The rest are quiet, so people's hearts are powerless to be good, and the market is flat and stable. As for the foreign firm tea market, the market situation of Qimen black tea continues to be exhausted, because the owners of general adjustment funds are still selling, so it still creates opportunities for buyers to suppress prices, and as a result, the market is mostly downstream again. Other export green teas are still tradable, but the process is obviously weak. In this case, the foot of the tea market has frequently revealed a loose appearance.

### Silk Calling Prices are Firm and Stable

The silk market was quite quiet yesterday, and the calling prices were generally firm and stable. No. 120 High Mountain Glossy Rayon opened at 6.45 million yuan in the morning and closed at 500,000 yuan at noon. It shouted a sale of 450,000 yuan in the afternoon and revolved between 450,000 yuan and 500,000 yuan all day without much rise or fall. There were many arrivals of Western silk from the place of origin, such as No. 75 semi-gloss and No. 100 non-gloss, all of which are simply ten goods, each with 200 pounds of net silk. The former called a price of 11 million yuan, and the latter was priced at 8.2-300,000 yuan. The calling price of the factory Jing was similar to that of the previous yesterday, and D grade was traded at 7.05 million yuan yesterday. The second-hand goods were slightly active, and the Dachenggeshibi was called for 17,000 yuan, and traded for 6,800 yuan. The price of rayon feather yarn was 5,400 yuan, and the sales were quite good.

### Smuggling Situation of Chinese Merchants Improves

[Reported by this newspaper] It is understood that recently, the smuggling situation on the Chinese side has gradually improved since the authorities dispatched two more teams of military police to patrol the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and two patrol ships to take charge of the sea inspection work. It is understood that in the past, smuggled goods in that area mostly relied on armed protection and were mostly equipped with sophisticated weapons. Now, as the authorities have increased the strength of the anti-smuggling team, the wind of smuggling has gradually disappeared.

### China Farmers Discuss This Year's Tea Loan Today

The China Farmers Bank will hold a meeting at 4:00 PM today to plan this year's tea loan, inviting the China Tea Association, the Tea Export Association, and the Southeast Tea Area United Association to listen to opinions and conduct preliminary discussions. According to tea merchants, the highest peak of this year's production is expected to be 1.4 million dans, and the number of tea merchants in various places will also increase to 1,600.

### Gallnuts are Firm

[Reported by this newspaper] Due to frequent price increases in the place of origin and scarce arrivals, the market for Du Wu and Tong Pei rebounded again yesterday. Tong Pei was 350,000 yuan per Sima Dan, and Du Pei was 360,000 yuan, an increase of about 40,000 yuan compared with the previous week. According to industry insiders, Pei Fen cannot be exported recently because domestic sales are widespread and the price difference between domestic and foreign prices is too large.

### Introduction

The Economic Weekly, Volume 4, Issue 12, has been published on schedule, including Ji Chongwei's "The Future of Commodity Prices After Emergency Measures," Wu Chengxi's "On the Chain of Commodity Prices and Commodity Price Control," and short local communications, industrial and commercial introductions, literary excerpts, etc.

### General Wang Yaowu's Style in Shandong

— Jinan, 14th, Air Dispatch, Our Special Correspondent, Li Tian

In February of last year, General Wang Yaowu, who had been serving as the Commander of the Fourth War Area in Hunan, was appointed by the conference as the Commander of the Second Pacification Zone, commanding the Shandong battles. He was personally seen off to Jinan by He Yingqin, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army. At that time, in Shandong, apart from larger strongholds such as Jinan, Qingdao, Weixian [Weifang], Gunzhou, Dexian, and Tai'an, 85% of the province's area was in the hands of the Communist army. When Wang Yaowu arrived in Jinan, apart from the staff of the former Fourth War Area Command, it was a time when the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks were loudly advocated. Military movements were not permitted by the agreement. Not only could he not bring his so-called well-trained troops from the past, but even the special service regiment of his guards from the Fourth War Area era was not allowed to enter Shandong.

At that time, in Jinan, there were only the two divisions of the 12th Army and the 96th Army, which were equipped with old equipment. In Weixian and Qingdao, there were only the 8th Army (newly equipped) and one division of the 96th Army. In addition, there were a few local teams that lacked both supplies and ammunition. Their fighting power was so weak that Chen Yi, Commander of the Shandong Field Army District of the Communist Party and concurrently Commander of the New Fourth Army, who was ordered by Yan'an on March 1st to come to Jinan to negotiate with Commander Wang on how to implement the ceasefire order, bluntly and impolitely said to Commander Wang:

"Your troops are all second- and third-rate troops, and their fighting power is completely unreliable. If we want to prepare to attack Jinan, we can take it down at any time."

Chen Yi's attitude was quite arrogant. Commander Wang replied without hesitation and very clearly: "Indeed, my troops may be second- or third-rate troops, but you must know that after being trained by me, Wang Yaowu, these second- or third-rate troops will become first-rate troops within a month!"

Four Main Reasons for the Shandong Situation

The main reasons for the entire Shandong situation evolving to the difficult state it is in today are due to: (1) The Communist army began operating in Shandong since the July 7th Incident [1937]. Until the eve of victory, except for the transportation lines and cities controlled by the Japanese puppets, almost the entire province was in their grasp. At this time, the Communist army's strength had already expanded to nearly 200,000 men. (2) After the victory, the central government sent General Li Yannian to lead the 12th Army and the 96th Army from Fuyang, Anhui into Shandong. Because of the long journey and the need to remove obstacles from the Communist army along the way, they only arrived in Jinan on the Double Tenth Festival of the 34th year of the Republic [October 10, 1945]. Before this, local teams and miscellaneous troops in various places competed to take over. Roughly calculated, although they took over about 80%, because the command was not unified, there was no talk of cooperation. The Communist army, with its superior position, naturally had the advantage of being the first to take the spoils. Thus, by means of individual attacks, they took over again from the takeover units, resulting in the land and materials seized from the enemy puppets, except for a few cities such as Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang, falling into the hands of the Communist army again. (3) Li Yannian implemented the central government's downsizing policy too strictly, reducing the original guerrilla teams and local forces that had been eroded by the Communist army in Shandong for eight years to nothing. Conversely, in the past year or so, the regular Communist army in Shandong has expanded from 200,000 to 439,300 men. If the troops transferred from the Northeast are included, it would be no less than 500,000 men. (4) Most importantly, the three ceasefire orders on January 13, June 8, and November 11 of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], which were actually only unilateral obligations of the National Army, caused the National Army to miss many valuable opportunities and become a situation of passively taking beatings. Conversely, the Communist army took the opportunity to isolate the National Army's strongholds, hard-attack and soft-eat, and defeat them one by one. Among them, the key points of Dezhou, Tai'an, and DaWenkou were captured by the Communist army within ten days after the second ceasefire order on June 8 of last year. If these three key points had remained in the hands of the National Army, it is unknown how much unnecessary sacrifice and loss would have been reduced today in opening up the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

### Chen Yi Failed to Capture Jinan and Admitted "Head-on Collision"; Wang Yaowu Opened Up the Jiaoji Railway in 100 Days

Commander Wang Yaowu came to Jinan in such a grim situation and handled the Shandong situation under such a premise. The difficulty of his task and the burden on his shoulders, in the 38 provinces of the country, who could find a second province with a more serious situation than this? But Commander Wang did not complain about it. On the contrary, he silently led his excellent staff, first organized a cadre training class, and trained middle and lower-level officers below the regimental commander in stages, ten days per term, focusing on political awareness, thereby improving morale. The trained officers, after returning to their units, further trained their subordinates. In political training, there was also military training. From the training, Wang recognized the main officers of each unit and understood the capabilities of each unit. Thus, in deployment, he chose their strengths and assigned them appropriate tasks. The effect of the training was great. In less than two months, the original demoralized troops became vigorous, and their combat power increased at least five times compared to before. From the end of May to mid-June, Chen Yi launched more than 100,000 troops to besiege Jinan, fully believing that these second- and third-rate troops could be easily captured. Unexpectedly, after besieging for more than 20 days, apart from suffering losses, he gained nothing. Chen Yi then realized Wang Yaowu's prowess and believed that Shandong had indeed reached a "head-on collision" situation. Chen Yi, a Communist army commander whose highest guiding principle for combat was "not attacking fortified positions," naturally retreated in the face of difficulty.

In late June, the 54th Army landed in Qingdao, and the 72nd Army was transported by air to Jinan. From the beginning of July, Commander Wang was ordered to begin a self-defensive counterattack. He used his original three armies plus these two armies, a total of five armies, with the most flexible and ingenious deployment, making the Shandong Communist army feel like they were in a fog, not knowing that he had thousands of troops. Thus, he unfolded his grand strategy, opening up the 394-kilometer Jiaoji Railway from the isolated strongholds of Jinan, Qingdao, and Changyi within 100 days (before the Double Tenth Festival). The railway bureau also stepped up repairs, completing the miracle of opening the entire line to traffic on December 16.

Brilliant Achievements; Explicit Order Concurrently in Charge of Shandong Administration

On October 22nd, when Commander Wang was supervising the troops in Weixian and advancing into Yexian, the Executive Yuan passed his concurrent appointment as the Chairman of Shandong Province, succeeding He Siyuan. Commander Wang had no knowledge of this beforehand. On the 25th, he returned to Jinan from Weixian, and on November 1st, he officially held the inauguration ceremony. At the end of the same month, he went to Beijing to report on his work and seek instructions on the reorganization of the provincial government. As a result, Wang Yaowu did not recommend a single private individual to the reorganized Shandong Provincial Government. The Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Liu Xiang, the original Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, was introduced by Chief of Staff Chen. The Director of the Finance Department was recommended by the Ministry of Finance. The Directors of the Education and Reconstruction Departments were not changed. Even the position of Secretary-General was reassigned to Liu Daoyuan, the former Director of Civil Affairs, who had no connections with him. Not only that, but the first move of an ordinary provincial chairman would be to place a private individual in the most practical and inconspicuous position of the provincial financial institution, such as the General Manager of the Provincial Bank, but Wang did not change even this most basic point. On the first day of his inauguration, the three major goals of his administration were: (1) Talentism, (2) Selflessness for the Public Good, (3) Using the spirit of "Knowing and Acting Immediately, Bearing Hardship and Resentment, Achieving Oneself and Others, and Finishing What is Started" as the guiding principle for administration.

Clear and Decisive Style; Officers and Soldiers United and Simple

His original command had people from all provinces, but Shandong people were few, and Hunan people were the most numerous. This was in stark contrast to the style of former Chairman He, who emphasized local factionalism, the so-called "Cao Family Gang" (He was from Caozhou, i.e., Heze County) and "Four Central, North, and Columbia" (He's academic qualifications). Because Wang himself was also from Shandong, Shandong people always hoped that he would use more local people. Thus, one time, a local elder asked him, "Why are you using so many Hunan people?" Wang smiled and replied, "As long as Shandong people are capable, I will use them just the same."

Commander Wang does not love money. Not loving money does not mean that he does not want money. He still wants the money that should be wanted from above. He said that without money, things cannot be done. But every penny he asks for must be used on his subordinates and on the cause. Usually, the surplus of ordinary troops is the natural possession of a few high-ranking officers, but Wang Yaowu used this money as a public accumulation fund for the troops or institutions, used to run children's schools, veterans' schools, and veterans' factories, used as special rewards for subordinates during the New Year and festivals, and subsidies for poor and sick subordinates.

Commander Wang gives people the impression of being clear, sincere, and courteous. His personal life is simple, unadorned, and serious. He has no hobbies and often spends his spare time walking and reading. He hates corruption the most. When he first arrived in Jinan, it was when the takeover personnel were busy "robbing and taking over," but he strictly ordered his subordinates not to participate. His handling of everything emphasizes practicality. For work, he is especially good at managing time. Every day, from morning to night, he always has something to do and can arrange the urgency and priority of things very well. Since taking over the administration of the province, he has changed to governing in the morning and managing the military in the afternoon. He likes to ask questions and learn. There are many experts and scholars among his staff, who are always available for him to consult and ask for advice. His subordinates, infected and influenced by him, all have the same style as Wang. Not to mention the middle and lower levels, even at the high level: in the military, from Luo Xingli, Zhao Ruhan, Wu Yuan, Long Chuyun, Qian Baiying to Li Kunzhi; in the civilian field, from Liu Xiang, Zheng Xiran, and Fan Qijun to Liu Maohua, they all give the same impression of being warm, sincere, and courteous, without any bureaucratic style, living a simple and serious life, without any decadent atmosphere, working diligently and practically, without any procrastination. Over time, this style naturally becomes a trend. This trend is unprecedented in the large and small institutions in half of China that the reporter has come into contact with in the past ten years.

Three-Year Program; Laying the Foundation for Democracy

Regarding Wang Yaowu's political achievements in Shandong, because the military situation has not yet fully unfolded, it seems too early to talk about performance. However, the three-year administrative program of the Shandong Provincial Government promulgated by Wang on New Year's Day this year not only laid the democratic foundation of Shandong in politics but also laid the democratic foundation of Shandong in economy at the same time. Article 22 in the outline: "Resolve land disputes, protect tenant farmers, support owner-farmers, earnestly implement rent reduction measures, and realize land to the tiller," is the most powerful example.

In conjunction with the administrative program, Wang Yaowu also convened a Shandong Provincial Pacification Zone Political Affairs Conference on January 8th and 9th of this year. All responsible persons at the county level and above from the Party, government, military, and groups attended. The conference made concrete and detailed decisions on how to carry out pacification work in the future and how to compete with the Communist Party in politics. Because it has not yet reached the time when it can be published, it cannot be introduced in detail here. But one thing is worth mentioning is that at this conference, the past method of dividing county-level units into five levels based on population, tax revenue, etc., was abolished, and it was re-divided into the following five levels, namely (1) Controlled Areas, (2) Semi-Controlled Areas, (3) Stronghold Areas, (4) Mobile Areas, (5) Occupied Areas. All local administrative personnel, except those trained in the provincial cadre training corps, are not allowed to stay in the safe areas near Jinan, as in the past, waiting to come to the provincial government to collect their salaries, but must go to their work posts to carry out their work. This is the only way to coordinate with the military. In order to implement and carry out this resolution, in the past two months, one commissioner and four county magistrates have gloriously sacrificed their lives.

### "The Cattle and Horses of Shandong People Eat Grass and Squeeze Out Milk"

From the 20th of the previous month, the great battle in central Shandong broke out. Due to an error in decision-making on the part of someone, the estimation of the Communist army's strength was too low, and the commanders of the troops were too careless and lacked vigilance. A coincidence of various factors allowed the Communist army to gain some small advantages in central Shandong. In order to preserve their strength, the National Army, in addition to ensuring the three strategic points of Jinan, Qingdao, and Weifang, had to make a strategic retreat on most of the Jiaoji Railway. The 24 counties and cities on the Jiaoji Railway that Commander Wang had worked so hard to manage for a year were only left with eight counties and cities. Although this responsibility was not actually Commander Wang's, Commander Wang still recorded it in his own account. Conversely, he did not take credit for his brilliant measures to ensure Jinan! When the situation in central Shandong was tense, Jinan was actually just an empty city plan. But Chen Yi, based on Commander Wang's prestige and past lessons, although his large army on the north, south, and west sides had all reached within about 20 kilometers of Jinan, he had to wait until the Communist army in Zibo had digested Commander Wang's only remaining capital, the 12th Army and part of the 96th Army, before daring to attack frontally. It was also under Chen Yi's excessive caution that Commander Wang, with a preemptive and decisive attitude (at this time, because he was facing the most critical moment, he could no longer and had no time to ask for instructions from above), withdrew all the troops in the Zibo and Zhangdian area to the periphery of Jinan within 24 hours. In this way, he not only preserved the 12th Army and the 96th Army but also stabilized Jinan. Chen Yi found nothing in Zibo and then realized that he had been fooled, but it was too late. He could only watch the city of Jinan lying at the foot of Thousand Buddha Mountain and comfort himself by saying, "'Head-on collision' has arrived again!"

Although the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be completely opened up in a very short period of time, the cleansing of the overall situation in Shandong still seems to have a relatively distant distance. Although opening up the Xuzhou-Jinan section can temporarily allow the people confined in Jinan to breathe some fresh air, most of the people in the entire province are still in dire straits. If the overall situation in Shandong is not cleared up for a day, and if the people of Shandong are not truly liberated for a day, Commander Wang will not be able to sleep soundly for a day. Commander Wang usually sleeps only five hours a night, and only four hours when the war is tense. Even these few hours are often disturbed by the telephone. He personally has no extravagant enjoyment. When there are guests, it is four dishes and one soup. When there are no guests, it is only one dish and one soup. Therefore, he often says when he speaks, "I came to Shandong to be a cattle and horse for the 38 million people, not to be a bureaucrat." Under his sincere inspiration and hard work, the people of Shandong also said in unison, "Wang Yaowu is indeed the cattle and horse of the Shandong people. The cattle and horse work all day long, eat grass, but squeeze out milk."

### Dehui After the Disaster

— 16th Dispatch

On February 21, the Communist army began to launch 200,000 troops, taking advantage of the unfrozen ice, to cross the river and invade, attempting to control the stronghold and threaten Jilin and Changchun. Therefore, they attacked with four divisions of troops, and then with four infantry regiments, two artillery regiments, and eleven tanks, and more than 80 mountain and field guns of "75" and "88" caliber, launching a fierce attack.

The reporter's truck passed through the periphery of Changchun and went straight to Mishazi, which is a powerful stronghold connecting to Changchun. The Communist army had also passed through here once. Mishazi Station and all the buildings around Mishazi Station were burned down by the Communist army. According to the local people, the Communist army only stayed here for one or two days, but burned down 400 houses and pulled away fifteen trains of soybeans. Along the way from Mishazi, all the railway tracks were torn up and the utility poles were mostly cut off. From Lao Jia to Xi Hai, about seventy li, the railways and utility lines were almost completely destroyed. Their destruction technique is truly amazing. They turned the rails on the original roadbed upside down, the sleepers facing up, and falling to the side. In addition, there were also some sleepers burned, and all large and small bridges were blown up, about seven of them. Hala Ha also suffered the same fate, fifteen trains of soybeans were pulled away, and more than five hundred houses were burned down.

In this battle, the Communist army occupied the villages around Dehui and set up artillery positions, intending to turn Dehui into scorched earth and launch a so-called spring offensive, but this attempt has already become a bubble.

### On Writing Book Reviews

— Yang Tongfang

Recently, when I've been with friends, we often discuss the question of "how to write book reviews." We demand the flourishing of the publishing industry, so we must demand that excellent book reviewers write good book reviews for readers. There are no fixed rules in writing, which everyone knows, so how could writing book reviews be an exception? Generally, a good book review must reach the point of fulfilling the task of a book reviewer. Therefore, judging the quality of a book review depends on whether that review can fulfill the duties that a book reviewer should perform.

Some say that a literary person must have the ability to fully express their thoughts, and a scientist must clearly organize the systematic problems or conclusions of their research in their works, but a book reviewer does not need to have such cultivation. This view is indeed incorrect. Literary criticism is about life, while literary book reviews are about criticizing literature, one being a direct criticism of life, and the other being an indirect criticism of life. Literary book reviewers often express the author's personality in the work, which is no different from literary creators expressing the personality of characters in their works. As for the main task of scientists is to reveal the truth and provide accurate knowledge, while scientific book reviewers are to criticize the truth revealed and the knowledge provided by the original author, one being a direct revelation of truth and provision of knowledge, and the other being an indirect revelation of truth and provision of knowledge. Scientific book reviewers often make a general introduction to the truth revealed and the knowledge provided by the original author, which is no different from scientists writing about the truth and knowledge they have gained from their research. A true literary book review can also be called a form of literary creation on the other hand. A true scientific book review can also be called a scientific work on the other hand. Literary book reviews were initially used as a tool for studying literature, but later became not only limited to being a tool but also a form of literary work. Scientific book reviews were initially used as a tool for studying science, but later became not only limited to being a tool but also a form of publishing scientific knowledge.

Whether a literary book reviewer or a scientific book reviewer, they themselves should be a good reader. To make oneself a good reader, one must have the ability to read, understand the content and value, and seek conclusions. However, one cannot harbor any prejudice and should regard criticism as a tentative, objective, and relative conclusion, and should never force readers to believe with subjective thoughts. To write good book reviews, one must first thoroughly understand the author of the original book and their thoughts, and recognize one's own research and discussion as a continuous process of progress. Book reviewers should adhere to the correct level of commentary, provide their opinions on a certain book, and use it to encourage others to read the original book.

A clear and keen eye for appreciation is what book reviewers should also possess. Especially for literary criticism, one must fully express the ability to appreciate art. Brook said: "Literary critics should immerse their entire heart in the author's heart and truly achieve the point where they can appreciate the work, and must not fail to understand the author's thoughts and the essence of their work." In modern literary criticism, there is a type of appreciation criticism, which focuses on striving to understand and savor the nature, achievements, and value of the work, not subject to ethical or instructive restrictions, and far from the perspective of actual interests. An excellent book reviewer must undergo a certain amount of artistic cultivation in addition to scientific methods and philosophical spirit. Needless to say, literary works should be studied with an appreciative attitude, and even the discovery of certain scientific masterpieces must be approached with an appreciative attitude.

American writer Leo Markun said: "The person who writes book reviews should use all their heart and soul, including their humor, memory, and imagination." It can be seen that a good book review must be written naturally and clearly, otherwise it will make readers feel dull and boring. Markun also strongly warned against the "formulaic" nature of book reviews. Indeed, those book reviews we often see are extremely boring, always with that same set of forms and styles, failing to arouse readers' interest. I think that any book review that can be written in a lively, fluent, fresh, and concise style will surely arouse readers' interest. Remember: a good book review is itself a good article, and it has a unique value in itself. Book reviewers must not ignore this point.

B. General Review

(1) The number of books in the General Category is small, and there are no major original works, such as encyclopedias or dictionaries, published in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China.

(2) In the Ethics category of Philosophy and Science, there is a lack of writings on children's life guidance.

(3) In the Educational Science category, there is not a single reference book for university professors, primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, or home teachers. Whether to be a teacher is another matter. As a teacher, and as a teacher in a world power, what kind of mind, what kind of conscience, what kind of mouth, and what kind of hands should this teacher have? It seems necessary to ask experienced teachers to write something out for us to repent. However, a quarter of the eighty-seven educational science books are rules for ball games.

(4) Although the number of works in social science this year is less than that of literature, the number of writers is several times that of literature. There are no detailed works on financial management and public finance this year, which seems to be quite necessary considering the national conditions.

(5) In terms of artistic works, there are no special books on sculpture, architecture, printing, etc., and there is not a single relatively laborious work in music.

(6) Writings in natural science feel scarce. There is a lack of guidance books in astronomy, and no natural history books are published at all. The only book on botany is a translation. There are fifteen types of physics and chemistry, mostly for high school students, and none of them are related to national defense.

(7) Twenty-six types of medical books have been published in this juncture, which is not too little. There is no research on DDT. Once politics is slightly on track, the number of books on industry and small crafts will definitely increase greatly.

(8) There is a big difference between the number of English and Russian books, but from this, we can also see the nation's ...

(6) There is a lack of folk literature in the literature category. After this disaster, compatriots from the north, south, east, and west have been exchanging like shuttles. If life can be a little more stable, there will be leisure to write something out for the people to appreciate. Publishers often do not indicate the style of the book, which is related to business.

Ba Jin and Mao Dun are creative. However, it is unknown to the author whether they each have more than ten works in the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China. In the above statistics, they each have a certain number, which seems to be that the publishers repeatedly take old books as new books to fool the public.

(10) There are a total of 188 books in the history and geography category, which cannot be considered small in terms of quantity and percentage. Chronicles and biographies of Chinese and Western great men have made contributions. The only thing missing is archeology books. There are considerable historical materials about this war being published, but unfortunately, most of them are copied from others, and there are no special books about how we resisted, how we moved west, and how we won.

C. Proportion of Publications

Now let's talk about the achievements of the publishers. The above 1,461 books are published by more than 80 bookstores. Among them, the most on track publishers are Commercial Press and Zhengzhong, with Commercial Press accounting for more than 11% of the total number of new books, ranking first.

Finally, the percentage of books in each subject is listed below as a conclusion:

General Books 28 Titles 2%

Philosophy and Science 92 Titles 6%

Education 87 Titles 5%

Social Science 343 Titles 23%

Art 38 Titles 3%

Natural Science 64 Titles 4%

### On American Foreign Policy

— Xinjun

Written by Lippmann, Translated by Luo Yinpu, Published by Da Shidai Bookstore

Today, the relationship between China and the United States is so close that American goods and troops can be encountered anytime, anywhere. However, although the relationship is so close, the general public's understanding of the United States is too lacking, or it can be said that most of the Chinese people do not recognize it clearly. As a Chinese person, this phenomenon is extremely shameful.

A country's foreign policy is its guiding principle for foreign relations, so to understand the United States, it is necessary to first understand its foreign policy. The American policy toward China in front of us certainly does not yet have a special book, and it is also quite difficult to see clearly. For its basic and normal foreign policy, an outline can be seen in this book.

This book is mainly for the American people and is known as the basic reading material for American foreign policy. In this book, Lippmann carefully and rigorously points out how the American people should establish a foreign policy that balances "strength" and "responsibility."

The author's plan is needed by the American people and even more hoped for by our people—it is very beneficial for us if the United States has an excellent and normal foreign policy.

The translator explains that Lippmann's proposition is "to form a core alliance after the war by Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China (if China becomes strong), and to gather other countries around this alliance to form a universal new international order. Under this order, all small and weak countries enjoy safety and freedom, and countries are free from causing conflicts..."

Such a new international order is not only hoped for by China, but also waited for by the people of the whole world!

Although the author still has many shortcomings in some places, the translator has pointed them out, so understanding its shortcomings and then reading this book, its value is still there.

The author himself explains: "My main argument is that the American foreign policy, which was generally sound for most of the nineteenth century, became dangerously unsound after 1900... My argument, as the reader will see, becomes a harsh criticism of American foreign policy during this period..."

Indeed, the author is standing from a critical standpoint to deal with his treatise.

In this treatise, the author first explains the purpose of the book, and then describes the basic principles of foreign policy. These two items tell the reader an understanding of his book and foreign policy.

Then, it broadly discusses: (1) America's "Foreign Responsibility"—America's continental border, the Western Hemisphere, the Pacific, the transition period of the new and old centuries; (2) The Bankruptcy of American Foreign Relations—The foreign policy of President Theodore Roosevelt, the foreign policy of Wilson, the collapse of American foreign policy, Roosevelt's position before the war; (3) Illusions—"Peace," "Disarmament," "Opposition to Entangling Alliances," "Collective Security"; (4) America's Position; (5) The Victorious Countries of the Atlantic Group, the British-American Connection, elements; (6) The Soviet Union and the United States—past, future, interests, and the relationship between the two countries in the Pacific; (7) China and the United States—the connection between China and the United States, the instability in East Asia; (8) A Universal International Order—the core alliance, and its reasons, conditions.

The author wrote the above eight items with his rich experience. After reading it, one can clearly understand the general outline of American foreign policy in the past.

### Late-Blooming Rose

— Huran

Written by Storm, Translated by Ba Jin, Published by Wenhua Shenghuo She

Ba Jin selected and translated three novels written by Theodor Storm, using the medium-length novel called "Late-Blooming Rose" as the book title, and included it in one of the Culture and Life Series he edited himself. The other piece is "Malte and Her Clock", and the medium-length novel "Bee Lake". "Bee Lake" was translated by Guo Moruo many years ago, called "Inmeng Lake", and this novel is very popular among young readers.

I haven't read many of Storm's works before. However, in the few articles that have already been read, the impression he gives is Qingli and concise. He, unlike British and American writers, likes to make the scene tense and lively, or insert small, detailed descriptions. In terms of plot alone, it is also quite plain. In addition, his writing style is slow, which makes it feel the most relaxed when reading. However, it is also for this reason that his works lack the power to inspire life. Storm expresses this in "Late-Blooming Rose", which is a bit like the evening sun, reflecting on things in memory. Although beautiful, it is, after all, a falling glow, a kind of twilight melancholy, a kind of realization, often adding a new sorrow to the worried and sensitive heart.

In "Malte and Her Clock", he describes an old maid who lives alone in her small house. There is no one to accompany her except for a "talking" clock and some old furniture. Malte spends a long time in this cloak. She did not feel lonely or bored. He was kind and faithful, and loved the relatives and tenants he knew. However, until one Christmas night, she suddenly felt different. In the clock sound of answering, she recalled the things she had experienced in her life, her sorrow, her little Guangle, some beautiful things suddenly poured into her already old mind, raising her head. She felt: "It was almost completely dark all around, and there was only a dim moonlight outside, lying on the snow. Apart from the sound of the clock, the house was as quiet as death. There were no children's songs in the small house, no frying sounds in the kitchen, only she was left in the house, and everyone else was gone." Malte was at a loss.

"Late-Blooming Rose" tells the story of a middle-aged man "trapped in a network of careers", mechanically passing his days, neglecting other things. Inadvertently, his young wife is gradually withering beside him, although she is still very gentle and harmonious. Until one day, on his birthday, he suddenly discovered that a gift his wife gave him was a profile of a girl; that is, a portrait of herself when she was young; that amazing coquettishness and precious youth made the rude husband feel guilty; he felt that he had neglected his wife. At this time, he realized that youth is short-lived, and the late-blooming rose only has a moment of beauty. He seemed to feel that he had lost something—because at the bottom of love, there was only the last bit of nectar left, it was already too late.

These two novels have no tortuous plots, and the structure is also very simple. When viewed as a group, it is often difficult to grasp the theme. People who like to watch stories really can't find stories here, but only in the afterthoughts can they appreciate what kind of atmosphere the author has arranged, containing What is the real meaning.

However, in "Bee Lake", we can see more moving pictures, detailed descriptions, and the arrangement is also very clear. At the beginning of the story, Reinhard is already very old. One night, in front of the bronze statue of his former lover, he relived the simplicity of his youth: when he was a child, he fell in love with the beautiful Elizabeth in his hometown; later, in order to seek further study, he went to the city to study, and during the two years, he also returned once, and Elizabeth was still his only companion; but shortly after he returned to the city, he also got the news of Elizabeth's engagement, she had agreed to Eric's request according to her mother's wishes, and Eric was Reinhard's good friend, he was honest and extremely rich, and the houses in the Bee Lake area were managed by him. A few years later, Reinhard passed through this beautiful land and met Eric. Eric was very happy and immediately invited him home, enthusiastically treating him as an honored guest. Of course, he would definitely meet the lover who would always fascinate and hurt him - Elizabeth has not changed from before, still light and soft, but unfortunately her heart has become dull and dull; in the few days of reunion, they also had a pleasant gathering; they sang folk songs together in the spring evening, and the green grass by the lake also left traces of walking; although there are no bayberries that can be found in the children's games, although Elizabeth has become someone else's wife, and although Reinhard can't write a single poem anymore; the indulgent gathering is still fragrant; they can be regarded as spending a short spring - before the seasons have changed, Reinhard had to leave the beautiful Bee Lake and return to his lonely journey.

Works like those written by Storm are difficult for ordinary readers to accept. Ba Jin mentioned in the "Postscript": "I don't want to introduce it to a wide audience, but for some tired souls, Da Qingli's writing style, simple structure, and pure emotions may bring a little comfort." In fact, it is indeed the case. Now that we introduce this small book to readers, it also has its own intentions; the choice of materials for creation does not allow us to stay in a small cage, pleasing the general idle class of readers with bizarre fantasies and flowery rhetoric, but we cannot erase the works that reveal true feelings with one stroke, thinking that they are boring, superficial, and unworthy. This world, despite being absurd, is still a "human" world. We need everything that is full of "human touch", and our emotions need more irrigation and growth in many aspects. A majestic chorus or symphony can bring about a surging tide of emotions, which can make people feel a big shock when they are in a coma; however, a serenade, a few low solos, has a unique value, often making people linger endlessly and contemplate repeatedly.

Life needs the tempering of fire; the soul needs the baptism of fire; but Storm's novels, which are similar to prose, are like a small stream, flowing past under your feet, will you hear it?

### Random Chats from Solitude

— Wang Cong

The habit of Shanghai citizens is to like going through the back door. The front door can be said to be a door that is set up but rarely opened. Someone might ask: "Why is this?" I say: "This is the so-called 'Rather flatter the King of Qin than the King of Chu.'" At this time and in this place, finding a gentleman who doesn't take shortcuts is indeed a difficult task.

Looking at going through the back door—what Qu Yuan called "the narrow path of expediency"—one can extrapolate to larger political aspects.

If we examine history, many upheavals have originated from eunuchs and relatives of the emperor. This has been the case since ancient times.

The Analects record Ji Kangzi asking Confucius about governance:

"If one were to kill the wicked to promote the virtuous, what would you say?" The question was asked very straightforwardly. If it were Zhang Xianzhong, he would definitely say directly: "Kill! Kill! Kill!"

But Confucius, who constantly spoke of the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean, put on the face of a schoolteacher and said: "If you desire good, the people will be good. The virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, the virtue of a commoner is like grass; when the wind blows over the grass, it will surely bend."

This argument seems progressive, as if the social atmosphere depends on the political system.

However, when Confucius reached the end of the Investiture of the Gods, he couldn't help but chant in a low voice: "Confucius is about to start killing." So, within a few days of taking office, he killed his political opponent, Shaozheng Mao. Confucius' virtue was not like the wind over the grass.

Naturally, righteous gentlemen would explain it as "acting on behalf of Heaven."

Can a small apricot-yellow banner completely cover up Song Jiang's "benevolent and righteous" cunning?

I'm afraid it's like the story of Queen Victoria of England, if my memory serves me correctly. Niu told me this way.

The wise Queen, because she was diligent in politics, only returned to her bedroom late at night. Her husband, a certain prince, was already asleep, and the bedroom door was also closed.

The sound of knocking on the door—

"Who's there?" the prince asked from the bed.

"Her Majesty the Queen!" the Queen answered from outside the door.

The prince turned over impatiently and started sleeping again. After waiting for a while, the Queen knocked on the door again—

"Who are you?"

"Her Majesty the Queen!"

Both voices were louder.

"I'm asking who you are?" Annoyance filled his tone.

The clever Queen suddenly used her light and gentle voice to say:

"Me? Your wife."

Then, the door opened quickly. The prince embraced this wise ruler of the generation and said forcefully: "I am unwilling to open the bedroom for anyone at this late hour; if I do, it is only for my wife."

I can't help but think of the story in Romance of the Three Kingdoms:

It seems that when Liu Bei sought an audience with Sima Hui, he recited a long list of official titles to the young gatekeeper. Unfortunately, this young gatekeeper did not have the cultivation of an official. He was just loyal and said indifferently: "Sir! I can't remember such a long and rambling list."

With just this one sentence, the young gatekeeper was wiser than this peerless hero.

Those lords who only know themselves and not others, who look in the mirror all day long, should not proudly recite their high positions and generous salaries to the suffering people.

### World Professional Women's Day – A Record of their "March 18th" Celebration

— Hei Xing

This was a magnificent gathering. Due to the splendid and dazzling lights, and the elegant, aristocratic attire of the noble ladies and misses, I sensed the luxurious and graceful atmosphere that should be present in the salon of aristocratic women.

I am not exaggerating excessively about that aristocratic-style evening party; they had all received a good education and had a good social standing. Most of them could speak fluent English and wore decorations that were not too flashy but extremely elegant. They included women of nearly ten nationalities—there were British, American, German, Russian, and, of course, mostly Chinese. Using an international language, they spoke of peace and of maintaining Sino-American friendship.

Laughter filled the entire auditorium. The colors of the clothing and the beauty of the hair, in this kind of international gathering where high-class women purely express their education and thoughts, revealed their graceful and beautiful figures.

They immersed themselves in the sweet and joyful atmosphere of this annual "World Professional Women's 20th Anniversary Celebration." Some people prepared songs and dances, and some prepared their long speeches.

These are all things that require a long period of education to be able to show one's talent.

As a reporter, I sat behind their seats. These women of various nationalities, beneath their light furs and heavy makeup, were all extremely elegant and wealthy.

Male guests were extremely rare. I only saw an American military photographer, two or three Chinese police officers, and a few laborers and servants. They all stood by the wall, without seats.

The memorial ceremony that day began with a dinner, followed by speeches. The chairman was Dr. Ma Yueqing, and there were about two speakers, Dr. Ma Zhu Juefang and Mrs. Bai Yuehan.

There were several entertainment segments, including a chorus of "The Mountain is in the Vague Distance," Miss Yang Xiaoyan's dance, Miss Qi En Geng's solo, Miss Zhang Renqing's solo, and so on.

A list of the classifications of professional women who attended that day is attached here: Customs had the most, with thirty-one people. The post office was second, with thirty people. Y.W.C.A. had twenty-nine people, banks had nine, musicians had eight, the Executive Yuan had seven, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) teachers, the United States Information Service, and nurses all had five people, oil companies had four people, import and export firms had four people, the Central Trust of China had two people, the Young Women's Christian Association had two people, and doctors and accountants each had two people, the water company had two people, and more than ten other people.

Finally, it should be noted that World Professional Women's Day is March 18th, and the professional women of Shanghai usually hold a celebration. This year's venue was the Bank of China Building.

It is hoped that future Professional Women's Days will be able to more broadly absorb women from all walks of life and allow them to speak out about their inner pain and difficulties in life, and that they can receive practical help.

Only then can this conference truly be in-depth and universal, and also contribute to mutual understanding and the establishment of world peace.

### Drinking Fire Order

— Hu Lu

Fire City

Formerly called Foreign City, today transformed into Fire City, the sound of alarm bells is heard from time to time, the more housing is scarce, the more disasters occur!

The stench of charred corpses is everywhere, every household is frightened, continuous disasters have ruined myriad homes? The poorer you are, the more merciless it is; the more broken the fire equipment, the more powerful the god of fire!

### In Memory of Grand Master Taixu

— Xu Ye

Grand Master Taixu, whose ancestral home was Chongde, Zhejiang, with the surname Lü in secular life, understood the Four Emptinesses in his youth and took refuge in expounding Buddhism. As he grew older, he developed a spiritual connection, diligently studied the Vinaya, and researched the teachings and views of the Tiantai and Huayan schools, achieving profound mastery. Subsequently, he traveled around the world, traversing the globe. He had just arrived from Yin County at the beginning of the month and suffered another stroke on the 12th. After all medical treatments failed, he passed away at one hour and fifteen minutes in the afternoon of the 17th, at the age of fifty-nine.

The Grand Master was an eminent monk of the present age. In addition to Buddhist studies, he was also proficient in Western philosophy and literature. With insightful vision and foresight, he pioneered the great and lofty ideas of reforming Buddhism and religious friendship, and his writings numbered over a hundred.

The Grand Master cultivated himself with a breadth like the sea, possessing kindness and gentleness. The pine breeze and water moon were insufficient to compare to his purity. He devoted himself to learning all day long, meditating and returning to emptiness, transcending the world. He was truly a living Buddha of this age.

The Grand Master propagated the doctrines and teachings throughout the country and abroad. In his life, he had traveled to Japan, the United States, England, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, France, India, Myanmar, and other countries. Wherever he traveled, various universities invited him to lecture, and newspapers and magazines competed to publish his words and deeds. He was the first person to transmit Chinese Buddhism to Europe and the United States. Moreover, he had extensively propagated the Dharma and transformed beings in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Tibet, with disciples throughout the world, both Chinese and Western. Contemporary scholars and famous figures such as Kang Youwei, Zhang Taiyan, Zhang Jian, Wang Yiting, Zou Haibin, Grand Master Yinguang, Grand Master Panchen, Zhang Yiceng, Li Genyuan, Dai Chuanxian, Liang Hancao, Yu Bin, Tagore, Gandhi, Nehru, and others often associated with him.

Chairman Jiang and the Grand Master were friends of transcendence, and their friendship was deep. Amidst his myriad tasks, they had mutual exchanges, discussing learning and studying scriptures, enjoying their conversations, and occasionally sharing vegetarian meals, accompanying each other on mountain and river tours, discussing the world and the nation's affairs intimately. In the 17th year of the Republic [1928], he followed Chairman Jiang's invitation to Beijing to lecture on Buddhism, which was well-received by the government and the public. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he moved with the government, calling on Buddhist youth to rise up and protect the country. He also formed the Buddhist International Visiting Delegation to promote the central government's policies of resistance and nation-building, gaining praise and sympathy from the Allied nations. Furthermore, he used Buddhist power to transform border residents to be inward-looking. On New Year's Day of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], the National Government awarded him the Victory Medal as the leader of religious figures.

The Grand Master was currently the President of the Paris World Buddhist Academy, a Director of the Chinese Buddhist Association, the President of the Shanghai Buddhist Academy, a Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Buddhist Association's Rectification Committee, and the President of the Sound of the Sea Tide Monthly Magazine. Throughout his life, he presided over famous mountains and monasteries, and the Buddhist academies he founded in various places were also famous far and wide. His outstanding disciples, such as Dharma Master Daxing, Dharma Master Zhifeng, and Dharma Master Fushan, were all well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning, with excellent insights.

Now that the Grand Master has returned to the Western Paradise, his legacy will last forever. The Buddhist community has lost a teacher, and the academic community has lost a master. I am deeply saddened by the Grand Master's passing, but the world's admiration for him is a cause for celebration for China.

### Confession of a Coolie

— Yang Si

The High Court re-examined the case of coolies sent to Japan killing their companions. According to reports, the defendant and witnesses described the cruel treatment they suffered at the hands of the Japanese. As the defendant's lawyer said, it was a vivid picture, good material for a film, and good evidence for judging the crimes of the Japanese.

The defendant said that he "was transported by the Japanese to Kagoshima, Japan, to work as a coolie, leading twenty-three companions. Each person only had seven ounces of rice to eat each day, and there was no rice, mostly bean cakes, potato skins, and other miscellaneous things. Also, because the North Sea was extremely cold, with snow more than two feet thick, the companions all slept in tattered cotton and straw. Under these conditions of hunger and cold, five or six out of ten companions died."

One witness said: "The coolies in Japan had to scramble to eat the fish bones and meat bones left over by the Japanese. The coolies could not bear the abuse of the Japanese, so there was no reason for them to beat each other."

Just reading these two paragraphs is enough to make one's heart feel heavy. In the distant North, so many compatriots were working as coolies under the whips of the Japanese. Hunger and cold caused them to die one after another. The cruelty was worse than in the battlefield. They were silently dragged away and silently died. Fortunately, those who survived were sent back without a word of complaint. They will eventually take this unexpected suffering and sleep peacefully underground, as ignorant Chinese people. In this chaotic world, their suffering is neither known nor recognized.

However, suffering did not make them numb. On the contrary, they have gained considerable awareness. The words of that witness are knowledgeable, and broadly speaking, they are also a fact.

It is a pity that "those with the same illness do not sympathize with each other." Regardless of whether the defendant killed his compatriots under the oppression of the Japanese, it is true that he was accused by his companions after returning. This fact can also be viewed broadly, and it is enough to make one's heart feel heavy.

### Literary and Art Circles

— Feng Qian

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the writer Li Liewen resigned from his position as the president of the Fujian Reform Publishing House and went to Taiwan to serve as the deputy editor of the Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily. In the autumn of last year, he was dismissed by Chen Yi for some reason, and lived in leisure in Taipei, focusing on translating foreign literary works. During the "February 28th" incident, he suffered from false alarms, but fortunately was not injured.

The Japanese novel "Newspaper Seller" by Yang Da, which exposes the Japanese oppression of the Taiwanese people, has been translated into Chinese by Hu Feng. Recently, a Chinese-Japanese bilingual edition has been printed in Taiwan, which is very popular among readers and has been reprinted three times.

Taiwanese writers mostly write in Japanese due to educational reasons. After the victory, a Japanese-language novel was published, "Ho Chi Minh" by Zhang Luoyin, which describes the distress of a Taiwanese youth who was educated in Japan and turned to the embrace of the motherland. It is aimed at the current problems of Taiwanese youth. Others, such as "A Taiwanese Youth's Last Cry" (the author's name has been forgotten), are angry accusations against the current situation in Taiwan, which have been well received by readers in Taiwan.

Cultural groups organized by Taiwanese writers and cultural figures include the "Taiwan Cultural Promotion Association," which is located in the Taipei Zhongshan Hall and publishes a monthly magazine called "Taiwan Culture." The association is abbreviated as "Taiwan Wenxie."

### A Scene from "Mysterious Lady."

This film will soon be released at the Cathay Theatre. The entire film depicts the scandalous and secret life of a beautiful woman.

### Record of a Dangerous City

— Qin Shouou

"I'll do as you say!" Xu Shaoming tapped the bowl a few times with his chopsticks. "I'll tell Ah Shi to get it right away! Please sit down, let's talk more!"

Old Zhu nodded, still sat down, and while Xu Shaoming was talking to Ah Shi, he turned back to smile at Lan again; Lan shook her head at him, her expression not very happy, as if she very much disapproved of him using this method on Old Xu. Of course, he couldn't tell her immediately that he was just teasing Old Xu, he could only smile at her again.

"But, Old Zhu, you can't joke with me," Fatty Xu was not without vigilance. "If Jin Aili doesn't come tonight, and my check bounces tomorrow, don't blame me!"

In fact, Zhu Zhaonian had already been confident.

"Okay! But, you have to pay attention," he tapped the table twice with his hand. "Tonight I can only accompany her to talk to you for a while. When to let her come live with you here, it's better for you to decide for yourselves!"

Fatty Xu was overjoyed and immediately drank another big gulp of Moutai; then Ah Shi brought in a book of Bank of Communications checks, Zhu Zhaonian immediately snatched it into his hand, and took out his own pen, handing it to Fatty Xu, urging him like he was pressing for debt to sign a check for 450,000 yuan. In the middle, he couldn't avoid several rounds of bargaining.

"Okay, okay, take it!" Finally, the fat man handed the check to Old Zhu, saying regretfully: "It's just that you are not as good as Old Zhong in this point! He's also a good friend of mine, but he never advises me to spend this kind of unseemly money!"

"Yes, yes, you are absolutely right!" Old Zhu hid the check, saying nonchalantly: "That's why Old Zhong can also open movie theaters and be a boss just like you."

"Old Zhong has really made some money in recent years. Hahaha! Who's like you, a fool?" Xu Shaoming smiled so that his eyes narrowed into a line, and at the same time quickly picked up his wine glass and drank a big gulp. After all, four or five hundred thousand yuan was a small matter for him, and once the check was handed out, his heart no longer ached.

Now, Zhu Zhaonian's thoughts were very chaotic. Although the donation matter had been satisfactorily resolved, the preparations for the retreat of all the staff of the theater troupe had not yet begun, and his sudden reunion with Lan in a different place at this time had added a big problem to him; also, how Jin Aili should be settled was also quite thorny for him.
