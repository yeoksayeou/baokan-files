### Striving to Promote Five-Nation Cooperation, Strengthening the Traditional Friendship Between China and the United States: Minister Wang Reports on Foreign Affairs at the Council

[Our Nanjing Office, 22nd] The National Political Council held its third plenary session on the morning of the 22nd to hear Minister Wang Shijie's report on foreign affairs. The session began at 9:15 AM, with Chairman Li Huang presiding. Deputy Secretary-General Lei Zhen reported that 281 councilors had registered, and 214 attended on the morning of the 22nd. Minister Wang's report was followed by a question-and-answer session, and the meeting adjourned at 12:50 PM. The fourth plenary session was held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, with Jiang Yong presiding. During the session, Gu Zhenggang gave a report on the work of the Ministry of Social Affairs and briefly answered written and oral questions. Subsequently, a vote was held to elect two chairmen to succeed the retiring chairmen of the presidium. After a ten-minute break, the meeting continued at 5:25 PM, with Xie Guansheng giving a report on judicial administration work and answering oral questions. The meeting adjourned at 7:40 PM. The fifth plenary session on the morning of the 23rd will cover the financial report, and the sixth plenary session in the afternoon will cover food, agriculture, and forestry reports.

[United Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Foreign Minister Wang reported to the National Political Council that China had proposed that after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union should jointly administer Japan for 20 to 30 years. The United Kingdom and the United States have expressed their agreement, but the Soviet Union has not yet responded.

[Our Nanjing Office, 22nd] Foreign Minister Wang gave a report on foreign affairs at the National Political Council on the morning of the 22nd, addressing the following four major areas one by one: (1) the Japanese issue, (2) relations between China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, (3) the Korean issue, and (4) the protection of overseas Chinese. Regarding the Japanese issue, Wang pointed out that Japan had been our greatest enemy in the past, and this issue will not only affect our country's future but also the welfare of the world, so it must be approached with caution. Our basic policy towards Japan can be summarized in the following three points: (1) strict military control to ensure that Japanese aggression does not re-emerge, (2) political leniency, not interfering in Japan's internal affairs, and (3) economic measures to enable Japan to maintain a reasonable standard of living. The issue of Japanese reparations is being discussed by the Allied nations. There is no agreement among the countries on how to handle Japanese assets abroad. Regarding Japanese assets within Japan, the United States has decided to first take out 30% for China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and other countries, and our country will receive half of that. We have already sent personnel to Japan to handle this matter.

When discussing the relations between China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France, Wang explained that for the sake of China's interests and the world's interests, cooperation among these five major countries is a necessary condition. The goal of our foreign policy is to promote coordination and cooperation among the five countries, and we do not want our country's situation to affect the relations among the five countries and endanger the future of the world. Regarding Sino-American relations, our consistent policy is to strengthen the traditional friendship between the two countries. This friendship is the purest and should not be changed by criticism or jealousy from any party. Wang deeply admired General Marshall's assistance in repatriating three million Japanese prisoners of war in China, and he believes that the conclusion of the Sino-American commercial treaty will greatly benefit the promotion of trade relations between the two countries. Regarding future economic assistance from the United States to China, Wang said: Our current need for American assistance is extremely urgent, and the United States is the only country that can assist China. At this time, not long after the end of the war, when the economy is in dire need of recovery, external assistance is needed for both industrial and commercial construction. This matter is currently being studied closely by China and the United States, and a more detailed report cannot be given at this time.

### Strict Implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, General Satisfaction with Relations with the United Kingdom

Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, Wang stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles Sino-Soviet diplomacy based on the resolution of the previous National Political Council to "strictly implement the Sino-Soviet Treaty," and strives according to the principles of non-concession and non-subordination. Regarding the withdrawal of 700,000 to 800,000 Soviet troops from Northeast China, the Soviet government telegraphed our country last year, stating that they had been completely withdrawn by May 3rd of last year. Regarding the issue of Lushun and Dalian, the Soviet side stated that because the peace treaty with Japan had not yet been signed, the area was still in a state of war and we could not send troops there. Our country believes that the war against Japan has effectively ended. Currently, the Soviet side has agreed to our first sending an inspection team there, and the military and police issues are still being negotiated by both sides. Wang finally mentioned the "unpleasant incidents" at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference and explained that after our solemn statement, the conference did not discuss the Chinese issue, either internally or externally.

Wang then briefly reported on Sino-British and Sino-French relations, stating that Sino-British relations were generally satisfactory. The British side's draft of the Sino-British commercial treaty has not yet been sent. Regarding the recovery of Hong Kong and Kowloon, the British government has stated that it has abandoned its imperialist policy. If we can work to strengthen and deepen the relations between the two countries, the issue of Hong Kong and Kowloon should not be difficult to resolve. As for Sino-French relations, the main issue is the protection of overseas Chinese in Vietnam. Regarding the Korean issue, Wang stated that we wish to see an independent Korean government established as soon as possible. Finally, Wang gave a detailed explanation of how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handles the protection of overseas Chinese. The report lasted a total of one hour and forty minutes, and its clear and detailed analysis was met with enthusiastic applause.

After a ten-minute break, the conference continued at approximately 11:10 AM, first listening to written inquiries, totaling 34 items, mainly concentrated on (1) Japan (including the issue of reparations), (2) China and the Soviet Union, especially the issue of Lushun and Dalian, (3) China and the United States (including loans), (4) the recovery of Macau and Hong Kong, (5) the protection of overseas Chinese, and (6) diplomatic personnel, six major issues.

### Important Issues to be Discussed, Handled According to Plan: Foreign Minister Wang's Concise and Pertinent Answers

After the written inquiries were completed, oral inquiries were conducted, with eleven speakers, mostly addressing Wang's report and asking about the Japanese issue. Zheng Kuiyi believed that the three basic policies declared by Foreign Minister Wang needed to be revised. He pointed out that a democratic Japan cannot be realized as long as the emperor system is not abolished. The council requested last year that the Japanese emperor be listed as the number one war criminal. Why has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not proposed this to the Allied nations? If we allow Japan to take advantage of international contradictions and rearm under the guise of democracy, then the day Japan makes a comeback will be the day the September 18th Incident is re-enacted. Zheng also called for strict handling of Yasuji Okamura and others who are still living freely in our capital. Chen Yaodong proposed that we cannot allow Japan to restore its 1937 standard of living, as that was the period when Japanese industry was most developed. Chen Baoyin, with his qualifications as an expert on Japan, reminded the people of the country that the Japanese have always regarded themselves as descendants of the gods and have always despised our country. This kind of erroneous mentality should be eliminated. Regarding the point of not interfering in Japan's internal affairs, Chen believed that the United States is carrying out a rectification movement in Japan, and we should actively participate.

The issue of Sino-Soviet relations was also a focal point of inquiries. Chen Yaodong believed that our failure to send personnel to the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement was a great failure. After eight years of sacrifice in the War of Resistance, our international status has plummeted, which is truly heartbreaking. In addition, Lushun and Dalian have not yet been recovered, and our representatives on the committee formed by the two sides are fewer than the Soviet representatives. Continued efforts in diplomacy are necessary. Pan Chaoying brought up some facts that have not yet been made public and hoped that they would be explained one by one. He advocated that some international treaties should be abolished, while Xie Mingxiao had even more radical proposals.

Yan Shutang advocated that diplomacy should be independent and autonomous and should not adopt a policy of using one country to control another. His catchphrase was, "Only by being close to China can one be close to foreign countries. We should be close to those who are close to China." He also said, "Diplomacy should transcend party affiliations and should not take party interests as its interests, but should take China's interests as its interests. Based on the above interests, when we conduct diplomacy, we should not listen to Moscow or Washington, but should listen to the people of our own country. We should shake hands with those who are beneficial to us, and reject those who are not, and we should not be constrained by diplomatic rhetoric and etiquette." Zhou Qianchong also expressed the same opinion, saying that after our country's long war, it cannot withstand a third world war. If China's diplomacy causes China to become a battlefield of the Third World War, then it will not only be a criminal against the world, but also a criminal against humanity.

He Baoren, regarding the issue of protecting overseas Chinese, questioned the diplomatic authorities about what effective measures have been taken in response to the threats to the lives and property of overseas Chinese, and hoped that a proper solution could be found for the overseas Chinese issue. He pointed out that the restrictions on remittances to overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies are extremely strict, so that some overseas Chinese only have enough money to eat one meal a month from the remittances they send back to support their families.

Zhou Qianchong and others raised questions about the diplomatic personnel system. Zhou hoped that the authorities could establish a reasonable system and that there could be ideal talents to cooperate, because the diplomatic arena is like a battlefield, and the battlefield needs strategists to cooperate, and the diplomatic arena also needs diplomats to cooperate.

### The Key to World Peace Depends on Whether Cooperation is Possible

After the inquiries were completed, Foreign Minister Wang gave oral answers, first stating that he would pay attention to the various questions raised by the councilors. He then turned to the councilors and asked whether our country's foreign policy should be changed or whether it should follow the old patterns. Wang pointed out that the world needs peace, and China needs peace. In this age of the atomic bomb, peace is especially needed. However, what is the key to peace? The key to peace lies in whether China, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and other countries can cooperate. If there is a mistake in this matter, the future is difficult to imagine. This is not alarmist talk. Our diplomatic authorities will not abandon their efforts to promote peace at this stage, and they will not do anything that would cause an uproar because of our actions. We should be patient where we should be patient, and speak when we should speak. A gentleman loves people with virtue. When we should speak, we should not remain silent. We hope that the people of the whole country can support the government's policy. Wang pointed out that taking another path is not difficult, but he fears that if we do not delve deeply, we will face danger. This is something that must be pondered deeply. Wang pointed out that there are currently about 13 or 14 important diplomatic issues that need to be resolved. The authorities have plans and steps to deal with these issues. Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, during the war, 11 million people died directly from the war, and the direct property loss was 51.1 billion US dollars. We are making just and fair demands. In the future, in addition to machinery and ships, whether there is still a need for production facilities has been studied in the past few months. Regarding the issue of protecting overseas Chinese, we cannot send troops everywhere, and foreign countries also have different laws. Some countries do not even have treaty relations with our country. The authorities can only truly intervene. Wang concluded by saying: The authorities do not have the absolute certainty to solve all of the above problems one by one in a short period of time, but they will still work hard to do so, and hope that all parties can trust them. The answer lasted a total of seven minutes, and it was concise and pertinent. The meeting adjourned at approximately 12:50 PM.

### The Successors to the Two Chairmen of the Presidium are Announced

Lin Hu and Zhang Junmai

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] At the fourth meeting of the National Political Council on the afternoon of the 22nd, a vote was held to elect successors to the chairmen of the Presidium. Councilors Xiao Yishan, Zhou Qianchong, Liu Zhongyi, Zhang Aizhen, and other four councilors supervised the voting. As a result of the election, Lin Hu and Zhang Junmai were elected as chairmen of the Presidium.

### Our Inspection Team to Lushun and Dalian Reportedly Departs at the End of the Month

[Our Shenyang Office, 22nd] The Lushun and Dalian inspection team will depart no later than the end of May, and will depart from a certain place by military transport. The candidates are Dong Yanping, Zhang Jianfei, Wang Zhuting, Wang Qiamin, Zhu Xinmin, Qiu Yin, Wang Yuantong, Wu Jiaofu, Xu Zuxi, and other nine people.

[Our Shenyang Office, 22nd] Regarding the issue of the national army stationing in Lushun and Dalian to assist administrative personnel in taking over Lushun and Dalian, our government is still negotiating with the Soviet side. It is heard that the Soviet side no longer insists on its previous views on the issue of stationing troops, but believes that Lushun and Dalian are still in a military period, and urged us to first establish a mixed military committee.

### Ministers of Social Affairs and Justice Reply to Councilors' Inquiries

[Our Nanjing Office, 22nd] The oral inquiries to the report on social affairs at the National Political Council on the afternoon of the 22nd were generally about relief issues, labor and farmer issues, and the issue of the number of legislators from professional organizations. Pan Chaoying believes that the Ministry of Social Affairs can contact religious organizations and local charitable organizations in various regions to handle social welfare work and relief work.

### Farmers are More Important than Industry and Commerce, Rural Areas are More Important than Cities

Zhang Qianhua emphasized that farmers should be more important than industry and commerce, and rural areas should be more important than cities, but the opposite is currently true. Zhang Yishan further emphasized the government's neglect of farmers, believing that organizing farmers requires technology. It is not possible to approach farmers just by wearing Zhongshan suits or Western suits. The main thing is still to integrate with the farmers, and he hopes that the government can pay attention to this. Zhu Huiqing raised the issue of the number of legislators from professional organizations, believing that the number of legislators from professional organizations stipulated in the Legislative Yuan election law, which has been decided and passed, is only 56, and the proportion is not appropriate. Zhu believes that in both the National Assembly elections in 1931 and the National Congress elections in 1937, there was a proportion of one-third or more. Why is this the case this time? Is this the standard set by the Ministry of Social Affairs? He would like to ask Minister Gu to answer. Fu Baochang proposed that the 10 to 15 million refugees in the Shenyang and Sipingjie areas and the skilled workers who have been displaced in various places should be protected and relieved. Gu Zhenggang's reply briefly stated that, regarding our country's labor policy, it is planned to wait until the Asian Labor Conference to be held in our country next year and then formulate our country's labor policy based on the decisions of the conference, which would be more reasonable. Regarding relief, it is the responsibility of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has no right to allocate it. Even the refugees in Northeast China are handled by the Executive Yuan Relief Administration because the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs has already been withdrawn.

### The Issue of the Number of Legislators Will Soon be Reconsidered

The issue of the number of legislators from professional organizations is based on the 380 vocational representatives among the 1,105 members of the National Congress, and was originally planned to be 119. Later, the Legislative Yuan discussed and decided to change it to 56, and the National Defense Supreme Commission requested the Legislative Yuan to reconsider and change it to 119. It is heard that the Legislative Yuan will soon conduct a reconsideration.

### Lu Qian Raises Questions About Zhou Fohai's Exemption from the Death Penalty

[Our Nanjing Office, 22nd] Xie Guansheng gave a report on judicial administration at the National Political Council from 5:40 PM to 6:20 PM. At that time, the councilors had successively left the meeting, and there were few listeners. The report cited several written reports and began oral inquiries. The important ones included Lu Qian raising the issue of Zhou Fohai's commutation of the death sentence. Lu said: "The matters refuted by the Zhou Fohai verdict have all become the reasons for commutation in the pardon order. If the latter can be established, then the court's verdict should not be established. If the refutation is established, it cannot be used as a reason for commutation. The two must be one or the other. Government decrees and laws should not contradict each other." Lu also pointed out the corruption in the reporting of traitors. Chen Yaodong raised the issue of the extraterritorial rights of the US military in China. Cases such as the Zang Da's son case were all handled by the US military court, which is related to China's judicial sovereignty and should be paid attention to. Secondly, the treatment of judicial personnel should be improved. After graduating from the judicial group of the university and the law department, why can't they take the certification examination to become judicial officials? Zhang Bangzhen also mentioned the improvement of the lives of judicial personnel. Zhang also inquired about the case of He Dehui, the secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Why was it not properly handled? Luo Heng also raised a solemn question about the He Dehui case. Luo said that this is the dignity of the national law, and He Dehui's case of being a traitor is really unforgivable. Peng Ge Chen pointed out the corruption of local judicial organs, which has almost become an institution for doing evil. Xie then replied item by item, stating that Zhou Fohai's case was legitimate because the National Government was authorized under the National Government Organization Law to grant pardons.

### US Military in China Did Not Overstep Their Authority in Handling Cases

Regarding the issue of the handling of criminal cases by the US military in China, if Chinese soldiers commit crimes in the United States, they will also be handed over to the Chinese military court in the United States for judgment. Regarding the certification examination for graduates of university law departments and judicial groups, it will be resolved soon. As for the He Dehui case, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was only investigating on the orders of the Executive Yuan and could not prosecute him. However, He was serving in Shanghai at that time and was entrusted by the government, so he should not be punished as a traitor. After the reply, Luo Heng stood up again and inquired, believing that judicial dignity must be maintained, and expressed his protest to Xie. However, at this point there was still a written inquiry, and there was not enough time to reply, so the adjournment was announced.

### The Basic Work of Protecting Overseas Chinese is to Sign Friendly Treaties with Various Countries

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Minister Wang explained the work of protecting overseas Chinese at the National Political Council, believing that our revolutionary basic policy is to show sympathy to nations striving for liberation and freedom. This is a must for followers of the Three Principles of the People, and for the permanent interests of our overseas Chinese, we should also adhere to this creed. Because our overseas Chinese in the Nanyang area must live in harmony with the local people in order to continue to develop their industry and commerce. Recently, wars have broken out in East India and other places, and the situation of our overseas Chinese is extremely dangerous. The policy and efforts of our government are to demand that both sides in the conflict give protection to the overseas Chinese and provide the overseas Chinese with the convenience of self-defense. Some places already have self-defense organizations. The basic work of protecting overseas Chinese at present is still to sign friendly treaties with all countries where overseas Chinese reside, so that overseas Chinese can obtain most-favored-nation treatment under the treaties. A considerable number of such treaties have been completed in the past year. The Sino-Thai Treaty, the Sino-Philippine Treaty, and the new treaties signed between China and some Central and South American countries are all of this nature. With the basis of treaties, the work of protecting overseas Chinese can be gradually advanced.

### Full Text of Zhang Qun's Report (Continued from Yesterday)

On August 8 of last year, General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart jointly issued a statement stating that a peaceful settlement was difficult to reach. The government also reiterated that "the government will continue to seek a peaceful settlement, and negotiations can be held at any time." All of this is enough to show that the government always keeps the door open for peaceful negotiations. General Marshall's eight trips to Mount Lu in the hot summer are enough to show the enthusiasm of the mediator.

In early October of last year, when the national army attacked Zhangjiakou, the CCP requested a cessation of the attack. The government agreed to a ten-day period and expressed the maximum concessions it could make to resolve the current situation, while the CCP insisted that the ceasefire should have no time limit. General Marshall and Ambassador Stuart again issued a statement on October 8, explaining the importance of resolving all political issues peacefully, "but some issues that need to be resolved immediately are difficult to reach an agreement," and pointing out that "what kind of nature the local government in these demilitarized areas should be is more difficult to solve than the redeployment of troops." In order to seek a turnaround in this stalemate, the government again proposed eight understandings to the CCP on October 16, making the greatest concessions in order to order a ceasefire and convene the National Congress as scheduled to formulate a constitution. On October 21, representatives of the various parties gathered in Nanjing again, and the atmosphere of peace talks was very strong for a time. People from the third party were even more active in running around and putting forward compromise plans. However, Yan'an fundamentally opposed it and insisted on suspending the National Congress as a condition for restoring peace talks.

In order to compromise, the government issued a cease-fire order again on November 8, and ordered a postponement of the National Assembly, which was originally scheduled to be held on the 12th of the same month, for three days, so that the CCP had a final chance to consider it. All of these experiences are sufficient to fully show how the government sought peace talks and how much it valued the enthusiasm of third-party people who were running around for the country. Unfortunately, all efforts and hard work have not yielded results, which is a deeply regrettable thing!

After the National Congress, the CCP stated that there were two prerequisites for restoring peace talks: one was to dissolve the National Assembly (later changed to abolish the Constitution), and the other was to restore the military positions before January 13 of last year. Since then, the CCP has been pulling the distance of peace talks farther and farther, but as long as the government has a glimmer of hope, it will not abandon its original intention of cooperating with the CCP. In the process of consulting with the Youth Party and the Democratic League on reorganizing the government, everyone felt that if the CCP issue was not resolved, if the CCP did not participate in the government, China's problems would still not be fundamentally resolved. The Youth Party and the Democratic League were willing to make another joint effort with the government for peace talks. In mid-January of this year, the Standing Committee members of the two parties went to Beijing for talks and agreed on four proposals for restoring peace. The government prepared to send Mr. Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to discuss with the CCP. Unexpectedly, the CCP rejected it. The government still entrusted the US ambassador to convey this proposal to Yan'an and issued a public announcement to inform the world (the original text of the proposal is omitted). This proposal was announced on January 20, and on January 25, Lu Dingyi, the Propaganda Minister of the CCP, issued a statement that, in addition to rejecting peace talks, he also wantonly slandered the head of state. The situation has reached this point, and although the government's desire to resolve internal disputes by political means is as sincere as ever, the government's path of striving for peace talks has come to an end. Since then, the CCP's expression has been to deny all the government's international actions to the outside world, without leaving any room for negotiation. The CCP should be responsible for the failure of the peace talks, and the facts are obvious. The government cannot unilaterally cease fire, nor can it unilaterally make peace, but later when the government reached an agreement with the Democratic League and the Socialists on the policy guidelines, it still decided in the fourth item that "the CCP issue should still be resolved politically as the basic principle. As long as the CCP is willing to have peace and railway transportation is fully restored, the government will seek domestic peace and unity by political means." Therefore, today's problem is not whether peace talks should or should not be held. The CCP does not express its willingness to have peace. No matter how lively we talk, what good will it do? Chairman Jiang reiterated the government's position on the CCP issue in his speech at your meeting yesterday. All of you gentlemen are very concerned about this issue, but how can we make the CCP turn back and make a political solution possible? As long as it does not interfere with the national need for unity, democracy, peace, and construction, the government is determined to give the most sincere consideration. (To be continued)

### Random Notes from the Political Council

— Our reporters Yu Zhenji and Zhang Ming

On the 22nd, Foreign Minister Wang gave a report on foreign affairs to the Political Council. The report lasted a total of one hour and forty-four minutes. The most detailed report was on the Japan issue, lasting twenty-eight minutes. The U.S. issue lasted eighteen minutes, the Soviet issue fourteen minutes, and the British and French issues five minutes each. From the length of time, one can see the general importance that our foreign affairs authorities place on each issue.

When Wang reported on Sino-American relations, he only mentioned two foreign names, namely MacArthur and Marshall. Wang greatly admired Marshall, pointing out that Marshall's contribution to mediating peace, although awaiting judgment by future historians, cannot be denied in his assistance in repatriating three million Japanese expatriates and prisoners of war. When reporting on Sino-Soviet relations, Wang used extremely solemn language and a particularly soft tone, making it somewhat difficult to hear, but everyone present listened attentively. Wang once mentioned the three words "unpleasant" in his report.

The generally noted Xisha Islands and Macau issues were not mentioned in the foreign affairs report. When reporting on Sino-Korean relations, the atmosphere of the entire venue visibly relaxed. At this time, newspapers from our publication and from Beijing and Shanghai were being distributed in the venue, and the councilors were busily reading them. A female councilor from Taiwan was audibly snoring. During the ten-minute break, the councilors chatted. Huang Yuren and another councilor criticized the content of Wang's foreign affairs report. Shanghai councilors Wang Xiaolai and Xi Yushu discussed whether dancing should be prohibited. Photography reporters were actively moving around, and Xie Bingxin, newly returned from Japan, became the best subject. In the written inquiries, some used classical Chinese, while others used vernacular Chinese. Zhao Xuefeng questioned, saying that "the authorities have contracted myopia and astigmatism, and have been greatly fooled by a certain country." The generals who raised oral inquiries in the second general meeting yesterday mostly stood by with their hands in their sleeves today. One person said, "Everyone should sing the good parts; if it's always just a few people talking, people will get tired of listening."

During the oral inquiries, Jin, the president of National Central University, Chen Dong, spoke the most fiercely, painfully pointing out that after the abolition of unequal treaties, new unequal treaties had arisen, and after the abolition of extraterritoriality, there was new extraterritoriality. After speaking for the full five minutes, he continued to speak eloquently, severely criticizing the "proud masterpieces" of some people.

New terms emerged endlessly. "Defeatism" and "tailism" could be heard from time to time. Praising terms could also occasionally be found. A certain councilor praised Foreign Minister Wang as a "world diplomat." After hearing this, Wang wanted to "laugh" but couldn't.

He Baoren cited examples to illustrate that due to the extremely strict restrictions in some colonial countries, the money that overseas Chinese remit to their home country each month for family support is only enough for one meal, and in some places, it is simply impossible to remit money.

The person who received the most applause today was Pan Chaoying. He mentioned the behavior of the "big noses" in the Northeast and advised some people not to be delusional. He also had strong opinions on the Macau issue, believing that "if we can't even deal with Macau, what's the point of talking about the U.S. and the Soviet Union?" The entire venue responded with warm applause.

Yan Shutang had the best speaking posture. When talking about foreign attitudes, Yan said that when dealing with "countries that harm us, we should extend our fists and fight to the end." As he spoke, he forcefully struck the table with his fist, causing the teacup to jump up. When Foreign Minister Wang replied, his attitude was extremely sincere, repeatedly saying, "It's not that I don't dare to take responsibility," and saying, "I am willing to humbly seek advice." In just seven minutes, he overcame a difficult obstacle. Ye Gongchao, who came with him, also breathed a sigh of relief.

When the meeting was held on the afternoon of the 22nd, there were few councilors present. Comparatively, there were more reporters than councilors. Someone said that reporters could occupy the position of attending to politics, and if councilors were absent, those attending to politics could fill in.

Too few people listened to the judicial and administrative report, seemingly indicating that the Chinese people do not abide by the law, do not love the law, and are not very interested in the law. However, the councilors who were lawyers did not leave and listened very attentively. When Gu Zhenggang reported, his tone was sonorous and he gesticulated wildly, almost making people think he was conducting a symphony.

In the afternoon venue, newspapers were quite "popular."

Liang Shuhan entered and exited the venue four times. The first time he came in very late, sat down, and looked at the seating chart with great interest. After a long time, he picked it up and left. The second time, he entered from the main door, walked around in a circle, and exited from the side door without sitting down.

Kong Geng and Lu Qian sat in a row. Both had beards, one white and one black. When the two beards met, they had to chat for a while. The white beard was too thin, and the black beard was too fat.

Female councilor Xie Bingxin came for a short while this morning and then left. She came again in the afternoon and left early. A reporter asked if she was doing well in Japan. She said, "There's just nothing to eat, everything else is good." A reporter asked if she was very ill. She smiled and denied it. Mrs. Bu Lizi was present all day today and stayed until the adjournment, even for the judicial and administrative report.

### The Battle in the Yimeng Mountain Area Comes to an End. The Main Force of the Communist Army Suffers Heavy Losses. Seven Columns Are Completely Defeated and Flee in All Directions.

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The large-scale annihilation battle of the main force of the Communist army by the National Army in the mountainous area east of the Mengyin-Qingtuo Temple Highway in the Yimeng Mountain area has now come to an end. Since the 13th, the Communist army, with ten columns and thirty divisions, totaling about 250,000 men, launched a counterattack against the Mengyin Duozhuang and the area north of Qingtuo Temple. They engaged in an unprecedentedly fierce main force battle with the National Army, which was blocking the attack. The Communist army ultimately suffered heavy casualties and was tragically defeated by the 22nd. According to preliminary reports received here, a total of seven divisions of the Communist army, totaling about 40,000 men, were annihilated. The main force of the Communist army suffered such heavy blows that they have lost their combat power. The remnants of their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 7th columns fled northward overnight and have now moved to the Lushan mountainous area southeast of Boshan and the Maling area for reorganization. Therefore, there may not be major battles in the Yimeng Mountain area within three to five days.

[Another dispatch] On the 20th, the National Army in southern Shandong continued to advance along the highway connecting Linyi, Yishui, and Juxian, and divided forces to search for and suppress the remnants of the Communist 7th column in the Suncun Jiehuzhen area southwest of Yiyong. Furthermore, the remaining Communist troops north and east of Tangtou have been completely eliminated. On the 22nd, the mobile corps of the National Army in Mengyin Duozhuang continued to sweep the remnants of the Communist 6th column in the Bizi Mountain northeast of Qingtuo Temple and the Youzugao Li and Liujia River areas south of Tanbu and repair highways.

[Our newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] The war situation in Shandong Province has turned to a quiet state yesterday and today. Both the National and Communist parties are busy adjusting their deployments in preparation for new major battles.

[Our newspaper, Xinpu, 22nd] More than 10,000 Communist troops fled from Hongze Lake to places such as Wujiaji and Xiyu on the eastern border of Shuyu yesterday, attempting to obstruct the harvesting of wheat on the border.

### The Outskirts of Changchun Tend Towards Silence. The Elite Troops of the National Army Cross the Dongliao River to Reinforce. Zheng Dongguo Decides to Go to Changchun to Command Within Days.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] National Army transport aircraft flew here today to airdrop military supplies.

### The Japanese Reparations We Have Obtained Can Build 50 Factories. The Transportation Problem Requires Careful Planning.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The reparations obtained by our country may include more than 480,000 tons of machinery, shipbuilding, steel, light metal, chemical, and power industry equipment. This will cause a huge transportation problem that requires careful and thorough planning. According to a person close to our country's delegation, our government has an almost complete plan, but there are difficulties in gathering a sufficient number of ships, so it is hoping for the return of ships. At the same time, the Chinese government has plans to utilize the reparations. It is estimated that these reparations can be used to build 50 factories, and the remaining machinery will be distributed to existing factories. Among these 50 factories, there will be 19 mechanical factories, 7 power plants, 10 light metal factories, 12 chemical factories, and 2 shipyards. A portion of the reparations transported to China will be port equipment to accelerate loading and unloading and avoid delays similar to those experienced in handling UNRRA materials. Once the transportation work begins, it will be maintained continuously until it is completed, and no materials will be left piled up on the docks to rust. A large number of ships are needed to transport this huge amount of materials back home.

Editorial

### Be Vigilant Against Japan's Rearmament!

When Foreign Minister Wang reported on current diplomacy at yesterday's National Political Council, regarding the Japan issue, he stated: "In order to eradicate the scourge of aggression and ensure lasting peace, our country advocates the complete disarmament of Japan and the strict restriction of any heavy industry that could form the basis for rearmament. In the future, upon the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, it should be jointly monitored by the United Nations." This statement can be regarded as the consistent stance of our government regarding the disarmament of Japan. It is just and reasonable, and the Allied nations should have no objections. However, in recent days, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has suddenly proposed a request to grant Japan a "small military force" to gauge the attitudes of various countries, which deserves our attention.

According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 18th: An official from the Japanese Foreign Ministry recently inquired with people from the Allied nations about their attitude towards the request to establish a 100,000-strong army in Japan to replace the US military and other Allied forces after the end of the occupation. The official emphasized that this army and air force are necessary to maintain internal order, especially to prevent labor unrest and smuggling. Although the Foreign Ministry denied this on the 19th after this news was released, foreign news agencies have recently frequently reported news about Japan rebuilding its military, indicating that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's denial is just a formality that cannot conceal the actual intention.

We are paying close attention to this news. Japan's shocking request, not made on the eve of the Allied peace conference with Japan, but suddenly proposed now for testing the waters, precisely illustrates the failure of the Allied powers' control over Japan and the excessively lenient policy of General MacArthur. At the same time, it shows Japan's careful planning, insidious suspicion, and lack of sufficient awakening. American scholar Owen Lattimore once said: Japan is a "time bomb" that can explode at any time. We Chinese, facing this bomb, have experienced more than half a century of disasters since the First Sino-Japanese War. It has been almost two years since the Allied victory over Germany and Japan, but not only has a peace treaty with Germany not yet been agreed upon, but the convening of a peace conference with Japan is still far off. In the past year or so, Japan has shown many tricks in the cracks of international relations. This time, the revelation of the rearmament request has the strongest smell of gunpowder and the greatest risk of explosion, undoubtedly burying a danger to world peace.

According to the Potsdam Declaration, the Japanese militarist system should be destroyed, and Japan's army, navy, air force, and military industry should be dissolved. However, in the past year or so, the trials of war criminals have been delayed and not judged, and the remnants of the military and the Mitsui and Mitsubishi magnates are still mostly lurking among the people, not having been "purged." On the surface, the Japanese military department has been abolished, the conscription law has also been abolished, a large number of army, navy, and air force personnel have been demobilized, and all military weapons have been almost completely destroyed. However, in fact, Japan still possesses everything needed for a large war machine. What is currently lacking is only raw materials. Due to the contradictions in international relations, the United Nations Far Eastern Commission and General MacArthur in Tokyo have been lenient in their control over Japan, resulting in potentially worrisome consequences. Recently, the Far Eastern Commission decided to allow Japan to retain its industrial production capacity from 1930 to 1932, which is tantamount to having already armed Japan. The peace conference with Japan has not yet been convened, and the United States has already planned to withdraw US troops by June next year. After the withdrawal of the occupation forces, whether Japan should be monitored and whether Japan should be armed are all problems. We Chinese people are naturally most concerned about these issues.

Recently, someone asked MacArthur: "How will Japan protect itself after the US occupation forces withdraw?" MacArthur replied: "One way is to let it retain a small amount of military force." Japanese officials were overjoyed by MacArthur's statement, believing that Japan would be tasked with the mission of a "anti-communist bulwark." Therefore, Japan's request to retain a "small amount of military force" is not accidental; it has been a long time coming, and its intention to take advantage of opportunities to pursue its old dream of militarism is obvious. The development of this situation should be deeply noted by the people of the country, and vigilance should be heightened at all times.

Furthermore, Japan's motivation for establishing an army of 100,000 is to repeat the old trick of Germany building its military twenty years ago, in order to achieve the goal of comprehensively rearming. After World War I, although the Treaty of Versailles disarmed Germany, it did not eliminate the ideology of militarism and allowed Germany to maintain a standing army of 100,000. It used a mercenary system, but did not allow the existence of an air force. German Defense Minister Hans von Seeckt used this standing army of 100,000 to train elite soldiers in rotation, retiring and recruiting every year. In a few years, it became the backbone of the national defense force and the main force for building the military. Hitler's rise, with a roar of anger, turned this force latent among the people into millions and millions of elite soldiers, eventually leading to World War II. If the Treaty of Versailles had completely abolished Germany's military at the time, the course of history would not have plunged mankind into this war. Modern Japan's military system originally imitated Prussia, and Japanese soldiers have deeply studied German military thought and have a particularly thorough understanding of the history of Germany's rearmament. Therefore, Japan's request to retain a "small amount of military force" is actually intended to turn over a new leaf and relive Germany's old dream of expanding its military. We are most capable of recognizing its careful planning. We stand on the position of safeguarding world peace and oppose Japan's request to rebuild its army and air force. We also hope that the Allied nations will convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible and conclude a peace treaty with Japan. Regarding the prevention of Japanese aggression and the subsequent control of Japan, US Army Chief of Staff Dwight D. Eisenhower said: "After a peace treaty with Japan is concluded in the future, the occupation mission should continue; the method is to have an international security force monitor Japan; at the same time, Japan's education should be civilized by the United Nations civil affairs agencies." Eisenhower's views are very correct. We believe that if the Allied nations can take this step, they can prevent the re-emergence of aggressor ideology. We hope that the Allied nations will seize the opportunity and thoroughly prevent the revival of Japanese militarism!

### Everyone is Responsible for Stabilizing Society

The Shanghai Municipal Government, in conjunction with the Garrison Command, yesterday formulated four measures to maintain public order, and Mayor Wu also announced his four wishes to reporters. We believe that whether these measures can be earnestly implemented is the key to whether public order in this city can be maintained. Since the authorities have made this announcement, it is expected that they have the determination to enforce the laws, and we will wait and see. We also agree with Mayor Wu's appeal to the community. Because we have always believed that stabilizing society is not only the duty of the government, but also the responsibility of the general public. If the government does not have the cooperation of the people, especially the cooperation of good law-abiding citizens, it will be difficult to exert its effectiveness in maintaining public order. For example, if a theft is not reported to the authorities, or if a person is harmed and not prosecuted, even the most virtuous officials will feel powerless. In an era, if righteousness declines, the virtuous and good hide, and everyone only knows to close their doors and avoid trouble, fearing that falling leaves will break their heads, allowing those violent and domineering groups to act wantonly, society will cease to be society, and the country will cease to be a country. Therefore, the current situation is that a small number of young students have unsettled blood and rash emotions, leading to erratic actions and a lack of reason. We believe that this is not a cause for deep concern. What is most painful is that the general public, who bear social responsibility, either stand idly by or just sigh secretly, and have not yet actively taken responsibility to turn the tide and save the social atmosphere from collapse. If adults are still hesitant and evasive, thinking that getting through one day is enough, unwilling to face reality, distinguish right from wrong, and even more unwilling to stand up and stop the turmoil, it will inevitably lead to a decline in morale and the deterioration of the overall situation.

We want to solemnly remind the people of the country, especially the citizens of Shanghai, that they must support the laws of the national government, respond to the call of the authorities, gather the power of justice, and stop the conspiracy of disruption. Only then can we live and work in peace and contentment, and the country can be built and revived. A critical moment is fleeting!

### Correspondences from Various Places

### Mountbatten Plan Under Secret Discussion; Partition of India Largely Decided; Nationalization of Army Still to be Studied

[Reuters, London, 21st] Authoritative sources say that Prime Minister Attlee and Viceroy Mountbatten have informed Conservative Party leader Churchill, Eden, and Conservative leader in the Upper House, Cranborne, of the plan drafted by the Viceroy to present to Indian leaders on June 2 regarding the procedures for transferring political power in India. Prime Minister Attlee also intends to inform Liberal Party leader Davies of the plan. The Labor government is only informing the opposition parties and not seeking their opinions. The Labor government's actions are entirely proactive, and the opposition parties have complete freedom to take any action. The negotiations conducted by the Viceroy in London are being carried out in an atmosphere of extreme secrecy. Officials have made it clear that the British proposal will not be announced until the Viceroy formally presents it to Indian leaders. Although there is much speculation about the content of the proposal, political figures generally believe that the partition of India is inevitable.

[United Press, London, 21st] Well-informed government sources claimed today that Britain is preparing to divide India into two or more independent countries as a final solution to the Indian problem and to allow at least part of it to retain its status as a British imperial colony. In addition to a Muslim state and a Hindu state, there will also be a Sikh state (a Sikh nation) and princely states (including part of the 562 princely states). This is almost certain because political and religious differences in India are deeply rooted, often leading to violence such as murder and arson, making partition necessary. Colonial Secretary Addison, a veteran politician of the Labor Party, has been summoned to attend cabinet meetings to discuss matters with Viceroy Mountbatten.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 22nd] Ismail, a member of the Indian Army Nationalization Committee, told this agency's reporter last night that the Indian Army may become "Indianized" by June of next year, before Britain withdraws from India. I make this statement based on the results of my investigation. Some senior generals believe that the nationalization of the army will take several years, but I do not think so. The vacancies left by the withdrawal of British troops will be filled by recruiting demobilized officers and civilian technicians. The Indian Army Nationalization Committee is not currently considering the division of the Indian army. This matter will be studied after a joint committee of military experts and politicians is formed on June 2.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 21st] It was recently announced that the report of the Indian Army Nationalization Committee proposes that seven key positions in the Indian Army be assigned to Indian officers, including the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Army, and the Commander of the Army Headquarters in New Delhi. During the war, a large number of Indian officers were promoted to warrant officers, but most of them were specialists, and the Indian commanders of several regiments were lieutenant colonels.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 21st] It is learned that Indian Defense Minister Singh met with the Viceroy before Mountbatten returned home and requested that the Indian Army also be divided into Pakistan and Hindustan. Observers say that this is a tactic of the Congress Party, which still hopes that India can maintain its unity and believes that if the British cabinet understands that the division of India means the division of the Indian army, it will do its best to avoid the division of India.

### All-India Muslim League Leader Elaborates on the Meaning of Pakistan; Advocates a Defensive Alliance with Hindustan; Willing to Establish Friendly Relations with Countries in the Near East and Far East

[Reuters, New Delhi, 21st] Jinnah, the chairman of the All-India Muslim League, today gave a statement to this agency's reporters, elaborating on the meaning of Pakistan as demanded by the Muslim League, and advocating an alliance between Pakistan and Hindustan. The main points of Jinnah's statement are as follows: (1) The Muslim League will request Hindustan to grant a corridor to connect the northwest and northeast parts of Pakistan in India. (2) The Muslim League will fight against the division of the provinces of Bengal and Punjab, regardless of any land area. (3) A truly beneficial relationship can be established between Pakistan and Britain. (4) Pakistan and Hindustan should establish friendly and mutually beneficial relations. (5) The Pakistan government will be a representative government of the people. (6) Pakistan will apply to join the United Nations organization. Jinnah's answers to other questions raised by reporters are as follows:

(Question) How will the army be divided, and is it planned to establish a defense agreement or any kind of military alliance between Pakistan and Hindustan? (Answer) All troops must be completely divided, and I also advocate the establishment of an alliance agreement or treaty between Pakistan and Hindustan to promote mutual benefits and prevent external aggression.

(Question) Even if Punjab and Bengal are divided, do you agree to establish a federation of Pakistani states? (Answer) A portion of the Hindu aristocratic class in Bengal and the Sikhs in Punjab have called for the division of these two provinces. In fact, after the division of the two provinces, it will have extremely unfavorable effects on the two provinces, especially the Sikhs in Punjab, and the aristocratic Hindus in eastern Bengal and eastern Punjab will also suffer great losses. The demand for division lacks careful consideration, and if the British government unfortunately agrees, it will pose a great danger to the future. I have always maintained that Pakistan should be a country that can survive and have strong strength to stand side by side with Hindustan. For this reason, I firmly oppose the division of Bengal and Punjab, and we will fight to oppose it regardless of any land area. (Question) After the establishment of Pakistan, do you still intend to establish a Pan-Islamic state from the Near East and Middle East to the Far East? (Answer) The doctrine of a Pan-Islamic state has long become a thing of the past, but for the sake of mutual benefit and world peace, we should establish friendly relations and engage in cooperation. After the establishment of Pakistan, we should extend a hand of friendship to the Near East, Middle East, and Far East.

(Question) What is the general foreign policy of Pakistan, and do you plan to apply to join the United Nations organization? (Answer) The foreign policy of Pakistan aims to maintain peace and friendly relations with all countries, and we also intend to fulfill our due responsibilities in the United Nations organization.

(Question) Which major country is Pakistan most likely to rely on? (Answer) We believe that the powerful country that is most beneficial to us is actually not a question of relying on any powerful country. At the same time, we should establish friendly relations and alliances so that all participants in this alliance will benefit.

### American Newspaper Comments on the Indian Situation: Partition Will Not Succeed

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Washington Post said in an editorial today that the partition of India will not succeed. If this is implemented, people must move their residences, the scale of which is unprecedented in modern times and difficult to accomplish. Past experience shows that large-scale migration of people inevitably causes great suffering to both body and mind, and only a brutal totalitarian government can do it smoothly. In the past, those who drafted the Treaty of Versailles made a big mistake when redrawing the map of Europe, dividing it according to ethnicity and religion instead of considering economic factors. The answer to problems such as religious conflict in India seems to lie in strengthening the local economy, and should not be solved in a dogmatic and arbitrary way, but this answer goes against the entire trend of modern politics. From the current situation, the partition of India seems to be regarded as the only way to escape, but in fact, its impact will divide India into two hostile camps. The concept of partition obviously does not take into account economic needs, which is its weakness. Jinnah's advocacy of partition will not only deprive Hindus of their largest cities, but will also incorporate areas such as western Bengal and eastern Punjab, where Hindus are in the majority, into Muslim-ruled areas.

### American Republican Congressman Smith Says the Soviet Union Covets Alaska; It May Become a Second Pearl Harbor

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Congressman Smith declared in the House of Representatives today, "The Soviet Union is now coveting Alaska. If we are not careful, it may become a second Pearl Harbor." Smith asked American military experts to "formulate a defense plan for Alaska." It is said that there is sufficient evidence that the Soviet Union is intensifying its activities in the skies over Alaska. If we can act decisively at this moment, we can stop communism in the Western Hemisphere. Smith then proposed immediately recruiting military personnel to serve in Alaska, encouraging civilians to migrate to Alaska, developing natural resources, and developing land, sea, and air force bases.

### President Truman Signs American Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill

[This Newspaper's Report] San Francisco, 22nd Broadcasting: President Truman recently signed the $400 million aid to Greece and Turkey bill, which made the United States' foreign policy of supporting weak countries in resisting aggression effective. Truman called this move "an important step in establishing world peace" and at the same time proved that the United States will work hard to promote peaceful conditions, and that maintaining domestic order and economic independence in various countries is an important condition for peace.

### US House of Representatives Finally Approves Foreign Relief Bill

Maintains Original Amount of $350 Million

[United Press, Washington, 21st] The government's proposed $350 million foreign relief bill was finally passed by Congress today. When the Senate passed the bill, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg declared that President Truman is now considering sending several "highly experienced Red Cross personnel" to implement the plan. Red Cross Vice President Allen is slated to hold an important position. The House of Representatives also passed the bicameral conference committee's revised bill by a vote of 288 to 86, approving the full amount as requested by the President. Initially, some members of the House requested that the bill be returned to the conference committee to maintain the original House proposal, reducing it to $200 million, but this was rejected by a vote of 170 to 205. The final revised version of the foreign relief bill stipulates that the recipients are China, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Austria, Poland, and the Free Territory of Trieste, and that at least $15 million should be allocated to the United Nations' emergency relief fund. Republican Congressman Judd declared in response to questioning that if any country uses the aid to maintain its military beyond a fixed quota, the President may order the suspension of relief. This bill is completely different in nature from the $400 million aid package to Greece and Turkey to prevent communism.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Congress today passed President Truman's $350 million foreign relief bill and has sent it to the White House for the President's signature. A joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives has already approved the use of this relief fund to provide emergency aid to Austria, Greece, Italy, Hungary, Poland, China, and Trieste, where famine prevails. The legislative measures passed are as follows: (1) Approval of an allocation of $75 million to immediately begin relief work. (2) Allocation of $15 million to $40 million to the United Nations to be used as a European children's relief fund. (3) Assurance that these relief funds will not be used for political purposes and that their distribution will be monitored by a US delegation.

### Deteriorating Relations Between Greece and Yugoslavia

[United Press, Athens, 21st] The Greek government issued a statement today implying that relations with Yugoslavia are on the verge of breaking down.

### Middle Eastern Countries Organize "Anti-Communist Alliance"

[United Press, Baghdad, 22nd] The Jordanian envoy to Iraq, Arafani, stated today that King Abdullah of Jordan intends to organize a "anti-communist alliance" of Middle Eastern countries. Jordan will sign the Treaty of Saadabad initiated by Turkey as a preliminary step to expanding it into an alliance of Middle Eastern countries. The current signatories of the treaty are Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. This is to seek worldwide peace and prosperity.

### Stassen Advocates US Adopting a Three-Year Plan

To seek worldwide peace and prosperity

[Associated Press, Jefferson City, 21st] Republican presidential candidate Stassen called on the United States on the 21st to adopt a three-year plan and allocate 10% of its food and goods to promote world peace, prosperity, and freedom. This was Stassen's first major foreign policy speech since returning from his travels in Europe. Speaking to 35,000 people at a United Celebration, he said that the United States should no longer make donations, but should manage the funds, excluding military armaments, and hoped that the government would not interfere with economic freedom when implementing this plan. He opposes Wallace's proposed policies. All matters should be discussed with the United Nations Social and Economic Council, but we should manage this plan ourselves, he said.

### US State Department Carefully Considering Large-Scale Foreign Aid; Treasury Secretary Snyder Reveals at Press Conference

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] Treasury Secretary Snyder revealed at a press conference today that the State Department is conducting a large-scale review of the world economic situation to consider possible foreign aid plans, and that US experts will seek opinions from foreign governments. Experts from the Treasury Department, the National Advisory Council (a committee composed of the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of Commerce to handle foreign aid plans), will jointly study this plan with Secretary of State Marshall's expert committee. Marshall stated yesterday that he would not request congressional approval for new foreign aid packages until the study is completed. Snyder also said today that the US government has not received a new loan request from the UK. He declined to comment on the New York "Journal of Commerce" editorial, which stated that "Britain will inevitably request another loan from the United States by the end of next year in order to complete its reconstruction plan."

### Acheson Calls for Continued Aid to War-Torn Countries

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] Undersecretary of State Acheson (who has now resigned) delivered a speech last night for "International Trade Week," arguing that the United States should continue to provide aid to war-torn countries in 1948 and 1949, whether in the form of emergency loans or gifts, as this is the only way to break political extremism. Secretary of State Marshall attaches great importance to this issue, he said. Regarding this matter, according to informed sources, Secretary Marshall's previous statement that he would not submit new loan and aid requests to Congress only meant that he would not submit them before 1948.

### Organization Method of the Korean Provisional Government Still a Topic of Discussion for the US-Soviet Commission; Kim Gu, Syngman Rhee, and Others Hold Consistent Views

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 22nd] The US-Soviet Joint Commission, which solemnly opened yesterday in Seoul, began its formal meetings today. The meeting was still held at Deoksu Palace, but public attendance was strictly prohibited during the meetings. The main focus of discussion remains the issue of whether the right-wing should participate in the provisional government. Today, Kim Gu, Syngman Rhee, Jo Wan-gu, Jo So-ang, and Kim Seong-soo gathered at the Legislative Assembly to discuss the matter. According to them, their attitudes are now completely consistent, but they have not announced whether they will participate. In addition, the Democratic and National Front parties have been formally notified by Heo Heon (one of the leaders of the People's Party) that they are preparing to participate in the commission.

[United Press, Seoul, 22nd] Official sources say that the US-Soviet Joint Commission made significant progress in its secret meeting today to discuss the unified provisional government of Korea. According to US chief delegate Brown, "We have discussed all points on the agenda." Brown declined to specify the content of the agenda, saying that a joint statement will be issued tomorrow.

Kim Gu and Syngman Rhee Issue Joint Communiqué

[Associated Press, Seoul, 22nd] Syngman Rhee and Kim Gu issued a joint communiqué to the press, hoping that the US-Soviet Joint Commission will "quickly achieve its declared goals, abolish the 38th parallel dividing line, and establish an independent democratic government." Rhee and Kim's communiqué stated that whether they participate in the discussions of the Joint Commission will be decided by individual leaders and groups, and continued: "We cannot blindly follow the basic principles of the Joint Commission unless two major points can be satisfactorily clarified: the so-called trusteeship and independent government are contradictory. Therefore, the word 'trusteeship' in the Moscow resolution must be revoked or given a clear definition and announced so as to clear the path for establishing an independent government."

US Representative Advocates Expanding Freedom of the Press

[Associated Press, Seoul, 22nd] The US representative to the Joint Commission wants to propose a motion during the commission's meeting to consider how to prioritize granting the press broad freedom.

Some also believe that the three leaders will discuss the issue of trilateral economic cooperation.

### Difficulties Abound in United Cabinet; Japanese Political Situation Becomes Increasingly Chaotic; Komakichi Matsuoka Elected Speaker of the House of Representatives

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Although the compromise proposal put forward by the Democratic Party was established on the 22nd, the Liberal Party has become very isolated emotionally due to the defection of members of the Democratic Party's Laqi faction and the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. Even if the previous agreement is restored and the four-party coalition cabinet with the Socialist Party as Prime Minister is reconfirmed, the possibility of new difficulties arising regarding the allocation of cabinet ministers, ratios, and other issues is still very high. Therefore, in addition to the opposition between the Socialist and Liberal parties, the opposition between the Liberal and Democratic parties has also become apparent, and the political situation has become more chaotic.

Liberal Party Suffers Crushing Defeat in House of Representatives Election

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The House of Representatives met at 10:00 PM on the 21st to elect the Speaker and Deputy Speaker. The Socialist and Democratic parties jointly nominated Komakichi Matsuoka (Socialist Party) as the Speaker candidate and Man'itsu Tanaka (Democratic Party) as the Deputy Speaker candidate. The Liberal Party nominated Takeshi Yamaji and Michihiro Oishi as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker candidates. As a result of the vote, Matsuoka was elected Speaker and Tanaka was elected Deputy Speaker. Thus, under the common front of the Socialist and Democratic parties, the Liberal Party lost both the Speaker and Deputy Speaker positions. Matsuoka is an advisor to the Socialist Party, 60 years old, a former steel worker from Hokkaido, and participated in the general strikes of 1919 and 1927. In 1929, he represented Japan at the Geneva International Labour Conference.

Regarding the future course of the situation, the Liberal Party's attitude will remain reserved.

### MacArthur Considering Using Japanese Gold Reserves to Continue Funding Japan's Industrial Recovery; Japanese Export Trade Sees Dramatic Increase

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Officials in the Army Department responsible for Japan's international trade affairs announced today that MacArthur is considering using Japan's $1.3 billion gold reserves to continue funding Japan's industrial recovery. This fund can be used for self-liquidating enterprises, such as importing raw materials and paying for the advances with manufactured goods. MacArthur has the right to use these reserves. This plan is currently under consideration here and is likely to be completed in the short term. It is generally known that Army Department officials are raising funds to allow for broader Japanese imports, such as cotton. Negotiations on this funding are underway with the Export-Import Bank in Washington. The Export-Import Bank is also considering establishing a company with the same goal.

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Japan's first postwar batch of cultured pearls and porcelain tableware and tea sets were loaded onto three transport ships today, bound for the United States, including 13,000 strings of pearls, 5,500 sets of tableware, 15,000 sets of tea sets, as well as raw silk, scrap lead, zinc plates, fish liver oil, fur, mats, axes, tea, parasols, and baskets.

It is reported that the State Department believes that: (1) US trading companies are established to promote international trade. (2) This arrangement is the first step in direct trade between US merchants and Japanese manufacturers. Therefore, the prohibition is still under consideration.

### Another Yalta Secret Agreement: Britain and the Soviet Union Had Established Repatriation Agreement

[Reuters, London, 21st] Authoritative sources said: British authorities forcibly repatriated approximately 180 Soviet citizens residing in the Rimini concentration camp in Italy on May 8th and 9th, in accordance with another secret agreement in the Yalta Agreement. When British Foreign Secretary Mayhew explained in the House of Commons today the forced repatriation of these refugees, he stated that these people were Soviet citizens who had to be repatriated according to the Yalta Agreement. However, neither the Yalta Agreement, the Yalta Annex published last month, nor the secret agreement related to China published in February 1946 contained provisions regarding the repatriation of refugees. This proves that in addition to the secret agreements previously published, there are still secret agreements on the repatriation of refugees in the Yalta Agreement. A Foreign Office spokesperson explained tonight that in addition to the three agreements established at the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Britain and the Soviet Union also established a bilateral refugee agreement. Its content, except for a part leaked through semi-official channels, has not been published to date. According to the original provisions of the agreement, the UK is responsible for repatriating Soviet citizens in areas within the pre-war borders of the Soviet Union liberated by the British army to the Soviet Union. However, the question of whether Soviet citizens who did not wish to return to the Soviet Union could be forcibly repatriated was not discussed at the time. Later, when the fact that Soviet citizens did not wish to be repatriated to the Soviet Union occurred, the British government adopted the principles of repatriation listed in the American Wickersham-Clark directive. The directive was communicated to Foreign Minister Molotov by the former US Secretary of State at the Moscow Conference in December 1945. According to the directive, the definition of repatriated personnel is as follows: The UK is responsible for repatriating Soviet citizens who were within the borders of the Soviet Union on September 1, 1939, and who also had one of the following situations: (1) Those who were arrested wearing German uniforms; (2) Those who were in the Soviet army on June 22, 1941 (the day the Soviet Union entered the war) and had not been discharged; (3) Those who the Soviet authorities can prove assisted the enemy. The British Foreign Office spokesperson also stated that all Soviet citizens who were forcibly repatriated from Italy to the Soviet Union this time had been carefully investigated beforehand, and there were no suspicious cases among them.

### Hess's Cunning Acquisition of Aircraft for Flight to Britain Truth Revealed

[Reuters, Nuremberg, 21st] German aircraft design expert Messerschmitt, who is currently being held in Nuremberg to testify at the trial, recently disclosed the circumstances under which former Nazi Deputy Führer Hess fraudulently obtained an aircraft from him in 1941 to travel to Britain. According to him, in late autumn of 1940, Hess suddenly came to Augsburg and said that he intended to test Messerschmitt's new fighter jet. Messerschmitt refused because of Hess's important position and the significant consequences if something were to happen. However, Hess insisted and said that he was requesting it in his capacity as Deputy Führer and leader of the German youth, and that his request must be granted. In the end, Messerschmitt complied and provided him with an ME-110 aircraft for test flights. Hess's flying skills were indeed excellent. He flew the aircraft from the Augsburg airport, making 20 test flights. However, after each flight, he would criticize the aircraft's shortcomings and order Messerschmitt to find ways to improve it. His intention was to have an ideal aircraft for flying to Britain. After many test flights, Messerschmitt finally designed a perfect aircraft for him. In one conversation, Hess also inquired about how to destroy the aircraft if it was forced to land in enemy territory, and Messerschmitt naturally told him everything he knew. It was not until Hess landed in Scotland on the night of May 10, 1941, that Messerschmitt realized that Hess had already intended to fly to Britain during the test flights.

### Philippine President's Plane Missing; US Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Search; Roxas Orders Thorough Investigation

[United Press, Manila, 22nd] Philippine President Roxas's private plane, the "Lili Marlene," has not reached its destination four days after flying from Buac Airport here to Payagulong last Sunday. It is reported to have gone missing north of Tagum, Davao, Mindanao. About twenty US Army and Navy rescue aircraft were dispatched today to conduct a large-scale search. Philippine Airlines commercial aircraft searched all day yesterday. The plane was carrying at least twelve diplomats and government officials and eight crew members. Roxas has ordered a recount of the number of people on board. The aircraft is a C-53 giant aircraft, originally owned by Indian Governor Mountbatten, and later sold to Roxas. It was originally intended to fly to Paris to transport Vice President Quirino and his entourage back to the country. At the same time, in New York, Quirino expressed his regret for the disappearance of the aircraft. Quirino was originally scheduled to fly to London on the 27th to establish the Philippine Embassy there, but has now changed his plans to await President Roxas's orders.

[United Press, Manila, 22nd] A pilot of Philippine Airlines reported today that he had discovered the wreckage of an aircraft on a mountainside 8,700 feet high, east of Tangsalan in central Mindanao, which may be the missing aircraft of President Roxas. The fuselage was burned, and there were no signs of anyone nearby. This information is still awaiting confirmation. At the same time, the US 13th Air Force has dispatched a second rescue team to search according to the indicated clues.

### Major Developments Soon in British Domestic Political Situation; Internal Split in Labour Party May Be Avoided

[Associated Press, London, 21st] Two key members of the British Labour government, Foreign Secretary Bevin and Lord President of the Council Morrison, have returned here after being away from London for several weeks, respectively from Moscow and Monte Carlo. Therefore, it is expected that there will soon be major developments in the domestic political situation. Morrison's influence within the Labour Party may now be stronger than in the past. During his absence from London, the Labour Party experienced internal divisions and unrest, so many believe that if Morrison can lead the House of Commons and manage the Labour Party organization, he will be able to avoid it. Conversely, although Bevin achieved little in Moscow and is unlikely to gain the support of the people, his health is better than before, while Morrison's health has deteriorated. Therefore, it is expected that Bevin may be able to obtain a decisive voice in the future.

[United Press, London, 21st] Five district Labour Party officials resolved today to demand that the party congress condemn US aid to Greece and Turkey as an act that "threatens world peace" and urged an investigation into whether this violates the UN Charter. This resolution must pass the agenda committee and be seconded by a sufficient number of people before it can be submitted to the congress for discussion.

[Associated Press, London, 21st] The Labour Party will hold its annual congress in Margate, on the coast of Betts, next week. To prevent left-wingers from attacking it at that time, the Labour Party released a booklet today defending Bevin's foreign policy, stating: The Labour government does not intend to side with either the US or the Soviet Union, so as not to trigger a third world war. However, under no circumstances can Britain pursue a policy that leads to war with the US. Therefore, if the Soviet Union comes into conflict with the US, Britain cannot be its ally. The purpose of the Anglo-American understanding is to avoid war. As long as Britain plays a decisive role in US security and defense, the US cannot pursue a global aggression policy without British consent.

### US Army Magazine Advocates Moving Industries Underground

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] The "Armor Cavalry" magazine published an article on the 21st by Army Department intelligence expert Classmann, strongly advocating for immediate preparations to move strategic US industries underground to prevent atomic war. Although the magazine is not an official US Army Department magazine, it often represents the trends of Army thought. The Army Air Corps recently revealed the results of its research, stating that Japan achieved significant success by moving its aircraft manufacturing industry underground during the war, beyond the range of US bombing. Most of the underground factories were in the mountains.

### Soviet Army Chief of Staff Temporarily Declines Invitation to Visit Britain

### Our Country Sends Representatives to International Telecommunications Conference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The International Telecommunications Conference officially opened in New York on the 15th of this month. Our delegation consists of eight representatives, seven of whom departed for the United States at the beginning of the month. The remaining representative, Zhu Qiqing, also departed from Shanghai by plane this morning. According to information from the Directorate General of Telecommunications: The allocation of radio frequencies in our country is extremely disorganized. Specialized radio stations, military radio stations, and privately established radio stations across various regions either fail to follow legal registration procedures and freely adopt frequencies, or they possess inferior equipment and emit unstable frequencies, frequently causing domestic and international communication interference. International interference, in particular, often leads to inquiries and reproaches from foreign countries, which seriously damages our nation's reputation. Our delegation attending this conference feels greatly troubled by these criticisms. It is deeply hoped that all specialized, military, and private radio stations in our country can follow legal procedures, register with the Ministry of Communications, use designated frequencies, and inspect their equipment to reduce domestic and international radio communication interference, thereby enhancing our country's international reputation.

### Instigators of Strikes and Class Boycotts Will Be Prosecuted According to Martial Law; Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan Agree on Four Measures; Hoping Youth Will Use Reason to Solve Problems

[Report from this newspaper] Due to the recent surge of student unrest in this city, which has greatly impacted public security, Mayor Wu, after consulting with Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu yesterday, announced the following four measures based on existing national laws:

(1) Anyone who instigates strikes or class boycotts, regardless of their identity, may be reported to the relevant sub-bureau or the Garrison Headquarters by factory owners, shopkeepers, workers, or merchants and prosecuted according to Article 9 of martial law.

(2) Students who do not belong to a particular school and go to various schools to promote propaganda or deliver speeches may be refused entry by the school authorities. Those who refuse to comply may be reported to the relevant sub-bureau and prosecuted for obstructing public duties and disturbing public order.

(3) Those who occupy school property and prevent the school from using it will be ordered to vacate by the school authorities. Those who refuse to vacate may be reported by the school authorities to the relevant sub-bureau and prosecuted for obstructing public duties and trespassing.

(4) Students who voluntarily wish to attend classes may apply to the school authorities, who will then request protection from the relevant sub-bureau. Those who prevent the aforementioned students from resuming classes may be reported by the school authorities or students to the relevant sub-bureau and prosecuted for obstructing freedom.

### Mayor Analyzes the Inside Story of the Student Unrest

Mayor Wu stated when receiving reporters at 5 PM last night: The unanimous desire of Shanghai citizens at present is for stable order. The surge of student unrest has caused significant impact on society, which is regrettable. I have always been extremely protective of young students. However, after analyzing the content of the recent student unrest in this city, I have reached the following conclusions: (1) Recently, schools in this city have initiated class boycotts due to different issues. Just when efforts are being made to seek solutions through reasonable channels, new incidents occur, making it impossible for the municipal government to gradually resolve the issues according to the original plan. (2) The actions of the students in various schools were originally innocent and commendable, but the actions of a few students have gone beyond the bounds of the law. For example, students of Jinan University surrounded the residence of the president, causing the president's wife to be startled and jump out of the window, falling and getting injured; students of Datong University went to the president's residence to post slogans and overturn furniture; students of Jiaotong University took the liberty of starting a train, etc., all of which are violations of the law.

A Few Individuals Misuse Names

(3) The same phenomenon has occurred in student unrest across the country, which is that a few people misuse the names of the masses. For example, the total number of students at Jiaotong University is 3,000, but only 1,100 people went to the station that day to prepare to petition in Beijing (this was the statistic obtained when voting in the train the next morning). It is evident that the majority of 1,900 students opposed going to Beijing, but a few individuals arbitrarily acted in the name of all the students, which is completely unreasonable. (4) Based on the points listed above, it is clear that someone is attempting to use students as tools for causing chaos, which is very obvious. Recently, people have been forcibly going to various schools to give public speeches, attempting to incite class boycotts, market strikes, and labor strikes in other schools, which has already exceeded the students' own demands.

Mayor Wu further emphasized that the prayer of the city's four million citizens is for stability. If market and labor strikes were to materialize, the losses to the citizens would be unimaginable. Under these circumstances, the municipal government had no choice but to discuss and agree on the aforementioned measures with the Garrison Headquarters for strict implementation. These measures were originally formulated based on national laws. Anyone who opposes them is undemocratic, fails to respect the freedom of others, and clearly violates laws and discipline.

Mayor Expresses Four Wishes

Mayor Wu concluded by expressing four wishes: (1) For students - hoping that they can use reason to solve problems. Most students are pure and lovely and should have a law-abiding spirit, serving as role models for citizens and pioneers of true democracy. (2) For parents - parents should bear a heavy responsibility for the cultivation of youth. They should each advise their children to abide by the law and pay attention to all their children's actions on a daily basis. (3) For society - good people are generally afraid of trouble, but the more they are afraid of trouble, the more incidents occur. Therefore, it is hoped that people in society can not be afraid of trouble, rigorously report those who commit crimes, and pledge to be the government's strong support. (4) For ambitious individuals - youth are the future masters of the nation and the nation's most precious asset. Do not use youth as tools for causing chaos.

### The Communist Party Plans to Incite Middle and Elementary School Strikes; Military and Police Authorities Are Taking Strict Precautions

[Report from this newspaper] The Communist Party and its peripheral elements have recently planned to once again use students, preparing to take action starting today. At the same time, they are planning to incite middle and elementary school students throughout the city to participate, in order to further expand the incident and forcibly make students from different schools join strike marches. The authorities in this city have made all necessary preparations for this matter. In case of any disturbance, it is said that the military and police authorities are determined to protect the millions of citizens' shops and hope that the industrial and commercial sectors will not be fooled and create unnecessary panic.

It is also learned that the municipal authorities, in view of the fact that many of the students in this student unrest were being manipulated, the mayor will convene the parents of the students today to give them instructions, hoping that they can restrain their children, focus on their studies, and not be used by malicious people, leading to unnecessary sacrifices. If similar situations occur in the future and anyone willingly steps into the legal trap, the military and police authorities will arrest them all on the charge of disturbing public order without leniency.

### Student Brawl Case to Be Investigated Again Tomorrow Morning

[Report from this newspaper] As a minor episode in the midst of student unrest, the incident of students from Shanghai Law College beating each other has been transferred by the police bureau to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on charges of assault. After a brief interrogation by Prosecutor Li Geshun, they were released on bail by the authorities of the Law College. The District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled to summon the victims and suspects again for investigation at 9:00 AM tomorrow.

### Killed Aunt The Murderer Only Feigns Insanity Verified As Mentally Normal Cai Gongda Is Indicted

[Report from this newspaper] Cai Gongda, the owner of a tailor shop at 1181 Beijing West Road, was investigated several times by District Prosecutor Shen Zushou for the case of killing his cousin Cai Genyu. During questioning, Cai often gave irrelevant answers, seemingly suffering from a mental illness. According to his confession: "The reason for the killing was that Cai Genyu provoked the feelings between me and my wife, causing the relationship between me and my wife to break down. One day, I took cod liver oil pills and felt a strange taste in them. I suspected that Cai Genyu had put poison in them to harm me, which aroused my intention to kill." After Prosecutor Shen ordered a forensic examination, it was proven that he was mentally normal and purely feigning insanity. Therefore, he was indicted on the charge of murder under Article 271, Section 1 of the Criminal Code.

### Councilors Suggest Implementing Grain Distribution Based on Population

Municipal Councilors Xian Baoyu and others, in view of the recent rice surge in this city and other places, although the municipal government has organized fair-priced distribution through the Social Affairs Bureau, the management is still inadequate, unscrupulous rice merchants are engaging in malpractice, and disputes arise from time to time.

### Woolen Thread Embroidered MacArthur's Giant Portrait Representatives of Chinese Newspapers Jointly Present Souvenir

[Report from this newspaper] Representatives of Chinese newspapers were invited by General MacArthur to visit Japan in late February of this year. During their stay in Japan, they received a warm welcome from General MacArthur. Therefore, after returning to China, they specially commissioned the Mei Yi Weaving Factory in this city to produce a giant portrait of MacArthur embroidered with woolen thread, which was jointly presented by the representatives to MacArthur as a memento and to express their gratitude. The giant portrait will be specially transported to Japan by Qian Mingnian, staff officer and paratrooper major of the Chinese Delegation to Japan, and will depart for Japan soon.

The portrait is 48 inches high and 36 inches wide. It was designed by Shi Jinhu, the owner of Mei Yi Weaving Factory, and embroidered by Ms. Liu Peizhen and other female workers. The whole work is matched with dozens of colors of woolen thread, which is bright and eye-catching. The embroidery took more than a month to complete, and consumed as much as ten pounds of woolen thread, making the project very large.

This beautiful and novel handicraft is the result of Shi's six or seven years of research before it took shape. The products are mostly chair cushions. Before the Pearl Harbor incident, it was shipped to foreign countries and was praised by people from all over the world, who ordered them one after another. The images of Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill, Lincoln, Washington, and President Truman were embroidered one after another. The portraits of Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang Kai-shek, which are currently hanging in the National Assembly Hall of the capital and the Central Party Headquarters, are also made by Shi and Ms. Liu. Regarding the embroidery process, Shi first wrote the patterns and portraits on fine grid paper with watercolor paints, and then the female workers embroidered them on fine grid canvas according to the patterns, pressing each grid to embroider, without error, because missing a grid or embroidering the wrong grid can easily lead to distortion. When embroidering the portrait, the eyes, nose, and mouth must be embroidered first, and after the face is completed, the other parts are embroidered.

Mei Yi Weaving Factory is located at 457 Maoming South Road (Avenue Petain), and the retail department is located at 911 Shaanxi South Road (Avenue d'Alber). The factory currently has more than 20 female workers. During this summer season, the factory is engaged in embroidering shoe uppers. Each person can embroider about two or three pairs a day. After the embroidery is completed, it is handed over to the shoemaker to make them, and the selling price per pair is 38,000 yuan.

Shi and others deeply feel that embroidery portraits still need to be improved, so they are still studying carefully and plan to complete more wonderful masterpieces for overseas exhibitions. At the same time, he believes that his capital is limited and expansion is not easy, so he hopes that people from all walks of life will jointly establish a factory to show the new artistic handicraft of our country.

Attached is a portrait of MacArthur embroidered. Standing next to it, from left to right, are: Chen Xunnian, editor-in-chief of this newspaper and member of the visiting group to Japan; Qian Mingnian, staff officer and paratrooper major of the Chinese Delegation to Japan; Fan Houdong, reporter from the Central Photography Studio; Li Shuzeng, aide-de-camp to MacArthur; Cui Wanqiu, editor-in-chief of the China Times; Song Yuelun, reporter from the Southeast Daily.

### Shop Apprentice, Seeing Wealth, Has a Change of Heart, Kills Accountant for Key

[Report from this newspaper] Huang Yujia (pictured), also known as Zhimin, a 24-year-old apprentice from Chaozhou at Anchang Pawnshop at 120 Hubei Road, lost in solo transportation. At around 9:00 PM last night, taking advantage of the absence of shop employees, he saw wealth and had a change of heart. He held a kitchen knife and forced Pan Sanquan (30 years old, from Chaozhou), the shop's accountant, to hand over the key to the jewelry box. After Pan refused sternly, he raised his knife and slashed Pan's head. At that time, Pan resisted, causing his hands to be slashed six times.

### Looting Celluloid Accomplices Caught

### Two Packets of Heroin and a Gun Husband Escapes Wife Arrested

### Major Drug Trafficking Case via Air Transport: Opium Weighed Publicly

Weight Reached 703 Taels and 6 Mace

[Report from our Newspaper] In the major drug trafficking case via air transport recently cracked by the Police Bureau's Detective Section, the two large porcelain jars of opium seized were unsealed and weighed publicly yesterday by personnel dispatched by the bureau in conjunction with relevant agencies. The total weight was 703 taels and 6 mace, worth approximately 350 million legal tender. The opium is now temporarily held in the custody of the Narcotics Control Section.

### Temple Fair Prohibited: Buddha's Birthday Quiet

[Report from our Newspaper] The twenty-seventh of this month is the lunar calendar's Buddha's Birthday. Jing'an Temple usually holds a temple fair, but due to the current unstable situation, the police bureau fears that gangsters may take the opportunity to cause trouble, so they have issued an order to prohibit it.

### Scalper Ring Leader: Intention to Retaliate After Arrest, Falsely Accuses Travel Agency Employee

The Railway Bureau Police Department recently cracked a scalper ring led by Zhang Acai, who specialized in selling black market train tickets. According to his confession, in addition to his gang members obtaining tickets by queuing at the China Travel Service's two branch offices and train stations, it also involved a Mr. Wu, an employee of the China Travel Service, supplying them. Because scalping continues, and travelers in Shanghai suffer from it, the reporter specifically visited the Railway Police Department and the person in charge of the China Travel Service to understand the measures taken by various ticket selling agencies to crack down on scalping. It is said that the company has been established for more than 20 years and has always taken serving travelers as its duty. It has put the most effort into cracking down on scalpers. They regularly open the doors at 9:00 every morning to sell tickets in an orderly queue. When scalpers (who come to buy tickets every day) try to squeeze into the queue, Mr. Wu, who is in charge of ticketing at the company, identifies them and pulls them out, not allowing them to enter. At the same time, military police maintain order and, when evidence is found, hand them over to the military police for strict handling. Therefore, scalpers hate Mr. Wu the most, and have threatened him. This time, after the scalper ring leader Zhang Acai was arrested, he accused Mr. Wu of supplying black market tickets in order to retaliate and vent his anger. According to Zhang Acai's confession, he once handed over 4 million yuan in ticket money to Mr. Wu of the China Travel Service that day. It is found that the company sells only a small number of tickets each day, and the first-class reserved seat tickets to the farthest Nanjing station are only 30,000 yuan each. If 4 million yuan were used to buy black market tickets, it would account for almost half of the company's ticket sales. However, there are bound to be three or four thousand people who purchase tickets from passengers every day, so it is absolutely impossible in reality. However, if a small number of black market tickets are sold by the company, they are squeezed and purchased by new scalpers, which the company is really unable to prevent. It hopes that the press will visit to clarify the truth and that all sectors of society will assist. According to the Police Department, the five black market tickets seized from Zhang Acai the other day, with numbers 2236, 2241, 6186, 6169, and second-class Shanghai to Wuxi train tickets, were not sold by the China Travel Service.

### Real Estate Association Hopes for Reasonable Rent Increases

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Real Estate Association hosted the press at the New Licha Restaurant yesterday afternoon, attended by forty or fifty people. The president of the association, Ma Shaoquan, reported on the association's difficult situation. The general idea was that the current rent stagnation at 140 times is too unreasonable, leading to an increasingly serious housing shortage in the city and creating the strange phenomenon of second landlords earning huge transfer fees. In the future, it is requested that all sectors of society sympathize with increasing rents. The hope is not great.

Now, a small number of students are holding the majority of students hostage, preventing them from attending classes. We really can't stand it anymore. We should stand up and speak out, organize a joint association of student parents, guide students, advocate justice, and stabilize society. Democracy is definitely not about pandering to the public. We hope that the press truly cares for young people and does not add fuel to the fire, sending young people into the abyss of destruction!"

### The Beiping Education Association Declares Opposition: Tsinghua Professors Sympathize with the Class Boycott

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] The Beiping City Education Association recently issued a statement on the matter of Tsinghua University professors sympathizing with the student class boycott, expressing: "Recently, we read in the newspaper that more than 80 Tsinghua professors signed a statement sympathizing with the student class boycott. This association is extremely surprised. The Communist Party deceives young people, using them as tools of struggle, disregarding the loss of young people's studies, and only caring about the party's own interests. This is a fact that everyone knows. Furthermore, university students receive public funds, which is a special favor from the state. At present, most elementary school teachers are working on an empty stomach, but they all take the difficulties of the country to heart, because they deeply know that the current difficulties are due to the Communist Party's rebellion. During the government's suppression of the rebellion, only patience and determination can save the country and the nation. University professors should be scholars and great Confucian scholars, and their righteousness should always be a model for the literati. Now, they actually sympathize with the student class boycott, which is a deep concern for our education community. We dare to express our strong opposition to the signatures of the professors of Tsinghua University. If the rumors are untrue, then it is the fortune of our education community."

### School Presidents of Colleges and Above in This City Express Their Opinions on the Student Movement: Hoping Students Will Resume Classes Quickly and Restore Order

[Central News Agency, This City] The presidents of national and private colleges and universities in Shanghai held a meeting yesterday afternoon and expressed the following opinions on the current student movement: Recently, students from colleges and universities in this city have launched a large-scale class boycott movement. In terms of its motives and proposals, there is no lack of sympathy. However, the actions and attitudes they have taken are inevitably biased. In order to avoid the expansion of the situation and to find a solution so that schools can restore a harmonious and solemn atmosphere and society can maintain a stable and normal order, this association makes the following proposals: (1) One of the reasons why young people cannot study with peace of mind is that the country has not yet achieved stability. Since the government has repeatedly stated that it has never closed the door to peace, it is deeply hoped that the CCP will immediately lay down its arms and negotiate sincerely, so that the people's suffering will not be further deepened, social order can be restored, and then education can progress in an orderly manner. (2) Increasing education funding, improving teacher salaries, and student meals are consistent demands of the education community. However, using the means of a class boycott not only loses the original intention of maintaining education but also leads to more disputes. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that classes will be resumed quickly and order restored. This association is willing to do its best to promote the gradual realization of reasonable demands from young people within the scope of the government's financial capacity. (3) Each school is an independent institution and should maintain the dignity of its academic institution. Students in the school should express their opinions through legal channels and should not be interfered with by students from other schools. Recently, students from School A have formed teams and rushed into School B, posting slogans and distributing leaflets. This association has to express its serious condemnation. (4) What students are fighting for today is the realization of democracy. Everyone should have the opportunity to fully express their own will or opinions. If the resolution is passed by a majority, the minority can willingly accept it. If a meeting is held without reaching the legal quorum, or actions are taken without the approval of the majority, or even during a meeting, a few people shout and do not allow participants to freely express their opinions, then disputes will arise and inevitably run counter to the true meaning of democracy. Furthermore, in recent years, there have often been organizations claiming to be united among students in various schools. It is often impossible to prove whether the representatives who participate are elected by all the students of each school and whether the tasks they undertake are entrusted by all the students. If one claims to be a representative without legal procedures and then takes advantage of the name to issue orders, it is even more inconsistent with the spirit of democracy. (5) School systems or regulations should be implemented by the school in accordance with education laws and regulations. Whether there is a need for changes should be decided by the education administrative authorities or the school, not by students' frivolous claims. The members of this association deeply apologize for not being able to make effective communication in advance of the rise of this storm. We hope that students from various schools can calmly seek solutions to problems without competing for emotions. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Student Union of Datong University convened a general assembly at the school at 9:00 AM yesterday, with over a thousand students in attendance. At that time, Mayor Wu was visiting the school for inspection, and the students immediately requested him to give a speech.

### National Martial Arts Included in National Games Championship: Beijing Martial Arts Circles Send Letter to National Games Organizing Committee Requesting

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing] Zhu Guoxiang, a teacher at National Central University in Nanjing, and over fifty members of the martial arts community, have sent a letter to the National Games Organizing Committee requesting that martial arts be included in the National Games as a championship event. The letter states: "Having read in the newspapers that the first preparatory meeting for the Seventh National Games has listed martial arts as a performance event but not as a championship, this decision seems inappropriate. Previous National Games have included martial arts as one of the championship events, including boxing, weapons, wrestling, archery, slingshot, shuttlecock kicking, and strength testing. Among these seven items, we believe that martial arts is the most meaningful and historical national sport in our country. At the previous Games, representatives from Mongolia were invited to perform wrestling, which attracted the attention of the general public. After careful consideration, we urge your committee to include martial arts as one of the official championships. The reasons are as follows: (1) Martial arts is a traditional sport in our country, and practitioners across the country are exceptionally widespread. Other countries strongly promote their own traditional sports. The fact that the current National Games only lists martial arts as a performance is clearly inconsistent with the central government's repeated pronouncements to promote martial arts. (2) Martial arts, like other sports, has its own competitive significance. It is not only a high-intensity exercise but also a life skill that can be applied. It should be actively promoted for its widespread use. (3) It is unfair that table tennis is included as an official championship event, while the traditional martial arts are only listed as a performance event."

### Local Martial Arts Community to Hold Symposium Today

The Seventh National Games will be held this Double Tenth Festival. The local martial arts community is holding a symposium at the Municipal Gymnasium conference room on Shaanxi South Road at 7:30 PM today to discuss whether to request the National Games to add martial arts championships and to promote and revive martial arts in the future. Martial arts masters Tong Zhongyi, Zhang Qidong, Tang Huang, Wang Yiqiao, Wang Huaiqi, and others will attend to discuss.

All municipal elementary school colleagues are welcome to attend.

### Reviewing Zheng Lun

Zheng Lun's fifth battle in Shanghai against Encas, this game was known to be worth watching. After several games, a definite understanding of Zheng Lun's advantages has been gained: stamina, speed, and shooting accuracy.

But the first two advantages against Encas were of no use, because Encas also had extraordinary stamina and speed. Zheng Lun was able to maintain its victory last night for one reason only, which was that its shooting skills surpassed Encas'.

Zheng Lun still has undeniable weaknesses: passing skills need improvement, and control of the ball under the basket lacks precision. Especially when attacking the enemy's basket, after a missed shot, the ball falls into Encas' hands. Tu Wenlong is the center of Zheng Lun's team. He is quick-witted, shoots accurately, and has a naturally gifted physique. The new player, Cheng Fei, is flexible and has a promising future.

I believe that Zheng Lun still has many shortcomings, which is a cause for optimism; strength and speed are innate, not advantages, while the basic techniques of basketball, Zheng Lun, except for shooting, has not yet reached the pure heat. I believe that with each game they play, they can "absorb" something new, making progress every day. (Changnian)

### Striving to Cooperate with Government Policies: Four Banks to Implement In-Kind Loans: Vice Chairman Zhang Attends Board Meeting for the First Time and Delivers Speech

[United Credit Information Service, Nanjing, 6:00 PM on the 22nd] The position of Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Four Banks has been assigned by the National Government to the current Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun. Mr. Zhang attended the 344th Board Meeting of the organization for the first time this morning. Those present included Directors Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, Weng Wenhao, Song Hanzhang, Qian Yongming, Chen Guofu, Zhao Jianhua, Li Shuming, Huo Saite, Chen Xing, Pang Songzhou, Tan Boyu, Secretary-General Xu Boyuan, Director Wu Rencang, Director Gu Chunfan, General Manager Shou Miancheng, and others. The meeting began at 9:00 AM. Mr. Zhang delivered a speech, stating that the main business of the Four Banks is to unite the strength of various banks and bureaus, to cooperate with the government's financial policies, and to assist in the development of production enterprises. The Four Banks have made many contributions during the war of resistance, and should continue to work hard to meet the needs of post-war reconstruction. Mr. Zhang also gave a comprehensive explanation of the current financial situation, hoping that loan business should focus on key areas and take the initiative to better fit the national policy. Subsequently, the meeting discussed the Secretariat's report on the past loan approval situation and future policies of the organization. The directors all expressed their opinions successively, discussing for about two hours. The scope of various loans approved by the organization over the years has not gone beyond the following four items:

(1) Those related to national economic construction;

(2) Those related to social people's livelihood;

(3) Those related to promoting foreign exchange earnings;

(4) Other matters that should be assisted to cooperate with national policies.

In the future, to assist the government in controlling materials and stabilizing prices, the organization will consider piloting in-kind loans and in-kind recovery methods, or using order methods, to supply funds to certain private industrial and mining enterprises. This active method will be submitted to the Loan and Agricultural Loan Subcommittee for separate research and then reviewed and approved.

In addition, the Jiangzhe District spring silkworm cocoon loan was previously approved for 120 billion yuan. Because the cocoon price has increased, the organization, in order to assist in completing this year's silk reeling plan, has approved an increase of 80 billion yuan to the above loan amount, for a total of 200 billion yuan.

### Unfavorable Swap Situation Leads to Abrupt Price Drop in Yongsha Shares

The Chinese stock market initially showed a slight upward trend yesterday, but due to an unfavorable swap situation, many parties sold at high prices, and new buyers did not follow. Rumors of unfavorable sentiment towards buyers remained strong. Near noon, Yongsha shares suddenly experienced a sharp decline, with the immediate delivery Yongsha shares suffering the most significant drop, causing the swap spread to widen further. Yongsha is scheduled to hold a board meeting on the 25th. There are increasing rumors in the market about capital increases, and some even speculate whether buying and selling will be temporarily suspended if Yongsha actually implements a capital increase. It is said that the Guangdong group strongly advocates stopping trading, but the exchange, for revenue considerations, is rumored not to accept it. This move has a significant impact on short squeezes, long squeezes, and the prospects of miscellaneous second-tier stocks.

The morning began with a weak market due to the unfavorable swap situation. However, the forward Yongsha shares disregarded everything, opening high at 7,500 yuan. After the opening, Nos. 213, 31, 169, 106, and 76 sold off, briefly pushing the forward Yongsha shares down to 7,370 yuan. Nos. 141, 205, 218, and 79 all entered the market, leading to a peculiar shortage on the trading floor and a rebound to 7,730 yuan. Nos. 61, 148, 105, 164, 224, and 152 all sold off, retreating to within 7,500 yuan. Nos. 223, 14, 143, 94, 148, 17, and 78 entered the market, while Nos. 35 and 61 bought spot Yongsha shares, pushing the price up to 7,800 yuan. No. 180, 224, and 78 sold off, bringing the price down to 7,650 yuan. Nos. 106 and 155 maintained strong buying interest, pushing the price up to 7,850 yuan. Nos. 153, 89, 32, 655, 83, and 12 sold off, and after 11:30 AM, the market gradually became unsustainable. Nos. 24, 223, and 36 also sold off, and by 11:50 AM, the price had fallen to 7,350 yuan. Nos. 155, 65, 232, 14, 218, and 36 entered the market at 7,600 yuan, but thereafter the situation worsened. Rumors favored buying, and Nos. 76, 197, 89, 153, 223, 160, and 235 all sold off, with scattered long positions selling off urgently. No. 83 even cut losses on immediate delivery Yongsha shares. In the afternoon, the forward Yongsha shares were pushed down to 7,050 yuan. No. 141 and others made slight purchases, and the afternoon closing price rose to 7,120 yuan. After the close, the market appeared hesitant, and Meiya and Yonggong shares had reportedly fallen to their limit. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yongsha, Xinguang, and Qinxing shares each fell by more than 50%, Jingfu, Xinhe, Xinhua, and Yonggong shares each fell by more than 10%, and Meiya shares fell to their limit. For forward delivery, there was only half a day of trading the previous day, so Yongsha shares fell slightly, Qinxing shares rose slightly, Xinhe, Xinguang, and Jingfu shares each fell by more than 50%, and Meiya and Yonggong shares each fell by 10%. For cold stocks, China France Goods rose to their limit, while China Textile, Tongyi, China Silk, Firewood, and Cement shares each fell by about 10%, Datong shares fell by 50%, and other stocks generally fell by about 50%. In the over-the-counter market, Zhabei shares rose by 10%, World shares fell by 10%, and other stocks experienced mixed price movements.

Yesterday, arbitrage transactions for spot and forward delivery shares saw a reduction in funds from the financial sector, but only Nos. 8 and 9 large long positions posted orders. Trading was not active. Yongsha shares opened at 450 yuan, fell to 400 yuan, then gradually rose to 560 yuan, and closed at 550 yuan. Meiya shares opened at 2,200 yuan, rose from 2,000 yuan to close at 2,500 yuan. Xinhe shares retreated from 280 yuan to 220 yuan, and closed at 260 yuan. Small-cap stocks ranged from 10 yuan to 13 yuan, and the combined interest rate ranged from 2 jiao 2 fen to 3 jiao 2 fen.

### Government Bonds Mediocre, Foreign Stocks Hesitant

Government bonds were mediocre and slightly weak yesterday. Unified Ding bonds were relatively stable, with only over 4 million in transactions. Unified Bing bonds opened at 14,500 yuan, fell to 13,800 yuan, and then stabilized. Rooms 550 and 360 had sales. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Jia and Yi bonds fell by 600 yuan, Bing bonds fell by 800 yuan, Unified Ding bonds remained flat, and Unified Wu bonds also fell by 300 yuan.

Foreign stocks were also hesitant yesterday. The price fluctuations of various stocks were minor. The Guangdong group absorbed small-cap stocks, while foreign firms focused on British Union. Securities firms remained willing to sell, so the process lacked progress. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yibier and Paper shares rose slightly, Huidfeng and Zhi remained flat, Yisha and Shipping shares each fell by about 50%, and other stocks generally fell slightly.

### Rayon Shouts High, Factory-Run Silk Goods Downstream

Yesterday, the rayon market saw the China Trust Bureau extending the deadline for silk weaving industry allocations to the end of the week, leading to a tight supply of chips in the market and a shift in sentiment. No. 120, Gaoshan Youguang, opened at 17 million yuan and closed up 100,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the asking price rose by another 100,000 yuan, eventually reaching 17.2 million yuan, up 300,000 yuan from the previous day. Dongyang and Jin Sanma, etc., also followed suit. Semi-gloss No. 75 was ignored. Yesterday's market still shouted the original plate from the previous day. The factory-run silk goods market yesterday faced a very thin appetite from the silk factories, creating an imbalance between supply and demand, and the asking price continued downstream. The transaction price for grade A was 20.7 million yuan, grade C opened at 20.2 million yuan, and grade E was 19.5 million yuan, all down 300,000 yuan from the previous day, with extremely low transaction volume. Dry silk was ignored, and the asking price did not fluctuate much.

Yesterday, the silk goods market was generally stable, except for price silk bedding and plaid crepe, which were slightly short. Meiya bedding was quoted at 8.6 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan from the previous day, with no transactions. Dacheng plaid Fengqu took the lead at 31,700 yuan, but due to the emergence of multiple parties, the asking price gradually decreased, and finally sold for 1,300 yuan. The next day, the asking price was 1,600 yuan, which was 700 yuan less than the previous day.

### Silk and Satin Transportation and Printing

[Reported by this newspaper] It is learned that approximately 20,000 pieces of export silk and satin produced by the Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company have been shipped in three batches and have now all been declared for import. It was previously rumored that India intended to ban the import of foreign silk after the end of June this year. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now instructing our ambassador to India to investigate this matter in detail. It is heard that the United States has also expressed disagreement with India's move. If the rumor is true, diplomatic channels will be used to seek a reasonable solution.

### Cotton Yarn Turns Firm

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market turned firm, mainly because there was a strong call to lift restrictions on the circulation of yarn and cloth. If it becomes possible to lift the restrictions, yarn prices are expected to rise, so sentiment has improved and there has been a slight replenishment in the market. 42-count blue [brand name] opened at 11.8 million yuan, then gradually rose, and finally reached 12.1 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count special double horse was 7.15 million yuan, up 250,000 yuan. Double horse yarn rose from 6.65 million yuan to 700,000 yuan at the close, also up 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Other yarns all rose by 50,000 yuan to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan from the previous day.

### Summer Cotton Cloth Shows Sales

In the cotton cloth market, due to rumors the previous day that there would be restrictions on mobility in North China, customers generally held a wait-and-see attitude, and purchases in this street were also sluggish. Therefore, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth retreated slightly to 288,009 yuan, and was still less accepted. Later, people in the industry believed that the news of restrictions in North China was untrue, and instead there were rumors of high sales, and sentiment in the market suddenly stabilized. This defense has purchased summer cloth, and as a result, various bridge bleached cloths have risen by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Longtou fine cloth rose by 2,000 yuan to 295,000 yuan, while jump [brand name] serge and Yuangong satin, etc., increased. Other Shilin cloths fell by about 10,000 yuan. Blue cloth fell by 10,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan, while coarse cloth, fine cloth, and palace cloth, etc., mostly saw declines.

### Soap and Candle Raw Materials Fall, Caustic Soda Plunges 600,000

Yesterday, the raw materials for soap and candles saw a drop due to the arrival of goods from Hong Kong and the dumping by foreign firms, causing the market price to steadily fall. Monthly brand caustic soda fell to 7 million yuan, a sharp drop of 600,000 yuan, and American goods also followed suit, falling to 6.9 million yuan. Caustic soda powder fell from 2,000 yuan per pound to 1,800 yuan, and Siding fell by 200,000 yuan to 3 million yuan. The prices of other coconut oil, vanilla rosin, and white wax, etc., remained stable.

### Xiangmao Distributes Goods

China Soap Company previously distributed MC and MO grades of yellow and white Xiangmao soap to fellow traders. The company stipulated that the deadline for payment was the 21st. Now, because each household of traders has to pay 820,000 yuan in cash for this time, the procedure for checking banknotes is quite slow, and quite a few traders have not yet paid. The company has now specially extended the payment deadline to tomorrow (Saturday) to clear payments and complete the procedures for receiving goods.

### Rice Arrivals Scarce, Market Continues to Rise, High-Quality White Japonica Rice Made a New Price of 340,000 Yuan Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Rice arrivals were scarce yesterday, totaling 6,384 shi. Rice merchants had good inventory and the market was active, and the market continued to rise, rising another 10,000 to 20,000 yuan from the previous day. High-quality white japonica rice was traded at 335,000 yuan in the southern market and made a new high price of 340,000 yuan in the northern market. A portion of the Siamese rice allocated by the Social Affairs Bureau to rice merchants who had already paid taxes was shipped out yesterday. Of this, 40% was broken rice, which is often mixed with good rice and sold separately in various districts during the day.

Also reported: Flour continued to fall in the mainland and was therefore sluggish, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bran was supplied by the factories as usual, with sales moving without stagnation, and prices were stable. Northeastern soybean cake continued to arrive, with rural sales slightly moving, and the market was stable. Yellow beans remained flat, green beans had few customers, and fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum continued to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and red beans had separate movements, rebounding by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were similar, sesame seeds from Tianjin and Zhuang had a market, and rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The new season of broad beans will arrive in Shanghai soon, and the market is trending softer. Northern corn dealers are still vigorously collecting corn, and it continues to soar by 15,000 to 16,000 yuan.

Various kinds of oil had arrivals, with idle digestion. Soybean oil fell sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, pure oil continued to fall by 20,000 yuan, and crude oil also fell by more than 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil fell by another 10,000 yuan.

### Peruvian Sugar Prices Negotiated, Set at 430,000 Yuan

A large amount of Peruvian sugar is stored in various warehouses in this city. To prevent it from flowing into the black market, the Sugar Association decided to follow the order of the Social Affairs Bureau to complete registration procedures and prepare a cost calculation table, which was submitted to yesterday's Price Review Committee Sugar Group meeting for discussion. The price was agreed to be 430,000 yuan per 100 pounds, and cash transactions were used as a standard. Those who can transfer warehouse receipts will be given a discount as usual. However, supply should be maximized and all of it should be sold to the market, and hoarding and speculation are strictly prohibited.

### Hardware Market Conditions

Yesterday, the hardware market was stagnant again. Western nails fell slightly, and actual sales were average. Various goods were unable to increase in price.

(C) Regarding the import of goods donated by overseas Chinese to schools, social organizations, and institutions in the Xiamen district, it was resolved that it should be handled in accordance with the decision of the 23rd meeting of this committee.

(2) The Guangzhou Import and Export Association proposed a draft plan for the import of raw materials for export products. It is heard that the above two cases have been submitted by Director Zhang to the National Economic Commission for approval.

### US Dollar Bond Fund to Be Deposited in New York Bank of China, Short-Term Treasury Bill Collateral Planned

[Reported by this newspaper] Mr. Li [name], Director of the Supervision Committee of the 36-Year US Dollar Bond Fund, recently discussed the issues of short-term treasury bills, US dollar public prices, fund, and collateral with reporters as follows:

(1) (Question) Has the short-term treasury bill fund collateral been determined, and what is the valuation situation? (Answer) The designation of this collateral was previously discussed at a meeting convened by the Ministry of Finance, following the order of the Executive Yuan, inviting representatives from the Economic Department Investment Committee, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Bureau, and the Bond Fund Supervision Committee. It was resolved to formulate a plan to designate eight units, including Fangjian, China Silk, China Tobacco, Aquatic Products, various companies, Defu Foreign Firm, Bayer Factory, enemy and puppet warehouses and docks, and enemy and puppet real estate, as well as the Economic Department's other business investment shares. The valuation has been completed, and the ministry will submit it to the government for designated announcement.

(2) (Question) Has the US dollar debt repayment fund been issued, and where is it stored? (Answer) According to the organizational regulations of the Supervision Committee, the financial institution where the US dollar bond fund is deposited should be designated by the Supervision Committee. Currently, the fact that this designation should not be restricted by the "Public Treasury Law" is being submitted to the government for approval. Once this point is approved, the Supervision Committee will formally designate the place of deposit. The Central Bank can then allocate the first installment of principal and interest to the Supervision Committee in full in accordance with the regulations. The place of deposit is likely to be the Bank of China in New York.

(3) (Question) When can the preferential interest short-term treasury bills be issued? (Answer) I went to Wuhan in the beginning of this month and only returned to Shanghai yesterday. Regarding the issuance of preferential interest short-term treasury bills, I have only seen the news and discussions in the newspapers. I have not heard anything else. As of now, it still seems to be a suggestion. This matter has a significant impact on the overall financial relationship. In my opinion, it needs to be carefully studied, weighing the advantages and disadvantages, and it should not be easily attempted.

### Cigarette Market Turns Promising

Yesterday, the cigarette market turned promising. Cigarettes from the Yizhong Company were selling very well, and fellow traders frequently requested additional supplies, leading to higher asking prices. The sales of Chinese cigarettes were average. The Morning Pass British Brand opened at 7.4 million, then gradually rose to a high price of 7.7 million yuan. Old Knife gradually rose from 6.65 million yuan to over 6.7 million yuan. Due to fellow traders from other cities selling off at high prices, the market slightly retreated.

At the midday close, British cigarettes stood at 7.5 million yuan, and Old Knife had supplies for sale at 6.68 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was a slight profit-taking release, causing British cigarettes to retreat by 200,000 yuan, resulting in a price of 7.3 million yuan, up 10,000 yuan from the previous day. Old Knife was 6.675 million yuan, up 45,000 yuan. Other Chinese cigarettes had mixed price movements.

[Also reported] Yesterday, the tip cigarette footing remained firm. Chariot sold for between 55,500 yuan and 6,000 yuan. 50-stick Three Cannon was even more promising, and it was heard that it was difficult to buy in even at a price of 32,000 yuan.

[Also reported] The asking price for the Beauty Brand cigarette was hovering around 40,000 yuan per carton before 9:00 AM.

At that time, there were many supplies for sale in the market, but buyers needed to pass the 40,000 yuan mark, and they seemed willing to enter the market at 37,000 to 8,000 yuan.

[Reported by this newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce and the Industry Association held a discussion with representatives from various industry associations in the city at the City Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of the first-term quota import of industrial raw materials. Thirty to forty representatives from various industries attended, chaired by Pan Shihao. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The details of the process are recorded below:

(A) Reporting Matters: Regarding the issue of industrial raw materials, the first discussion meeting was held on the 5th of this month, and five methods were resolved.

(B) Discussion Matters: (1) Regarding the certification of approved imported raw materials before the end of January, three methods have been decided and announced to the various associations for compliance. However, the Import and Export Management Committee is about to begin allocating the first-term quota for imported industrial raw materials. Please discuss and decide how the associations should comprehensively and carefully certify in the future to prevent abuses.

Resolution: From now on, for the raw materials required by various factories, if they have applied to the Import and Export Management Committee or signed a purchase contract with importers before January 30th of this year and have been approved for import, certification will be granted. However, when certifying, member manufacturers must first sell the certificate, provide documents, and pledge to abide by the following two items: (1) When the association handles the entire quota allocation in the future, the above amount will be deducted from its first-term allocation. (2) If the order quantity exceeds the production capacity for three months as specified, the excess quantity may be distributed by the association to all colleagues in the industry.

### Government Acquisition of Export Goods Is the Current Reasonable Method

[Reported by this newspaper] According to an export industry insider, due to the drastic fluctuations in commodity prices in various countries in the past and the large gap between domestic and international prices, the export industry has been at a standstill. Taking tung oil, a major export commodity, as an example, the domestic price is at least 50% higher than the international price. Therefore, it is a reasonable method for the government to authorize agencies to purchase export materials, unify foreign sales, and bear the losses from the national treasury at present.

### Business Federation Appoints Representatives to Undertake the Japanese Compensation Factory

[Reported by this newspaper] The National Business Federation's representatives to participate in the undertaking of the Japanese compensation factory, according to the previous proposal, are Wang Xiaolai (Shanghai), Fu Rulin (Shanghai), Jin Runxiang (Shanghai), Ge Jieshen (Shanghai), Wang [name] Zhai (Nanjing), Lu Xiaobo (Jiangsu), Zhu Huiqing (Zhejiang), and Sun Yuanfu (Anhui). The Industry and Commerce Counseling Office is scheduled to hold a meeting today to continue discussing the undertaking matters and hopes that the Industry Association and the Chamber of Commerce will submit the list of candidates from various places as soon as possible.

### Export through Hong Kong Declines

[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 22nd] The export of Fujian and Taiwan tea through Hong Kong is declining. Before the war, the countries that imported Chinese tea through Hong Kong, such as Siam, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, have weakened purchasing power after the war and mostly use cheaper local tea. Before the war, the quantity of Chinese tea transported to Vietnam through Hong Kong was about 100,000 pieces per year, but last year it was only 2,000 pieces. Recently, tea prices have fallen lower than last year. Ordinary packaged tea has fallen from more than 400 yuan to 110 yuan, Minbei Wuyi tea Dayan Narcissus has fallen from more than 2,000 yuan to 1,800 yuan, and Taiwan BOP black tea has fallen from 390 yuan to 130 yuan, but Anxi Tieguanyin prices are stable and still selling for 1,200 yuan.

### Ping Shui for Export Is Being Prepared

Yesterday, the foreign tea market was still sluggish because the asking prices from various places could not converge. According to industry insiders, the Ping Shui tea, which is welcomed in the Americas, is being prepared in the producing area this year. However, it is heard that the cost is quite expensive, requiring more than 1 million yuan per dan. At this price, it may be difficult to meet foreign tastes, so exports may not be optimistic. The market for various domestic teas is not stagnant, and the prices of various grades are stable. However, the 35-year Zhengzhou Hongqing is considered unique due to the relationship between the buyer and seller, and the market atmosphere is rapidly developing.

### Fluctuations in the Pound Exchange Rate

Official Price 4 Yuan, Market Price 2.5 Yuan

[French News Agency, London, 21st] Although British and American officials have denied the widespread rumor that the United States will provide new loans to the United Kingdom, the rumor is still rampant. Therefore, the exchange rate of the pound against the dollar has also fluctuated. The official exchange rate is four US dollars to one pound, but the market price of the pound on Wall Street is 2.5 yuan.

### Leather Falls

Leather prices have already peaked. In the past two days, due to tight credit and frequent high-level sales by cargo owners, actual sales have turned stagnant and transactions are few. Various goods have fallen rapidly.

### Discussion on the Mixed Use of Glucose Calcium and Vitamin C

— Wang Qizhang

Having read Mr. Song Guobin's review of this issue in the fourth issue of this journal, and Mr. Shen Songnian's doubts about the review in the tenth issue, both have scholarly origins and unique insights, which are enlightening. Confined by my own knowledge, I would like to offer my humble contribution based on my past experience. I hope that Mr. Song and Mr. Shen will provide further guidance if there is anything appropriate.

The complexity of chemical synthesis and decomposition in the human body is far beyond what modern scholarship can fully understand. The saying that the human body cannot be moved into a research laboratory is precisely a puzzle before us. The premise that this issue cannot be thoroughly resolved is due to this. The benefits of calcium therapy for tuberculosis and the lack of calcium in tuberculosis patients have been known for decades and still hold a strong position in academia. However, in application, it is mostly administered non-orally to avoid complex changes in the digestive system, hence the popularity of injection methods, especially intravenous injection, as the general goal. The first requirement of calcium therapy is that the calcium must be in a soluble liquid form, and the second is to minimize irritation and avoid hemolysis. In the past thirty years, various products for intravenous injection have been improved for various therapeutic purposes. According to my knowledge, the most commonly used are the following:

Calcium chloride Calcium chlorat

Calcium lactate Calc.lact

Calcium benzoate Calc.benzoce

Calcium iodide Calc.godat

Calcium bromide Calc.bromat

Calcium salicylate Calc.salicylie

Calcium gluconate Calc.gluconat

Calcium glucono-galacto-gluconate or calc lacto-bionate

And many other simple or mixed products, with the important goal of obtaining a clear and colorless solution. However, the calcium required in the body's lesions is mainly in insoluble form. It is well known that various acid radicals are added to make calcium soluble for easy entry into the bloodstream, facilitating transport and avoiding thrombosis, while the ultimate need is still for insoluble calcium blocks. This is nothing more than scientists making a show of knowledge.

In the past thirty years, I have chemically studied calcium blocks in tissues from corpses and occasionally coughed up by patients, confirming that the main component is calcium carbonate, with occasional traces of phosphorus, as a kind of calcium salt, and not the pure calcium commonly thought. The reason is very clear. Thus, it is known that regardless of the type of calcium preparation injected into the body, it undergoes several stages of acidification as it passes through various tissues, abandoning the original acid radical and combining with carbonic acid to form insoluble calcium carbonate blocks. This is beyond doubt. We only worry that it will not be acidified, will not undergo chemical reactions, and will preserve its original solubility, leaking out of the body. However, where and how (perhaps in the lesions) carbonation and other acid radical exchange occur in the body, and whether it is gradual or sudden, I, with my limited knowledge, dare not say.

Mr. Song's theory of acid prohibition can be examined in two sections. If limited to the stomach, i.e., oral administration, then gastric juice is inherently acidic. If a weak acid radical or a halogen group element such as iodine is used in the salt, due to affinity, it is very likely to turn into calcium chloride. However, calcium chloride is a soluble neutral salt. If it enters the intestine and encounters an alkaline environment without any change, it can still be absorbed and achieve the purpose of calcium therapy. It does not require alcohol, beer, vinegar, coffee, sandalwood lemon, oranges, apples, tomatoes, spinach, etc., which originally contain acid, or stimulate the secretion of gastric acid, to change the original structure of the calcium preparation. Secondly, the question of how injected calcium, not through the mouth, changes in the blood seems to be greatly related to the acidity of the blood. However, physiologically, the acidity of the blood has a normal range. If, due to some disease or abnormal metabolism, the acidity of the blood exceeds the normal range, we consider it acidosis, which is not a normal physiological phenomenon. Therefore, we have no experience with compounds of citric acid, acetic acid, or tartaric acid with calcium, and we have never heard of ascorbic acid calcium. Moreover, the fact that calcium gluconate and ascorbic acid do not undergo any chemical changes after mixing in the injection syringe proves that the affinity between glucose and calcium is definitely not weaker than that of ascorbic acid, which is very clear.

Secondly, the question of the human body's need for calcium often gives people the feeling of excess or deficiency. However, the calcium content in the blood should be within a certain limit, and the needs of each person vary depending on various circumstances. For example, rickets and lung patients, or pregnant women, often seem to lack calcium, while the elderly and those with diseases that damage blood vessels, such as syphilis, have concerns about excessive calcium. I recall that when I was in school, Professor Katase of the Department of Pathology conducted extensive research on the problem of calcium clumping in body tissues and published many reports and papers. Unfortunately, these documents were completely lost during the Anti-Japanese War, but I remember the main idea was that when a large amount of calcium was injected into the blood of children daily, after a certain period of time, the calcium content in the blood and the calcium blocks in the whole body were examined. As a result, no abnormalities were found, only the amount of calcium excreted in the urine increased. Then, the blood of rabbits whose blood vessels or part of the body tissue had been damaged was injected with calcium in the same way, and examined after a certain period of time. Except that the calcium content in the blood remained the same, calcium blocks could be found in the damaged parts of the blood vessels and tissues. Thus, it is known that the calcium content in the blood of the human body is often constant (the report mentioned a temporary increase in calcium content, but the reason was examined immediately after the injection of calcium). Even if a large amount of calcium circulates through healthy tissues, there will be no stagnation or clumping, and the unnecessary calcium will be excreted from the body. Only the damaged blood vessels and diseased tissues will have calcium attached. As for Mr. Song's opinion that syphilis, alcohol poisoning, and the elderly do not need much calcium, or even that calcium may induce other diseases, it is completely consistent with my humble opinion.

In my humble opinion, Mr. Song and Mr. Shen have discussed the mixed use of calcium gluconate and ascorbic acid with excessive concern and suspicion, which is completely based on the attitude of scholars and cannot be criticized. However, based on past knowledge, I have summarized and observed that the denaturation of calcium preparations in the digestive system and the differentiation in the blood are inevitable. Whether calcium gluconate still maintains its original structure when absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, and whether it still maintains its original structure when circulating in the blood, it is difficult to make a judgment lightly before it can be confirmed. However, it can be asserted that calcium gluconate and other acid-bound calcium must be denatured and decomposed to form insoluble calcium blocks before achieving the therapeutic purpose, whether in the gastrointestinal tract, in the blood, or in body tissues. What do the two gentlemen think?

### Infant Nutrition

— Jiang Yang Minxian Zhou Deqin

A person's physical health is affected by two factors: one is congenital heredity, and the other is the acquired environment. Leaving aside heredity for the moment, the environmental factors that affect health, though numerous, make the problem of nutrition particularly important, as the materials for the human body's various tissues and the source of its various active forces all depend on food. Infancy is the foundation of a lifetime, and in order to cultivate a good foundation, the food of infants cannot be ignored.

In principle, the nutritional needs of infants and adults are not significantly different. The difference is that infants' digestive organs are not yet fully developed, so their digestive function is weaker than that of adults. At the same time, infants grow and develop extremely rapidly, so infant food must not only provide for activity and repair of various parts of the body, but also have a surplus for growth and development. Therefore, the needs of infants, in proportion to their weight, are greater than those of adults. The most suitable food:

Breast milk: The most suitable food

From birth to one year of age, the most suitable food for infants is breast milk. Breast milk has the following important advantages over other foods: (1) The composition of breast milk changes with the infant's development. The yellowish and thin milk secreted by the mother within one or two days after delivery can be used to stimulate the secretion of milk. Milk within twelve days contains less fat and more protein. Milk within one month is very rich in fat and protein. However, from one month to nine months, the fat and protein in milk gradually become thinner. After nine months, it is even more so. Therefore, breastfeeding mothers should have supplementary foods after eight or nine months to supplement the lack of nutrients in breast milk. (2) Breastfeeding does not require transportation, preparation, and other procedures, which can reduce the chance of bacterial infection. Bacteria such as tuberculosis, typhoid fever, dysentery, and cholera can often be transmitted from cow's milk. (3) The sucking action of infants is beneficial to the development of the infant's oral cavity; at the same time, breastfeeding can help the mother's uterus return to its original state. (4) Breast milk is the most economical and convenient. Therefore, infants should be breastfed whenever possible. If the mother suffers from tuberculosis, pneumonia, breast carbuncles, epilepsy, venereal disease, or other chronic diseases, she has to stop breastfeeding. If the mother suffers from acute infectious diseases, such as dysentery and scarlet fever, she can temporarily stop breastfeeding and use a breast pump to express milk every day to prevent the milk from stopping secretion. After recovery, she can continue breastfeeding. If breast milk is insufficient, it is better to add other supplementary foods to breast milk. Do not suddenly stop breastfeeding. If the mother cannot breastfeed and wants to hire a wet nurse, the following points must be paid attention to when choosing a wet nurse: (1) The wet nurse's body must be examined, and the wet nurse must be healthy and free of infectious diseases. (2) The quality and quantity of the wet nurse's milk should be suitable for the needs of the infant. For example, the milk of a late-stage wet nurse is thin and does not meet the needs of an early-stage infant. Nature and its analysis

Properties and Analysis of Milk Substitutes

Artificial feeding mostly uses fresh cow's milk, goat's milk, evaporated milk, milk powder, and specially made soy milk as food for infants. The various milk substitutes are described below:

(A) Fresh cow's milk Fresh cow's milk contains more protein than human milk, but less lactalbumin, and casein, which is difficult to digest, accounts for 80-90%. Moreover, the milk curd formed by cow's milk in the stomach is slightly coarser and more difficult to digest than that of human milk. Cow's milk contains less carbohydrates than human milk. The amount of minerals is more than human milk, but the copper and iron content is less than human milk, so fresh cow's milk must be prepared before it can be a suitable food for infants. The preparation method is as follows: (1) Boil for three minutes to make the protein easy to digest and have a disinfection effect. (2) Add sugar to increase the carbohydrate content. Add five grams of sugar per 100 cc of cow's milk. Sucrose or maltose (syrup) can be used. The sugar can be reduced in the seventh month. At nine months, sugar can no longer be added, because at this time, the infant can eat other carbohydrate foods. Babies with loose stools should add less sugar, and those with hard stools can add more. (3) Add water to dilute the protein.

(B) Whole milk powder This is made by removing water from cow's milk. If one volume is added to four volumes of water, its composition is the same as fresh milk. Suitable milk can be obtained according to the preparation method of fresh milk.

(C) Evaporated milk This is made by evaporating milk and reducing the water content to half. If one part of water is added to one part of evaporated milk, its composition is the same as fresh milk.

(D) Goat's milk The protein and carbohydrate content is the same as cow's milk, only the fat is slightly higher, but the fat globules are small and easy to digest, and goat's milk has no possibility of tuberculosis transmission. Goat's milk can be used to feed weak infants or those with allergic reactions to cow's milk.

(E) Milk substitute soy milk The production of cow's and goat's milk in China is insufficient, so soy milk can be used as a substitute if it cannot be purchased. Ordinary soy milk and fried soy milk must be added with salt, milk calcium, starch, and sugar to supplement their ingredients and used as milk substitutes, because the content of inorganic substances and carbohydrates in soy milk is very low. After soybeans are fried, they are easy to grind and the protein is changed, making it easy to digest, so fried soy milk is suitable for infants. Those who eat milk substitute soy milk must eat cabbage water to supplement the lack of vitamin C, and fish liver oil to supplement the lack of fat and vitamins A and D. Egg yolk should be added at two or three months to increase protein and iron.

Ordinary milk substitute soy milk recipe: Add eight parts of water to one part by weight of soybeans and soak overnight, grind into a slurry with a stone mill, and squeeze with a sterilized cloth bag. Add 20 cc of starch, 40 cc of sugar, 2 cc of bone powder, and 1 cc of salt to every two market catties of soy milk, and boil for 20 minutes. Stir constantly while cooking to avoid clumping or scorching.

Fried soy milk recipe: Pour sand into the pot and heat it up. After the sand is hot, pour the soybeans into the pot and mix the beans and sand together. Stir evenly with an iron shovel. Fry the soybeans until they crackle and turn light brown (about 15 minutes). Pour the soybean sand into the sieve to sieve out the sand. Wait for the soybeans to cool before grinding. After sieving, put the remaining residue on the mill to grind again. Repeat this process four times until all the soybeans are ground into a very fine powder. Mix soybean flour (50 grams), white sugar (20 grams), starch (10 grams), salt (0.5 grams), bone powder (1 gram), and warm water together, mix well, and then add water to a volume of one pound. Then put the mixture on the fire and boil. After boiling, simmer on low heat for one hour. Stir evenly with a wooden shovel while cooking to avoid burning.

In addition to paying attention to the ingredients of milk substitutes, artificial feeding should pay attention to cleanliness to avoid contaminating bacteria. All foods such as milk, water, sugar, etc., and all utensils such as milk bottles, measuring cups, and spoons must be kept clean. After each use, they should be immersed in clean water to make it easier for waste to flow out, and then put into clean water to boil. Use tongs to put the nipple into a large-mouthed bottle that has been washed with boiling water. Leave the milk bottle in a pot of boiling water or place it on a plate washed with boiling water, covered with a clean cloth. After taking out all the items from the boiling water, do not touch them with fingers or other unsterilized objects. The prepared milk can be put in the refrigerator first, and heated in a pot of warm water when used.

If the amount of breast milk is insufficient, other milk substitutes can be used. Because breast milk has a higher nutritional value, breast milk should be fed first, and the insufficient amount should be supplemented by other milk substitutes.

Too much or too little milk intake than the infant's needs can easily cause illness. If there are no vomiting, diarrhea, or other discomfort symptoms, and the infant's weight increases normally, it indicates that the milk intake is normal. If growth is poor, it is a sign of insufficient milk intake. The amount of milk needed by infants varies with age, weight, and individual. Breastfed infants need two ounces of milk per pound of body weight. For artificially fed infants, it is best to ask a doctor for instructions. The following is a list of the amount of milk and sugar required per pound of body weight per day for reference.

### Marriage Health Certificate

— Xie Yunshou

The ancients regarded husband and wife as the starting point of human relations. Today, when we talk about the survival and development of the nation, we must naturally start with husband and wife. If the husband and wife who are connected in love have a morbid condition on one side, they will infect each other or pass it on to their descendants, producing unhealthy seeds. Unhealthy seeds are a major factor in the extinction of the nation. For example, as recorded by Pinsbi, the first generation of a family with mental illness was a wild drinker and lecher; the second generation suffered from epilepsy, depression, neurasthenia, and chorea; the third generation suffered from megalomania and depression; the fourth generation suffered from megalomania, nymphomania, intellectual disability, and idiocy; and by the fifth generation, the entire family was extinct. After reading such a record, we naturally shudder. To prevent problems before they occur and to prepare for a rainy day, it is a matter of course that both husband and wife should be healthy in their union.

In order to achieve the health of both sexes, there are of course various conditions that restrict marriage. For example, the reasons for marriage restrictions in the United States are as follows: first, mental illness; second, idiocy; third, dementia, mental retardation, epilepsy, venereal disease, those who are in debt, alcoholism, pulmonary tuberculosis, infectious diseases, and habitual offenders. The methods of adopting the above marriage restriction reasons vary from state to state. Some states adopt one type, and some adopt several types. We will now adopt the most important and easy-to-implement types and try them out first, namely, two major national diseases... venereal disease and tuberculosis.

First, let's discuss venereal disease! A man marries a beautiful woman; a woman marries a successful man; it is truly a happy and congratulatory event for a talented man and a beautiful woman. But unfortunately, after only a few days of happiness in the honeymoon, due to the relationship of being infected with venereal disease, gonorrhea, syphilis, and soft chancre occur, making the beautiful bride listless; the bridegroom! There are also unspeakable sufferings, making a small family full of joy turn into a hell shrouded in sorrow. Such a painful situation is difficult for people who have not experienced it to understand. I will now briefly explain the harm of venereal disease.

After contracting gonorrhea, in addition to local pain such as painful urination and purulent discharge, the most important thing for men is the occurrence of gonococcal orchitis, which causes infertility. For women, in addition to gonococcal urethritis, it can also rise to the uterus and fallopian tubes, causing infertility. More than half of female infertility can be attributed to gonorrhea. As for the excessive menstruation, leucorrhea, and abdominal pain during menstruation during uterine gonorrhea, it is also a lifetime of suffering.

Syphilis! In addition to the various pains such as hard chancre, syphilitic rash, muscle and bone pain, and visceral syphilis, the most important thing for both men and women is that it is transmitted to their descendants, causing congenital syphilis. Abortion and premature birth are the most important phenomena of syphilis. Medically, when encountering a woman who often has abortions, most of them are suspected of having syphilis. There is also a connection between syphilis and mental illness. According to statistics, one-third of mental illnesses are caused by syphilis.

In addition to syphilis and gonorrhea, venereal diseases also include soft chancre and inguinal lymphogranuloma venereum. Although they are not as important as gonorrhea and syphilis, they can also cause serious pain to your body after contracting them. According to what I have said above, we know that the harm of venereal disease is not a personal matter. It can be transmitted to the other party, and it can also affect the descendants, causing them to become extinct. From the perspective of national survival and development, it is truly an important factor in natural selection. In addition, if mental illness occurs due to syphilis, it is an uneasy factor for the family, the society, and the country. In addition, the loss of time and money caused by venereal disease is truly a major loss to the country!

The second is tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease, especially easier to transmit between husband and wife. After husband and wife are infected, they can also pass the tuberculosis constitution on to their descendants. That is, the children born to tuberculous couples are prone to tuberculosis. In addition, the national knowledge of seed residence is naive, and most people do not know to pay attention to the transmission of tuberculosis bacteria. Unknowingly, children also develop tuberculosis, so most of them die young before reaching middle age. People who talk about Feng Shui will wag their tongues, saying that the Feng Shui of a certain family's tomb is not good, and that generations are single men. The direction of a certain family's house is unlucky, and they do not leave descendants. In fact, what is the relationship between the tomb base and the house? Isn't it the mischief of tuberculosis bacteria!

Therefore, if we want to create a healthy family and protect the prosperity of the nation, before both sexes marry, everyone must present a health certificate to prove the health of both parties. This certificate may be more important than education, status, wealth, beauty, etc.!

Every pound of the baby needs two ounces of liquid, remove the total amount of milk, then you can get the amount of water, the baby's food intake and needs often vary from person to person, so the above amount should be slightly increased or decreased depending on the situation.

It is not necessary to feed the baby within twelve hours after delivery, give a little water every two hours (5% glucose or sucrose solution can be used). After the milk is secreted, breastfeed once every three or four hours depending on the strength of the baby. 2:00 a.m., 6:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m., 6:00 p.m., and 10:00 p.m. are the most suitable times. By two months, the 2:00 a.m. feeding can be reduced by one time, and after nine months, the 10:00 p.m. feeding can also be stopped. Weak babies suck very little each time and can be breastfed every three hours before the third or fourth month. Give warm boiled water between two feedings, 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 8:00 p.m. are appropriate. The first week after birth, 1 ounce of water can be fed each time, 1.5 ounces of water can be fed each time in the second week, and then half an ounce can be added each month, and 4 ounces can be fed each time after eight months. Drinking water can be replaced by fruit juice or vegetable juice. The breastfeeding time should not be too long, preferably about 20 minutes. If the time is too long, the baby may inhale air, causing stomach distension and reduced appetite. If the baby's sucking power is insufficient, the milk can be squeezed out with a bottle after sucking for a few minutes. Babies should avoid sleeping while breastfeeding. Artificial feeding should not be too fast, and the size of the nipple should be appropriate (one drop should flow every three inches when the bottle is inverted). The mother and baby should not be disturbed during breastfeeding. After each breastfeeding, the baby should be held upright. Let the baby's head rest on the adult's shoulder, and pat the back to allow air to escape from the mouth.

The nutrients in breast milk or cow's milk are lacking, so both natural breastfeeding and artificial feeding need foods rich in minerals and vitamins to supplement them. At the same time, adding supplementary nutrients can reduce the difficulty of weaning later, so it is used as a preparation for weaning. The supplementary foods are described below:

(A) Fruit juice or vegetable juice: Artificially fed infants should start adding foods rich in vitamin C such as orange juice within one month, and breastfed infants should start adding them after three months. Feed twice a day, one or two spoons each time, gradually increasing to one or two ounces. If orange juice is not suitable, grapefruit or tomato, radish, lotus root, cabbage, or various green vegetable juices can be used instead. Sugar can be added when it is too sour. The amount of vitamin C in vegetables is less than that in oranges, so the amount must be increased compared to orange juice. The amount of tomato juice should be doubled compared to orange juice, and the amount of cabbage juice should be tripled.

Vitamin C is easily damaged by high heat, so the sterilization time of each item should not be too long. The temperature should not be too high. At the same time, it is best to make and eat it immediately to avoid the loss of vitamin C.

a Fresh orange juice recipe: The fruit and juicer must be disinfected. Cut into large pieces, place in the juicer, and rotate several times. The fruit juice flows into the filter, and add an equal amount of cooled boiled water.

b Tomato juice recipe: Wash the tomatoes and put them in a steamer for ten minutes, then put them in a sterilized gauze bag and squeeze them out. Add an equal amount of warm boiled water.

c Radish juice recipe: After washing the radish, immerse it in boiling water with the utensils for disinfection. Use a grater to rub the radish into shreds, and place it in a gauze bag to squeeze out the juice. (To be continued)

### Afterword to "Drafts of Futh-tang Poetry and Prose"

— Chen Youqin

I chanced upon an old edition of "Futh-tang Poetry," in three volumes, and "Prose," in one volume, by Tan Xian (Zhongxiu), the most famous Hangzhou literati of the Qing Dynasty, at an old book stall in Hangzhou. I spent the equivalent of a pack of cigarettes, or one thousand yuan, and this fine book was in my possession.

Although it is not a fragment from the "Futh-tang Collected Works," it is a reprinting of the Fuzhou edition based on the Beijing edition of the ninth year of Xianfeng (1859). The inscription at the beginning of the book reads "Sanshan Ki Shi Wu Yutian," showing how seriously the engraver took his work.

Having never read the "Futh-tang Collected Works," acquiring this book is a small consolation and better than nothing.

My knowledge of Tan Futh-tang comes from reading "A Selection of Qing Dynasty Poetry with Commentary," compiled by Xu Ke Zhongke of Hangxian, published in 1926. Almost all the commentary in that book is attributed to "Master Tan Futh-tang said." I thought, since it's Tan Futh-tang's commentary, why didn't the editor rename the book "Tan Futh-tang's Commentary on a Selection of Qing Dynasty Poetry?" (Only a very few poems in the entire book use Kuang Kui-sheng's commentary).

Later, I read Wu Mei's "General Treatise on Poetry," which discusses Tan Tingxian (Tan Xian was also known as Tingxian). He says: "Zhongxiu's poetry takes a very high path, its origins and branches reaching deeply. Peering into his mind and vision, he not only disdains Chen (Qinian) and Zhu (Zhuzhai), but also traces back to the Tang and Five Dynasties. This is a transformation of Zhejiang poetry. Zhongxiu himself said: 'The poetry of Nanjing is exhausted, trivial and cluttered. Those who study Zhu and Li become impoverished beggars. Mei'an is lofty and bright, Pinjia is clear and sparse, transforming Zhejiang poetry.' I say that Wu and Guo are not worthy of this statement; it is Futh-tang who transformed Zhejiang poetry..." Wu Mei Guang-sheng valued and esteemed Futh-tang so highly.

His friend Zhuang Yu (Zhongbai) of Dantu, in his preface to Futh-tang's poetry, said: "...Among recent authors, Zhuzhai extracts the essence and discards the dross of the Song, Mingke traces the origins but does not exhaust the ramifications. In terms of the interest within the meaning and beyond the words, Zhongxiu's work is almost without flaw..." This is not flattery, but a true assessment shared by the ancients.

As for Futh-tang's poetry, his friend Wu Huaizhen said it most earnestly:

"...Now, when you write poetry, what stirs your heart and moves your emotions, I truly do not know what you feel and why, and even I cannot fully grasp the meaning. Yet it is gentle and penetrating, moving and touching, making people sing, shout, grieve, and rejoice uncontrollably. It is essentially the same as the ancient writers, springing from the correctness of feelings. Alas! What is deeply felt is painful, what is difficult to say is profound. How painful and profound are his words!..."

Opening and reading Futh-tang's poetry, one feels that although his output is not large, it truly deserves Wu Huaizhen's praise. His initial collection contains eighty-six poems, the "Northern Expedition Poems" one hundred and four, and the "Min Travel Poems" ninety, only two hundred and eighty in total. But each poem is exquisite, likely because the author himself edited and revised them, combining the strengths of the authors of the Han, Wei, Six Dynasties, and early Tang, and forming his own style. He disdained those of the middle and late Tang and later periods. The more one reads, the more lovable they become. In the "Selection of Qing Dynasty Quatrains" (Kaiming edition) that I compiled in the past, I only selected three quatrains he wrote in Gaoyou (see page 97), a mere taste, not glimpsing the full picture. Now, seeing his collection, almost all of his ancient and modern poems are excellent. The ancient style poems are too long, making it inconvenient to cite many examples. His regulated verses, such as: "Presented to Master Wang Yifeng of Yizheng":

Climbing the tower, I write an elegy, doubly sorrowful,
Wang Can, year after year, at a crossroads;
The smoke and haze of the lost land grieve my flesh and blood,
The famous scholars who crossed the river are close to being adrift.
In the years of war, people are colorless,
In writing, the mountains and rivers are finely intertwined.
The west wind blows, leaves falling, the river is wide,
Thinking of home, I lie ill, when the wild geese arrive.

Sending Master Shou Qiao Back to Zhuji:

How is the night in the wind and rain? The migrating geese have all crossed
the River.
The master is still on the road, the country is in the midst of warfare.
In his twilight years, his heroic heart remains, with a deep cup of turbid wine,
There is no need to face the Yi River; farewells are full of sorrowful songs.

Reading them today, they are still enough to stir one's heart.

His short poems in the plain style, such as "A Little Cart":

The little cart creaks along the yellow sand,
An old father in front, a young child behind,
Inviting passersby by the roadside, but they only shake their heads.
For three days, no wheat porridge has entered my mouth,
My home, Yangzhou, was a place of peaceful rest;
When the bandits came like the wind, the eldest son was hanged;
The white sun is dim, the Huai River is vast;
The flying mosquitoes pierce the sky, people are cheap as grass.
The drums and horns of the barracks sound all day long,
Strong men and fat horses fill the roads,
The little cart creaks, hauling horse fodder." The atmosphere is like "An Orphan's Song." I never imagined that the situation in northern Jiangsu today is still the same as the author's time.

Futh-tang's prose consists of twenty-nine pieces in Volume A and twenty-nine pieces in Volume B. I have read these fifty-eight poems almost a thousand times. The six chapters of "Butterfly Loves Flowers," appreciated by Wu Quan'an, are indeed echoes of Wen and Wei, and cannot be imitated by those who only study the Southern Song. Even his "Bodhisattva Man" poems are not inferior to those of Tingyun.

The "General Treatise on Poetry" quotes his work "Golden Pavilion Song, Tangqi Moonlit Night" (see page 182 of the original book). I particularly love his "Full Courtyard Fragrance":

"The flowers are about to depart, the song is like a pet, my mood is not like it used to be,
Peach mats dreaming, green wine talking about the old days.
The ground is full of ivy, like water, no one comes to the Doucao fence.
The wind begins to rise, pond duckweed a speck at a time, shaking, it cannot make a circle.
Outside the Yangliu trees, freshly tuned pipes, half new strings.
Try to ask again who told the old stories of Qilu Palace, bearing the late wind and dew,
the trees of the parting pavilion are lightly stained with smoke. The sound slowly dies, the high tower, the micro-moon, green sleeves divide the heavy .

In the book, there is a postscript written in the personal calligraphy of Huang Chongxing Zici:

"Futh-tang Poetry and Prose, a total of four volumes, written by Tan Tingxian Zhongxiu of Hangzhou. Since Chongxing knew poetry, this is the only contemporary poet he has seen. Zhongxiu is now the magistrate of my county, but I have not yet met him. I obtained his engraved poems in Gaocha , brought them home, and every time I unfold and enjoy them, my heart and eyes feel refreshed. Written in the winter of the fourth year of Guangxu (1878) by Huang Chongxing at his residence in Fuzhou."

The calligraphy is excellent, and the seals and ten inkpads are all top-notch. I do not know what kind of person Mr. Huang is, but from the postscript, I know that he was a contemporary of Tan Xian, and that Tan Xian not only served as the magistrate of HanShan County, but also once served as the magistrate of She County. This volume was obtained by Mr. Huang in Fuzhou. I do not know how it flowed into the hands of a Hangzhou person. Today, I was able to obtain it in exchange for a mere box of cigarettes, treating it as a priceless treasure. Fortunately, I did not allow the hawkers to tear it apart and use it to wrap peanuts. It cannot be said that this book's encounter was not fortunate.

### Concerning Wallace

— Zhongqi

Edgar Wallace (1875-1932), a popular British novelist, was a prolific writer. Around 1928, Britain truly experienced "Wallace mania." At the time, publishers estimated that on average, one out of every four books sold was written by Wallace. Later, someone proposed in The Times to build a "Wallace Museum" in London, where one could see the great writer who wrote novels with his right hand, plays with his left hand, essays with his left foot, and theater reviews with his right foot - Wallace.

### Lady Bardwinati

— Badewi Naiti

Profile portraits were popular in ancient times. Giotto and Bardwinati (1425-1499)'s portrait of Lady Bardwinati are world-famous treasures.

Bardwinati produced very few works in his life, and those he did create were exquisite and meticulous, regardless of time or effort. It is said that this portrait took a full four years to complete, and every strand of golden hair and every pearl was painted with meticulous detail. The patterns on the clothing were especially carefully crafted. The entire surface of the painting is like a relief on a gold pound, protruding from the canvas and able to be touched by hand. The work is currently housed in the National Gallery in London. (Liu Shi)

### Introduction to the Journal of Nantong College

— Zhang Yuanyang

Nantong College has been established for more than forty years. Alumni are all over the country. The long history of the school and the large number of graduates rank it among the top institutions of higher education in the country. In the past, the virtuous sage Mr. Zhang Jian, for the sake of national modernization and industrialization, founded specialized schools of spinning, weaving, medicine, and other disciplines in Nantong, aiming to cultivate specialized talents in various practical fields in a corner of the country, laying the talent foundation for the national industry. At the same time, he successively established various reclamation and animal husbandry companies and textile companies in the coastal counties, aiming to establish scale and lay the business foundation for the national agriculture and industry. His far-sightedness, thorough planning, grand ambition, and resolute action, even viewed today, forty years later, are still brand new and forward-looking. His person and his deeds are even more worthy of emulation for all time and admiration by the world. Nantong College inherently possesses the founder's creative spirit and excellent traditions, and looking to the future, it has an even greater mission to undertake. Therefore, although the school is privately run, the support from all parties is indispensable. Although the location of the school is in a remote corner, the talents recruited come from all over the country. Although the disciplines of the school are limited to specialized technical training in agriculture, textile, medicine, and pharmacy, the cadres trained are often able to supply the needs of national construction projects. In this way, progressing step by step, adapting to change, burying oneself in learning and transmission, and not seeking fame and fortune, has been the case for forty years. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War ten years ago, Nantong fell into the hands of the enemy. Nantong College was forced to move to the sea. In the middle of the process, it experienced hardships and struggles, but it was still able to maintain its independent and unyielding vitality, and the sound of singing has never stopped. This is still due to the school's inherent great history and excellent traditions. In April after the victory, Yuanyang, following the instructions of the school board, came to take charge of school affairs. At the beginning of his tenure, he followed the intention of the school board and announced the following guidelines: (1) Restore the school in Nantong, (2) Restore the honest and simple learning style, (3) Inherit the tradition of enterprise. I will briefly explain each of these separately:

First: Why must the school be restored in Nantong? In terms of the suitable environment for running higher education, every major trading and economic center is prosperous and noisy, which is not conducive to running a school. Although there are a few teaching conveniences, it is particularly unfavorable to the basic tasks of cultivating the young minds and educating the character of young people. Nantong has a quiet environment, suitable for studying. The model of the sages is still there, and it is enough to provide the young people with lingering admiration everywhere. Although there is a river separating it from Shanghai, transportation is slightly inconvenient, but the school buildings are spacious, and the scale of farms, yarn factories, and hospitals are all complete, which is convenient for research and practical training. Therefore, restoring the school in Nantong is the first priority to continue the school's glorious life. Last fall, five classes of new students were enrolled and are all taking classes in Nantong. After the summer this year, it is still planned to continue enrolling new students in Nantong. If the area is safe and the bandits are silent, it is expected that the entire school will return to its old buildings in a short period of time to lay the permanent foundation of the college.

Second: Why must the honest and simple learning style be restored? The learning style of Nantong College has always been honest and simple. Students immersed themselves in research, diligent and hard-working, only seeking to acquire knowledge to serve the world. The teachers also adhered to the ancient training of respecting the teacher and valuing the way, tirelessly transmitting and imparting knowledge, and were only engaged in imparting knowledge and teaching skills. This is entirely based on the original intention of the founder. When the founder, Zhang Jian, was alive, he repeatedly instructed the students to pay attention to guiding students into the realms of peace of mind, endurance of hardship, reading more, and discussing less. Therefore, all the people who graduated from Nantong College, whether scattered in the educational circles, all adhered to this principle, adhered to the truth and embraced simplicity, and worked hard in their positions, which has become a trend. Since the school moved to Shanghai, students were infected with the prevailing frivolous habits of the time. At the same time, due to complex environmental perceptions, their bodies could not be at ease and their hearts could not be at peace. They also had no self-run factories or farms to use for practical training. Occasionally, they followed teachers to visit and browse, seeing the flowers while riding a horse, which was not enough to talk about enduring hardship and practicing labor. At the same time, the school lacked books and the social atmosphere of reading was not strong, so most courses were taught through lectures and general discussions, and activities were used to replace practical training. Commentators said that the restoration of Nantong College is easy, but the restoration of the learning style is difficult. It cannot be said that this is without reason. Last autumn, the school board decided to first establish the new student class in Nantong. The main purpose was to gradually restore the excellent learning style and reading atmosphere of the past, starting from the new student class. The intention was very profound.

Third: Why must the tradition of enterprise be inherited? The reason is very clear, and there is no need to elaborate. The enterprises founded by Zhang Jian of Nantong form a system in itself. There is a famous saying: "Father education, mother industry." Education and industry must be coordinated, just like the phenomenon in the universe that solitary Yin does not generate and solitary Yang does not grow, and rain falls only after Yin and Yang are in harmony. Education is a means, while the development of industry and the use of resources for the benefit of the people is the goal. If education does not cultivate talents for industry, or the talents cultivated are still not applicable to the needs of various departments of industry, then this educational facility is no different from waste. Therefore, education and industry should complement each other and cooperate with each other, so that construction can have a basis and the country can be built.

The future of Nantong College depends on whether these three missions can be gradually completed. To complete these missions, it depends on the common understanding and concentrated efforts of all teachers and students of the school. This journal was born in order to achieve this task. In other words, the task of this journal is to figure out how to mobilize all the teachers and students of the school to quickly prepare to return to Nantong and no longer linger in the prosperous sea? How to encourage all the teachers and students of the school to advocate practicality and eliminate extravagance, and restore the industrious and simple learning style of the past? How to encourage all the teachers and students of the school to accept the tradition, inherit the cause of the sages, and promote and develop it? As for its own editing style, classification columns, and writing skills, these are things for the editors to worry about and will not be discussed in detail. Only whether it can meet the objective expectations is not certain. It is hoped that colleagues in the school and distant colleagues will often offer pearls and jade, and do not hesitate to give instructions, so that this journal can continue to grow and prosper and achieve its ideal mission. Then it will not only be a blessing for Yuanyang alone.

### Green Apple

— Ke Ren

Rain threads dance in the air.

A kind of passionate and uneasy emotion shocks me, making it difficult for me to find a moment of peace. I always feel like something is hanging in my heart, heavy and painful. In fact, everything is already in place, and I'm just waiting to leave. Could there be anything I can't bear to part with on this grassland? Except for her—that beautiful and melancholic child; but I've already said goodbye to her... Finally, I put on my raincoat, grabbed an umbrella, and walked to the muddy road.

Her school is quite a distance away, requiring walking the entire length of this road, and then walking a section of sandy road outside the city. On rainy days, that section of road is filled with puddles of various sizes and depths. But these problems don't bother me at all. I only feel relaxed and happy at this moment; just like the emotions of someone who has been entangled in bitter thoughts, after making a painful decision one morning.

I met her in the reception room of her school:

"Let's go out!" I stared at her; although my tone was a little rushed, I tried my best to maintain a musical quality.

"No! There's still class"; she seemed a little reserved and cold.

Experience and intelligence help me to perceive the heart of a young girl decorated with green leaves and thorny fruits; therefore, I approached her, wearing an enthusiastic and sincere expression:

"Meiben, let's go, I'll ask for leave for you, definitely!"

She hesitated for a long time, and finally said softly:

"Okay, then you go ahead."

I guessed that she was afraid of being laughed at by her classmates.

Outside the school gate, I handed her the umbrella. She didn't say anything. We hadn't walked far when I called two rickshaws. The rain was still dancing softly. I leaned over to peek, wanting to steal a look at her face through the gap in the raincloth under the rickshaw; did she like it after all? Or was she annoyed? But my eyes were always limited to her chest, to a small golden flower woven on her red sweater.

A quarter of an hour later, we were already sitting in the restaurant of Lele Restaurant.

I said triumphantly and tenderly:

"Today is our first time going out alone, right? A memorable time."

She smiled, a leisurely smile, and the reserved and cold color just now faded away completely.

When a young man first dates a girlfriend, it's often hard to know where to start the conversation. After getting used to it, he naturally talks and laughs freely. At this time, I was like preparing for a careful old exam, always using appropriate techniques to adjust our conversation.

She suddenly asked me if I had a girlfriend in S city. I told her solemnly:

"Girlfriend and lover are two completely different things. You might as well make more boyfriends, but among those friends, you should choose the most understanding one."

She lowered her head slightly. Was what she was thinking about in the same world as what I was thinking about?

The rain stopped. I invited her to dance and take a walk before going back. She agreed happily.

I walked close to her, but always kept a little distance. The sky was getting close to dusk, and it was right after the rain, so the road was very quiet. Should I hold her arm to walk? Wouldn't that be very natural and ordinary? But, she is Zhang Yuan; therefore, I didn't do what I thought about after all.

On the way, I accompanied her to visit one of her classmates, who was also leaving this place in the next two days. She earnestly instructed her to write more letters after she left; I suddenly remembered that she had repeatedly told me to send fewer letters after I left. Why is that? Is it because I am a man that her family would blame her?

After walking out of her classmate's house, she stood close to me at the door when she waved goodbye; a flower bloomed in my heart.

It was already dark when I sent her home. I planned to create a farewell kiss when we parted, or at least print the kiss on her palm. But things often happen unexpectedly; when we reached a few steps from her door, she only said "Here," and hurried up, waving to me while shouting at the door. I couldn't see the expression on her face in the dim light.

A mysterious place, a mysterious child...

The next day, I set off for the eastern coast; at the station, she sent a bag of green apples produced from the grassland, with a piece of paper sandwiched inside, which read:

"Bless you, make more close friends outside."

I was at a loss. I picked up a cute little green apple at random, and used it to throw it out the window, wishing my feelings to stay with it on the grassland.

### Poetry

— Yu Heng

Songs are more intuitive compared to poems, because they combine with musical scores to form music. Musical scores are generated from emotions and give rise to imagination; lyrics are generated from imagination and develop emotions.

Poems combine the artistic and literary values of painting, music, novels, essays...

### An Inch of Mountain, a River of Blood 515

— Ye Jingfeng

"Hello..." He Jian grabbed the phone receiver, "Who? Ah, yes, Mr. Shouyi? Please ask him to come up quickly..." It turned out to be the hotel phone, reporting that Shouyi had arrived.

"It's very strange, how did the hotel not notice when this young lady came just now?" He Jian asked himself. He didn't expect that this young lady, being so incredibly resourceful, still didn't have a way to mix into the hotel?

"Did you meet your sister?" He Jian greeted Shouyi at the elevator door, and asked this question as soon as they met.

"Who?" Shouyi was a little stunned.

"That young lady who went downstairs just now, dragging two small braids, quite beautiful?" He Jian invited Shouyi into the room, telling Shouyi.

"Oh, a round face," Shouyi sat down, half guessing, "a smile with two dimples, a Beijing accent, a very sweet voice, a pair of big eyes, rolling around..."

"That's right, isn't she your sister?" He Jian officially became suspicious.

"Hey, her?" Shouyi chuckled.

"Isn't it her?... Sixteen or seventeen years old?..." He Jian made up for the age, fearing that Shouyi had guessed the wrong person, "Her?..."

"She is one of the four great mischievous people of our Baisizhuang, Yan, the Yan of color - named Zishan. She is the youngest, but also the most mischievous... and also a troublemaker!... But how did she get here?... What did she come to do?..." Shouyi asked He Jian.

"Hey,... it's a long story..., this is really a long story." He Jian was a little bit amused and speechless when he thought of what Zishan had just done.

"You suffered a loss?" Shouyi saw He Jian's awkward face.

"The people of your Baisizhuang are really amazing!" He Jian then briefly told Shouyi what had just happened.

Shouyi smiled, and suddenly frowned, "Not good... she asked about Pingzi's appearance?" Shouyi fixed his eyes and asked He Jian, and then muttered to himself; "These roles are causing trouble again... the good plan is afraid that they will mess it up..."

"What?" He Jian was surprised and suspicious.

"We have to go quickly...!" Shouyi looked at his watch.

"What exactly is going on?" He Jian didn't understand the main idea of Shouyi's words.

"Originally, I had an appointment with Li Ming, to meet with the manpower from the Korean side, at 10:30 at the entrance of the Bund Park, to attack Hongzhen.... Why did we have to go at 10:30? Because I was at the Juechang Old Man and Xiaozhuang and my brother's plan, before 10:30, I sent two teams of people from my village to clear the remaining two windows for them and take out the 'hostage.' But now..." Shouyi pondered, and was looking at his watch again.

Free Talk

### Random Musings from Solitude

— Wang Cong

It is difficult to depict pain when in pain.

Only when the pain has been determined, in other words, when the pain has had a considerable distance from oneself, can it be depicted. Ancient Chinese poets seemed to understand this very clearly, it is called "thinking of the pain after the pain has been determined."

All experiences are the same as pain. It is difficult to have appropriate insights during the experience.

Getting too close to another face will make it unclear (naturally, being too far is the same). A considerable spatial distance must be maintained.

Poets, philosophers... all people with particularly keen senses can maintain a considerable distance between their body and soul. In distance, one can seek truth, goodness, and beauty.

Distance is not alienation. Schopenhauer has a good metaphor: On a cold winter day, many porcupines huddled together, trying to get warmth. But when they were pricked by the arrows brought by each other, they had to disperse. The cold made them gather again, and they scattered again when they gathered too tightly. Finally, they learned from experience that maintaining an appropriate distance was the most suitable. Not only can they get some slight warmth, but they won't hurt each other.

This is a valuable fable, worth hearing by "the laughing animal" (it is said that only humans can laugh).

I have a chronic habit of writing articles under lamplight late at night. I am ashamed that my thoughts are like fireflies. In the sunlight, I can't even see myself.

Some people laugh at me as a night owl. I can only use a famous British saying to comfort myself:

"Darkness is more productive of sublime ideas than light."

### "Anchor" Returns from Tokyo

— Baoqing

A few days ago, the first merchant ship, Xing'an, seized during the war and returned, sailed back to the embrace of the motherland from Japan. On board were two iron anchors and chains, and eight cannonballs. These shameful antiques were displayed by the Japanese at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo as war trophies commemorating the Sino-Japanese War.

The anchors have finally returned from Tokyo! But recalling the history of these two anchors, and the negotiations for their return, their experiences are also the experiences of the nation! During the Sino-Japanese War, the Beiyang Fleet of our country was completely destroyed after the battles of Fengdao, the Yellow Sea, and the defense of Weihaiwei. The battleships Dingyuan, cruisers Laiyuan, Jingyuan, Zhiyuan, Chengyuan, gunboats Weiji, Meiyun, and torpedo boats were sunk. The warships Yongwei and Yangwei were burned by shells, and the Guangjia capsized after hitting a reef. The Zhenyuan-class gunboats Zhenyuan, Pingyuan, and Kangji, etc., were forced to surrender at Liugong Island and other places due to lack of ammunition and reinforcements. Although our fleet had some with large displacements, such as the Zhenyuan, with a displacement of 7,430 tons, which was much larger than the largest Japanese warship with a displacement of 4,278 tons, they all had poor armor, artillery, and speed, and the army failed to cooperate and exert combat power. However, the spirit of heroic battle has been greatly written in history. The iron anchors were taken from the captured ships such as the Zhenyuan.

News of the negotiations for the return of the iron anchors first came in mid-March last year from a Central News Agency dispatch, saying that the Japanese were willing to return the iron anchors of the Zhenyuan ship captured in the Sino-Japanese War to China. Later, our government requested MacArthur's headquarters to order the return of the aforementioned items. In July, MacArthur's headquarters rejected China's request to return the iron anchors, saying that Japan had no right to dispose of property acquired before 1937. However, the authority of the Allied headquarters to detain Japanese war criminals since the "September 18th" Incident surely extended beyond 1937? At this time, our new fleet was returning from the United States via Japan.

Now the anchors and cannonballs have been returned. During this year, how many negotiations did the delegation to Japan go through? However, the number of shameful antiques of our country existing in Japanese shrines and other public places is far more than these. The Qing Dynasty's dragon flags, military uniforms, general's cannons, etc., from the Sino-Japanese War must still be on display in many places. This requires our compatriots to pay attention at all times and expose them at all times. It is also the unshirkable responsibility of our delegation to investigate and negotiate for their return in a timely manner.

### Welcoming Gods and Temple Fairs

— Yun

Recently, according to people from my hometown, welcoming gods and temple fairs are very popular everywhere. Not only are puppets, mud gods, ox-headed horse-faced figures very active, but also many local tyrants and hooligans take this opportunity to gamble, perform plays, and stay up all night, causing great disorder in the local area. There are also those who are ruined by gambling.

Leaving aside the question of how superstitious welcoming gods and temple fairs are, they are always a kind of rural behavior that whitewashes a prosperous age. Originally, in a peaceful and prosperous rural society, everyone worked hard for a year, and it was not too much to use welcoming gods and temple fairs to relax and entertain themselves. But what day is it today? Rural areas are bankrupt, and the lives of farmers are unbearably miserable. How can we bear to see such expensive temple fairs waste the little money farmers have?

Therefore, some idle people in the countryside initiate welcoming gods and temple fairs to embellish peace, but in reality, they contain countless blood, sweat, and tears of the farmers.

### Cars and Types

— Fengli

After the victory, various cars appeared on the streets of Shanghai. I have ridden in these cars, but I can't name them. Driven by curiosity, I conducted a survey and provided it for readers' reference: Bus Traffic car Cheese Box Staff car Commander Command car Crane Crane Jeep Jeep motor cycle Motorcycle personnary carrier Infantry car pick up Transport car sedan Sedan staion wagon Station wagon truck Truck weapons carrier Ordnance carrier

### "Youth China"

— Wubian

The national liberation war led the youth of China to the front line of the war against Japan. They participated in troop service, went deep into the countryside, organized the masses, mobilized the masses, eliminated the gap between the military and the people, and made the army and the people one, completing the highest requirement of military-civilian cooperation. This is the contribution of those Chinese youths who served in the Anti-Japanese War.

However, the political work team in the play did not know so much from birth. They only learned constantly in their work, which enabled them to overcome the difficulties in their work. At the same time, more importantly, the playwright Yang Hansheng correctly pointed out that propaganda cannot only rely on selling "dog skin plasters" to be effective, but must relieve their pain and truly serve them, so that the military and the people can become one family.

Following "Eight Thousand Miles of Cloud and Moon", this is another film depicting intellectual youth serving on the battlefield. In fact, this "Youth China" was produced in the Great Rear Area, and it was produced very early, so now it seems that some places always have a considerable distance.

However, due to the simplicity of the script, the director has achieved considerable success in the performance.

What is even more rare is that this film almost included all the famous actors in the Great Rear Area, Tao Jin, Wei Heling, Xiang Kun, Wu Yin, Sun Jianbai, Zhang Manping, Yang Wei, etc. participated, and Bai Yang's political work team, Lin Fei's mother Li, and Qian Qianli's teacher Lu are the most outstanding in acting.

This is a film worth recommending.

### Woman · Woman — Additional Remarks on "Song of a Wanderer"

— Luobin

After watching "Song of a Wanderer," I had many feelings and couldn't help but make these additional remarks.

Woman, the definition of this proper noun, seems that no one has ever given a correct annotation. Especially in our country, she is like a beast of burden, a vase, a reproductive machine, a tool for venting desire... all kinds of things that men can buy wholesale and retail. She is "dung" that can be trampled on at will, a "bane" that can ruin the country and harm the body, a "rare commodity" that can be exchanged for wealth and honor. In short, she is everything all-encompassing.

Since the ancient sages advocated classics, rituals, and laws, as half of the living beings that make up our society, they have been "equally" "treated favorably" and "abused". Freedom of knowledge, freedom of work, and even freedom of survival, are all handled by men. From soul to body, they are enslaved by the power of men. Whoever is the least free, the most obedient, and the most able to obtain the title of "virtuous" will be respected.

Although there have been some famous women in history, such as the ancient Greek beauty Helen and our Chen Yuanyuan, who have caused long-term wars of suffering for the people, their every move could overturn a country, but in all fairness, they were still victims of men's possessiveness, and men pushed them to that position.

For thousands of years, there have been too many physical, mental, and ideological constraints pressing on women's heads and instilled in their minds. In other words, the power of men in opposition to them is still too strong. To give an example: in Shanghai last year, the number of abandoned babies, of which women accounted for an absolute majority. This is the largest city in the East, and the gender concepts of ordinary people are still like this. If we extend it to remote inland areas with backward education, youth culture, and economy, undoubtedly, this phenomenon must be even more serious.

Here, I want to solemnly declare that I am not a pessimist of fate. Pointing out this phenomenon is only to prove that the road for women to fight for freedom and liberation is full of difficulties. In addition to those objectively existing obstacles, there are still many problems in themselves. For example, Ruoying in "Song of a Wanderer" is a typical representative. Her thoughts and soul are completely succumbed to male power and compromise with her own weakness, and there are indeed many such women. Of course, we cannot blame all this on women, because the creation of this situation is the result of thousands of years of male dominance.

However, if women want to gain true liberation, they must first revolutionize themselves, abandon those habits of living in ease and dependence, and not be satisfied with freedom in name only. First, there must be an independent personality, and then we can talk about other things.

To say it again, this is not a unilateral responsibility of women. If this unreasonable phenomenon continues, it is also a shame for men, because they are unwilling to give up their privileges.

### Mozart's Ears (Anecdote)

— Kedi

"Music prodigy" Mozart (Mozart 1756-1791), the reason why he became a world-renowned composer is not only that his talent is still regarded as a miracle by the world, but also that he has a pair of ears different from others.

When she was four or five years old, she could hear the subtle differences in the pitch of sounds. Once, after listening to a guest play the violin, she said to the guest:

"The sound of your violin is about a quarter of a tone different from the sound of my violin."

Mozart often liked to go to church to listen to long musical performances. After listening to them, he often recorded them based on the impressions left in his mind, and the results were accurate to the millimeter. Such ears are truly rare in the world! According to European scholars' research on the structure of his ears, they are indeed different from ordinary people. This is a unique talent.

However, although Mozart had this pair of ears that deeply understood music, he was most afraid of hearing people play the "trombone" when he was young. He often said:

"This sound is about to shatter my ears!"

From this situation, it seems that a person who can appreciate subtle music is often quite incompatible with the kind of loud music.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Three years of military training were not entirely in vain. Director Xiong was ashamed and turned his anger into action, and immediately threw the poor woman down again. This time, he used even more force. The woman was thrown to the ground with her limbs splayed, her face upturned, and she lay on the ground for a long time, unable to move, panting like an ox.

"Good!" Many heartless people shouted from the sidelines.

Zhang Chang couldn't help but feel a surge of anger, and immediately shook off Feifei's hand and stepped forward.

"Hey! Little Zhang! Little Zhang!..." Lu Qian, who was standing behind him, was afraid that he would cause trouble and hurriedly wanted to stop him.

"Woo...woo..." However, the air raid siren was louder and more effective than his shouts. Not only had Zhang Chang, who was about to rush up to fight for justice, stopped, but also the fat woman lying on the ground immediately struggled to get up like a rolling ball. Director Hou and his wife, who were already sitting in the driver's seat, didn't have time to automatically let go of their superior seats that they had just taken and hurriedly jumped out of the car. Director Tai and Company Commander Liu were busy leading them to run to the nearby air-raid shelter. The idlers and people in the car also fled in the chaos by seventy or eighty percent. The serious invasion of the Japanese planes in the past two days has frightened the Guilin people, who have never been very afraid of air raids.

Zhu Zhaonian, who was fully responsible for the troupe, was busy directing everyone to get off the bus and let Lu Qian lead the way to hide in the air-raid shelter first. He and the worker Lao Huang stayed in the car to guard the things.

Soon, the emergency alarm sounded again.

"What! You didn't leave?" At this time, Lao Zhu realized that the original Zhang Chang, with a face full of anger, was standing next to the driver's seat like a stone statue. His eyes were wide open, staring at the crowd running around in front, and his chest seemed to contain infinite grief and indignation.

Lao Zhu saw that he didn't speak, so he jumped out of the car and gently patted him on the shoulder.

"Did what you just saw make you angry, you scholar?"

The young man in his twenties still did not answer.

"The enemy planes are coming soon! They will really bomb indiscriminately these two days!" Lao Zhu looked at him and said very kindly, with some meaning of persuasion, but his right hand was groping in his trouser pocket for the candy that he seemed to remember was left.

"Let them bomb! Let them bomb to their heart's content, bomb away these scum! Bomb away these waste products! This country of China is really too rotten! We need a thorough sweep! Otherwise, we would rather all die!" Zhang Chang, whose blood was boiling with anger, clenched his fists tightly, looked up at the sky, and roared like a lion, with flames spraying from his eyes.

Lao Zhu didn't find the candy, and wiped his lips with his hand.
