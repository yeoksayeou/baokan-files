### Our Government Suggests Holding a Preliminary Meeting for the Japanese Peace Treaty and Submits a Note to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union

[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao, at a press conference held by the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau on the 19th, announced a note from the Chinese government to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The original text is as follows: "The Chinese government, in view of the urgent need to rebuild peace and normal conditions in the Far East as soon as possible, hereby submits the following proposals to the governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union regarding the convening of a preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty:

A. A preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty should be composed of all member states of the Far Eastern Commission. The meeting should be convened by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China at an early date to draft a peace treaty and decide on matters related to the convening of the final peace conference.

B. All votes at the meeting shall be decided by a majority of all member states of the meeting. The previous requirement was a two-thirds majority, but now it is a simple majority. However, the majority must include the affirmative votes of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, the United States, and China." The proposal is based on the principles governing the organization and procedures of the Far Eastern Commission, which have been unanimously approved by all eleven member states of the Commission. The Chinese government believes that the proposed preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty should not deviate from these principles." The aforementioned proposals were sent by Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh in the same formal note to the foreign ministers of the other three countries. The note was transmitted through our embassies in the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on the 17th of this month, and copies of the note were also sent to the American and British ambassadors to China and the Soviet chargé d'affaires in China.

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] A reporter asked Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao whether China would attend if the preliminary peace conference were convened based on China's proposals, but the Soviet Union still refused to participate. Yeh replied, "Since this question is based on a hypothetical stance of the Soviet Union, I am unable to answer." The Soviet Union's demand that the four major powers draft the treaty differs from China's proposal, indicating that the Chinese government is gradually approaching the position of the United States. Although China still insists on retaining the veto power of the four major powers, it is generally believed that this point will be opposed by the United States.

[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] Foreign Minister Wang met with British Ambassador Steven, American Ambassador Stuart, and Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Derin at the Foreign Ministry at 11:00 a.m. on the 19th, personally delivering our formal note urging their respective countries to consider our position on the preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible.

[United Press, New York, 18th] Howard newspaper reporter LaMoore sent a message from Washington today saying: "China under the rule of the National Government needs foreign aid, largely because Chairman Chiang is forced to engage in a costly war of restoration in the Northeast. The Northeast should belong to the National Government, as President Roosevelt assured him at the Cairo Conference. Although the clause of "full possession" was not listed as part of the Cairo Agreement, there are still officials in Washington today who participated in the treaty, such as congressional reviews of the situation in China, can order them to attend and testify.

### Supervisory Committee Recommends National Government Revise Election Laws

[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] The plenary session of the Supervisory Committee held a symposium at 2:00 p.m. on the 19th to discuss relevant election laws for the Supervisory Committee and submitted recommendations requesting the National Government to revise them. The recommendations are roughly two points: (A) Regarding the establishment of election supervisors, the members of the Supervisory Committee believe that using administrative heads as supervisors for the Supervisory Committee election is extremely susceptible to manipulation. The members elected from this may not be able to exercise their powers fairly, which violates the essence of the Constitution. Moreover, the Supervisory Committee election belongs to the provincial and municipal councils, and the affairs are extremely simple. The councils themselves are sufficient to handle it, and there is no need to establish special supervisors. (B) Regarding the restriction on rapid nomination, the members of the Supervisory Committee believe that the regulations in the Implementation Rules of the Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law, which limit the nomination of provincial and municipal senators to once, make it difficult for candidates to obtain a fair opportunity and hinder the purpose of selecting the virtuous and capable. Therefore, it is proposed to amend it to not limit it to once.

### Mr. Stryker Handles Japanese Reparation Materials to Shanghai for Investigation - We Hope that Dismantled Japanese Power Generation Equipment Will Be Used for Our Use

[Our report] Mr. Stryker, entrusted by the US Department of the Army to investigate the Japanese reparations issue, arrived in Shanghai on a US military special plane from Korea at 6:40 p.m. the night before. After arriving, he was received by the US military headquarters here, and few outsiders knew about it. The Shanghai Office of the Representative Group in Japan received a telegram from the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce, and this morning Zhuang Yuling, accompanied by Zhou Maobai, director of the Chinese Shipyard, and Shi Hongxi, electrical engineer expert of the National Resources Commission, visited Mr. Stryker at the International Hotel for a quarter of an hour. Zhou and Hong told Mr. Stryker that major cities in China, including Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hankou, are experiencing severe power shortages. Currently, if orders are placed with Europe and the United States, it may take two to three years to deliver and build the plant. The performance of Japanese power generation equipment is just right for our country's needs. It is hoped that one or two plants will be moved to China to solve the power panic, especially for increasing the power supply to the coal mining areas to increase their production.

### Our Ships Lost During the War Have Been Requested to be Compensated by the Japanese Side

### Three Parties Have Not Reached Agreement on the Number of Legislative Yuan Candidates - The List of Supervisory Committee Candidates of the Democratic Socialist Party Has Been Decided

[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] The list of Legislative Yuan candidates of the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet been submitted. They are now insisting on the same number of candidates as the Youth Party. Therefore, the prepared list currently remains at 120 names. According to Chiang Yun-tien of the party, the desire to insist on this number is to maintain the role of one-third veto power in the Legislative Yuan in the future, because the total number of Legislative Yuan members is 773, and the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties can obtain 240 seats, which is exactly one-third of the total.

Yu Chia-chu told reporters that the Youth Party has consistently followed a consistent policy for the general election. Therefore, the submission of various candidate lists has been extremely smooth. As for the fact that the Legislative Yuan list has not been submitted so far, it is because the Kuomintang has not yet agreed and responded to these 120 names.

According to reports, the Kuomintang is currently planning to use the proportion of incumbent Democratic Socialist and Youth Party members in the current Legislative Yuan as the proportion of the elected Legislative Yuan members in the next term. According to the current members of the Legislative Yuan, the sum of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties accounts for one-sixth of the total.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding the issue of the Kuomintang incumbents running for the Legislative Yuan, relevant parties had discussed it a few days ago and decided to nominate them. However, if there are two incumbents in one county and the population is over one million, they can be nominated at the same time. But if there are more than three Legislative Yuan members, Sun Fo, President of the Legislative Yuan, will decide.

[Our Report] The Democratic Socialist Party convened a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon to review the list of Supervisory Committee candidates. After the review, it was handed over to Hsu Fu-lin to take to Nanjing last night.

[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] The Youth Party submitted a list of 31 Supervisory Committee candidates. As well as a principle of one province and one city.

### Fire at Pingyanqing Building, Election Site Destroyed

The Files Are Safe, and the General Election Will Proceed as Usual

[Our Beijing Office, 19th] On the eve of the Beijing general election, the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan election offices were suddenly destroyed by fire. Fortunately, the important files were all transported out of danger, and the Beijing National Assembly election on the 21st can still proceed as usual. The Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau is located in Zhongnanhai, and its Household Affairs Section and the temporarily established National Assembly and Legislative Yuan election offices are located in the Yanqing Building behind Huai Ren Hall. Today, the bureau originally scheduled to host a press conference at 3:00 p.m. to report on the preparations for the National Assembly election. Unexpectedly, at 3:10 p.m., the electric wires in the gap between the second-floor floor of the west building of Yanqing Building and the ceiling downstairs suddenly caught fire. The fire brigade arrived ten minutes after the fire started, but because the building was entirely wooden and the wind was strong and the water source was insufficient, although they tried their best to put out the fire, the fire was still raging and could not be contained. The east-west corridors of the building and the Fuchang Hall were burned out. Dozens of ballot boxes prepared by the election office for the National Assembly were destroyed by fire. Fortunately, the important files of the National Assembly election were rescued at risk, so it did not affect the 1.6 million household registration cards in Beijing on the 21st, which were all buried in the fire. By 5:00 p.m., the fire had been extinguished, but at the time of publication, the embers were still burning. Huai Ren Hall, which used to host foreign guests during the era of the former Beijing government, was adjacent to the scene and was fortunately not affected by the efforts to block the fire. Mayor He Siyuan personally visited the fire scene.

### Financial Agreement and Customs Plan - China and Hong Kong Are Conducting Negotiations - Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao Answers Reporters' Questions

[Our Nanjing Office, 19th] China and Hong Kong are currently conducting negotiations on two agreements, one is the China-Hong Kong Financial Agreement, and the other is the China-Hong Kong Customs Cooperation Plan, both of which are aimed at various illegal incidents such as smuggling and the black market. This was the answer given by Foreign Vice Minister Yeh Kung-chao at a press conference at 3:30 p.m. on the 19th in response to reporters' questions. Yeh said: Before we announced the new import and export regulations, China and Hong Kong maintained regular contact. Since the announcement of the new foreign exchange policy on August 16, the British government has imposed controls on the pound sterling group, which has affected and stalled the financial agreement. It is now known that the British side believes that the principles are acceptable, but the technical aspects still need to be considered. Secondly, in terms of customs, we have made a proposal, but we have not yet received a counter-proposal from the British side. The British Ambassador had previously stated that he hoped that the British Foreign Office would make a counter-proposal. Yeh also said: Yu Mou of our Ministry of Finance and Luo Jishi of the Central Bank have gone to Hong Kong, but I do not know whether this is related to this matter. Secondly, Yeh replied to the question of the government's handling of Korean residents in China, saying: "Those who want to return to their country will be assisted in returning to their country, otherwise, those who stay in our country will also be given appropriate relief."

### Australian Chamber of Commerce President Publishes Report on Sino-Australian Mutual Tariff Reductions

[Central News Agency, Sydney, 19th] Australian Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Pollard recently published a report on the Geneva Tariff Agreement, which stated: "China has expressed its willingness to reduce tariffs on butter, cheese, milk, grain, sandalwood, and sandalwood powder by 2% to 5%. China's current tariff on brandy has been reduced by 10%. China is also willing to limit the current tariffs on wool, wheat, flour, fats, canned food, railway sleepers, paving stones, raisins, and leather to between 5% and 20%. As a reciprocal gesture, Australia has expressed its willingness to reduce tariffs on all commodities that played an important role in Sino-Australian trade before the war. If this is the case, the main commodities that will be affected are tung oil, bristles, and raw silk, etc. In addition, it has also directly expressed its willingness to make tariff concessions on the following items, namely, dried egg white, dried egg yolk, raw eggs, oil seeds, oil cakes, hair, etc., and rabbit skins, straw hat braids, antimony, firecrackers, etc." The report also stated: "Due to the special nature of China's major export goods to Australia, it is currently difficult to promote China's exports to Australia by appropriately reducing tariffs. However, Sino-Australian trade can achieve mutually beneficial development after the situation in China is relatively normal, so that both countries can benefit."

The Pingjin and Jinzhou Railway Bureaus are currently discussing direct through-train methods. The only difficulty is the time problem, because the Xingfu Valley section outside the customs is being rebuilt, and the train is delayed. It can be connected directly after a solution is found. The bandit eighth and ninth columns in the area west of Jinzhou have not yet moved far away, posing a great threat to transportation.

Various groups in Hebei hope that the Hebei authorities will ensure Baoding.

[Another Telegram] Military sources: The strength of the National Army in Hebei will be strengthened. A certain unit that has been on a long expedition outside the customs has decided to move to Hebei.

The gains and losses of Hsuchow are related to the livelihood of over 50 million people. Without the complete suppression of bandits south of the Yellow River, Hsuchow will have no peace. The defense fortifications are expected to be completed in ten winters. The people should recognize the long-term nature of bandit suppression, and local self-defense forces should be universally strengthened to protect their homes.

The day of their complete annihilation is not far off.

Editorial

### The Still Worrying Korean Problem

Since the Korean question was placed on the agenda of the Second Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the American proposal has held the upper hand. The General Assembly's passage of the resolution on the 15th to establish a United Nations Temporary Commission to supervise the completion of Korean independence was a revision of the American proposal. This commission includes eight member states, and excluding the Ukraine, which refused to participate, will consist of China, India, Syria, Australia, Canada, France, the Philippines, and El Salvador as members. It also stipulates the procedures for Korean independence: 1. Elections to be held no later than March 31, 1948; 2. A National Assembly to be convened as soon as possible after the elections to form a unified government; 3. The government to form its own national army and disband all military units not belonging to the national army; 4. To liaise with the American and Soviet occupation authorities so that the withdrawal of American and Soviet troops can be completed as far as possible within ninety days after the establishment of the government. Based on this decision, the fate of Korea can be considered to have a general outline. The American authorities in Seoul said: After the passage of the UN resolution, the US-Soviet Joint Commission and the Moscow Agreement have come to an end. The Soviet authorities in North Korea said: The UN resolution is illegal and will refuse to allow the UN supervisory group to exercise its functions in Korea. Neutral observers said: Due to the Soviet Union's insistence on its own views, South Korea may form its own country; North Korea, if not annexed by the Soviet Union, will also depend on the Soviet Union for survival. Looking at the trend, the Korean problem still has potential internal and external troubles in the future, and the situation before March next year is still unpredictable.

The Korean problem is one of the disputes that arose after the war, and it is also one of the battlegrounds for strong countries. Why are powerful countries competing for Korea? Geographical factors are naturally greater than economic factors. Korea is a peninsula protruding from the southeast of the Asian continent, like a giant arm extending into the ocean. It was once considered a "land bridge" connecting Japan and borders Korea and Northeast China, located between China, the Soviet Union, and Japan. It has good naval and air force bases. From the perspective of the American military position, if it controls Korea, the positions of Japan and Korea are like "the spokes of a wheel depend on each other"; from the perspective of the Soviet military position, if it controls Korea, the positions of Manchuria and Korea are like "lips and teeth depending on each other". The expansion policies of powerful countries are based on geopolitics, and geopolitics determines the importance of Korea's political position. Powerful countries naturally cannot let go of Korea, and thus Korea's tragedy began. The reason why there is a problem with Korea after the war, to be honest, is that the Cairo, Potsdam, Yalta, and subsequent Moscow conferences and secret diplomacy created a big mistake. The Cairo Conference made a strong guarantee for Korean independence, but this independent freedom was limited by a "considerable period of time". Because Korean independence still needed a "considerable period of time", the Potsdam Conference decided to use the 38th parallel as the boundary, with the United States and the Soviet Union occupying the north and south respectively; therefore, at the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Roosevelt accepted the Soviet Union's demand to restore all the rights looted during the Tsarist Russian era, harming the integrity and survival of Korea; therefore, the Moscow Agreement in December 1945 decided on a five-year trusteeship plan for Korea and established a US-Soviet Joint Commission to supervise Korea. This series of mistakes caused subsequent disputes between powerful countries, turning the independence and freedom that the Korean people had longed for for many years into an unbelievable tragedy.

The Korean people are originally an amiable and kind nation; in the past, in order to oppose Japanese rule, there was no distinction between north and south, and no distinction between parties, everyone was united as a nation. Since Japan's surrender, new Korean parties have been established one after another, and under the divided occupation of the American and Soviet armies, two major forces have formed, with strict barriers and sharp opposition. Especially in North Korea, the training of a large number of troops is constantly accumulating and threatening a red coup at any time. Therefore, South Korea does not hesitate to adopt economic blockades, cut off cargo sources, and do not communicate with each other. Internal ideological opposition and economic opposition are becoming increasingly serious, and the Korean people have not been able to rise up and do something, which is really a great tragedy for the nation. At this UN conference, the Soviet Union advocated withdrawing troops and then holding elections, while the United States deeply feared that a red coup would occur after the withdrawal of troops, making Korea an Asian Hungary. Therefore, the United States proposed to first establish a democratically elected government, and then withdraw its troops after the national army disbanded its armed forces; the Soviet Union said that elections under the occupation of foreign troops seemed unfair. The Soviet Union and the United States fought each other, and both had their reasons; as a result of not yielding to each other, the American proposal prevailed. However, the Soviet bloc was defeated by a minority, which does not mean that the Soviet Union has made concessions on the Korean issue; in fact, the Soviet Union will be more active in Korea, and it is still the Koreans who are suffering.

The establishment of the UN plan is a spiritual victory for the United States. The American military announced that the US-Soviet Joint Commission and the Moscow Agreement have come to an end, which shows that the United States will take practical and effective actions to destroy the decisions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945. Legally, the UN plan replaces the five-year trusteeship plan, and the United Nations Temporary Commission replaces the US-Soviet Joint Commission. From the perspective of Korea's future independence, the cancellation of the five-year trusteeship decision is beneficial to Korea; the United Nations Committee is easier to accept the will of the Korean people than the US-Soviet Joint Commission. Therefore, this plan is naturally more reasonable than the Moscow Agreement, and it is produced through the public will of the United Nations, which is more legitimate than the secret diplomatic approach. What is regrettable is that the establishment of this plan has not been coordinated and understood by the United States and the Soviet Union, especially the non-cooperative attitude of the Soviet bloc, which claims that the minority cannot obey the majority, will inevitably increase many difficulties for the Joint Committee. Looking at the news from Moscow in recent days, the actions of North Korea and the new crisis in Korea are growing, and the separation of north and south is difficult to avoid. Before March next year, whether North and South Korea can coordinate and rise up to unite and strive for national self-determination is a major key to the future of Korean independence and unification.

### Archbishop Yu Pin's Remarks

(Continued from page one) He stated, "I am a private citizen, but I am the editor of six newspapers and the owner of two radio stations, so I know a thing or two about public opinion. Today in China, we have a very difficult situation. Our war is not one of propaganda or writing, but a large-scale armed conflict. China currently has 20,000 fully armed communists. We fought against Japanese imperialism for ten years, so our economic situation is extremely poor. Today, China is not only fighting against the communists, but also struggling against a difficult economy." He called President Truman's message to Congress on Monday "very exciting."

[United Press Washington, 18th] Archbishop Yu Pin told reporters on the 18th that China needs economic assistance to curb inflation, which is what the United States means by providing financial aid to China. When asked by reporters how much financial aid China needs, he said he did not know. He also said that he is not an official of the Chinese government and has no right to discuss economic aid to China with President Truman, but he would like to meet with the President again because he had previously had his first meeting with the President in San Francisco.

### Reasons for Dismissal of Charges in the Case of Kuo Shun and Others Published

[Our Correspondent in Soochow, 19th] The case of Kuo Shun, General Manager of the Shanghai Wing On Textile Company, and managers Kuo Lin-shuang, Kuo Ti-huo, Wen Tuan-chiu, etc., being accused of being traitors was dismissed by the Soochow High Procuratorate yesterday. The reasons are now published as follows: Even if the defendants in this case are guilty of the fourth clause of the first item of Article 2 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, as alleged by the plaintiff, and referring to the order of the Judicial Yuan, the plaintiff is not a direct victim, and his report was made after the end of 1946, so it can be waived. Moreover, according to the defendants' defense, although they participated in the Japanese Yufeng Co., Ltd., it was an act of unavoidable resistance under violence, and they did not contribute funds to the enemy. After the victory, the Kiangsu-Chekiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau investigated and found that there was no act of providing funds to the enemy, so the machinery and equipment of the two factories were returned. Moreover, it was found that the defendant Kuo Shun had assisted military intelligence personnel during the war and had made meritorious contributions. The Ministry of Justice had transferred it to the Chairman's handwritten order for protection. In summary, the defendant is clearly not guilty of treason and should be dismissed.

### The Price of Capturing Shihchiachuang Was 30,000 Casualties for the Bandits

Those Who Escaped from Shihchiachuang Tell the Truth

[Our Correspondent in Peiping, 19th] A guest escaped from Shihchiachuang the day after it fell and arrived in Peiping last night.

### Marshall clarifies US foreign policy, seeking to restore European prosperity, transform Germany, and prevent the resurgence of aggression

[Reuters, Chicago, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall delivered a speech to the Foreign Relations Association here today, accusing the Soviet Union of engaging in the most shameless and insulting propaganda. He said that the time has come to stop such provocative actions. Marshall will leave for London in two days to attend the Foreign Ministers' Conference. His speech can reveal his attitude at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He said, "I will participate in this meeting with an open mind and will do my best to find a perfect foundation for agreement. No matter how provocative it is, I will avoid making statements that only serve propaganda purposes. In the entire issue of rebuilding European stability, the German issue is the most acute, but we must be prudent so that the rebuilt Germany will not threaten the European economy again. There is no doubt that Germany must be completely disarmed and demilitarized, but the US proposal to conclude a four-power 40-year treaty to monitor Germany's non-aggression still exists. In addition, we must also ensure that future German governments do not use Germany's economic power as a weapon to promote purely German policies. The answer to this question is primarily related to the future mission of the Ruhr region. The United States believes that guarantees must be established to ensure that the resources and industrial power of the Ruhr region are not controlled solely by any future German government, but can be used to promote the welfare of the entire Europe. After establishing appropriate guarantees, a temporary central authority can be established in a federal Germany, and finally the provisions of the peace treaty can be drafted. We will seek progress along these lines at the London Conference." Marshall then talked about the diplomatic issues facing the United States, saying, "The United States is a part of European civilization. The United States and the United Kingdom are sincerely striving for the recovery of Europe. Unfortunately, one of the three major powers that made significant contributions in the World War is not sharing this task with us. Its motives are still unclear, but its actions are prolonging the current state of dissatisfaction indefinitely. The differences of opinion between the United States and the Soviet Union mostly stem from this, that is, the different goals held for the future of Europe, not due to direct conflicts of interest between the two countries. We believe that to make Europe strong again, this issue must be resolved first, and then the disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union in the European part will inevitably be reduced."

### Soviet Union deliberately distorts propaganda, hoping to stop it in time

Marshall continued to talk about the motives of US foreign policy and foreign aid programs, accusing Soviet officials and Communist parties in various places of intensifying the movement and distorting the US foreign policy intentions. He said, "These people who are obstructing the revival accuse the United States of having imperialist goals, aggressive intentions, and even wanting to provoke a third world war. I want to solemnly declare that these accusations have no truth whatsoever. We have not annexed land, and although we have the most powerful military and military resources, we have not used them to seize political or economic privileges. Since the end of the war, the United States and the United Kingdom have automatically reduced their sovereign areas in various parts of the world and given dependent nations independence and a position in the United Nations."

Marshall continued, "Although there are still undetermined factors in the huge and complex Marshall Plan for European aid, we deeply understand that the danger of not taking risks to try to revive Europe and taking active action is even greater. As for the Marshall Plan, it is by no means, as rumored, to sell US surplus goods to prevent a US economic panic. This peculiar accusation is extremely harsh to the European people who are eager for necessities of life and the American people who hold money waiting to buy goods imported to Europe. This is the atmosphere of propaganda. I hope that the problems caused by propaganda between the United States and the Soviet Union can be cleared up before the Foreign Ministers' Conference is held. At the beginning of the end of the war, the American people had a very high admiration for the Soviet people, the army, and their leaders, but now this attitude has completely changed. Many provocative actions by the Soviet government have not had any other obvious goals. I have tried to find explanations in the historical nature of the Soviet government, but I still don't understand why the Soviet government deliberately aroused hatred in other parties. The American people have been patient for a long time, but now they have reached the point where they cannot bear it any longer and are forced into a state of active indignation. I sincerely hope that the Soviet Union can stop these provocative measures." Marshall finally said, "I am not pessimistic about the progress in this session of the General Assembly. Although the United Nations organization has undergone severe struggles, I believe that its strength has not been seriously lost."

### US and Soviet Union have not reached an agreement on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference

[Reuters, London, 18th] When the Foreign Ministers' Conference meets on the 25th of this month, the foreign ministers' representatives will submit two agendas, one proposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and one proposed by the Soviet Union. The content and order of the former are as follows: 1. Austrian Treaty; 2. German Economic Principles; 3. German Political Organization; 4. Four-Power Treaty for Monitoring German Disarmament; 5. German Borders; 6. Procedures for Preparing a Treaty with Germany. The Soviet representative Smirnov stated that the four representatives only need to report to the Foreign Ministers' Conference that they have agreed to discuss the aforementioned items 1, 2, 3, and 6, but this does not mean that these items must be adopted.

### US and Soviet Foreign Ministers may discuss the procedures for the Japanese Peace Conference outside the meeting, and will formally discuss the veto issue

[United Press, Success Lake, 18th] Authoritative sources told United Press today that the United States hopes to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the procedures for holding the Japanese Peace Conference at the London Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, due to China's non-participation in the Foreign Ministers' Conference, this issue cannot be included in the agenda, but it is reported that Secretary of State Marshall will hold formal talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to strongly urge the Soviet Union to abandon the veto power over the resolutions of the Peace Conference. However, well-informed observers believe that this is impossible to achieve. It is reported that US officials are not particularly pessimistic. The US view on this issue is said to be based on the following factors:

The United Nations is unwilling to see the Soviet Union boycott the passage of the Balkan Investigation Country, the Small General Assembly, and the Korean Investigation Team. The past is a lesson. If the United States issues invitations to convene a Peace Conference without the Soviet Union's consent to participate, it will no longer be a groundbreaking move. The Soviet Union is already facing this situation. The United States considers China as obviously showing signs of agreeing with Wu Guo's position. It is believed that the Soviet Union cannot not attend the Peace Conference forever. If the United States issues invitations directly in China several times later, the Soviet Union will finally be asked to accept them. In this regard, the United States trusts the unwavering support of the United Kingdom. The United States was initially hesitant about this move, fearing that the Soviet Union would boycott the meeting and break up, but according to recent developments, the United States believes that this matter is only a small matter in the general split between Washington and Moscow. In any case, the invitations to the Japanese Peace Conference will not be issued before Marshall and Molotov's successes or failures at the London Conference.

### Princess Elizabeth's wedding today, people wait overnight to see the grand ceremony

[United Press, London, 19th] Today is the eve of the wedding of Crown Princess Elizabeth, and the city is covered in dark clouds and rain. The princess rose at dawn and was busy preparing. According to unofficial sources, the bridegroom, Captain Mountbatten, is expected to be granted the title of Duke of Clarence or Duke of Edinburgh by the King. At the same time, experienced police officers from the police station have completed the security network, and the same measures have been taken from Buckingham Palace to Waterloo Station, the starting point of the honeymoon trip, and the Guangdi Building near Yuen Mengxi, Hampshire, the end point. Thousands of citizens began to gather in the streets tonight, preempting the foremost position behind the police officers and patiently waiting for the passing of the ceremonial guard tomorrow. In a few private buildings near the government agencies, there were even people buying "window rights" to compete for the appearance of the new couple.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The wedding dress worn by Princess Elizabeth was made of white silk with a veil of fifteen feet long. The embroidery on the dress was meticulously completed by 300 female workers in two weeks. When they worked, they wore cotton paper sleeves and had to wash their hands every half an hour to avoid staining the dress. Because the bridegroom is very tall, the princess will wear higher heels than usual. After the wedding, her gifts will be stored in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

### Amidst the surging national strike in France, Blum tries to form a new cabinet, the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party officially announces

[United Press, Paris, 19th] The Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Mollet, announced at a luncheon of the Anglo-American Press Association today that, due to the surging strike instigated by the Communist Party, former Prime Minister Blum has agreed to try to form a new cabinet and will be completed in the next few days. France is currently divided into two factions. If a civil war breaks out, the situation will be as bad as in Spain. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate forces to resist the Communist Party and de Gaulle's People's Renaissance Party. The Blum Cabinet is the last chance for France to retain freedom, peace, and democratic elements and negotiate with the United States.

### The Northern Legislative Council drafts a provisional constitution with implied hostility to the South Korean government

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] The North Korean People's Assembly, a legislative body formed by the North Korean People's Government to confront the South Korean government, continued to hold meetings today, chaired by Speaker Kim Doo-bong, to discuss the speaker's report on the drafting of a provisional constitution. Representative Kim Jeong-ju said in his speech that the fact that the Korean Provisional Constitution does not use the word "North" is of great significance. This is a declaration of war on the "reactionary elements" in South Korea, which will sweep away the reactionary style of the South Korean transitional legislative assembly. In the afternoon meeting, it was decided to draft the Korean Provisional Constitution and elect the members of the Constitution Drafting Committee. Kim Doo-bong was elected as the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and Kim Il-sung Mang Ji-ju Choi Kyung-deok and 31 others were elected as members. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 19th] The North Korean legislative body was established on the 18th. 230 people's representatives from each province participated in the ceremony. Eleven people from the local area and the Standing Committee of the People's Committee also attended the meeting.

### China supports US proposal on veto issue

Wei Jun refutes Soviet group's slander

[Our report] New York Broadcasting on the 19th: Success Lake News, the UN Political Committee met today to discuss the veto issue. Chinese representative Gu Weijun delivered a speech, supporting the US position and agreeing to submit the issue to the "Small General Assembly" for discussion. He refuted the statement by Ukrainian representative Manuilsky that China is the incarnation of the United States. He said that China's votes on any issue are based on a fair position as the standard of judgment, and the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are not enough to influence our attitude. The situation is obviously different in Ukraine. If one country in the Yugoslav group votes in one way, the other countries in the group will inevitably follow suit. Although this is Ukraine's business and has nothing to do with us, it is clearly wrong for Ukraine to accuse China of relying on the opinions of other countries. Gu reiterated his support for the US proposal, and strongly stated that the use of the veto power has shattered the hopes of the world.

At the same time, AFL-CIO Chairman Green delivered a radio speech last night, saying that the labor community will unanimously oppose price and wage controls unless they are used as a last resort during a national emergency.

### US Navy successfully tests defense against atomic bomb radiation

[United Press, Success Lake, 18th] People well-informed in the United Kingdom and the United States told United Press today that the United Kingdom and the United States will not recognize the new government of Siam until Luang Phibuns leaves the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Army. At the same time, authoritative sources revealed that Prince Swatievat, acting head of the Siamese delegation to the United Nations, has telegraphed Bangkok to urge the new government of Apaiwong and the exiled government of Prime Minister Phraya Phahon to negotiate and reconcile.

The military also stated that the conspiracy to assassinate the late king was intended to change the monarchy to a republic, but no concrete evidence has been presented yet.

[United Press, Zurich, 18th] King Bhumibol of Thailand is currently studying in Switzerland and lives in a villa on the north bank of Lake Geneva.

[Our report] The police station's economic section received a secret report yesterday, saying that Ruiryoutian Food Store at 514 Foch Road, had hoarded a large number of cloth.

### The Literary Movement Association Announces the Meeting; Speaker Pan Delivers a Speech Explaining "The Meaning of Universal Suffrage"

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the Central Cultural Movement Committee organized "Mr. Pan Gongzhan's Campaign Rally for National Assembly Representatives." It was held yesterday from 5 PM to 8 PM at the Cultural Center, hosting cultural figures from the city, as well as district representatives and neighborhood heads from Hongkou and North Sichuan Road areas. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Chu Wenren, Deputy Director of the Association. Speaker Pan attended and delivered a speech titled "The Meaning of Universal Suffrage," stating in brief: The Republic of China has been established for thirty-six years, but the implementation of constitutional governance will begin with this year's upcoming elections for National Assembly Representatives and legislators. The Kuomintang's one-party tutelage will thus be formally declared ended, and

Power Returned to the People

The National Assembly Representatives and legislators elected by the people will be the figures who represent the people in managing state affairs in the future. Mr. Pan also said: The National Assembly Representatives have two tasks: first, to represent the people in safeguarding the Constitution, and second, to represent the people in electing the President. The method is similar to a company's shareholders electing a group of directors to control the company's major policies, and then the board of directors electing a general manager to implement the company's

All operations. Therefore, all members of our Kuomintang and compatriots who believe in the Three Principles of the People, if they want to protect our Three Principles of the People Constitution and promote its full benefits, should cherish their right to vote, and use conscience and reason to judge who is the ideal person who can take on this responsibility to be our representative. He continued that the current voting method is anonymous, which is an absolutely democratic and free method, but citizens should note that they cannot therefore give up voting, nor can they arbitrarily evade it, because abandoning or evading it, although not a crime in law,

Carries a responsibility in conscience. In other words, if all voters have the mentality of abandoning or evading voting, then what is there to talk about democracy, and how can constitutional governance be implemented? I am a member of the Kuomintang and also a candidate nominated by the Kuomintang. If you believe in the Kuomintang and think highly of me among the candidates nominated by the Kuomintang, then vote for me, but this is still your own freedom.

After Speaker Pan finished his speech, the film "Happiness Rhapsody" was screened to entertain the guests. It was also learned that Speaker Pan attended campaign speeches in various locations all day yesterday, totaling six places. The Tianchan Stage had invited Mr. Pan to give a speech last night, but Mr. Pan could not attend due to taking a night train to Jinan.

All Sectors Support Mr. Pan

Since Speaker Pan was nominated as a candidate for National Assembly Representative in this city, various sectors have expressed their support: The Shanghai branch of the National Chengchi University Alumni Association held an extraordinary meeting yesterday, unanimously resolving to support Instructor Pan Gongzhan as a National Assembly Representative.

Li Fangzheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Writers Association's Literary Lecture Alumni Association, said that this time Mr. Pan is a candidate for National Assembly Representative in this city, and our cultural and educational circles and students above the specialist level should unanimously vote in support.

The presidium consisted of Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Feng Youzhen, Cao Jun, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Feicheng, Wan Molin, and Yu Wen.

Then, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating in brief: The law stipulates that the people have the freedom to exercise the four rights of election, initiative, recall, and referendum. This general election is the beginning of the people's exercise of the four rights. He wished the people success in using their voting rights in this election, success in implementing constitutional governance, and success in the Three Principles of the People. Afterwards, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, hoping that citizens would vote enthusiastically. There are currently three million voters in this city. If the number of votes cast is only 400,000, it will become a joke. This matter concerns our country's national dignity. He hoped that all citizens would use their voting rights as much as possible to strive for international national dignity and seek to improve the level of democracy. Finally, Xu Jiguang, Liu Weichi, and others delivered speeches before the meeting adjourned.

### Police Bureau Investigation Report States: Seeing a Hand Signal from the Window, Xu Jizhuang's Wife and Others Were Investigated in Court Yesterday

[Report from our Newspaper] Xu Jinshanru, wife of former Postal Remittance Bureau Director Xu Jizhuang, Cheng Tianru, director of Zhenye Bank, and Cao Mingzhi, Xu's chauffeur, were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on the charge of "concealing a criminal" after being arrested by the police bureau.

Shortly after, Cao drove the empty car back to the address. Police bureau personnel searched the premises but could not find Xu Jizhuang. They therefore believed that Xu's wife and others had concealed a criminal and facilitated his escape, so they arrested everyone present. During the interrogation by Prosecutor Yu, Xu's wife and others all claimed that they did not know Xu's whereabouts. They denied knowing about the escape. The interrogation lasted from 3 PM to 8:30 PM, and the three defendants were still remanded in custody.

### Heroes Have No Place to Use Their Skills; Fine Horses Sigh with Regret. They Are Extremely Willing to Be of Service and Repay Their Master by Doing Their Best for Refugees

[Special Report from our Newspaper] Ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai, it's been almost three years since we last met. Thank you for not forgetting us, and for mentioning us again at this time. When we first heard that someone had proposed "restoring horse racing" in the City Council, we thought: Heroes can finally have a place to use their skills again! We were so happy that our tails were wagging. But then they said that our racing was gambling in nature, so it was dropped as a topic, leaving us with nothing but empty joy and still unable to come out. This time, we hear that we're being brought up again for the sake of refugee relief. We hope that this time it can finally become a reality. We've been idle and doing nothing for so many years, we really feel like we're growing fat from disuse! Also, seeing those poor refugees, we're quite willing to put our four hooves to work.

### Past Glory, But Now Just a Case

We recall the glory days before the war, and can't help but sigh. At that time, we had more than five hundred partners. How fun it was to be together, neighing and calling! Our old home was originally in Mongolia. After the master bought us, he printed the year on our backs. So as long as you look, you can know which year we came to Shanghai. But we can't just be filling space. Our height, measured from the top of the mane to the back of the front leg, has to be between twelve feet three inches and thirteen feet three inches to qualify for competition. Please don't be surprised, no horse twelve feet tall has ever been discovered in the world. What is called a foot here is not a real foot, but what is called a Hand in English, that is, the distance from the thumb to the little finger, which is equal to four inches. So, to be precise, our standard height is twelve "hands" three inches to thirteen "hands" three inches. It's just that people are used to saying feet.

### Training Soldiers for a Thousand Days, Using Them for One

After meeting the height requirements, we can't just participate in the competition right away. We also have to put in a lot of hard work to practice. Every morning, the groom leads us to the racecourse, and the heroic jockey rides us for half an hour or an hour, running until we're sweating and our muscles are trained. On the one hand, we eat good things, we eat barley, we eat bran. The master can be said to be taking care of us in every possible way. This is nothing more than wanting to "train soldiers for a thousand days, use them for one."

When the race comes, there are regulations for the weight we carry on our bodies. Those of us who are thirteen "hands" tall must carry no less than one hundred and fifty-two pounds. If our jockey weighs only one hundred and fifty pounds, he has to add two pounds of lead. Those of us who are twelve "hands" three inches tall must carry no less than one hundred and forty-nine pounds, those who are thirteen "hands" one inch tall must carry no less than one hundred and fifty-five pounds, and those who are thirteen "hands" three inches tall must carry no less than one hundred and sixty-one pounds. This way, our chances are equal, and we run without hesitation. Whoever wins the championship, the master of that horse will be rewarded. This is the time for us to repay the kindness of our masters.

### Hoping to Return to the Racecourse One Day

In addition to the races where tickets are sold, our masters sometimes hold purely competitive "paper hunting races." That's really fun. The so-called paper hunting race usually takes place in the suburbs. Someone first scatters confetti between the starting and ending points, and we follow the trail of confetti. Sometimes we need to jump over small streams, sometimes we need to cross bamboo fences, and sometimes the person scattering the paper deliberately sets up a trap, and we have to run the wrong way. I remember once we trampled on a morning field, which almost caused a conflict. In the end, our master compensated for it, and it was also recorded in the newspaper.

Horse races have been banned in the past two years, and our fate has been miserable. Many partners have been sold by their masters, "falling" to pulling horse carts or being ridden for fun. Fortunately, we are one of the "famous horses." Our master is reluctant to abandon us, and still rides us to the racecourse or circles around the Great West Road every morning. But even so, our food costs our master two or three million yuan a month. We're always unhappy in our hearts, and always hope that one day we can return to the racecourse and win a prize for our master, and get some glory.

But, on the other hand, our hope for the reopening of horse racing is not entirely for ourselves. We also want to do our best for the refugees! Look, the Siberian cold current has already arrived!

### Provisional Measures for Rickshaw Rental Rights; Adjusted Every Three Months

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai City Rickshaw and Tricycle Rental Review Committee held its first meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, chaired by Huang Changhan, Section Chief of the Labor Welfare Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. Due to time constraints, only the rickshaw rental issue was discussed. Provisional measures were decided, and the current rental rate will be set at a reasonable standard based on the current amount. It will then be adjusted every three months based on prices. In addition, regulations on rental quality and measures to crack down on black market rentals were stipulated. For the first instance of black market rentals, a fine of three times the excess amount will be imposed. For the second instance, a fine of ten times the excess amount will be imposed. For the third instance, the license will be revoked.

### Imitating the Trademark of Diederichsen & Co.; The Enemy Assets Clearance Office Requests Investigation

[Report from our Newspaper] Yan Shouheng, the owner of the Zhida Printing Factory at No. 43, Lane 546, Xinzha Road, imitated the trademark paper of Diederichsen & Co., reaching more than 10,000 reams. Tian, a broker, sold the counterfeit trademarks to Xin Kang, Zhou Ji, Yong Yi, Xin Tai, Tai Kang, and other businesses, and affixed them to indigo-dyed cloth for use. This was previously cracked down by the Garrison Headquarters. The Enemy and Puppet Assets Clearance Office of the Central Trust Bureau stated that the trademark had been announced in newspapers as prohibited for daily use. They sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, requesting that suspects Yan Shouheng and Xu Nanhua be investigated and retaining the civil suit portion, requesting compensation for losses.

### Strange Incident! Running Out of the House with a Knife for No Reason; Arrested and Confessed to Killing His Wife and Abandoning the Body

[Report from our Newspaper] Zhang Qien, 51, from Nantong, residing at No. 11 Yude Lane, Yunnan Road. Yesterday at around 10 AM, his nephew Zhang Guanqing (29 years old) came, and after a few words of conversation, Guanqing suddenly grabbed a kitchen knife and ran outside like he was insane. Qien did not understand the reason and rushed out to chase after him. At the intersection of Yunnan Road and Beihai Road, he restrained him, called the police, and brought him to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau. After interrogation, according to his confession, at around 5 AM on April 9, he stabbed his wife Zhang Xu Yinge in the chest, neck, and head with a knife in the wilderness of South Wharf, Pudong, killing her and abandoning the body by the roadside before fleeing. As for the reason for killing his wife, it was because she often didn't come home and had numerous lovers outside. The most obvious was having an affair with his younger uncle Zhang Taotao, acting like husband and wife. Taotao is now a self-employed tricycle driver serving as the assistant manager of the Siming Bank. Also, his brother-in-law Zhou Xiaoqing, who works as an employee of the bank, colluded to hide Yinge for about three months. After questioning them, he was beaten, and therefore held a deep grudge. So after finding her, he lured her to Pudong and committed this heinous act.

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the District Procuratorate indicted Zhang Chunfan for the crime of instigating suicide, the District Court scheduled the trial to begin on the 27th.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Pengnian, known as "Cowhide Candy," and Lu Ruizhang from Xiaowuxi, Wang Zhang and Shang, Wang Zhizhang, who are known as the thirty-six notorious gang leaders in the Suzhou Creek area, are notorious in the Suzhou Creek area.

### Single Weak Woman Meets Thugs on the Journey: Stalked from Hangzhou to Shanghai

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, a stalking case involving a group of thugs targeting a lone young woman occurred on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Gao Meihua, a young woman from Shanghai, lived with her uncle at 44, Lane 121, North Chengdu Road. The day before yesterday, she went from Shanghai to Hangzhou to visit friends and seek a living. However, after arriving in Hangzhou, she learned that her friend had already moved elsewhere. She spent the night in a small hotel near the station, planning to return to Shanghai by train the next day. While Gao was sleeping soundly in the middle of the night, she was suddenly awakened by the sound of the ceiling board being struck and multiple people whispering. When she saw the floorboard lifting up, several pairs of thieving eyes were frequently peering at her. Gao was shocked and quickly pretended to have a stomachache, waking up the tea boy to send boiling water and taking the opportunity to get dressed. She rushed to the station, hastily leaving her mask bag in the hotel. She then saw several thugs also following and teasing her. As she was alone, she did not dare to speak out. She waited until 6:10 and took train 40 to Shanghai. At that time, one of the thugs was also on the train, following her closely. When the train arrived at the North Station yesterday afternoon, Gao quickly got off the train and went to the Chief Station Master's office to ask for protection. Her expression was quite flustered. After the station staff asked about the reason, they ordered the police to arrest the thugs, but nothing was achieved.

### Three Thousand Miles in Northern Jiangsu: The People's Voices - The People Withdraw South with the Garrison

### The People Withdraw South with the Garrison

Due to the adjustment of the overall strategy, the military authorities are unwilling to drag a large force for the sake of one city. On October 1st, the authorities decided to withdraw the garrison from Yancheng. At 1:00 AM in the deep night, the county government notified all the people in the city to prepare for withdrawal. Except for the elderly, weak, women, and children, everyone in the city gathered at dawn and were organized by County Magistrate Wu Wenchun to withdraw south with the garrison. Because they were unwilling to be oppressed and ravaged by the bandits, this group of more than 300,000 unfortunate people, unafraid of the attacks of hunger and cold, fled to the areas controlled by the National Army, although the government did not have a proper arrangement or relief for them.

When the reporter arrived in Dongtai, it was the third day after the retreat from Yancheng. The reporter saw the situation where the refugees were selling the only relief items they received - clothes from the Su-Ning Sub-district Office - at a low price to raise travel expenses, which was truly heartbreaking.

### Cunningly Move Towards Defense Gaps

Currently, there is a noteworthy problem in the hearts of the troops and the people. Now the National Army is adopting mobile warfare with the aim of defeating the main force of the bandits. In the current situation of insufficient troop allocation, we should believe and understand that a unit cannot stay for long after capturing a stronghold. In the short term, everything is normal in the local area, but the problem becomes serious after the National Army is transferred away. With the old trick of wandering bandits, they specialize in drilling into the gaps. When he discovers that the defense here is weak and there are no regular troops stationed, he will immediately concentrate his forces to sneak attack. After the capture, according to their terror policy, anyone who has done anything for the National Army or the government, or even spoken to government personnel once, will be regarded as a reactionary and killed without mercy. Although the Huaihai Pacification Zone stipulates that the self-defense forces of a district or township should send women and children to safe areas when necessary to retreat and complete the "clearing the fields," how can they take care of it when the situation is tense? Therefore, the reporter heard many people say: If the National Army wants to advance, it must stay for a long time. Otherwise, for the sake of the people, it is better not to advance. The fact is indeed the case, but how can it be done? However, it must be said that, up to now, the speaker has never heard anyone in the local area say that they do not want the National Army to advance to their hometowns. They believe that any situation under government control is tens of thousands of times better than when the bandits occupy it. Therefore, as soon as they hear that the National Army is advancing, the local people immediately begin to provide information and assist in transportation and other work.

Now the reporter wants to turn his pen and talk about the people who were coerced and lured into joining the bandit groups.

### Current Re-education Work

To open a new path for some ignorant and uneducated people who have been lured or coerced into joining the bandit groups, each county has established re-education centers, which are responsible for handling the re-education work after self-renewal.

The methods of the Communist bandits are vicious and ruthless. In order to succeed in their "cause" and strive to win over the broad masses, they do not hesitate to use any means to drive the people and lure the people to plunge into their abyss of sin. However, everyone has a sense of right and wrong. Coercion and deception can only be effective for a while. As long as people discover their sins, they will immediately return to the embrace of the government. Of course, there are very few exceptions.

There is an English proverb: "East, west, home is best." I have asked too many people who are undergoing re-education, and their answers are all the same for their families and children.

Obviously, in the current re-education work, there is a deep contradiction. That is, the psychology of mutual hatred between the people who have not joined the bandits and the people who have joined the bandits has not been completely eliminated. Therefore, there are many people who have joined the bandits whose hearts have already begun to regret their decisions, but they do not dare to rush to the embrace of the government.

On the other hand, the re-education work is a mess in many places. Due to the extortion and intimidation of the village chiefs, their terror is deepened. A self-reformed person, who wants to receive the "re-education" washing, cannot buy through the village chief, you want to forget about it. Because generally people's psychology, get through the government re-education, on his own personality, there will be one more layer of protection. Even some people in general, see the family's people delivered to the county to get re-education, think as if it is going to jail, the whole family is frightened and crying. In fact, some of the counties' re-education centers are similar to prisons.

In the Guanyun County Re-education Center a few months ago, many tragedies were created due to insufficient "prisoner rations." Also, due to the misconduct of the person in charge, the actual number of people did not match the roster at all. Some people had "released on bail" noted under Zhang San's name, but the person who was released was not Zhang San, but Li Si. After County Magistrate Zheng Senqi took over, he inquired in detail and immediately released those with lighter offenses. Before releasing them, he also talked to them individually, telling them: Those who bailed you out are all township chiefs, they sympathize with you very much, and they hope that you will assist them more in their work after you come out. He also introduced them to the local district chiefs. This can eliminate their alienation from the township chiefs and can also eliminate their hatred for the township chiefs. This fact is enough to show that the re-education center not only cannot do the re-education work, but also cannot do it well like a prison. Among the counties I have seen, Gaoyou's re-education center is the best. Several phases have been completed, and after the re-education is completed, they are assisted in changing jobs. The self-reformed people who are undergoing re-education in Gaoyou are all very fat, which shows that their nutrition is very good. County Magistrate Zhang Guanqiu asked them: "Have you eaten your fill?" "Yes!" A burst of happy cheers.

In addition, there is an undeniable fact that some people who are obsessed with their delusion have been too deeply anesthetized by the bandit army and their minds can no longer be changed. Many counties have discovered that people who have undergone self-examination or re-education still secretly communicate with the bandits and specialize in providing the bandit army with intelligence. For this, the government should resolutely deal with it, so that the people can be warned that there is no me with bandits, and there are no bandits with me. Otherwise, today they are obedient people; and when they arrive in the bandit army camp, struggle, purge... and they will do everything. In this way, it is enough to create a fluke mentality among the general public. They see through the government's weakness of being lenient, and they might as well be arrested and then start a new life. Therefore, our request to the government today is: Punish the murderers according to the circumstances, and be lenient to a limited extent. (Special reporter Ling Songshou)

### Notarized Marriage to be Implemented Soon in Changshu

[Our Newspaper Changshu, 18th] This District Court has specially set up a notary office to facilitate the public in handling notary affairs. Recently, it received a petition, the content of which is a request for notarized marriage. The male protagonist is Chu Mingde, from Fugang, and the female lead is Lu Ruizhen, from Xieqiao. The above request is still a first in this county. The content of the petition is euphemistic and readable; the original is as follows: "For the sake of our affection, we wish to be husband and wife, and jointly request that the marriage be notarized, and we will comply with the instructions after approval. The petitioners live in the same village, and are also related to each other. Although we have never met before, we have known each other for a long time. After the introduction of Tan Shuliang and Feng Guoxiang, we have been in contact from time to time, and we are truly in love and have sworn an oath of love. The male is a widower, and has no wife. The female is unmarried, and is waiting to be married. We could have held a wedding with a matchmaker, but there is a hidden reason that is difficult to say. The petitioner Mingde runs a shop, and can barely support himself. Ruizhen's family has an old mother, who is instigated by others and does not allow her freedom. Therefore, relatives are silent, and neighbors are watching. It is true that the autonomy of marriage has not been implemented in the countryside, and growing old in years is deeply worrying. There is no group wedding here at this time. If we fly away to get married in another place, not only is our ability limited, but we are afraid of being mistaken for eloping. We humbly believe that notarized marriage seems to be personally ordained by law, and we have heard that it has been realized in other counties. After consultation, we jointly submit a petition for implementation. As for the amount of fees to be paid, what items to be prepared, and what procedures to be followed, we earnestly request instructions and will comply, and we are deeply grateful." It is learned that the above petition has been approved by the District Court, and the notarized marriage is scheduled to be held on the 24th.

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 17th] Li Agui, a villager from Yusha Township, Xiangcheng, worked as a helper at the home of Cai Furuo, a farmer in a neighboring village. On October 21st of this year, Agui was chatting and laughing in the room of Cai Furuo's sister-in-law, Shen. Cai Furuo and his brother suspected that there was an illicit relationship and beat Agui with a bamboo shoulder pole, killing him on the spot. In shock and regret, Furuo and his brother warmed the body with a foot stove and wrapped it in a quilt the next day. They used a boat to send the body back to Li's house, falsely claiming that Agui had accidentally eaten Datura stramonium (commonly known as "drunk fairy peach") and was poisoned by alcohol. Later, Li A'wu, Agui's father, discovered the wounds. He negotiated with Furuo and his brother. As a result, the local Deputy Chief Shi Jun took the initiative to mediate a private settlement, and ordered Cai Furuo to subsidize Li A'wu with 100 stones of rice. Unexpectedly, after Cai Furuo's incident, the social expenses were huge, and the promised rice to Li A'wu had not been paid for a long time. On the 13th of this month, the two parties came to the city again to negotiate at the Jiuru Tea House on Lindun Road.

Raw peanuts were continuously handled by Guangdong merchants, and local merchants also participated, competing to purchase, rising straight up by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Wheat continued to rise by 10,000 yuan. The oil market had strong buying sentiment, with prices rising across the board. Raw tung oil soared by 100,000 yuan. Soybean oil followed suit, soaring by 60,000-70,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil increased by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Perilla oil followed, rising by 30,000-40,000 yuan, and light oil also rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan.

### Rayon Opened Steady, Then Rose Sharply at Closing

The rayon market was very stable yesterday morning, but rose sharply again in the afternoon, resulting in an increase of 6 million yuan compared to the previous day. Article 120, Asahi brand 1A bright, opened at 102 million yuan, once reaching a high of 5 million yuan, and then fell back to close at 3 million yuan at noon. The final asking price in the afternoon was 8 million yuan. Asahi brand 4A was asking for 95 million yuan, and Toyo Station 4A was around 100 million yuan.

Raw Silk

Due to sluggish actual sales, the market was very soft yesterday morning, but better in the afternoon. As a result, the asking price was not much different from the previous day. Grade C was traded in two lots yesterday, at 73 million yuan and 3.8 million yuan respectively. Gao Ling Zu was previously traded at 71 million yuan, and was traded at 72.5 million yuan in the afternoon. Medium grade was traded in the morning at 67 million yuan, and in the afternoon at 9 million yuan. Gan Jing was firmer yesterday, and ordinary was traded at 50 million yuan.

Silk Fabrics

The market was expensive yesterday. Zhen Silk, quilt covers, Dachang, and Huaqiang goods were traded in the morning at 69 million yuan for immediate closing, and 70.5 million yuan for deferred delivery. Market sentiment was booming in the afternoon, and prices surged across the board, with the final price reaching as high as 84 million yuan. For other goods, factory prices have recently been insufficient to cover costs. Due to narrow actual sales, market prices have failed to keep up with raw materials. Therefore, factory prices were generally not released yesterday afternoon. Common goods such as Huajin crepe were asking for 67,000 yuan, Minsheng special grade serge was asking for 75,000 yuan, and Lin's waxed feather yarn was asking for 72,000 yuan, all of which were morning market prices.

(Our dispatch) The Central Trust of China has not allocated rayon for a long time. According to Deputy Director Luo, 5,000 cases of Japanese rayon will arrive in Shanghai within 32 days, and sales will resume.

### Stable Green Tea for Export

Domestic tea sales continue to flow smoothly due to sales in local shops and merchants, so buyers still have the upper hand, and the situation is trending positively. As for the foreign merchants' tea market, there were both inflows and outflows of Keemun black tea, and the market atmosphere changed little. As for green teas such as Chunmee and Gunpowder, which are sold to Africa, since sellers have become increasingly firm in their sales intentions due to the scarcity of goods, exporters have tried to continue to suppress prices, but have ultimately failed. Therefore, transactions have been gloomy so far, but the process remains stable.

### China Aluminum and Steel Factory Supplies Steel-Lined Paper for Tea Packaging

For tea exports, packaging is usually done using wooden boxes lined with tin foil. This tin foil is actually lead and is lined with inferior paper. It is not only unhygienic, but also easily damaged due to manual production, failing to achieve the effect of moisture resistance and lacking aesthetic appeal. The China Aluminum and Steel Factory of this city, in view of this situation, has imitated foreign tea packaging methods and created a type of steel-lined paper for tea packaging to meet demand. It is not only bright and beautiful, and only one-quarter the weight of lead, but also strong and durable, saving the cost of backing paper and reducing costs significantly.

### The Second Batch of Barter Paper Coupons Will Be Handled Uniformly by the Central Trust

The Central Trust of China has entrusted the China Tobacco Company with allocating the paper coupons for barter trade with Japan to various cigarette factories, with 80% allocated to this city and 20% allocated to other cities. When applying, each cigarette factory must submit a tax bill from the Ministry of Finance and be certified by the association. It is reported that the quota for this batch of paper coupons has already been allocated. Factories that have not been allocated will be allocated when the second batch arrives. The current allocation price is under negotiation. It is rumored that it can be hoped to be at least 80% lower than the market price. It has also been decided that the task of allocating the second batch will be handled uniformly by the National Cigarette Industry Association and distributed widely to factories across the country.

Commercial Briefs

Regarding loan collateral and remittance, the salt merchants association will request a loan from the banking syndicate based on the current official price of 260,000 yuan per *dan*, deducting 100,000 yuan for salt tax and using 160,000 yuan for collateral remittance at a 70% discount. The banking syndicate has submitted a request to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval, which is currently under review.

The Four Banks Branch held its 112th regular meeting and approved ten loan applications totaling over 10 billion yuan, which will be submitted to the head office for approval.

Taiwan Paper Company: Due to the recent decrease in imported paper, the company will actively increase production of various types of paper. Currently, white newsprint is only for domestic use within Taiwan, while other types of paper, such as woodfree paper, kraft paper, and cardboard, are exported. The company is currently sending personnel to investigate the average monthly paper consumption in this city as a reference for supply and sales.

The intellectual system lecture series organized by the local Youth Association featured Mr. Zhang Yushan lecturing yesterday on "A Review of China's International Trade Policy."

### Speaking Frankly, "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" is an Important Document

— Nan

When listening to people talk or reading their writings, I often feel that criticism of a new author easily falls into two clichés: either praising the book to the heavens or condemning it to the depths of hell, with very few balanced opinions. The criticism of Bernays's new book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" by people from various countries is no exception.

Those who praise the book believe that it is an outstanding masterpiece of international politics in recent years, and point out two major advantages of the book: First, because Bernays participated in the most secret international political negotiations before President Roosevelt's death, and was the US Secretary of State who mediated on the international stage after Truman succeeded as President, he said many things that ordinary people could not say; Second, because he is no longer directly involved in politics, he does not have to be as scrupulous as those who hold important positions in the current government, so he said many things that ordinary people would not dare to say. Some even consider him a true warrior fighting for the freedom of the world's people, and a giant who unyieldingly defends international justice. Therefore, his book is also regarded as an important classic in modern diplomatic history.

Those who criticize him and his book naturally have a different view. They say that Bernays is a spokesman for American capitalism, that he uses a set of hypocritical language, distorted secrets, and his current non-existent position to achieve his anti-Soviet goals hidden deep in his heart, and that he secretly wants to unite with the warmongers in the United States to prepare for a comeback, attempting to implement a policy of world domination. Leftists in various countries echo this view, and Soviet newspapers and senior government officials even call him a "war profiteer" without any emotion.

People with a more objective attitude cannot casually accept the above-mentioned extreme views, because these words are mostly the words of propagandists, not the views of serious critics. Propagandists have too much subjective content, they only know "black" and "white", and do not know that there are many different degrees of darkness and lightness between black and white. They only know how to make people believe what they believe, and do not know how to approach the truth from various positions and angles, and even to understand the truth. To gain benefits from reading, readers must have the spirit of understanding the truth from various angles and positions.

I often like to observe people quarreling from the sidelines, but I am unwilling to easily judge right and wrong. Based on experience, most quarrels arise from different positions leading to different viewpoints. "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" contains a large part of the record of several subtle quarrels between Bernays and Molotov. Since the evolution of US-Soviet relations is the mainstream of the world situation, and these quarrels can represent the different positions and viewpoints of the US and the Soviet Union, the content is very informative, and those who care about the fate of the world should read it. In fact, to understand the truth of international politics, Bernays's writings should be read, and if Molotov has any writings, they should also be read. The remarks of Vandenberg and Taft should be paid attention to, and the remarks of Wallace and Roosevelt Jr. should not be easily let go. The thoughts of moderate socialists such as Bevin and Attlee should be studied, and the movements of Conservative leader Churchill and Labour left-wing leader Bevan should also be constantly watched... By collecting the remarks of various experts and examining various political trends, if a judgment is to be made, it should be made at this time to be more practical and closer to the truth. Even with Bernays's "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy," it should be compared with the statements of other experts to carefully weigh what is right and wrong. If a book truly has value and truly contains the truth, then after such a comparison, this value and this truth will not be diminished, but will become more obvious, more concrete, and more prominent.

The different positions and differing viewpoints of the US and the Soviet Union are very obvious. Bernays particularly emphasizes in "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" that since the Yalta Conference, the Soviet Union's expansionist tendencies have become increasingly obvious, and the torrent of communism is spreading in all directions with the Soviet Union as its center. Although Stalin and other Soviet officials have repeatedly said that two different economies can coexist, and even cooperate with each other, some people in the United States believe that "words" are one thing, and "deeds" are another. Since the Soviet Union believes that communism is the ultimate destination of the world, then even temporary cooperation with capitalist countries is only a means, not an end. Therefore, the United States cannot trust it. As for the Soviet Union, it believes that although the United States advocates democratic politics and free competition, free competition tends to turn into monopoly to a considerable extent. The result of economic monopoly may lead to the decline of free competition domestically, and may lead to the competition for world markets, and even war. In the book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy," these fundamental contradictions between the US and the Soviet Union are clearly expressed.

The same shape may appear square from one angle, rectangular from another angle, and yet another shape from another angle. The same high mountain appears towering from the ground, but appears as flat as a mound from an airplane. Different positions lead to differences in the perception of all things in the world. The positions of the US and the Soviet Union are different, so the criteria for measuring each other are also different, and the decisions on policies are naturally difficult to be consistent. Due to the complexity of the problems and the multitude of issues involved, hasty judgments or oversimplification is not an attitude that a truth seeker should hold. Truth cannot be obtained with a mere wave of a hand or a step of the foot, but should be obtained from reading, thinking, and observing more. Newton discovered the three laws of motion, but Einstein modified them based on the theory of relativity, thus moving closer to the truth. This courageous spirit of scientists should also be the spirit that students of international politics should have.

Bernays is the former Secretary of State of the United States. During his tenure, the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union transitioned from wartime cooperation to peacetime antagonism. The book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" reflects the process of this transition. Objectively speaking, it should be an important source of information in modern diplomatic history.

### Honest Words

— Deng Shuxun

Bernays's famous book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" was originally titled "Honest Words." Here, Bernays claims to have spoken honestly.

Whether Bernays has spoken honestly in his "Honest Words" is unknown (in fact, only he himself knows), but because he emphasizes that he has spoken honestly this time, it can indirectly prove that what he said in the past was not honest, and at the same time, it can further prove the unreliability of diplomats' words. More than "Inside USA" sold

### "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy"

— Lao Qi

According to a telegram from the United States: The book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" (originally titled Honest Words) by former US Secretary of State Bernays has seen astonishing sales since its publication on October 15, surpassing the book "Inside USA" by Gunther.

The success of this book is not accidental. In this book, Bernays reveals the secrets of the diplomatic meetings of the four powers before and after victory with an honest writing style. As American book reviews generally say, it is a factual account of the inside story of modern diplomacy, and at the same time, it implies the future trends of American national policy.

This is an essential diplomatic history. Now I will give a brief introduction to it. The book has 316 pages and is divided into five sections, each section is divided into four paragraphs. The table of contents is as follows: The Crisis of Awareness and Responsibility; Yalta - The Climax of Three-Power Unity; The Situation Begins to Change; Potsdam - Failure to Achieve Success; Frustration in London; The Moscow Conference Reaches a Stalemate; The London Conference Once, Paris Twice; The Paris Peace Conference and the New York Conference; Central Europe - Severe Trials; The Path of Action; Moving Towards Peace in Asia; Establishing a People's Diplomacy Policy; Control of Atomic Energy; What is the Soviet Union Pursuing? Where Are We Going From Here?

The last paragraph of the third section, "Moving Towards Peace in Asia," mentions China. Bernays begins by writing in a straightforward manner: "We must not forget that World War II broke out in the Pacific." This sentence illustrates the importance of Asia in the current crisis. He went on to say: "If we believe that Europe may become the fuse of a world war, then we must regard Asia as a very large flame." This is a very pertinent and accurate statement.

Regarding China, Bernays wrote: "China is still far from peace; what can be said is that China is on the verge of great change, and we should encourage and assist this change within the realm of possibility. China needs our technical assistance, but China should be responsible for implementation in order to achieve success." Here, he explains the importance of American aid to China, which is also understood by other American leaders, but the recent $300 million loan is really too disappointing.

Bernays also said: The importance of China is not only understood by the United States, but also by the Soviet Union. In this regard, he reveals the Soviet Union's intentions towards China. He proves that at the Yalta Conference, Stalin stated that the price of the Soviet Union's participation in the war was the joint management of the two major railways in Northeast China, turning Dalian into a free port, and establishing a naval base in Lushun.

Bernays also narrated his direct meeting with Stalin. Regarding this, Bernays said: "I told Stalin that Chairman Chiang's government is the only possible government in China. The Chinese Communist Party is not a real Communist Party." Stalin acknowledged in his reply that the National Government was the legitimate government. The most interesting thing is that Stalin believes that Mao Zedong exaggerated the strength of the Communist army too much. When Bernays told him that Mao Zedong boasted of having 600,000 troops in the Tianjin area, Stalin couldn't help but laugh a few times.

Regarding Asia, Bernays's conclusion is this: "The security of the United States itself and world peace depend on the progress of Asia." This is certainly a very accurate view. In the two years since the victory over Germany, Bernays has fought unremittingly for peace. He has traveled a total of 77,000 miles. From January 1945 to October 1946, he participated in a total of eight major conferences, namely: the Yalta Three-Power Conference from January 22 to February 12, 1945; the Potsdam Conference from July 6 to August 7; the London Foreign Ministers Conference from September 4 to October 8; the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference from December 12 to 29; the United Nations General Assembly held in London from January 7 to 25, 1946; the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference from April 23 to May 18 of the same year; the Paris Foreign Ministers Conference from June 13 to July 14 of the same year; and the Twenty-One Nation Peace Conference from July 27 to October 17 of the same year. This masterpiece has been collectively translated by colleagues from the *Shen Bao*. I have read it once, and the translation is accurate, fluent, and beautiful. It will be published by News and World soon, and pre-orders are available at this newspaper.

I solemnly recommend this masterpiece and excellent translation to those who care about the interactions of the four powers.

### Bernays's Secrets

— Pingzhai

When General Marshall returned from China to become Secretary of State, the news agencies spread a very interesting message, saying that his predecessor, Bernays, had prepared a thick volume of extremely secret "blueprints" and that Marshall only had to act according to the book, and there would be no mistakes. Many journalists tried to find out what was in this "blueprint," but repeated failures finally cooled their burning hearts.

Bernays has always been known in diplomatic circles for his eloquence and frankness, and this can be seen to some extent in his book "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy." Of course, this book may not be the materials left to Marshall, but his frank personality did lead him to reveal many confidential materials—and from these confidential materials, it is not difficult for us to find out more confidential clues. When world politics becomes power politics, many small countries and nations become the sacrifices of bargaining. In order not to harm the self-esteem of these small countries and nations, everything is done behind the scenes, and everything becomes confidential. When these secrets are revealed to the world, people suddenly realize who has spread the seeds of disputes and even wars, but it is often too late.

The people who know the most about these secrets are of course the diplomats responsible for international mediation, especially the foreign ministers who oversee the diplomacy of a country. Bernays resolutely wrote this book, which, in the eyes of future historians, is an immortal achievement. I admire Bernays's courage, because after this book is published, his diplomatic career will probably never be restored.

### The Author of "Frankly Speaking," Burnes

— Bin Zhi

Burnes was originally a junior clerk at the Carletons law firm. He used his spare time to learn shorthand and study law, eventually becoming a qualified lawyer. After that, he ran a newspaper, served as a judge, and slowly stepped onto the political stage. During World War I, he was the closest and most trusted assistant to Undersecretary of the Navy Roosevelt. In 1932, when Roosevelt ran for president, he was the only important figure behind the scenes. Although he did not broadcast, did not give speeches, did not write articles, and rarely appeared in public gatherings, he kept his finger on the pulse of American politics, guiding the development of the American political path.

After Roosevelt entered the White House, Burnes remained in the Senate. In 1941, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, seemingly temporarily ending his relationship with other American political issues. In fact, he was still Roosevelt's most trusted advisor, and his advice was sought on the decisions and execution of many issues. In 1943, Burnes assumed the post of Director of the Economic Stabilization Board, marking the beginning of his actual work on the American political stage as it moved towards global war. Later, he was reassigned as the Director of the War Mobilization Board, becoming the supreme commander on the American home front. After the victory, he was selected to handle the affairs of the Secretary of State, shuttling between the two sides of the Atlantic, and negotiating in the international arena to strive for world peace.

In previous international conferences, deadlocks were broken, and opposing opinions were reconciled. Although Burnes can be said to have achieved some success, it was the result of his countless painstaking efforts. "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" is a record of Burnes' participation in the previous meetings, not only a snapshot of the conference, but also a detailed record of the secrets beyond the conference and the tricks played by various countries. International relations are inherently complex, with intrigue and competition for dominance, and the post-war world appears even more intricate and mysterious. How Burnes broke the deadlock in international relations is fully revealed in "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy."

### Seeing the Soviet Diplomatic Style from "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy"

— Jun Mo

After the outbreak of World War II, several books about the inside stories of diplomacy emerged, all written by people who personally took on the task of negotiation, such as former British Ambassador to Germany Henderson's "Failure of a Mission: Berlin 1937-1939," former US Ambassador to Japan Grew's "Ten Years in Japan," and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt's "For the President: Personal and Secret: Correspondence Between Franklin D. Roosevelt and William C. Bullitt." These books are all written with vivid prose and have their own value, but they also have a common shortcoming: the events described therein now seem like "yesterday's news," making us feel that they have little value as a reference. Only former Secretary of State Burnes' "The Secret of Four-Power Diplomacy" (originally titled "Speaking Frankly"), published in the United States in mid-October, describes figures such as Truman, Stalin, Molotov, and Bevin, who are all key figures on the political stage, and the diplomatic secrets depicted in the book, the haggling in various important conferences, as well as the post-war settlement of Europe, diplomatic issues with China, etc., are still developing and have not been resolved. We have no way of knowing the actual inside story of international conferences, but after reading this book, it is as if we are sitting at the table with Truman, Stalin, and others, listening to them arguing heatedly one day and seeing them toasting each other the next. Moreover, we can also understand from this book how many of the diplomatic problems we face today, especially the issues of the Soviet Union and Dalian in Northeast China, have come about.

This book is truly as the title suggests, "Speaking Frankly," laying everything out without fire, without prejudice, but without concealing the facts, so after the book was published, many people criticized the author, saying that he should not have revealed so many facts so casually. But from this, we can also imagine the value of this book.

As a Chinese, we are naturally very concerned about the parts of the book that concern China and the Soviet diplomatic style. I think this book is extremely helpful in understanding the Soviet style. Here, let's just cite a few interesting examples to get a glimpse.

For example, the issue of reparations: after the Soviet army arrived in the Northeast, they took away the machinery and materials from our Northeast, leaving the factories empty shells. However, they said that these were their "spoils of war." The situation was the same in Europe. After the Soviet army entered Romania, the German army retreated, and the Romanian oil fields originally had many properties of British and American merchants, including extremely valuable machinery. These machines had been frozen when the Germans occupied them. Later, after Germany surrendered and Romania was liberated, Burnes mentioned to Molotov about reclaiming these properties of the British and Americans, but the Soviet Union refused. Their reason was very ridiculous. They said: many of these machines were ordered from German manufacturers by British and American merchants before the war, so there were "Made in Germany" trademarks on them. Since these machines were made in Germany before, then they are certainly not British or American, so they are spoils of war and can be confiscated. The definition of spoils of war was originally limited to the enemy's war materials obtained in the war, but as a result, even the furniture, sofas, and vases in the houses in Berlin were taken away by Soviet officers. In this way, the issue of reparations could not be calculated at all. The American side questioned the Soviet Union about this, but the Soviet Union had another set of inexplicable explanations, even explaining pianos, sofas, and vases as war materials, so they were often treated as spoils of war, leaving the American reparations commissioner Pauley dumbfounded and speechless for a long time.

Another thing can also be cited to see what kind of attitude should be adopted when dealing with diplomacy with the Soviet Union. At the Potsdam Conference, for several issues, the Soviet Union insisted on its own opinions and refused to budge, and it was about to end without results. Burnes came up with a way to put the two things that the United States insisted on and the issue of reparations that the Soviet Union hoped to resolve together into one proposal, and explained the maximum limit that the United States could accept, and then asked the Soviet Union to decide, to agree to all three things together, or to oppose all three things together. If they opposed, the American representatives would leave Potsdam and return home the next day, and the meeting would not continue. Stalin was initially very dissatisfied, thinking that Burnes was using "this cunning trick," selling rotten apples and good apples together, so he requested individual discussions. But Burnes insisted on discussing them together. As a result, Stalin had no choice but to agree to all three things because he did not want the issue of reparations to remain unresolved, so the meeting took a sharp turn for the better and ended successfully. Burnes initially thought that Stalin would be very unhappy with him for this matter, but unexpectedly, just the opposite, when the meeting ended, and the two sides raised their glasses to congratulate each other, Stalin specifically mentioned to Truman, thanking and admiring Burnes' efforts, which made the matter successfully resolved.

There are many other examples in the book that prove that Russians respond to strength, not weakness. Whenever you concede, they will take an inch and want a mile, and there is no end; but when you insist on your position and do not waver, they will admire you and concede themselves.

This is the experience personally gained by the author of this book, former US Secretary of State Burnes, in handling diplomacy with the Soviet Union. This experience is still of great reference value to us today.

### Rare News of Elizabeth's Wedding

— Lin Lin

For Princess Elizabeth's wedding procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey, windows in buildings along the route were rented out at high prices, with profits exceeding those of the 1937 coronation ceremony.

On Whitehall, where the procession could be seen for two or three minutes, the rental price for two windows had reached 100 pounds. During the coronation, the rental price for the entire room was only 50 pounds. According to one landlord's estimate, the annual rent for a room there is only 100 pounds. Now it is rented to twenty-two people at a high price of 900 pounds, which translates to 40 pounds per person. Each window seat is also rented for 75 pounds.

Scotland Yard notified all landlords that anyone who bought tickets to watch the procession from the windows must leave their names with the police station.

The design of Elizabeth's wedding cake has been approved by the princess. The cake is divided into four layers. The first layer features the emblems of the new couple, the Windsor crest, the Beaumont crest, and the Buckingham Palace cupola. The second layer features the jewel box the princess received when she was conferred the honorary freedom of Windsor; the princess inspecting troops as the Colonel of the Guards; the Battle of Monte Cassino; various musical symbols; and patterns of various sports. The third layer is a Cupid holding a shield with the initials of the new couple inscribed, the Royal Navy emblem, the emblems of the Auxiliary Territorial Service and the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, and the HMS Valiant, the flagship that Captain Mountbatten served on during the Battle of Monte Cassino. The fourth layer features the national emblems of the Dominions, namely Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Pakistan.

According to British custom, the queen still takes her father's surname after marriage, but her children take their husband's surname. Therefore, Victoria became the last of the Hanoverians, and her son Edward VII became the first of the Saxe-Coburg and Gotha line. However, the dynastic name can also be changed by decree, as the British royal family changed its name to Windsor in 1917. Therefore, the British royal family will be surnamed Windsor, while Elizabeth's children will be surnamed Mountbatten.

### Elizabeth—Various Things on the Eve of the Wedding

— Broken Wheel

November 20th is the date of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth of Britain and Lieutenant Mountbatten. The ceremony will be held at Westminster Abbey. This wedding is a major event in British history; because Princess Elizabeth is not only the heir to the British throne, but also the heir to the thrones of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa under the Statute of Westminster.

The wedding is quite grand, although in the face of the post-war British recession, everything has been frugal, but it is still dazzling enough. The work of preparing for the ceremony falls on the Lord Chamberlain, who ranks at the head of the court, and the work is indeed very complicated. This minister is Lord Clarendon, who is already seventy years old, and has presided over hundreds of court ceremonies. Behind his court dress is a embroidered key, indicating that the keys to the palace are under his control.

This wedding cannot be equated with a state ceremony, it belongs to a semi-state affair. Therefore, although all the rituals of a royal wedding will be followed, the ceremony will be reduced compared to a full state ceremony. The most important and significant result of this decision is that male guests do not have to wear the court dress of exquisitely gold-trimmed coats, knee breeches, and cocked hats. Morning dress, military uniform, or even casual wear is appropriate; female guests will wear afternoon dresses with hats, and the length of skirts and dresses is at their own discretion.

But Princess Elizabeth will take the state ceremonial escort of the British monarch in a four-horse open carriage, accompanied by a full complement of coachmen, from the palace to the temple for the ceremony; and the groom will also use a carriage escort, as will the Queen and Princess Margaret. As for the exact time of departure and arrival at the temple, this is also one of the details to be decided by Lord Clarendon. About two thousand invitations to the ceremony are being distributed. The issuance of these invitations is a slightly difficult matter for some people. Naturally, the royal family and the groom's family must attend, as well as the cabinet ministers of the British government and the leaders of the opposition parties, to show that political boundaries are irrelevant to happy events. All foreign envoys in London, whether ambassadors, ministers, or chargés d'affaires, must also receive invitations. The same is true for the High Commissioners of the British Commonwealth in London. Although not all Commonwealth Prime Ministers may attend, there will always be a few who will attend the ceremony in person. Invitations to the royal families of Europe were announced on October 31st. The list includes the King of Norway, the King of Romania, the King and Queen of Denmark, Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia, Queen Eugenia of Spain, Dowager Queen Marie of Yugoslavia, Prince Charles of Belgium, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and Prince Bernhard, the Crown Prince and Princess of Sweden, Prince Axel of Greece, Prince and Princess George of Greece, Prince Christopher of Greece, Princess Eugenie of Greece, Princess Axel and Prince Borghese of Denmark, Prince George of Denmark, Prince Fay of Denmark, Prince John and Princess Elizabeth of Luxembourg. There are 103 seats for journalists in the sanctuary of the Western Church, and their distribution is 22 seats for British Commonwealth newspapers, 13 seats for foreign newspapers, 12 seats for American newspapers, and 57 seats for British newspapers.

Due to the lack of wood, steel, and manpower, there will be no magnificent decorations on the streets as there were during the coronation, and there will be no stands along the way. Westminster Abbey will also not have any special decorations. But British children will receive a packet of food.

The ceremony will definitely be held in a religious form. The ceremony will probably be presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and assisted by the Archbishop of York.

There will be no ball to celebrate the wedding, because the Ministry of Food stipulates that social activities are limited to 100 guests. In order to accelerate the export plan, there will be no public holidays, but schools will be closed for one day.

King George VI broke the tradition of 250 years and decided to accept the words of allegiance offered by the Roman Catholic Church in Britain at the Princess's wedding. Since King James II (a Catholic) abdicated in 1689, Roman Catholics, including cardinals and bishops, have not been able to directly offer tributes to the British monarch.

### Thoughts on Winter Relief

— Listening to Autumn

The winter relief fundraising organized by charitable people from all walks of life and the Social Affairs Bureau, gentlemen from the entertainment industry have been broadcasting charity performances for days. Everyone is doing their best to fulfill their responsibility of "contributing their efforts"; calling for help on behalf of the poor, and asking the "rich" to donate generously!

The Social Affairs Bureau originally planned to attach 20% of the film ticket price to the winter relief donation. This method was originally to relieve the poor, increase the income of relief funds, so that the poor people can drink more porridge!

Unfortunately, film merchants only care about their own interests and vigorously oppose the additional donation; although the director of the Social Affairs Bureau insisted on compulsory collection again and again. But how can they fight against the film merchants who hold the real power? They even jointly stated that if they are determined to collect relief donations, they would rather withdraw the film and stop showing it as a protest.

The additional collection of relief donations on movie tickets has been canceled from the original plan, and other methods have been formulated. The income of relief funds will inevitably be affected.

Following that, the winter relief horse racing is bound to be another empty proposal that cannot be implemented.

Look! The Wanguo Sports Association has already released a statement. Excuse: Because of years of stagnation, it is not easy to gather and organize it at once. The meaning is: unwilling to do unprofitable charity races that only require "effort". Therefore, whether the winter relief horse racing can be implemented is still uncertain.

The poor who are suffering from hunger and cold are suffering bitterly. The winter relief fundraising has suffered a double blow, and the income of relief funds will inevitably be affected.

### The Fish That Climbs Trees

— Lin Mei

"Climbing a tree to catch fish" is a Chinese idiom, which means that if we want to catch fish, we must go to the water. If we climb trees to catch fish, we are going the wrong way and we will not get the fish. Of course, this is correct. However, you must know that the world is a strange world, and the path you take may as well be two, but the goal achieved can be one. For example, invaders can use force to achieve their purpose of invasion, but if you use political methods or economic power to invade people, this can also achieve the same purpose as force. This is called "different routes to the same destination."

You must go to the water to catch fish, but you can also catch fish by climbing a tree. Friends, are you surprised to see me say this? No need! The world is so big, there are all kinds of wonders, and it is not that there are no fish walking on land or climbing trees. For example, when we go to the countryside, we don't need to talk about any remote places that are not easy to find on the map. Just take the suburbs of Shanghai as an example. In the small rivers in the countryside, there is often a kind of small fish that comes out of the water and jumps on the wetlands by the river. The villagers call this kind of small fish "Luhe", and its scientific name is salamander, so it is not that there are no fish walking on land.

In the West Indies, there is a kind of fish called "climbing fish", which has a special habit. Every once in a while, it has to climb out of the water and walk on land for a while. Sometimes, it also climbs up the roots of trees by the river like a naughty kitten. However, it does not climb very high, only a few inches. Like other fish, it has no feet, and uses its fins to stand up its body.

This is not nonsense. We can see the specimens of this kind of fish in museums; if you live near an aquarium, you can see active fish in the aquarium! If there is no aquarium where you live, then in March and April, you can also see a salamander walking on land in the small rivers in the suburbs of Shanghai. It can also climb a few inches on the roots of trees, but its shape is not very similar to the fish we usually eat. However, this can prove that fish can climb trees, and "green wood" may be able to "catch fish."

### Miscellaneous Notes Under the Lamp: What Kind of Jinshi (Successful Candidate in the Imperial Examinations) Was Grand Historian Sima Qian?

— Feng Ren

Wang Yuxiang's Xiangzu Notes has the following passage:

"When Song Lichang, the provincial governor, was reading a book attentively, there came a dignified old scholar who was a successful candidate. He asked, "What book is the child reading?" The History Records was answered. He asked, "Who wrote it?" He replied, "The Grand Historian." He asked, "What kind of Jinshi (Successful Candidate in the Imperial Examinations) was Grand Historian Sima Qian?" He replied, "The Grand Historian of the Han Dynasty was not today's Jinshi." So he took the book and read it, but after a few lines, he discarded it and said, "I don't see anything good, what's the point of reading it?" Then he walked away in a dignified manner." This is certainly a joke today, but it was indeed a very common fact at the time. The imperial examination was originally intended to bind the thoughts of scholars, so that they would specialize in the so-called classics of the Analects and the Book of Songs, and not to have them find their original shape from history, so it is really no wonder that the Jinshi did not read history.

### Shadow Plays of the Han Dynasty

— Zhu Li

Li Furen, the concubine of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, had a very good appearance, so she was especially loved by the emperor. After Li died, the emperor missed her constantly. At that time, there was a magician Shao Weng from Qi, who said that he could bring her spirit, and the emperor believed him and watched him do it, and indeed saw a beautiful woman like Li Furen. The emperor saw her and missed her even more sadly, and once wrote a poem saying: "Is it her? Is it not her? Standing and looking at her, why does she come so slowly!"

As for how the magician did it, there is the following record in the Book of Han: "The magician Shao Weng from Qi said that he could bring her spirit, so he set up lanterns and candles at night, set up tents and curtains, arranged wine and meat, and ordered the emperor to live in another tent, and remotely saw a beautiful woman like Li Furen, returning to the tent and walking around, but he was not allowed to approach and see…"

After reading the above sentence "set up lanterns and candles at night, set up tents and curtains," you can imagine that its method is the same as the principle of shadow plays.

Miss America

### Miss America and Victory Gardens

— Xu Shuyuan

"Victory Garden" was a product of World War II. The American people were not a flower-loving nation and engaged in horticulture because they were "forced to do so." Because all food was under control during the war, canned food was especially strictly controlled. Americans would not starve to death, but when the war started, a large number of cans were transported to the front, and ordinary people could not buy enough food, so they had to loosen the soil in front of and behind their houses and turn it into gardens. They bought bags of seeds from grocery stores and started to cultivate them in a big way. There were many kinds of seeds, no less than hundreds of kinds. Each bag cost one dime, and the contents were printed in color on the bag, allowing people to choose. Families usually planted tomatoes, green peppers, eggplants, pearl rice, celery, and melons, and also raised chickens and ducks. In this way, they could reduce the family burden and encourage family labor, saving the time they spent in movie theaters, nightclubs, and bars for productive work.

Miss America attaches great importance to victory gardens. The word "victory" foreshadows "the inevitable victory of the war of resistance and the success of national construction." The most significant meaning of victory gardens is to make hundreds of thousands of families of soldiers in the War of Resistance happy. When their husbands are fighting bloody battles overseas, and their life and death are unpredictable, they can spend a large part of their lonely time in horticulture. In this way, they can purify their minds, reduce their desires, and quietly wait for their husbands to return home in triumph. Therefore, victory in gardens has made great contributions to moral construction during the war. This kind of invisible moral defense is more effective than the propaganda and deception of "those who eat moral rice, who have mouths full of benevolence, righteousness, and morality, but are male thieves and female prostitutes in their bellies." What a soldier who was born and died overseas hopes for when he lays down his arms and returns to the fields is two things that make him feel satisfied: the first thing is that his wife has not run away with anyone, and there is still Wang Tian (land) to cultivate; the second thing is that there is a victory garden behind the house, where he can try the leisurely years of "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence" and forget the cruel experience of bayonet fighting on the front line. Where does the hope of a veteran lie? He wants a loyal wife, a quiet home, and a green vegetable garden. American soldiers have got what they wanted in all three things.

Social Service

### Provisional Measures for Collecting Security Deposits for Public Utilities

The Social Services Section of your newspaper forwarded a letter from Mr. Wang Fangrui, a citizen, regarding the question of the French Concession Electricity Company's increased water charges before September 1, and requested that we verify it and reply directly. We have checked that the adjustment of water prices in September was approved by the Municipal Government. Starting from the meter reading date of September 1, the new prices are calculated. Therefore, the company's calculation based on the new prices on the meter reading date is in line with the original plan and there is no conflict. As for the section in the original letter involving the increase in security deposits, in order to avoid excessive burden on users, this Bureau proposed the "Provisional Measures for the Collection of Security Deposits for Public Utilities in Shanghai Municipality", which was passed by the 86th Municipal Conference. Accordingly, a copy of the measures is attached and returned to you for reference! This is addressed to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Sincerely, the Public Utilities Bureau of Shanghai Municipality.

Provisional Measures for the Agreement on the Collection of Security Deposits for Public Utilities in Shanghai Municipality. Since July 1947, the increase in security deposits for various public utilities shall be limited to twice a year, with a time interval of six months between the two times. The amount of each increase shall be based on the standard of supplementing the user's one-month consumption cost. For each increase in security deposits, the company may consider the situation and collect it in one or two installments. The security deposit for new users shall be calculated based on the unit price of the month of use and the estimated consumption for one month.
