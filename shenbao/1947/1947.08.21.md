### National Troops Reach Laizhou Bay Coast; Communist Land Connection Between Northern Shandong and Shandong Peninsula Severed; Liu Bocheng's Remnants Flee Towards Dabie Mountains

[Our Qingdao Daily Dispatch] After the national troops crossed the Xiaoqing River, they completely controlled the line from Gaoyuan to Yangjiaogou, with no communist bandits south or north of the Xiaoqing River. The land connection between communist troops in northern Shandong and the Shandong Peninsula has been severed for the first time. The vanguard of the national troops has reached the coast of Laizhou Bay. Communist troops are fleeing towards Putai and Huimin. It is expected that the south bank of the Yellow River will soon be completely recovered. Currently, communist troops still occupy small stations along the Jiaoji Railway between Gaomi and Fangzi to protect their supply routes along the coast. It is reported that the actual strength of the communist troops in Jiaodong is only one column.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 20th] After the national troops recovered Boxing, north of the Xiaoqing River, they continued to mop up the surrounding areas on the 20th. The western route has advanced to the vicinity of Gaoyuan. The national troops advancing north from Changshan also approached the outskirts of Huanhecheng on the 20th after recovering Datian. The Wang Yaowu division of the national troops, after recovering Boshan, joined forces with the Ou Zhen division advancing north from Laiwu on the 20th near Hezhuang, and are continuing to clear out scattered remnants in the surrounding areas. On the 20th, the national air force scouted towns along the lower reaches of the Yellow River and discovered about fifty communist trucks gathered near Putai. They strafed and bombed them, destroying a total of about thirty trucks.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 20th] The national troops advancing south from Zichuan recovered Boshan County on the 20th. The entire Zhangbo branch line is now in the hands of our troops, and they are continuing to mop up the remaining communist bandits on both sides of the railway. Also, the Wang Yaowu division of the national troops recovered Boxing on the afternoon of the 19th. In addition, the air force sank more than 400 bandit ships in the area between the Xiaoqing River, Yangjiaogou, and Longkou on the 19th.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 20th] After successively recovering Huaiyang, Fugou, Yanling, and Xihua on the 19th, the national troops in eastern Henan crossed the Ying River and pursued and annihilated the communist bandit Liu as he fled south into southern Henan. The remnants of the bandit's 36th column reached the Runan and Zhengyang areas on the 20th. The remnants of his 127th column fled to the Shenqiu and Xincai area on the 20th. The center of the war has clearly shifted from eastern Henan to southern Henan. The plan of Liu's remnants to flee to the Dabie Mountains and Tongbai Mountains is becoming increasingly evident.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 20th] The communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops have crossed the Sha River and fled towards the northeastern foothills of the Dabie Mountains. The national troops' pursuing units crossed the Wo River on the evening of the 18th and advanced towards Huaiyang. The bandits who disturbed the northeast of Xuchang have also been completely annihilated by the national troops.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 20th] The communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops, who roamed through Henan and Anhui, have been fleeing under the scorching sun for days. Many have suffered from heatstroke. Furthermore, after being repeatedly attacked by the combined forces of the army and air force, they have lost their will to fight and are surrendering in large numbers. The bandits at Xin'anji, north of Shenqiu, are crossing the Sha River and heading towards Xiangcheng. Their westward flight is likely aimed at the Funiu Mountains.

### Soviet Ships Transporting Supplies to Aid Communist Bandits; Our Government Closely Monitoring; Director Dong Xian Guang Answers Reporters' Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan held a press conference on the afternoon of the 20th. Director Dong Xian Guang answered various questions as follows:

[Question] Has the Chinese government submitted a report to General Wedemeyer, and what is its content? [Answer] General Wedemeyer's mission to China is to investigate the facts. Therefore, the government regularly provides relevant information on various government activities as needed. The so-called "report" in the question probably refers to the information.

[Question] When will the private business delegation sent by China to Japan arrive?

[Answer] The departure date of the Chinese private business delegation to Japan has not yet been decided.

[Question] There are rumors that Soviet ships are traveling between Lushun (Port Arthur), Dalian, and the Shandong coast, supplying communist areas with goods and military supplies. Does the Director have any information to report on this?

[Answer] Foreign ships are not allowed to navigate the Chinese coast and inland rivers. Dalian is our country's territory, and foreign ships should not use Dalian as a port of entry and exit for navigating along our country's territorial waters. The report mentioned in the question is being closely monitored by our government.

[Question] What is the latest military situation?

[Answer] Except for a 50-kilometer section between Gaomi and Zuoshan, the Jiaoji Railway is entirely in the hands of the national troops. A portion of the communist troops has retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River. The other remnants have fled east to the tip of the Shandong Peninsula. In central Shandong, the national troops have reached Yangjiaogou on the coast of the Bohai Sea, cutting off the communist bandits' supply line between Hebei and eastern Shandong. Liu Bocheng's communist troops, trapped in a corner of western Shandong, attempted to cross the Yellow River northward at Shuhe, but only about a thousand people reached the other side. More than ten thousand surrendered. The remnants, after being reorganized into the new Fourth Column, were again oppressed by the national troops and moved to eastern Henan. Currently, the national troops are pursuing and annihilating them between the Sha River and the Hong River. In northern Shaanxi, the communist strongholds of Suide and Mizhi were successively recovered by the national troops last week. Currently, the main force of the communist bandits in this area, totaling eleven brigades, has retreated to the area between Xian County and Yangbao on the west bank of the Yellow River.

### Wedemeyer Briefly Came to Shanghai; Returned to Nanjing on the Same Day After Completing Unfinished Business

[Our Dispatch] Special Envoy Wedemeyer arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning by special plane. He had lunch with the US Acting Consul General Meyer at noon. In the afternoon, he had some discussions with US personnel in Shanghai. He returned to Nanjing by the same plane at about 5:00 pm.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Wedemeyer, accompanied by translator Captain Wu Hanmin, left Nanjing at 10:00 am on the 20th and flew to Shanghai for a one-day stay to complete matters that he had been unable to conclude in previous visits. He returned to the capital at 7:00 pm amid a sudden downpour. The other members of the delegation remained in Nanjing to study materials and prepare for other appointments in the coming days.

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Wedemeyer's one-day stay in Shanghai on the 20th was to collect information to supplement the report he is preparing to submit to President Truman. Observers believe that he is particularly interested in the reaction in Shanghai to the Chinese government's promulgation of new foreign exchange measures.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to sources close to the Wedemeyer mission, the report currently being rushed by the mission is only a fragment, and is a compilation of various materials. The overall report to be submitted to the US President will have to wait until after returning to Washington. Wedemeyer had been feeling unwell, but has now recovered. It is also said that Wedemeyer has been working diligently every day since arriving in China, without interruption, and even worked until 2:00 am yesterday.

### Abandoning the Northeast: Wedemeyer Mission Does Not Support

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] A significant portion of the information Wedemeyer collected indicates that, from a strictly military point of view, abandoning the Northeast would not be an unwise move. However, other factors mean that the fact-finding Wedemeyer mission cannot realistically support this policy. In addition to military issues, Wedemeyer encountered other facts that could influence the views in his recommendations. The most important of these is that Japan was driven out of the Northeast through American aid.

Sources close to the delegation said Wedemeyer would delay any proposed action that effectively recognized the CCP regime. First, after the U.S. helped Chiang Kai-shek drive the Japanese out of the Northeast, such action would amount to abandoning the Northeast again. Second, according to some observers, such action would effectively place vast regions under the control of a puppet government with potential ties to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, they pointed out that if the U.S. is to assist China in its recovery, the U.S. cannot adopt a policy that prevents the central government from obtaining important northeastern resources such as coal and steel, the lack of which is already severely affecting [the nation]. Other factors Wedemeyer had to give weight to included:

(1) There is no guarantee that if the national troops are able to demarcate and defend a boundary after withdrawing from the Northeast, the communist party will limit its activities to the Northeast.

(2) The current U.S. "anti-communist policy" should be noted.

(3) Past U.S. policies and actions must also be noted, as the Communist Party has not forgotten past U.S. actions. In a recent broadcast, they drew attention to the fact that, at the end of the Sino-Japanese War, Wedemeyer, in his capacity as commander of the China Theater, was responsible for transporting national troops to North China and the Northeast. The CCP declared that since they had expelled the Japanese army from the Northeast, they would certainly be able to drive out American imperialism from the Northeast as well.

### Cultural Circles in Sichuan Suggest Strict Control of Japan

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 19th] Wang Beirong, Xiang Chuanyi and other figures from cultural circles in Sichuan Province submitted a joint letter to Special Envoy Wedemeyer on the 19th, analyzing the current situation and proposing three suggestions: (1) Strictly control Japan and be wary of its resurgence.

Generals Kliher and Wright were both in uniform. After taking photos upon disembarking, they answered questions from reporters on the spot, saying that this was their first visit to China and they were very happy. The mission assigned to them in Japan was to investigate the general situation of Japan, in order to assist the government in preparing for the peace conference and peace treaty with Japan. They have already gained a lot in the past three weeks. According to Brooke, Japan's economic situation is quite poor, especially the lack of fuel, and very few factories are open. However, when asked about the issue of Japanese reparations, he declined to answer. They are scheduled to visit our government leaders on the 21st, pay homage to Chairman Chiang at 5:00 pm in the afternoon, and attend a banquet hosted by Foreign Minister Wang in the evening. On the 22nd, they will attend luncheons and dinners hosted by General Lucas, the head of the US Military Advisory Group, and Minister Bai, respectively. They will attend a reception at the Canadian Embassy in the evening and fly to Guangzhou on the 23rd before returning to Canada via Hong Kong.

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 20th, Kliher asked about the whereabouts of General Sun Liren as soon as he got off the plane, as Sun had met him in the Netherlands and had visited the Canadian First Military Group led by Kliher. Brigadier General Wright and Brooke also arrived on the same plane today. According to the itinerary arranged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the delegation: They will pay homage to Minister Wang Shijie, Minister Bai Chongxi, and President Zhang Qun in the morning of the 21st, and Minister Yu Dawei in the afternoon.

### Suspension of Sale of US Dollar Treasury Bonds; Ministry of Finance Formulates Measures; Those Already Sold Will Be Repaid at the Official Exchange Rate in National Currency

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] United Credit Reporting Agency News: Since the promulgation of the new foreign exchange control measures, regarding whether to continue selling US dollar treasury bonds, the Ministry of Finance has formulated two measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The measures are as follows: (1) No more sales will continue, (2) The 27 million US dollars that have already been sold will still be converted into national currency at the official exchange rate and repaid in installments. It is also learned that the government made this decision because A. The 27 million US dollars sold in recent months is far from the planned target and has no value for resale. B. If the official exchange rate is adjusted after a considerable period of time, if sales continue at the official exchange rate, the government will suffer significant losses in the future when repaying the principal. However, if sales and repayments are made at market prices, it will involve the repayment of principal on US dollar bonds issued in 1938, 1940, and 1942.

### Authoritative Source Says General Elections Will Be Held as Scheduled; Government Has Absolutely Not Considered Postponing

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Recently, there has been much doubt about the government's handling of national general elections, and even speculation about postponing the election. The reporter specifically visited an authoritative source in charge of national election affairs, who said: The government, based on the resolutions of the National Assembly, and in accordance with the constitution, is implementing the preparatory procedures, formulating various constitutional laws and implementing regulations for various election and recall laws as scheduled, and has established a general election office to conduct national election affairs. There has been absolutely no consideration of delaying the election date. Since the first committee meeting was held on June 25, there have been many meetings, starting with the formulation of the procedures for the election of National Assembly representatives and legislators, which were promulgated and implemented. Then, the candidates for the members of the various election offices under its jurisdiction were decided and submitted to the National Government for approval and appointment within a time limit. At the same time, various difficult questions in the laws and technical aspects were examined and explained in detail and circulated for information. At the seventh meeting, it was resolved that the various provincial and municipal governments should be instructed to instruct the various grassroots election offices to announce the various voter lists on the 27th of this month as scheduled (the National Election Office had instructed various localities to prepare for the survey and registration of voters earlier). All of this has been detailed in the newspapers and is known to the whole country, which proves that the government has absolutely not considered postponing the elections. Now, the various election offices under its jurisdiction have reported their establishment one after another. They are actively starting work. The General Office handles an average of more than 100 reports and requests for instructions from the various election offices every day. Judging by the intensity of the work, it can be determined the extent of progress of the national election affairs. Even if a part of the region is disturbed by bandits, methods must be studied and applied to deal with it, in order to overcome difficulties and not affect the progress of the entire election process, so as not to delay the constitutional implementation date solemnly resolved by the National Assembly.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 20th] The Wuhan Election Office was formally established on the 20th.

### The Government Decides to Unify the Currency System; Northeast Circulating Notes Will Enter Customs Territory for Use; Ministry of Economic Affairs to Reward Exports of Bristles and Silk

[Our North China Dispatch, 20th] The central government has resolved to unify the national currency system. This work will begin with adjusting the exchange rate between Northeast circulating notes and the legal tender (法幣) and putting them into use. It is reported that, in order to stabilize the value of the Northeast circulating notes, the government has decided to allow the legal tender to enter customs territory. The relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance have already started planning this measure, and the responsible authorities in the Northeast have also studied it. The preliminary decision is that the exchange rate between the legal tender and the circulating notes will be ten to one. In this way, the Northeast circulating notes will be used both inside and outside customs territory in the status of half the value of customs gold units (關金) (the legal tender and customs gold units are at a ratio of 20:1, circulating note 1 yuan equals half yuan customs gold unit), but the final decision still awaits Zhang Jia'ao's personal inspection of the Northeast. The reorganization of Taiwan currency and Xinjiang currency system have also been included in the central government's currency system reform plan. However, because the needs are not as urgent as those of the Northeast, the implementation is pending.

[Our Nanking Dispatch, 20th] After the promulgation of the new measures for the management of imports and exports, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is making efforts in many ways to reward the export of materials. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry, hog bristles are one of the main export commodities. Due to the differences in hog breeds, climate, and soil quality in China, the quality of the products also varies. Generally speaking, the goods from Chongqing are the best, followed by Hankou, and then Shanghai and Tianjin. In order to promote exports, the Ministry of Economic Affairs first formulated detailed measures for inspection methods, so that the quality can be compared more closely. In terms of silk, the Silk Production and Marketing Association, which is jointly run by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, has recently hired many experts and established a design committee to be responsible for various design works related to silkworm cocoon production and marketing in order to promote business. In addition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is not yet aware of whether the import quota for raw materials for wool textiles will be relaxed.

[Our Nanking Dispatch, 20th] After the promulgation of the new measures for foreign exchange management, some people in the financial community believe that when the government sells more foreign exchange than it receives in a certain period, the legal tender will return too much, the money market will tighten, and it will affect commercial firms. Now, according to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance, this situation may occur, but at least it will not happen in the next six months. Because the government still sets quotas for imported goods and restricts imports, the amount of foreign exchange required for imports is not large. Even in terms of the total amount of import distribution in the third quarter, it is not too large, and the foreign exchange received by the government during the same period can be roughly equal. As for the future, if there is an imbalance, the government will have appropriate countermeasures.

### Taiwan Province's Export Trade Is Expected to Become Gradually Active

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Yan Jia, Director of the Taiwan Finance Department, said: "After the revision of the foreign exchange and import and export trade measures, Taiwan Province's export trade, which has been stagnated for three months, is expected to become gradually active." However, the Bank of Taiwan here still posts prices according to the official price. Each US dollar is equivalent to 179.07 Taiwan dollars. According to the bank, it will start publishing the daily exchange rate after receiving the notice from the Central Bank. In addition, today's market price for US dollars is 715 Taiwan dollars for buying and 730 Taiwan dollars for selling (equivalent to 47.450 legal tender dollars).

[Our North China Dispatch, 20th] The Central Bank's North China branch has not yet been ordered to start posting foreign exchange rates. The person in charge of the National Bank said that the head office may wait until all the specific measures are prepared before sending telegrams to various places to post the rates.

[Our Tientsin Dispatch, 20th] The Tianjin Central Bank has no foreign exchange rates, but the designated operating banks have already started foreign exchange transactions on the 20th. The buying price of US dollars is 40,800 yuan, and the selling price is 42,000 yuan, which is still lower than the black market price. Commodity prices in Tianjin once rose slightly, but now they have returned to a sluggish decline.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 20th] The market here was once chaotic a few days ago, but now it has gradually become clear. Transactions in various industries are sluggish, and prices are generally falling. The market price of goods is 2.4 million yuan per tael, US dollars are traded at market prices, and Vietnamese currency has risen slightly to 1,100 yuan per yuan.

I provide these figures with the intention of explaining the facts and without any critical motivation. The above figures include post-war lend-lease materials, surplus materials, loans from the Export-Import Bank, and relief materials received by the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (行總). The details are as follows: (1) The number of oil pipelines agreed upon was 58,900,000 yuan. The actual value of materials received was US$42,378,827.78. This material is listed under the post-war lend-lease material and is specifically allocated for use after China's victory. (2) The number of surplus materials agreed upon was US$584 million. As of June 30, 1947, the actual value of materials received was US$71.1 million. The United States Overseas Surplus Property Disposal Committee announced on August 1, 1947: "To date, the published value of surplus materials delivered to China is US$170 million." However, according to the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau, this published figure still needs to be carefully reviewed, and as of June 30, 1947, the actual amount received was US$71.1 million. (3) The amount of loans from the Export-Import Bank agreed upon was US$62,550,000, and the actual value of materials received was US$37,525,000. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government has signed five loan agreements with the Export-Import Bank to purchase cotton, power plants, coal mines, and railway equipment, totaling 16 ships. The total amount of these five loans is as mentioned above, US$62,550,000. Currently, except for the ships and cotton, the remaining materials have not been received. (4) The amount of relief materials from the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration agreed upon was US$535 million, and the actual value of materials received was US$410,049,400. The actual value of materials received by the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is calculated at US$200 per ton, so the number is approximately US$410,494,800. According to the China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration figures, as of June 28, 1947, the total amount of materials actually received by China was 2,052,474 tons.

In total, the total amount of post-war rent materials, surplus materials, Export-Import Bank loans, and China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration relief materials, the US aid to China's post-war economic recovery, the total amount agreed upon was US$1,240,450,000, and in the past two years, the total amount of materials actually received was 561,398,672 yuan and 78 cents. The above figures do not include the materials received by the units affiliated to the Ministry of National Defense, which amounted to US$95,437,725.15, and the various expenses for the airlift of troops after the victory over Japan were not included. It may be incidentally stated that, in addition to the United States, Canada is the only country that provided financial assistance to China after World War II. In early 1946, the Canadian government gave China a loan of 60 million Canadian dollars.

### UNRRA Staff's Imprudent Demands Seem to Be Exploited by Others

Director Dong Expresses Two Points of View

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 20th] Director Dong Xianguang of the Executive Yuan's Information Office answered the following questions at a press conference on the afternoon of the 20th: (Question) Some UNRRA personnel who requested the suspension of all materials to China believe that the Chinese government's reply is a rejection of UNRRA's proposal. Does the government agree with this interpretation? (Answer) Of course not. Both the UNRRA office in China and the headquarters in Washington believe that the request of some of its staff is an imprudent move. If the news reports are true, and the majority of UNRRA personnel remaining in China have indeed requested the Central Committee in Washington to suspend all relief materials to China and request the transfer of UNRRA personnel stationed in China, I would like to express two points of view here: It is inappropriate for an official of a United Nations agency to be stationed in a member country and make a public political statement to attack the government of this member country. If more than half of the approximately 500 foreign staff of the UNRRA office in China have simultaneously sent the same telegram, then they seem to have been exploited by some who intend to humiliate the National Government of China in a planned manner. (Question) Regarding UNRRA's proposal to transport relief materials to the war zone north of 34 degrees north latitude, is the Chinese government currently considering further action? (Answer) The Chinese government accepts the recommendations of the UNRRA Central Committee, but with some amendments. It is understood that UNRRA is convening a meeting of the Central Committee to consider China's response. Before the Committee makes a decision, I have nothing to report.

### Overseas Chinese Rubber Factories in Singapore Are Facing a Crisis of Closure

Affected by the Exchange Rate between the Dutch Guilder and the Straits Dollar

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 20th] Twelve rubber factories owned by overseas Chinese here are about to declare closure due to the suspension of the supply of raw rubber from Sumatra. Li Guangqian, chairman of the Overseas Chinese General Chamber of Commerce here, admitted the seriousness of the above situation when he met with reporters this afternoon. He also explained the reason for the suspension of raw rubber imports. Part of the reason is that the Netherlands prohibits transportation along the ports of Sumatra, but the main reason is that the Netherlands controls the exchange rate between the guilder and the Straits dollar. In the black market, one guilder is only worth 20 cents of Straits dollars, while the Netherlands insists on an exchange rate of one guilder for 80 cents of Straits dollars, which is unacceptable to merchants.

### Chinese Physicists Qian Sanqiang and His Wife Invented the Atomic Quadrisection Method; Successful Experiment in France and Published a Report

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 20th] Chinese physicists Qian Sanqiang and his wife, who are studying in France, recently invented the atomic quadrisection method in Paris. According to Henry, the science editor of the Washington Star on July 10, Dr. Qian Sanqiang and Dr. He Zehui of the French Academy in Paris have invented the atomic quadrisection method. His report is published in the "Nature" magazine sponsored by the British Association for the Advancement of Science. The following is a translation of Henry's report: The method of three-part and four-part fission of atomic nuclei has recently been clarified by two Chinese physicists at the French Academy in Paris. This may be the greatest discovery in nuclear physics since the first invention of the fission of uranium atoms in 1939. According to recent reports from here, Dr. Qian Sanqiang and Dr. He Zehui have made a photographic film coated with a solution of uranium, an important starting point for obtaining atomic energy, subjected to neutron bombardment. To this day, experiments have shown that atoms can be split into two parts of almost equal weight at the same time, converting a small amount of the original material into 150 million volts of electricity, making the manufacture of atomic bombs the main key to making it possible, lies in finding a way to make an atom split and then make adjacent atoms split in the same way, thus creating a chain reaction. The above-mentioned two Chinese scientists have recently clearly proved that one out of every 300 atomic fissions can be split into three, each weighing 131, 99, and 5 times that of hydrogen atoms. This weight is different from the weight of any known element. The lightest part is the first of the three kinds of light coins emitted by radium, etc., and the heavier part of the atomic emitter can be regarded as emitted by tin. When the atom is split into three parts, the atomic weight of the lightest part is sometimes nine, which is different from the properties of any known purple. The four-part split of the atom is even rarer. There is only one in every 3,000 splits, and the four parts after the split are also different from any natural element. Qian He's report was published in the "Nature" magazine sponsored by the British Association for the Advancement of Science.

### Editorial: On Levying a Property Donation and Commercial Rights

The idea of levying a one-time property donation, also known as a special construction donation, has been widely circulated for a long time. Recently, reports have indicated that the Ministry of Finance has drafted a plan for the levy of this special donation and will submit it to the National Economic Commission, the Legislative Yuan, the Political Council, and other agencies for discussion and decision, after which it will be finalized, announced, and implemented. After reading this plan, we feel compelled to say a few words.

First of all, we must point out that the country is now in a difficult period. National construction and restoration, mobilization to quell the rebellion, all require funds. After a long period of war, the country's tax base is depleted. To meet the necessary national expenditures, the government has no choice but to broadly seek ways to increase the national treasury. A one-time levy of a special property donation is not necessarily a bad way to manage finances. Moreover, during wartime, there are inevitably those who speculate and profit, becoming suddenly wealthy. These people who have become wealthy through the war environment should fulfill their responsibilities to the country and the people. Although they have had opportunities to donate in the past, such as raising funds for treasury bonds and government bonds, as well as making cash contributions, these have mostly been voluntary and lack any mandatory nature, making them easy to evade. Therefore, at this time, the measure of levying a one-time property donation is, in theory and in principle, a method that should be supported by the entire country. After World War I, Germany and Czechoslovakia faced serious domestic situations, especially economic conditions, and took similar measures. Now, the dangers our country faces are ten or a hundred times greater than those of post-war Europe at that time. Levying a special property donation at this time is not only a financial policy to increase the national treasury but also has profound social effects, allowing the wealth of society to be dedicated to national use, indirectly achieving the goal of equalizing wealth.

However, the term "property donation" or "one-time property tax" really leaves room for consideration. According to the plan drafted by the Ministry of Finance, the explanation of the principles includes the following statement: "The one-time property tax advocated by the general public at present is not an ordinary property tax that levies income generated from property. Property income can be taxed annually, while the one-time property tax targets the property itself and is levied only once." From this, it can be seen that the so-called special construction donation or one-time property tax is fundamentally different from the nature of a general property tax. In terms of its nature, it is really not a general property donation or property tax (General Property Tax), but a capital levy (Capital Levy). Therefore, we believe that "special construction donation" may be a more appropriate term, or it should be called "capital levy" or "asset levy," but not a term like property donation or property tax. Because the levy planned this time, according to the plan drafted by the Ministry of Finance, is clearly not a property tax but targets the property itself, that is, levying a certain portion from the property itself, limited to one time, which is equivalent to levying a certain portion of capital or assets.

Since the assets themselves are the target, we believe that how to levy this special donation is very important. China's statistics and official records have long been deficient in their attention to numbers. Although this trend has changed slightly in recent times and is gradually improving, the incompleteness of statistical figures is undoubtedly suspect. Therefore, attempting to levy this asset or capital at this time will inevitably encounter great difficulties in practice. Therefore, we must give extremely careful consideration to how to levy this special donation. We believe that since this special donation targets the property itself, its levy should naturally target property or assets. Now, the plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance takes the individual as the taxable entity, and we are deeply afraid that if this method is adopted, the people of the whole country, especially the declining aristocratic families, will be restless. As a result, the benefits to the national treasury may not be very effective, and the goal of balancing social wealth may be even more distant.

The plan proposed by the Ministry of Finance states: "The property donation will be levied on individuals whose current value of total property exceeds one billion yuan, with the individual as the tax subject and the following property as the taxable object: (1) land and buildings, (2) deposits and foreign exchange, government bonds and stocks, (3) gold and foreign currency, (4) movable and immovable property of Chinese citizens abroad, (5) the net value of sole proprietorship or partnership business assets, (6) all privately owned means of transportation, (7) machinery and goods." This provision, on the surface, seems very open and aboveboard, but in practice, "the movable and immovable property of Chinese citizens abroad" is not only difficult to estimate, but there must be a very noteworthy portion that has been changed to foreign names, and collection will inevitably face practical difficulties. Therefore, this clause may likely become a dead letter. So, who will be the main payers of the so-called property donation? That is, those who own land and buildings. This is especially obvious in the inland. In our vast inland, most of the aristocratic families of the past own land and buildings. In the social changes of the last thirty years, most of the original aristocratic families have long been holding onto the past. After the Anti-Japanese War, those who have survived are few. Because their property is land and buildings, these land and buildings are difficult to sell and difficult to mortgage to switch to other industries. Therefore, although all their property increases in value with the market price, this is at most a figure on paper, and their actual situation may not be poor and pitiful. If the main target of the special property donation is only these declining aristocratic families, the result may not only fail to enrich the national treasury, but the people will inevitably suffer great disturbances. Moreover, because of the various provisions for secret reports and investigations, it may lead to unscrupulous officials seeking personal gain and engaging in malpractice. The results are unimaginable!

Therefore, we believe that the levy of a special property donation, since it targets the property itself, should take the property itself as the main body, not entirely the individual. Bank account transactions and the capital of companies and firms themselves are sufficient standards for accurate estimation of assets. Rather than levying a property donation on the shareholders of banks, factories, and commercial firms, it would be more convenient and inescapable to levy it directly on the banks, factories, and commercial firms. The assets of individuals are difficult to estimate and collect, while the assets of companies and firms should have records to verify, making it less easy to evade. Therefore, if a property donation is to be levied, which in practice is really an "asset levy," then we believe that the main body of the levy should not be the individual but the property itself.

In short, the levy of a financial donation is not only to increase the national treasury but also to balance social wealth. Those who have property must be able to truly dedicate their property for national use, and only then can the purpose of levying this special donation be achieved. We hope that the government can consider carefully before implementation and execute fairly after implementation.

### Dutch Governor Van Mook Declares: Determined to Retain Occupied Areas; US Formally Withdraws Mediation Proposal

[Our Dispatch] London, 20th (Broadcast): Dutch Acting Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, announced today: The Dutch military will continue to retain the wealthy areas of Sumatra and Madura, which have been occupied since July 21. The reason given was: "These areas have become security zones and should be kept safe." Van Mook also stated: The Netherlands will no longer recognize Indonesia's authority in this regard. Neutral parties should be aware that Van Mook's statement implies that the Dutch will launch a major attack on the Indonesian capital unless the Indonesian side ceases its violations of the "ceasefire."

[United Press, Yogyakarta, 20th] The Indonesian cabinet, anticipating the imminent resumption of large-scale warfare with the Netherlands, held an emergency meeting today to formulate plans to relocate the capital to Sumatra if necessary. Military leaders also attended to discuss various measures to cope with future Dutch offensives. The cabinet's initial action will be to appoint Vice President Hatta, who is currently stationed in Bukittinggi, a mountainous stronghold in northern Sumatra, as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian military, so that he can formally lead the government and the military in the event that President Sukarno is unable to exercise his powers. Earlier, a dispatch from Batavia quoted a Dutch official spokesman as saying that the Dutch military authorities, given the current position which is easy to attack but difficult to defend, have urged the Hague government to authorize an order to attack Yogyakarta.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th (United Press)] The United States has formally withdrawn its proposal to mediate the Indonesian dispute, the State Department said. We believe that our proposal is no longer valid, as Indonesia has twice attached conditions to its response to the US proposal.

### Indonesia Reiterates Position: Still Requests International Arbitration; Jiang Tingfu Proposes a Compromise

[Reuters, Batavia, 20th] The Indonesian government stated to the Security Council today that it cannot accept the Netherlands' proposal to resolve the Indonesian dispute. The telegram stated: If the Dutch government allows the Dutch military to massively violate the ceasefire order and occupy all the territory of the Republic, then the government and people of the Republic will obviously defend themselves by all means. If this happens, a large-scale conflict will inevitably reignite. The telegram finally stated that the Republic specifically requests the Security Council to send a delegation to Indonesia as soon as possible to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire order and to resolve the dispute through an international arbitration commission.

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 19th] Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu today proposed an amendment to Australia's proposal to establish a special Indonesian investigation committee at the Security Council's temporary meeting: (1) Approve the measures suggested by the Dutch, such as consular reports, impartial investigations, and supervision by a country; (2) Ask Batavia and the consular corps to provide reports to the Security Council when necessary, so that the Council can make further considerations on Indonesian matters. Jiang's proposal immediately received the support of US representative Johnson.

### Johnson Refutes Soviet Accusations

Johnson denied Soviet accusations of exerting political pressure on Indonesia to force it to accept US mediation. The Australian representative completely rejected China's amendment, believing that such a solution to the Indonesian issue would be outside the Security Council. The Security Council is scheduled to discuss the Indonesian issue again on the 21st.

The US government has fully agreed to these reductions. US military personnel attached to the Greek army are responsible for administrative management and economic activities. The date of the completion of the British training of the Greek army has not yet been determined.

### Three US Soldiers Stationed in Korea Suddenly Kidnapped by the Soviets; Hodge Lodges Strong Protest

[United Press, Seoul, 20th] An army spokesman announced on the 20th: Three soldiers of the US 32nd Infantry Division were kidnapped by Soviet army personnel on August 12 while conducting routine inspections of telephone lines in a city on the US-Soviet border in Korea. All three soldiers are being held incommunicado. General Hodge has sent two letters of inquiry to Soviet Commander Kolotkov of North Korea, but has not received a response. On the same day, the Soviet commander of the city requested that a US officer bring a translator to negotiate their release. However, after the US officer arrived, he was told that the three men would continue to be tried and could not be released. General Hodge and the US liaison officer in Pyongyang have made efforts to find out where the three men are being held and what crimes they are accused of, but to no avail. It is only known that "this case is being personally handled by Kolotkov." On August 18, Hodge sent a letter stating: "I strongly protest the continued imprisonment of the US soldiers. They were arrested during the day and were wearing US military uniforms." He also pointed out that Soviet soldiers had been arrested in the US zone in the past, but "at your request, they were immediately released."

### Clayton Flies to London Again; To Confer with Cripps on Important Economic Issues; US Loan to Britain Will Soon Be Exhausted

[Reuters, London, 20th] Authoritative sources report that US Undersecretary of State Clayton, who is conducting high-level economic negotiations in Geneva and Paris, is scheduled to fly from Paris to London this morning. He will have lunch with British Trade Minister Sir Stafford Cripps to discuss current matters.

It is not yet known whether Clayton intends to visit Prime Minister Attlee, nor has he scheduled a meeting with Chancellor Dalton. As for Foreign Secretary Bevin, the Foreign Office announced last night that he has returned to London to resume his vacation. Reliable sources report that Clayton's main purpose in this trip is to discuss with Cripps the crisis that the Geneva International Trade Conference has entered. However, the scope of his talks will certainly not be limited to this, as the difficulties faced by Britain in Geneva are fundamentally no different from the difficulties discussed in the dollar crisis talks currently being held in Washington. In other words, they are both the result of the dollar panic caused by the two clauses in the Anglo-American Loan Agreement that do not allow discrimination against imports from the dollar area and require the Bank of England to permanently exchange British pounds for US dollars at a fixed rate.

[United Press, Washington, 20th] The US-British financial meeting entered its third day today. According to diplomatic sources, Britain has temporarily allocated the remaining portion of the $3.75 billion loan to purchase raw materials, food, and machinery before the end of October. Unless a method is found to reduce dollar consumption, it will be forced to use its gold and dollar reserves worth $2.8 billion.

(1) The downstream endpoint is a straight line extending from the end of the Jinpu Bureau's training dike at the Wusongkou, forming a right angle with the center of the river, extending to Pudong, and intersecting with the stone embankment. However, the dredging project of the waterway between this boundary and Shentan, including the training dike related to maintaining the waterway, and the seawall within Shanghai's boundaries, shall also be the responsibility of the Port Authority. (2) The upstream endpoint is the western boundary of Minhang Town. However, within the area reached by the tide of the Huangpu River, extending to areas such as Dianshan Lake, any project along both sides of the river where the tide reaches and related to the river channel is not allowed to be constructed without the approval of the Port Authority.

In the future, revisions will be made with reference to the wharf and warehouse areas stipulated in the urban plan.

A Pimp in a Brothel Arrested, Confesses to Stealing Military Pay, The Madam's Keen Eye:

[Report from our newspaper] Four lavish patrons suddenly arrived at a brothel at No. 65, Fulan Lane, Guizhou Road, yesterday afternoon. Their extravagant behavior aroused suspicion from the madam, who suspected them of being bandits and reported them to the Old Zhabei Police Station. They were arrested and identified as Zhuang Zhonggan, Zhang Mingjun, Sun Yuwei, and Chen Shaoqing. Subsequently, the investigating officer continued to search the rooms of the hotel where they were staying, seizing 8.48 million in legal currency, two gold bracelets, eighteen gold rings, and a considerable amount of other luggage. It was later learned that Zhuang was formerly the second squad leader of the first company of the first battalion of the Fifth Army's Service Department in Yanzhou, Shandong. On July 26, he was ordered by the military to collect military pay in Xuzhou. Taking advantage of the absence of the person in charge of the military supply department, he pried open the wooden boxes and stole 50 million yuan in military pay, fleeing to Shanghai to spend it. As the case involved military personnel stealing, the branch bureau intends to transfer it to the military authorities for punishment.

Case of Impersonating a Female Judge, Zhu Huangfangbai Prosecuted, Her Uncle Once Served as a Puppet Prosecutor:

[Report from our newspaper] The case of Zhu Huangfangbai impersonating a female judge was prosecuted yesterday by the prosecutor for disrupting order. The original text of the indictment is as follows: Zhu Huangfangbai, 25 years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 282, Ji'an Lane, Jinling East Road. Because her uncle, Huang Yan, had served as a prosecutor in the Shanghai Puppet Court during the Japanese occupation, she had a tendency to impersonate a judge and swagger around. At around 9:00 PM on June 28th of this year, she went to the Venus Dance Hall on Madang Road to negotiate as a mediator for her relatives and friends. While sitting alone and sipping tea, she was mistaken for a dancer by patrons Zhou Zhenhua, Shi Jiaping, and others, who considered it an insult to her dignity. She used the name of a judge of this court to report the incident to the police, who took Zhou, Shi, and others to the Songshan Branch Bureau. The news spread and was published in various newspapers in the city. This court, finding no female judge named Zhu Huangfangbai, considered the matter to be disruptive to order and requested an investigation. Although the defendant denied the aforementioned criminal facts during the investigation, she admitted that at around 9:00 PM on June 28th of this year, she went to the Venus Dance Hall and was mistaken for a dancer by patrons, who attempted to solicit her for dancing, and that she reported the incident to the police, who took them to the Songshan Branch Bureau, which was later resolved with an apology from the other party. The fact that she reported the incident to the police using the name of a judge of this court, resulting in the patrons being taken to the bureau, is detailed in various newspapers in the city. Furthermore, the contents of the confidential report and the document from the Haimen Association in Shanghai corroborate each other, and the fact that the defendant openly impersonated the title of a public official is evident. It is in violation of Article 159 of the Criminal Law and is in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and a public prosecution is initiated.

Performing the Eight-Row Dance in the Courtyard, Noble Entertainment, Regulating Body and Mind, The Reasons for the Dance Industry's Petition to the Capital:

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 20th] Zheng Xian, Sun Hongyuan, and other representatives of the Shanghai Dance Industry Association arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 20th to petition the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Interior regarding the ban on dancing. The Executive Yuan was received by Secretary-General Gan, and the Ministry of Social Affairs was received by Chief Secretary Yang Fang. According to Yang, the government's established policy of prohibiting commercial dancing is imperative, but the procedures and methods still need to be carefully considered. The representatives returned to Shanghai on the same day. Furthermore, the contents of the petition submitted by the representatives state that dancing is a noble entertainment, and in ancient China, there were stories of people performing the Eight-Row Dance in the courtyard. Using this as a leisure activity after work can regulate the body and mind and has inherent value and artistic function. It also argues that banning dancing will increase unemployment, affect social order, and reduce tax revenue for the Municipal Finance Bureau, among other reasons.

Rescuing Students Who Have Dropped Out of School, Our Newspaper Organizes Scholarship Fund Again, Establishing Three Groups: Junior High, Senior High, and University, Total Budget Requires 1.05 Billion Yuan:

September 20th of this year marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of this newspaper and the publication of the 25,000th commemorative issue. In addition to preparing for a grand celebration, the colleagues are considering how to do their best to support and encourage young students. After several discussions, it was unanimously agreed that organizing a scholarship fund to help students who have dropped out of school and to cultivate talents for the country is a matter of utmost urgency. The scholarship campaign was originally the most vigorously promoted social relief program by this newspaper during the Anti-Japanese War, lasting for four and a half years. From the first to the ninth sessions, each session rescued students who had dropped out of school, ranging from over a thousand to as many as five thousand, totaling 25,000 people. Their ability to continue their studies and complete their education relied on the continuous advancement of the scholarship campaign. The decision to continue the scholarship program in this newspaper this time was made yesterday at a meeting, where preliminary discussions were held and a preliminary budget was made. It is planned to establish three groups: junior high, senior high, and university. Assuming that 600 students are approved for the junior high group, with a subsidy of 500,000 yuan per student, a total of 300 million yuan is required. Assuming that 500 students are approved for the senior high group, with a subsidy of 700,000 yuan per student, a total of 350 million yuan is required. Assuming that 400 students are approved for the university and specialized school group, with a subsidy of 1 million yuan per student, a total of 400 million yuan is required. According to the above scholarship budget, at least 1.05 billion yuan is required. Some may ask how to raise this amount. This point seems difficult to answer, but in reality, many hands make light work, and many grains of sand make a tower. As long as all people in Shanghai contribute their efforts and money, the expected goal can be achieved in a short period. This newspaper now intends to request Chairman Du Yuesheng to donate 100 million yuan, Vice Chairman Shi Yongkang to donate 50 million yuan, President Pan Gongzhan to donate 50 million yuan, and the colleagues of this newspaper to raise 100 million yuan. With these items budgeted, 300 million yuan can be obtained. The remaining 750 million yuan will be solicited separately by people who are familiar with the situation in various sectors, and a special fundraising team will be formed, divided into two types: honorary team and ordinary team. The former requires 2 million yuan per team, and the latter requires 500,000 yuan, both of which must be raised within one month to meet urgent needs.

[Report from our newspaper] The First Branch of the Hangzhou Municipal Police Bureau recently withdrew funds from the Zhejiang Local Bank, only to find that among the 500,000 yuan in bundles paid by the bank, 5,000 yuan and 500 yuan banknotes were used as 10,000 yuan banknotes.

Random Thoughts in Shanghai: Learning from the British Tenth Son
Having finished reading "A Glimpse of England," one is filled with endless emotions. For the sake of the British Empire's glory, the British people endured seven years of war. Although the Germans were defeated, the power of the British Empire is visibly declining. In Europe and the Far East, the British Empire's flag has had to sadly lower, giving way to nations with expanding power. (You surely know who!)

However, post-war disasters, poverty, and hunger are eroding this nation. The British people have always been steadfast in enduring hardship and not shying away from difficulties. Having weathered a long war, can this new economic crisis and tide of hunger engulf the British people?

Food is scarce, and clothing is tattered. The ration coupons allotted to each person are insufficient to provide a family with warmth and sustenance. A university professor has become gaunt and emaciated, and a famous scholar lives a life of poverty. Parents give all the food they can spare to their children.

The British are weeping and lamenting. Post-war poverty is giving this nation its greatest test. They are not incapable of reaching out for more money, but the more foreign debt they borrow, the more the British Empire's sphere of influence shrinks. Should they greedily pursue temporary comfort and recklessly take on foreign debt? Those gold dollars are like a dose of poison, able to temporarily quench Britain's hunger and thirst, but if the poisoning is too deep, the British Empire will sacrifice its prestige and position. Are they willing to do so?

The British understand this deeply. They would rather everyone tighten their belts and become gaunt and emaciated than bow their heads and reach out to others again!

The gentlemen of the British Isles can maintain this fortitude!

Old Qiu (Churchill) put it well: the British people will surely reach the other shore, and the British nation will not collapse. Watching the British people suffer in tears, we should offer them our utmost respect.

But looking back at China's post-war situation, how much better is it than in Britain? A scene of disaster, a sea of tears. Extravagance and extravagance have not been banned. Mentioning the ban on dancing seems to cause nationwide panic. A banquet costing millions of yuan is considered insufficiently grand. A dress costing three million yuan is still considered shabby. These decadent, ignorant, and clueless people are everywhere.

Poverty and hunger are many times worse than in the British Isles, but the singing and fast melodies in theaters and dance halls cannot cover up the weeping of the entire Chinese people!

Look at the British and take them as our example.

### Free Talk A Glimpse of England Translated by Yang Honglie
"The guarantee of peace and freedom relies on the mutual support and cooperation of Britain and America. The unity of the English-speaking nations is enough to resist any external aggression. Only with military force can there be peace. If we have a dignified and unassailable presence, enemies will not dare to underestimate us."

He firmly holds this view, so he once raised his arms and called for the timely conclusion of a British-American military alliance. He believes that perhaps only strong military force can maintain world peace.

Will Reach the Other Shore
I have heard President Roosevelt express his admiration for Mr. Churchill several times. When I mentioned it, Mr. Churchill led me to an exquisite bookshelf. Mr. Churchill pointed out a card to me with Lincoln's Gettysburg Address printed on it. Below it were the words left by President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill during the Yalta Conference: "I deeply wish to travel further with you and to happily meet again soon." But who knew that the Yalta Conference would be the last meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, and that these words would become a permanent farewell!

"Mr. Churchill!" I said, "Britain is in suffering, and people are saying that only if the whole country is united in hardship and endurance can it overcome the difficulties."

"But, no matter what," he said, "Britain is not a country that can collapse. Having endured countless hardships, it will eventually reach the other shore. Let me show you something else."

He led me to see some designs for floating harbors, the powerful tools that aided the Normandy landings. Nazi military strategists were greatly troubled by these elusive and unpredictable objects.

Included was the related documentation. Initially, the engineering experts reported to the Prime Minister that it was absolutely impossible to design a floating harbor. Next, I saw Mr. Churchill's rough and firm handwriting in the order:

"Don't argue with me, go argue with your difficulties!"

After a long period of research and experimentation, the impossible problem was finally solved, but today Britain is facing a new and dangerous crisis.

As I left Chartwell Manor, I watched the portly figure in the air-raid suit waving goodbye. Under his hand, several masterpieces revered by artists were drawn, and he also commanded the army and navy to march to victory. In the misty evening, I thought that only with courage and perseverance can one move towards light and victory!

Many Post-War Disasters
What are the difficulties in Britain's path to recovery?

I spoke with Mr. Niel, one of the most capable officials in the Labor government, and one of Foreign Secretary Bevin's most trusted aides, about this issue.

Mr. Niel mentioned that millions of dollars in loans had disappeared like flowing water, and that even more dollar aid was needed, but the Labor Party's recovery plan had yet to achieve anything. The expansion of state-owned enterprises had also not benefited government finances. People mostly lamented their hardship, enduring the cold all day long and living a monotonous and dull life. They had been burdened with extremely heavy taxes and rents for seven years, and the situation could not be improved. It was indeed difficult for a country to recover its vitality after the war.

Mr. Niel seemed somewhat surprised and interested in my questions.

"Britain's underground coal reserves are extremely abundant, enough for the whole country to use, but why is it not easy to develop them?"

"Although the number of workers is slowly increasing, the working environment is indeed too harsh. After the mines were nationalized, people thought that the equipment should be modernized. Many people returned to the mines, but production is decreasing day by day. Indeed, many workers are also leaving!"

"Why are workers leaving one after another?"

"Basically, it's because life is too monotonous. A worker who earns a few extra pennies wanders in front of some empty stores. They only feel the pain of having money but nowhere to spend it."

Moreover, after seven years of hard labor, they cannot eat their fill all day long. Post-war there has been widespread disaster, frost and floods, causing us to lose two million sheep - and of course, food and wool are lost along with them. Thirty thousand cattle have also been killed or injured, and 500,000 acres of farmland have been washed away by floods, with 70,000 acres of rice and wheat suffering losses. Eight thousand tons of potatoes were also destroyed along with everything else."

"Your opposition party is talking about how you have painted a vision of a wealthy and prosperous future for all the British people, but I think you would be embarrassed to tell them that hope will turn into nothing."

"We have done our best. We promised the people housing, but after the war, everything needs to be rebuilt, and it is difficult to achieve that at present. The road ahead is full of thorns, and it is possible that rations will be even smaller and life will be even harder in the future. We will openly tell the people to share the difficulties and get through the hard times together!"

To Revive the Nation
Not far from Cambridge University, I met the famous Christian Professor Li Wu. His elderly mother was unable to move due to illness, and the family could not afford to hire another servant. In addition to serving his mother, he also had to take care of household chores. Whenever he had some free time, he would sit down and grade his students' homework.

He talked about how the young people of Britain are working hard in their studies, seeing that their homeland is scarred and that it is their responsibility to revive the nation!

On the Queen Elizabeth, a breeze brought the salty smell of the ocean, unconsciously stirring up a sense of nostalgia, mixed with some inexplicable emotions. I thought of sending three sets of woolen underwear to someone in London, and the recipient received them as if they were treasures, thanking me profusely, followed by a burst of tears. I thought of a group of ragged and thin parents who distributed all their ration coupons to their children, and university professors who are busy with household chores all day long, and then immediately attend to their seriously ill mothers.

Occasionally, I couldn't help but think of an old and familiar country song:

"Compatriots! Arise! Baden said,
Though I am slightly wounded, I am not dead!
Let me lie down and catch my breath for a moment,
Let the fresh blood soak through my shirt,
After a moment,
I will rise up,
And run back to the battlefield!" (End)

Random Notes on America by Xu Shuyuan
In America, traffic police are rarely seen. Traffic lights are automatic, and the automobile class can obey the rules, so traffic police are unnecessary. Municipal authorities can also save an expense. Although Shanghai also has automatic traffic lights, it still relies on the great effort of the police to switch them. In addition, the rickshaw pullers and pedicab drivers are of too low a standard and cannot obey traffic rules, so the police also have to bother to lift their seat cushions. This is a farce in traffic management. In America, it is customary for cars to wait for people. When people cross the road, cars stop and wait for pedestrians to pass. In China, it is people who wait for cars. Looking around to see if there are any cars speeding by, they dare to run across the road like a wild boar. The disregard for traffic rules by our country's automobile class is indirectly disrespectful to traffic police. The alternating time of automatic traffic lights is fixed, so whether you take a car or walk from home to the office, you can calculate the time in advance and will not be squeezed at the corner of the road, waiting for fifteen minutes. When cars pass schools and hospitals, it is customary not to honk their horns. School or hospital authorities erect a warning sign in the middle of the road, usually a small aluminum or wooden figure of a child. You can see a child standing in the middle of the road from afar, with the word "Attention, School" written on it. We know that we are approaching a school and automatically slow down. It is difficult to ensure that children will not cross the road during school hours. This is an unwritten law that car owners automatically abide by and never joke with human lives. In America, it is illegal to cut in front of other cars. Even on wide highways, you cannot cut in front of them at will. American highways have a particularly wide section every few miles. If you want to cut in front, you have to drive to that particularly wide section, and you must honk your horn loudly beforehand to let the cars in front know to be prepared. There is a traffic patrol team on American highways riding motorcycles to investigate those who do not comply with the regulations. The speed limit on the outskirts is 40 miles per hour, 25 miles per hour in the suburbs, 15 miles per hour in the business district, and no more than 5 miles per hour near schools or hospitals. If you violate the regulations and are detected by the patrol team, even if they do not arrest you on the spot, they will copy down your car number, predict where you will pass, and call the patrol station ahead. The police will already be standing in the middle of the road with their motorcycles, blocking your way. If your car passes any important intersection, an undercover traffic policeman will copy down your number. If you hit someone on the highway and think that you have not been seen, you can escape, but the police will compare all the car numbers and passing times, making it impossible for you to deny it. If you try to quibble, they can use various lie detectors to expose you. (42)

Coolness of Early Autumn Compiled by the Newspaper Archives
(Guangxu 21st Year, August 10th)
This summer's climate, although not the hottest, is still miserable in the midst of a housing shortage. Even not being hot is a torment, let alone during the scorching summer. Now that autumn has arrived, the people of Shanghai all hope that the temperature will drop soon. If it could be like it was fifty years ago, everyone would be very happy.

"Since the past ten days, the climate in Shanghai has been extremely hot. Whenever one is in the shade of the paulownia trees, playing chess in the bamboo courtyard, or sitting by a clean desk and bright window, unable to weave due to the heat, one still feels sweat dripping down. Let alone driving a car on a vast road, bearing a long journey... At 2:22 AM on the 18th, it was the Beginning of Autumn solar term. Therefore, those who suffer from the heat are happily rejoicing, saying that from now on they can 'escape from the dust and dirt and cool their souls in Taiwan.' That night, at the third watch of the drum, suddenly there was a sound like a tiger roaring, and the crimson gauze windows shook incessantly. Soon after, there was a clanging sound, and the metal all chimed. The Wind God and Rain Master had already arrived side by side, fully displaying their supernatural powers, sweeping away countless flames of heat in the vast world, which is truly a delightful thing..."

Social Service: Cancer is Mostly of Two Malignant Types
Mr. Huang Meiting:
We have read the letter forwarded to us by the Shen Bao Social Service Department, detailing your symptoms. In principle, we should have answered you sooner, but because there are too many people inquiring, we have been putting it off until now. We are truly uneasy about making you wait so long, please forgive us! We are now answering your questions as follows:

Indeed, as you said, it is uncommon for a 21-year-old youth to have cancer. However, I must tell you that there are two types of cancer. One is the commonly known cancer, Carcinoma, and the other is Sarcoma (muscle tumor?). This type of Sarcoma can occur in childhood and is very malignant. If you have this type, then there is no way to think of it. Regarding the treatment of cancer, there is currently no effective treatment method. So-called radium and X-rays are only a "comparative" type of treatment. We feel very sorry that there is still no effective medicine for the treatment of cancer. However, we very much hope that there may be achievements in the research of atomic energy in the future.

Regarding nutrition, we believe that you can take any kind, as long as it is easily digestible and nutritious enough. We wish you good health!

(2) You are suspected of having chronic appendicitis, and we hope you will seek medical treatment.

### Truman Report: US Financial Budget

[United Press Washington, 20th] President Truman stated in his mid-year budget review tonight: The total government expenditure for this year will be $37 billion, a $500 million decrease from the $37.528 billion estimated in January. When revenues and expenditures are offset at the end of the fiscal year on June 30th of next year, a surplus of $4.7 billion is expected. Due to international issues such as the Marshall Plan for European recovery, which may increase spending, income taxes must remain unchanged and cannot be lowered before the end of June next year.

### Japanese Three Parties Issue Statement: Decide to Support Katayama Cabinet

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Following the Liberal Party's aggressive statement against the Katayama government, the Socialist, Democratic, and National Cooperative Parties, in order to stabilize public sentiment, issued a joint statement stating: Since its establishment, the Katayama Cabinet's policies have consistently followed the four-party policy agreement, advancing towards national salvation with the aim of achieving economic recovery and stabilizing the people's livelihoods. However, the Liberal Party has not shown any cooperation since the Katayama Cabinet was established. The Liberal Party's announcement of the abolition of the four-party policy agreement will have virtually no impact. On the contrary, with the Liberal Party's stance clarified, the dark clouds in Japanese political circles can be swept away.
