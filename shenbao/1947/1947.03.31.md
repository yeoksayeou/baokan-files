### Regarding the Ten Constitutional Laws, Legislative Procedures Are Fully Completed, There Will Be Two Hundred and Twenty-Three National Supervisory Committee Members

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Regarding the ten constitutional laws, after the Legislative Yuan devoted nearly a week, regardless of holidays or vacations, to careful discussions, the legislative procedures were fully completed at 8 p.m. on the 30th. When President Sun announced that this arduous task had been successfully completed through the efforts of all members, the entire Yuan responded with enthusiastic applause. After the National Government promulgates the order on April 1st, it will become the most important decree for implementing constitutional government.

Of these laws, four are election and recall laws, and six are organization laws. The National Assembly Organization Law was completed first, on the 25th. The National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law and the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Election and Recall Law were passed on the 28th. On the morning of the 30th, the discussion of the Legislative Yuan Election and Recall Law continued. Minister of the Interior Zhang Lisheng attended and explained the compilation of population statistics and the division of electoral districts, admitting that obtaining accurate statistical figures was indeed not easy. He himself did not insist on his own views on this matter. Regarding the division of districts, Zhang explained that he was ordered to handle this matter with a deadline of only three days, so errors were inevitable, and he was very willing to accept opinions from all sides. Then, the clauses were discussed one by one. The main point of amendment was to reduce the number of nominators for legislative candidates from 5,000 to 3,000. The original resolution that the current legislators would be natural candidates for the next term was deleted. Regarding the point that current civil and military officials should not elect people in their jurisdiction or place of service, Deng Gongli Xuan and others also put forward valuable opinions. It was resolved that such personnel who wish to be candidates must resign five months before the election period. In addition, regarding occupational representatives, Sun Jiulu and others advocated that occupational representative candidates should be limited to the rapid fire staff members of each occupation to prevent manipulation and impersonation, which was also passed by a majority. Regarding the issue of recalling legislators, some legislators believed that the number of recalls should not be too many. President Sun also believed that legislators would not necessarily commit any wrongdoings, and limiting the number of applications for recall could prevent the administrative authorities from interfering with the legislature. The entire case completed the legislative process at 12:15 p.m.

Next, the draft Supervisory Committee Election and Recall Law was discussed. In less than an hour, all 24 articles of the entire case were passed. The law stipulates that there will be 223 supervisory committee members nationwide, elected by the provincial and municipal councils, the Mongolian and Tibetan local councils, and overseas Chinese groups. Each province can elect five members, each municipality two, each Mongolian League a total of eight, Tibet eight, and overseas Chinese eight. The Supervisory Committee election mechanism was changed from an election committee system to an election supervision system.

### New Organization Law of the Executive Yuan Stipulates the Establishment of Fourteen Ministries and Three Committees Cancels the Ministry of Food and the Supreme Court

Then, the draft organization law of the five Yuans was discussed at a rapid pace. The most significant changes included the Executive Yuan abolishing the Ministry of Social Affairs and changing it to the Ministry of Labor. The Ministry of Food was also abolished, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was changed to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Judicial Administration was placed under the Executive Yuan, the Supreme Court was abolished, the Examination Yuan established the Ministry of Personnel and the Examination Office, the Supervisory Yuan abolished the Office of the Supervisory Commissioner and the Supervisory Commissioner, and the Audit Department was renamed the General Audit Office.

According to the new Executive Yuan Organization Law, the Executive Yuan will have fourteen ministries and three committees. The heads of each ministry and committee will be political affairs committee members, and there will be five to seven political affairs committee members without portfolio. The fourteen ministries are the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Judicial Administration, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Water Conservancy, Ministry of Land Administration, and Ministry of Health. Regarding the proposal to abolish the Ministry of Social Affairs, Mr. Zhong pointed out that the Ministry of Social Affairs had been too neglectful of the welfare of farmers and workers in the past, so the ministry should be abolished and the Ministry of Labor established. The newly elected legislator Wu Wentian spoke for the first time, stating that the Ministry of Social Affairs had not done what it should have done, and only emphasized superficial work such as group weddings, which inevitably gave people the suspicion of incompetence. When the vote was taken, the abolition of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the establishment of the Ministry of Labor was passed by the largest majority. Regarding the affiliation of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Constitutional Law Committee decided during a meeting to place the ministry under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan. President Sun reported on the process of discussing this issue at the Political Consultative Conference and the National Assembly, and explained it in detail according to the Constitution, believing that the ministry should not belong to the Executive Yuan to avoid conflicting with the Constitution. Lin Bin and others put forward reasons for judicial independence and, based on the provisions of Article 82 of the Constitution, advocated that the Ministry of Judicial Administration should belong to the Judicial Yuan. It was resolved that the ministry should still belong to the Executive Yuan. Rui Yifu spoke, suggesting that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission should be changed to the Ministry of Border Affairs. Zhao Pei seconded the motion. President Sun also pointed out that the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee had made this resolution, but it received too few votes when the vote was taken, so the original plan was maintained. In addition, during the preliminary review, some people suggested merging the Resources Committee into the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and some advocated renaming it the Ministry of Heavy Industry, but it still exists independently. Furthermore, the Counsellor's Office organization was decided to be abolished, with only eight to ten counsellors. The full text of the Executive Yuan Organization Law, with sixteen articles, from proposal to passage, took less than two hours, which can be said to be extremely fast.

Legislative Yuan Establishes Seventeen Committees

After the draft Executive Yuan Organization Law was passed, the other four organization laws were passed quickly. Among them, the Legislative Yuan Organization Law was discussed for only 25 minutes. The main amendment was to increase the number of Legislative Yuan committees to seventeen, namely the Internal Affairs Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee, National Defense Committee, Economic Committee, Finance Committee, Budget Committee, Education Committee, Culture Committee, Agriculture and Forestry Committee, Transportation Committee, Social Affairs Committee, Land Administration Committee, Border Affairs Committee, Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Civil Law Committee, Criminal Law Committee, Commercial Law Committee, and Legal System Committee.

Judicial Yuan Establishes a Grand Justice Conference

When discussing the Judicial Yuan Organization Law, the system of Grand Justices caused a heated debate. When the Constitutional Law Committee reviewed it, it was decided that the Judicial Yuan would establish a Grand Justice Conference, organized by nine Grand Justices, to exercise the power to interpret the Constitution and unify the interpretation of laws and decrees. The conference would elect one person as chairman, and the President of the Judicial Yuan should attend. The term of office of the Grand Justices was set at six years, and their qualifications would be determined separately by law. During the discussion, President Sun and others believed that the Constitution did not stipulate the term of office of the Grand Justices, and whether the President of the Judicial Yuan was a natural Grand Justice was indeed a problem. However, if the President of the Judicial Yuan did not attend the Grand Justice Conference, it seemed inappropriate in terms of legal principles. Liu Ke ã€€believed that if the President of the Judicial Yuan was a Grand Justice, it seemed to be an administrative interference. It was resolved that the organization law would not explicitly stipulate the term of office of the Grand Justices, and it would be left to the Judicial Yuan to interpret it in the future. As for whether the President of the Judicial Yuan was a Grand Justice, it was not stipulated in the meeting. It was only decided that "the President of the Judicial Yuan will be the chairman when the Grand Justice Conference is held," and the number of Grand Justices was set at nine. Furthermore, the Supreme Court will be abolished, and civil courts, criminal courts, administrative trial courts, Public Servant Disciplinary Committee and the Ministry of Judicial Administration will be established in the Judicial Yuan. In the future, appeals will be handled by the civil and criminal courts, which is also a major reform.

No Major Changes to the Examination Yuan Organization

The new Examination Yuan Organization Law does not have major changes compared to the current organization law. According to the new organization law, the Yuan will set up a Committee for Examinations and Discipline with eleven members, with a term of six years. The Examination Yuan Conference will be organized by the President, Vice-President, and Examination Committee members to comprehensively plan matters related to examinations. The Examination Yuan will establish the Ministry of Personnel and the Examination Office. The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the Examination Yuan will be six years. The original draft of the National Defense Council had a provision to replace it with the Civil Servant Protection Committee. The review cancelled this provision.

Supervisory Yuan Abolishes the Office of Supervisory Commissioner

When the draft Supervisory Yuan Organization Law was finally discussed, it was 7:30 p.m. The legislators ate snacks while discussing the articles one by one, without any fatigue. The most important change was the abolition of the Office of Supervisory Commissioner and the Supervisory Commissioner. President Sun pointed out that the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan are public opinion organs. The Supervisory Yuan is equivalent to the upper house of a foreign country and is not an official government office. Supervisory committee members are elected by local public opinion organs and should not be subject to appointment or dismissal by the government. Peng Chunshi opposed the establishment of Supervisory Commissioners. His reason was that as a member of the Supervisory Committee, everyone has the power to impeach and censure, so there is no need to establish so-called Supervisory Commissioners. It was resolved that the provisions be changed to Supervisory Committee members can go to various places to conduct roving supervision and exercise the power of impeachment and censure. Another important amendment in the organization law was that the Audit Department was changed to the General Audit Office. The Supervisory Yuan suggested establishing an investigation office, but the review decided not to establish it.

After all the laws and regulations completed the legislative process amidst applause, the reporters went to the podium and asked President Sun to give a brief speech on the matter. Sun was extremely tired after days of meetings (Sun was also the president of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association). When talking to reporters, he stroked his forehead with his hand and said: "We have been holding meetings for days, and I am extremely tired. The Legislative Yuan colleagues have completed the first difficult task in a very short period of time. Their spirit of hard work is worthy of praise."

### Youth Party Government Committee List Zuo Shunsheng Said That It May Be Agreed Today, The Democratic Socialist Party List Has Not Yet Been Submitted Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] All 15 members of the Standing Committee of the Youth Party held a forum at Zuo Shunsheng's residence yesterday afternoon to extensively exchange views on the issue of participating in the government. After the meeting, Zuo told reporters: Whether the Youth Party's list of government committee members and the Executive Yuan list will be submitted at once or submitted one after another is still under consideration, and the candidates are also being studied. Only opinions were exchanged on the 30th, and no conclusions were reached. A standing committee meeting will be held on the 31st, and a decision should be made. Zuo also said: The Youth Party hopes to reach an understanding with the government on the issue of opening up local political power before nominating a list, but this point has not been finalized and will be negotiated in Beijing again in the future. As far as the reorganization of the Executive Yuan is concerned, the Youth Party hopes to participate in more political ministries and fewer technical ministries, such as the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the Ministry of Health, because the government's technical talents are already sufficient and there is no need to seek them from other parties. At the same time, the reorganization of the government itself is political. Regarding the rumor that the Youth Party will launch a thousand people to participate in the government, Zuo resolutely denied it. The reporter asked Zuo about the explanation of "traffic recovery", and Zuo replied: My personal opinion is that negotiations with the Communist Party can only be resumed after every railway in the country is opened.

[Also] Secretary-General Lei Zhen visited the Youth Party Office on Haige Road yesterday and had some discussions. He stayed in Shanghai yesterday.

[Our Newspaper] The list of government committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet been submitted yesterday. According to a senior official, it is necessary to wait for the standing committee members in Beijing to return to Shanghai for consultation before a decision can be made. The current negotiations in Beijing and the submission of the list of government committee members are one matter and cannot be separated. The reorganization of local governments is very important, otherwise the simple reorganization of the central government will be meaningless. As for the rumor that some people in the party require that the implementation of the common program be guaranteed before a list can be submitted, it is indeed inaccurate, because since it is called a common program, it should be believed and abided by together. If this cannot be trusted, what other method can guarantee its implementation?

### The National Defense Committee Will End Soon Wang Chonghui Said That He Is Old and Needs to Rest

[Central News Agency, this city] Wang Chonghui, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Committee, came to Shanghai from ã€€the other day and told reporters yesterday: The Supreme National Defense Committee has been ordered to be abolished, and it will end as soon as the reorganization of the National Committee is completed. At that time, the functions of this committee will be managed separately by the Central Political Committee and the National Government Committee. Wang said: He has long intended to retire because he is old and urgently needs to rest. After returning to Beijing next month and completing the closing affairs of the Supreme National Defense Committee, he will consider advancing or retreating again.

### National Army Advances in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia: Longdong Forces Advance North from Qingyang, Threatening Huanxian; Fierce Fighting Erupts on the Shaanxi-Ningxia Border

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 30th] Qingyang, Longdong, advances north towards Huanjiang. On the 28th, they crossed Quzizhen and are now pressing on the outskirts of Huanxian. The main force of the Communist army's Longdong Military Sub-district, including the Yingbei Brigade and the Cavalry Security Column, is concentrated in Xiaoguan.

The three brigades of Communist army defenders in the city, commanded by Gao Zili, are luring the National Army into a deeper advance.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 29th] The number of residents returning to Yan'an continues to increase. From the 25th to the 28th alone, 15,000 refugees registered to return. Hu Zongnan distributed 5,000 yuan to large families and 2,000 yuan to small families as a sign of concern. The Yan'an County Government is actively organizing the baojia system (a system of household registration and collective responsibility) to prevent spies from infiltrating. Furthermore, the New Fourth Brigade of the Communist army, which suffered a defeat at An'sai, is now fleeing to Longpanzhen, 35 kilometers directly north of Yan'an. A portion of the Second Security Brigade and the New Eleventh Brigade are fleeing west towards Bao'an. On the night of the 27th, the Communist Party held a joint meeting of party, government, and military officials in Wayaobao. It is reported that the following resolutions were made: (1) Mobilize all political workers to go deep into the company-level and lower-level cadres to conduct propaganda; (2) Before reinforcements arrive, temporarily defend the current strongholds and make every effort to exhaust the "enemy" forces; (3) Incorporate the militia and their weapons into the regular army.

[Special Dispatch from Taiyuan, 29th] The current stage of the Northwest war situation will temporarily be deadlocked in northern Shaanxi. The National Army has captured Hengshan, and the main force of the Communist army is concentrated in the Wayaobao, Suide, and Qingrun areas. Northwestern Shanxi is the area where the Communist army is preparing to retreat to first. After the recovery of Huairen in northern Shanxi, the National Army in Yingxian, which had been defending for ten months, is no longer isolated, and the threat to the southern side of the Datong-Puzhou Railway in Shanxi has been completely eliminated.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 30th] The National Army in Yingxian, northern Shanxi, has been besieged for over a year. They are now out of grain and are eating horse carcasses, urgently awaiting outside assistance.

[Special Dispatch from Taiyuan, 30th] The Communist army has suffered repeated defeats in northern Shaanxi and has decided to strengthen the underground army. They have established the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Underground Army Command in Jin Province (Shanxi), with command posts established at various crossings of the Yellow River. They are also stepping up the replenishment of troops in Shanxi, conscripting over a thousand militiamen from the Linfen border area and forcibly forming them into the Second Garrison Regiment. It is rumored that over 30,000 troops from the defeated and scattered 358th and 359th Brigades crossed the Yellow River via Jun Ferry and arrived in Liulinzhen. On the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd, over 10,000 Communist troops crossed east to Baode and scattered to Xingxian, Lanxian, and Pianguan. The remnants of Wang Zhen's five regiments retreated to Xishiwanzhen, west of Mizhi, for reorganization. The Communist troops near Wayaobao, numbering over 3,000, are moving south to prevent the unarmed National Army from advancing north. The National Army captured the important town of Kaishan between Wenshui and Jiaocheng on the afternoon of the 29th, as well as Hongxiang and Guangxing. The Communist troops fled to the western mountains.

### Constitutional Promotion Committee: Passes Detailed Rules of Procedure; General Assembly Today Will Discuss Proposals

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 30th] The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee held a meeting on the 30th. A review session was held in the morning, followed by a general assembly in the afternoon. The committee's detailed rules of procedure and organizational regulations were both passed. On the 31st, proposals will be discussed, and the review of various constitutional regulations will begin. The review session on the morning of the 30th was convened by Mo Dehui. The agenda was as follows: (1) Review the detailed rules of procedure, decide on three amendments, and submit them to the general assembly for discussion. (2) Study the committee's organizational regulations. Finally, Xi Yuyu proposed that the committee should have time to review various regulations, and he hoped that the government would delay the promulgation of official orders. The committee members spoke enthusiastically, believing that if the committee could not review regulations, it would be a mere formality. Especially given the urgency of the time, the Legislative Yuan should bear the responsibility. However, after a final vote, it was still decided that, in addition to carrying out the review, the government should not be asked to delay the promulgation of laws and regulations. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 30th] The important proposals of the members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee are as follows: (1) Establish a standing committee within the Standing Committee, with a number of members ranging from 21 to 25, proposed by Liu Siying and others from the Youth Party.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 30th] The Director of the Baoding-Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, Sun Lianzhong, returned to Beiping yesterday from Baoding. He went to the headquarters to work this morning and met with reporters, saying: (1) The northern section of the Beihan Railway is currently peaceful. The National Army in various places is busy helping farmers with spring plowing. After repeated defeats recently, the Communist army has not only suffered heavy casualties, but many soldiers have also deserted. Therefore, its 17 brigades have been divided into two groups for reorganization, one group retreating to Jicheping in Hebei, and the other group being transferred east to the Hejian-Renqiu area in central Hebei. (2) The area within 50 li south of Baoding is completely under the control of the National Army. Clearing the Baoding-Shijiazhuang transportation route has not yet been put into practice, because the road repair materials for that section are not yet fully prepared, even if it is cleared, it will still not be passable. Recently, the National Army has purchased back many railway tracks from the people in the recovered areas of Mancheng, Dingxian, etc., at a price of 20,000 yuan per track. (3) The order in the areas recovered by the National Army is gradually recovering. Taking Mancheng as an example, when the Communist army withdrew from the area, it only left two or three old women. Now, the number of people returning is increasing, reaching more than 1,700 households. Trade between rural areas and cities and between cities of different sizes has also resumed. Currently, merchants and travelers are bustling back and forth on the Baoding-Mancheng road, and the recovered area is gradually recovering.

At that time, he faced the map on the wall and explained the current military situation in Hebei Province to the reporters, saying: The entire front line is peaceful and quiet. The Communist army's flight in northern Shaanxi has no direct impact on the situation in Hebei. The war in Hebei Province will be shifted to management. The National Army advancing north along the Jinpu Railway will capture Tai'an in the near future, and the recovery of Dezhou will be as easy as turning one's hand. The clearance of the Jinpu Railway will not be difficult to achieve in the near future.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association

The Standing, Research, Investigation, and Propaganda Committees of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association held their inaugural meetings in the capital on the 29th and began to carry out their tasks to promote constitutional government. These four committees were established after the adjournment of the National Assembly to prepare for the implementation of constitutionalism. Not only are their tasks important, but whether their work is completed well has a very close relationship with the constitutionalism that China will implement in the future. Moreover, judging from the composition of their members, they are organized by the Kuomintang, the Social Democratic Party, the Youth Party, and social elites, which is different from the nature of a partisan meeting and a general organization. Therefore, we, the common people, are extremely hopeful for the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association today, seeing representatives of various parties and social elites gathered together to calmly discuss the preparations necessary for the implementation of constitutionalism and to review all the regulations submitted by the Legislative Yuan regarding the implementation of constitutionalism. As President Chiang stated in his telegram to the Association, "Although a complete constitution has been drafted, how to ensure its smooth and unimpeded implementation in the future is the most important preparation work at present." "It is hoped that the Association will work together to advance and complete this great undertaking as scheduled."

The Constitution of the Republic of China was implemented on December 25th of last year, so this year is truly a "Constitutional Preparation Year," which is also the transition period from the Kuomintang's end of tutelage to the implementation of constitutional government. This year can be said to be the most important year, and the future of China's democratic politics depends entirely on whether the preparatory work this year is sufficient! However, more than three months have passed since the promulgation of the Constitution. How should we make full use of these eight months or so to fully prepare for the arduous task of implementing constitutionalism? This is the most urgent issue at present. The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association has just been established, and the preparatory work is complicated. It is really a very difficult thing to complete such a great task in eight months or so. We would like to briefly describe some of our views for the reference of the gentlemen of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association.

First, according to the procedures for preparing for implementation as stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of China, the following tasks must also be completed in the legislative aspect: (1) Existing laws and regulations that conflict with the Constitution should be promptly amended or abolished separately. (2) Within three months after the promulgation of the Constitution, five types of laws must be formulated and promulgated: (1) Regarding the organization of the National Assembly and the election and recall of representatives of the National Assembly; (2) Regarding the election and recall of the President and Vice President; (3) Regarding the election and recall of members of the Legislative Yuan; (4) Regarding the election and recall of members of the Control Yuan; (5) Regarding the organization of the five Yuan. Although these legislative tasks fall within the scope of the Legislative Yuan's powers, how to urge the Legislative Yuan to complete the above laws as scheduled? What principles should be adopted for the legislation of the above regulations? These are all tasks of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. And when we review the recent legislative work of the Legislative Yuan, the laws that have been passed include the Organic Law of the National Assembly, the Election and Recall Law of Representatives of the National Assembly, and the Election and Recall Law of the President and Vice President. There are still several laws that have not been drafted. As of today, counting from the date of the promulgation of the Constitution, it has been exactly three months, and it is an undeniable fact that it has failed to fully complete its legislative work as scheduled in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. As for the content of these laws? Are the methods adopted practical and easy to implement? There is a need to carefully study them. Although the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association does not bear actual responsibility, it should still review them so that these regulations can better adapt to the current environment and be easier to implement.

Second, so-called constitutionalism cannot completely rely on the constitution or laws. The most important thing is how the government and the people use them. In other words, even if there is a perfect constitution and good laws, if the government cannot implement the constitution and enforce the laws, and the people cannot abide by the constitution and laws, then so-called constitutionalism is still empty talk. Therefore, regarding the implementation of constitutionalism, in addition to making full preparations in terms of legal principles, a renovation work is also needed in the psychology of the people to cultivate a democratic atmosphere so that the people of the whole country can welcome and love democracy! Only in this way can China's politics embark on the path of true democracy. Otherwise, the constitution is the constitution, and politics is politics. The constitution and politics are disconnected, and it is only a decoration and a self-deception. Therefore, we have repeatedly advocated that this year's transition period is a period for our country to learn democracy from top to bottom. We would rather learn and progress gradually step by step, and we must not be ambitious and attempt to make a splash. We want to race with others just when we are learning to walk, because the development process of democratic politics in various countries in the world is the result of natural development. Let me first examine myself. China's political philosophy has always advocated rule by ritual and despised rule by law since ancient times. Although democratic ideas sprouted early, they were bound by inherited traditional concepts and failed to develop freely. It has become a country with relatively backward democratic politics. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, was aware of this, so he invented the period of political tutelage. The so-called political tutelage, in a nutshell, is to guide the people to learn democracy. However, since the Kuomintang successfully unified the country through the Northern Expedition, it has been under political tutelage for more than 20 years. Due to the pressure of internal and external troubles, it failed to achieve the intended goals of the political tutelage period. But today, whether it is the trend of the world or the aspirations of the people in the country, political tutelage must end, and constitutional government must be implemented. At this time, it is really the last period for our people to learn democracy and should be especially cherished. I hope that before the implementation of constitutional government on December 25th of this year, we can make full preparations to avoid failure!

Third, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association is jointly organized by the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and social elites, and can be regarded as a party meeting. Moreover, we have seen that the members of each party are all outstanding members of their respective parties. If we want to expect this association to complete its task to promote the implementation of constitutionalism in China, then we must first hope that it itself is a group full of democratic spirit. Regardless of whether it bears actual responsibility or is just a research and investigation agency, it must ultimately appear before the people of the whole country in the form of a democratic group, as a model for the people and an example for the people. But what we call democratic spirit, the most important thing is that the leaders of each party have the demeanor of democratic politicians, being humble, without prejudice, selfless, and able to look at the big picture and plan for the big picture. Anything that is conducive to the implementation of constitutionalism, regardless of the opinions of the parties, should be supported and assisted in its success. Conversely, anything that is harmful to the development of democracy in China, no matter how beneficial it is to the party, should still be resolutely opposed. Only in this way can China's democratic politics have a bright future, and the disputes between parties will not become an obstacle to democracy. However, when we face the current situation, we cannot but be apprehensive in our hearts, and we always feel that some party leaders are indecisive and hesitant before making a final decision; even after the decision is made, they are still worried about gains and losses; they want to move forward but do not advance, which is really the most pessimistic phenomenon at present. Taking the reorganization of the government as an example, three months have already been wasted, and the list of parties participating in the government has not yet been submitted, which makes us cannot but regret!

In short, the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association is a party meeting during the transition period, and it should give full play to its role to achieve its great cause of preparing for constitutional government!

### Agenda Determined for Foreign Ministers' Conference - Major German Issues to Be Discussed Within a Deadline - Chairman of the Reparations Committee States Difficulties in Work

[United Press, Moscow, 29th] Under pressure from US Secretary of State Marshall, the four foreign ministers, after a short meeting today, agreed to discuss two major issues in the two-stage talks that will begin next Monday: (1) Germany as an economic unit, including reparations, and a review of industrial standards, including restrictions on military industries; (2) The form and scope of the German Provisional Government. The discussion of the above two issues must be completed by April 2 at the latest. If a common ground cannot be reached, then the fate of the conference has been sealed as far as the German issue is concerned. Authoritative sources say that if Marshall's strategy of focusing on the most urgent German issues does not make progress, there is ample reason to believe that he will pack his bags and return home. Conversely, if the thorough efforts at the beginning of next week reveal some constructive prospects, Marshall may propose another deadline to resolve other disputes as the conference continues. In addition, the four foreign ministers also appointed a special subcommittee to discuss minor issues (German political democratization, denazification, population transfer, refugees, etc.) and draft regulations by April 3. The US representative to the committee is Marshall's economic advisor Mason, the French representative is Alphand, the British representative is Lawberson, and the Soviet representative is General Sokolovsky. Regarding the issue of a unified Germany, the prospects for reaching an agreement are not good. It is heard that the US delegation is willing to make some concessions to the Soviet Union on the issue of using Germany's current production for reparations, but in exchange for the Soviet Union's compromise on the issue of German political power. It remains to be seen whether the Soviet Union will accept this compromise.

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] When the Foreign Ministers' Conference on German issues opened this morning, Allied Reparations Committee Chairman Luais reported on the administrative difficulties of the committee. He pointed out that the member governments were dissatisfied with the progress of the distribution of reparations, and the member governments hoped to quickly resume the delivery of reparations. If the current situation continues, it will completely fail the reparations plan stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. He suggested that the Reparations Committee should report directly to the Foreign Ministers' Conference so that it could provide advice directly to the Foreign Ministers' Conference without going through the German Control Council. He also pointed out that the regulations on emergency payment of reparations have been repeatedly violated, and the original intention of the Potsdam Agreement has been completely ignored. He said that the reasons why the Potsdam reparations policy cannot be implemented are, firstly, the political orders that everyone knows, and secondly, the administrative orders that are not well known, the latter being even more important than the former.

### British and Soviet Union Negotiate Amendments to Alliance Treaty

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky, Goronsky, British Ambassador Peterson, and Assistant Foreign Minister Hart held the first negotiation on amending the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty at the Soviet Foreign Ministry on Thursday. The two sides held a second meeting yesterday. A British spokesman said that he hoped that the negotiations could be completed before the end of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is reported that the main proposals of both sides for amending the alliance treaty are as follows: The Soviet Union hopes to amend Article 4 of the alliance treaty, that is, the provisions for mutual assistance between Britain and the Soviet Union when Germany launches an aggression, so that this obligation does not have to depend on the obligations stipulated by the United Nations organization. The British side requires that the validity period of the alliance treaty be extended from 20 years to 50 years. According to this negotiation, it is the result of the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Stalin earlier this week. If the treaty is negotiated and agreed upon, it will be submitted to Stalin again before Bevin leaves Moscow.

### Reviewing and Completing Report on Austrian Peace Treaty

The Issue of German Property in Austria Remains to Be Discussed

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 29th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference today completed its report to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, stating that of the 35 articles of the Austrian Peace Treaty, 24 have been agreed upon, and 7 are still under discussion and will continue to be discussed on April 1. As for the most difficult issue, namely the definition of German property in Austria, the Foreign Ministers' Conference has not yet drafted a report.

### Franco-Soviet Dignitaries Gather

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 29th] French Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Mrs. Jadru hosted a banquet tonight to entertain Soviet Foreign Minister and Mrs. Molotov, French Foreign Minister and Mrs. Bidault, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Mrs. Vyshinsky, Mr. and Mrs. Gusev, Soviet Commander-in-Chief in Germany Marshal Sokolovsky, French Commander-in-Chief in Germany General Koenig, French representatives Merville, Alphand, and Hasson.

### American Radio Station in Munich Sabotaged - Russian-Language Programs Broadcast to South America

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Assistant Secretary of State Banden revealed: A special advisor to the State Department stationed in Munich informed the State Department that the button of the American relay station in Munich was turned, causing the radio waves originally intended to be broadcast to the Soviet Union to be directed to South America. The authorities are now thoroughly investigating this case to avoid similar incidents from happening again. The Munich relay station has six antennas, two of which are used for broadcasting to the Soviet Union. One of them was being used to test a new wavelength for broadcasting to the Soviet Union, but it lost its effectiveness between March 17 and 25. It was only discovered that it had been sabotaged and was corrected on March 25.

### Germans in the Ruhr Continue Hunger Demonstration

[Reuters, Dortmund, Ruhr Area, 29th] There were more German demonstrations here today due to food shortages. Local miners' union secretary Keilhof addressed the protesters, suggesting launching a one-day collective hunger demonstration by all trade unions in the entire British military district. The protesters were received by Major Wilson, the local British military commander, who said that the wheat supply would improve in the coming days. The Dortmund Food Bureau chief said that flour could arrive late on the weekend, and representatives of factories and consumers could attend the city council meeting next Tuesday to present their food opinions.

### Turkish Prime Minister Reprimands Communism

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 29th Dispatch] Turkish Prime Minister Burke recently delivered a moving speech to students at Istanbul University, attacking extremists on both the left and right and strongly advocating the middle way. He attacked the extreme right-wing Pan-Turkism, which advocates uniting Turkish-Anatolia-Soviet-Central Asia and Northwest China into a large Turkish country. Burke said: Racial nationalism is a complete violation of democracy and is irrational and imperialistic. He spoke of communism, saying: Communist parties in every country are eroding their national institutions. They conceal their destruction of national self-consciousness with the sugarcoating of democratic socialism. We should guard against people who cooperate with foreign countries. All Turks should take national unity and integrity as the basic principles of the country. Communism denies nationalism, and racialism exaggerates nationalism, so an effective remedy is a clear sense of nationalism. Turks are not selfish and despise others. On the contrary, Turkish citizens should support international organizations and strive for the unity of civilized countries.

### Investigation Committee on Anti-American Activities Proves: American Communist Party Obeys Soviet Union

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The House Un-American Activities Committee today revealed evidence proving that the American Communist Party is a spy for the Soviet government. Among the evidence is an order issued by the Communist International in 1927 to the American Communist Party to oppose the American imperialist counter-revolutionary war in China. In total, ninety-two instructions issued by Moscow influencing the activities of the American Communist Party have been disclosed. Representative Thomas, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, frankly told reporters that, based on the report released this time, it can be proved that the American Communist Party is undoubtedly Moscow's fifth column. The report stated: "When dealing with communism, we must recognize that this is a world revolution movement commanded by a foreign government." The evidence cited includes documents published by the Communist Party and former Communist Party members, as well as Stalin's remarks. Among them, the instruction issued by the Communist International to the American Communist Party in 1927 stated that the party should urgently engage in the greatest struggle against the American imperialists' intervention and counter-revolutionary war in China and Nicaragua. The report of the House Un-American Activities Committee directly pointed out that the American Communist Party is a spy for a foreign government commanding the world revolution, and the British Communist Party Congress held in London in February of this year was actually a meeting of the Communist International. The report also stated: Fifteen to twenty years ago, the Communist Party relied only on the weak Soviet government for support, and its activities did not need to be taken seriously, and it could be naturally eliminated by democratic methods. By 1947, this totalitarian bridgehead had penetrated deeply into the labor movement, government, political parties, newspapers, radio stations, movies, schools, churches, and various social organizations. Because Communist Party members are strictly disciplined, they hold important positions in popular organizations, and rely on the Soviet government, the world's major power. Therefore, the power of the Communist Party has exceeded the proportion of its numbers. The American communist movement is based on the discipline required by the Soviet Communist Party, and its goal is to abolish the current economic democratic government of the United States and establish a Soviet dictatorship. If the strength of the American Communist Party is fully mobilized and given significant assistance by a powerful foreign country, it will be able to seriously disrupt the economic and social life of the United States, and even damage the effectiveness of the American military. The American Communist Party has always been an integral part of the Moscow-controlled worldwide communist organization, unconditionally obeying Moscow's orders, and using its manpower and resources for the disposal of the Soviet government or the Communist International, and obeying orders to operate in any part of the world. The report also stated: The Soviet "New Times" magazine, published in five languages, has been recognized as the successor of the Communist International, and its editorials are regarded as maxims by communist parties around the world.

### Requesting Congressional Appropriation for Investigating Communist Party Funds

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th, United Press] President Truman will soon request Congressional appropriation for the funds needed to implement his policy of eliminating communists and fellow travelers from government positions. The cost of the federal government's loyalty investigation of civil servants is estimated to be approximately $25 million.

### Anti-Communist Sentiment in America Intensifies Daily

[United Press, Washington, 30th] It is learned that preparations for resisting communism in the United States have been increasingly strengthened in the past few days. According to unofficial opinions, it is believed that the US government has actually announced that, in addition to Greece and Turkey, Germany and Korea are also the main lines for resisting communism. Acting Secretary of State Acheson once declared: Assuming that the Soviet Union has no intention of cooperating with the United States on the unification of Korea, the only way for the United States is to make South Korea increasingly prosperous and make the Soviet occupation zone pale in comparison. Assistant Secretary of the Army Hiltring, who is responsible for occupation affairs, told the Appropriations Committee yesterday that the United States must continue to engage in economic warfare with the Soviet Union in Germany for at least three years. American public opinion is now firmly supporting the opinions of the State Department and Congress. The government's method of resisting communism is to prove with facts how much better the people in the occupation zone live under a democratic system. All indications now show that Republican members, who once aimed to reduce taxes, will also support President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey at any cost. Most of the controversy against Truman's plan is only a formality.

### Republican Senator Monnet Suggests a Meeting Between the Two Giants, Truman and Stalin; Truman Says He Has No Such Intention at Present

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Republican Senator Monnet urged President Truman today at the House Foreign Affairs Committee to personally meet with Soviet Marshal Stalin in order to eliminate the differences between communist Soviet Union and democratic countries. However, President Truman told reporters that he has no intention of participating in any great power conference recently, and that negotiations between leaders of various countries would be useless at present. Monnet said, "I feel that only through such talks can we obtain a clear outline of the scope of the agreement that should be established between major countries at this critical period in international relations." The US government's $400 million aid plan to Greece and Turkey is tantamount to an action facing the edge of an international march toward communism. Similar situations, such as Iran, Korea, China, and other countries that will be in similar situations, such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Italy, Lebanon, Egypt, etc., should also be considered. Monnet continued, "The appropriate place to contain the aggressive forces of communism should be in Moscow, and an understanding should be reached on the following matters: (1) Effective international guarantees prohibiting the production and use of atomic bombs; (2) The United Nations mechanism guarantees the autonomous privileges of independent countries; (3) The boundaries and foreign policies prevailing in the post-war world."

### The Dodecanese Islands Will Be Returned to Greece Today

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 29th] The Dodecanese Islands will be returned to Greece on the 31st of this month. At that time, the Greek government and parliament will send representatives to participate in the ceremony. Greek gendarmes landed on the islands yesterday, and the islanders welcomed them warmly. Commercial airlines between mainland Greece and these islands will be opened in mid-April.

### The Aftermath of the Atomic Bomb Still Lingers

More than 500 People Still Under Treatment

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] It is reported that there are still 557 people in Hiroshima who were injured by the atomic bomb and are currently being treated in hospitals. It has been more than nineteen months since the bombing. A total of 52,000 people were originally injured, but most of the injured recovered after one month of treatment, while others received varying degrees of treatment for two, three, or six months. The injured were all within one or two kilometers of the center of the bomb's impact.

### US Fleet to Sail to Northern Europe, Participants are the Newest US Warships

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] The US Navy Department announced that it will send two new battleships and the most modernized aircraft carriers to the waters of Northern Europe in June for training cruises. Admiral Conolly, commander of the US Navy in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, said that the new battleships are the "New Jersey" and "Wisconsin", and the aircraft carriers are the "Randolph" and the "Essex" or "Kearsarge". The ports to be visited during this trip include Portsmouth, Weymouth, Plymouth, Greenwich, Woolwich, Rosyth, Oslo, Gothenburg, and Copenhagen. The "New Jersey" and "Wisconsin" each have a displacement of 45,000 tons, are equipped with nine 16-inch guns, twelve 5-inch guns, and a speed of 35 knots. Each of the two mother ships has a displacement of 27,000 tons and can carry 100 aircraft.

### US Opinion Poll Shows Support for Aid to Greece and Turkey

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th] The results of a recent US opinion poll show that the public largely supports President Truman's plan to aid Greece, but regrets that the Greek issue was not first submitted to the United Nations for review. The survey results showed that 60% of people support financial aid to Greece, but do not support sending a military advisory group to train the troops in the two countries, and hope that the use of American loans will be supervised by American experts on the spot.

### Wallace to Visit Europe

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 29th] Former US Secretary of Commerce Wallace formally announced today: I will be traveling to Britain and France in April. I hope to arrive in Paris on April 16th and will visit French President Auriol, Prime Minister Ramadier, and other French political figures. In addition, I will also travel to the capitals of Sweden and Denmark.

### Navy Secretary Forrestal Declares: US Navy is Fearless, Europe, Asia, and Africa Cannot Be Dominated by Totalitarian Countries

[United Press, St. Louis, 30th] According to Navy Secretary Forrestal's announcement today: "The United States should provide political, economic, and, if necessary, military assistance to countries that want to maintain a free system." Forrestal referred to President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey, saying: "If the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa are dominated by a totalitarian country, then the 'Western Hemisphere' will also be in a difficult position to resist these countries." He also said: "But when the oceans remain open, it will be difficult for these countries to gain control of Europe, Asia, and Africa." The Secretary of the Navy also said: "The United States currently has one aircraft carrier mobile unit in the Pacific and another in the Atlantic, ready to be dispatched at any time."

### Britain to Ask Lie to Convene a UN General Assembly to Discuss the Palestine Issue

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] Official sources confirmed today that Britain will soon ask UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie to convene a special session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the Palestine issue. It is said that Britain has now abandoned the concept of appointing a special investigator to the Palestine issue. The meeting may be held in May. Britain will not submit any plans to the UN organization, and the UN General Assembly will draft specific recommendations for the future political status of Palestine.

### Secretariat Consults China, France, and the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 30th] It is reported that the United Nations Secretariat, at the request of the British delegation, has informally contacted China, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the possibility of convening a United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Palestine issue. As of now, no response has been received from any of the three delegations.

### Flying Over the Gates of Hell to See the Lair of the Fire Spirit Mother: Airlines Do Speculative Business

[Agence France-Presse, Reykjavik, Iceland, 29th] The Vantsman volcano island in southern Iceland erupted greatly today, with thick smoke rising thousands of feet, and molten rock also very high. The entire volcano was surrounded by clouds and the sun was not visible. There are no residents on the island, so there are no reports of casualties. Icelandic airlines are taking advantage of this volcanic eruption, which has not been seen in a century, to launch volcano tours, with advertisements saying: "Fly over the Gates of Hell and see the Lair of the Fire Spirit Mother." The curious flocked to it in droves.

After reading the newspaper, Thiamire was furious. Yesterday, in the lounge of the National Assembly, he met the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, who is also a Radical Socialist MP, Bastie. He immediately stepped forward to question him, and an argument ensued. Thiamire slapped Bastie in the face and proposed a duel, which was held this afternoon. The two men stood twenty-five paces apart, both wearing coats and hats. They fired twice, but neither hit the other. After the duel, the two still refused to shake hands and make peace.

The budget must be balanced, but it cannot be taken from export trade. The British government has tried its best to negotiate a trade agreement with the Soviet Union.

### Severe Famine in the Soviet Union, Many Farmers Starve to Death

[United Press, Paris, 29th] French officials familiar with the Soviet Union said today that in recent weeks, thousands of farmers have died of starvation in four regions of the Soviet Union: Ukraine, Lower Volga, Upper Volga, and Western Siberia. The famine was caused by severe droughts in the grain-producing areas of the European part of the Soviet Union last year, and most of the wheat harvest in Siberia was destroyed by torrential rains. Earlier, a telegram from Moscow quoted an official statement saying that there was a nationwide drought, resulting in an extremely serious food situation. The situation deteriorated during Christmas last year, and the Soviet government began slaughtering a large number of household animals on an unprecedented scale. There are two reasons: one is that livestock lacked forage and were dying, and the second is that animal meat could be used for human consumption. As a result, although meat consumption in Soviet cities was higher than in previous years, the number of livestock after the war was far below normal, and the reduction was huge. It is estimated that one-third of the total number of Soviet livestock were slaughtered in the winter. People also feel a shortage of food, but they cannot tell the outside world, which makes the situation worse. Soviet leaders believe that at a time of international tension, revealing domestic weaknesses will undermine the plan. Therefore, the Soviet Union cannot even ask for help.

### World Trade War

â€” Special Translation by Our Newspaper's Editorial Department

The United States is currently engaged in a war of great magnitude, the outcome of which will have an impact on our lives no less significant than the war triggered by the Pearl Harbor incident. The weapons we use in this war are not battleships, airplanes, or atomic bombs, but gleaming new car washes, refrigerators, machine tools, newsprint, and all kinds of manufactured goods.

In this commercial war, our enemies are the other victorious nations of World War II. The battlefield is Latin America, an area of eight million square miles, which has not suffered war damage, with an estimated seven billion dollars in cash, and rich in resources and commercial opportunities. In a world hindered by trade treaties, power politics, and spheres of influence, Latin America is the only free market where we can compete freely with our enemies.

During the War

During World War II, the British and Soviet governments agreed to cooperate in purchasing materials in Latin America. They jointly purchased tin from Bolivia, meat from Argentina, rubber from Brazil, copper from Chile, and other war materials. They at least kept prices under control, preventing them from skyrocketing. However, when the war ended, the cooperative purchasing agreement also ended, and each country was only concerned with its own interests.

Immediately, Bolivia demanded higher tin prices from the United States, and then Argentina notified Bolivia that it must sell tin and rubber to Argentina, otherwise food supplies would be cut off.

International trade is not just about finding out who has goods and trying to buy them; similarly, selling goods in the world market is not as simple as supplying goods to the market. Now it is governments that are engaged in buying and selling; transactions are no longer a question of what to sell or at what price, but what kind of political relationship exists. Fair competition has been eliminated by countries that loudly proclaim "free trade."

In 1945, the United States, at the Mexico City Conference, allowed assistance to Latin American countries in implementing industrialization, in exchange for free trade among the countries of the Americas. The United States provided them with loans and industrial equipment and helped them establish factories, hoping that the governments of Latin American countries would allow merchants to trade freely under fair competition. However, European countries ignored these merchants and conducted transactions with their governments.

Current Situation in South America

Therefore, when American merchants try to buy raw materials from Latin America, they find that the government has already signed trade contracts with European countries, leaving no room for private manufacturers to intervene, leaving American merchants at a loss. Because private enterprises, no matter how large, cannot compete with foreign governments or another private enterprise supported by a foreign government. In this commercial war, European merchants and their governments fight shoulder to shoulder, making full use of political pressure, military espionage, and the sacred diplomatic bag of tricks.

The United States must not only compete with the governments of Latin American countries individually, but also faces collective competitors in Argentina. To fix prices, Britain, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands are planning to agree to jointly purchase fats and oils from Argentina to counter PerÃ³n's policy of choosing customers and selling at the best price.

British and Soviet Strategies

No Allied nation suffered greater commercial sacrifices during the war than Britain. In 1943, Britain's exports were only a quarter of what they were in 1938. Britain's major industries had been bombed, overseas investments had been sold or mortgaged to buy war materials, and most of its merchant ships had sunk to the bottom of the sea. Britain needed to import almost all of its raw materials from abroad. Under these circumstances, it is probably impossible for Britain to compete with American industrial nations on fair terms.

The Soviet Union, of course, concentrated its trade activities on the Western Hemisphere buying agencies of the government, creating the Soviet economic sphere of influence, which is reflected in the growing power of the Communist Party in Latin American groups.

Control Policy

During the war, the United States' neighbors could not obtain the necessary manufactured goods, so they began to manufacture them themselves. The governments, seeing that their products could not compete with American goods, erected tariff barriers and adopted other protectionist policies. Mexico announced tax-free exports of new industrial products and has already exported textiles to other countries in the Americas to compete with the United States. Brazil learned to manufacture destroyers, tanks, and freight cars from the United States, and is now able to manufacture its own cars, airplanes, and other industrial products, and no longer purchases them from the United States. Argentina adopted an import license system, issuing import permits when important American goods are needed, but the Argentine government can refuse to issue these permits at any time and issue them to other countries that President PerÃ³n considers politically favorable. Peru also adopted an import license system, and Colombia banned the use of US dollars for luxury goods. Governments throughout Latin America in the Western Hemisphere are gradually adopting strict control over the national economy, as if the United States is the only country in the world that advocates free trade.

Despite the guarantees made by representatives of various countries at the Mexico City Conference to implement an "international program to eliminate trade barriers," the above-mentioned situations actually occurred. When the United States transformed its wartime industries into peacetime industries, it was merely a technical change, but other countries not only changed their factories, but also changed their entire political and diplomatic structures.

Britain has also launched a fierce economic war. Reuters, a British news agency subsidized by the British government, provides news to Latin American newspapers and radio stations at a much lower price than American news agencies. Reuters uses its readers and listeners not only to advertise British goods, but also to skillfully spread disguised anti-American propaganda, causing the United States to lose many friends.

American Attitude

The attitude of the International Trade Policy Division of the United States Department of State is: the scope of international trade should be expanded and operated by private enterprises, and all countries should be treated equally without discrimination. As far as the United States itself is concerned, this is a very good attitude, but I am afraid that other countries may not agree.

They said: "We need to export a lot because our production is too large. To keep our people from becoming unemployed, we have to sell our goods abroad. We can also produce and sell goods cheaper than other countries? In a free trade world, we will exclude others and monopolize the market. So they set up agreements on their own to shut us out, thinking of resisting. But we can decide for ourselves how to do business within the borders of the United States. If we don't approve of what other countries are doing, then there is nothing we can do, because we don't use our political power in Latin America to achieve economic goals."

They are right, America's attitude reflects America's lack of foreign policy. We hope to achieve the goal of exporting 20 million US dollars a year, so that 12 million Americans will not lose their jobs, the same number as the unemployed in 1932.

But if we expect the world to wait for us to solve the trade problem first, we are going to be disappointed. Americans who feel smug looking at new cars parked on the docks ready to be shipped abroad really don't know that we are only exporting one out of every nineteen new cars, while France, for example, is exporting two out of every three cars.

### Beijing and Shanghai Post Offices Actively Improve, Implementing Zonal Delivery System, Simplifying Procedures to Increase Postal Delivery Speed and Convenience for the Public, Director of the Post Office Hosted a Press Conference Yesterday to Report Details

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Postal Administration hosted a press conference yesterday to report on the recent construction and future improvement plans of the post office. According to Director Li Jinlu, who stated at the meeting: The post office has been in operation for more than 50 years. After years of gradual construction and improvement, it has reached its current scale. However, the post office is closely related to the public, so all facilities are based on the premise of the public. Even during the Anti-Japanese War, whether in the front or rear, or in occupied areas, the work of the post office was never interrupted. It has been more than a year since the victory, and the fluctuations in prices have affected the post office, making it difficult to reach the ideal stage, that is, not being utilized by every citizen. Therefore, in the future, we hope that the national public and the postal authorities will cooperate closely and exert even greater efforts. According to Wang Yuguang, assistant to the director of the bureau, there are seven major goals for operating the post office: (1) speed, (2) accuracy, (3) safety, (4) universality, (5) thoughtfulness, (6) convenience, and (7) inexpensiveness. The Post Office Standing Committee is currently striving to improve based on this principle. At the same time, it announced that in order to simplify the work of sorting postal items and to increase delivery speed, a zonal delivery system will be implemented in Beijing and Shanghai starting today. The entire city of Shanghai will be divided into 18 delivery zones, each represented by a number, and each zone will have a designated post office to handle the delivery affairs of that zone. This system is widely used in major cities in Europe and the United States, and it can not only increase delivery speed but also reduce mis-sorting incidents. It is hoped that all sectors of Shanghai will indicate the delivery zone number on the envelope in parentheses when sending mail in the future, and also notify the sender to add the same notation on the return mail. For example, "Shanghai (11) No. 100 Guizhou Road, sent or received by so-and-so." The post office has printed a directory of Shanghai delivery zones and street names for public request, or you can inquire at the nearest post office.

Delivery Zone Â· Number and Name of Post Office

Regarding the delivery zone number and the name of the designated delivery post office for one of these plans, the following is listed: (0) Administration Bureau, (1) Huaihai Road Branch, (4) Dongchang Road Branch, (5) Wusong Road Branch, (9) Zhongzheng North Second Road Branch, (10) (1) Fujian Middle Road Branch, (12) Jinling Middle Road Branch, (13) Jinling East Road Branch, (16) Xujiahui Branch, (17) North Railway Station Post Office, (10) (8) Sinan Road Branch, (19) Tilanqiao Branch, (20) Xujiahui Branch, (21) South Railway Station Road Branch, (23) Jing'an Temple Branch, (25) Jianguo East Road Branch, (27) Changning Road Branch, (30) Wusong Road Branch.

Mobile Post Office

Since the post office resumed operations, according to Wang, there are a total of 28 new facilities that have been completed and are under planning for the improvement of business operations. The main ones are: (1) simplifying the procedures for registered and express mail, requiring only a date stamp on the receipt when receiving mail. (2) Commonly establishing urban agency offices and postage stamp sales offices. Currently, 22 agency offices and 277 postage stamp sales offices have been added in Shanghai's urban area. Post office branches are also being planned to be added. One branch has been opened at the South Railway Station Branch, and another branch will be added to the telecommunications bureau at the corner of Fuzhou Road on Sichuan Middle Road soon. (3) Adding postal kiosks. First, to facilitate passengers traveling between Beijing and Shanghai, a postal kiosk has been set up in the North Railway Station Hall, and agreement has been reached with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to add a postal kiosk at the Jinliyuan Wharf. (4) Adding mobile post office vehicles. Due to the vast area of the city, in order to facilitate the delivery of mail by various communities and residents far from the city center, a mobile post office vehicle will be launched in the near future. It will travel on a fixed route every day, stopping at each station to sell stamps and receive all kinds of mail, issue small money orders, etc. In addition, ordinary mailboxes and special mailboxes will be added to facilitate rapid delivery.

In terms of postal transportation, in addition to setting up a mobile post office on the Beijing-Shanghai train, it is also hoped that the public can make more use of unified airmail to send mail to distant places.

Selling Small Mailboxes

In addition, due to the dense population of Shanghai, the post office believes that mail carriers waste a lot of time asking for information and waiting for households to deliver letters. In order to improve delivery and save manpower, the post office has specially made a small mailbox for public use. In addition, it is promoting the "holding mail at the post office" method. Anyone who has just arrived in Shanghai and has no fixed address can notify the sender to send the mail to the Shanghai â—‹â—‹ Post Office for "holding mail at the post office," and they can pick it up at the post office when the time comes.

Philatelic Services

New businesses include insured registered mail, express parcels, and check savings. At the same time, it has also resumed the businesses of value-declared mail, collecting payment for mail, subscribing to publications, and overseas remittances. In addition, it also handles the collection of taxes, plans to purchase stamps and seals by telephone, and establishes a philatelic group to serve philatelic enthusiasts.

### Letter to the Editor

The news you published on the 29th of this month regarding the seizure of a secret radio station is completely inconsistent with the facts. Our radio station is in contact with various ships to maintain navigation safety and facilitate business communication, and it has long been reported to the Ministry of Communications. Many shipping companies with more ships have permanent stations, which are similar to our situation. The Ministry of Communications has approved No. 6976 of the Special Radio Station between our office and Sanbei Transportation Company and Minsheng Industrial Company. All procedures are being handled. Since several radio stations have neither received commercial calls nor charged a single penny, the sections mentioned in your newspaper are obviously rumors and untrue. This is to inform you accordingly, and please correct it. Sincerely, the Joint Office of Dada Shipping Company and Datong Shipping Company. March 29, 36th year.

### Reader Consultation

Legal Questions

(1) Withdrawal of Deposits

Huang Shiqi asks: Before the Anti-Japanese War, I deposited funds in banks and post offices. The bank was a fixed deposit with regular installments, and the post office was a current deposit. Later, due to the war, the deposits were stopped. Now, ten years later, I plan to withdraw these deposits, but the value of the currency today is very different from the past. I don't know which ratio to use for withdrawal. Please advise.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] There are no special laws to rely on regarding your questions. You can refer to the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Affairs after Rehabilitation, and let the court decide.

(2) Successive Leases

Wang Yun asks: In the 26th year of the Republic, I leased a piece of land from someone named Jia for a term of ten years, which will expire at the end of October of this year. However, during the war, my father sublet the land to someone named Yi, mistakenly setting the lease term to the end of October of next year. Rent has already been collected in advance. Now Jia insists on taking back the land at the end of October of this year, while Yi insists that it must be returned by October of next year. May I ask: (1) Am I criminally liable for this incident? (2) How should I deal with it if Jia and Yi both demand huge compensation from me?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies] (1) It is a civil matter and not criminally liable. (2) The amount of compensation is based on actual damages suffered.

### Suzhou and Hangzhou Scenic Spots Spring Outing Group Travel Frequent; Travel Agencies and Groups Are Busy; Groups of Tourists Are Crowded

[Special Feature from Our Newspaper] The tail of winter was intercepted in the last anti-Siberian cyclone of the day before yesterday. The willows next door have innocently added tender buds, dancing in the wind, attracting people living in the city to go to open places, to contact a resolution of green and fresh nature, to stretch their curved backs, and to breathe the breath that exists in the countryside.

The season of green and freshness has arrived. It is time for people to return to nature and relive a childhood dream.

In the past few days, the business of the two railway bureaus has begun to pick up again. Tourists visiting Suzhou and Hangzhou are swallowed up in the black carriages in groups, interspersed with people walking single-handedly. People waiting to buy tickets are as crowded as during the Lunar New Year. The business of photographic materials stores has suddenly become prosperous. The photography department of Watson's Pharmacy on Welcome Nanjing Road was also visited by thieves in one resolution, and nineteen cameras worth ten million yuan were found stolen overnight.

The previous weekend, the two railway bureaus invited reporters from various newspapers to visit Hangzhou, which was the first sound of this year's group "spring outing." Several famous travel agencies and tour groups in Shanghai are also busy serving tourists and their members. The China Travel Service has a wide range of businesses and has a special tour group that specializes in group travel. The company's travel magazine is the only Chinese travel publication sold worldwide. It collects and details all the famous scenic spots and historical sites in the country and even around the world. The second is an amateur-oriented Yousheng Travel Group, which has a history of thirty years and now has more than 13,000 members. Before the war, it also published the "Yousheng Monthly" and various special publications. There are also two travel agencies, Pacific and Economic, and two tour groups, Pingzong and Amateur. In addition to traveling, they all have auxiliary achievements in promoting social education.

The difference between a travel "agency" and a travel "group" lies in the fact that the latter has fixed members, does not accept commissions from non-members, and specializes in handling travel business for members. To clarify the travel situation of each family for readers, the reporter made a general visit to them. They almost all have a certain tour schedule every week. This weekend is all inconsistent with going to Suzhou and Hangzhou. Each resolution has a limit on the number of people, and if the limit is exceeded, another organization can be formed. The cost depends on the distance of the tour and the local living expenses. For example, going to Hangzhou for three days, the most expensive is the Pingzong Travel Group, which requires 280,000 yuan, and the Yousheng Travel Group only needs 150,000 yuan. The China Travel Service is 270,000 yuan, the Economic Travel Agency is 250,000 yuan, the Pacific Travel Agency is 245,000 yuan, and the Amateur Travel Group is 175,000 yuan, all of which provide round-trip fixed train preparations. Depending on the difference in cost, it is possible that the enjoyment aspects are also graded, such as cruise ships, cars, early lunch and dinner, hotel tea, etc. According to the person in charge of Yousheng Travel Agency, it is often a loss to serve the members.

In addition, the Hangzhou travel organized by the Youth Center will depart on the 4th of next month. The stipulated quota of 100 people has long been fully registered. Participants only pay 65,000 yuan, including all round-trip expenses. If the result of the trial run can break even, the museum will continue to hold it for the next few weekends until people are bored.

The Writers' Hangzhou Sightseeing Group will also depart at the beginning of next month. April 1 and 2 are the spring holidays for various schools, and there are countless private and group travel organizations. It's just that due to the limitations of vehicles, the two railway bureaus cannot supply as much as before the war. It is now extremely difficult to be able to supply travel agencies with a special train, and discounts are out of the question!

### Dedication to This Year's Normal Education Movement Week The Basic Cultivation of the Education Career

--- Yang Tongfang

One-One Inspiring Teachers' Love

The education career is the most noble spiritual career. Those engaged in the education career must have a pure and profound love in order to enlighten the wisdom of children or youth and mold the personality of children or youth. A teacher who can truly influence the hearts of students and make education have a positive effect must use the most ardent love to nourish the souls of students.

Our ancient sages once said, "It is easy to find a teacher of scriptures, but difficult to find a teacher of people." Indeed, if we want to find a teacher who specializes in imparting knowledge and skills, it is relatively easy, but it is very difficult to ask for a teacher who can truly give students personality training and emotional guidance. Because the former is mostly external and passive; while the latter is internalized and spontaneous. The former can at most enable students to increase their knowledge and skills; while the latter can enable students to have emotional exchanges with teachers through internal insights, thus changing their entire behavior.

According to the advanced educational principles, the biggest purpose of education is to seek changes in the behavior of the educated. The so-called behavior should include all the thoughts, habits, emotions, attitudes, etc. of students. Traditional education has been deeply influenced by intellectualism, thinking that education only needs to read and listen to lectures, but in fact it has discarded the main purpose of education. The erroneous concepts of "literacy is education" and "reading is education" dominate the minds of ordinary people, causing most people in society to misunderstand education. In fact, the value of education must be demonstrated through the hearts of the educated to achieve the practical application of behavior. Therefore, knowledge, emotion, and will become the three elements in the education process, and emotion is especially indispensable for acquiring knowledge and exercising will. Modern educators believe that all learning should first stimulate motivation and interest. But to stimulate motivation and interest, we must create a strong emotional effect on the learners' hearts toward the learning objects---teachers, teaching materials, and all teaching situations, so that they are willing to accept them. From this situation, we can see how great the impact of the teacher's attitude on students' learning is.

However, most teachers ignore this point, which has led to the tendency of education to become "commercialized." Schools have become places to sell knowledge, and teachers' teaching seems to be selling knowledge to students. Students enter schools as if they are buying knowledge from teachers. There is no emotion between teachers and students, and teachers don't even need to ask about changes in students' behavior. Of course, this situation cannot be generalized. We can sometimes see enlightened teachers who use passionate love to warm the hearts of children or youth, and achieve the practical effect of personality influence. However, there don't seem to be many who can do this, otherwise wouldn't the effect of education be greatly enhanced?

The old academy system in our country is very admirable in some situations. Because it can pay attention to the emotional connection between teachers and students, it emphasizes character-building. Looking at the private schools of the past, from the point of view that teachers and students have more opportunities for contact, they are not without merit. The teacher's stern face sometimes makes students fearful, but the relationship between the teacher and the student, and the teacher and the student's parents, is almost impossible to regain in today's schools. The different educational organizations of today and the past are a major reason for this, and the teacher's failure to exert the emotional power of military education is another major reason.

I remember Kexinsterler once said: "The essence of the teacher's spirit is pure love for children. Those who cannot love children cannot be educators at all." This can also be applied to educating young people. Young people and toddlers are endowed with innate intimacy, and their frank and innocent nature surpasses that of middle-aged and elderly people. Rather than teaching him with strict authority, it is better to move him with sincerity. Education is not coercion, but guidance; it is not injection, but enlightenment. If teachers can use more encouragement and encouragement to guide students in all learning, the effect will be very great. When teachers gain the trust of students, they don't have to worry about them not accepting the teacher's guidance. When they accept the teacher's guidance, they don't have to worry about him not being inspired by the teacher in terms of thoughts, habits, emotions, and attitudes, and affecting the development of his entire personality.

In recent years, the education authorities in our country have paid great attention to improving the guidance methods of schools at all levels, such as implementing the "counselor system" and advocating the common life of teachers and students, which are all important plans. We hope that teachers can show ardent love, not advocating that education should be completely free and laissez-faire, and not emphasizing discipline. On the contrary, we very much hope that those engaged in the education career can work hard for education with a serious attitude, but the love we require is definitely not doting, but pure love, compassion, and love accompanied by reason. Confucius' educational spirit of being strict in appearance but gentle in approach should still be emulated by today's teachers.

### Qingbai Wins Final Spot in the Mayor's Cup Soccer Tournament; Barely Defeats Soviet Team 2-1 in Semi-Final

In the Mayor's Cup soccer semi-final, Qingbai and the Soviet team met at the Yuanyuan Stadium at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Cao Qiuting and Wu Qixiang of Qingbai both played. Fans flocked to the stadium, and the Yuanyuan Stadium was crowded with about 14,000 people, creating a lively atmosphere. As a result of the competition, Cao Qiuting scored a goal in the first half to take the lead. In the second half, the Soviet team counterattacked and equalized. Qingbai's defense faced frequent danger, but thanks to efforts in the last three minutes, Hui Qiuting kicked a free kick and Luo Shoufu scored, narrowly defeating the Soviet team 2-1 and winning the final spot. They will face Donghua for the Mayor's Cup championship. The lineups of both sides yesterday are recorded below:

Qingbai

Qin Bigao

Yan Shixin Wu Qixiang (on) Xue Peiran (off)

Qu Yongfu Meng Yiliang Gao Baozheng (off) Xue Peiran (on)

Cao Qiuting Luo Shoufu Li Yichen Gao Baozheng (on) Gu Yisa Li Songjun (off) Fei Chunhua (off)

Soviet

Chai Halov

Xue Sigu (off) Kaluolielu (on) Gutov

Sha Luoning Tiefunini Bolang (off) Jielingguv

Kaluolielu (off) Nuogaoluofu (on) E Gelinas S Laobvsitv Abiguf Kapvsiting

Qiu Ting Opens the Scoring Within Eight Minutes

At exactly 3:00 PM, referee Huang Renyi and linesmen Chen Jixiang and He Chunhui took to the field to officiate. The two sides lined up, and after the Soviet team presented flowers, they immediately attacked. Laobvsitv and Abiguf advanced together, but were blocked by Yiliang. Qingbai counterattacked, and Luo Shoufu and Li Sikui repeatedly had shooting opportunities, but none were successful. At eight minutes, Gu Yisa hooked the ball from the baseline, Cao Qiuting rushed up and added a kick, and the ball went into the net. Qingbai opened the scoring 1-0.

End of First Half

Qingbai Leads by One Goal

The Soviet team, having lost the first goal, launched a large-scale attack. Nuogaoluofu crossed from the left corner, but Little Huang Mao was offside first. In the melee at 24 minutes, Wu Qixiang left the field due to a foot injury, Gao Baozheng retreated to defend the right forward, Little Gu moved inside, and Li Songjun took over the right wing. The Soviet team took advantage of the Qingbai's empty defense and launched a fierce attack. Fortunately, Yan Shixin and Meng Yiliang responded properly and defended the position, and soon the first half ended. Qingbai then led by 1-0.

A Cold Arrow Hitting the Mark

The Soviet Team Equaled the Score

After the break, the two armies fought again. Qingbai's five forwards advanced, but Qiuting lost contact and had no place to use his strength. Yichen's laziness was aroused, and Songyi was slow to move. The center-back line assisted the defense, but the front line was out of reach. The entire team was divided into two parts. The Soviet team was determined to take revenge and had a strong attack. Kaji Siding, single-handedly explored the camp, but fortunately Bigao was alert and was not taken advantage of. Not long after, Little Huang Mao tried again outside the boat code, and the ball was urgent and turned into a corner kick. Nuogaoluofu opened it, just right, and Sha Luoning fired a cold arrow from the crowd and hit the mark, 1-1 The Soviet team leveled the score.

Free Kick

Little Luo Laid the Foundation for Victory

The foreign army succeeded and became even more rampant. In front of Qingbai's goal, enemy cavalry was rampant. At 34 minutes, the lazy cow's nature broke out and injured Tingling Guf, and Bolang entered to replace him. Qingbai changed generals, replacing Li Songjun with Fei Chunhua, and then got a turning point. Qiuting was active, and the Soviet team was in a hurry. At 42 minutes, Sha Luoning committed a handball foul by mistake, and Little Sanzi took the penalty outside the 18-yard line.

### Draft Rules for Soliciting and Selling US Dollar Bonds Approved by Finance Minister Yu Yesterday Morning; National Bank Orders the Establishment of Solicitation and Sales Committees in Various Regions After Reporting to the Ministry of Finance for Record and Distributing Instructions for Implementation

[Report from our newspaper] The draft rules for the solicitation, sale, collection, and invoicing of the 36th Year US Dollar Treasury Bonds and the organizational regulations of the Fund Supervisory Committee have been submitted to Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance for approval yesterday morning and will be promulgated and implemented immediately. To this end, our reporter visited Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, to inquire about the details. Mr. Chen said that the various draft rules for the Treasury Bonds were submitted to Yu by Assistant Cabinet Member Gai Bomeng yesterday morning.

approved. The organizational rules of the Solicitation and Sales Committees in various regions were formulated by the Central Bank yesterday (29th), reported to the Ministry of Finance for record

and distributed for implementation. These rules have been approved by the Ministry of Finance. The order of the Ministry regarding the conversion of the US dollar bonds purchased and paid will be published simultaneously today (30th).

Consolidating Creditworthiness and Sound Organization

Chen also summarized the main points of the organizational regulations of the Fund Supervisory Committee as follows: He said that in order to consolidate creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has strived to make the organization of the committee sound. For example, the regulations clearly stipulate that the committee "shall independently exercise its powers within the scope of supervision. Before the principal and interest of the treasury bonds are fully paid off, its supervisory authority shall not be changed." "It may make suggestions to the Ministry of Finance at any time regarding matters related to consolidating government creditworthiness and safeguarding the rights and interests of bondholders." Furthermore, regarding state-owned enterprises and enemy/puppet properties guaranteed by the Treasury Bond Fund, it "may hire experts to conduct independent investigations and may supervise the sale of these enterprises and properties, as well as their operation before the sale." Also, "the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and other relevant competent authorities shall, in accordance with the regulations, allocate the funds of the Treasury Bonds to the Fund Supervisory Committee for safekeeping and supervision on time in advance." Before each redemption of principal and interest expires, the committee should "allocate the amount payable from the fund to the managing bank for payment and announce it in the newspaper." In addition, the committee is jointly organized by representatives of relevant agencies and leaders of financial, industrial, and commercial communities. The purpose of each provision is to strengthen the organization and authority of the committee and to seek openness in its operations, which is sufficient to demonstrate the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness.

Simplified Procedures and No Fees

Regarding whether the collection of funds for solicitation and sales in various regions will be handled exclusively by the National Bank, Chen said that the National Bank, entrusted with handling the solicitation and sales, may hire local people in various regions at home and abroad to organize solicitation and sales committees, and may designate several local banks and money shops to collect bond payments. The procedures for solicitation, sales, collection, and invoicing will be simplified as much as possible. Purchasers will not be charged any handling fees for paying the purchase price. The banks and money shops that collect bond payments should store the collected funds in a special account without interest. In addition to reporting the amount of revenue on the same day every day, they should settle accounts every ten days and remit them to the local National Bank, which will immediately transfer them to the head office for inclusion in the treasury account, and then the head office will report to the Ministry of Finance for record.

Matters Handled by the Solicitation and Sales Committee

The Solicitation and Sales Committees in various regions will handle the following matters: (1) Promotion and publicity of solicitation and sales. (2) Agreement of solicitation and sales groups and banks. (3) Simplification of solicitation and sales procedures and prevention of malpractices. (4) Allocation of solicitation and sales amounts and oversubscriptions. (5) Suggestions regarding the consolidation of the creditworthiness of these treasury bonds. The committee will have eleven to seventeen members. In addition to the local National Bank representative as an ex officio member, the remaining members will be appointed from representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, the Money Industry Association, and other leaders from all walks of life.

Finally, the reporter asked Mr. Chen that the government's efforts to seek national creditworthiness were welcomed by the people, but whether preparations were being made to reorganize pre-war public debts. He replied: This question is not the task of my trip to Shanghai, so I will not say much. In short, the various measures taken by the government to issue treasury bonds are sufficient to prove that the authorities have made up their minds to start anew with the people and make the greatest efforts to design and restore creditworthiness as much as possible.

[Another report] Chen Bingzhang, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance, returned to Nanjing by evening train last night.

Financial Leaders Express Opinions

Opinions on the government's issuance of bonds: (1) Qin Runqing, a veteran of the money industry, said briefly: The government's resolute issuance of US dollar bonds to maintain the value of the currency and guide floating capital in the market is in line with the people's psychology and can be called a wise move. What I hope from the government is that this income should be used to stabilize finance and alleviate the people's difficulties. Also, the custody of the fund should be extended to public groups to strengthen public confidence. (2) Luo Jihua, Executive Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said that the government's first announcement of the regulations for the issuance of US dollar bonds at the beginning of the implementation of the economic reform plan can be said to meet the needs of the times. The bonds are all denominated in US dollars, and there is no fear of currency devaluation. Prices and finance will be more stable, and the economic trend will gradually turn optimistic from this turning point.

### Silver Shops in the City to Resume Business Tomorrow

### Domestic Cigarettes Improve Quality; Sales of American Cigarettes Greatly Decrease; Most Imported Foreign Cigarettes are Smuggled Goods

According to people in the cigarette industry: Since the victory, foreign cigarettes were first imported with the US and British armies stationed in China and distributed to various cigarette stalls on the streets. Under the principle of affordable prices and good quality, smokers all bought and smoked them, and they became popular, causing the glory of domestic cigarettes to be suppressed, and sales suffered as a result. At that time, the most popular foreign cigarettes on the market were the American-made "Camel, Chesterfield, Marlboro, and Lucky Strike" and other brands. British cigarettes were second because of their high price. Later, due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, the prices of imported cigarettes rose significantly. In addition, the "Three Cannon Towers, Qianmen, and Dananwei" cigarettes produced by Yizhong Tobacco Company and the improvement of the quality of domestic cigarettes competed with them, and the sales of foreign cigarettes finally declined. Since the government implemented import controls this year, the import of cigarettes has been strictly restricted. Currently, most of the packaged and canned foreign cigarettes sold on the market are smuggled from Hong Kong and transported to Shanghai from South China. However, the sales of American cigarettes are not as prosperous as in the past.

### Gold Purchased by the National Bank to be Temporarily Stored in the National Treasury

The Central Bank, after adopting the policy of selling gold, purchased a large amount of gold from the United States to meet market needs. A ship from the United States arrived in Shanghai earlier this month from San Francisco, carrying a large amount of 26,000 catties (13 tons) of gold, which was recorded in this newspaper yesterday. It is rumored that this large amount of gold was ordered from the United States by former Prime Minister Song Ziwen for the Central Bank to use for sales, but it has only arrived in this port now, and the sales policy has been abolished. The shipping company is currently discussing delivery procedures with the Central Bank, but this batch of gold has lost the need for use, so it will be temporarily stored in the national treasury.

### Mayor Plans to Request Instructions from the Central Government to Reduce the Negotiated Price of Flour

[Report from our newspaper] It is learned that Mayor Wu believes that the current price of flour in the city seems to be too high. The ratio of flour price to rice price in the past averaged three and a half bags of flour to one dan of rice. However, according to the current prices of flour and rice, only two bags of flour are needed to equal one dan of rice. Therefore, he summoned the persons in charge of various flour mills to discuss ways to reduce the negotiated price. The manufacturers said that there are various difficulties in accumulating and that the supply of raw materials is not smooth, so please do not reduce the negotiated price for the time being. It is heard that Mayor Wu is planning to request instructions from the central government on the matter of reducing the negotiated price of flour in order to decide whether to reduce it or not.

[Another report] 10,000 tons of foreign wheat arrived here from the United States a week ago and have been unloaded by the Ministry of Food and will be allocated later.

### National Bank Discount and Loan Committee Officially Established Today

### Egg Exports to the UK to Resume Soon

[Special dispatch from the Central News Agency in Washington, D.C. on the 29th] According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, China is about to resume egg export trade. It is heard that according to the draft agreement, the Central Trust Bureau will financially assist the purchase, packaging, and refrigeration of eggs mainly exported to the UK. The USDA report also pointed out that the previous egg exports were valued at US$12 million annually, and said that the plan is subject to the approval of the Chinese government, as it involves foreign exchange rates and the profits and losses of the Central Trust Bureau. At the same time, it also needs to be discussed with the British Ministry of Food. The USDA report also said that under normal circumstances, most of the world's rapeseed production comes from China, and the export volume is extremely large. China's rapeseed production from 1946 to 1947 is estimated at about 4 million tons.

### Wool Textile Industry Requests Relaxation of Raw Material Quota; Chairman Cheng to Present to the Import Control Committee Today

[Report from our newspaper] The wool textile industry is facing a serious problem because the quota for wool raw materials is too small, and factories are successively stopping or reducing production. Yang Liren, Secretary of the association, has been rushing to produce more than a dozen types of statistical tables and will present them to Li, the Director of the Quota Allocation Department of the Import Control Committee, through Chairman Cheng, requesting a relaxation of the quota to avoid shutdowns. The national wool textile factory startup and employee statistics table is attached below:

### Private Factories Temporarily Suspend Oil Supply Due to Uncertainty of Raw Material Supply; There is Talk of Adjusting the Negotiated Price of Edible Oil Again

[Report from our newspaper] For the distribution of edible oil in the city, state-run oil factories continue to supply 700 dan per day through the China Vegetable Oil Factory without interruption. The distribution of 1,600 dan of edible oil from private oil factories contracted by the Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Distribution Office for the fourth cycle was completed on the 24th and has not been continued.

According to people in the industry, although private oil factories still have considerable reserves, they can only temporarily suspend oil supply due to the uncertainty of raw material supply. It is reported that the raw materials needed by state-run and private oil factories were once contacted with the Central Trust Bureau, and the bureau will first supply 4,000 tons of soybeans, distributing 3,000 tons to the China Vegetable Oil Factory and 1,000 tons to the private oil factories at a price of 60,000 yuan per dan. It is said that the plan has been approved by former Prime Minister Song Ziwen. It is currently heard that oil factories are sending representatives to discuss the matter with Mayor Wu, intending to request that the soybeans be quickly allocated to facilitate the continued extraction of oil to maintain people's food. It is also heard that the Edible Oil Price Review Committee will convene a meeting in the coming days, and the negotiated price of edible oil may be adjusted again.

Reasons for Rising Oil Prices

[Report from our newspaper] People in the oil industry analyze the reasons for the recent rise in oil prices, believing that: (1) land prices are expensive, and (2) large quantities of edible oil are exported from the city. It is said that a telegram came from Qingdao yesterday, stating that the price of raw oil in that area is 260,000 yuan per dan, and the transportation cost to Shanghai is 35,000 yuan per dan, so the net price per dan arriving in Shanghai has reached 295,000 yuan. If it is raw oil in a jeep barrel, then a barrel fee of 20,000 yuan per dan must be added. It was also found that 5,000 to 6,000 dan of raw oil were shipped from the city to Hong Kong in March to exchange for imported goods that could not be settled in foreign exchange. The government is paying close attention to this matter and is currently conducting a thorough investigation. In the past few days, foreign firms such as Baolong in the city have loaded and exported 1,000 tons of refined oil and peanut oil to foreign countries.

### The Taipei Incident: After the Storm, Ambitious Individuals Fish in Troubled Waters - A Complete Account

â€” Pai Ya

Since Taiwan's return to the motherland on October 25th of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], the initial period was focused on reception and organization. Governor Chen designated the 35th year [1946] as the year of reception. When Japan handed over Taiwan, all factories, mines, and production sectors were at a standstill. It was practically impossible to find a factory still emitting smoke. Therefore, although last year was called the year of reception, efforts were also made to restore the original work. Factories gradually began to emit smoke again, and production sites employed thousands upon thousands of workers. All sectors have made significant progress. Governor Chen, to stabilize Taiwan's finances and social order, and to prevent the island from being affected by domestic and international economic crises, requested that the central government allow Taiwan to continue using the Taiwan currency. He also implemented a monopoly policy to prevent foreign capital erosion and fluctuations in commodity prices. This was for the construction of Taiwan, the livelihood of the people, and to supplement the income of the provincial treasury.

Speaking of the monopoly policy, the main agency is the Monopoly Bureau. Its main monopoly goods are tobacco, alcohol, matches, camphor, etc. It remits 50% of its total monthly revenue to the treasury. To develop its business, the Monopoly Bureau naturally promotes the sale of its monopoly goods. Recently, it was discovered that foreign cigarettes were flooding the market, with small cigarette vendors filling the streets and alleys with smuggled cigarettes. Chinese people have always preferred foreign cigarettes, and Taiwan is no exception. As a result, the Monopoly Bureau's business has been severely affected. In late February, it was reported that a sailboat fully loaded with foreign cigarettes had landed at Tamsui, intending to infiltrate the city. Inspection officers were dispatched to investigate, and while the ship was found, the foreign cigarettes had already been unloaded. The officers then dispersed to investigate various illegal cigarette stalls, hoping to stop the practice.

The Beginning of the Trouble

On the evening of February 27th, at around 7 PM, inspection officers Sheng Tie-fu, Zhong Yan-zhou, Zhao Zi-jian, Liu Chao-qun, Chuan Xue-tong, and Ye De-gen, six in total, took a truck to the most bustling Yanping Road (formerly Taiping-cho) in Taipei City to conduct inspections. Quick-witted peddlers ran away to hide, but one female cigarette vendor, Lin Jiang-mai, was caught because she couldn't escape. The inspection officers, according to the law, naturally confiscated her goods. However, the female cigarette vendor resisted the confiscation, as it involved her entire capital. This led to a dispute between the two sides. A large crowd of people gathered to watch, and among them were some ruffians who were always looking for trouble. They seized the opportunity to join in the commotion and threw stones at the inspection officers. The sound of shouting was incessant, and punches and kicks were thrown in all directions. The few inspection officers were unable to resist and abandoned their vehicle, fleeing in different directions. However, the rioters did not let up and continued to chase after them as a group, determined to catch them. One inspection officer, cornered and desperate, fired a shot in self-defense, unintentionally hitting a person named Chen Wen-xi in the crowd. The bullet pierced his left chest, and he died on the spot. The female cigarette vendor Lin Jiang-mai was also injured. Thereupon, the rioters, together with a general public, went directly to the Military Police Headquarters and the Taipei City Police Department, demanding that the culprit be handed over for public execution to avenge the deceased. They beat gongs and shouted slogans to amplify their demands. Although the military police tried their best to explain, they could not ease the situation. The rioters also pushed the truck seized from the inspection officers to the Ximen Roundabout and set it on fire. This chaotic situation continued throughout the night.

The Onset of the Storm

By 9 AM the next day (the 28th), the crowd again marched through the streets, beating gongs and drums, forcibly ordering businesses to close. Shops throughout the city closed their doors one after another, and there was unrest everywhere, with the people in a state of panic. When a group of people beat gongs and drums to Taiping-cho, Police Chief Huang of a certain police station tried to stop them, but not only did it have no effect, but he was also surrounded and severely beaten. The police station was also destroyed by the rioters. This marked the beginning of the behavior of harming government personnel and destroying government agencies. Soon afterward, over ten thousand people besieged the Monopoly Bureau and the Taipei Branch. People from all directions rushed in like an avalanche, and anyone who was from mainland China was beaten. The matches, cigarettes, alcohol, cars, bicycles, and other public goods and property in the bureau were all carried out onto the road and burned. Even doors, windows and shutters were not spared, with nothing left intact. The flames soared into the sky, and on March 1st, the embers had not completely died out. There were still two or three thousand people watching. Although the military police arrived, they were unable to maintain order.

The Air is Filled with Wronged Souls

When the burning of the Monopoly Bureau began on the afternoon of the 28th, groups of rioters were everywhere in the streets and alleys of the city, searching for people from mainland China to beat, calling them "Ah Shan." Thus, if "Ah Shan" were spotted by them, they could not escape the disaster of being "beaten." Severe cases resulted in death, while minor cases resulted in disability. Even women, children, and pregnant women were not spared. According to what the reporter learned, a child of several years old was walking down the street with his mother when they encountered rioters. The rioters used a knife to cut the mother's mouth to the ear, stripped her clothes off, beat her severely until she was on the verge of death, and threw her into a ditch. The child was violently twisted around so that his face was backwards, and he immediately died. Another child was grabbed by his feet, inverted, and his head slammed into the ground until his head was broken and his brains were flowing. Another person slammed the heads of two children into each other until blood flowed from their brains, and this was treated as something to celebrate. A pregnant woman was stabbed in the abdomen with a Japanese samurai sword, and both lives were lost. Such venomous acts are too numerous to recount. It is shocking that such inhumane events would occur in Taiwan, which is said to have a higher level of culture than any other province in China. Those who heard about it were horrified, let alone those who witnessed it. At that time, all people from mainland China were in danger, fleeing or hiding. It was almost like "the wind howls, the crane cries, every plant and tree is a ruffian." The cries of "beat Ah Shan" echoed through the skies and did not stop. All government agencies closed their doors, and the staff all took flight as the best option. During this period, it can be said that it was a world of ruffians. At about 2 PM on the afternoon of the 28th, another group of one or two thousand people marched towards the Governor-General's Office, attempting to riot. They were stopped by the guards, who fired shots to disperse them. There were some casualties on both sides, but the rioters did not disperse and go home. Instead, the situation became even more complicated, and they went to the North Gate to besiege the Railway Police Department. Many officers of the department were severely beaten and had many rifles stolen. Fortunately, the military police arrived and were able to relieve the siege (because the military police were obeying Governor Chen's orders not to fire without authorization). Subsequently, students stopped attending classes, employees of various agencies and organizations went on strike, shops were closed, and people stayed at home with their doors shut. Everything fell into a state of extreme chaos. In total, the riots on this day spread throughout Taipei City. More than a dozen public and private cars and trucks were destroyed. A large number of people from mainland China and civil servants were beaten, injured, or killed. Tiger Balm Garden and Taipei's only large department store, Shin Tai Company, were both destroyed or looted. (According to preliminary investigations and statistics from the Department of Civil Affairs, in the Taipei area alone, more than 400 public and education personnel were killed or injured, and property losses amounted to 500 million Taiwan dollars, a staggering figure.) Other counties and cities have not yet been included. Most tragically, Zhu Wen-bo, the magistrate of Hsinchu County, was severely beaten by rioters in Taiping-cho while traveling to Taipei in his private car on official business. Fortunately, he escaped. At this time, passengers on trains from the south who were from mainland China were also beaten by ruffians lying in wait at the station when they got off the train. The number of deaths and injuries was also very high. In order to stabilize the order, the Governor-General's Office and the Garrison Command announced martial law in the evening. But at night, the ruffians still moved around in groups with guns and knives. Gunshots were heard frequently, making it impossible to sleep, as if one were on a battlefield.

Government's Response

This incident, which had been brewing since the evening of the 27th, not only did not subside by the evening of the 8th, but actually escalated. Therefore, the Governor-General's Office and the Garrison Headquarters, in addition to announcing martial law, also issued a statement on the handling of the incident. The main points are as follows: (1) Those responsible for causing the trouble during the crackdown on smuggling will be dealt with according to the law, and strict orders will be given to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. (2) A small number of rioters have taken advantage of this incident to engage in actions that endanger public security. The Garrison Headquarters has implemented temporary martial law to protect order. Once the situation has been calmed down, the martial law order will be lifted.

People's Demands

Starting from the morning of March 1st, there was still a chorus of beating sounds, and public enterprises and government employees' dormitories continued to be destroyed. They left no stone unturned, doing their best to "beat" and "destroy." At 10 AM, the Taipei City Council invited National Assembly representatives, provincial senators, councilors, and others to form a committee to deal with the bloody incident of the crackdown on smuggling. The inaugural meeting was held at Zhongshan Hall, presided over by Speaker Zhou Yanshou, who stated: This committee should endeavor to accept the demands of the citizens and convey them to the government in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution to this case. The attendees enthusiastically expressed their opinions, and as a result, it was decided to send representatives Provincial Assembly Speaker Huang Chao-chin, Taipei City Council Speaker Zhou Yanshou, Provincial Senator Wang Tian-deng, and Councilor and Radio Station Director Lin Zhong to meet with Governor Chen at the Governor-General's Office and present five demands: (1) Immediately lift martial law, (2) Release the arrested citizens, (3) Order the military police not to fire, (4) Organize a joint committee of officials and civilians to handle the matter, and (5) Request Governor Chen to broadcast to the public. Governor Chen immediately agreed to the demands. Regarding the first point, he would convene various agencies to discuss the lifting of martial law before 4 PM. Regarding the second point, the release of arrested citizens would be guaranteed by the fathers, elder brothers, neighborhood chiefs of the arrested citizens. The third, fourth, and fifth points were agreed to. As for the citizens who were killed and injured by the smuggling crackdown on the evening of the 27th, the Garrison Headquarters immediately sent a letter to the Taipei City Council stating that the authorities had decided to allocate 200,000 Taiwan dollars for compensation and 50,000 Taiwan dollars for the injured, and requested that it be conveyed to the claimants for collection.

### After the Liberation of Yan'an, Where Did the Communist Army Flee?

â€” Jinan, 20th [Day], Air Dispatch, Special Correspondent Li Tian

After twelve years of arduous management, Yan'an, regarded as the "nerve center" by the Chinese Communists, was forced to be abandoned after a week of defensive counterattacks by five Nationalist divisions, and fled in panic northward. This not only fully demonstrates the invincible and unconquerable strength of the Nationalist army, but also proves the weak and vulnerable nature of the Communist army. Since March and April, the Chinese Communists have repeatedly emphasized their determination to "defend Greater Yan'an." They did not expect that "Greater Yan'an" would be quietly abandoned within a week. On this point, the Chinese Communists can no longer use the same excuses as in the past, such as abandoning Zhangjiakou, Siping Street, Changchun, and Linyi, to cover up their military failures. "Strategic retreat, annihilate the Nationalist army, preserve strength, and not focus on gains and losses in one point or one line." So, where did the Chinese Communists go after abandoning Yan'an?

Targets of Attack

According to the observations and analyses of several famous military experts, their conclusions are almost identical: the possible targets of attack by the Communist army in the future are: (1) Taiyuan, (2) Changchun, (3) Jinan, (4) Qingdao, and (5) Baoding. Of course, if their military strength allows and there is an opportunity, the Communist army may launch offensives against the above five places or several places simultaneously, but the probability of capturing Taiyuan is the highest.

The Importance of Taiyuan

According to General Chen's recent report, the headquarters of the Communist army may have retreated to northwestern Shanxi. Therefore, the main force of the Communist army in northern Shaanxi today, in addition to using a minimum number of troops to contain and delay the advance of the Nationalist army north from Yan'an, is likely to concentrate in central Shanxi at the fastest speed, and even join forces with Liu Bocheng's Song Renqiong (commander of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region), Chen Geng (commander of the Taihang Military Region), Wang Xinting (commander of the Taiyue Military Region), Nie Rongzhen (commander of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military Region), and Yao Zhe (commander of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Military Region), who have already crossed the Yellow River and fled north, to besiege Taiyuan in central and western Shanxi. Shanxi is rich in resources, unlike the barren north of Shaanxi. The strategic and political importance of Taiyuan is also much greater than that of Yan'an, which is located in a remote corner. If Taiyuan is captured, it can not only regain face after abandoning Yan'an, but also control Shanxi, move east out of Niangziguan, attack Baoding, threaten Peiping and Tianjin, and move north to Datong and Zhangjiakou to restore its corridor to Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union. At the same time, it can send out small groups to harass the rear of the Nationalist army in Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, contain the Nationalist army's strength, disrupt rear traffic, and disturb rear order. Then, with its main force, it can prepare to choose a time and place in the Shanxi-Hebei border area that it deems appropriate (just as Zhu De said, when the Communist army's strength has expanded to be balanced with the Nationalist army) to carry out a decisive battle with the Nationalist army. This is the most advantageous move for the Communist army at present, and it is also the wishful thinking that it has always had in mind.

Avoiding Hard Nuts

Changchun is the heart of Northeast China, and its importance is far greater than that of Harbin and Jiatai. The Communist army has launched two spring offensives and suffered setbacks. However, because the Communist army in that area has more convenient and advantageous geographical conditions for receiving supplies and reinforcements than any other area in the country, it is possible that it will launch a third attack. Baoding is the capital of Hebei Province, and it is also possible that the Communist army will attack it. Jinan and Qingdao are currently large strongholds of the Nationalist army in isolated counties. Chen Yi is now concentrating his main force along the Jiaoji Railway, and his intentions are obvious. However, as of the time this reporter is writing this article, the renewed offensive against Jinan has not yet stopped. Qingdao is the location of the US Navy and a place of international concern. Although there is no determination to attack or occupy it, at least if the Communist army occupies Qingdao's water source, it will cause a lot of trouble for the residents there. Other places such as Datong (the Communist army may attack Datong with a part of its force while attacking Taiyuan, in order to prevent Fu Zuoyi's troops from rushing to the rescue), Zhangjiakou, and Guisui may also be attacked. As for Peiping and Tianjin, the Nationalist army's defenses are currently strong, and the Communist army has always avoided hard nuts, so the possibility of them being attacked is the smallest. The above is a view based primarily on the Communist army.

Military Focus

Under the strong counterattack of the Nationalist army, this attempt by the Communist army is precisely the best opportunity for the Nationalist army to annihilate its main force. If we take the Nationalist army as the main focus, then, as Chief of Staff Chen said, "The military focus in the future should be in Shandong." The Nationalist army's northward forces are being divided into three army corps, led by Tang Enbo, Ou Zhen, and Wang Jingjiu, and are advancing simultaneously from Linyi, Yanzhou, and Juye. On the left flank, because it is the plain of southwestern Shandong, the advance is faster. The vanguard has crossed Ningyang Wenshang, crossed the Da Wen River, and advanced north to the outskirts of Tai'an. On the railway front, it has reached the vicinity of Dawenkou. On the right flank, it is also gradually advancing north from Linyi. On one side, it is also carrying out encirclement and suppression operations with the Nationalist army advancing east from Qufu against the more than 10,000 Communist troops entrenched in Sishui and the Phoenix Mountain southeast of Sishui, as well as the two divisions (New Seventh Division, New Tenth Division) in Liangqiu southwest of Feixian. After this area is cleared, the threats to the flanks and rear of the Nationalist army on the right flank and the main front will be eliminated, and they can then calmly advance north. After the left flank of Wang Jingjiu's army corps formally joins forces with Wang Yaowu in Jinan, the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway will be opened, and then the Jiaoji Railway will be opened (at a minimum, the Jinan-Zhangdian Zibo line should be opened first). Then, together with the Tang and Ou army corps, the encirclement of the Yimeng Mountains will be gradually narrowed and annihilated.

A Migratory Existence

Based on the current situation, it can be judged that the Shandong Communists have transported their families and cumbersome supplies north of the Yellow River (but not the military forces). It seems that if the attempt to resist the encirclement and suppression of the Nationalist army fails, some of the Communist forces may retreat to Jiaodong as a last resort. (On the 19th of this month, the water level of the Yellow River at Beiluokou in Jinan rose to 1.02 meters, with a depth of 3.9 meters, a flow rate of 1.14 meters per second, and a surface width of 72.08 meters. The waves are turbulent, and the water volume is continuing to increase. Therefore, if the Jiaoji Railway is reopened by the Nationalist army, it will not be easy for the Communist army in the Yimeng Mountains to cross the Yellow River and flee north before winter.) Similarly, the Nationalist army's strongholds in Qihe, Yancheng, and Sangzidian, etc., outside Jinan on the north bank of the Yellow River, may suffer losses at the hands of the Communist army in the short term due to the difficulty of reinforcements. Some of the Communist forces may disguise themselves as ordinary people and go into hiding among the people, becoming underground forces that attack the Nationalist army. Most of them will probably make use of their light and rapid equipment to break up into smaller units, break through the encirclement at any time, and relive their so-called 25,000-mile Long March of migratory existence. On the surface, they are carrying the golden signboard of Marxist-Leninist communism, but in essence, they are just like Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, going wherever they can, killing wherever they go, living wherever they stay, and eating wherever they can.

### Recent Trends in American Literature: The Rise of the Novella

â€” Li Dongfang

Early last September, on the deck of the General Meigs, my old classmate Mr. Wu Zuxiang and I talked for about an hour about the novella. He is a leading expert on novellas in China. This conversation was arranged with him beforehand specifically to discuss the novella, nothing else, and without the knowledge or participation of any third party. â€“ Very mysterious.

Because of my lack of foundational knowledge, I was completely ignorant. Even though he tried his best to make me understand, I still regret not having received a full explanation. What exactly is a novella? How should it be written or appreciated?

After arriving in the United States, many short stories pleased me, but many also displeased me. Long novels are relatively easy to find satisfying, but many also made me close the book and sigh, frankly because the content was not good. â€“ I seem to be concluding that all novellas are good.

This statement is, of course, somewhat of an exaggeration. However, it is a fact that more novellas are good than bad, while more short and long novels are bad than good.

Perhaps it is because the length is just right, making it easier for editors to appreciate and select them, so the ones that get chosen for publication are unlikely to be that bad. Readers unknowingly support good writers for the same reason.

Modern life is too busy to allow spending seven or eight hours, or two lots of seven or eight hours, to finish a long novel (around 300 pages). Modern life is also too complex, making seamlessly simple themes seem childish and shallow.

This is another reason for the popularity of the novella.

The novella, of course, falls between the short story and the long novel in terms of length. If someone believes that the novella emphasizes differences in content and nature, and can be shorter than the 5,000-word standard for short stories or longer than the 300-page (75,000-word) standard for long novels, they are, of course, free to express their opinion. However, I am not sure if they are intentionally trying to be different and superior or if they are misleading young people. In terms of nature, the novella also falls between the two, possessing the strengths of both. It focuses on a specific point, like a short story, but it tells the story in a leisurely and unhurried manner, similar to a long novel. It can hold the reader's attention from beginning to end, but it is not too simple or childish because, in addition to a central theme, it can also include several secondary plots that can both enhance the story and make it more realistic.

For this reason, it is popular in America today.

The more important magazines each have one novella per issue. These magazines, of course, also have several short stories. But I dare say that short stories can be good or bad, while novellas cannot afford to be bad: editors dare not choose a bad one. Take the Red Book (which doesn't discuss red politics), which sells over two million copies a month, for example. The same goes for its sister publication, Blue Book (specifically for men, while Red Book is enjoyed by both men and women). As for the Saturday Evening Post, which can be bought in major cities across China, the same is true. Many people buy it every week just to read the novella in it. Collier's, American, Cosmopolitan, Lady's Home Companion, Fortune, and so on, all do the same.

An American novella writer of note, Ms. Helen Hull, like Mr. Wu Zuxiang, is reluctant to give the novella a definitive definition. She said, "The story I wrote, 'Snow in Summer,' I initially wanted to write as a short story, about a man who suddenly becomes famous and doesn't know what to do. How new hopes cannot adapt to the old environment is what I wanted to write about. Later, I thought it would be better to make the protagonist a woman, and it would be best if she became famous for writing a book, rather than winning an award like the man I originally wanted to write about. It would be best if this woman was also a housewife with many children and a husband with a strong sense of career and self-respect, such as a dentist. How would her husband react when she suddenly received a notification from the bookstore that her book had been selected as the recipient of a publishing prize? I also wanted to write about her as a housewife living in a small town, so how would the neighbors and people in the street gossip about this and be jealous of her? Then she would have to leave, leave the small town, even leave her unhappy husband (because his annual income is not as much as this prize). And after she leaves, another young lady would sympathize with this innocent dentist â€“ this becomes a novella.

But Helen Hull is kind, so when this novel was written, the heroine did not break up with her husband. The husband surrendered out of admiration. Therefore, there was no need to add a sympathetic third party who took advantage of the situation.

I categorize Helen Hull's view under the heading of "Knowing is Difficult, Doing is Easy." People who act often "act according to what their heart finds peace in," knowing what is, but not knowing why. (This statement does not include my old friend.)

I especially love reading Peter Paul O'Mara's "Let Yesterday Go!" Yesterday is Anne Darford's gray memories of living with her father, and her yellow memories of later being with a scientist. The affectionate Dr. Lenott both help her to let yesterday become yesterday.

Her father, Huntley, lived with her without servants, and did not let her read because they were too poor. Her father did not socialize with anyone and was very frugal. The father and daughter were so poor that they could only eat vegetarian food. Anne even hid in the kitchen to eat bread with cold water, not even daring to eat the vegetarian food, saving it for her sick and bad-tempered father.

After her father died, only a few people attended the funeral, including Dr. Lenott and lawyer Spale. When the lawyer visited her that evening, Miss Anne knew that he was coming to talk about her father's debts and ask her to move out of the house, etc. Who knew that Spale the lawyer would tell her that her father was very rich, with several houses in addition to $200,000 in cash, and that the entire will was for her. â€“ This made Anne hate her dead father.

Dr. Lenott advised her to go to New York to study and work, to pursue a bright tomorrow. After a few months of depression, she got used to it and was very happy. Dr. Lenott shouldn't have taken the train to visit specifically to raise $20,000 for a scientist. She was very unhappy. But afterward, she allocated the money anyway. Lenott still returned to his small town to practice medicine.

The scientist himself came to New York, and in addition to thanking her, he hoped to get a little more. She did not promise to give more money, but after repeated entanglement, she allowed him to kiss her. He was such a rude, simple, and selfish person, why could she be so compliant? Why did she abandon Dr. Lenott completely?

Mr. O'Mara, who wrote the novel, doesn't blame her at all. Dr. Lenott doesn't blame her either. She had wasted her childhood and half of her youth, and she was already twenty-seven years old this year! We can only feel slightly unfair.

Fortunately, the scientist was excessively rude, liked to drink, and even fought with the waiter in the restaurant, which suddenly made her decide to dump him and become very close to Dr. Lenott, who happened to have arrived in New York. The second yesterday also went to its place.

The novella is interesting precisely because its flavor is sometimes strong and sometimes weak.

### Love

â€” Zhuang Cun

"Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith." - Solomon

From ancient and simple, or desolate and lonely mountain villages, from foggy or smoky cities, from distant or nearby different areas: you send these letters with the same affectionate feelings, making me feel a pleasant burning, making me have the pain after the burning.

With trembling hands, I tear open your letter envelopes, wiping away tears, letting your black, blue, red... one by one, star-like words, jump into my eyes. Under the dim light, I stop breathing, wringing out the crystallization of your emotions, I read, laughing; I read, cryingâ€¦

Your love! Like warm holy water, flowing through my heart, frozen in December, and in the furnace of my emotions, with your love, it is like having burning coal; it shoots out brilliant sparks, the sharp flames illuminating my ordinary life.

â€“ I have been so moved by the love of your sincere conscience that I have had several sleepless nights!

Some say that they live for friendship, and I too, with your kind love, have the determination and perseverance to step into the thicket of thorns. On the road where suffering grows like weeds, I have never stopped or looked back, regretting the traces of blood I left behind on the road I have traveled. Nor have I ever felt troubled or tired by this arduous and long journey.

Just as days without the sun make me curse, I cannot live a day without love. I came into this world for love and to be loved. If the people around me are all emotionally numb, iron-like beings whom I cannot love or be loved by, then I will be like a fish without water: suffocating to death, suffocating to death!

I don't know if love can be selfish? I seem to be like someone who embezzles for money; I greedily absorb people's love. I would rather be like a broken ship, letting the raging waves smash and sink in the overflowing sea of love; I would rather be like a moth drawn to a flame, dying on the sparks of love or being burned to death in the boiling oil of love.

Those who know how to love and how to be loved also know how to live. Those who love everyone and are loved by everyone are exceptionally happy. They live in days with sunshine and flowers, without any unnecessary worries or troubles. No matter how great the suffering, they can overcome it. No matter how great the blow, they have the courage to resist it. The more calamities come, the more they sing. The deeper they hate, the deeper they love... How is their life tempting me!

And I, who am overflowing with emotions, have the same heat and integrity. I don't want any of you to unreasonably abandon me. That is more cruel than a mother abandoning her dead child, more cruel than a man abandoning his wife, more cruel than making me fall into extreme hunger, more unbearable.

A child living in love and hate said: "If others don't love me, I would rather die than live... To receive sincere love from the people I truly love is to let a bull trample me and break my arm; or stand behind a kicking horse and let its hoof kick my chest, I am willing to endure..." How much this child values â€‹â€‹the love of others! Her words are a cry for love, and also my cry!

Today, I want to tell you with tears that I live for your love. If you are stingy with your emotions, if youâ€¦ then you are intentionally raising your hand to kill your brother, then you have an unforgivable guilt in your conscience.

My hand, extended here: those who love me, those who are loved by me, come! I want you to hold it tightly! Hold it tightly.

### Jessie's Letter

â€” Feng Li

I know Wei, and I know Jessie. I also know and understand Wei and Jessie's love. They are both very frank with me and have never hidden or concealed anything.

Jessie was still a senior at FT University when Wei was a senior when Jessie was a freshman. After Wei left school, Jessie often wrote to him.

Wei is the oldest of Jessie's boyfriends. Jessie has never loved a younger boy. She hates women who fall in love with younger men. She feels that kind of love is cruel and should be cursed. Anyone who has read "La Dame aux CamÃ©lias" will sympathize with Marguerite, but Jessie is the exception. She does not want to sympathize with her. Unfortunately, this time their school performed "La Dame aux CamÃ©lias" and Jessie was assigned to play Marguerite. When Jessie discovered that the actor playing Armand was a freshman named Lu Bo, she felt very disappointed. But as a result, she loved Lu Bo, and gradually forgot about Wei.

Here are a few of my favorite letters from Jessie among the many letters that Wei recently showed me. One of them is for Lu Bo, and one is for Director Lu. According to Wei's speculation, Jessie was probably too busy with rehearsals, and in a hurry, she mistakenly put the letters to other people into the envelopes for him. Although he is very forgiving of Jessie, I understand a young girl's feelings even more. Coincidentally, the editor of this magazine asked for a manuscript, and for a while there was nothing to submit, so I obtained Wei's consent and copied and sent it to fulfill my obligation. I think Jessie, who has always been known for being frank and generous, wouldn't object, right?

Because I dare not take credit for others' work, I hereby explain the situation above.

(1) Dear Wei:

I have good news to tell you, our school is putting on a play. Mr. Lu selected "La Dame aux CamÃ©lias" and assigned me to play Marguerite. Mr. Lu is so great, he let me play such a good role.

I am often tired of my ordinary life. I want to escape this life and find the life in books, and also want to taste the life of an artist.

I am so excited, I seem to have a lot to say, but I can't find a word that can write out what I want to say.

Wishing you sweet dreams!

â€”Jessie

(2) My Dear Wei:

Our play is already in rehearsal. I discovered that the male actor playing Armand is a Freshman, his name is Lu Bo, he is a very handsome and cute young man, I like him, but I don't like him playing my lover Armand, because he is too young, he is even younger than my brother! How can I play a romance with him!

â€”Your Jessie

(3) Dear Bo:

Thank you for the new ideas that are as bright as sunshine that you have given me. They have rekindled my old feelings. May you always keep your newness.

â€”Your Honest Jessie

(4) Dear Teacher:

I don't know how artists live their lives. They perform two shows every day. How can they enjoy their own lives in the little time they have left!

I hate theater life, it destroys my friendship of love. Now I have understood the love between Marguerite and Armand. Rehearsing one show a day is enough to make me forget myself. I have forgotten that I am Jessie.

### Ibsen's Debut Work

â€” Fu Bo

When Ibsen was twenty years old, he was still working as an apprentice in a drugstore in Grimstad. The spread of European revolutionary thought ignited his young heart, so he stole time under the candlelight at night to engage in revolutionary creation. His debut work, "Catiline" (Katilina), is a three-act tragic poem.

At the age of twenty-two, he published it at his own expense, selling only thirty copies. He used the pen name "BrynjÃ³lf Bjarme".

### Short Maxims

â€” Translated by Chen Yin

A clever woman should sometimes leave her husband for a while to make him miss her good points, but not leave for too long lest he find consolation elsewhere.

When a woman starts to hide her age, she has already revealed her age.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 209

â€” Ye Jingfeng

"Very good, you really should rest for a while."

"But you'll have to bother to tell that maid to wake me up at half past nine."

"Sleep for another half hour, I'll come at ten o'clock, we still have to discuss the formal program." She had another idea.

Tsurumi didn't really sleep. After breakfast with Pingzi, he returned to his room, closed the door, lay on the large soft couch behind the window, constantly smoking cigarettes, with that note still in his hand.

"0915!"

The words "Hua Mao Hotel" were simple. You only need to ask someone to know what location and what kind of place it is. Only this number is very peculiar. He believed it was definitely not a room number. How could a hotel have such a large number? No, maybe it's room 915 on the first floor? Maybe this hotel has so many rooms? Impossible. Or is it room 15 on the ninth floor? What does this "0" mean? And why is the action so mysterious?

In such a large Wansui Hall, there are only two telephones, and they are both in the manager's room. Tsurumi didn't want to disturb anyone, let alone let people know about such a thing.

"0915," Tsurumi read the number backwards. New place, new people! Everything is so displeasing. He also thought of the boy who threw the paper ball: his face was so dark, his clothes were so tattered, but his teeth were so neat and white; and his actions were quiet, calm, agile, and natural. Speaking, throwing the paper ball, saluting, turning around and slipping away, each step and action was in order, and of course, planned.

"Why didn't I get out of the car to chase him?... Why didn't the car attendant notice? True, he was busy moving the suitcases, his brain was simple, his perception was dull, and he was focused on service. After placing the suitcases, he had to hurry to drive the car. He couldn't do two things at once, right?..."

"But why didn't I get out of the car to chase him at the time?" Tsurumi questioned himself; the more he thought about it, the more confused he became. After being confused for a while, he tried his best to recall the scene when he got into the car; recalling, fiercely recalling. After guessing for a long time, he finally got a few answers.

He believed that his actions were correct: he did not have a violent reaction to the boy's actions. First, he wanted to maintain a calm attitude and not be surprised by strange things; had he experienced fewer strange things in the Northeast and in Japan? Why make a fuss over a trifle? He believed that the first reason for not getting out of the car to chase the boy was due to the calmness that had been cultivated through past experience, which prevented his hasty reaction.

This point is also plausible. Then are there other reasons? Maybe because he was too tired? Originally, he hadn't had a good rest in a week. In Tokyo, in that tense environment, whether awake or asleep, his nerves absolutely couldn't rest. Returning to the Northeast, returning to Peiping, constant setbacks, constant new problems, one after another, troubles and confusions grew in his heart like weeds. In addition, there was also the warmth of his comrades, endless stories, endless reports. Even in sleep, his nerves were excited. He was not a steel robot, after tension, stimulation, distress, and excitement, there was also a long journey of about ten hours. No one would believe that he was not tired. He was really tired, so naturally all reactions were slow.

The reason for being tired also seems plausible, but it still cannot completely convince himself.

"That's right!" He thought of another reason: He remembered that Pingzi asked him "What is this thing?" His view was "Probably no malice." Perhaps it was this view that stopped his usual violent reaction?

However, why did he have this view at the time? Although he was taken aback, wasn't Pingzi also greatly surprised? Pingzi didn't advocate interrogating the boy, naturally because of his attitude and answer, which was as cold as ice. However, what is the reason why he was unmoved when he saw a cooperative woman being frightened? Yes, maybe he was afraid that a violent action would result in Pingzi being even more frightened. For example, if that young fellow pulled out a gun and shot twice, or even threw a small bomb, and it exploded with a loud bang, wouldn't things be worse? Wouldn't Pingzi be even more panicked?

Free Talk

### Random Chat by Du Bo

â€” Wang Cong

One summer, a child was sweating profusely from the heat. The "smart" mother dragged the child to the courtyard to bask in the sun, supposedly to dry the sweat on his clothes.

This clever idea may have been successful at times, but unfortunately, this child was not blessed. Before his clothes could be dried, he lay on the ground dying. The mother waved her fan, walked out, and sighed:

"This child is really lazy, how did he fall asleep?"

If the above makes you laugh, it may be a joke.

A joke becomes a joke because the person telling the joke doesn't laugh himself.

Some people haven't even started telling a joke, and they start laughing a lot themselves. In this way, others may also laugh, but what's funny is not the joke, but that inexplicable silly laugh.

Mr. Ludwig, a contemporary commentator and biographer, has a few valuable words, he said:

"If two people are watching an opera, one sitting in the first row of a box and the other sitting in the gallery, their impressions of the same opera will be as different as the impressions of the same era between a contemporary observer and a historical researcher. Both have their advantages. The person below can listen to the actor's voice undisturbed, hear his breathing, and see his characteristic performances, thus knowing more about the hero in the play than others; but the other person can see the whole play unfold on the stage."

This is a very valuable passage. When we observe everything, whether it is current politics or other aspects, we must always keep two seats. One below, one in the gallery, and often switch seats to watch in the same scene.

In Vienna, on March 14, 1827, at the end of Beethoven's letter to Moscheles, Romain Rolland wrote a footnote after checking the documents:

"Beethoven was almost penniless at this time. He wrote to the London Philharmonic Society and Moscheles, who was in England at the time, asking them to organize a concert for him to raise money. The London Philharmonic Society generously sent him one hundred pounds immediately as an advance, and Beethoven was deeply moved. According to a friend, when he received this letter, he clasped his hands together and burst into tears of joy and gratitude. Everyone present was heartbroken and moved. The old wound burst open again, but he still wanted to read the letter and have someone write a letter to thank the generous Englishmen for sharing his tragic fate. He promised them to compose a large piece of music; the Tenth Symphony, an overture, and whatever they specified. He said: "I will write those pieces of music with a love in my heart that I have never had before." This reply letter was written on March 18, and he died on the 26th of the same month." (Fully based on the translation by Chuan Lei)

This great and always reserved musical saint; the darkness of the human world, the inner loneliness is knowable. He finally accepted the generosity of others. For a mere one hundred pounds, he would burst into tears of joy and gratitude. This just shows that this human world is too devoid of warmth; even a slight echo makes the sensitive poet unknowingly excited.

### Concerning Material Allotment

â€” Ding Ren

It is a universally acknowledged fact that the lives of general public educators are difficult. For many years, they have endured hardship and stood at their respective posts, shouldering the heavy responsibility of supporting the country. Their contributions cannot be considered small. However, their meager income is often less than that of a rickshaw puller, which cannot help but make one feel sorry for them.

After the victory, everyone received salaries according to the cost-of-living index. However, public educators were still paid based on a government-determined multiple of a base number. For example, with a base salary of eighty yuan, the multiple was only around three thousand. How could this compete with the skyrocketing prices? Although there was a provision for adjustment every three months, the adjusted salary often lagged behind the price increases. Although the government recently implemented measures to allocate materials, we feel that the assistance to general public educators is still not practical enough, especially for low-level civil servants. Instead, it has become a burden. Taking today's (26th) published allocation of goods as an example, items such as rice, oil, salt, sugar, coal briquettes, and clothâ€”if you want to buy them all, then one month's income is definitely not enough to cover these "materials." If I were a civil servant in this situation, I would have to swallow my tears.

Now, let's take a step back and discuss the matter objectively. In addition to the possibility that the allocation of materials may lead to the neglect of the three-month salary adjustment, we cannot help but offer some opinions regarding the potential abuses that may arise from the allocation itself:

First, the establishment of special agencies for the allocation of materials adds a large amount of overhead. Whether this is a reasonable plan, we cannot say.

Second, the allocation has increased the number of people in businesses outside the three hundred and sixty traditional tradesâ€”those who buy allocation tickets. As a result, civil servants are distracted from their work and spend their days calculating ticket prices and listening to market news. We can already predict these phenomena today. The impact on administrative efficiency cannot be ignored.

Third, it is possible that in the future, there will be instances of inflated reporting and deductions at lower levels during the distribution of allocation tickets.

Fourth, the quality of the materials may cause a lot of trouble for everyone.

On the eve of the upcoming allocation, we offer these humble opinions for the authorities to seriously consider and carefully handle. It will probably not be without benefit.

### Miscellaneous Notes Under the Lamp

â€” Mei Bai

Before 1939, a total of thirty-three countries in the world had women's suffrage. Fourteen more countries have been added since then, and now women in forty-seven countries have the right to vote. However, women in eighteen countries, including Argentina, Belgium, and Switzerland, still do not have the right to vote. There is an ancient saying in our country: "A short separation is better than a new marriage." The Swedish government seems to agree with this, as it recently passed a law stipulating that every married woman is entitled to ten days of vacation each year. If her husband cannot be by her side during these ten days, the government can provide all the expenses for her vacation.

There is a radio station in Mexico City called XEOK. This station is the only commercial radio station in the world that does not have any programming. It announces the time once every minute, twenty-four hours a day. However, in addition to the few seconds of time announcement, the radio station still has a wide variety of commercials every minute. Because each advertisement takes a very short time and has many variations, the business is still booming.

Horses also often get seasick. Many fine steeds need to rest for five or six months after a sea voyage before they can gallop again. Recently, some horse racing enthusiasts in the United States specially sent a plane to Ireland to transport six excellent breeds to Los Angeles. This is the first time that horses have flown across the Atlantic.

The biggest payout in the history of horse racing occurred on October 30, 1935, at Newmarket in England. A spectator bought a double-win ticket for six dimes and won a prize of $11,650! (Translated from Collier's magazine, etc.)

### An Anecdote of the Great Era: Animals Cannot Escape the Disaster

â€” Ya Mu

The Taipei incident has now passed like a storm.

It goes without saying that many compatriots have suffered and been frightened. What no one expected was that even the animals, large and small, in the homes of people from other provinces, as well as the livestock in the zoo, were not cared for or fed because their owners or managers were fleeing. At the same time, they could not run away, so they had to endure many days of hunger, thus experiencing the most serious threat of death.

If these animals had consciousness, sensitivity, and could speak, I wonder what they would say.

This is truly a small anecdote of the great era! In short, it is inevitable that chickens and dogs will be restless in a storm. If animals had knowledge, they would inevitably feel that it is difficult to be an animal.

### Neon Lights Shine

â€” Yun

In the past, due to power conservation, except for the four large characters "Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame" on the roof of the International Hotel, all other outdoor neon lights were not allowed to shine.

From April 1st, because the power supply is relatively abundant, outdoor neon lights can also be opened.

Without outdoor neon lights, walking on the street at night is gloomy, dark, and desolate. It feels like the market is so bleak and so desolate.

Now outdoor neon lights can shine brightly again, but does this mean that the market has prospered again?

Film Talk

### "Umbrellas of Cherbourg"

â€” Wubian

None of the films produced by "Zhongda Hua" are above average. Regardless of the script, performance, or technology, this "Umbrellas of Cherbourg" is another sloppy and inferior film.

The screenwriter, Shi Lin, simply wrote this story inexplicably. The emptiness and childishness of the content make people laugh and cry. The main characters in the play, He Ping and the old judge, etc., all have inexplicable contradictions, especially the old judge. The development of the plot is even more childishly laughable. The police's pursuit of the fugitive is completely hide-and-seek. Plane tickets can be bought casually in the countryside. He Ping catches the murderous robber and then releases him. The judge's niece falls in love with the fugitive at first sight... Examples such as these are simply absurd to the point of disbelief. Such a story, detached from reality, was rarely seen in civilization plays even ten years ago.

The performance is also a series of clumsy comic strips, coupled with the incompetence of the director, Zheng Xiaoqiu. He simply does not understand film techniques, let alone the use of directing methods. He only desperately grabs some low-level gimmicks to stuff to the audience, resulting in the entire film progressing like a clumsy and verbose old woman telling a smelly and disgusting story.

The editing, photography, and recording are bad to the point of being unwatchable. All the actors speak Cantonese Mandarin, and 60% of the dialogue is unintelligible. After watching this film, it is impossible to believe that it is a brand new film.

Because the script and director determine the fate of the actors, Li Qing, Rong Xiaoyi, and Rong Yuyi, who had better achievements in the past, are all gone in "Umbrellas of Cherbourg." What is left is only the clumsiest acting.

### Integrity, Prudence, Diligence

â€” Chen Dexing

The Elementary Education says: "The way to be an official, there are only three words, namely, integrity, prudence, and diligence. Knowing these three, then you know how to maintain yourself!" Someone explains: "Integrity is incorruptibility, prudence is adherence to etiquette, and diligence is loyalty to duty." Please see how many officials today possess all three qualities? I hope the government's performance evaluation uses these three words as the standard; and I further hope that officials at all levels constantly examine and restrain themselves with these three words!

### Justice Resides in People's Hearts

â€” Yue Feng

The sinking of the Fubo warship is just a wave in the recent tide of large-scale accidents at sea, land, and air. It's nothing strange. What distinguishes it from other accidents is that the Fubo was a gift from Britain and has not yet been properly used. Now that I think about it, we are really ashamed to have received it. British Navy official, Bowyer Todd, even sent a telegram of condolences, further increasing our shame.

However, the most lamentable is the hundred and several dozen officers and soldiers, especially those young trainees. They gave up their studies and joined the navy, but now their ambitions have not been fulfilled, and they are buried at the bottom of the sea. It is too unfair. The ancients said, "Death can be lighter than a feather or heavier than Mount Tai." What kind of death is theirs?

Now is the time to investigate responsibility. In terms of navigation technology, the captain of the _____ steamer claims that he made no mistakes. He strictly followed the navigation route. Although he clearly saw the other party entering his own lane, he could continue sailing forward because he had not made any mistakes. The responsibility for the accident did not lie with him. This reminds me of an incident where a cat somehow crawled under a tram on the road and was trapped between the crisscrossing iron bars, unable to escape. If the tram started, the cat would definitely die. After it died, the driver would of course not be responsible. However, the driver and the ticket seller, disregarding their duty to arrive on time and ignoring their undoubtedly great right to drive forward, spent a lot of time, and two or three people got greasy and dirty, finally dragging the damn cat out, watching it jump and bound home, and then, amid the joy of the passengers and passersby, they started the tram. Comparing these two, it is really far off to wonder what the value of workers not understanding rights and obligations is.

In addition to technical issues, there is also the issue of rescue. This is the point that the families of the victims intend to accuse the Hai Min steamship of. It is said that the passengers on the Hai Min ship expressed indignation and spoke out against injustice for the dead. However, in the conversations of some passengers, we cannot see anything. This makes us confused. Does justice reside in "people's hearts" but cannot appear in "people's mouths"?

### French film star, Sifrre, was famous in the art world before the war. He was captured by the Germans during the war, and it was repeatedly rumored that he was no longer alive. It was not until the end of the war that it was known that the rumors were false. Today, Mr. Sifrre has gone to New York to perform a four-week dance performance. The picture shows Mr. Sifrre talking with Hollywood stars Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer before his performance at the Miller Theater.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

â€” Qin Shouou

At this time, countless fantasies had densely covered Lan's meninges, completely reaching a state of being unable to see or hear. She hated Feifei's rashness in sneaking out alone at night to find the coppersmith whom she absolutely could not find. At the same time, she deeply loved the innocence and loveliness of the seven-year-old girl, who dared to venture out at night in such an unfamiliar place to repair a toy. She worried that she would be abducted by bad people, and she worried that she would lose her life in the bombing and strafing of enemy planes. She also felt sorry for Zhu Zhaonian, her lover whom she had loved eleven years ago. She feared that he had been bombed to death with Feifei; or that Feifei had returned unharmed, but old Zhu had been too eager to run around searching and had not taken shelter in the air-raid shelter, resulting in an accident. She also blamed herself for staying in Guilin to wait for the arrival of a slim hope of a remittance, resulting in such an unfortunate event, and also meeting old Zhu, who had long been rumored to have died.

Although her marriage to Hu Juewen was not entirely based on love, their relationship had been very good for ten years. Juewen had also been extremely loyal to her, and his tireless spirit of immersing himself in research all year round made her admire him from the bottom of her heart. And the clever Feifei and Xiao Rong also added a lot of harmonious and pleasant air to the family. After this separation of three years, Lan could not deny that she missed Juewen somewhat, even though this bookworm was still so poor and so inept at planning for his wife and children.

In the anxious and fearful waiting, Lan had also blamed Juewen's muddleheadedness. If he could have waited for them in Guilin for two more months, how good things would have been! Feifei would not have been lost! Zhu Zhaonian would not have been encountered.

In her confusion and bewilderment, she suddenly noticed that the people around her were all standing up, and Xiao Rong's hand was also pushing her hard.

"It's over! The air-raid alarm has been lifted!" Only then did she hear people shouting clearly.

People surged out like a tide, and Xu Pangzi was also urging Ah Shi to leave quickly.

"Go back and quickly call the train station!" He was anxiously thinking about his wooden furniture.

"It's all right! Mrs. Hu, we'll guarantee that we'll see your little sister as soon as we get back!" Xiao Shen comforted Lan with great consideration, while reaching out to tuck in Rong'er, helping them, mother and son, squeeze out of the crowd.

This time, Rong'er did not resist him, only kept shouting, "Go out and find my sister! Go out and find my sister!"

"Thank you, Mr. Shen." Compared to Xu Pangzi, who was a relative, Xiao Shen was of course a warm-hearted person, so Lan thanked him all the way.

"It's all right, we're all family!" Xiao Shen said very proudly.

As they approached the entrance of the cave, Jin Aili, who had been separated from them for half a day, suddenly seemed very excited and jumped over, shouting:

"Mrs. Hu! Mrs. Hu!" (30)
