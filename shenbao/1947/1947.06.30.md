### The Entire Length of the Jichang Railway is Open; Forces Can Join Up in the Siping Area; Communist Forces in Western Liaoning Are Defeated and Turn to Attack Beipiao

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 29th] The Jichang Railway, which had been cut off by Communist forces for several days, was fully opened on the 29th. The Communist forces entrenched in Huapichang and Hewanzi, two locations on the eastern section of the railway, were successively defeated on this day by National forces advancing from Jilin and Jiutai, respectively. The National forces from the east and west officially joined forces near Hewanzi Station that afternoon. The Jichang Railway was severed on the 15th of this month. Currently, transportation authorities, together with the military, have begun to urgently repair the destroyed railway tracks, bridges, telephone poles and wires, and the Xiaofengman power transmission lines along the route. The resumption of traffic on the Jichang Railway is expected soon.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th] The National forces on the southern route recaptured Mengniushao, one station south of Siping, on the afternoon of the 29th. It is estimated that they will be able to join up with the Siping garrison by the morning of the 30th. The National forces on the northern route, after crossing the Dongliao River, have captured Guojia Township and are continuing to advance. That location was a relatively strong stronghold for the Communist forces resisting the National forces coming from the north. After the National forces broke through this point, they will be able to complete the mission of encircling Siping. The two armies in Siping are facing each other from east to west. Over the past 24 hours, they have continued to engage each other, but the situation has not changed significantly. They are urgently awaiting relief.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] According to a telephone call from Siping at 5:00 PM, the day's fighting was quiet. The military and civilians throughout the city enthusiastically built fortifications. At 2:30 PM, during a break, a burst of artillery fire suddenly came from the south of the city, followed by smaller bursts. Shortly after, the command headquarters confirmed that the artillery fire came from the reinforcements arriving from the south. The military and civilians throughout the city were overjoyed upon hearing the news.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 29th] According to Changtu telephone, the National forces are currently divided into sixteen routes, advancing towards Siping overnight under the moonlight. They should be able to join forces by dawn on the 30th.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 29th] The Siping battle, which had been quiet for 24 hours, became tense again last night. Starting at 9:00 PM, the Communist forces fired dense artillery fire at the defenders' positions. The artillery fire rumbled all night, and infantry charges were repelled by the defenders. It is widely believed that this is the last gasp before the Communist forces collapse. In addition, the Communist forces are launching a counterattack on the line south of Siping, fiercely resisting the National forces advancing north. Fierce battles are currently underway on the Shuangmiaotzu and Henggou Township line. The vanguard of the National forces, which had advanced to the southwest of Siping, is retreating westward south of Bamiancheng.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 29th] The Communist forces in western Liaoning failed to capture Chaoyang and are now moving troops eastward towards Beipiao, with a force of about ten thousand. They have now occupied Jinlingsi, the connecting point of the Miancheng Line to Beipiao, and have begun to besiege Beipiao. Beipiao has a large power plant that supplies electricity to the Fuxin coal mine and the Yixian and Jinxi areas. Fuxin produces 5,000 tons of coal per day, and there are currently 110,000 tons of coal waiting to be transported. Beipiao, on the other hand, has a smaller coal production volume.

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 29th] After suffering a defeat in Chaoyang, the Communist forces regrouped their troops and invaded Beipiao on the 28th, engaging in fierce battles with the local garrison. All of the railway bridges between Jinlingsi and Yixian were destroyed, and much of the railway was also dismantled. The National forces have dispatched troops from Jin County and Chaoyang along two routes to urgently provide reinforcements. In addition, the Communist forces that invaded Pingquan were completely defeated by the garrison on the 28th, and the remnants fled in disarray along their original route.

### The US Revokes the Arms Embargo on China; Has Significant Political Significance; The Truman Doctrine Begins to Apply to China

[Reuters, Nanjing, 29th] A senior official of the National Government privately met with a reporter from our agency today, believing that the United States' permission for China to purchase military supplies from the US is equivalent to applying the Truman Doctrine to China, and has significant political significance. He said: "Until now, US aid to China has been primarily economic aid focused on post-war recovery. The revocation of the arms embargo is an action taken after previously avoiding political involvement. It can be seen as the beginning of the application of the Truman Doctrine to China, and as an indication that the policy of halting arms aid to China, adopted during Marshall's mediation of the conflict between the Nationalists and Communists last year, has changed after a shift in the global situation. Asia is a greater threat to world peace than Europe, so it is appropriate for US foreign policy to increase its attention to Asia. This new US policy follows accusations from several government leaders, such as Sun Ke, that the Soviet Union is aiding the Chinese Communists. Therefore, it is not based on these statements, but rather on a long-term, close observation of China's political and military situation, that the decision was made to change President Truman's policy towards China, announced in 1945. The revocation of the arms embargo can make up for the disappointment felt by the general Chinese population after learning that the 500 million yuan loan would be revoked and reserved. The general Chinese public did not pay close attention to the development of the loan, nor did they have time to analyze it in detail, so they regarded the failure to extend the reservation period of the 500 million yuan loan as a moral blow to China. In fact, as far as I know, China has not applied to the United States for a political loan."

The general public in the capital believes that allowing China to purchase military supplies from the United States is of far greater importance than the sale of 13 million rounds of rifle bullets to China. At the same time, a well-respected official of the Ministry of National Defense told our agency that these 13 million rounds of bullets would not have a decisive impact on China's civil war. According to his personal estimate, these ammunition could last about three months, but it is better than nothing. From the government's point of view, this move can boost the morale of the front lines, especially the troops in the Northeast, who have felt the lack of ammunition.

Political observers here expect that this announcement from Washington will influence the National Government's issuance of a punitive expedition order against the Communist Party. This issue may be discussed tomorrow, when the joint meeting of the Central Political Committee and the Central Executive Committee will be held.

### US Policy Change Toward China

Predicted by Republican Newspaper

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 29th] The Republican newspaper "Oakland Tribune" predicted on June 26 that due to the current situation in China and the deteriorating crisis caused by the resurgence of the Communist forces, the United States would likely change its policy toward the Dong in the near future. The newspaper's editorial was titled "The Crisis in China". The editorial was published before the State Department issued a statement on the sale of arms and the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, Martin, issued a statement on the loan. The full text is as follows: The tragedy of China is approaching its climax, and the calls for aid to China are becoming increasingly urgent. The Chinese government, through Vice Chairman Sun Ke, has openly criticized the Soviet Union for assisting the advance of the Chinese Communists. Regardless of the Nanjing government's accusations, the facts seem to prove that the Soviet Union has adopted a new policy towards China's protests. Our assumption is as follows: that the Soviet Union has transferred the materials seized from the Japanese in the Northeast to the Chinese Communists. Semi-official Chinese sources have even explained in detail the aircraft, tanks, and armored vehicles supplied to the Chinese Communists. At the same time, although the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1945 stipulates China's rights to Lüda, the Soviet Union has now refused the Chinese government's legitimate right to take over Lüda. The reason for this refusal may be that these two ports are being used to supply war materials to the Chinese Communists. The Export-Import Bank's 500 million loan to China will expire on July 1, and Marshall has indicated in Washington that he will allow the deadline to pass without taking any action. In addition, there has been no indication that there will be other actions in the future. Due to the recent situation in China and the deteriorating crisis caused by the military resurgence of the Chinese Communists, we can expect a change in US policy. This change is expected to be realized in the near future.

### Future US Loans to China Will Be Used to Consolidate the Monetary System

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] A certain authoritative figure in the economic field told reporters on the eve of the expiration of the 500 million US dollar loan that future US loans to China would be based on the principle of frequency: the most important thing is to use them to stabilize finance and consolidate the monetary system. Under this principle, if there is a reasonable plan, the US can grant loans. The second principle is to develop both private enterprises and state-owned industries. After private manufacturers receive loans, they will naturally purchase raw materials from the US. If state-owned industries are developed, Sino-US trade can also develop accordingly. Based on the above approaches, the US can definitely continue to grant loans to China.

### Situation in Baoding Eases; National Forces Advance Southward to Relieve Dingxing

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 29th] The fighting in the suburbs of Baoding eased slightly last night. The Communist forces' fierce attacks lasted for four days and nights, resulting in heavy casualties. The battlefields shifted backward on the morning of the 29th, and the situation tended to improve. The National forces are currently preparing to counterattack. In addition, a regiment of Communist forces fiercely attacked Qicun, west of Baoding city, at 11:00 PM last night, but they have now been repelled. In addition, the damage to the Pingbao Road is severe, and it will take time to repair. The military is preparing to drive cars first after the road is open.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 29th] It is reported that the Communist forces in northern Shandong Province were transferred to Hebei Province. The National forces in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway and Shijiazhuang launched an attack to the southeast yesterday, annihilating two regiments of the Communist forces and inflicting heavy casualties.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 29th] Officials stated: A strong corps of the National forces advancing south along the Pinghan Railway relieved Dingxing Garden yesterday afternoon. On the morning of the 29th, the vanguard troops crossed Beihe Shop, and a portion of the Communist forces between Xushui and Caohe were shifting westward. In addition, the Communist forces' invasion of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway has resulted in nearly 10,000 casualties to date, and their attacking strength has been exhausted. It is also reported that Yixian and Mancheng were automatically abandoned by the National forces, while Rongcheng and Xincheng are being firmly defended.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th] The fighting in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway is still fierce. The National forces have begun to advance northward from Baoding, towards Xushui and Caohe. The Communist forces discovered east of Zhuozhou have been attacked by the National forces and are now fleeing eastward in disarray. The military believes that the actions of the Communist forces in the Pingbao section cannot alleviate the threat of the National forces on the Jinpu Railway to the Communist forces. At the same time, a strong force of the National forces is successively advancing south along the Pingbao Railway, echoing the National forces advancing north from Baoding, forming an encirclement. The lost strongholds will definitely be recovered.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 29th] Military news: The Communist forces in Rongcheng are launching fierce attacks day and night with two brigades. The National forces are calmly responding to the attacks, and the Communist forces have not succeeded so far, suffering heavy casualties. The city walls are still being firmly defended by the National forces. The previous reports that the National forces had withdrawn and that the situation was unclear are completely inaccurate.

### Hebei Provincial Government Establishes Office in Beiping

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Amidst the tense situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, Beiping has once again become the political center of Hebei Province. After the outbreak of the war in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, the Hebei Provincial Government found that traffic to and from the provincial capital of Baoding was temporarily interrupted. Therefore, it has established a Beiping office in Beiping to continue to promote provincial administration. The office is headed by Sun Zhenbang, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. It began operating yesterday at the old site of the Commander's Headquarters in Tieshizi Hutong, Beiping, and has telegraphed the county governments, instructing them to send official documents to Beiping for submission to Chairman Sun for review. In addition, following the refugees from eastern Hebei fleeing to Beiping, the people of Mosui and Yixian in western Hebei have also fled to Beiping due to the withdrawal of the National forces. The number of people arriving at Lian'guang'anmen yesterday reached several hundred. The Hebei Provincial Government is seeking relief.

### Yong Sheng Warship Detains Two Suspected Motorboats in the Waters of Qinhuangdao; Large Numbers of Soviet Ships Transport Goods to Supply the Communist Forces

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 28th] The Yong Sheng warship patrolled north a few days ago and discovered two motorboats driven by Koreans in the waters of Qinhuangdao. One, named Dajimaru, is a 70-ton diesel oil cargo boat, with the boat owner Tian Rongqing and nine others. According to their confession: they intended to sail the boat to Qingdao for sale. One boat, named Rouhui, is a 14-ton fishing boat, with the boat owner Li Zhonglun and eight others. According to their confession: Due to mechanical problems, they drifted here with the wind. However, after inspection, the boat's machinery was in good condition. Our navy suspected that the two boats had special suspicious traces. At 2:00 PM on the 27th, they were escorted to Qingdao and handed over to the garrison headquarters for investigation. [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Related sources report: (1) The Soviet ship "Kurasin" sailed from Dalian to Yantai on June 2 to unload 360 tons of goods, including materials shipped by the Soviet Foreign Trade Department. After returning, the ship loaded another 2,450 tons of goods to supply the Communist forces.

### Major Battles Still Underway in Mountainous Areas of Shandong Province; National Forces Reach Suburbs of Yishui; Wang Yaowu Flies to Weixian to Inspect Defense

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 29th] Yanzhou, 29th: Major battles in the Yimeng Mountain area continue unabated. The National forces have made new progress. The National forces advancing from Laiwu, Xintai, and the Zhangzhuang and Taoyu areas to the east recovered many important villages and towns, including Nanma, a strategic stronghold of the Communist forces 60 kilometers northwest of Yishui, on the evening of the 28th, defeating three regiments of the Communist forces.

It is also reported that the scope of the policy is extremely broad, including political, economic, and military issues.

### Wu Zhihui Discusses the Wanted Order for Mao Zedong; Why Political Parties Need to Resort to Arms; Arresting Rebels is the Duty of the Court

[Our Own Dispatch] Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office issued a nationwide circular to all high courts, strictly ordering the arrest of Mao Zedong. Our reporter believes this is a clear indication that the judicial organs are independently exercising their powers based on criminal law against internal rebellion. It will have a significant impact on the National Government's handling of the CCP issue. Furthermore, there will be an important meeting in the capital today to discuss national plans. It is widely rumored that the National Government may issue a punitive order against the CCP's rebellion. We have specially interviewed various parties to inquire about their thoughts on this matter. The following is a brief record of the conversations:

Wu Zhihui stated: Mao Zedong and Zhu De are leading troops in rebellion, violating criminal law. The court's order for their arrest is within its duty. It is also normal for the government to issue a punitive order. Using force against those who endanger the nation is the government's obligation and not an internal war or factional dispute as some claim. If the Communist Party is just a political party, why does it need to resort to arms? Some years ago, Soviet Marshal Stalin and Trotsky were in the same party. Stalin, to protect the country, resolutely eliminated the Trotskyites without avoiding the appearance of internal strife. This shows that protecting the country, taking unavoidable measures, is the government's duty, and there is nothing to be surprised about.

Warranting Internal and External Rebels is Common in Countries Ruled by Law

Li Shizeng Condemns Mao Zedong for Treason

Li Shizeng stated: The CCP's actions in recent years have been tyrannical, going against the trend, and are no longer those of an ordinary political party. They are practically no different from bandits in Chinese history. Furthermore, their collusion with foreign forces constitutes treason. The Chinese people must oppose such reactionaries. Even if the government issues a punitive order, it is justified. What we should pay attention to is strictly adhering to the principles of the Three People's Principles, using democratic and free politics to unite all forces to quell the CCP bandits' rebellion, but we must not go astray and adopt another form of totalitarianism. Only the power of democratic politics can overthrow totalitarianism. Issuing warrants for internal and external rebels is common in countries ruled by law. Those abandoned by the people are naturally not tolerated by the law.

Tao Baichuan's Three Opinions on the Supreme Court's Measures

Tao Baichuan (Shanghai City Councilor) said: Regarding the Supreme Court's arrest of Mao Zedong, I believe there are three points to note: First, both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have advocated a political solution to the Kuomintang-Communist Party issue. However, since Yan'an refused Zhang Zhizhong's visit to negotiate peace, the Communist Party has decisively closed the door to a political solution. However, the National Government continues to declare that it is always ready for peace talks, without changing its original intention due to the deterioration of the Communist Party's attitude. Does this arrest of Mao Zedong mean that a peaceful and political solution is no longer possible? Is it about to issue an order to punish the Communist Party? Will the military actions become more active? Is the reason that the Communist Party problem is no longer a simple internal disturbance but has degenerated into a foreign enemy? This point deserves attention. Second, some people in the central government have long believed that military actions against the Communist Party are a full-scale war. This means that combat should not be limited to the front lines or military affairs but must mobilize the strength of the rear, that is, the political, economic, and cultural forces, to be effective. Does the arrest of Mao Zedong mean the same as punishing the Communist Party, and will the political, economic, and cultural aspects implement a wartime system to cooperate with the military? This is also a major issue. Third, since the amendment of the Emergency Law on Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the Communist Party is no longer considered a criminal group in law, and joining the Communist Party is not a criminal act. Now that the leader of the Communist Party, Mao Zedong, is being arrested, will the status of the Communist Party also change according to political and legal interpretations, and will Communist Party members become the subject of crimes? The National Government may soon make a clear statement.

Policy Should Implement Constitutionalism as Soon as Possible; No One Can Violate the Law

Lawyer Ma Junshuo expressed his opinion on this issue, stating: For the sake of the country and the people, the government should implement constitutional government as soon as possible, but it must first strictly enforce the rule of law. Strictly enforcing the rule of law means that all levels of the country should act within the legal framework. Anyone who exceeds the scope of the law's regulations, people, regions, and parties is illegal. No party or individual should use force as a tool for political competition. In short, everyone in the country should respect laws and regulations to achieve peaceful unification of the country, and strengthen national defense internationally to maintain its status as one of the five major powers.

The Evolution of the Current Situation Has Become More Complex

Wu Yun Chu (Chairman of the Industrial Cooperation Association) stated: This move will not have a significant impact on the actual situation because both sides have been in a state of war for a long time. On the other hand, this move indicates that the path to reconciliation has been cut off, and the government may further order a punitive expedition. With the evolution of the current situation, the situation has become more complicated due to the existence of international factors. [Our reporter in Nanjing, 29th dispatch] The reporter recently visited Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party to ask for his opinion on the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office's circular to the chief prosecutors of all high courts nationwide, strictly ordering the arrest of Mao Zedong. Jiang said: This may be a substitute for the punitive order against the Communist Party.

### Communist Troops Recklessly Destroy and Damage; Losses to Industry and Mining in the Northeast; Spokesman of the Resources Commission Bitterly Narrates Recent Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] Since the recent intensification of the war situation in the Northeast, heavy industrial factories and mines have become the targets of deliberate destruction by the Communist troops. As of now, the situation of the factories and mines that have fallen into enemy hands, as well as the government's response measures to the entire Northeast industrial and mining industry, are matters of concern to the people. Yesterday, we interviewed the spokesperson of the Resources Commission on these issues. According to him, although the Northeast industrial and mining industry has suffered repeated destruction, it has been vigorously supported and managed by the Resources Commission for the past year, and it has already achieved some scale. This time, the Communist troops are running rampant everywhere, and the factories and mines have suffered the most, which is very sad. Dealing with the aftermath is also very difficult. In terms of the three major industrial and mining industries in the Northeast, namely electricity, steel, and coal, the power lines from Xiaofengman have been destroyed, and most factories and mines cannot operate because there is no electricity supply. Although production has stopped and income has decreased, expenses cannot be reduced. Not only do the employees of the closed factories and mines need to be maintained, but the long-term workers of Xiaofengman itself must also continue to be supported. In terms of steel, Anshan Steel Company was once in danger due to the tight situation in Haicheng, and production was greatly affected. The 5,000 tons of pig iron shipped by the company to Yingkou were delayed due to the Northeast Economic Commission's slow issuance of export licenses. Moreover, due to the chaotic situation in Yingkou, it has not been shipped out until now, resulting in huge losses. In terms of coal mines, the destruction has been particularly severe. The coal mines that have been captured by the Communist troops, such as the Xi'an Coal Mine in Liaobei, have lost all their coal, equipment, and food. Employees who fled in a hurry need to be resettled and provided with relief. Those that were once captured and have now been recovered include the Benxi Coal and Iron Mine in Liaoning Province, the Beipiao Coal Mine in Rehe Province, and the Yingcheng Coal Mine in Jilin Province. All the equipment on the site has been destroyed by the Communist troops, and the equipment and food have been moved away. After the recovery, work should be resumed as soon as possible, but the equipment is gone, and the facilities are incomplete. There is no ability to replenish them for a while. Those close to the front lines of the war zone, such as the Fushun and Yantai mines, although not yet captured, have had many workers conscripted to assist the garrison in constructing defensive fortifications, and essential mining equipment has also been requisitioned. Production work is on the verge of stagnation. Even if they can be preserved, a large amount of investment is needed to continue production. In short, whether the factories and mines have been captured or not, the government must allocate considerable funds to deal with the aftermath, to comfort and gather the refugees, to replenish equipment, to plan for resuming work, and to maintain the lives of employees. The Resources Commission, recognizing the seriousness of the matter, has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the current measures, the commission has ordered all units in the Northeast to strictly adhere to their posts and not leave lightly unless absolutely necessary. At the same time, they must try their best to preserve factory and mining equipment.

### East Asia Association Established Yesterday; Peng Xuepei Explains Organization Process and Tasks, Elects Directors, Supervisors, and Responsible Persons of the Calling Committee

[Our Own Dispatch] The inaugural meeting of the East Asia Association was held at 9:50 AM yesterday at 1177 Liyang Road (Dickson Road) in this city. Attendees included He Yaozu, Peng Xuepei, Lei Zhen, Fang Zhi, Xu Jiyun, Shao Yulin, Xu Yiqiao, and more than 70 others. Deputy Director Li Jianhua of the Social Affairs Bureau attended to provide guidance under the department's mandate.

Interim Chairman's Address: Peng Xuepei served as the interim chairman and delivered an impromptu speech stating: "The current composition of the East Asia Association is the East Asia Research Association of the former Central Propaganda Department and the Reform Society led by General Tang Enbo. The former devoted itself to propaganda against the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War and made contributions. After the victory, the nature of the task changed. The central government believed that the work of linking the emotions between various ethnic groups should be undertaken by civil organizations. Therefore, it decided to reorganize, and the Reform Society was willing to cooperate, resulting in the organization of the East Asia Association. Our country and the various ethnic groups in East Asia have had relations for about ten centuries. Today, all countries have brilliant achievements. Even new countries such as the Republic of Indonesia, its talents are evident in the Pan-Asian Conference. Our country must have an understanding and connection with these neighbors. The way to start is to assist East Asians in China to enhance friendship between ethnic groups and conduct in-depth research. The study of the Japanese question is the most important. In the current situation, Japan will inevitably revive. The East Asia Association should study our country's correct policy towards Japan for the government to adopt and supervise its implementation." Peng emphasized two points: "(1) The East Asia Association is not aggressive and does not demand that China lead the countries of East Asia, as past Japanese research groups did; (2) The association is not exclusive, advocating international cooperation instead of 'Asia for Asians.'"

Revised and Passed the Constitution: Then, He Yaozu, a member of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the preparatory process over the past two months. He also stated that the association will devote itself to solving the Japanese question, urging the Japanese people to awaken and no longer dream of imperialism.

After He's report, the chairman invited Li Jianye to give a speech for guidance. Li pointed out the central government's emphasis on the association's work and praised the association's pursuit of the ideal of international cooperation, which is different from Japan's pan-Asianism. He wished the association success. Later, Fang Zhi, chairman of the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Zhaorong, representative of the municipal government, successively gave speeches. Afterward, the chairman specially invited Lei Zhen, who had rushed from Beijing to attend the meeting, to give a speech. He briefly stated: The association should promote China's Confucian culture to the countries of East Asia. The advantage of Confucian culture is its peaceful nature, which can eliminate international warfare. Lei expressed deep vigilance about Japan's resurgence, saying that he hoped that China and Japan would no longer be enemies in the future. As long as the Japanese abandon their aggressive ideas, we should fully recognize Japan's strengths and obtain assistance from its talents and resources. After Lei's speech, the constitution was discussed. The draft constitution was revised and passed, with only two points changed: The association's work will add "(1) exchange of students and professors"; (2) Establish branches in important cities in East Asia instead of offices. Then, elections were held to produce directors and supervisors. A meeting of directors and supervisors was held in the afternoon to appoint persons responsible for each section. The list of directors, supervisors, and others is recorded below:

### Storing Grain for Famine Prevention: The Ministry of Food Prepares Measures

[Our Own Dispatch, Nanjing, 29th] The Ministry of Food has recently prepared concrete measures regarding grain storage and has submitted them to the Executive Yuan. The measures propose to establish grain storage warehouses in counties, townships, and towns across the country to prevent famine years. The measures consist of more than 200 articles, detailing the methods of collecting, building warehouses, etc. The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold a subcommittee review on the 30th, and then submit it to the Political Affairs Conference for discussion. The subcommittee will be convened by Jiang Yuntian, and the ministers of the interior, social affairs, food, agriculture and forestry, and Lei Zhen will participate. Jiang told reporters on the evening of the 29th that he believed it would not be easy to implement grain storage at a time when local order was not yet fully stable. If the management of warehouses is not proper, abuses will inevitably arise.

### Taiwan Provincial Assembly Passes Measures to Purchase Grain with Tax; Submits Request to Central Government to Implement Popular Election of County and City Mayors in Advance

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 29th] After two days of intense debate, the Taiwan Provincial Assembly finally passed the "Measures for Purchasing Grain with Tax and Purchasing Surplus Grain from Large Households" proposed by the Taiwan Provincial Government. Taiwan Province was originally a rice-producing area, but the rice shortage in the past two years has been caused entirely by grain merchants and hoarders. Chairman Wei Daoming believes that to stabilize society, the government must control a large amount of food. If grain prices rise, it will immediately carry out price stabilization. According to the measures for purchasing grain, which were originally passed by the Provincial Government's regular meeting and now approved by the Provincial Assembly, the part on purchasing grain with tax stipulates that 12 kilograms of rice will be purchased for every yuan of land tax (i.e., principal tax). The part on purchasing surplus grain from large households stipulates that those who pay more than 1,000 kilograms of rice in land tax will have their surplus grain purchased at a progressive rate, with 40% for those with less and 60% for those with more, while those who pay less than 1,000 kilograms of rice in land tax will be exempt from purchase. During the debate on this case, the Provincial Assembly did not oppose the policy of purchasing grain in principle. However, some assembly members believed that the price of NT$27.5 per kilogram of rice was too low, and after intense debate, the original plan was finally passed by a majority. In terms of this case, the majority of people in the province expressed their approval, while those who opposed it were only a small number of large landowners. According to statistics from the Food Bureau, there are a total of 7,252 large landowners in the province.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 29th] The Taiwan Provincial Assembly unanimously passed a resolution to request the Central Government to allow Taiwan Province to implement the popular election of county and city mayors in advance. According to the announcement No. 135, Item 1, issued by Minister Bai Chongxi during his visit to Taiwan, the Taiwan Provincial Assembly will formulate and submit the methods and dates for the early popular election of county and city mayors in Taiwan to the Ministry of the Interior for approval and implementation. The Taiwan Provincial Assembly believes that Taiwan Province has: (1) a clear population survey, (2) completed land surveys, (3) properly handled security, (4) completed road construction, (5) universal education, (6) people trained in national militia, and (7) people able to exercise four rights. The above items are consistent with the conditions required for the popular election of county and city mayors in the National Construction Program.

### The Yellow River Dike Has Been in Disrepair for Ten Years; This Year's Danger Is Worrying

Chen Chongling Discusses Yellow River Management Work

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th] Chen Chongling, Director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Engineering Bureau, told reporters: "The danger of the Yellow River today is a hundred times greater than in the past. In the past, repairs were carried out every year, and there were still accidents every year. Now, it has been in disrepair for ten years, and the old dikes and dams have been completely damaged. In addition, the Communist Party's obstruction has prevented the completion of the dike restoration work. Therefore, there will be major dangerous works during this year's flood season. The reconstruction work in the old flooded areas is only at the beginning, and new flooded areas may follow. Therefore, we must do our best to prevent it. We hope that the people will cooperate and assist in the promotion of the work of the Yellow River management agencies. We also hope that the whole country will focus its attention to prevent the serious disasters of the Yellow River in the future."

Editorial

### The Wanted Communist Leader

The Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office yesterday ordered the chief prosecutors of all higher courts in the country to strictly arrest Mao Zedong, stating that the Chief Prosecutor of the Gansu Higher Court reported that the Speaker of the Cheng County Council, Zuo Zhuzhu, and others reported that Mao Zedong was inciting rebellion with troops and requested legal sanctions. After investigation, the rebel Mao Zedong occupied national territory, rebelled with troops, harmed the country and the people, and committed heinous crimes. He should be arrested and brought to justice in accordance with the law in order to uphold the law and discipline. We saw this news report in the newspaper and felt a lot of emotions. Mao Zedong, as everyone in the country knows, is the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese Communist Party once participated in the War of Resistance and also participated in the Political Consultative Conference with various political parties and organizations in the country to negotiate a peaceful nation-building plan. Unexpectedly, the ink from the Political Consultative Conference was not yet dry, and the agreement on reorganization and unified compilation not only failed to be realized, but also returned to the battlefield with soldiers and weapons. Domestic peace has not been restored. In view of the only wish of the people of the country after the war was peace, this newspaper has repeatedly appealed, hoping that the CCP will prioritize the interests of the people, disarm the party, hand over its military power to the state, and, as a general political party under a democratic politics, seek welfare for the country and the nation. Unexpectedly, the speakers spoke earnestly, but the listeners were indifferent. In recent months, the armed forces of the CCP have intensified their efforts, rebelling with troops everywhere in China, from the Northeast, North China, Northwest to other places. They have also colluded with foreign forces and are stirring up trouble everywhere, openly insulting our government. Their behavior is tantamount to treason. We have long said that the government should order a crusade against these crimes of the CCP. However, until now, the government has not made such an expression. The notice from the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office to strictly arrest Mao Zedong and bring him to justice in order to uphold the law and discipline only targets Mao Zedong and is purely a judicial issue. Although it may not be unrelated to the government's attitude towards the CCP led by Mao Zedong, in terms of the case, this wanted order only involves Mao Zedong personally and has nothing to do with the political party he leads, and is not much different from a general criminal wanted order. The Standing Committee of the Kuomintang will also hold a meeting soon, and the State Council will also meet next week. According to news reports, there will be important resolutions at the meeting. Regardless of the nature of this resolution, the wanted of Mao Zedong has caused us to have the following thoughts:

First of all, we must express our infinite admiration for the Supreme Court Chief Prosecutor's strict enforcement of the law. As we have already said above, Mao Zedong is the leader of the CCP, and although the CCP is rebelling with troops, the government has not yet issued an order to crusade, and still reserves a seat for the CCP in the State Council, waiting in vain; it is obvious that the government has not yet abandoned hope for the CCP. However, the prosecutors of the Supreme Court, based on the people's reports, reviewed the facts, and believed that Mao Zedong committed heinous crimes and should be wanted and brought to justice in order to uphold the law and discipline. This not only fully demonstrates the dignity of the judiciary, but also shows the Chief Prosecutor's loyalty to the country, which is truly admirable. We must know that the problem of the CCP is a political problem, and the solution to this problem cannot be sought in the law. However, Mao Zedong, as a Chinese citizen, rebelled with troops and violated the criminal law, and his actions should be subject to the sanctions of national law, which is undoubtedly true. The issuance of this wanted order has excited the people of the country. No matter what the government decides to do with the CCP problem, since its leader has been wanted, he must follow judicial procedures and be subject to the sanctions of national law.

In the wanted order of the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, the crimes of Mao Zedong that we see are: "Occupying national territory, rebelling with troops"; judging from these words, Mao Zedong has only committed the crime of internal disorder under Article 100 of the Criminal Law. The original article said: "Whoever intends to undermine the group, seize national territory, or use illegal methods to change the national constitution and overthrow the government, and takes action to implement it, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than seven years; the instigator shall be sentenced to life imprisonment": The heaviest penalty he should receive is life imprisonment. However, the CCP's collusion with foreign forces is a fact, and what its leader has committed is not only the crime of internal disorder, but also the crime of foreign invasion. Article 103 of the Criminal Law stipulates the crime of foreign invasion as follows: "Whoever colludes with a foreign country or its agents, intending to cause that country or another country to start a war against the Republic of China, shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment." Now that the case has been filed according to judicial procedures, and will be "brought to justice," our prosecutors, who are loyal to the country, will surely be able to charge him with the crimes he deserves and punish him with national law.

Regarding the wanted of the CCP leader, we cannot help but feel infinitely regretful. The Chinese people's hope that the CCP led by Mao Zedong can immediately lay down their weapons and restore peace cannot be said to be insincere; but the CCP has failed to accept the people's demands, and ultimately had to issue this wanted order. Emotionally speaking, this is, after all, a regrettable thing. However, collusion with foreign forces, occupation of national territory, and rebellion with troops, if this can be tolerated, where will the national law be placed? The Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, as the name suggests, is the highest procuratorial organ. The issuance of this order to maintain the dignity of the national law is sufficient to win the sympathy of the people of the country.

What we cannot fail to point out here is that the leader of the Chinese Communist Party has been wanted, but the State Council still reserves a seat for the CCP. Of course, the former is a judicial problem, while the latter is a political problem. They seem to be unable to be confused. However, if the leader is recognized as "harming the country and the people and committing heinous crimes," the party he leads will naturally also have problems. A judicial problem should be investigated according to the law, but in the political aspect, necessary measures must also be taken in response to the development of the judicial aspect for coordination. Otherwise, it is always a bit ridiculous. As for what measures should be taken, we still hope that the government authorities will consider it wisely.

### A False Alarm in Suzhou; Military Section Chief Arbitrarily Confiscates Self-Defense Force Firearms; Team Members Break Through and Start Rumors; City-Wide Shock

[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 29th] Suzhou suffered a major false alarm today, and almost all the shops in Guanqian closed. The reason is that Shen Zixing, the section chief sent by the Provincial Security Command to Suzhou some days ago, reviewed the security team and the self-defense forces of various villages. The county government then ordered more than 1,600 members of the self-defense forces of various villages to gather at the Suzhou City Stadium on the morning of the 28th to undergo inspection. On the afternoon of the 28th, the event had already taken place. County Magistrate Shen Chenglong issued a handwritten order to each team, limiting them to return to their original defenses on the 29th. Unexpectedly, the Military Section Chief acted arbitrarily because he had received a provincial order to re-train the replacement team members of the self-defense forces of various villages in order to unify command. However, due to the difficulty in gathering them, the compliance was delayed. Therefore, he wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to inspect the group to implement it. Therefore, he secretly concealed the order issued by the county magistrate to return to defense and concentrated all the self-defense forces in the stadium at about 10 am on the 29th. At the same time, he arranged security team sentries to guard the entrance and exit. Section Chief Cao publicly announced that in order to organize the public self-defense force, the self-defense forces of various villages were ordered to hand over one-third of the excellent firearms. After speaking, he immediately assigned security team personnel to forcibly confiscate them. About 300 rifles and many machine guns had already been confiscated. Then, some self-defense forces, because the firearms were prepared by the local at their own expense, were unwilling to be confiscated, so they began to agitate for a riot. The order in the stadium was in chaos. In the midst of public anger, they unanimously loaded their guns and rushed out of the gate. Fortunately, the sentries retreated upon seeing this, and the self-defense forces of various villages broke through as they wished, without causing a major disaster. The news spread, and the whole city was shocked, especially in the Guanqian area, where rumors were rampant. After the breakout, the self-defense forces of various villages sent representatives to the council, the party headquarters, the county government, and other places to petition, demanding that justice be upheld. The county governor then hurriedly returned the confiscated firearms and ordered each team to return to defense immediately, and the situation calmed down. Our newspaper reporters interviewed various relevant leaders, who all stated that although this matter did not cause a disturbance, it greatly damaged the government's prestige, and they all advocated a thorough investigation of responsibility in order to appease public anger.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Suzhou, 29th] Cao Yongxiang, the commander of the Suzhou City Defense, led a team to go to Nanjing for training, and his post was temporarily held by Peng Zhan Cun, the deputy commander of the 202nd Division.

### Ping Military Court Tries War Criminals

Mochikawa Hidekazu's Sentence Scheduled for the 5th

Kiyomizu Toyoo Already Executed by Firing Squad

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 28th] The military court here publicly tried Japanese war criminal Major General Mochikawa Hidekazu today. Since the July 7th Incident, the criminal first led the puppet security maintenance association in Tianjin, assisted in the establishment of the puppet Xinmin Academy, and organized the puppet Chinese Inter-Religious Federation. He engaged in luring General Wu Ziyu to come out of the mountain, and established the Mochikawa Agency intelligence organization within the headquarters of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army, specializing in destroying our underground organizations, arresting patriotic people and underground workers, and inflicting cruel torture.

Also, Japanese war criminal Kiyomizu Toyoo, the commander of the Tianjin 1420 Unit, was sentenced to death for using cruel torture on non-military personnel during the war, and was executed by firing squad this afternoon.

### Hong Kong Becomes a Drug Trafficking Center

More Than 8,100 Taels of Opium Seized in Half a Year

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 29th] According to authoritative sources here: The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department seized more than 8,100 taels of opium in the past six months, which is worth more than HK$810,000 at current market prices. Among them, 2,580 taels were seized last week from a Kunming-Hong Kong passenger plane at Kai Tak Airport. The Revenue Service believes that the number of opium smuggling cases has been increasing recently, so it believes that drug traffickers are using Hong Kong as one of the drug trafficking centers in the Far East. As for how many "insiders" in Hong Kong are colluding with them, it remains to be investigated.

### Soviet Union Hopes to Draft European Reconstruction Plan through the UN Economic Commission for Europe; Rumor Has It That Molotov Has Already Proposed a Suggestion; The Three-Nation Foreign Ministers' Conference Seems to Have Fallen into Serious Difficulties

[Agence France-Presse, London, 29th] Today's "Observer" reported: It is heard that the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has put forward a suggestion at the Paris meeting, expressing that the Soviet Union hopes to have the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva draft a European reconstruction plan, and requiring that the Economic Commission should base its decisions on a two-thirds majority vote. The French newspaper went on to say that the Secretary-General of the European Economic Commission, Inder, has indirectly confirmed that the Soviet Union has put forward the above-mentioned suggestion, and the Soviet Union's requirement for a two-thirds majority vote is to grant the Eastern European countries a veto power, because the Eastern European countries account for six of the 17 seats in the commission. It is heard that British Foreign Secretary Bevin advocates setting up an expert committee to draft the plan, and he would be willing to hand it over to the European Economic Commission for drafting only if it can be based on a majority vote.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The foreign ministers of the three countries, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, held their second meeting at 4:10 pm (Greenwich Mean Time) to discuss Marshall's aid-to-Europe plan, and adjourned at 6:35 pm. The third meeting is scheduled to be held on the 30th in the afternoon.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] After meeting for two and a half hours at the French Foreign Ministry today, the foreign ministers of the three powers decided to continue the meeting next Monday afternoon. Molotov smiled cheerfully when he arrived at the meeting place today, but when the Soviet delegation left the meeting place led by the British, they all looked straight ahead, and their expressions seemed preoccupied. Bevin also looked worried when he left the meeting place. It is expected that the development in this second meeting was not as satisfactory as expected. Today's meeting was originally scheduled to start at 3 pm, but it was delayed until 4 pm. Reliable sources confirmed that the one-hour delay was at Molotov's request. Molotov requested the delay until this afternoon at yesterday's meeting so that he could have enough time to ask Moscow for instructions and prepare for today's meeting. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry today denied the American news agency's claim that Bidault had a secret meeting with Bevin this morning. A spokesman for the British delegation solemnly stated that Bevin only met Bidault when the meeting started today. Bevin simply took a car to the suburbs this morning. In the state of strict confidentiality of the meeting, observers here speculated whether Moscow, after receiving Molotov's first report, has decided to preside over Marshall's European plan together with Britain and France. Since today, the Paris press has been rife with rumors that the three-power meeting has fallen into serious difficulties, but responsible officials have expressed disbelief in these rumors. Moscow Radio broadcast a telegram from the Soviet official news agency yesterday, which was highly valued by people here, and believed that it might be the path that Molotov intends to take regarding the Marshall Plan. The telegram suggested that in order to clarify the meaning of the Marshall Plan, the foreign ministers of the three countries should ask the US government to clarify the scope of US assistance that European governments can expect to receive, how much money the US is prepared to allocate for aid to Europe, what conditions it intends to attach when granting loans, and whether congressional approval for aid to Europe is certain. If Molotov really suggests asking the US to ask these questions, there will inevitably be a conflict between the US and the Soviet Union regarding aid to Europe. Marshall has previously made it clear that before the US government applies to Congress for approval of the aid-to-Europe plan, it must first submit a balanced budget table of European needs and capabilities. In addition, there are procedural questions regarding the relationship between the Marshall Plan and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. For the sake of speed, Britain and France only want the commission to become an advisory body on the Marshall Plan and a transmitting body for transmitting the resolutions of European countries to the US government. However, Mittel, the secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, who recently met with Molotov in Moscow, strongly advocated that the commission become the designing body of the Marshall Plan. It is not yet known what the Soviet Union's attitude is. The British delegation hopes that Molotov can accept Britain's opinion, that is, to allow the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to participate in the design after reaching an appropriate time. At the same time, in order to speed up this design work, a special committee should be established by Britain, the Soviet Union, and France as convening countries.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Bidault is expected to protest to the British and Soviet Foreign Ministers today about the leaking of news from the Paris talks.

### Soviet Official News Agency Reveals that the Soviet Union Suspects the Marshall Plan; Says That the British and French Proposals Endanger the Soviet Union's Own Economy

[United Press, London, 29th] After the Paris three-nation foreign ministers' conference set up a "velvet curtain" at the request of British Foreign Secretary Bevin, the Soviet TASS news agency revealed a glimpse of the truth of the conference for the first time today. It is said that the procedures proposed by Britain and France endanger the Soviet Union's own five-year plan and various similar economic plans, so the Soviet Union has made the conference run aground. The British and French proposals expect a kind of "all-encompassing economic plan for European countries," but the Soviet Union feels that "the internal economic affairs of each independent and autonomous nation should be resolved by itself." The Soviet delegation expressed "serious suspicions" about the part related to the Marshall Plan. After French newspapers revealed the details of the French proposal on the 27th, the Soviet delegation was given the opportunity to clarify its views. The Soviet Union's position is that "the work of the conference should be limited to obtaining appropriate estimates from the countries concerned and compiling and reviewing them in order to determine the needs of European countries for US economic assistance."

### Molotov Hopes for Success of Foreign Ministers' Conference

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in his address at a dinner hosted by French Foreign Minister Bidault last night at the French Foreign Ministry, stated that there is reason to be hopeful for the success of the current three-power foreign ministers' conference. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also appears not to be genuinely pessimistic about the conference. These statements by the two foreign ministers have proven the rumors of difficulties encountered by the conference to be untrue. After expressing his hope for progress at the conference, Molotov stated that the three foreign ministers all have the intention to overcome various difficulties, so such hopes are well-founded. "We also remember the sacrifices we made during the war, and these sacrifices require us to strive for peace." French Foreign Minister Bidault did not seem as optimistic as the other two foreign ministers. In his welcoming speech, after apologizing for the inadequate hospitality, he pointed out the difficulties facing the current conference, but also expressed hope that the conference would have positive results.

### Austria, Norway, etc. Plan to Participate in European Recovery

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] It is learned that the Austrian government has instructed its ambassadors in Paris, London, Washington, and Moscow to inform the four governments that Austria is closely following the Marshall Plan and is prepared to fully cooperate in its implementation. Yugoslav Ambassador to France, Lisec, also informed the French Foreign Ministry today that Yugoslavia is interested in the three-power talks in Paris and that the Yugoslav government is prepared to participate in the preliminary discussions of the Marshall Plan.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] According to Swiss officials here on the 28th, the Swiss government has notified the United States and other relevant European countries that it welcomes the European recovery plan, so that all countries can contribute to it, but on the condition that it is not subject to political restrictions. If Switzerland is invited, it will participate in cooperation based on this principle.

### US Senators Urge Drafting of Bipartisan Aid to Europe Plan

### Bidault Hosts Banquet for Foreign Ministers' Conference Delegates

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] French Foreign Minister Bidault hosted a banquet at the Foreign Ministry today for important delegates to the Paris Three-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference. Those present included British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, US Ambassador to France Caffery, French Prime Minister Ramadier, and many important French figures and ministers. Before the toast, Foreign Minister Bidault apologized for the lack of abundance of the dishes and the poor quality of the bread, but expressed his pleasure at the gathering of friends.

This matter has been repeatedly discussed with the Soviet Union by the British, but without success.

### US Government Intervenes, Indonesian-Dutch Relations Turn to Ease, Both Sides to Negotiate Formation of Provisional Government

[Our Report] San Francisco, 29th Broadcast: Since the United States issued a note urging the immediate organization of a provisional government, the situation in Indonesia has eased. Reliable Indonesian sources say that the war in the East Indies has been averted due to the US note. The meaning of the US note is that unless the Dutch government compromises with Indonesia, the Netherlands and Indonesia will not be able to obtain loans from the United States. Indonesian delegation secretary-general Bottega has gone to Jogjakarta at the request of Dutch Governor-General Van Mook to meet with Sukarno. It is said that he will ask Sukarno to provide a written guarantee that Indonesia is willing to accept Dutch sovereignty and decision-making power in the provisional government. Sources said that Bottega has made a verbal guarantee to Van Mook. [Our Report] San Francisco, 29th Broadcast: Former Indonesian Prime Minister Shahrir told reporters that he would refuse to resume his post until his request for a fully authorized guarantee was agreed to.

[Reuters, London, 28th] The United States, at a time when the crisis between Indonesia and the Netherlands has reached its most critical stage, has asked the Republic of Indonesia to immediately establish a provisional federal government representing the entire former Dutch East Indies, and has offered financial assistance. According to reports from Washington, the State Department said that the US government has asked the Republic of Indonesia to cooperate in order to immediately establish a provisional federal government, and promised to provide financial assistance after the government is established. The government of the Republic of Indonesia applied for a loan of $100 million from the United States about two years ago for reconstruction purposes. State Department officials declined to say whether the aid promised by the United States was for this purpose. The State Department's note was delivered by US Consul General to Batavia, Foote, to the authorities of the Republic of Indonesia and forwarded to President Sukarno, who is now in Jogjakarta. The note expressed concern over the delay in the establishment of a provisional federal government and made it clear that the US Export-Import Bank did not intend to consider loans until an agreement was reached to establish such a government. A copy of the note has also been sent to the Netherlands. At the same time, according to reports from Batavia, reliable Dutch sources there believe that the Dutch government will not resume negotiations with Indonesia on independence based on President Sukarno's reply. Observers believe that the crisis between Indonesia and the Netherlands has thus entered its most critical stage. At the same time, the Executive Committee of the Republican Parliament has approved President Sukarno's succession to government power. Some Republican figures believe that if the resigned Prime Minister Shahrir cannot reorganize the cabinet, then the Nationalist Party, the Islamic Party, and the Left Wing Party will form a coalition government.

War Can Be Avoided, Dutch Relieved

[United Press, Batavia, 29th] After the US State Department finally sent a "memorandum" urgently requesting the government of the Republic of Indonesia to cooperate with the Dutch authorities to establish a provisional federal government, Dutch and Indonesian officials today expressed relief. Although both sides did not immediately comment on the US statement, the Dutch appeared relieved that the move had eliminated the need to decide to begin military action. Government officials in Batavia expected the arrest of Dutch troops in the next two days, now they are relieved and smiling. In Yogyakarta, Prime Minister Shahrir is expected to announce today whether he will resume his post, as the US statement supported his claims for concessions to the Netherlands. Left-wing leader Giri may acknowledge Shahrir's right to sign an agreement with the Dutch in future negotiations, which is the condition Shahrir insisted on before considering resuming his post. According to informed sources, US Consul Foote has asked Indonesian leaders to immediately respond to the United States to clarify the current stalemate. Representatives of both the Dutch and Indonesian sides will meet today at the private residence of Dutch Governor Van Mook to discuss the impact of the US statement.

I Ask You to Pay Attention to the Interests of Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 28th] Our Consul General in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, is busy contacting representatives of various responsible authorities to learn about the latest developments in the serious political situation. Chiang met with Chairman Schemerhorn of the Dutch High Commission today to discuss the rumored "scorched earth resistance" by the Republic of Indonesia, and warned President Sukarno of the Republic of Indonesia by telegram. Chiang pointed out that in addition to the moral issues involved, it is a complete violation of international law for a revolutionary country to "burn" the property of friendly foreign nationals for the sake of revolution. If the Republic of Indonesia insists on adopting such a policy against overseas Chinese, it will inevitably suffer the consequences.

### Egypt to Ask Security Council to Intervene in Anglo-Egyptian Dispute

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 28th] The Egyptian government has sent its note requesting the United Nations Security Council to intervene in the Anglo-Egyptian dispute to its ambassador to the United States, instructing him to submit it to the Secretary-General of the United Nations as soon as he receives instructions, most likely on July 3. According to responsible sources, Egypt will demand: (1) the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and Sudan; (2) the abolition of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the 1899 Anglo-Egyptian Agreement regarding Sudan.

### American Newspapers Unanimously Protest News Blockade of Paris Conference; US Officials Silent on Marshall Plan

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] American newspapers are unanimously protesting the news blockade of the Paris Three-Power Conference. Some reporters believe that Bevin is responsible for the blockade, while others believe that Molotov is responsible. Walter, a reporter for the "Baltimore Sun," directly criticized Bevin, accusing him of using the US delegation's failure to participate to abandon open diplomacy and restore secret diplomacy.

However, in fact, there is a state of news blockade in the United States regarding Marshall's proposal to aid Europe. Since the Three-Power Conference during the war, there has never been a greater lack of definite information and a greater variety of external speculations than this time. Marshall and State Department officials have repeatedly asked reporters at press conferences not to ask questions about the European aid plan. President Truman, when asked about this, only quoted Secretary Marshall's remarks at Harvard University, refusing to elaborate. US Treasury Secretary Snyder, seeing the external speculations and wanting to correct them, unexpectedly caused a surprising backlash, even leading some people to believe that the US government was divided over the aid to Europe issue. US officials, aware of the backlash caused by Snyder's remarks, have become even more taciturn than before. An official told reporters in a private capacity today that there are only two points that can be stated regarding the Marshall Plan: first, it is a European plan, not a Marshall Plan; second, there is no plan at all at present. In other words, the State Department has not yet formulated a European recovery plan, and no specific decision has been made regarding the form of aid. Another reason for maintaining silence is to avoid premature vigilance and criticism from Congress, as Republican isolationists in Congress, stubborn Democratic members of Southern states with economic minds, and anti-communist and anti-Soviet figures in both parties, if united, will block any aid plan.

### Eisenhower Appeals to Senate Committee, Asks for Increase in US Military Spending, Says US Military Strength is Inferior to Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 28th] US Army Chief of Staff General Eisenhower testified before the Senate Finance Subcommittee today, requesting an increase in the Army Department's budget. He said that the US Army, Navy, and Air Force are now second only to the Soviet Union in the world. Although the Army Department does not believe that war is likely to break out within twelve months, it is not impossible. The House of Representatives' reduction of the military budget by $478 million constitutes a major crisis for national security at the moment and should be reversed. The funds we are requesting will be used to develop aircraft manufacturing, as the Air Force is the first line of defense for the United States.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower stated today that he is willing to retain his military position after taking office as President of Columbia University and work for national security. After reaching an understanding with President Truman and the university's board of trustees, he will be available to be called to the capital at any time for consultation.

Northwest Frontier Province Demands Independence

[Reuters, Peshawar, 28th] Ghaffar Khan, leader of the Northwest Frontier Province Congress Party, known as the Frontier Gandhi, said today, "We have decided to establish an independent Pakhtunistan, with the Pashtun people exercising self-government." He also said that the British intend to make the Northwest Frontier Province a military base to resist the Soviet Union, and that the purpose of Marshal Montgomery's visit to India and meeting with Jinnah was for this.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 28th] Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim League, told reporters today that the Congress Party, having fully accepted Governor-General Mountbatten's plan to divide India, is now boycotting the referendum in the Northwest Frontier Province. He also said that the future constitution of Pakistan will grant self-government to the Northwest Frontier Province, placing it on an equal footing with the provinces of Bengal, Sindh, and Punjab. The Northwest Frontier Province's failure to participate in the Pakistan Constituent Assembly will have unfortunate consequences.

### Bose's Huge Assets May Still Be in Taiwan

### New Type of Atomic Bomb Can Destroy Major Cities Worldwide

He stated that the United States now has multiple improved atomic bombs, enough to destroy every major city in the world. At the same time, new methods of spreading disease and famine have also been invented, which can eliminate any human beings who survive the atomic bomb attacks. Therefore, the US State Department must use a maximum of three years to find ways to prevent large-scale destruction.

### Rumors That US Granted Permission to Build Air Bases in Spain; US Fleet Cruises Northern Europe

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] Dolores, Secretary General of the Spanish Communist Party, said at the French Communist Party Congress in Strasbourg that General Franco has allowed the US authorities to build a large airfield in Spain, and the United States will therefore gain a bridgehead in Europe and a strategic point in the Mediterranean.

[United Press, Rosyth, Scotland, 28th] A squadron of US warships, totaling nine ships, led by the battleship "New Jersey," sailed to ports in the Scandinavian Peninsula on the 28th for practice cruises, and exchanged gun salutes with the British Home Fleet in the Firth of Forth.

### MacArthur Headquarters Releases Report on South Korean Work, Reveals Inside Story of March Coup

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] MacArthur today released a report on the Korean occupation zone for March, revealing an attempt by the Korean right wing to seize the South Korean government, which failed. It said, "On March 2, the former Provisional Korean Government in Chongqing announced itself as the legitimate government and appointed a Consultative Committee, with Syngman Rhee as chairman and Kim Koo as vice-chairman. The military authorities immediately declared this action illegal, and there was little sign of public support."

The report expressed regret over the conflict between people with different political views on Korean Independence Day on May 1, which resulted in several deaths and injuries. On March 22 and 23, an illegal general strike broke out in South Korea, supported by Korean students, and police had to maintain order around Seoul National University.

According to a United Press correspondent in Seoul, the March coup was instigated behind the scenes by Kim Koo. Kim Koo repeatedly said that he would issue a declaration stating that the Provisional Korean Government in Chongqing was the government of South Korea. Such a declaration was finally published in some newspapers in his name, but this action did not receive support and became a bubble. Some observers believe that Kim Koo attempted to gain the backing of the Korean police, presumably believing that after gaining this support, the Americans would have to recognize him. When Kim Koo took this action, Syngman Rhee was in Washington, denying involvement in the matter, but hurriedly returned to Korea. By the time he returned to Korea, the action had subsided as a result of the military government's intervention.

Both Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee opposed the trusteeship system in Korea and did not cooperate with the US-Soviet Joint Commission. Although they had a common goal of opposition, their competition for leadership will inevitably lead to division in the future. It is heard that the two have lost some support from the left wing due to their continued opposition to trusteeship, while the left wing agrees to organize a Korean Provisional Unified Government. Kim and Rhee seem to want to establish a government by Koreans first, and then discuss the unification and independence of Korea with the US and Soviet sides.

MacArthur's report also said that the people of South Korea have continued to take various steps to prepare for final self-government. The Provisional Legislative Assembly drafted a provisional constitution based on democratic principles and allowed men and women over the age of sixty to vote. Industrial conditions have improved, with coal production in February falling short of the limit, but steel production increased.

### US-Soviet Joint Committee Moves to Pyongyang to Hold Meeting

[United Press, Seoul, 28th] It is learned today that the US-Soviet Joint Committee is scheduled to begin discussions with various Korean political parties in Pyongyang, the Soviet-occupied area of northern Korea, on the 12th to establish a provisional unified government. US military commander in South Korea, Hodge, has requested the Soviet side to allow American reporters to accompany the American committee members by car tomorrow as an exchange condition for the American side allowing representatives of the Soviet TASS news agency to come here as observers. However, Soviet commander Kolotkov has not yet replied. The Committee announced that telephone communication and air mail service between Pyongyang and Seoul will be maintained during the meeting.

### Japanese Government Announces Dissolution of Ministry of Home Affairs, Implements Local Decentralization

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] The Japanese government announced on the 29th the formal dissolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the implementation of local decentralization of internal affairs in accordance with the provisions of the new constitution. National police and education affairs, which were formerly under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs, will henceforth be directly under the jurisdiction of the prefectures and counties.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th Special] The dissolution of the Ministry of Home Affairs was formally announced this afternoon. A portion of its powers will be transferred to other ministries, and the remainder will be managed by three organizations: the Autonomy Commission, the Construction Agency, and the Public Security Agency.

### Britain Strongly Protests Against Japanese Hunting Whales in the South, Believes Japan Should Not Compete with Australia

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] Regarding the fact that the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo allowed Japan to organize a second whaling fleet to go to the Antarctic Ocean for whaling, the British government has lodged a protest with the US State Department through its ambassador to the United States, Lord Inverchapel. It is learned that the wording of the British note is very strong. Before lodging the protest, the British Foreign Office studied the report of the Australian observer who participated in the first Japanese whaling fleet. According to the report, Japanese whaling ships have no equipment for preserving whale oil (whale oil is usually used in the manufacture of margarine), so the Japanese whaling fleet often piles the whale oil on the ship, using only the whale meat for domestic consumption. In principle, whale oil should be publicly sold on the world market through the International Food Organization. However, according to the US occupation authorities, Japan consumed 34% of its meat as whale meat last year, so if Japan does not whale, it will be difficult to meet the meat supply. Regarding this point, the British side said that the Japanese people are by no means meat eaters. We believe that whaling is a matter of Japan's credibility. Japan should not be allowed to compete with Australia and other Allied countries in whaling. The whaling fleets prepared by Australia and other Allied countries will produce all the by-products of whales. In addition, although the second Japanese whaling fleet is preparing to depart, MacArthur's decision has not been formally notified to the Far Eastern Commission in Washington.

### Japanese Katayama to Deliver Policy Address, Various Parties Prepare to Question

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The joint meeting of various parties in the Japanese House of Representatives on the 28th discussed the questioning procedures of various parties on Prime Minister Katayama's policy address and the economic report of Economic Stabilization Board Director Wada Hiroo.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The national management of coal mines may be a test of cooperation between the two major government parties in Japan, the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Party. At yesterday's economic meeting, all Democratic ministers strongly opposed the coal mine national management draft proposed by Economic Stabilization Board Director Wada Hiroo. They accused the bill of being overly socialist in ideology, overly bureaucratic in control, and easily undermining the growing labor-management cooperation. The Social Democratic Party still insisted on its party policy.

### AURI Announces Welcoming Foreign Investment

[United Press Tokyo, 29th] The new Japanese Minister of Finance, Auri, stated on the 29th that he hoped foreign investment would flow into Japan's major industries, such as coal mines, electricity, and transportation. "Even small private loans will benefit Japanese industry, making it easy to double production. The majority of these loans will be used to purchase foreign raw materials, which will be repaid in installments through Japanese exports." Auri also mentioned that foreign capital could be invested in Japan's tourism industry.

### Acquitted Japanese War Criminal, Jinbo Returns to Tokyo, Deeply Grateful for President Chiang's Virtue

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Philippine President Roxas had appealed to President Chiang to find a way to avoid the death penalty or imprisonment for former Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Jinbo Hisahiko. Jinbo Hisahiko had been tried as a war criminal but was acquitted by the Jinan Court and returned to Tokyo this morning. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, he risked his life to save Roxas's life. Shortly after arriving in Tokyo, he visited the Tokyo branch of the Central News Agency to express his gratitude for their cooperation. In fact, the plan for President Roxas to appeal to President Chiang was initiated by the Tokyo branch of the Central News Agency. With the cooperation of Filipino journalists in Manila, Roxas's appeal to President Chiang occurred in August of that year.

### Strange Social Phenomenon in Japan: University Students Becoming Robbers

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The general social unrest in Japan has not improved with the Socialist Party in power. Around 11 p.m. on the 14th of this month, a police officer named Kuwahara Masaharu, from Nogizaka, Tokyo, found a suspicious man. Upon inspecting his bundle, he found a hatchet. The officer questioned him, and the man gave evasive answers. The officer then took him to the station for questioning, where he eventually confessed to his crime. The man's name was Igawa Heihachiro, 28 years old, from Kyoto, a graduate of Kyoto Imperial University's Faculty of Science, and a technical lieutenant during the war. Last April, he worked as a farm laborer at the home of a wealthy farmer named Iyama Heinosuke in Kyoto Prefecture. Recently, he was dismissed due to neurasthenia. On the 4th of this month, he received 800 yen in wages and came to Tokyo. He spent all his wages in a few days and developed evil intentions. On the 11th, he bought a hatchet at a street stall in Ueno. After wandering around for several days, at 11 p.m. on the 14th, he used the hatchet to injure the head of Niwano Fukujiro, a teacher at Akasaka Fuku-machi Elementary School, in Minato Ward, in an attempt to rob him of his possessions and escape. He was discovered at Nogizaka. It is said that he had not eaten for three days from the time he bought the axe to the time he committed the crime. Crimes of this nature are not uncommon, but the fact that it was committed by a Kyoto Imperial University student makes the problem even more serious.

### Southern Government Officially Refuses Investigation Team Entry, Soviet Union Accuses British and American Representatives of Bias

[United Press, Yugoslavian Capital, 29th] The Yugoslav government officially refused the entry of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Team's sub-group on Greek border disputes.

The Yugoslav government informed them that it needed to consider whether this action was necessary and could not respond before the 28th. Today, it announced that it was not necessary. A government spokesperson also stated that the United Nations Balkan Investigation Team was biased towards the Greek government and "accepted Greek fabricated propaganda," thus "completely losing its qualification."

[United Press, Moscow, 28th] Moscow Radio stated that British and American representatives on the United Nations Balkan Committee had forced representatives from France, Belgium, and Colombia to change their decisions regarding the Greek border dispute.

Greek Announcement of Accusations

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 26th] Regarding the letter from Greek Ambassador to the United States Dendramis to the United Nations Security Council on the 26th of this month, the Greek Ministry of Propaganda must announce its contents, stating that Greece is prepared to faithfully implement the recommendations of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Team, but if these recommendations cannot be implemented, Greece hopes that the Security Council will take decisive action. The majority of representatives on the Investigation Committee believe that Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania are assisting the guerrillas within Greece and encouraging a separatist movement to merge Macedonia into the Yugoslav Federation. In summary, if the recommendations of the Investigation Committee cannot be implemented, the Security Council must intervene, otherwise new turmoil may occur in Southeastern Europe and elsewhere. In addition, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris declared that in order to ease the situation, Greece may abandon its right to demand the implementation of Article 13 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that United Nations agencies may sanction any country that violates the Charter.

### Investigation Confirms Murder by Collaborator, Lü Fugang is Prosecuted

[Our reporter] The Pseudo Agent Lü Fugang has recently been prosecuted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of being a traitor. Lü is 47 years old, from Yingcheng, Jiangsu, and lives at No. 6 Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. According to the indictment, Lü did not engage in proper work. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, he participated in the Pseudo Agent Headquarters and served as a member of the Agent Team. At 9:00 am on August 15th, the 30th year of the Republic (1941), he and other Pseudo organization accomplices, such as Wu Zhengming, went to the vicinity of the Citibank Association on Fuzhou Road to plan the assassination of Ji Kunsheng, a Chongqing economic staff member and manager of the Hecheng Bank. On the night of October 18th, the 31st year of the Republic (1942), he again led enemy military police and Pseudo agents to capture underground work comrades Xu Zhaogui, Zhu Xinyuan, and Xu Zhaogui's wife, Xiao Lanhua.

### Slightly More Pastries Exceeds 10,000 Yuan, Tax Point for Feasts Becomes a Problem Again

The tax point for feasts in the city was originally 5,000 yuan. The Wine and Cuisine Industry Association believed that it was too low and strongly urged the authorities to raise it to 20,000 yuan. After the Council passed a resolution to appropriately raise the tax point to 10,000 yuan, the Finance Bureau notified the association to comply. It is now learned that the association is now unable to apply for the previously requested tax point of 20,000 yuan due to price fluctuations. Moreover, the current tax point of 10,000 yuan is even more inappropriate. If customers come to the restaurant and order a little more pastries, it will exceed 10,000 yuan. If the pastries are treated as a feast and taxed as a feast, it is also inappropriate. It is heard that the association will again ask the authorities to raise the tax point. Work, participating in the killing of Ji Kunsheng, and arresting Xu Zhaogui, etc., it is confirmed that this matter has been investigated and verified by the Songhu Garrison Command. Moreover, according to He Cheng Bank General Affairs Director Da Yan's testimony, the defendant confessed in the police station that he was assigned to be at the entrance of the bank at the time, and if he could not hit the target at the Citibank Association, he would do it at the entrance of the bank. It is clear that the defendant has committed the aforementioned criminal acts. His actions clearly violated Article 3 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors and Collaborators and should be punished according to Article 2, Paragraph 1. In accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is filed.

### Sanbei Transport Company's Group A Will Change to Hong'an Name

[Our reporter] Both Sanbei Steamboat and Hong'an Shipping companies were founded by the late Ningbo businessman in Shanghai, Yu Qiaqing. Hong'an was founded before the Republic, and Sanbei was established in the 30's of the Republic, both with more than 30 years of history. However, after Sanbei was founded, Hong'an gradually shrunk, so few people know about Hong'an to this day except for the shipping and transportation industries. Before the war, the two companies had more than 30 ships, and branch companies were established in various ports along the Yangtze River, with their own wharves and warehouses. Their assets were strong, and they were the crown of private shipping. During the Anti-Japanese War, some ships, such as Changxing Ming, were suspended in Sichuan, and some seagoing ships could not sail upstream, so they changed to flying foreign flags. After the victory, the company returned to Shanghai to resume operations. The second son, Shunqing, and the third son, Shunwei, were in charge of the company's affairs. Later, due to differing opinions, the business was split, and Sanbei was divided into Group A and Group B, with the ships divided equally. Group A was in charge of Quan, and Group B was in charge of. Half a year has passed. Both sides purchased two seagoing ships each. Group A was named Dongshan and Nanshan. Group B was named Weinan and Weidong.

It is heard that it will be implemented from tomorrow. The facade is currently being renovated and the signs are being painted.

### Road Bureau Steel Rails Stolen; Suspects Arrested and Escorted to Shanghai Yesterday; People Near Longtan Caught with Goods and Evidence; Several People Interceded and Offered Bribes

The Road Bureau Police Department recently cracked a large-scale theft of railway steel rails. The main suspects have been arrested and were escorted to Shanghai yesterday.

The Third Police Station, a branch of the Second Section of the Jingxi Section of the Police Department stationed at Longtan Station, reported the situation to Director Wang Zhaohuai. Upon receiving the report, Wang ordered the case to be solved within a specified time. After extensive investigation, the gang that stole the steel rails was located on the morning of the fifth of this month, around 10:00 AM, hiding on a boat in a secluded area within the Xiaokou River bend, under the jurisdiction of Dahekou Town, Liuhe County, about sixty li from Longtan Station. A large number of officers were secretly dispatched, armed, to make the arrest. They arrived at the location around 2:00 PM and, together with the local Baozhang (local head) Wu Zongru, conducted a search. As expected, a civilian boat was found in a secluded location, and thirty-nine stolen steel rails were seized, along with the main suspect, Wan Yougen. Under strict interrogation, it was learned that the organization consisted of more than ten people, led by Zhang Ating.

### Over a Thousand Police Academy Students Petition in Front of the Garrison Headquarters; For a Humiliated Classmate; Not Dispersed at 3:00 AM This Morning

[Report from this newspaper] At 1:00 AM this morning, over 1,500 students, nine squads from the entire Shanghai class of the Police Academy, lined up and staged a silent sit-in protest in front of the Garrison Headquarters, claiming that their classmate Wang Baosun was humiliated by the stationed military police at the North Station last night. They requested Commander Xuan to uphold justice, take appropriate action, and punish the offending military police. According to the petitioning students, Wang Baosun, a student in the sixth squad of the Shanghai class of the Police Academy, was a graduate of the seventh class of a military academy who had endured the hardships of the War of Resistance. He had transferred to the Shanghai class of the Police Academy. Last night, around 7:00 PM, Wang, wearing military casual clothes, was seeing off his relatives at the North Station to take the 9:30 PM train to Wuxi. While in the waiting room, the stationed military police believed Wang's attire was improper and forcibly took him to the North Station military police station. According to the petitioning students who spoke to the reporter, according to the Police Academy regulations, military casual clothes are not required to bear symbols or badges. The military police rashly determined that Wang's attire was improper and even used violence against him. After Wang was taken to the military police station, no resolution was reached.

### Shanghai Has Evolved into Today's Prosperity Through Several Transformations; Xu Weinan Broadcasts "Anecdotes of Shanghai"

[Report from this newspaper] This newspaper held its thirteenth Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Xinsheng Radio Station, inviting the famous writer and deputy director of the Shanghai Gazetteer, Xu Weinan, to broadcast "Anecdotes of Shanghai." The following is a record of his speech: In the eyes of modern people, Shanghai is already one of the world's major cities. However, few people know that in the beginning, Shanghai was just a coastal fishing village. At that time, Shanghai was a land of fishing and salt, and the residents relied on fishing and salt production for a living. Shanghai has been able to become the prosperous metropolis it is today through several transformations.

Fishing Village Leaps to Become a Commercial Port

The transformation from the fishing village period to the establishment of Shanghai Town occurred in the late Song Dynasty. At this time, the number of merchant ships importing goods into Shanghai gradually increased, so Shanghai Town was established, and the Shipping Bureau was set up. The so-called Shipping Bureau was an agency specifically responsible for collecting taxes on goods from foreign merchant ships. From this phenomenon, it can be seen that Shanghai had leapt from a fishing village to a commercial port. This was the first transformation.

In the early Yuan Dynasty, Shanghai was upgraded from a town to a county, officially becoming an administrative unit of our country. There were three important reasons for the establishment of Shanghai as a county: First, Shanghai had become the starting point for sea transport, so the Wusong River and Huangpu River became places where ships gathered, and Shanghai became a place where sailors and merchants resided, thus making the market prosperous. Second, at this time, Shanghai was a place for sea rescue, and salt production was particularly prominent, making it an important salt field. Third, the planting and weaving of cotton also developed in Shanghai at this time. Therefore, Shanghai was not only a commercial port, but also established its own industry. All of these factors were enough to make Shanghai increasingly prosperous and necessitate the establishment of a county seat. This was Shanghai's second important transformation.

After the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, in the Qing Dynasty, Shanghai established the Jianghai Customs, and even more merchants from various places came to Shanghai. Shanghai began to have groups of merchants from various places living in Shanghai - guilds and public offices. The Sixteen Piles area also began to become lively. After the Opium War, Shanghai became one of the five treaty ports, and then concessions were opened. More foreigners came to Shanghai, forming Shanghai's abnormal development and dividing it into the Nanshi (Chinese City) and the concessions. Shanghai was designated as a special municipality after 1927.

A Picture of Boiling Waves in the Yuan Dynasty

Old Shanghai had three major industries: fishing, salt, and cotton. Now Shanghai's fishing industry has not developed much, and salt production has long become a thing of the past, so these two industries are not given much attention in relation to Shanghai's history. As for cotton and homespun cloth, more people still know about them, because there are still many cotton fields outside Shanghai, but homespun cloth has long been eliminated.

During the fishing village period in Shanghai, the amount of fish caught was quite large, especially yellow croaker, yellow drum, and pomfret. Now Shanghai has become a major industrial and commercial city, and large amounts of fish need to be transported in from other places. Shanghai can no longer be considered an important fishing production area, but Shanghai fishing boats still have considerable harvests every year. According to pre-war statistics, the catch of Shanghai fishing boats was more than 100,000 dan per year.

Speaking of salt production, because in the old Shanghai, the eastern coastal area had large salt fields for boiling salt, called Xiasha. During the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, salt production in this area was particularly abundant, and it was considered one of the largest salt fields under Songjiang Prefecture, and also the place where the most salt tax was collected. Salt production gradually declined in the early Qing Dynasty and has long become a thing of the past. Now there are still names such as "Sanzao Town" and "Liuzhao Town" in Pudong. The "zao" in these names refers to the stove used for boiling salt at that time. The traces of the salt fields at that time can still be seen in these place names. Chen Chun, the salt commissioner of the Xiasha salt field in the first year of Zhishun in the Yuan Dynasty, once drew a "Picture of Boiling Waves" based on the methods of boiling the sea to extract salt. From this picture, we can still see the procedures for boiling salt and the lives of the salt workers at that time.

White Doors and Red Houses, No Lazy Women

As for Shanghai's cotton production, it has been very developed since the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Cotton production occupied most of Shanghai's territory, and women in rural villages also engaged in spinning and weaving. During the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates invaded Shanghai, wantonly burning, plundering, and harassing, but they could not take away this cotton production. By the Wanli period, Shanghai's cotton textiles were popular everywhere, and even imported into the capital. Because the cotton industry was so prosperous, Shanghai became increasingly wealthy, and the lives of the residents gradually became extravagant.

Speaking of cotton fields, we must also mention Huang Daopo of the Yuan Dynasty. According to legend, Huang Daopo was from Wunijing, fifty li east of Songjiang Prefecture. She returned from Guangzhou in the Yuanzhen period of the Yuan Dynasty and taught her skills in spinning and weaving to the people of Shanghai, so she became the first person to improve Shanghai's textile tools and methods. After she taught the new methods of spinning and weaving, women in every household, regardless of wealth or poverty, were diligent in spinning and weaving, so the poems praising the Huang Daopo Temple at that time had a line saying: "White doors and red houses, no lazy women." After she died, people were very grateful for her contributions and built the Huang Daopo Temple in Wunijing. Today, due to the long years, the temple has been abandoned and the original traces can no longer be found. Huang Daopo's tomb is also gone, but the tomb site can still be vaguely identified in Wunijing.

Traces Still Remain in Nanshi

Now Shanghai's cityscape, compared with old Shanghai, has undoubtedly undergone a complete transformation and is completely different. Even in recent decades, it has changed greatly. For example, the Jianghai Customs, which stands tall on the Bund, was first built in the 26th year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, rebuilt in the 7th year of Xianfeng, and rebuilt again in the 17th year of Guangxu. The current building of the Jianghai Customs was rebuilt in 1925. Another example is Nanjing Road, where companies and shops are lined up and is the most lively street in the central district. However, during the Guangxu period, both sides were still old-fashioned Chinese buildings, and the only means of transportation were horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws. Now they are all Western-style tall buildings, and the scenery on the road is also completely different from before. In comparison, Nanshi still retains a bit of the atmosphere of old Shanghai. Take the City God Temple as an example. Although it has gone through many vicissitudes, after the victory, it has been renovated. However, except for the addition of a bronze statue of Mr. Li Pingshu in front of Huxin Pavilion and the transformation of Small World into a commercial center, it basically retains its old style. Even the original sites of those shops, tea houses, and stalls are still the same as many years ago, without much change. The City God Temple in Nanshi can be said to be a very interesting temple market. From this, we can also see the simplicity of the old Shanghai city, which contrasts with the prosperous central area, creating a different atmosphere.

[Report from this newspaper] Wu Machen, a patrolman in the Jianghai Customs from Xuzhou, 54 years old, lived in a shantytown on a small road behind Yongxing Road, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. Wu suffered from stomach disease and recently felt pain. At 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, when he returned home from work at the Customs, he bought a package of baking soda from Tianshengtang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop at the intersection of Qiujiang Road for 2,000 yuan and took it home to swallow. Who knew that less than half an hour after taking it, he suffered severe abdominal pain, and soon his face turned pale and he died. Wu Zixian believed that his father's sudden death was strange, so he reported it to the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau, accusing Wang Zhongde, a clerk at Tianshengtang Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop, of negligence.

### Middle School Teachers Request Summer Relief Funds

The Shanghai Middle School Education Research Association will issue a declaration on the summer life problems of its members and appeal to the relevant authorities. The original text is as follows: "The treatment of our middle school teachers is meager, especially the treatment of teachers in private schools, which depends on whether the tuition income is sufficient and whether the school's finances are transparent. Generally, middle school teachers teach at least 20 hours a week and as many as 30 hours or more. In this busy work, they are not well-fed or well-clothed, and they worry about oil, salt, firewood, and rice every day. How can they dedicate themselves to their work when their lives are unstable? At the beginning of this semester, some private schools had payment methods that paid once a semester or once every three months. Of course, the enlightened school authorities believed that this was preferential treatment for teachers, allowing them to receive a larger sum of money, but prices were soaring, so the money at the beginning of the semester was not enough by the middle of the semester and is now reaching the point where it cannot be maintained. What about the many schools that still pay monthly? Now there is a long vacation before the next semester begins. In today's general rise in prices, teachers with monthly income cannot maintain themselves, let alone those without income recently. How will they get through this difficult period? The colleagues of the Middle School Education Research Association have experienced the hardship of their colleagues' lives firsthand. We request: (1) That the educational administrative authorities immediately investigate teachers in need of relief at the end of this semester and provide a one-time relief fund. (2) If relief funds cannot be raised for the time being, the government can negotiate with the banking syndicate for interest-free or low-interest relief loans for teachers in need of relief. Our request is not great. If the wise authorities accept and implement it, the thousands of teachers who benefit will be extremely grateful. The government will also have a great effect on stabilizing people's livelihoods. We hereby sincerely appeal for your adoption."

Beatty's shots were very stable. He took the lead in the first set with a 4-3 score and won 6-4. Beatty cramped up in the second set, leading the audience to believe that there was no hope for him to recover. Unexpectedly, Vicksburg's shots became erratic in the third set, hitting the net and going out of bounds, and Beatty took a 2-1 set lead. Vicksburg improved significantly in the fourth set, but after Beatty won the first game, Vicksburg won six consecutive games. However, Vicksburg could not maintain his normal state in the final set and ultimately lost. Czech star Troeni won by default as Argentine Moria withdrew due to a shoulder injury. American Kramer defeated Sweden's Johnsen, but it was a difficult victory. Johnsen took a 5-4 lead in the first set and unfortunately lost both "set points." The scores were 7-5, 2-2, 6-3.

### Textile Adjustment Committee Hosts Cotton Yarn Price Negotiation; Implements Joint Distribution System; 20-Count Yarn Priced at 8.8 Million Yuan Per Piece; Yarn Merchants Can Add 5% Profit Margin Based on Factory Price

[This Newspaper News] Due to the recent rise in yarn prices, the Textile Adjustment Committee received a central government order to earnestly continue price negotiations. After repeated meetings and discussions, no concrete decision was reached. Around 5:00 PM yesterday, Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, specially invited all directors and supervisors of the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association to a tea party at his residence. Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Director Zou Bingwen of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and others also attended. After discussions lasting until around 8:00 PM, the final key points were reached: (1) Implement a joint distribution system. (2) 20-count yarn will be priced at 8.8 million yuan per piece. (3) Future cotton yarn price negotiations will be conducted in a dynamic manner. The plan will be distributed by the Textile Adjustment Committee via telegraph to the governments of Beijing and Shanghai, the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the governments of Wujin, Wuxi, and Nantong counties, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association, and the Shanghai Yarn Business Association, and will be implemented immediately upon receipt. The detailed measures are as follows:

(1) Cotton yarn prices will be reasonably negotiated at any time in a dynamic manner based on production costs and with reference to market conditions, in order to achieve the effect of stable prices. (2) This committee will supervise state-owned and private yarn factories to prepare a large amount of cotton yarn and implement joint distribution, temporarily using the China Textile News Agency to handle various procedures.

Cotton yarn of various counts and brands not listed above should generally be priced according to market custom, with reference to the fixed price. In general, the price of cotton yarn of the same count should not exceed the above agreed-upon maximum selling price.

### Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of Textile Construction Company Decides on Business Policy; Full Production Can Be Resumed Within Three Months if Coal Supply is Proper and Situation in the Northeast is Good

[This Newspaper News] The first joint meeting of the second session of directors and supervisors of the China Textile Construction Company was held in the company's conference room at 4:00 PM yesterday. All 15 directors and supervisors attended, and Chairman Chen Qitian presided over the meeting, which adjourned around 7:00 PM. Important motions are as follows:

(1) Business policy (A) Increase production: If the coal supply is normal and the situation in the Northeast is good, it is planned to restore all unstarted spindles and looms within three months.

(2) Machine parts, (3) Materials. For the above two items, domestic purchases will be prioritized if they can be produced or purchased domestically. The company's Qingdao First Chemical Plant is scheduled to start production in the middle of this month, producing caustic soda for use by the company's printing and dyeing plants. For steel wire heddles, the company needs a minimum of 1,000 sets per year, most of which will be purchased from the China Textile Machinery Company, and a small portion will be purchased from abroad.

### Jewelers' Restoration Is Hopeless; Petition Representatives Have Returned to Shanghai

Representatives of jewelers from all over the country went to Beijing to petition, requesting improvements to the regulations on the buying and selling of jewelry gold, raising the price limit, and allocating jewelry gold and raw materials. The National Economic Commission has already resolved on this matter a few days ago, maintaining the original resolution. The reason is that changing the measures for handling jewelry business stipulated in the economic emergency measures plan under the current financial turmoil will shake foreign exchange and stimulate prices. Therefore, although the national jewelry industry has petitioned several times, the result has been no gains. Wu Pengnian, Yao Guiqing, Chen Dezhang, and Fa Yunliang, four representatives from Shanghai, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. They said that the Executive Yuan proposed reducing the fineness of jewelry gold and restoring sales, but representatives of jewelers from all over the country did not accept it due to issues such as worker skills, customer mentality, and business operations. Therefore, there is no possibility of changing the jewelry sales methods in the short term. Regarding the future survival of large and small jewelers in this city, the guild will convene a board of directors and supervisors meeting this afternoon to discuss and decide.

### Manufacturing Cigarettes: Raw Materials Difficult to Acquire; Main Reason for the Decline of Local Chinese Cigarette Factories in This City

Chinese cigarette factories in this city have recently been reducing production or even cutting back on work. The reasons for this, in addition to narrow sales channels and declining business, are also mainly high costs. Among them, such as tobacco, the production areas of American tobacco leaves in China are originally in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Anhui. Since the fierce battle in Shandong and the interruption of the Jiaoji Railway, Shandong tobacco leaves have completely disappeared. Anhui tobacco leaves do not have a large output, and they are all bought up nearby by numerous small cigarette factories, and very few are transported to Shanghai. Only Xuchang in Henan remains, and the tobacco leaves produced there cannot meet the demand, and the shipping costs along the way are very high, pushing the market price higher and higher, now reaching 26,000 to 27,000 yuan per pound, which is more expensive than the best quality American tobacco. (According to the official exchange rate, the cost of importing the best American tobacco to Shanghai is only 18,000 yuan.)

Furthermore, only one-third of the import quota for cigarette paper needed for making cigarettes can be supplied. The Minfeng Paper Mill can only supply one-fifth. If cigarette paper imports cannot be increased in the future, or Minfeng's production cannot be increased, then cigarette production will be severely affected. As for tinfoil paper, it is also impossible to meet the demand due to insufficient domestic production (only one factory, Hualv Tinfoil Factory, and it has been shut down for several weeks) and import restrictions. In terms of wages, the packaging work of cigarettes still relies on manual labor, and wages are also quite high. In addition, the biggest difficulty for cigarette factories is the lack of operating funds. If they borrow from outside, the terms are short and the interest rates are high, and the factories have difficulty raising funds in terms of light economy. Under these various difficulties, the future of the cigarette industry in this city is particularly bleak.

### Estimated Cotton Yarn Exports This Year May Reach One Million Pieces

[This Newspaper News] It is reported that the authorities will use the total production of yarn and cloth by national and private yarn factories in the country last year to meet domestic needs, and export the increased production this year. According to an estimate by a textile industry authority: If this news is indeed true, then the amount of cotton yarn available for export this year will increase significantly. Based on the production volume of various counts of cotton yarn last year, state-owned factories produced approximately 460,000 pieces, and private factories produced approximately 600,000 pieces, with a total production of just over 1 million pieces. It is estimated that this year, state-owned factories can produce approximately 800,000 pieces, and private factories can produce approximately 1.2 million pieces, with an estimated total production of approximately 2 million pieces. Then the estimated amount of cotton yarn available for export can reach approximately 1 million pieces. However, this estimated production volume has not yet recovered to the pre-war production level. The pre-war production volume of cotton yarn in China could reach 2.5 to 2.6 million pieces per year.

### Current Situation of Ramie Cloth Production and Sales in Liuyang and Liling

[Changsha News] Ramie cloth, a local product of Liuyang and Liling in Hunan Province, has a long history and is renowned. Before the 20th year of the Republic, it was sold throughout the country, the Far East, and the Americas. During the Anti-Japanese War, domestic sales were quite good. After the restoration, due to the continuous dumping of foreign yarn and cloth, no one was interested in domestic ramie cloth. Ramie cloth is a rural family handicraft industry. From retting hemp to spinning and weaving, it takes as long as half a year. Therefore, the output is not large, and the cost is also high, but the price is still low compared to the price of silk, yarn, and cloth produced at home and abroad. Currently, the production volume in both areas is very small. If you collect forty or fifty pieces at a time, it is difficult to gather them. Ramie cloth types are currently divided into account ramie, printed (floral) ramie, medium bleached, medium fine, upper fine, and extra fine varieties. The market price is approximately 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per piece (five city feet).

### Hangzhou Commodity Prices Fall

[This Newspaper Hangzhou, 28th] Commodity prices in Hangzhou have generally fallen due to tight silver in the annual settlement, but people are optimistic. Yesterday they were tired and tight, so it is expected to only stabilize for four or five days.

### This Year's Production Could Reach 50,000 Piculs. Optimistic Outlook for Taiwan Tea Exports. Shou Jingwei Announces Results of Inspection Trip to Taiwan.

The sluggishness of tea exports is mainly due to the difficulty in balancing domestic and foreign markets. In addition, the lack of a unified promotion agency within the country and the inability to standardize prices abroad have led to a situation where domestic tea merchants cannot concentrate and foreign tea prices have gradually plummeted. The China Tea Industry Joint Operations Corporation, recognizing this, has decided to revitalize export methods and jointly cooperate with well-known foreign merchants. The first step is to ask Chinese and foreign tea experts to evaluate and grade the 80,000 boxes of export tea mortgaged to the Farmers Bank of China by various tea states last year. The Qimen portion has already been completed. Tunlv and Pingshui will also be completed in order. Once all are completed and the National Bank agrees to allocate funds, they will be handed over to the company to transfer to the tea merchants to redeem the mortgaged tea boxes. Then, the company will establish another agency to centralize promotion and seek unification.

Shou Jingwei, the general manager of the company, decided to apply this method to the Taiwan tea industry in order to expand business. To this end, Mr. Shou went to Taiwan on the 17th of this month to preside over the opening of the company's office in Taiwan Province, and visited various tea-producing and tea-making areas for a general inspection. He returned to Shanghai after completing his public duties last week. It is said that Taiwan Province produces oolong tea and black tea, which are famous all over the world, especially oolong, which is well-known and spread throughout Europe, America, and the Near East. Before the war, the highest production in Taiwan reached 4 million catties. The tea gardens in Taiwan expanded to 45,455 jia (each jia is equal to 14.5 mu). The manufacturing plants are large in scale and fully mechanized. According to surveys, there are 49 in Taipei, 5 in Hsinchu, 137 in Taichung, and 12 in Kaohsiung. In the past, during the Japanese occupation, tea exports were a major commodity, which not only invigorated the rural economy, but also enriched the national treasury and earned foreign exchange, making it a strong competitor to my country's tea industry. During the war, the Japanese tried to increase food production, the tea fields were barren, and the manufacturing plants were gradually destroyed. Its production is no longer what it used to be. However, it is understood that this year's total production in Taiwan can still reach 50,000 piculs. If it is not affected by typhoons in the next two weeks, the total amount may exceed this number.

It is also estimated that 10% of this can be oolong tea. Oolong is the most precious in Taiwan. According to overseas prices, the average price is 55 cents per pound in US dollars, while black tea can be sold for more than 40 cents. Mr. Shou also said: During this trip, what he felt most excited about was that the heads of various agencies and local people in Taiwan Province were able to cooperate sincerely. The most helpful factor in promoting Taiwan tea was the Taiwan Bank's approval of NT$200 million in tea loans, including purchasing, primary processing, processing, and transportation. If unified action is taken for external promotion and uniform prices are maintained in the future, the future of Taiwan tea is very optimistic.

[Another Dispatch] According to the person in charge of the Farmers Bank of China, the tea production this year is not good because the tea stored in the 35th year of the Republic of China is still mortgaged and has not been sold. The tea farmers believe that the tea stored in the 35th year of the Republic of China has no sales channel, and the new tea this year will inevitably be the same. In order to avoid losses, they are not interested in making new tea this year. In order to save the crisis of Hua tea exports, the bank will suggest that the government purchase the tea stored in the 35th year of the Republic of China at a fixed price to encourage the production of new tea. The government's fixed purchase price must give merchants a legitimate profit, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve results.

It is also said that the old tea currently being auctioned by the Central Trust of China is old tea from the 20th to the 34th years of the Republic of China. Many of them are moldy and of poor quality. In order to improve the sales channel of new tea, the bank will also suggest that all of this old tea be burned to fully promote new tea.

This Year's Tea Production is Small but of Good Quality

This year's tea production season is coming to an end, and the quality of new tea produced in various producing areas is better than in previous years. There are two reasons for this: (1) The weather in each producing area this year is very good. My country's tea industry has not yet reached the stage of mechanization. The use of manual tea production requires good weather to evaporate the eternal part of the tea leaves. (2) The Farmers Bank of China's tea loan is properly organized. Tea farmers can mortgage the tea to the Farmers Bank of China when they use the loan to make good tea, so as to avoid capital being stranded.

However, although the quality of tea produced this year is good, the output is very small. After the Farmers Bank of China thoroughly investigated the reasons, such as the increase in costs and the high cost of labor after the rise in rice prices, the Farmers Bank of China's loan was too small to support it, so it had to be suspended. Now, the Export Promotion Committee will jointly discuss with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Central Bank to strengthen the production and export of Hua tea in the Hua tea producing areas. It is reported that the Farmers Bank of China may relax the limits on processing loans to protect the legitimate profits of tea merchants and tea farmers.

### The Export Control Commission Treats Controls and Does Not Discriminate Against American Businesses

Regarding the American businessman's telegram to the State Council of his country, attacking my country's Export Control Commission for treating American businessmen harshly, and requesting the American authorities to reconsider aid to China, the spokesperson of the Export Control Commission yesterday said: American businessmen's attacks on my country's import control methods are not the first time. This American businessman's doubts are all misunderstandings. The explanation can now be divided into two points:

(1) Since the Export Control Commission was ordered to implement the import control measures, it has never favored one party and demanded from the other. In order to strictly implement import control, all parties are dissatisfied, which is not limited to foreign merchants, but also Chinese merchants are dissatisfied. The fact can prove that the Export Control Commission does not discriminate against American businessmen.

(2) The United States claims that the items approved for import by the Export Control Commission are all materials from wealthy families. This point is also just a conjecture of suspicion. Since its establishment, the Export Control Commission has never allowed wealthy families to use special relationships to import materials. The materials they import also need to be approved by the Export Control Commission and imported within the quota. There are many materials that are outside the quota and prohibited from import that are detained or not allowed to be imported by the Export Control Commission. This can be checked in the accounts, and the numbers will be made public soon so that all parties can understand the inside story. Based on the above two points, it is hoped that the doubts of American businessmen are all misunderstandings and are definitely not facts. It is also reported that the relevant parties revealed that the association has drafted a document to refute and explain the American businessmen's doubts one by one. After being approved by Zhang Jiajiao, the chairman of the association, it can be submitted to the US State Council by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Silk Weaving Industry's Yarn is Distributed Uniformly by the Association

The original yarn for the silk weaving industry was directly applied to the Textile Construction Corporation for yarn distribution. Now, in order to simplify the yarn distribution procedures, the Textile Construction Corporation ordered the silk weaving industry association to purchase and distribute it uniformly. The industry association has issued a notice to all members to register with the association for the monthly demand. The registration period ended yesterday (29th). Failure to register after the deadline will be regarded as voluntarily giving up the current yarn rights, and no supplementary procedures will be allowed.

This Year's National Cotton Field Estimates

The Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Joint Association of the Cotton Textile Industry of the Republic of China jointly announced that the cotton fields in all provinces have increased this year. There are no more than three reasons for this: (1) After eight years of resistance war, cotton farmers suffered greatly and seeds were lacking. The Cotton Production Improvement Office has a large supply of good seeds this year. (2) Financial institutions provide substantial assistance to cotton farmers, and cotton production loans (including physical objects such as fertilizers and medicines) are widely provided, so that cotton farmers do not have to worry about the lack of production costs. (3) Before the cotton planting in the spring of this year, cotton prices soared. The above three factors are all excellent conditions for increasing cotton fields.

This survey is limited to before June 1 of this year, and some counties failed to conduct on-site surveys due to special circumstances, such as Anyang and Tangyin in Henan; or the surveys were not precise due to the difficulty of work, such as Yancheng, Funing, and southern Shandong in northern Jiangsu. The cotton field figures for each province are listed below:

Province Area of cotton field (thousands of municipal mu)

Hebei 6000

Shandong 2800

Shanxi 660

Henan 4000

Shaanxi 3180

Hunan 990

Shanxi 280

Hubei 7200

Anhui 710

Jiangsu 7000

Zhejiang 1620

Sichuan 3400

Liaoning 1200

Total 39040

The weather was still good during the cotton sowing period this year. Although some areas in the Yellow River basin were slightly dry, there was generally no significant impact. In some areas of the Yangtze River basin, such as Huarong County, the temperature was slightly lower in early May, and in areas such as Taijia, from late April to early May, but it did not have a major impact on the growth of cotton.

In summary, the national cotton field this year is 39,040,000 municipal mu, an increase of 9,622,000 municipal mu compared with the 29,418,000 municipal mu announced by our association. Although there is a difference from our expectations, in the midst of war, this trend is still satisfactory. If the situation is clear, the increase in production will definitely not be limited to this.

### The Cotton Yarn Cloth Seized by the Former Economic Supervision Group is All Handled by the Textile Adjustment Committee

The former Economic Investigation Team seized a large amount of stockpiled cotton yarn and cloth in order to crack down on illegal merchants' speculation. Now that the team has announced its abolition, the seized goods that were sealed are now ordered to be handled by the Business Department of the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. According to news from relevant parties, the disposal of all the seized cotton yarn and cloth is expected to be tendered in batches in the middle of next month.

In addition, the municipal government has ordered the yarn factories and cotton industry associations to report the amount of raw cotton stored for yarn production before today in order to stop the rising cotton yarn prices. The city government is preparing to launch a thorough investigation of cotton stored in warehouses starting next month. If there is any false information, they will be dealt with according to the law.

### Unveiling the Secrets of Hollywood

— Hollywood, 16th (Airmail Dispatch) Our Correspondent Mao Shuqing

Is Hollywood mysterious? Not really. Smooth roads, orderly buildings, and it is no different from many other American cities. Year-round sunshine, palm trees spreading across the fields, and even the fervent, exciting Spanish atmosphere of Central and South America, can be seen in any town in California, and are not unique to Hollywood!

However, Hollywood is indeed mysterious. Those who have not been to Hollywood would surely imagine: Hollywood is full of movie stars, and movie stars, in any country, lead romantic and absurd lives. Before I came to the West Coast, I heard many "New Yorkers" say: Hollywood is crazy, you will be immersed in this sea of madness!

How Much Investment is a Big Key

The reality is not as crazy as the legends. During my nine-day stay in Hollywood, I felt that the atmosphere of "doing practical business" in Hollywood is much stronger than the atmosphere of "pursuing art." In a capitalist society, industry and commerce come first. I don't believe that those artistic workers in Hollywood are striving for an artistic ideal. Of course, in Hollywood, there are also people who live for artistic aspirations. For example, Mr. Geng Tingsheng, a set designer at Columbia Pictures, whom I met. Looking at his tousled hair characteristic of art personnel, and his greasy tweed suit, his conversation, his actions, and even the ideals in his mind, seemed to have been isolated, no, at least temporarily forgotten about real life. However, such people are, after all, few. The company bosses, screenwriters, directors, and actors I came into contact with in Hollywood, the moment they opened their mouths, they boasted about their wealth, or the assets they invested in the film industry. They felt that taking these words to boast to a Chinese news reporter who had come from afar would enhance their identity and status.

I am not criticizing them for not being justified. In a commercial society, capital is paramount. How good or bad a movie is, and how much is invested, is a very important key. One boss asked me: How much capital does a domestically produced Chinese film require? I said, I'm not very clear, probably at least 10,000 to 50,000 yuan. He asked again: How much is that in US dollars? I calculated that it was probably several thousand US dollars. He laughed loudly: "How can that work? Our films cost at least two million dollars, and some cost more than ten million!" A director next to him added: "Some even cost twenty million US dollars!"

This is just an example. The thousands of people in Hollywood, living in artistic circles, often recite money figures as if they were the "Bible." During my short stay in Hollywood, many people told me: The great singer Bing Crosby gets US$5,000 for singing for one hour for a record company. Hard-boiled actor Clark Gable signed a long-term ten-year contract with MGM last year, with a weekly salary of US$7,500. It is said that these two big stars are the highest-paid people in Hollywood today. The person who told me especially added a note: "Pay attention, the contract is for ten years. There is no boss in the world who would be so generous as to support a young star until they become old and decrepit!"

When I met Mr. Kennedy, a producer at Columbia Pictures, he said: "Columbia now pays the big star Dick Powell a salary of $20,000 a week." Afterwards, many people doubted this figure. They said: Gary Cooper at MGM now only makes $2,000 a week.

Global Wealth is Sent to Hollywood

Mysterious figures create the mystery of Hollywood. Now, the wealth of the world is obediently sent to Hollywood (I don't know if Soviet Russia is showing American movies). Piling up every bit of Hollywood's prosperity. Now, Hollywood has: the most "aristocratic" life in the world, villas on Beverly Hills worth fifty million dollars, hotels costing sixty-eight dollars a day, the most exquisite clothing in the world, and beautiful 1947 cars. Hollywood Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, are full of splendid restaurants, cafes, and countless nightclubs of all sizes, as well as the so-called "Chinese Theater" which is a case of "hanging a sheep's head but selling dog meat!"

Chinese Theater - Stone Lions Guard the Entrance

The Chinese Theater is on Hollywood Boulevard, with a majestic palace-like exterior, and a pair of "stone lions" transported from China standing at the entrance, along with Chinese couplets inscribed. Inside, it still shows American movies. It is said that American tourists come to Hollywood year-round, and clever theater owners use this "novelty" psychology to make money.

Methods of making money are readily available in Hollywood, and many people "rely on" the mysterious film industry. Hollywood's film industry only began to expand on a large scale after the First World War, and Hollywood's population also surged within these twenty years. After the end of this war, soldiers who had previously come from the inland, passed through Los Angeles to Hollywood to go overseas, and after returning to the United States, they brought their wives and moved to live near Los Angeles, because it was easy to make money, the weather was good, and they could broaden their horizons!

Twenty Years of Time - Barren Land Becomes Residential Area

A geographical concept urgently needs to be explained, that is, the relationship between Los Angeles and Hollywood. Not only are Chinese people confused about it, but even Americans on the East Coast are also confused. Let me give an analogy: Los Angeles is like Shanghai, and Hollywood is like Jiangwan or Hongkou. Jiangwan is a part of Shanghai, and Hollywood is also a part of Los Angeles. Thirty or forty years ago, Los Angeles was just a pitiful little seaport, and Hollywood was also desolate and bleak. Many capitalists from Chicago, New York, and Detroit, after making money, bought a barren mountain in Hollywood, built villas, and spent their twilight years there, because Hollywood had good sunshine and a good environment.

However, in the blink of an eye, the sea has turned into mulberry fields! In twenty years, Hollywood has transformed itself into the holy city of the film industry, the Jerusalem and Mecca for young men and women. Hollywood has not only blended with Los Angeles, but is also constantly expanding and developing, all the way to the seaside. Twenty years ago, the barren hills on the Pacific coast have now become the most expensive residential areas in the world. The roads, like screws, spirally twist and turn between the mountain peaks.

Due to the fear of earthquakes, Los Angeles and Hollywood do not have high-rise buildings like New York, Chicago, and Shanghai. It is an orderly, clean, and completely flat city, and it is also the city with the widest flat area in the world. Living in Los Angeles and Hollywood, if you don't have your own car, it's really a terrible thing. There are not many buses, and they run too slowly. Los Angeles and Hollywood have no subways.

During my first few days in Los Angeles, I was very worried about the transportation problem. The high prices of hotels in Hollywood scared me into having to live in the city of Los Angeles, but the twenty-mile commute was very difficult, until I found two American friends, and troubled them to drive me around every day.

"My friend" Vogel was a film director more than ten years ago. He directed the earliest "Charlie Chan" detective stories. Vogel believes that the death of the first "Charlie Chan" was a great loss to Hollywood. During the war, Vogel was a lieutenant colonel in the army and went to Italy. I met him in Rome, and he was introduced to me by Dr. Xie Shoukang, the minister to the Vatican.

Faded Beauty - Golden Age Too Short

Vogel now runs a record company, where he is the chairman and general manager. One of his colleagues, Rowland James, was also a friend from the Roman battlefield. At that time, he was a captain in charge of military broadcasting. He often boasted about his wife in Italy.

His wife, Mamo, was a female star with considerable status in Hollywood more than ten years ago, and knew many inside stories about the film industry. She often lamented to herself: "When one gets old, everything is useless!" She said: The golden age of movie stars is too short, they are all afraid of getting old, and they are also afraid of getting old! She said: Most of the stars spend lavishly during their golden age, and there are those who can accumulate money and become rich, but relatively few.

The Rowland couple drove me around the entire city of Greater Los Angeles. We started from Olive Avenue in the oldest developed part of the city, all the way to the Roosevelt Highway on the Pacific coast, passing over several hills and slopes. All along the way there were exquisite residences. The owners of these residences included movie stars, high-ranking military officers, and wealthy merchants and big buyers. Mrs. Rowland pointed out to me a row of neat residences on the back of Beverly Hills, along the Pacific coast, saying: "These are all Mary Davies' real estate." Then, she added: "You probably haven't heard of her, a red star from more than ten years ago!"

Beverly Hills Back - Movie Star "Concentration Camp"

Beverly Hills is behind Hollywood. Looking at the map, it is in the western part of Los Angeles. That is the "concentration camp" for beauties, the residential area for first-class movie stars. The day after I arrived in Los Angeles, I took a tour bus from a travel company to leisurely tour Hollywood. On the way from Hollywood to Beverly Hills, there were all kinds of "nightclubs." The tour guide said: This one? Those few, those few stars often come and go here. Many nightclubs are run by stars who have "retired and returned to their hometowns." Although they have retired from service, they still live in Hollywood, relying on the warriors of the next generation.

On Beverly Hills, I saw the residences of Tyrone Power and Loretta Young. I remember that Tyrone Power's (the pillar of 20th Century Fox) residence was opposite Gary Cooper's. There is a corner on Beverly Hills called "Musical Corner," where there is a three-way intersection, and three big singers live on the three corners: Deanna Durbin, Nelson Eddy, and Ilona Massey.

These people are all well-known figures in Hollywood. In their world, they are the darlings of fortune. All the American news reporters stationed in Hollywood track their every word and deed, and publish them in the so-called Hollywood columns of various newspapers. Hollywood people still talk with great relish about Shirley Temple's grand and majestic wedding.

Lead's Salary - $500 US Per Week

In reality, those who are truly called red stars are, comparatively speaking, very few. In the movie world, there is no standard for the income of red stars. Some have long-term contracts with companies, and some are paid on a per-film basis. I visited several companies (to be introduced in another article). I know that 20th Century Fox has about seventy or eighty people with long-term contracts with the so-called first-class red stars. Warner Bros. has about sixty people, and Columbia Pictures has fewer.

In addition to the featured red stars, film actors can also be divided into four levels: leads, supporting roles, speaking actors, and extras. Those who have considerable skills, those who are proficient in dancing, singing, and swimming, can be lead actors. The salary of a lead actor is at least $500 per week. The salary of a supporting actor is between $250 and $1,000 (per week). There are very few long-term contracts. The so-called speaking actors and extras are recruited on a temporary basis. Those who can open their mouths and say one or two irrelevant sentences are one level higher than extras who are purely "running errands." Speaking actors can earn $25 to $100 per day, and extras are prescribed $16.50 per day.

It Takes About One Hundred Days to Make a Film

I asked producers from several film companies, and their answers were almost the same: the time required to complete a film is twelve to fourteen weeks, unless there are unavoidable circumstances as exceptions. Extras must be on set every day during the filmmaking process, because there are many details that must be reshot, two or three times, or even more than ten times!

Extras are required to work six days a week, eight hours a day. If the factory needs overtime work beyond eight hours in order to catch up with the work, the factory will pay compensation at one and a half times the original wage. John Ford, an employee of 20th Century Fox who accompanied me on the tour, told me: there is very little photography at night. The night scenes on the screen are all faked with lights.

Agents - Powerful Behind the Scenes

The most incredible thing is the "agents" of film actors. These people are the most authoritative behind-the-scenes figures in Hollywood. Their "great power" amazed me. Through their palms, red actors can turn black, and young, inexperienced youngsters can become famous overnight.

From the top red stars to the sixteen-dollar-fifty extras, almost everyone who appears on the screen and makes a living by acting in movies has his agent. When the factory wants to make a film and needs so many people and roles, they first notify their agents. The agents, like organizing a cabinet, submit a list within a few days, and then the producer considers, compares, and selects from many lists. The list rarely adopts a uniform approach, and mostly adopts a "mixed cabinet" approach.

Many top red stars like to sign long-term contracts. Signing long-term contracts must also go through agents. The agents discuss with the boss, and bargain with the stars. They run between the boss and the actors, taking a fraction of the commission. These agents are all top-notch talents. They have "connections" and "methods." In Hollywood, they are all-powerful!

Actors Guild - Also an Authoritative Organization

In addition to agents, there is also the "Actors Guild," which is also an authoritative organization. If you want to gain a foothold in Hollywood, it is absolutely impossible without the support of the guild. The membership fee for actors, regardless of size, is one hundred dollars, and the annual membership fee is eighteen dollars. It is said that applying to join the guild is a rather difficult thing. It is the gateway to entering the Hollywood professional circle!

The guild is currently suspending the recruitment of any new members, because they feel that there are already too many actors in Hollywood now (especially extras). This is the strictest way to exclude "newcomers." However, if it is a truly newly discovered "genius," or a "buried beauty" discovered by a film company's big boss, that kind of person still has no problem.

Mysterious? Agents, guilds, this is the inside of Hollywood. Peeling off Hollywood's coat, and seeing through its behind-the-scenes dynamics, that is truly mysterious!

White Lotus Creek Vegetable Vendors Call for Help

Editor:

In the past, we were a group of workers from nearby factories. After August 13th, the factories shut down. To make a living, we had to borrow small amounts of capital and sell vegetables within the designated area of Lane 158, Bailianjing Road, under the jurisdiction of the police station. Unexpectedly, last winter, a local man, Jiang Helin, raised funds to build a simple shed as a commercial vegetable market, hoping to make a big profit. We were unanimously dissatisfied at the time, and local impartial people helped us to voice our opposition, so it did not happen. Recently, Jiang Helin has made a comeback and is trying to force us to sell inside the market through various channels. However, we believe that it is illegal for Jiang Helin to charge us rent for the shed, so we firmly oppose it and are unwilling to enter the market, resisting the wealthy who want to profit from the poor. Therefore, we appeal to all impartial people for assistance. (Forced vegetable vendors Cai Miaogen, etc.)

### Revival of the Sulfuric Acid Industry

— Tianjin, 22nd (Airmail Dispatch) Our Correspondent Li Shaolin

The production of sulfuric acid indicates the degree of industrialization of a country. According to estimates in 1931, the annual sulfuric acid production of modern countries in the world at that time was almost seven million to ten million tons. In our country, apart from a few arsenals that had acid-making equipment for their own needs, other industrial acids were almost entirely dominated by Japanese companies. A large amount of sulfuric acid was shipped from Japan, earning profits five times or more, directly and indirectly exploiting Chinese industry and destroying Chinese industry.

Lizhong Acid Plant - Establishment Process

In 1932, through the efforts of Mr. Zhao Yanqiu, Tianjin Lizhong Sulfuric Acid Company was announced to be established. The Chemical Engineering Research Institute of Nankai University presided over the entire design work. Finally, in 1934, Lizhong Sulfuric Acid Plant's domestically produced sulfuric acid came into being. This was not a miracle. It was merely the result of the efforts of many people with perseverance and vision. Japanese people would not allow this emerging Chinese industry to develop. Therefore, after Lizhong Sulfuric Acid Plant began to ship goods, Japanese companies immediately launched an offensive. At that time, the North China sulfuric acid market was entirely controlled by the three Japanese companies, Daqing, Shimizu, and Jinshan. They first used low-priced dumping to put tremendous pressure on Lizhong Acid Plant. Each box of Japanese-produced sulfuric acid, weighing 200 pounds, originally sold for 70 or 80 yuan. In order to defeat Lizhong, Japanese merchants crazily lowered the price to 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and even to their possible lowest price of 12 or 13 yuan per box. The raw materials used by Lizhong were originally purchased from Guangdong, Yingde, Spain, and other places, with high cost prices. Under the joint attack of Japanese companies, it almost reached the point where it could not be sustained.

Repeated Sabotage - Japanese Merchants Fail Miserably

At the most difficult stage, Lizhong's chief engineer Jiang Zidan discovered that the sulfuric acid stone picked out from the Kaiquan Coal Mine could be used as raw material, which was discarded at Kaiquan. After this research was successful, the cost per box for Lizhong was reduced to 7 yuan. Therefore, Lizhong launched the most violent counterattack against Japanese merchants. At this time, the Japanese came up with another trick to strike at Lizhong, pointing out the white smoke coming from Lizhong's chimney, finding fault with it, saying that it contained sulfur trioxide and was harmful to the respiratory organs of Tianjin people, and forcing the plant to shut down. After hearing the news, Nankai University President Zhang Boling sent Nankai chemical experts to Lizhong by car. He said: "Today is like fighting a war. The enemy has attacked our doorstep. If we cannot remove the white smoke, we cannot leave!" As a result of research and improvement, no more white smoke was seen in the chimney. The Japanese did not give up on this. They also smuggled sulfuric acid from Qinhuangdao to North China, but Lizhong more quickly lowered the price of its products and sold them to the market. After several years of struggle, the Japanese sulfuric acid market in North China finally collapsed. As a result, the steel mills, wire nail factories, and enamel factories operated by the Japanese in Tianjin at that time could not but rely on Lizhong to supply sulfuric acid. The Japanese regarded Lizhong as very magical and twice requested to visit Lizhong, but both requests were rejected.

Expand Business - Prepare for Branch Plant

Lizhong's daily production volume was only over three tons. For Shandong's annual need of 1,500 tons, it could only supply 700 tons at that time. In 1936, Lizhong discovered that the sulfur stone produced in Boshan was even better in composition than Kaiquan's. In 1937, it purchased 50 mu of land outside the North Gate of Jinan to prepare for the establishment of a branch plant, with a planned daily production of 20 tons. It was in the planning and construction phase when the July 7th Incident occurred, and the plan for the Jinan branch plant was suspended. The Tianjin main plant was also taken over by the Japanese. From when Lizhong shipped goods in 1934 to the outbreak of the war of resistance in 1937, the total production of sulfuric acid was over 3,000 tons, recovering a loss of 2 million yuan at that time and maintaining the livelihoods of over 1,200 people at that time.

Repair and Resume Work - Supply Needs

Mr. Zhao Yanqiu came to Tianjin from the rear in the autumn of 1946. After several months of hard work, he recovered the factory from the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. He also appealed to all parties for loans and repaired the dilapidated equipment. Now the factory has started shipping goods again, and the output is close to the pre-war output, producing over three tons per day. What he regretted most at that time was that Chief Engineer Jiang Yuzan had died in Tianjin in 1942. Lizhong Sulfuric Acid uses the lead chamber method. The equipment in the factory has a total of 14 ore furnaces. After the ferrous sulfide is burned in a furnace, it passes through the storage and settling chamber to the Ge Tower, nitric acid is added, and then it passes through three lead chambers for continuous heating to increase the concentration and eliminate impurities to obtain sulfuric acid. The concentration of sulfuric acid produced is 66 degrees Baumé. Regarding the story of the "white smoke," after improved treatment, the gas produced after heating the ferrous sulfide must pass through four smoke collection devices. The inside of the smoke collection tower is made of ceramic tiles to condense the gas into liquid. After passing through the cooler, it passes through a smoke collection box filled with coke, so that the white smoke adheres to the coke. Finally, it is discharged through the neutralization tower and white chimney. Now, in addition to sulfuric acid, Lizhong also produces over a thousand pounds of nitric acid per day. In addition to its own use, it has already ordered over 200 million yuan of nitric acid, while sulfuric acid has ordered over 400 million yuan.

After the victory, the Japanese left us three sulfuric acid plants. There is one plant each in Fushun and Anshan, but the damage is severe and there is no hope of repair. In addition, there is a plant in Huludao, which was designed by a German engineer hired by the Japanese. It is now operated by the Resource Committee Chemical Company. The equipment is designed to produce 100 tons per day, but it has not yet shipped any goods. It is expected to produce 50 tons after resuming production. The Kaicheng Sulfuric Acid Company in Shanghai has also not been repaired to this day. At present, Lizhong is the only plant responsible for supplying domestic industrial needs. Lizhong has been revived, and China's acid-making industry has also been revived.

### Serious Flooding in Guangdong and Guangxi; Hong Kong Busy with Relief Efforts

— Hong Kong, 25th Dispatch by Airmail. Special Correspondent, Cheng Zhizheng

The extent of the flooding in Guangdong and Guangxi this time is unprecedented in a century. Over forty counties in Guangdong Province have been affected. In Guangxi Province, among its ninety-two counties, fifty have been hit by the disaster. In Huiyang, Guangdong, the water level reached twenty-eight feet, affecting more than 200,000 people. Thousands of houses were destroyed, and the number of deaths of people and livestock is impossible to count. The rest, including Heyuan, Boluo, Gaoyao, Zhongshan, Luoding, Yinan, Qingyuan, Sihui, Dongguan, Xinfeng, Nanhai, Sanshui, Longmen, Yingde, Heshan, Huaxian, Conghua, Zengcheng, and Deqing, have all suffered severely. The harvest is hopeless. Although there are no detailed disaster reports from Guangxi Province, the severity of the situation is self-evident.

Since receiving news of the floods in Guangdong and Guangxi, the people of Hong Kong immediately launched a fundraising campaign for disaster relief. They organized the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Community Joint Relief Fund for the Guangdong-Guangxi Floods," and began soliciting donations everywhere. The Guangdong Flood Emergency Relief Association sent three committee members, Lin Yizhong, Wu Zhimei, and Luo Jiqun, to Shanghai to appeal for help. At the same time, the Hong Kong Relief Fund, led by Xu Jiliang, chairman of Tung Wah Hospital, sent representatives to Guangzhou to discuss the allocation of relief funds in detail. These days, the entire city of Hong Kong is busy helping the dead and injured. The amount of money raised has already reached nearly HK$300,000. The Gold and Silver Exchange Market has contributed the most, donating HK$150,000. Mr. Hu Wenhu donated a total of more than HK$40,000 in cash and medicine. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company also donated HK$30,000 on its own. The China Overseas Chinese Daily launched a charity sale and raised more than HK$10,000 in one day. Now restaurants, tea houses, hawkers, etc., are holding charity sales, and theaters and troupes are holding charity performances. Students across Hong Kong have launched a campaign to raise HK$5 per person. The total amount of donations is expected to reach HK$500,000 (approximately 500,000 yuan in national currency).

Regarding the distribution of relief, all sectors have also discussed at one time. To avoid embezzlement and ensure that the victims can truly benefit, it is planned that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Gold and Silver Exchange Market will organize a supervisory relief team to assist the provincial government in distributing relief. The spirit of Hong Kong people's own drowning, enthusiastic disaster relief, is really rare.

### Hissing Sounds from the Shenyang Locomotive Factory

— Shenyang, 23rd Dispatch by Airmail. Special Correspondent, Han Qingtao

The Northeast is in a state of great destruction and ruin! Here is a report about a healthy and praiseworthy "Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant." Seeing its role, we feel the importance of the Northeast, and we must not allow it to suffer destruction and ruin again.

It is a zone near the scenic areas of "Beiling" and "Tawan," with several factories covering a large area. Smoke rises, and from afar, you can hear a continuous ding-dong sound. That is the "Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant," located in Huanggu District, Shenyang.

It is a unit of the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in Shenyang, and also a large factory in the Tiexi and Huanggu industrial zones of Shenyang that can emit smoke from a few chimneys today.

This is a main factory, including four plants: locomotives, rolling stock, forging and casting, and repair and maintenance. In addition, there are "Tiexi Factory" and "Shenyang Automobile Factory" in Shenyang, and two factories in other locations: "Anshan Factory" and "Andong Automobile Factory."

"SASAC Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Co., Ltd." is located in

the main factory. The general manager is Liu Shizhan, and the associate manager is Cao Wen. The company has five departments: general affairs, business, design, engineering, and finance. In addition, there are the factories and various plants.

Having taken over the main factory for a year, the work is not as satisfactory as ideal due to the impact of power and capital shortages. However, with the efforts of all employees, there have been hard-won gains. They manufactured eight 147-ton large locomotives, three 15-ton small locomotives, repaired eleven large and small locomotives, and manufactured 161 freight cars. They also repaired 16 passenger and freight cars, all of which are the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the Chinese people themselves.

These manufactured and repaired vehicles have been supplied to the "Northeast Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications," "Fuxin Coal Mine," "Beipiao Coal Mine," "Yanhe Coal," "Xi'an Coal Mine," "Benxi Coal and Iron Company," "Anshan Iron and Steel Company," "Liaoning Cement Company," and "Taiwan Sugar Corporation" for use.

The production quantity scheduled for the entire year of 1947 is as follows: manufacturing twelve 147-ton large locomotives, twenty 15-ton small locomotives, and 600 freight cars; repairing thirty large locomotives and 200 freight cars. Currently, the cost of a large locomotive is approximately 2.5 billion yuan in national currency. An American locomotive costs approximately US$120,000 to US$140,000, which, calculated at the black market rate, is only half the price in national currency.

The total weight of a large locomotive is 103.4 metric tons, and the required man-hours are 6,451. There is forging, casting, drilling, welding, and all kinds of technical work. The man-hours of the special factories are not included.

To manufacture a large locomotive, only the air brakes, boiler tubes, and tire rings purchased from abroad need to be assembled before it can be fired up and leave the factory. Except for the boiler tubes, all parts for the small locomotive can be manufactured in the Northeast. This is because the incomplete factories in the Northeast are currently unable to produce air brakes, boiler tubes, and tire rings.

The

materials used to manufacture freight cars, apart from wood, cotton yarn, and paint, are supplied by the following units: steel materials, wheel axles, hooks, springs, malleable iron, screws, rivets, air pipes, axle oil, copper, lead, zinc, and other direct materials; oxygen, calcium carbide welding rods, electrical materials, bituminous coal, coke, and other indirect materials; all supplied by the SASAC's Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Shenyang Machine Factory, Shenyang Chemical Factory, Shenyang Rubber Factory, Fushun Mining Bureau, Fuxin Coal Mining Company, Benxi Coal and Iron Company, Northeast Metal Mining Company, and Shenyang Electrical Factory, forming an inseparable whole.

The inability to solve all the difficult problems in the Northeast has been blamed on transportation. At the steel conference, the success or failure of reviewing various plans for Anshan depends on transportation, and the difficulty of transportation is due to insufficient vehicles. The Shenyang Locomotive Factory's Third Product: New Locomotive No. 5 (Reviewed by Special Correspondent Han Qingtao)

In 1944, during the enemy and puppet occupation era, the Northeast Railway had a total of 2,376 locomotives and 41,741 freight cars, with annual freight traffic reaching 33 billion ton-kilometers, transporting approximately 70 million tons of goods.

According to a survey in January 1947, the Northeast had taken over 600 locomotives and 5,400 freight cars. Among them, 1,400 belonged to the North China Railway. These meager assets are subject to great destruction. We see the hard work of driving each nail into the locomotive, and the workers layer by layer of mining, we also see the painful scene of locomotives overturning on damaged bridges or turning into scrap iron with a loud crash.

The main materials required by the locomotive and rolling stock manufacturing plant are steel from Anshan and coal from Fushun and Fuxin. Materials from Jilin. Currently, wood is mostly in the Communist-controlled areas, making it difficult to obtain. Steel and coking coal are also restricted by transportation.

In addition, there is the

electricity problem. The Xiaofengman power line has been cut off. Apart from the piecemeal supply of electricity from the Power Bureau every day, the factory uses locomotives as the driving force to generate 4 million watts of electricity. However, it is still far from solving the entire problem.

Important materials that must be purchased from abroad have been approved by various government councils for US$400,000, and are being ordered abroad and will arrive successively.

The company's five-year expansion plan has been submitted by the SASAC to the Supreme Economic Council. If the Dalian plant (manufacturing small locomotives) is also taken over, then after five years, the annual output can reach 200 locomotives, 200 passenger cars, and 4,000 freight cars.

The historical record of the locomotive and rolling stock factory is as follows: When the Japanese militarists' continental policy poured into the Northeast in 1938, there was a "deep-rooted" trend. The Japanese "Akiyama Masahachi" and "Manchuria Railway" successively raised 30 million yen to establish "Manchuria Rolling Stock Co., Ltd." Construction began in May 1939, engaging in the manufacture of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars.

In 1942, 599 freight cars were manufactured. In 1944, 41 locomotives were manufactured. It is said that this was affected by wartime labor and materials, and theoretically only reached half of the production.

After the Northeast was recovered, the Soviet army arrived in Shenyang and took over the factory. For some reason, they dismissed our workers, leaving the Japanese and Soviet employees to maintain the repair work.

When the Soviet army withdrew, they did not have time to dismantle and relocate, and only managed to move 75 important machines. Although this greatly damaged the vitality, there was still something that could be done.

At the end of March 1946, the National Army stationed in Shenyang, and the relevant departments

took over the factory. In May, it was renamed "Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant of the Ministry of Economic Affairs." The Japanese were dismissed, and our workers were recruited. At the beginning of June, 100 kilowatts of electricity were obtained, and work began. By the end of September, the first locomotive rolled off the assembly line, and 15 freight cars were also manufactured, and two old locomotives were repaired.

On October 1, it was renamed its current name, and production began according to plan. June 19 marked the first anniversary of their resumption of work.

The industry in the Northeast is a whole, and the manufacturing of vehicles for transportation is an important

link in all industries. We must fully exploit its power and seek the coordination of the entire Northeast industry. Every link must be tight and cannot be loosened.

The importance of the Northeast lies first in the establishment of light and heavy industries. Although they are now dilapidated, the low production volume and equipment are still impressive and rare in the country. Steel, minerals, and factories have all established a good scale and laid the foundation.

Today, efforts are being made to gradually restore the old appearance, but the only condition is stability and construction. Otherwise, everything will be over. To illustrate with facts, the Northeast Communist Army launched the fifth offensive, and the war spread. The "China Textile Company" alone suffered losses of more than one trillion yuan in legal tender in various places.

The flames of war destroyed the industrial and mining production in the Northeast. According to Chen Gongliang, special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance in the Northeast, "The tax revenue in the Northeast was mainly based on the commodity tax on factory and mine products in various places, but due to the power outage, the coal output of Fushun decreased, and most factories in various places were shut down, resulting in a sharp reduction in tax revenue. If the situation does not improve, the future of tax revenue is quite bleak." What a painful report.

The recovery of industry and mining in the Northeast cannot be interrupted in the middle, let alone destroyed. Otherwise, not only will all previous efforts be wasted, but there may be no hope of recovery.

Hearing the roar of the locomotives leaving the factory is exciting and makes people feel a lot of emotions!

Spring and Autumn

### Editorial Notes

— Wang Jinshan

I.

Today, I must first express my personal gratitude and apology to friends in the literary and artistic circles for this publication. I would also like to say a few words to readers who care about this publication.

I have been involved in the editing and proofreading work of this publication for exactly ten months today. Although the time is not too long, I have edited more than 290 issues. If I were a woman and conceived on the day I took over the editing, there should be a baby born today. However, what can I offer today in return for the expectations of friends and readers? To be honest, I just returned from the rear last year, and it was during the recovery period. I had already lost contact with the literary and artistic circles, and even the nature of this publication was a bit vague, so I was just groping around during those four months. As for the six months of this year, although the internal affairs have entered the initial stage of constitutional government, the war has not ended, the country is in difficulty, the people's livelihood is difficult, and the literary and artistic circles are facing an era of misfortune. I am afraid that even subscribing to the newspaper is already a considerable burden for readers.

Although this publication has consulted writers and readers for their opinions from time to time in the past, hoping to work towards everyone's ideals, it has also received instructions and support from many people who are enthusiastic about this publication. Although some of them have been barely accomplished, due to the editor's energy and talent, the valuable instructions have not been fully implemented, and the active support has not been maximized. Even letters from friends cannot be answered in time, and good manuscripts are inevitably shelved for no reason. This is also the reason why it is worth reviewing and saying a few words of nonsense at the end of the half-year today.

II.

Initially, because of the contract, I still taught a few hours at a university in Nanjing. Until this spring—in fact, people who live a nightlife don't know much about spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Several times I went to the station and saw that there were more and more passengers, and they were all wearing spring clothes in pairs. Only then did I realize that spring had arrived, and my train tickets became even more difficult to buy. I had no choice but to ask a friend to take my class.

At this time, I thought that I might be able to spare some time to draw pictures and write manuscripts in the future. Who knew that time was not as leisurely as I imagined, and there would be more trivial matters and annoyances when I was free. Even just sorting out the manuscripts took up as much time as possible. Although I have not worked as a professional editor for a long time before, I have done amateur editing work sporadically for more than ten years. And because I often write and paint myself, I understand the joys and sorrows of writing, so I have an even more devoted heart to cherish other people's works, and I am never willing to spoil other people's minds casually. Once an article is decided to be used, I have to sort it out from the title, paragraphs, sentences, words, and vulgar words, cursive script, typos, etc., along with punctuation marks. Then I plan the format of the layout, the position on the page, etc. And the page I dance on is not fixed. Not only do I have to consider the style of the articles published a few days before and after today's typesetting, so as not to be the same; I also need to pay attention to the matching between the articles published on the same day. I need to seek unity in change and maintain harmony in complexity. The energy spent in this process is far from what writers and readers can imagine. So I can't help but often think of Goethe's words and add endless sadness. When he recalled the situation of co-editing publications with Schiller in 1824, he advised his friends not to be editors, saying:

"Schiller and I spent so much time editing "Die Horen" and "Musenalmanach"; I have recently read our letters and understood everything. I always feel annoyed when I think about that attempt…"

Ten years ago, Wang Tongzhao also talked about the difficulty of editing work when he edited "Wenxue," saying:

"In terms of theory, it should be a rich knowledge, the ability to identify articles, and even more need carefulness and patience. This is not enough, and it must also be accompanied by the ability to cope with the environment."

Indeed, smart people have already been promoted and made a fortune in this era, and editing work is definitely not something that smart people do. For the editor personally, especially those who have a writing habit, it is at least a waste of energy. But then again, if everyone became a smart person, and there were no fools to reflect the smartness of smart people, it would be quite monotonous.

Whenever I was overwhelmed by trivial matters and the hustle and bustle of life, although there were friends who cared for me and advised me not to be too serious, I believed that how could a person who devoted himself to literary and artistic career be confused?

Of course, there are also many brilliant editors who possess the talent of heaven and do not need to worry about this.

III.

Every dusk, the street lights are dim, and sometimes it is inevitable that there is rain and snow. I carry a roll of manuscripts alone from my residence—because I am not used to using a briefcase, I used to wrap it in a piece of kraft paper before March of this year. One day, a friend who cared about me, and also a reader of this publication, discovered it, and gave me a finely crafted and sturdy portfolio-style leather bag that I had used a few times when I was studying at university. This is how I got a more suitable tool. I put the manuscripts received every day in it and took them home late at night, and the next evening I put the selected and edited manuscripts in it and carried them out. I walked a distance, caught a tram, or called a pedicab.

At this time, I can't help but often think that although literature and art are the education of emotions and the history of the human soul, can this career be of any benefit to others? Does this chaotic era need such a relatively fresh spiritual food? Apart from giving readers appreciation and joy, can the purpose of literature and art really make people know a little about the true meaning of society and life? People who read the newspaper understand the social actions of this generation from the news and telegrams. Can they understand the brilliance of the souls of this generation from the supplements? - What kind of reflection does this publication evoke in the hearts of readers?

Although I watched the branches and leaves of the trees along the way wither and then flourish again, and the leather bag I carried with the manuscripts was subjected to frost, dew, wind, and rain every night, it gradually appeared a bit old and was about to break down. I stroked it and could not help but sink into the depths of thought; I was at a loss, just like the street lights, blindly hanging in the silent streets.

IV.

There are many things that move me very much, and thinking about them is like countless powerful whips whipping me; especially the encouragement and praise from friends.

I personally heard several middle school students tell me that their Chinese teacher publicly introduced this publication in class as extracurricular reading material for students; occasionally, they also selected and printed articles published in this publication as Chinese teaching materials. The student bulletin board of a certain school also often copies and reprints short articles from this publication. As for readers selecting a few articles or illustrations to cut out and paste at any time, or saving the entire page, I heard that there are many; I also often receive letters requesting to check previous supplements. There were also several readers who wrote to me, asking to leave the white paper on the left side of the newspaper supplement wider so that they could bind it. Of course, some people have suggested compiling and printing a single book. But these things are not easy to do at this time.

I often think that based on the daily sales of 150,000 copies of this newspaper, with five to ten readers per copy, there are more than 750,000 readers every day. If a hollow or weak manuscript is published, or a word is printed wrong, it will be blamed by more than 750,000 readers. Therefore, it makes people feel even more cautious.

Of course, colleagues in every part of the newspaper, from the editorial department to the typesetting room, often give me a lot of guidance and assistance. What needs to be explained is that this publication is still far from the ideal standard, and it is obvious that not enough effort has been made. This apology revolves in my heart all the time, and I will not shirk this responsibility. But I have to tell the writers and readers these situations frankly. And I hope that submissions can take into account the difficulties of the editor in a negative way, and help this publication enrich its content and improve its standards in a positive way. I also hope to firmly grasp the literary and artistic nature, the lasting sentiment, and the serious style of this publication. Let's cultivate, till, and irrigate together, so that the literary and artistic garden that is attacked by wind and rain day and night can still bloom a beautiful and wonderful flower. - This is everyone's ideal.

I don't want to say much about the nature of this publication today. In short, creative translations of literary and artistic departments, as well as research reports, and literary and artistic memorial texts with time significance are all welcome. And what is needed most recently are short stories of less than 3,000 words, literary theories of 1,000 to 2,000 words, essays and miscellanies of around 1,000 words, and short literary articles of less than 100 words. The rest have already been published in the solicitation rules, so I will not go into detail.

The so-called timelessness is just a kind of flavor in an article, lively as flowing water, crystal clear as a stone, elegant as distant mountains outside the window, vigorous as old pines on the top of a peak, and close to feelings and reason, kind and tasty. This kind of article can make people think after reading it, and read it again after thinking about it. From the opposite point of view, it is to avoid unnecessary branches and leaves, avoid being rigid and crude, and avoid being far from real life. The Greek critic Dionysius criticized Plato's writing style, saying:

"His writing style can be seen everywhere as bright and transparent, as if it were clear spring water, and it is particularly accurate and wonderful. He only uses ordinary words, strives to be clear, and does not add embellishments. His classical words are antique, showing a kind of joyful charm, beautiful and powerful, like a gust of gentle wind blowing from a fragrant meadow…"

I also often think that no matter what the content or what style of writing, even if it is not a literary work, it should give readers a kind of aesthetic feeling of words; let alone articles published in literary publications?

The meaning of seriousness here is only in terms of the choice of theme, the perspective of material selection, and the ability of writing. This is not a moralistic style that is forced out with a long face, but on the contrary, the so-called "sages do not forbid what cannot be avoided by human feelings"; however, it is not necessarily possible to make a literary work out of a full page of romanticism and a sad mood. Works use true words to express life, and naturally they must be full of human touch. If you can treat the article itself as a work of art, you must work as hard as creating a work of art when writing, and not indulge your own skills, modify and delete; after the first draft is written, they have the same important value. I can say unceremoniously that I often boldly embellish many submissions before sending them out for typesetting. I also often receive many letters requesting to modify manuscripts, but unfortunately I have not done it well due to time constraints, which is also a very regrettable thing. - Therefore, I can only sincerely hope that writers with a long history of writing will often contribute excellent works to serve as examples.

At the time when the summer vacation is starting in various schools and a long summer is coming, everyone's life may be a little more relaxed. Therefore, I would like to ask the literature teachers of major middle schools, the students of the literature departments, and friends in the literary and artistic circles to give this publication more guidance and assistance, and to write a few solid and beautiful articles and send them to this publication: the editor is here waiting with eager feelings!

### The Heavenly Music

— Rossetti

Rossetti (D.G. Rossetti 1828-1882) was originally Italian, but because he grew up in England, many historians classified his paintings in the English school.

He not only had a high talent for painting, but also had literary cultivation, and could write poetry and beautiful articles. He was the leader of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

The characteristics of his works are rich in meditation, illusion, romance and literary meaning. Representative works include "Dante's Dream," "Daydream," and "The Heavenly Music," etc. (Liu Shi)

### Beethoven and "Force"

— Shadow

Among the great musicians who shake people's hearts, I prefer Beethoven to Mozart, Bach, Chopin, and others. This is not only because of his heroic force (Romain Rolland said he was "the embodiment of force") but also because of his noble and aloof character. Mr. Fu Lei said it well in his article "Beethoven's Works and His Spirit":

"To affirm this 'self,' to liberate the individual before emperors and nobles, to make them recognize that each individual is an emperor and noble, or that each emperor and noble is a commoner, one must affirm 'force,' cultivate it, nurture it, bring it forth, and concretely express it, so that people cannot but accept it. Every free 'self' wants to command. If he cannot command in action, at least he can command in art. If he cannot conquer kingdoms like Napoleon, at least he must conquer hearts and emotions, like Beethoven. Yes, Beethoven and force, this is a natural topic." (Beethoven's Biography, page 110)

Many of Beethoven's pieces are his venting of force, his declaration of force. He had his motto: "Force is the morality of those who are different from ordinary people, and it is my morality." However, despite this, he did not fall into the quagmire of Nietzschean supermanism. Nietzsche's expression of "force" is to try to lift oneself up by one's hair to ascend, to break away from the mediocrity and soar freely; Beethoven is not like that. He used his talent to teach mankind that they should use "force" to resist and conquer suffering and fate; and they should use "force" to encourage and passionately love their brothers. In the "Missa Solemnis," he appealed on behalf of humble mankind and sang for the sufferers; in the "Ninth Symphony," he wanted to liberate and expand people from pain and struggle. In this way—

"As a result of liberation and expansion, man and divinity approach each other, uniting with divinity. At that time, force is God, man is force, there is no good or evil, no conflict, and the duality of force disappears." (See Beethoven's Biography)

This admirer of "force" actually had a spirit higher than "force" restraining him, and that was his character. He was deaf, so he was accompanied by the immortal "eternity"; his rugged life was not enough to prove the tragedy of his career, but instead showed the irrationality of this world. In his life, he was constantly fighting against vulgarity, physically, circumstantially, and spiritually... at the same time, he was wielding his weapons on several fronts, but he never failed. No, even in such a battle, he was constantly boasting courage to the poor human beings. Every song of his can be regarded as a "declaration of force." He once wrote to his nephew: "Our era" needs powerful minds to whip these poor crowds." Please do not think this is his arrogance; precisely because his wise eyes saw through the despicable and insidious scenes of the human world, precisely because his whole body was filled with the spirit of struggle, he said such words with the ambition of a saint.

In a letter to the pianist Czerny, he said:

"When your students play the piano with proper fingering, accurate rhythm, and fairly harmonious notes, you only need to pay attention to the style, do not interrupt him for small mistakes, but wait until the end of the piece to tell him. — This method can cultivate a "musician," and this is the first thing in musical art."

The training of skills is one thing, and the cultivation of the mind is another. Beethoven paid more attention to the latter. Please see the "musician" mentioned in the above letter. Why did Beethoven emphasize it so much? — His meaning is not equal to saying: It is a musician! Definitely not a musical artisan!

### A Century-Long Plan—Hopes for the Preparatory Office of the Art Museum

— Yu Jianhua

Chinese painting flourished in the Tang Dynasty, reached its peak in the Song Dynasty, changed in the Yuan Dynasty, diverged in the Ming Dynasty, and declined in the Qing Dynasty. It has increasingly deteriorated, with each generation being inferior to the previous one. In the past hundred years, the art scene has been in mourning and chaos, which has long been sighed upon by insightful people. In addition, the import of Western painting has brought both internal and external troubles, further hindering the development of Chinese painting. Now, at the beginning of the preparation for the Shanghai Art Museum, it is planned to hold an exhibition of paintings from the past century as a preliminary step to promote research, gradually improving like eating sugarcane upside down, so that viewers are shocked by the decline of the modern art scene and recall the magnificent achievements of the Tang and Song Dynasties. This will revive and reform the art scene and strive to promote the movement of literary and artistic revival. This is a great event.

To cure a disease, one must first examine its source. Modern painting suffers from a variety of ailments, the root of which lies far back in the early Qing Dynasty and more recently in the late Qing Dynasty. To understand why modern painting is as it is, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive review of painting in the past century, find the root cause of the disease, and take remedial measures before it is too late, so as not to run the risk of administering the wrong medicine.

In a village of ten households, there must be honest and trustworthy people; in a century, how could there be no outstanding talents? If we can collect a wealth of works and compare them, then the flaws and merits will be visible, the jade and the stone will be distinguished, and there may even be outstanding works that have been overlooked, which, once discovered, will surely be a surprising discovery.

Painting in the past century is actually the father of modern painting. Although the father has failed to carry on the family tradition and promote it, his contribution to connecting the past and the future cannot be obliterated. However, the era limits people, and the environment limits people. Even if there are extraordinary talents and abilities, they cannot transcend the era and break through the environment. If we had been born seventy or eighty years earlier, we would probably only absorb the remnants of the Four Wangs, and our achievements would not necessarily surpass Lu Lianfu. If we were at the same time as Ren Bonian, we might not be immune to his influence and become a follower of the Shanghai School. Extreme prosperity must be followed by decline, which is a natural law. In this time of decline, even with great effort, it is impossible to reverse the trend. To lightly despise and dismiss it with a single stroke is not fair. We should not belittle the ancients and love the moderns. Without the ancients, there would be no moderns, and without the moderns, how can we continue the legacy of the ancients!

What I hope for from the preparatory office of the art museum is not only to hold exhibitions of various eras, but also to have the government allocate sufficient funds to purchase and collect masterpieces from past generations and display them regularly. Although we cannot be as complete as the museums and galleries of France, Britain, and Italy, we must at least rival the Palace Museum in Beijing and serve as a general collection of Chinese art. This century-long plan is just the beginning.

### Thinking of My Deceased Friend Teng Ruoquan by Moonlight

— Yu Xinwu

Too much emotion shortens one's youth, let alone a talent like you. Alas, the world is shaky and declining (Ruoquan was in Yunnan, and he was often unhappy. He once wrote a poem about decline and sent it to Qian Binxin). The articles are uniquely crafted. The brocade and silk are only dreams of the past. The zither and se are played with sorrow (You and your wife were not harmonious). The night is beautiful tonight. Where is my old friend?

### Life Span Has an End

— Yu Xinwu

Life span has an end, and heaven and earth have a limit; only this spiritual realm is vast and intangible; hanging in the air for tens of thousands of generations, everything, big and small, is reduced to dust; the universe is originally vast, but it is fragmented here; alas, empty prince, annihilation is the end.

### Summer Day

— Hu Yingdong

The intense sunlight pours down on the earth, and the earth sighs under the sunlight. The ocean breeze carries the heat, blowing towards this bustling city in gusts. The commotion in this city is more urgent than before. Watching the flow of people and vehicles and the flying dust, I involuntarily feel a sense of suffocation and fatigue surging in my heart.

Summer, a scorching season, brings city dwellers sweat for life, the invasion of epidemics, and the threat of heat and light...

I wander the streets on a summer day, carrying a scorching sun, walking forward numbly and mechanically. "Where are you going?" My answer is to go to the slaughterhouse of life to exchange for a ration; in silence, I mean that this hot season is indispensable for depression and panting.

Two

The summer in the city has an extremely uncoordinated aspect. It stretches between people like a deep ravine. If you are a tourist in this city, you can see the poor sweating cheaply, eking out a living on the edge of death and hunger, while the children of the rich comfortably stay in air-conditioned restaurants, singing and dancing sweetly.

Hot weather is a threat to the poor, but for the rich, it has a charming sentiment built on money.

Some people regard midsummer as a cruel tyrant, ruling the creatures on the earth, distilling the common people until they are scorched with its intense light. When people smell his footsteps, who does not curse him from the bottom of their hearts!

Facing the scorching fire, the barren wind and sand, dragging a dried-up skin to pass this dull day, I desperately fell into a nightmare, dreaming of a desert-like world, dreaming of the fierce face of the sun god, dreaming of him pouring down the oppressive heat.

Four

So the cowardly poets are trembling, the shameless are singing, the clowns are hiding in the cool pavilions to escape, and the earth is plunged into dead silence.

Looking at this long, long night, I feel that my fantasy is powerless?

### Shield

— Zhong Zhi

In the museum, I saw a shield.

The shield aroused my deep thoughts...

Through this shield, I saw the ancient heroes - holding a long spear in one hand and a shield in the other, passing through thousands of troops and tens of thousands of horses, invincible wherever they went.

Through this shield, I saw the ancient war - the general riding on horseback, the soldiers holding crossbows, blindly shooting in a mess. The two generals met, the drums kept beating, the two horses crossed, the spear and shield, the knife and gun, mixed into a large piece...

Let's touch it, this shield that has experienced vicissitudes!

Suddenly, I felt...

Why use a shield? Why not shoot back an arrow at those who shoot me? Why not stab back with a spear at those who stab me? But use a shield to block it?

True heroes do not need shields. Those who use shields are not true heroes.

True heroes use arrows to shoot to death those who shoot me. True heroes use spears to stab to death those who stab me.

The shield is the weapon of cowards. It is the carapace of the weak, the amulet of fools.

True heroes do not need shields; those who use shields are not true heroes.

### Random Talks on Solitary Mooring

— Wang Cong

I think that when a person's appearance is most still, it is often when his heart is most disturbed. Because when a certain aspect of emotion cannot be vented, one has to pretend to be calm to stabilize oneself. That is, to return to one's own world - to hide in memories.

I also believe that the sum of the life enjoyed by each person will not be too different, but each person has a different percentage of what he or she takes.

This difference in the importance of taking or giving can be used to explain the difference in the value of each person's life.

If every energy that exists in the present world can be discovered sequentially and can be fully utilized for favorable use, then it is too ideal.

The progress of things is really too fast. The rope of spiritual civilization cannot be fastened tightly, and it cannot even hold the world of atoms. I am worried that due to a momentary mistake by someone, the prosperity of mankind will be destroyed.

Lao Tzu said: "Knowing the constant is called clarity." "Constant" can be interpreted as "nature." In other words, Lao Tzu means: "Understanding nature is clarity." And so-called understanding, of course, refers to knowing how to use the power of nature.

The most regrettable thing can be said to be the consumption of force.

L said: "Whenever two forces collide, they will stagnate; just like the crowding at the entrance of the amusement park, no one will be able to pass."

From this, I couldn't help but raise a series of associations about reality.

Or it can be interpreted like this! The entrance to that amusement park is narrow. However, if you can use more reason, abandon selfishness, and in an orderly manner, everyone can walk through that door.

However, selfishness has trapped us.

### Anecdotes About Ruan Ji—Miscellaneous Discussions on Wei and Jin Figures, Part Two

— Zhou Leng

In terms of self-preservation, Ruan Ji seems to be better than Ji Kang. This is not to judge the ancients by success or failure, with one being executed and the other being able to live to the end of his life. I mean that Ji Kang can only achieve passive defense in his feigned madness by tolerating humiliation and concealing flaws and not speaking ill of others, while Ruan Ji can go a step further, embodying satire in his licentiousness, attacking the hidden pain of the powerful, and also knowing when to restrain himself, so as not to give others a handle.

Jin Shu 49, Biography of Ruan Ji:

"Ji originally had ambitions to save the world, but in the Wei and Jin dynasties, the world was in turmoil, and few famous scholars were able to preserve themselves. Ji therefore did not participate in worldly affairs and became addicted to drinking. When Emperor Wen first wanted to propose marriage to Ji for Emperor Wu, Ji was drunk for sixty days and could not speak to stop it. Zhong Hui repeatedly asked him about current affairs, wanting to use his approval or disapproval to bring him to justice, but he was always spared because of his drunkenness."

In such a harsh environment, the timid would either have surrendered or been too frightened to speak. However, no, Ruan Ji was not only not afraid at all, but he went his own way, using white eyes to criticize the scholars of etiquette, and he also wrote a biography of a great man, really mocking these great men:

"The so-called gentlemen of the world only follow the law and adhere to etiquette, holding jade tablets in their hands and walking on the straight and narrow. They are praised by their fellow villagers when they are young and are known to neighboring countries when they grow up. They want to become one of the three dukes in the court and will not lose their position as the governor of Kyushu. But have you not seen the lice in the trousers, escaping into the deep seams, hiding in the worn-out cotton, thinking that it is a good home? They dare not leave the seams when they walk and dare not leave the crotch when they move, thinking that they are following the rules, but when the flames flow and the city is burned, the lice in the trousers cannot get out. Is the gentleman's place in the world any different from the lice's place in the trousers?"

Using lice to describe great men may be a bit inappropriate, but the shortcomings he pointed out of the great men, stubbornly maintaining the status quo, blindly respecting the legal system, and unconditionally supporting it regardless of whether it is right or wrong, and considering reform and progress as rebellion and not thinking about making progress, even if it is used to compare today's scholars and celebrities, it is not necessarily inappropriate.

Ruan Ji's dissatisfaction with reality is not only seen in this passage, but also in his repeated actions of crying bitterly at the end of the road. In my opinion, it was also inspired by his feelings and was not just due to his licentious nerves. Because those who have great talents but cannot develop them either become decadent or become extreme. So he wrote a song: "The sun sets in the west of Buzhou, the moon rises in the middle of Danyuan, the essence of the sun is hidden, and the light of the yin replaces it. The pavilion stops for a moment, and it will soon recover. Wealth and honor are in a flash, why must poverty and lowliness end?" It shows: "The sun has set, the moon has risen, the light is gone, and darkness is spreading, but this is a temporary thing, and soon it will return to its original state. At that time, I can fully express my ambition and will no longer be frustrated." Look, what a sad and angry and positive poem!

Jin Zhi: "Ji once climbed Guangwu and watched the battlefields of Chu and Han, sighing: There were no heroes at that time, so that the boys could gain fame. He climbed Mount Wulao and looked at the capital and sighed, and then wrote a poem about heroes." On the one hand, he was drunk, and on the other hand, he wrote poems about heroes. The thoughts in his heart were mixed with complaints and melancholy. He had to avoid the harm of powerful officials and feared that he would end up unknown. The most contradictory and painful thing in the world is probably this!

### Tragedy of New York Housing Shortage

— Gan Lai

Housing rental disputes in this city inevitably exceed several each day. The housing shortage problem is apparently very serious. Not long ago, this city even saw a tragedy in which a sublessor beat and injured a tenant when demanding they vacate.

But, unexpectedly, even New York, with its title as "world capital," also has a housing shortage, and a shockingly tragic event occurred:

The complete truth is below:

"Mr. Shawl, 50 years old, was an accountant for the United States Shipping Company during the war. After the war, he was laid off and unemployed. He married Ms. Daisy Newson during the war. The couple's relationship was initially very good. A few months ago, his wife invited her older sister and niece to live with them in their small room. Because of this, the couple often argued. Three months ago, the couple fought with each other and were mediated by the police, who were called to the scene, and the matter subsided. At 2:00 p.m. on May 19, while his wife and niece were out, the couple started arguing again. Mr. Shawl actually stabbed his wife in the abdomen with a knife, causing her to bleed profusely. She stumbled out of the room seeking help. Mr. Shawl then stabbed himself inside the room in an attempt to commit suicide. Both husband and wife suffered serious abdominal injuries and their lives were in danger. In a semi-comatose state, Mr. Shawl said to the police, "I wish to die. What is there to love in life anymore?""

What will Shanghai residents who share the same affliction think when they read this?

### A Pale Minstrel—In Memory of Liu Baoquan

— Si Kong Wuji

Baoquan's son, receiving the education of "upper-class people," learned how to curry favor. Excelling in studies, he changed careers to become an official, which is the best business. Baoquan's son prospered.

"What kind of sight are you, showing your face outside like that? Don't do it again tomorrow!" This is the command of the official son to his father, who sings drum ballads. Is this the class obedience that people call for today?

Baoquan accepted his son's words, "Yes, it's time to save face for my son. It's time to enjoy a few years of happiness." Actually, he didn't care about his son's tone. He secretly pondered. Actually, Baoquan returned to his son's mansion, and one more old servant was added to his son's mansion; he was nicknamed Old Master.

"From now on, you are not allowed to smoke opium!"

"Why are you so lazy?"

All were commands and torments.

That was exactly the age of Baoquan in his fifties. All hope was shattered. He finally left the mansion and returned to the drum platform.

This huge stimulus increased his sadness for the world. At the beginning of the drumbeat, he accompanied his story, sometimes happy and sometimes angry, enriching the life of the drum lyrics with natural emotions. He gave people so much sorrow and joy... Although, what he talked about was nothing more than the loyal and filial martyrs of the former dynasty... However, there were also some incalculable blood and tears hidden in it.

Baoquan's health was not very good, and he was getting old. However, in order to make a living, he could only struggle hard. The old hope followed that filial son. Suddenly one day, the owner of Liu's mansion in Tianjin held a celebration for his birthday and sent people to Beijing to invite actors. Inevitably, he invited this drum king. With a generous reward, Baoquan arrived in Tianjin. On the day of the celebration, there was a constant stream of traffic and horses. Baoquan served a section of Hengwu Pass on the stage, winning applause from the whole audience. The host gave a reward, and Baoquan kowtowed to thank the host for his kindness. When he stood up and looked up, he realized that the dignified Lord Liu sitting above was his son.

The silver-haired performer fell down, spitting out a mouthful of blood, and fainted on the ground.

Poor people should not get sick. Sickness makes the poor even poorer. Baoquan's life back in Beijing was even more miserable. And his inner loneliness was even greater than his life's pain. He could not endure hunger, and he could not endure loneliness even more.

--He, this silver-haired, coiled, and clear-faced old performer, stepped onto the drum platform again.

Decades of effort, talent plus tempering, and, more importantly, a desolate life experience and a heart full of love for his family and country. All were poured into every word and every gesture of Baoquan.

The hearts of the audience were all subdued by the desolate, high-pitched, and sometimes slightly hoarse voice.

The drumbeat stopped, and the sound of the clapper faded. This silver-haired performer shook his head like the spiritual light of the Lu Palace, slowly lowering his body, as if giving a salute, and calmly put down the drum hammer. The dream woke up, and the audience forced their eyes to look at the empty stage. They looked at each other, smiled; sadly but pleasantly. Then, they squeezed each other, and noisily squeezed out of the narrow door of the courtyard.

Where was the silver-haired drummer? In the back, he was sipping tea and coughing. Then, dragging his staggering steps, he returned to his broken house.

The War of Resistance broke out. This drum king, who was called Little Baoquan in his youth, was now in his twilight years, and his body was even weaker. Under the brutal atmosphere of the enemy and the puppet regime in Beijing, Zai Wang still exhausted his last voice, shaking and telling the stories of loyal and filial martyrs of the former dynasty.

Like a ripe fruit bidding farewell to the branches, this performer—no, it would be more appropriate to call him a master! I don't know if he left this world very peacefully? Or very desolate?

……

This story was told to me by a deceased old actor. I did not dare to add any embellishments.

The reason why I wrote this essay is to express my personal incomparable respect for this artistic master. (End)

### The Science of Dreams (I)

— Gu Junzheng

Everyone dreams. Some people think they don't dream, but it's actually because they forget them as soon as they have them. There has always been a kind of superstition about dreams, but what is said below is the conclusion reached by scientists after long-term research.

How do dreams come about?

Our mind can be divided into two parts, inner and outer. The outer part is conscious, and the inner part is subconscious. Our desires, fears, frustrations, and wishes are all deeply hidden in the subconscious. When you dream, the barrier between the inner and outer consciousness is relaxed, so your conscious mind can see what is going on in your subconscious mind. This is a dream.

This varies from person to person. Sometimes it is slightly different, sometimes it is completely different. If the personality of the person in your dream is not much different from when you are awake, it means that your psychology is very healthy and your personality is flawless. However, if the person you are in your dream is completely different from when you are awake, it indicates that you have a tendency to have a nervous breakdown.

What types of dreams are there?

The famous British psychologist Dr. E. Graham Howe has found that all dreams can be classified into the following categories:

(1) Dreams of satisfying desires, such as children dreaming of fancy toys, adults dreaming of money, or dreaming of the death of people they don't like.

(2) Dreams of longing, such as dreamers missing the train, climbing bottomless pits, etc. This type of dream indicates the failure of a certain endeavor.

(3) Purposeful dreams, which solve a problem or simulate the steps of an action.

(4) Self-critical dreams, which reveal the shortcomings of the dreamer himself.

(5) Reproduction dreams, in which the dreamer replays the daytime experience.

### Assorted Notes from America

— Xu Tu

Bizarre Occurrences in the Presidential Election

When Roosevelt was running for his fourth term as president, his evenly matched opponent was Thomas Dewey, the governor of New York. The Democratic and Republican parties had roughly the same number of members. Dewey's party members were spread across the United States, but some states were entirely Democratic strongholds, while others were entirely Republican. Newspapers within their respective spheres of influence spoke with one voice, specializing in attacking the opposing party, criticizing private matters, and even delving into personal morality. Several newspapers run by Dewey's people dedicated entire issues to listing Roosevelt's wrongdoings, enumerating hundreds of types of exorbitant taxes. They even listed charitable donations as exorbitant taxes, truly embodying the saying, "If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a charge." Roosevelt had a secret organization that collected ten thousand dollars from anyone who joined as a member. Those who joined as members had to pay a membership fee of ten thousand dollars, with the understanding that they would share in the benefits if the election was successful. Since American parties do not explicitly stipulate the collection of party dues, this ten thousand dollar membership fee was indispensable. Furthermore, by spending ten thousand US dollars in membership fees, those who supported the leader into office would all secure important positions, either as cabinet ministers, provincial governors, or city mayors. A mere ten thousand dollar offering was not excessive. Roosevelt's side was more generous and did not specialize in attacking Dewey. Roosevelt also never gave campaign speeches. Dewey not only gave speeches every day but also published his photos in newspapers and issued countless "Vote Dewey" pin badges. I am not an American, and I have no right to vote. I was grateful when people from Dewey's party gave me a pin badge and pleaded with me to wear it on my uniform. In the end, I wore a Roosevelt pin badge. A few days before the election, Roosevelt's eldest son, Colonel Roosevelt, was sued by a soldier for airlifting his pet dog. Dewey seized the opportunity and attacked Roosevelt mercilessly. The new wife of Roosevelt's eldest son was a Hollywood movie star. Although her private life was somewhat romantic, she also suffered as a result, with scandals spreading everywhere and newspapers reprinting them. In the end, Roosevelt still won, and Dewey lost out on his scheming plans. It is said that he plans to compete with Marshall and Eisenhower next time. (6)

### Gleanings from Manchu Officials' Memorials

— Ji Ming

My maternal great-grandfather, Duke Wensun, loved collecting rubbings of metal and stone inscriptions. After the Republic of China was established, he served in the Beijing Court of Justice, and his collections became even more numerous. When I was a child, I often visited my maternal family and was able to glimpse some of them. Among them were several memorials from Manchu officials. I have recorded those that were particularly witty and flavorful to refresh the weary. One was from an official named Jinlu, who signed himself as "Your Slave," and it roughly stated: "Your slave has heard that in the south of China, there is a great country called Japan. Japan is the origin of the sun..." Following this was an imperial edict from Empress Dowager Cixi, which stated: "Since it is said to be the origin of the sun, it is undoubtedly to the east of China. This official has falsely claimed it to be in the south, which shows that he has read little geography and is unlearned. He is ordered to attend lectures on geography at the Imperial Clan Court once a day." Another memorial, the name of which I have forgotten, roughly stated: "Your slave compares the compassionate thoughts of the Buddha-like Old Lord and worries that it is due to Li Hongzhang's signing of treaties. Your slave believes that Taiwan originally belonged to a desolate place, long estranged from royal civilization, overgrown with weeds and thorns, where rice and grains do not grow. Their customs involve cutting hair and tattooing the body, and their people are naturally wicked and rebellious. Therefore, the rebel Zheng used them to stir up trouble in the marshland, and the rebel Zhu relied on them to jump and frolic in foreign lands. Even if Yao and Shun were reborn, they would be placed among the Four Fiends. Now, fortunately, the Heavenly Japanese kingdom does not ask for anything else but seeks Taiwan. It is fitting to grant them what they desire and cede it to them. Your slave privately predicts that after several years, Taiwan will indulge in their desires day by day, and the Japanese kingdom will be unable to bear their disturbances. When they are locked in a clam-shell struggle, we can seize it with one drumbeat." Following this was also an imperial edict from Empress Dowager Cixi, with beautiful and pleasing calligraphy that stated: "Within the land, there is no land that is not the king's land; under the heavens, there is no subject who is not the king's subject. The court is anxiously concerned about the uneasy borders and is waiting for an opportunity to take action. This official cannot guide the ruler to be like Yao and Shun, but uses twisted words to curry favor. What is his intention?" Looking at the two memorials in general, they are laughable. However, the comments made by the two [Empresses] still have some insight, which shows that Empress Dowager Cixi was not a mediocre ruler. However, she was overbearing, scheming, and narrow-minded. It is fitting to discuss her virtues and not her ministers.
