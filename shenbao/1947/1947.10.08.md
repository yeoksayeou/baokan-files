### Political Declaration of War Between Two Major Camps: We Are Closely Watching the Development; UN Organizations Will Be Sacrificed

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Since the news arrived here that the communist leaders of nine Eastern European nations issued a declaration establishing the "Information Bureau", political figures have paid attention to it. According to a responsible government official, the government is closely watching its development and hopes to obtain more information about it. A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the grounds that sufficient information had not been received, even refusing to comment on whether such noteworthy news from the Soviet Union was diplomatic in nature. The Soviet Embassy has made no additional announcements.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] Great concern has been expressed here regarding the appearance of a new Communist International. Today, reporters separately interviewed political figures Shao Lizi, Chen Lifu, Tao Xisheng, and others to ask for their personal opinions on the matter. Each gave a brief commentary on the matter. (The content of their opinions can be found in the first column of the second page)

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] It is reported that a joint organization of communist parties has also appeared in East Asia, namely the Northeast Administrative Committee jointly formed by the CCP, the Korean Communist Party, and the Mongolian Communist Party. When reporters inquired with officials about this, it was claimed that the government had not yet received any reports regarding this matter.

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 7th] Two years ago, the United Nations was born amid great hope. Today, the United Nations is crestfallen, caught in the political war between the two giants, the US and the USSR, which spans the globe. The division between the two camps is exceptionally clear, but both sides consider France and Italy to be allies. These two countries are the direct stakes in the dispute, as communism and capitalism in those countries will soon clash head-on in the coming months. The Soviet Union's actions (establishing a new Communist International) will have two major effects: The Marshall Plan to aid European recovery will surely be submitted to Congress; The Four Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German-Austrian peace treaty, scheduled to be held in London next month, is likely to fail, and the institution of the Big Four conference may collapse with it. However, UN representatives unanimously believe that the ultimate sacrifice will be the United Nations itself. (For reactions from the US, Britain, and France, see page 3)

At 9:00 PM in the evening, he received over a dozen members of the Beiping-Tianjin-Hebei-Jehol Party and Group Unification Committee.

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Chairman Chiang arrived in the western suburbs at 11:15 AM on the 7th to inspect the Youth Army. The Chairman first ascended the reviewing stand. After inspecting the entire field, he and Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, and Wu Xiaoya, commander of the 208th Division, inspected the parade in jeeps, expressing his deep satisfaction with the soldiers' morale. After the inspection, he returned to the platform to give a speech lasting 40 minutes, generally stating that the responsibility of the revolutionary army is to build a new, independent, free, and strong China, and that the Youth Army has a heavy responsibility and should especially practice what they preach in defending the country and protecting the people. He also emphasized strict discipline, obedience to orders, and setting an example for the general army in their relations with the people. After the speech, he rested briefly at the division headquarters, then inspected the barracks, recreation hall, exhibition hall, and restrooms for about ten minutes before summoning officers above the rank of company commander to give another speech, returning to the city at 1:00 PM.

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] The members of the Military Discipline Inspection Team, led by Li Sicong, called on the Chairman at approximately 5:00 PM on the 7th to report.

The Chairman was extremely concerned upon hearing this and immediately instructed Director Shi to comfort the families of those captured and to provide compensation to the families of those who died in service, in accordance with the rank of military officers and in accordance with the regulations for compensating fallen soldiers. Those who have made particularly meritorious contributions should be formally recommended by Director Shi, and the government will give them commendations, and hopes that they will continue to work hard to fulfill the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation.

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] Chairman Chiang summoned Shi Jue, Commander of the Rehe-Suiyuan Pacification Zone, and Li Wen, Commander-in-Chief of the 34th Army Group, on the evening of the 6th. Shi stated on the 7th that the Chairman had given instructions on the current war situation, saying that the communist bandits will no longer be able to maintain any important strongholds within the Pass, as they have been forced to withdraw from Shaanxi, their political center, and have also been driven out of Shandong, their military center. After Yantai was recovered by the national army, all the arsenals in the Yimeng Mountain area, their supply lifeline, were destroyed, so the communist bandits will only have the option of roaming, and it will not be difficult to eradicate them. There is every confidence in the situation in Northeast China. The Chairman attaches great importance to the coordination between local military and political affairs, and said that in this difficult period, it would be foolish for military and political leaders to fail to cooperate closely. Shi also spoke about the situation in Rehe Province, saying that the attacks on western Liaoning are a result of the national army's withdrawal from eastern Rehe. After the national army captures Lingyuan, it will be able to recover Yebaishou and reopen the Jin-Cheng line. It is expected that the national army advancing eastward will not have to reach western Liaoning before the communist bandits collapse first. The clearing of western Liaoning is a matter of days.

### Tao Xisheng Speaks, Saying the Democratic League Is Propagandizing for the Bandits

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] On the evening of the 7th, a reporter interviewed Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, to ask for his opinion on Director Dong Xian-guang's remarks about the Democratic League. Tao replied: "Our opinion can be represented by the Central Daily News' editorial 'The Self-Determination of the Democratic League,' so there is no need to elaborate. I have another matter to report today. The publishing industry has been quite depressed recently, but the market is flooded with obscene books and communist propaganda books, both of which are poisons that paralyze the youth. The Xinzhi Bookstore and Reading Publishing House in Shanghai publish a particularly large number of communist propaganda books." Tao went on to cite facts to prove that these bookstores are publishing organizations that propagandize for the bandits on behalf of the Democratic League. (For details of Tao's remarks, see the second column of the second page)

It is generally believed that Fu and Chen discussed the joint defense of the corridor between Rehe and Northeast China, as well as the issue of Fu's troops entering the Pass to fight. However, Fu was very reserved, saying that this was his first time in Northeast China, and that he had no other task than to visit Chief Chen. He spoke tirelessly about general issues in Suiyuan and Ningxia. He emphasized the reliability of the people's power, saying that the traffic between Beiping and Baoding depends entirely on the people's protection for security, and that there is not a single soldier along the railway line. At a time when traffic in Northeast China has been completely destroyed by the communist bandits, Fu's earnest words are worthy of our people's consideration.

[Our Shenyang Office, 7th] The development of the Northeast war situation will depend most on the outcome of the Battle of Tieling. The bandits are approaching the city with all their might.

The bandits are approaching Tieling from the north, west, and east in an encirclement. The first station north of Tieling, the Pingjiabao Station, was captured by the bandits at midnight on the 5th. The National Army has moved to the northern suburbs of Tieling, and fierce fighting is taking place in Majiazai, ten kilometers northeast of Tieling. The two sides are thirty to forty miles from the city. The air force has been dispatched to assist.

[Our Beiping Office, 7th] The National Army advancing north along the Beining Line is making rapid progress. Yesterday evening, Suizhong was recaptured and they are continuing to advance. They will be able to join forces with the National Army from Xingcheng in a few days. The communist bandits in that area have been routed.

[United Press, Beiping, 7th] Today, the Shenyang Garrison Command denied reports that Anshan had fallen. It is claimed that Anshan and other coal mining centers in Northeast China remain in the hands of the National Army.

### Political Affairs Meeting Revises and Approves Railway and Postal Subsidy Case; Postage for Regular Mail Will Increase to 1,500 Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Executive Yuan held its 24th meeting on the morning of the 7th, presided over by Premier Zhang. Items discussed: Method for banning the sale of prohibited imported goods: Resolved to carefully study and postpone implementation; Competent authorities for the import and export of military and civilian aviation equipment: Resolved to approve according to the signed opinion; Upgrade of the Vice Consulate in Mexicali, Mexico, to a Consulate: Resolved to approve; Railway, highway, and postal subsidy expenses: Resolved to revise and approve; Increase emergency relief funds to strengthen drought relief in the Ikekhao League: Resolved to approve; Additional business expenses for the Ministry of Transportation's Railway Survey General Office for this year: Resolved to approve; Request from the Ministry of Education for additional food expenses for government-funded students and accommodated students: Resolved to approve.

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The Railway, Highway, and Postal Subsidy Expenses case was revised and approved at the Political Affairs Conference on the 7th. The railway portion is subsidized at 11.2 billion yuan per month, and the highway portion is subsidized at 2 billion yuan per month. It will be implemented after it is approved by the State Council. The postal portion is calculated at a postage fee of 1,500 yuan per regular letter, with a monthly subsidy of 2.8 billion yuan. After discussion, it was initially decided to submit it to the State Council for approval, and then to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei told reporters in the evening that the amount of the subsidy was estimated based on the current cost of negotiated coal. If the price of coal rises, the amount will naturally increase, because the expenses of the transportation industry are mainly for salaries and coal prices, so although the amount has been approved, the Ministry of Transportation still needs to calculate it in detail before submitting it to the State Council.

### Smugglers Use All Sorts of Methods: Opium Hidden in Sneaker Soles; More Than Twenty Smuggling Cases Are Tried Daily in Hong Kong

[United Press, Hong Kong, 7th] Chief Seismograph of the Import and Export Bureau said today. Smugglers use all sorts of methods to smuggle goods from Hong Kong to all parts of China. The inspection authorities work seven days a week, and are busy at night, making it difficult to prevent. Even the bottom layer of sports shoes can be used to hide opium, and the abuses are even greater with boats, vehicles and airplanes.

### Confiscated Smuggled Goods This Year Are Worth Approximately HK$2 Million

From January 1 to September 1 this year, the total value of confiscated smuggled goods was approximately HK$2 million, weighing approximately 20 tons. Most of it was manufactured abroad, 60% was American goods. The warehouse is piled with a large number of sundries such as leather shoes, toothpaste, bicycles, canned food, oranges, glass products, toys, cold cream, biscuits, and chemicals. Most of the alcohol comes from Vietnam, mostly brandy, which is commonly drunk by Chinese. Scottish whiskey is rarely found because only Americans like it. When smuggled goods are seized, the owners often avoid applying, making it difficult to seize both the person and the goods. An average of more than 20 smuggling cases are tried every day, and most have already been convicted.

### Fruit and Penicillin Are Donated to Charitable Organizations

The handling of smuggled goods varies depending on the circumstances. Fresh fruits and perishable items such as penicillin are donated to charitable organizations and hospitals.

### Control Yuan Monthly Meeting: Li Shijun Reports on Inspection Impressions, Many Talented Personnel in Agencies, But Insufficient

[Our Nanjing Office, 7th] The Control Yuan held its monthly meeting on the morning of the 7th, presided over by Yuan Chief Yu. Supervisor Li Shijun reported on the inspection of the implementation of policies in various agencies in the capital, and his impressions. The summary of impressions of the general agencies is as follows: The administration of central agencies should pay more attention to the expression of policies and the proactive leadership. Administrative agencies are complex, with unclear powers and responsibilities, reducing efficiency. Most agencies have too many personnel, and some lack talent. The personnel system still lacks uniformity and soundness. The hiring procedures of agencies and state-run enterprises under the Ministry of Finance are mostly non-compliant. Senior personnel hold too many concurrent positions, especially in the Ministries of Finance and Agriculture. Misappropriation of budget items is almost a universal phenomenon, and business expenses are not submitted for review. Transaction management needs to be effectively improved, especially warehouse management. The impressions of the inspection of financial institutions are that the unrestricted industrial and commercial loan policy in the past has aggravated the fluctuations in the financial market and the skyrocketing prices. In addition, the Ministry of Finance should correct smuggling and tax evasion, and the misconduct of financial personnel. It is also heard that after this inspection, Li has submitted a proposal and an impeachment letter.

### Shanghai Investment Capital Flows to Wuhan and Guangzhou: 15-16 Billion in One Day; Guangdong Military and Political Authorities Discuss Stabilizing Prices

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 7th] Investment capital from Shanghai has been flowing south in a surge recently. According to information received, the Central Bank here received between seventy and eighty remittances from other locations to Guangzhou in one day. Each remittance was in excess of 200 million yuan, with the total reaching 15-16 billion yuan. Currently, Shanghai is restricting the outflow of funds to the south, so most of it is being transferred to Guangzhou via Hankou. As a result, the national currency has increased daily, and the Hong Kong dollar has skyrocketed. On the 6th, the highest exchange rate jumped to 14,400 yuan, and general prices have also risen sharply, causing ordinary people to cry out in misery.

He has also consulted thoroughly with Director Zhang Kuikui to formulate effective measures to stabilize prices and has resolved to punish those who maliciously disrupt the financial system.

Editorial

### The Reemergence of the Communist International

We have learned from news from Europe that the Communist International has once again publicly appeared on the international political stage. We are not surprised by this news. In May 1943, when Moscow announced the dissolution of the Communist International, we already felt that the Soviet Union would not easily abandon this tool that had always been at Moscow's disposal. It was only because at that time it was necessary to please Western democracies, especially to obtain a large amount of Lend-Lease Act materials from the United States, that it announced the dissolution of the Communist International, which had been established in the Lenin era, with a simple announcement. In the minds of discerning people, they all understand that the announcement of the dissolution of the Communist International is nothing more than a trick played by Moscow. The international communist movement and the world revolution movement will not be affected by the dissolution of the Communist International. The reappearance of the Communist International this time is just choosing a time that they consider most appropriate to re-announce the public appearance of this international organization, as if they were playing behind the scenes before, and now they are openly taking the stage. It is no more surprising than the fact that the Chinese Communist Party seemed willing to cooperate with the National Government during the Anti-Japanese War, but one day after the victory, it openly rebelled.

Undoubtedly, the reappearance of the Communist International this time is a direct response to the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. According to reports, the new Communist International declaration issued in the capital of Romania, with the Communist Parties of nine European countries led by the Soviet Union, is tantamount to declaring war on the whole world; and this war is not only limited to ideology, but also extends to politics and even economics, and is a declaration of a comprehensive war, using the power of the working class to fight against what they call "enslaving Europe" "Imperialism." Therefore, the reappearance of the Communist International this time is to re-raise the banner of "anti-imperialist" war, and its main purpose is to attack the United States. We are also not surprised by this posture. Since its establishment in Moscow in 1919, the Communist International has consistently made it its mission to carry out the will of the Kremlin. Before Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, the Kremlin never stopped cursing countries such as Britain and the United States as imperialists. As long as the Kremlin decides how to be most beneficial to the Soviet Union, the Communist International will faithfully carry it out. From 1919 to 1926, the Communist International, led by Zinoviev, advocated world revolution, but in 1928 it became the Communist International that supported the establishment of the Soviet Union, the so-called "socialism in one country." In order to cooperate with the Soviet Union's foreign policy at the time, the Communist International also attempted to get along with the world outside the Soviet Union in a peaceful environment. In 1935, when the Soviet Union's foreign policy changed, the Communist International launched the so-called "People's Front" movement everywhere, attempting to infiltrate it. The subsequent dissolution and today's reappearance are also reflections of the Soviet Union's foreign policy, which goes without saying. So the so-called Communist International is just a tool of the Kremlin!

Speaking of "anti-imperialism," this is something that we Chinese should especially point out. Because today's remnants of imperialism in China, such as unequal treaties, leased territories, and the use of military ports by foreign countries, have mostly disappeared with the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. And at this moment, the "privileges" taken from China during the Tsarist era have now been inherited by the Soviet Union, which is singing the praises of "anti-imperialism," but these "privileges" were originally automatically abandoned by the Soviet Union during the Lenin era. Then the so-called "imperialism" should have a deeper understanding in the minds of the Chinese people today. Then, how should the Chinese people know what to do with the comprehensive "anti-imperialist" war announced by the Communist International this time?

Based on this point of view, the Chinese people have no choice but to stand on a neutral position. Due to the reappearance of the Communist International this time, the division of the world into two camps, the banners are more distinct, and the struggle will become more intense. This is really unfortunate in today's world after the Second World War! But since the situation is like this, if we continue to adopt a perfunctory policy at this time, I am afraid that there will be a second Munich. Therefore, we must not take appeasement measures to increase the arrogance of one party. To criticize and examine its intentions, it seems that it also wants to advocate another "Political Consultative Conference" in the international arena, so that one party can lay down its arms and become the "obedient people" of the other party, in order to revive the "brotherhood" of the "boss" and "second child." If what they say is true, it seems that all the blame in the world should be attributed to the United States "boss," which is helping other countries with post-war reconstruction; isn't this a bit too subjective? We are not saying that everything the United States does is right, but we absolutely disagree with another appeasement like the Chamberlain era in today's world.

The reappearance of the Communist International this time will undoubtedly affect the current situation in China. China, which is based on the Three Principles of the People, is inherently incompatible with communism. Our nationalism and the national politics we advocate are essentially incompatible with the communist totalitarian system centered on the dictatorship of the proletariat. No matter how the international situation changes, we should redouble our efforts to complete the suppression of the rebellion. We hope that the people of the whole country will bear in mind the slogan that "communists have no motherland," and for the sake of our motherland, we will redouble our efforts to complete our mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country as soon as possible!

### Several Political Figures in Beijing Comment on the Communist International

(Continued from Page 1) Shao Lizhi stated that he did not want to express any opinions on this matter, but said that some people believe that this is the revival of the Third International, which is actually a mistake, because the Third International has long been abolished. If you want to give it a new term, you can call it the "Fourth International," and this organization is biased towards Europe and has no major relationship with us. We don't have to consider the path of being pro-Soviet. Yu Jiaju, a member of the Youth Party Government Committee, said that the sharpening of the opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union is indeed a "deterioration" of the current world political trend. In this situation, we can only strengthen unity, clarify officialdom, and engage in construction. Regardless of diplomacy or internal affairs, we should seek independence and autonomy, so as to avoid being involved in this vortex. Some people advocate being pro-Soviet in our future diplomatic front, but we should consider the following four conditions: the return of Lushun and Dalian to our country, whether the Soviet Union can help us solve the CCP problem, whether the Soviet Union can help us build, and whether the Soviet Union can help us resolve the Xinjiang dispute? At the same time, we should especially study under what circumstances the Soviet Union can be friendly to us. Yu believes that the following four conditions must be met: the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China, China's abandonment of U.S. economic assistance, the Chinese government and the public should have goodwill propaganda towards the Soviet Union, and Chinese materials should assist the Soviet Union's construction. Weighing the pros and cons of the above two considerations, whether we can be pro-Soviet or not can be concluded. Chen Lifu, Minister of the Organization Department, said that this matter is not surprising, because the Communist International has already been abolished, but its work has not stopped. This is just a restoration in name only. Several problems in the world are due to strict barriers and failure to coordinate. I sincerely hope that they will tolerate each other and focus on the happiness of all mankind in the world. Wu Zhaoxu, a senator, said that there is no difference between the Communist International and the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union abolished the Third International in 1943, it was out of fear that the United States would have concerns about the Soviet Union.

Cheng Cangbo, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, said that the joint organization of the nine countries in Eastern Europe has two meanings: one is a political offensive against the United States. The United Nations General Assembly is currently being held, and Soviet representative Vyshinsky strongly criticized the United States at the General Assembly. The declaration of the Communist Parties of the nine countries was issued at this time to strengthen the voice of the Soviet representative and imply that the Soviet Union may withdraw from the UN General Assembly if necessary; the other is an economic offensive against the United States. Almost all those who participate in this organization are Eastern European countries. After the Marshall Plan for European economic assistance was announced, the Soviet Union used the Molotov Plan to confront it. This cooperation between the nine countries is an expression of the Eastern European group resisting the United States and the Western European group in economic terms. Tao also said that although this matter happened in Eastern Europe and is aimed at the United States, its impact will never be limited to Eastern Europe, and the whole world will be affected.

### Tao Xisheng Talks About the Content

(Continued from Page 1) I would like to point out a clear fact today, that is, the "A Brief History of China" edited by Fan Wenlan is published by Xinzhi Bookstore. When the CCP headquarters was still in Yan'an, it established a fake Central Research Institute, with Fan Wenlan as the director. Wang Shiwei, a researcher at the institute, wrote an article "Wild Lily," criticizing the Communist Party for lacking humanity. He was severely reviewed by the institute. The "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an on June 28 and 29, 30, carried Fan Wenlan's description of the review process of the fake Central Research Institute, which can be used as a reference. As a result of the review, Wang Shiwei was cruelly punished by the Communist bandits. The fake Central Research Institute and Fan Wenlan's popularity were triggered by this incident. In the name of the Chinese History Research Association, the institute compiled the book "A Brief History of China" in 30 years of the Republic of China, which was published by Xinhua Bookstore in Yan'an. The "Liberation Daily" in Yan'an on December 13 and 14, 30, carried the writing process of the book, and the "Liberation Daily" published an "Advertisement of Xinhua Bookstore in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region," which ranked the advertisement of the book first. (For example, the "Liberation Daily" on April 3, 32, had this advertisement) When Yan'an was recovered by the National Army, the book was reprinted by Shanghai Xinzhi Bookstore. This incident can prove that the publishing business of the Democratic League is just propaganda work for the Communist bandits. The books published by the two bookstores are largely used as a guide for the bandits to launch riots, seize territories, split the territory, and betray the country. Its historical works also seduce young people, despise Chinese history, hate Chinese culture, hurt national self-confidence and self-esteem, and create materials for the Communist bandits to betray the motherland. I would like to call the attention of the academic and cultural circles.

### Li Weiguo Gives Instructions to Employees of Three Newspapers in Shenyang, Announces Adjustment of Military and Party Newspapers

### The Ministry of Economic Affairs Requests Allocation of Vehicles to Rush the Transportation of Huainan Coal; Shanghai Orders to Purchase Enough Coal for Storage

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Huainan coal is the main source of coal for railways such as Zhupu and public utilities in the capital, such as railways and ships. Currently, the mine has a very large amount of coal in storage, and the situation in the mining area is quite tense. For the sake of prevention, the coal in storage should be rushed to Pukou and the capital area for safety.

### Full Report of the Supervisory Yuan

(Continued from yesterday's fifth edition) (F) Investigation of the situation of major import and export trading companies

China Fuzhong Industrial Corporation: This company was jointly organized in the 35th year of the Republic of China by the Bank of Communications, China National Goods Bank, and Jin Cheng Bank. The total capital of the company is 300 million yuan in national currency, divided into 30,000 shares, each share being 10,000 yuan. The Bank of Communications invested 100 million yuan, the China National Goods Bank invested 150 million yuan, and the Jin Cheng Bank invested 50 million yuan. The shareholders of the Bank of Communications were represented by Qian Xinzhi and five others, the China National Goods Bank was represented by Kong Yongzhi and eight others, and the Jin Cheng Bank was represented by Zhou Zuomin and four others. Qian Xinzhi was the chairman of the board, Song Ziliang was the general manager, and Shen Henian and Lu Pinqin were assistant managers. The head office was located in Shanghai, with a branch office in New York. Its business was import and export trade, exclusively managing the goods of American manufacturers, including 12 companies such as Willis Motors and Westinghouse Electric. The company's foreign exchange settlement situation, as of now, has been approved for a total of US$1,585,086.09, with US$137,817.43 of its own foreign exchange. More than 50% was used to purchase cars, 20% was used to purchase wireless communication equipment, and the rest was approved for importing materials. Regarding the company's purchase of automobiles, it was found that it purchased a total of 780 Jeep cars, 101 touring cars, and 2 Cadillac-brand cars. In addition to the Cadillac factory price exceeding the prescribed amount, the Jeep cars were listed under item 25630 of the import tariff, as light-duty trucks under one metric ton. According to regulations, starting from April 29, 1946, their import should have been temporarily suspended. However, the company imported a total of 745 vehicles after May 1946. According to the customs declaration endorsements, a total of 189 vehicles were imported on May 1, May 23, and June 2, which were already en route before April 29. Furthermore, from May 23, 1946, to January 28, 1947, 549 vehicles were imported, which were already purchased before April 29, with cash or letters of credit used to settle the purchase price, and approved for import by the customs in accordance with regulations. After reviewing the documents, they were found to be consistent. However, upon reviewing the company's foreign exchange settlement books, only two orders for 200 Jeep cars were placed on April 10 and April 24, 1946, with a total deposit of US$49,000.00. The remaining US$767,240.00 for Jeep cars was settled after April 29, and more than half were settled successively after August. As for the 101 touring cars, they were permitted to be imported after customs declaration and inspection, based on the government-issued permits MC11-49 and MC11-101, and there were no discrepancies. Furthermore, upon investigating the company's business operations, what warrants attention is the relationship between the head office and the New York branch. According to the company's assistant manager, Lu Pinqin, Fachung Hnternationol Corporation in New York is a branch of Fuzhong Industrial Co., Ltd. The contract to sell Willis cars was also signed by the Shanghai head office, but in reality, the import of Willis cars was negotiated by the New York branch. The head office treated the cars as consigned goods, and all expenses related to foreign exchange settlement, customs declaration, and transportation were recorded in the New York branch's current account. The branch only paid a 15% commission to the head office. All business and financial matters of the branch were never reported to the head office. This situation may lead to the following malpractices: 1. Concealing profits and evading national taxes; 2. Obscuring the true situation of business operations; 3. Without reporting or regular auditing of the branch's business in New York, it is impossible to know whether it is absorbing overseas remittances (see Attachment 13 for details).

Yangtze Construction Corporation: This company was registered and established in April 1946, with a capital of 100 million yuan in national currency. In July 1947, the capital was increased to 1 billion yuan, divided into 1 million shares. Kong Lingkan held 249,000 shares, Du Yuesheng held 7,000 shares, Fan Shaozeng and two others each held 6,000 shares, Zhao Jiyan and two others each held 90,000 shares, Gu Xinyi and four others each held 50,000 shares, Yao Wenkai held 48,000 shares, and Luo Qinghua and one other each held 4,000 shares. Kong Lingkan was the chairman of the board and general manager. There are nine departments, including industry, business, affairs, finance, agency, import, export, pigments, and film, as well as five branch offices in Hankou, Fuzhou, Nanjing, Hong Kong, and Tianjin. Its business scope includes industrial development, transportation, warehousing, insurance, real estate, domestic and foreign product sales, and industrial and commercial investment. An examination of its business operations reveals the following: 1. Regarding the use of foreign exchange, a total of US$1,820,411.03, £21,041, and 45,333.00 Swiss francs have been settled. There is also unsettled foreign exchange, including US$903,684.72 and £1,386. For export goods, a total of US$954,889.61, £95,562, and 266,035 Swiss francs have been settled. 2. The imported goods are mainly cotton and medicines. For automobiles, 50 Austin cars were purchased, which did not exceed the prescribed amount, and 182 boxes of cosmetics were imported successively under permit number MC22-28, with a total value of US$10,403.49. Among them, two boxes contained perfumes, powders, and other luxury goods, which were prohibited from being imported and were verified by customs and ordered to be returned, and were not allowed to be imported. 3. The company has 20 exclusive agency agreements with British and American manufacturers, the most of which are for medicines. 4. In addition to this company, there is also the American Yangtze Trading Corporation (Yangtze Lauding Corporation New York U.S.A.). According to its statement, it is only for business liaison and mutual sales of goods. Its organization and capital are independent and unrelated. The American Yangtze Trading Corporation entrusts the company to sell goods on its behalf, handles all procedures on its behalf, and charges a commission of 5% of the sales amount. If a transaction exceeds US$50,000, the commission is calculated at 2.5%. The same applies to the company's export goods entrusted to the American Yangtze Trading Corporation. However, the American Yangtze Trading Corporation's consignment goods are all applying for foreign exchange in the company's name. However, the above relationship does not have a formal contract (see Attachment 14 for details).

China Construction Bank: This company was founded in 1934 with a total capital of 10 million yuan in national currency, divided into 1 million shares. The majority of shareholders are local banks and leading bankers in Shanghai, totaling more than 80 shareholders. Those with more shares include Wu Weiqing (176,000 shares), Jia Yuesen and Li Ziming (30,000 shares each), Xi Demao (31,000 shares), Xu Keting, Kong Yuenzhi, and Ye Zhuotang (20,000 shares each), Song Ziwen, Zhang Renjie, Chen Qikang, and Bei Zuyi (25,000 shares each), Li Shufen (53,000 shares), and Song Zian (35,000 shares). Kong Xiangxi was the chairman of the board, and Song Zian was the general manager. Its affiliated units include four companies: Huainan Mining Railway, Yangtze Electric, Hanzhen Jiji Hydroelectric, and Sino-American Rubber. An examination of the company's situation reveals the following facts: 1. The company's foreign exchange settlement amounted to only US$877.62, used to purchase typewriters and miscellaneous stationery. 2. The company imported a total of 56 cars of various brands, with its own foreign exchange, and the factory prices did not exceed the regulations. 3. According to the company's report, the net loss for this period was 142,701,782.00 yuan in national currency. 4. Song Ziwen's share capital in the company only accounts for 250,000 yuan in national currency, accounting for one-fortieth of the total capital (see Attachment 15 for details).

China Vegetable Oil Factory: This factory was initiated and organized by the former Ministry of Industry in 1936, with a capital of 2 million yuan, subscribed by the Ministry of Industry and the governments of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces respectively, and it was decided to raise half of the capital from commercial shares. At the second shareholders' meeting in 1947, the capital was increased to 2 billion yuan in national currency. In addition to the old shareholders subscribing for 1.6 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications and the Farmers Bank each subscribed for 120 million yuan, and the remaining 160 million yuan was subscribed by the factory's employees. Government shares accounted for 58%, and commercial shares accounted for 42%. The chairman of the board was Zhou Yichun, and the general manager was Zhang Jiazhu. The main business is the export of tung oil and the extraction of edible oil. An examination of its business operations reveals the following: 1. Regarding loans, since the end of the war, the factory has transported and sold approximately 40,000 tons of tung oil and extracted over 10,000 tons of oil. Due to insufficient self-funding to support the turnover, after being ordered to increase capital to produce edible oil and stabilize commodity prices, it applied for loans from the Four Banks Joint Treasury. A total of 30.1 billion yuan has been approved and is being used, divided into tung oil loans of 22.5 billion yuan, edible oil production of 8.6 billion yuan, increased production and pre-purchase of peanut raw material loans of 18 billion yuan, and government pre-allocated subsidy for food oil sales to government and education employees of 1 billion yuan. 2. Regarding export foreign exchange settlement, the factory mainly exports tung oil. From January 1, 1946, to the end of August 1947, the export foreign exchange settlement was equivalent to US$30,038,504.01. The imports were all production equipment, such as oil tanks, oil barges, and cotton ginning equipment, totaling US$470,371.00, which is consistent with the numbers listed by the Central Bank. 3. Regarding the sale of edible oil, in order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures plan to stabilize oil prices, the factory jointly sold edible oil to retailers with the China Food Oil Company. In April of this year, oil prices fluctuated greatly. The Shanghai Municipal Government convened a meeting of representatives from various oil industries and decided to allocate 13,483.41 municipal dan of edible oil from the China Food Oil Company to the factory, of which 9,655 municipal dan were offered for sale at prices discussed by the municipal government to stabilize oil prices. These sales all had settlement receipts from each purchaser, and the sales prices were determined by the Shanghai Municipal Government (see Attachment 16 for details).

(G) Investigation of the use of diplomatic passports by representatives of Fuzhong and other companies to engage in

### Commercial Activities in the United States

Regarding the use of diplomatic passports by responsible personnel of Fuzhong and other companies to engage in commercial activities in the United States, the following facts have been verified:

Song Ziliang, the current general manager of China Fuzhong Company, obtained diplomatic passport No. D2067 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 3, 1940, and went abroad under the name of a special envoy sent by the Executive Yuan to the United States to investigate transportation. On September 14, 1946, he re-endorsed his passport to go to the United States and has not yet returned to the country (Attachment 17).

Shen Henian, the current assistant manager of China Fuzhong Company, obtained diplomatic passport No. D2435 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 20, 1942, in the name of a private secretary accompanying Zhu Jueqian, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and went abroad. On July 5, 1946, he re-endorsed his passport to go to the United States and has not yet returned to the country.

Song Zian, the current general manager of China Construction Bank, obtained diplomatic passport No. D2325 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 6, 1941, in the capacity of a staff secretary of the Military Affairs Commission, and went abroad. He is still in New York. (Continued on the fifth edition)

### Large-Scale Cabinet Reshuffle in Britain; Five Ministers Retire and Successors are Promoted

[Our Newspaper News] London, 7th Broadcast: The British Labour government, in power for two years, carried out the largest cabinet reshuffle tonight. Prime Minister Attlee asked five ministers to retire voluntarily, appointed four cabinet ministers, and promoted five ministers with less seniority.

### US Drafting Concrete Proposals on the Korean Issue, Will Consult with China and the UK First

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 7th Broadcast: Lake Success News, according to sources close to the US delegation, the United States has finally decided to submit the Korean issue to the United Nations General Assembly, approximately within this week. The United States will propose the establishment of an independent Korean government under the supervision of the United Nations in the coming months, with the aim of breaking the deadlock between the US and the Soviet Union on the Korean issue. The United States hopes that when the US and Soviet troops withdraw simultaneously, Korea itself and the United Nations will be responsible for maintaining order and supervising elections in the north, south, east and west of Korea to ensure they are absolutely free and democratic. US officials hope that the elections can be held within the next six months. As for the troop withdrawal issue, it should be discussed by Korea, the Soviet Union and the United States to determine a date. In this way, Korea's future will not depend on the four powers, but can be guided by the United Nations.

### UN Committee Debates Greek Issue, Soviet Union Rejects US Compromise Plan, Demands Foreign Troops Withdraw from Greece

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 6th] The United States previously proposed a compromise plan on the Balkans issue at the UN General Assembly, namely, if Greece's three northern neighbors and other United Nations countries agree to cooperate with the proposed Balkan border survey team, the United States is willing to abandon the accusations of the three countries. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky rejected the compromise plan of the United States on the 6th and further accused the United States of completely destroying Greek independence and turning Greece into a US military base.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 6th] Soviet representative Gromyko said in a speech at the UN Political Committee that Greece should be held fully responsible for the Balkan turmoil and demanded that foreign troops withdraw from Greece immediately. He said that after careful study of all the documents of the Balkan Investigation Committee, the Soviet delegation came to the following conclusions: (1) The facts prove that the accusations against the three countries of Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria are completely unfair and based on fabrications; (2) The facts prove that all guilt should be borne by the Greek government; (3) The government that engages in interference in Greece, supports anti-democratic and reactionary forces, and attempts to use the situation to achieve its own expansionist goals cannot shirk its responsibility; (4) The Soviet delegation cannot accept the US proposal to establish a new Balkan border monitoring committee because the proposal is based on false information. Gromyko said that if this resolution is adopted, it will be a new obstacle to promoting international peace and security. The Soviet Union believes that the only proper way to resolve the Greek issue is: First, immediately withdraw foreign troops and foreign experts stationed in Greece; Second, give the Greek people a real opportunity to resolve their own problems based on democratic principles.

### Discussions on the Disposition of Italian Colonies Encountered Obstacles at the Four-Power Conference; No Agreement Reached on the Qualification of Participating Countries

[United Press London 7th dispatch] The four-power foreign ministers' representatives encountered their first obstacle on Monday when discussing the future of the Italian colonies in Africa. The United States and the Soviet Union clashed on the number of countries with the right to attend and present their cases on this issue. The United States argued that only Allied countries that fought in North Africa and countries that demanded a share of Italian territory should be allowed to attend and present their cases. However, the Soviet representative, Mr. Tzarapkin, insisted that all 17 countries that signed the peace treaty with Italy, as well as countries that demanded Italian territory, should be allowed to attend and present their cases. The meeting adjourned without any results. However, the US representative, Mr. Koorman, promised to forward the Soviet proposal to the State Department for further consideration.

It is reported that the United States indicated last year that the Soviet proposal would place countries such as Ukraine and Yugoslavia on the same footing as Great Britain and its self-governing dominions, which had shed blood and made great contributions in the North African war, which the United States found difficult to accept. French Deputy Foreign Minister Massigli accepted the Soviet definition of "concerned countries" on the 6th, meaning that this term refers to countries that should participate in the conference to resolve the colonial issue under the provisions of the peace treaty with Italy. The British representative, Mr. Charles, put forward a third suggestion that the four powers decide on a deadline for each country to submit its opinions. However, the British explanation was to enable the Arab League countries to express their opinions. A spokesperson for the League has expressed the hope to express opinions on the proposal for Libya's independence. All four deputy foreign ministers agreed that Egypt and Abyssinia, having claimed Italian territory, should have the right to attend. The list of countries that the United States proposed to have the right to attend included Australia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia, Greece, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, and South Africa, whose troops had fought in Africa. The Soviet list would add Ukraine, Belarus, Yugoslavia, China, Canada, Brazil, and the Netherlands, as these countries also signed the peace treaty with Italy. US sources reported that Tzarapkin said that if the Soviet interpretation was accepted, the Soviet Union would oppose Pakistan's participation, as it was established after the signing of the treaty.

### Yu Zhengxun Summons Yu Xiaosheng; Wu Ping Denies Soliciting American Dollars; Ma Lai Accuses Que Li of Murder; Que Li Sits Aside Smiling, Saying Ma Is All Lies

[Reported by this newspaper] Que Li Aque, the English suspect in the Yu Shengxiao murder case, was tried for the third time at the Criminal Court No. 1 of the District Court at 1:30 pm yesterday. Judge Zhu Yuhuang and Prosecutor Ding Tongjun took their seats. After first questioning Que Li's name, age, nationality, occupation, etc., they ordered him to sit aside. Next, the coffee shop manager of the Bersillon Coffee Shop, Yan Guizhen, a short waiter, was summoned. Yan claimed to be from Ninghai, Zhejiang, residing at No. 1, Alley 85, Albert Road, and working as a waiter at Bersillon for one year and eight months. Most of the customers in the bar were foreigners, and Ma Lai was also a frequent guest. When asked if he knew Que Li, he said he did not. Yan continued, "A young girl accompanied Ma Lai four or five times. On August 1st, a foreigner came to the coffee shop at around 3 or 4 pm and left a note, asking me to give it to Ma Lai. At around 7 or 8 pm, Ma Lai came alone, and I gave him the note. After reading it, he tore it up and said he understood. Then he sat for about an hour before leaving." Then, Wu Ping (pictured), one of the "sister flowers" on the photo obtained from Ma Lai's place, a bar girl, was summoned to testify. Her sister, Wu Zhen, did not attend due to illness. Wu Ping was wearing a light blue cheongsam, a bright red long-sleeved velvet shirt, light makeup, sunglasses, and light yellow leather shoes. She was quite short. When she appeared in court, she was still chewing Wrigley's Spearmint gum and said, "I am from Shanghai, 19 years old. I met Ma Lai in July of this year. We often went to Bersillon, so we got to know each other. We met a total of five or six times." Judge Song asked, "What did you talk about when you met?" Wu replied, "The second time we met, Ma Lai said he wanted to marry me, but it was just a joke." Asked, "How did it start?" She answered, "During small talk, he said he was a short guy. I am also a short girl, everyone is short, let's get married, after this he did not mention it again, I also did not say to him that only with money can we get married. The last time I met him was on August 2nd, he said that on the 4th he would be going to Nanjing, and asked me to go eat on the 3rd. After that, he sat with another woman named Gao Meiying for two hours before leaving." Asked when and where she gave the photo to Ma Lai, Wu said that it was during the third time she met Ma, she showed it to him at Bersillon, he looked at it but did not return it. Questioned if she asked Ma for US$1,000 in order to get married, Wu said hastily, "No, no, it was Gao Meiying talking nonsense."

Ma Lai's friend Wu Ping, who was supposed to testify, was questioned by the defendant's defense lawyer (photo by this newspaper)

### Ma Lai's Account of the Bloody Incident

Reading the record up to this point, the court summoned Ma Lai, who was escorted by two American military police officers to the witness stand. After swearing an oath, he testified: "I came to Shanghai twice in May of this year, and on July 17th I was assigned to the Kyoto Hospital Station, and returned to Shanghai on the morning of August 1st at 10:30 am." Asked if he had spoken with a Luo Se in Kyoto about getting married in Shanghai, Ma replied, "Perhaps I said it." Then he described the situation on August 1st, saying, "I reported to the hospital in Shanghai in the morning, and someone there told me that someone had called several times looking for me, but had not left a name. At 2:30 pm I went to the New Lido bar and met Que Li, who said he had been looking for me all day. I asked him when he would return my money, and he said he had no money, only some property in Hongqiao, which he was preparing to sell to a Chinese person, asking me to be a middleman, and I could get a commission. At 3:30 pm I sat in his car to the Broadway Mansion, where I changed into plain clothes. After drinking some coffee, he gave me a brown felt hat. He drove the car, and I sat in the back, driving along the Bund. Yu Shengxiao got into the car here. Que Li introduced me to him, and then we drove along Linsen Middle Road towards Hongqiao. When we got to Qingpu Road, Que Li suddenly stopped the car, holding a gun and turning around, he told Yu to give him the gold bars. Yu just threw the gold bars towards the front seat when suddenly a gunshot was heard, and Yu fell on me. I pushed him back, and Que Li asked me to lie down", and then he used the gun handle to hit Yu's head. He continued to drive for a while, then stopped the car again and ordered me to drag Yu out, which I did. The car turned east. I asked Que to give me the handgun, and Que did so. After entering the city, I asked him why he did this, but he did not answer. I washed my hands in his bathroom and wiped the blood stains off my clothes and pants. Then we went to the racetrack together. He got out of the car, and I found a bullet cartridge on the left side of the front seat of the car. After that, we went to the Huizhong Hotel for a drink, and he sent me back to the Broadway Mansion to sleep. The next morning, he called me to the New Lido for a meal, but when I got there, he was not there. At 5 pm, I went to his house, and he was not there either. After a while he came, and later I asked him why he did this, and I was ready to turn myself in, and he blamed me for being wrong. I said that as long as you return my money, I don't care about anything else. Then he gave me US$110 and said he was willing to give me a gold bar, but I said no. I only left his house at around 6 pm."

### Questioning the Details of the Shooting

After Ma Lai finished his testimony, Judge Zhu asked again how many times the gun went off and whether the car stopped after the shot. Ma replied that the gun went off once and the car stopped. Asked which hand Que Li held the gun with, Ma said he could not be sure. Asked again, "When Que Li turned around, was his head turned to the left or right?" He replied, "Turned to the left." Asked, "How did Yu Shengxiao lie down?" He replied, "He slowly slid down, as if he was very tired, sitting. Que Li then got up and raised the gun and struck Yu's head heavily. Yu shouted, 'Don't kill me, I want to live.' Que Li asked me to drag Yu out of the car, and I dared not disobey." Asked, "What did you and Que Li say on the way back?" He replied, "I asked him why he did this, and he said that he was used to doing this when he was in the patrol room." Subsequently, he did not deny that he had taken Gao Meiying to the Broadway overnight on the night of August 1st, but said that he had not told Gao that he was going to marry Wu Ping.

### Que Li Smiles and Remains Calm

Finally, Que Li was asked again if he had heard Ma Lai's statement clearly and if he had any comments. Que Li remained calm and smiled, saying, "I heard it clearly, but most of what he said is a lie. I have nothing else to say today, I can only say that everything I said before is the truth." The court ordered Que Li to ask Ma Lai questions, but Que Li was unwilling, saying, "Please let my lawyer represent me." The defendant's defense attorney, Tang Huaiqun, represented Que Li and asked Ma Lai, "You said you did not want Wu Ping to marry you, so it seems that Wu Ping wanted to marry you, you are a handsome man, she had to marry you?" Ma replied, "Maybe it's possible, this is also very common." The court ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing, which was already at 5 pm.

Commander Xuan told a Central News Agency reporter, "People from all walks of life have gatherings during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but soldiers spend the festival in vain due to their duties. This meeting is to take advantage of the free time to allow all military and police personnel in Shanghai to have a gathering." At the beginning of the banquet, Xuan delivered a speech saying, "Everyone present is directly or indirectly responsible for the task of protecting Shanghai. This task is arduous and not easy to accomplish. Shanghai is the industrial and commercial center of the country, the lifeline of the economy. In terms of national defense, it is the outpost of coastal defense, so Shanghai must be consolidated and stable. For the past two years, everyone has worked hard in their duties. Although it is not entirely in line with ideals, it is still comforting to the central and local people." Xuan continued, "The overall situation is becoming more and more serious, and the responsibility of the control class is even heavier. We are not afraid of facing great difficulties because we are all alert and deeply believe that we have the strength to overcome all difficulties. Soldiers have been in a passive position in the past, but the founding father once told us: 'Military affairs are the original driving force of politics.' The reason for the slow progress of politics is that soldiers have not fulfilled their responsibilities. Therefore, today's vigilant soldiers should change from being passive to taking the initiative and truly become the original driving force of politics. Everyone at today's meeting should be vigilant about the current situation so that the communists can be wiped out as soon as possible and the country can be built soon," Shao Baichang, Commander of the Fortress, delivered a speech, followed by entertainment programs. The banquet proceeded in a pleasant atmosphere and ended at 2 pm.

### ### Social Relief Association – Suggests Implementing Work Relief Measures

[Our Dispatch] According to relevant sources, the number of refugees fleeing to Shanghai from disaster-stricken and war-torn areas in Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and northern Jiangsu provinces has already reached over 200,000, and large numbers are still arriving in an endless stream. Most of the refugees who have arrived in Shanghai have become beggars, begging for food during the day and sleeping on the streets at night; even those who are young and strong find it difficult to find work. How to carefully consider their needs, find ways to provide relief and resettlement, all depends on the government and people's organizations to establish practical connections, work together, actively mobilize local forces, and pre-plan for winter relief, so that disaster victims can temporarily obtain warmth and sustenance. At the same time, it is also necessary to appeal to the government to exert great effort and implement work relief measures, so that millions of disaster victims with the ability to work can make a living through their own labor, thereby ensuring the proper maintenance of social tranquility and order in this city. Yesterday, our reporter made a special visit to the Shanghai Social Relief Association to inquire about their opinions on work relief. Mr. Zhou Yingshi briefly answered as follows: Mr. Zhou said that regarding the implementation of work relief measures, in addition to referring to the government's post-disaster relief work relief implementation plan, the following matters should be noted:

The operating agency shall be the Shanghai Winter Relief Committee, which will invite the Public Works Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, the Municipal Council, and other relevant parties to form a "Work Relief Group" to be responsible for implementation. Matters such as surveying, designing, approving, training, and supervising work relief projects shall be handled by the Public Works Bureau in consultation with the Executive Yuan Relief Administration. The method of paying work relief wages should be based on the principles of meeting the needs of the refugees and local customs, such as issuing food, clothing, and daily necessities in lieu of cash. The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee will find ways to raise the aforementioned funds and materials, and the "Work Relief Group" will be responsible for distribution. The Municipal Public Works Bureau should give priority to employing disaster-stricken people in any construction projects it undertakes. At the same time, the "Work Relief Group" of the Winter Relief Committee should set up a "Labor Supply Station" to provide appropriate labor and necessary information at any time. The selection of work relief workers should be based on the following two points: (1) The scope and types of work relief should be considered in light of the circumstances and expanded as much as possible to accommodate refugees who need various types of work. (2) The "Work Relief Group" should supervise the "Labor Supply Station" to handle investigation, registration, and classification matters, and create a classified roster of refugees eligible for work relief and send it to the "Work Relief Group" for team formation and assignment to work relief sites. Work relief should avoid contracting as much as possible and be handled directly in principle, to prevent contractors from using relief materials to seek private gain. Surplus materials and equipment from the Executive Yuan Relief Administration that are suitable for work relief should be requested and allocated to the work relief agency as much as possible for full utilization. When the Winter Relief Committee concludes its work, the work relief agency should be transferred to the Shanghai Social Relief Association. Continue to be responsible for handling matters.

Wang Zhenxiong, the son of the victim, and Zhu, an investigator from the Xujiahui Sub-Bureau, were present as witnesses. The defendant was first brought forward, stating: On the night of the 23rd, I accompanied the Sub-Bureau Chief to the Hongqiao Theater to suppress a disturbance, but only maintained order on the road and did not enter the theater. When returning, I passed an old woman a dozen doors away from the theater, who said that her son had been arrested by the police. I said it didn't matter, he would be released. A dozen doors further, I was suddenly surrounded by more than ten people, who dragged me into a small alley and tore my clothes. They said, "We're going to strip you." For self-defense, I fired a shot into the air as a warning, and they scattered in a panic. I fled to the vicinity of the small garden and met brothers from the Sub-Bureau and Investigator Zhu, and immediately reported to Zhu that I had fired several shots due to nervousness. However, he flatly denied going to Wang Wanshun's house.

Next, Wang Zhenxiong, the son of the victim, testified: That night, I was studying at home until midnight and had not yet gone to bed. My father returned home very late and was eating supper downstairs. Around midnight, seven or eight plainclothes and uniformed police officers came and knocked on the door. Before we could open it, they broke it down. After entering, they didn't ask any questions and accused me of fighting outside. I said I hadn't gone out. Before I finished speaking, I was slapped and they tried to arrest me. My father stepped forward to reason with them, but Gu fired three shots at him, and he fell to the ground on the spot. Seeing that they had caused trouble, they all fled. I followed them to the small garden and saw Investigator Zhu, to whom I reported everything. Zhu asked Gu about it, and Gu admitted that he had fired several shots into the air. Investigator Zhu then sent the police to take Gu to the station and sent someone to investigate my house, where my father had already died. After questioning the witness Investigator Zhu, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for another hearing.

### "White in, Red Out" – Strange Letters Before the Election – Assassination Squad Discovered in Chengdu – Threatening the Municipal Government Secretary-General

[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 5th via air] The election of Chengdu Municipal Councilors this year. Recently, the Central Government issued an order extending the term of the current Municipal Council, so the Municipal Government stopped processing [the elections], causing a huge uproar.

### Central Government Designates Candidates Based on Merit First

He Yaozu Discusses Election Issues in Chengdu

[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 4th] On the eve of the general election, the election battle launched by Sichuan Province to strive for democratic constitutionalism has reached a mature stage. The Central Government specially dispatched He Yaozu, Sichuan Provincial Election Supervisor, to come to Chengdu from Beijing on the 25th of last month to guide the Sichuan election. On the 29th, he spoke to party members about "Establishing Democratic Style from the Election." After inspecting and guiding the election work, Mr. He expressed great satisfaction with the progress of this election in Sichuan.

Yesterday, he spoke in great detail to reporters about the election issues: This time I came to Sichuan to guide party members in their election campaigns for legislative representatives and national representatives. Sichuan's party organization has always been sound and there has been seamless cooperation. I believe that there will be no disputes due to the election. Regarding the designation of candidates, the Central Government has instructed that "merit first" should be the guiding principle. The highest principle of our party organization is democratic centralism. The election comrades are free to submit to the review of the party group guidance committee in their respective counties and cities, and then the Central Guidance Committee will make the decision, which is in line with the modern democratic spirit. Establishing the country by suppressing the rebellion is the only goal of our party's future revolution. It depends on the party members to be of one mind and one heart and to share the same boat. Comrades in our party must register and be reviewed according to law. Once the Central Government makes a final decision, they should absolutely obey and support it unanimously. If they continue to run for election without being registered or nominated by the Central Government, it will be a violation of party discipline, and the party will impose severe punishment. Sichuan compatriots have made outstanding achievements in the process of our party's revolution, especially in supporting the eight-year war of resistance. More than 3 million Sichuan soldiers fought in the north and south of the Yangtze River, contributing manpower and material resources to complete the final victory. Their achievements are unprecedented in history. The people's organization was established the earliest. This constitutional government must be able to establish a democratic style throughout the country. After presiding over the election meeting in Chengdu, Mr. He will go to various places to inspect and plans to return to Beijing after the Double Tenth Festival to report back.

### Chongqing Municipal Criminal Police Department Plans to Use Police Dogs to Eradicate Opium and Drugs

[Our Dispatch from Chongqing, 4th via air] The problems of opium and drugs have not yet been eliminated in the city of Chongqing. The criminal police department of the police bureau believes that it is difficult to identify the secret transportation of drugs by human power. The technical office has recently formulated a police dog application plan to thoroughly eradicate opium and drugs. The price of grain in Chongqing has recently soared (the price of rice is 290,000 yuan per stone). It is said that the price of grain in the nearby rice-producing areas is only slightly different from the price here, so grain merchants are more willing to transport grain to expensive areas for sale, which has caused a shortage of food sources in the city and the price of grain is increasing day by day. It is confirmed that the Grain Association once planned to ask the authorities to set up grain loans to curb the rising price. After the adjustment of the foreign exchange market price, the price of gasoline here suddenly increased from 1.5 million yuan per large barrel (53 gallons) to 2.2 million yuan overnight. It is also difficult for merchants and the military to purchase it, and only a small amount can be retailed for short-distance transportation. The fare for public buses in the urban area has increased to 1,500 yuan per ticket. Tang Yi, Director of the Chongqing Municipal Police Bureau, has been ordered to be transferred to serve as a Major General Counselor in the Ministry of National Defense. Shi Juemin, the newly appointed Director, is said to be coming to Chongqing in mid-month to assume his new post.

### Report from the Supervisory Yuan in Full (Continued from Page Two) Second Conclusion

Based on the above factual investigation, the members believe that the following points are worthy of attention:

A. Since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, domestic and international situations have changed. On the one hand, the country is facing reconstruction after the war, with a shortage of resources, economic exhaustion, and currency inflation. On the other hand, after the restoration of transportation and trade with various countries, foreign goods have poured in like a tide, forming a shocking import surplus. Therefore, the foreign exchange problem not only affects the domestic economic situation but also involves the government's fiscal and financial policies. At the beginning of the victory, our government believed that the people, after eight years of hardship, had abundant financial resources and purchased large quantities of foreign goods to supplement their enjoyment. At that time, the government, holding a large amount of gold and foreign exchange, also adopted an extremely free and laissez-faire policy regarding the influx of foreign goods. From August 34 to November 35, under this laissez-faire policy, the government's original reserves of six million ounces of gold and over nine hundred million US dollars were largely depleted. Not only was the currency system unable to be reformed and prices unable to be stabilized, but most of this large amount of gold and US dollars failed to be used for constructive purposes. In addition, the control of foreign exchange was initially lacking in a sound structure, with former President Song solely approving its use, resulting in much waste (see Section B of the first section of this report and the investigation report on the gold rush case in this hospital in the spring of this year). This is a major loss to the country, and former President Song cannot but bear considerable responsibility.

B. Since November 17th of last year, as foreign exchange gradually decreased and prices rose daily, and especially after the gold rush occurred in February of this year, shocking the whole country, revisions were made successively to the provisional measures for import and export trade and the emergency measures for the economy. The foreign exchange policy went from extreme freedom and laissez-faire to extreme control and contraction. In this extremely changing process, not only did the government's foreign exchange policy appear tense and chaotic, causing the market to be unable to stabilize and prices to continue to soar, but also due to the repeated changes in institutions and frequent amendments to laws and regulations, wealthy merchants were able to calmly manipulate speculation, while ordinary merchants suffered from not knowing what to do. In addition, general discussions and criticisms gradually alienated merchants from the government's measures, and the implementation of policies became increasingly difficult. Although the official foreign exchange rate was fixed at 1.20,000, the distance between the black market and the official rate widened day by day, resulting in all overseas remittances and private foreign exchange flowing into the black market in recent months, and income gradually disappearing. Therefore, there was no choice but to adopt a parallel floating method for foreign exchange market prices and official markets on August 17th. In the future, there should be a thorough and appropriate decision on the foreign exchange control institution and methods to avoid constantly changing orders, causing hardship to both the government and merchants.

C. After eight years of victory in the War of Resistance against Japan, and further exacerbated by the rampant communist bandits, our country's economy is exhausted, and the people are struggling to survive. The whole country, from top to bottom, is striving to complete the great cause of nation-building with a spirit of perseverance and struggle. Therefore, the central government recently issued a clear order to vigorously practice thrift. However, looking at the use of more than 500 million US dollars over the past year or so (excluding the sold gold), little has been used for construction, cultural education, and improving people's lives, while most has been used for consumption, such as cigarettes, tobacco leaves, canned food, fruit, and glassware, which is inevitably close to waste. In the future, under the principle of thrift, the government should expand the scope of prohibiting the import of non-daily necessities and non-construction products (i.e., expand the scope of items in Appendix 4 of the revised provisional measures for import and export). As for liquid fuels, their uses should also be strictly controlled to achieve the purpose of thrift, so as to avoid the current proliferation of private cars in major commercial ports such as Shanghai, wasting gasoline.

D. Since the implementation of stricter controls on import trade last year, foreign merchants in general have been quite dissatisfied. The reports from the Associated Press in March of this year and the New York Afternoon News in July are clear examples. After investigation by the members, these public opinions inevitably have the following two misunderstandings: Ignorance of the true situation, such as the aforementioned Associated Press and Rundall both criticizing the ban on the import of wireless generators and electric refrigerators as luxury goods, while the World Trade Corporation, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Materials Supply Bureau imported large quantities. Regardless of the quantity of such items imported by the above-mentioned state-run agencies, wireless generators and electric refrigerators have always been treated in accordance with the tariff regulations since the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan and have never been regarded as luxury goods and prohibited from import. Chinese and foreign merchants have the opportunity to obtain the import of such goods under certain legal application procedures. Exaggerated malicious propaganda: China has long been in a position of economic colony. In the past, foreign merchants in China had concessions and other privileges, and their trade in China was in an absolutely superior position. Most of our import and export merchants relied on their favor. After the victory, the government's control was slightly stricter in order to adapt to China's current economic environment, and state-owned business agencies inevitably had some advantages. Foreign merchants felt unprecedented inconvenience, so they made exaggerated propaganda and criticism. While the孚中 and other companies have their shortcomings and need to be corrected, they cannot be used as a pretext to slander our government, nor can it be said that they are using political and other pressure to push foreign merchants out of the Chinese market. Moreover, the British and American firms represented by孚中扬子 and other companies, their sales of goods are also the materials manufactured by British and American entrepreneurs, used to promote them in the Chinese market.

(Reported by this newspaper from Jiangyin on the 6th) The Wu family in Beisuo Lane in the city has always been known as a major drug den.

Forty-one small packets of white powder were found in the firewood and placed on the table. Sanmei took advantage of people's inattention and put them all into her mouth, attempting to commit suicide by swallowing the drugs. Director Yue held her mouth, and Sanmei bit off half an inch of his finger. Xiang Sanmei, Xu Xingbao, and Wang Zhengyao were all arrested and interrogated by the county.

### US Troops Demand Dancing, Qingdao Dance Halls Still Provide Escort

(United Press, Qingdao, 7th) The government is vigorously practicing thrift, stipulating that all dance halls must be closed by the end of September. However, major escort dance halls here are still operating as usual. According to city government officials, the dance halls have not stopped operating not because of opposition from the dance hall bosses or dance girls, but for the convenience of American soldiers. The city government has requested instructions from the central government and is awaiting a reply. In the past, the city government once decided to close all dance halls, and the American military authorities immediately requested that several be reserved for the use of American soldiers, which is impossible to exclude Chinese dancers.

### This Newspaper and Baoli Hospital Jointly Organize Obstetrical Assistance, Methods Similar to Renhe, Red Cross Society and Shangxian Hospitals

In February of this year, when this newspaper jointly organized the "Obstetrical Assistance for Poor Women" campaign with Renhe Hospital, the First Hospital of the Red Cross Society, and Shangxian Maternity and Children's Hospital, we respectfully declined the cooperation of many hospitals that were willing to cooperate with this newspaper, fearing at the time that manpower and material resources would be insufficient, but the spirit of service and the benevolent enthusiasm of these three hospitals are always engraved in our hearts.

Eight months have passed, and the "Obstetrical Assistance for Poor Women" campaign has provided assistance to more than 100 pregnant women, enabling them to receive scientific production care. Due to financial constraints, we cannot expand as much as possible. To remedy this shortcoming, Baoli Hospital has provided us with great assistance. In the past four months, they have generously provided assistance to some pregnant women who missed out. Yesterday, we received a letter from Baoli Hospital saying:

"To whom it may concern: Since our hospital has cooperated with your newspaper, it has rescued dozens of poor pregnant women. Now, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of your newspaper, we intend to jointly organize obstetrical assistance for poor women with your newspaper to show our humble service to society. We request your approval."

We are very honored to be able to obtain the replenishment of new forces, and we are also fortunate for countless poor pregnant women.

Starting today, obstetrical assistance for poor women has added a new force, and at the same time, we hope that this movement can be more widely promoted and carried forward.

### Letter from Zhabei Water and Electricity Company

It is found that the houses at No. 2, Hengfeng Lane, Sida Lane, Shanyin Road, had their own artesian wells to supply all water usage before the war. During the enemy occupation, the water pipes of the two lanes and the newly built Ziyuan Villa were connected to the company's tap water with a 100mm inlet pipe. After the war, the enemy returned, and the population of the two lanes has increased sharply. It is estimated that there are 1,244 faucets. According to the water supply regulations of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, for those who have a 100mm inlet pipe, the maximum number of internal faucets is limited to 200. Now, it exceeds more than six times, so it is inevitable that the water pressure on the second and third floors is difficult during the water consumption time of each household. The water pressure of the company's water supply pipe in that area is more than 45 feet even during the water consumption period, and there is no drop in pressure. Therefore, the method of improving the water supply in that area is to entrust a plumbing contractor to change the inlet pipe to a 150mm diameter pipe. After the installation is completed and reported to the company for inspection and approval, a 150mm diameter water meter can be replaced, and the water supply to each household can be improved. As for the water fee, the company collects it according to the price approved by the Public Works Bureau. We hope that you will publish this information to clarify the facts. This is addressed to the Social Service Editorial Department of Shen Bao. Zhabei Water and Electricity Co., Ltd.

Recently, he wants to transport the coffin back to his hometown for burial. I have inquired among relatives and friends, some say that they have never heard of "Gumei Villa," and some say that the villa was closed before the war of resistance, and the details after that are unknown. Therefore, I would like to inquire about the following three points: Where is the current depository of coffins of Gumei Villa? What is the mailing address? If it has already closed, how were the unclaimed coffins handled at the time of closure? Cremation or burial in place? If cremated or buried in place, where is the ash from the cremation or the grave from the burial? If any kind person knows of this villa, please find a way to inform me in detail, then not only will my friend be endlessly grateful, but the deceased will also deeply feel the kindness even in the afterlife! Sincerely, Bian Depei (Mailing address: No. 13, Meifu Lane, Huanghe Road (9))

Spring and Autumn

### The Story of an Old Shoemaker by John Galsworthy, Translated by Lin Fengzao

I knew him from when I was very young, because he made shoes for my father. He and his brother lived together on a small street, two small shops combined—gone now, but at the time, they held a fashionable position in London's West End.

The store's distinctiveness was its quietness. There was no sign on the shopfront proclaiming that they served royal families—only his own German name, "Gessler Brothers Shop"; several pairs of shoes were displayed in the window. I remember, I never understood why those same pairs of shoes were always in the window. He never made ready-made goods, only custom orders. If you were to say that his work didn't fit, it would seem inconceivable. Were those shoes bought to display there? That also seemed inconceivable. He would never put leather goods made by others in his own shop. Moreover, those shoes were truly beautiful; for example, the pair of patent leather dancing shoes, those indescribably slender shoes, with the finest leather matched with fabric, made one salivate; and the pair of tan high-topped riding boots, though brand new, carried a strange, somber color, as if they had been worn for a hundred years. Only someone who could see the soul of the shoes could make these leather shoes—truly the embodiment of the spirits of all shoes. Of course, these thoughts only came to me after I became an adult, but when I was having shoes made there—around the age of fourteen—I sensed a certain dignity in him and his brother. Because making shoes—the shoes he made—then and now, seemed to me a magical and incredible thing.

I remember very clearly that one day, as I was stretching out my small foot for him to measure, I said embarrassedly:

"Mr. Gessler, isn't making shoes very troublesome?"

From within his ironic red-blond mustache, a smile suddenly appeared, and he replied: "It is an art!"

He, with his yellow and wrinkled face, red and curly hair and beard, wrinkles evenly spread across his face slanting down to the corners of his mouth, and monotonous guttural voice, seemed somewhat made of leather; because leather is a thing of irony, tough and clumsy. His expression was like that, but in his pair of blue-gray eyes, the simple strength of an idealist was hidden. His brother was much like him—though in every aspect a little worse, and also diligent—therefore in my early years, I always had to wait until I had spoken to them to distinguish them clearly. If I heard, "I must ask my brother," it was his brother; if not, it was him.

When a person grows up, they become rude, running up debts everywhere, but in any case, they would never run up a debt at Gessler Brothers Shop. For example, if you owed him money for two pairs of shoes, and you ran back, extending your foot towards his blue eyes behind steel-rimmed glasses, indicating that you were still his patron—that didn't seem like a decent thing to do.

In reality, going to his place often was impossible—his shoes were too durable. They had a timeless quality—you could say that they had the essence of leather shoes sewn into them.

When someone goes to a shop, they always have this feeling: "Quick, get the things, let me leave!" But going to this shop had a different sense of quiet, like walking into a church; you had to sit on that one wooden chair and wait—because there was always no one there. After a short while, from the corner of the house—which was quite dark, and had the soft smell of leather, this was the shop—his brother's face appeared, looking down. Then there was a guttural sound, and the sound of wooden clogs descending the narrow wooden staircase. He came before you, not wearing an outer garment, his body somewhat hunched, wearing a leather apron, his sleeves rolled up, his eyes blinking—as if he had just woken up from a dream of leather shoes, or like an owl startled by the bright light of day, showing unease.

I would say: "Mr. Gessler, how are you? Would you make me a pair of Russian leather shoes?"

He would not say a word, returning to his original place, or walking to another part of the shop, and I, continuing to sit on the wooden chair and wait, smelling the scent of leather. After a while, he would return, a piece of golden-brown leather in his thin and veined hand, his eyes on the leather, saying: "Such beautiful leather!" I also chimed in with praise. He would ask: "When do you need them?" I would reply: "Ah! At your convenience, the sooner the better." He would say: "Two weeks, is that okay?" If it were his brother, he would say: "Let me ask my brother!"

Then I would softly say: "Thank you! Goodbye, Mr. Gessler." He would reply, "Goodbye"—but his eyes were still looking at the leather in his hand. As I walked towards the door, I heard the sound of wooden clogs, and he was walking up the stairs, returning to the dream of leather shoes. But if I wanted a new style of leather shoe that he had never made for me before, he would become cautious—he would take off my shoe, hold it in his hands for a long time, observing it carefully, criticizing it, but also showing affection, as if recalling the brilliance he had created, and blaming others for ruining this masterpiece. Then, he would put my foot on a piece of paper, drawing around the edge of my foot with a pencil repeatedly, and stroking my toes with his trembling fingers, empathizing with the center of my needs.

One day, I happened to say to him: "Mr. Gessler, you see, the last pair of everyday shoes squeaked." This day, I cannot forget.

Hearing my words, he looked at me, not answering for a long time, as if wanting me to retract or correct my words. Then he said:

"The shoes should not squeak."

"But, it really is like that."

"You must have carelessly gotten them wet?"

"I think not."

Hearing these words, his gaze lowered, as if trying to recall that pair of shoes. I felt very sorry that I had brought up this serious matter.

"Send the shoes back!" he said, "I will examine them carefully."

I felt sympathy for that pair of squeaking shoes. I could imagine him bending over, with a worried curiosity, taking great effort to inspect the shoes.

He slowly said: "Many shoes are born bad. If these shoes cannot be repaired, I will not charge you."

Once (only once), I was careless. I wore a pair of shoes bought from a large company to his shop. Those shoes were bought out of temporary necessity. Although he agreed to still make shoes for me, he did not show me the leather. I could feel his eyes fixed on my awkward shoe. Finally, he said:

"These are not my shoes."

The tone was not angry, nor sad, nor disgusted, but it carried a component of quietness that made your blood freeze. He reached out his hand, and pressed a finger on the left shoe, where it was stylishly made, but not very comfortable.

He said: "It's uncomfortable here. Those big companies have no self-respect. Truly awkward goods!" Then, as if something internal made him lose self-control, he said many harsh words. Only this once did I hear him talk about the situation and difficulties of his business.

He said: "They have taken all the business away. They rely on advertising, not on work. We love shoes, but they have taken the business away. It has now reached the point—I have no work to do. It gets worse every year, you watch." Looking at his face full of wrinkles, I saw something I had not noticed before, which was the difficult circumstances and the difficult struggle—suddenly I saw that many of his red whiskers had turned gray.

I tried to explain, I told him under what circumstances I had bought that unlucky pair of shoes. But his face and voice moved me deeply. So, in a few minutes, I ordered many pairs of leather shoes. But the goddess of revenge was at work. These shoes were more durable than anything else. For almost two years, I really didn't have to go back to his place to have shoes made.

Finally, I went to his shop. Strangely, I found that one of the two small window cabinets outside his shop had someone else's name written on it, another shoemaker's name—of course, he made shoes for the royal family. Those familiar shoes were no longer sparsely occupying a position of dignity, but were squeezed into a small window cabinet. The reduced small shop inside smelled heavier than before, and the light was dimmer than before. Moreover, the looking down, the sound of wooden clogs, came slower than before. Finally, he stood before me, looking at me through his rusted iron-rimmed glasses, and said: "...Mr., is it not? "Ah! Mr. Gessler," I stuttered, "You know, your shoes are really too good! Look, these shoes are still very decent!" I extended my foot to him. He looked at it.

"Yes," he said, "It seems like people generally don't want to wear good shoes anymore."

In order to escape his blaming eyes and voice, I hastily said: "How has your shop changed?"

He calmly replied: "Expenses are too high. Do you want to make shoes?"

Although I only needed two pairs of shoes, I ordered three pairs and quietly left. Although I didn't quite know, I always felt that he thought I was one of the people who were against him; perhaps not against him personally, but against his ideal of shoes. I thought, a person probably doesn't care much about this feeling; because, after several months, I went to patronize his shop again. I remember, I thought this: "Ah! Well, I can't ignore the old man—I'll go! Maybe I'll run into his brother!"

Because I knew that, in terms of his brother's character, he would not open his mouth to condemn, in fact, he wouldn't even have a closed mouth expression.

Arriving at the shop, I was relieved. It was his brother who came out, holding a piece of leather. "Ah, Mr. Gessler, how are you?" I said.

He came closer, gazing at me.

"I'm fine, but my brother is dead," he said slowly.

I knew it was him—but how old—I had never heard him mention his brother's name before, I was startled, and softly said: "Ah! How unfortunate!"

He replied: "Yes, he was a good man, he could make the best shoes, but he died." He touched the top of his head, his hair suddenly thinning a lot, becoming as sparse as his poor brother's. He told me how his brother died. "He lost the shop, he was always sad. Do you want shoes?" He held up the leather in his hand and said: "Such beautiful leather."

I ordered several pairs. They came after a long time—but were even better than before. They were simply indestructible. Not long after, I went abroad.

More than a year later, I returned to London. The first place I went was my old friend's shop. When I left, he looked like he was sixty years old, when I returned, he looked like he was seventy-five years old, poor, frail, and trembling. This time, he didn't recognize me.

I felt very sad, and said: "Ah! Mr. Gessler, the shoes you make are really good! Look, I have been wearing them almost all the time while I was abroad, and they are still not half old, are they?"

He looked at my shoes for a while—a pair of Russian leather shoes. His face seemed to regain its former stability. He put his hand on my shoe and said:

"Is it comfortable here? I remember, when I made this pair of shoes, it took a lot of effort."

I told him that the shoes were very comfortable.

He said: "Do you want more shoes? I can make them faster; I am very free now."

I replied: "Good, good! Any kind of shoes—all styles of shoes!"

"I want to make a new style. Your feet must have grown a little." He drew my foot shape for me, and touched my toes, the movements were very slow. Only once did he raise his head and look at me, he said;

"Did I tell you, my brother is dead?"

He became very frail, making one feel sad. I couldn't wait to leave him.

I had forgotten about the ordered shoes. But one night the shoes arrived, I opened the package, and lined up the four pairs of shoes. Then tried them on one by one. No faults at all. The style, size, width, and the quality of the leather, everything was good, these were the best shoes he had ever made for me. In the mouth of a pair of ordinary walking shoes, I found his bill. Although the price was the same as usual, I was very shocked. He never sent a bill before the end of the season. I rushed downstairs, signed a check, and immediately mailed it.

A week later, passing by this small street, I wanted to run to tell him how well the newly made shoes fit. I walked to the front of the shop, and couldn't find his name. The black patent leather slender dancing shoes, the fine leather fitted with leather tops, and the dark gray riding boots, were still in the window cabinet.

I walked in, feeling very uneasy. In these two small shops—which had been combined into one again—there was a young Englishman.

I asked: "Is Mr. Gessler at home?"

He looked at me, his eyes were strange, but showing goodwill.

He said: "Sir, he is not, not. But we would be very happy to take your order. We have taken over this shop. You must have seen our name on the storefront next door. We make shoes for many important people."

"Yes, yes," I said; "But Mr. Gessler?"

He replied: "Ah! He's dead." "Dead! I received the shoes he made for me last Wednesday!"

"Ah!" he said; "That's a shocking thing. The poor old man starved himself to death."

"Heavens!"

"The doctor said it was chronic starvation! You see, this is how he worked! He had to open the shop; but wouldn't let anyone touch his shoes. He accepted a business deal, it took a lot of time. People lost patience. So the patrons all ran away. But he still sat there, working non-stop—I would like to say a fair word for him—no one in London could make better shoes than him! Just look at the people competing with him! He never advertised! He had to use the best leather, and do it himself. Ah, this is the result. He had his ideas, see what can be done?"

"But, starvation..."

"As people say, I may be exaggerating a little—but I know personally, he was still making his shoes day and night until the end. I often watched him. He never had time to eat properly; never kept a copper in the house. All his money was spent on leather and rent. I simply can't understand how he was able to live for so many years. He often ran out of food. He was really a character. But he made very good shoes."

"Yes," I said, "He made very good shoes."

I turned around and walked out immediately, because I didn't want the young man to know that my eyes were filled with tears, almost unable to see.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Not to mention the roundness of Tianjin people, even ordinary people experienced in the ways of the world, in this situation of national subjugation, would be unwilling to utter the naked description of "spy dog" to a stranger. Yaoqun naturally felt a little surprised; she hadn't expected that the information she wanted to inquire about would be so effortless to obtain, a complete success. She had never thought that Tianjin, which had fallen into enemy hands, would dare to blurt out such taboo words; not to mention patriotic words, it at least proved their hatred of the enemy. This reminded Yaoqun of the saying "Yan and Zhao have many generous and tragic scholars," Tianjin people are sometimes extremely bold; if they get angry. At the same time, the underground work in this area is also quite effective, so the people's spirit is still very strong.

From the mouths of these two greeters, Yaoqun learned that this transvestite Mai Shafu had arrived in Tianjin before and after the July 7th Incident, and had been working as a detective dog, wandering back and forth in upper, middle, and lower class hotels; sometimes when he got excited, he would put on a military uniform and riding breeches, and call some prostitutes to accompany him to drink.

"But not necessarily"; finally, the two greeters told Yaoqun: "Just two days ago, the Japanese devils came to arrest people—two secret agents of our government—but she let them go. We don't quite understand what this guy is up to."

As soon as Yaoqun returned to room number twenty-seven, this transvestite Mai Shafu followed closely behind. Starting off, he gave Yaoqun a frontal assault:

"Miss Ji, let's 'open the skylight and speak frankly,' it goes without saying that there must be a mission. Can you be frank and disclose your goal: Are you simply dispatched to collect case information? Or are you here specifically to take on liaison work, preparing to organize students and young people? Or did you bring a way to rescue those comrades?—You know, the day before yesterday at midnight, a total of two underground radio stations were broken up, and seven or eight comrades were arrested!"

If you were Yaoqun, putting yourself in her shoes, how would you parry this sudden frontal assault from Mai Shafu? At the same time, he had so accurately uncovered most of Yaoqun's background; if you were in that situation, how would you deal with it? If you stuttered, saying half and implying half, that would show that you don't have enough material, and this guy would laugh his head off. What if you completely denied it? That would not only fail to deny it, but also show that you are a novice "tenderfoot." You would simply be looked down upon. You must know that this guy is very resourceful. Unless he has seized the handle, he would never dare to be so rash and come to Yaoqun for a public negotiation like this face to face; therefore, even if you deny it, you cannot deny it. Yaoqun is proud and arrogant, would she be willing to use this inferior tactic and become a laughing stock in front of a strong enemy?

So, how would you deal with it? Is it possible to be more of a rogue, patting your chest: "I, your father, don't change my name, I don't change my surname..." Risking eating a set of Jianghu (underworld) rules, admitting frankly in one breath: "I am doing this"; then, if it goes well, we can join hands and make friends; if the talk breaks down, of course, we will each show our skills and fight to the death?
