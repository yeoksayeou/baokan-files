### Report by the Deputy Minister of National Defense on Military Affairs: Shandong Battlefield Expected to End Soon; Shouguang, Juancheng, and Juye Recaptured in Succession

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The situation on the Shandong battlefield is improving. Liu Shi-yi, Deputy Minister of National Defense, stated optimistically during a briefing to the Executive Yuan this morning: The war in Shandong is expected to come to an end soon. He said that the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng's forces, under pressure from the National Army, have been trapped in the triangular area south of the Yellow River and west of the Jinpu Railway. The Chen Yi bandit forces have also been separated from them to the east of the Jinpu Railway by the National Army. Two columns of Chen's forces attempted to cross the railway to the west to join Liu's forces, but they have been surrounded by the National Army. This situation is quite good. If there are no unexpected events, the war in Shandong is expected to conclude in the short term. Tan Boyu, the Deputy Minister of Transportation, followed Liu's report with a description of the transportation situation, stating that the Ministry of Transportation is focusing on the repair of railways and highways. Regarding the Jiaoji Railway, it has been opened several times in the past, only to be destroyed again. Therefore, the Ministry has decided to temporarily postpone repairs until the situation in Shandong becomes clear and the war comes to an end.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 8th] A major campaign to annihilate the enemy in western Shandong will resume within days. Liu Bocheng's main force and remnants of Chen Yi's main force are currently surrounded by the National Army in the area south of the Yellow River, west of the Grand Canal, and on both banks of the Songjiang River. Except for a portion that crossed the river and fled north, the remaining Communist bandits are finding it difficult to cross the river because Dongkou is firmly held by the National Army. They will be gradually annihilated in western Shandong. Furthermore, the National Army's security forces crossed the river at 5:00 AM this morning and launched a direct attack on Shouguang, overcoming resistance along the way. They recaptured Shouguang County at 9:00 AM and are currently conducting mopping-up operations in the outer areas.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 8th] The left-wing corps of the National Army completely occupied Juancheng on the 7th. Another National Army unit from Hebei also formally captured Juye on the morning of the 8th and is currently attacking Yuncheng from both sides. They are also controlling important points and lines between Jiaxiang, Juye, Yuncheng, and Juancheng, closing the southern gateway of this triangular area and forcing the remaining bandits to retreat and gather in the designated area for annihilation.

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 8th] The National Army in Yidu is advancing north, reaching west of Shouguang City, and launching a campaign to seize the city. The National Army in Jiaoxian continues to attack Gaomi. Zichuan and Boshan are also expected to be recovered soon.

The Wangfu Guards and banner affairs are being handled on his behalf by his younger brother Zhamusenzhabu, who is deploying defenses at the Maonaohai Temple. Xue Peiyin and Qi Quanxi, dispatched by the Provincial Government and the Mongolian Political Council to Otog Banner to mediate internal disputes, have arrived at Taolijia. Currently, the bandit Wang Zhen's forces in Anbian are actively preparing to attack north and are attempting to cut off the Sui-Ning transportation route.

### Constitutional Assembly Members Hold a Symposium to Discuss Practical Issues of Universal Suffrage, Raising Three Points for Government Attention

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] According to the National Assembly Liaison Association, a group of members of the Constitutional Promotion Association remaining in Nanjing initiated a constitutional symposium, which was held at the Chengxian Street Guesthouse at 7:00 PM on the 6th. More than fifty people attended, including Guo Heng, Duan Binglin, Chen Shichang, Song Dongdai, Zhao Zhenzhou, Shen Lingxiu, Guo Anyu, Wang Guangqing, You Hengxiang, Li Zhengtao, Zhou Yintang, Cui Chengzhu, Lai Weiying, Chen Yizhong, Huang Shaomei, Duan Jianmin, Zhao Qingyu, Luo Shaohui, Wang Pixu, Ding Xuanxiao, Shi Qigui, Leng Gangfeng, Su Xianyang, Dai Tianqiu, and Legislative and Supervisory Yuan members Tong Tianxiang and Zhang Lu. They expressed their views on the issue of universal suffrage this year: (1) The Legislative Yuan's determination of the number of legislators from each province and city is based on the highest population figures reported by each province and city between the 16th and 25th years of the Republic, using pre-war figures as the basis for post-war elections. This is actually inaccurate and will inevitably lead to many problems. Taking Sichuan as an example, the population reported in the 25th year of the Republic was more than 51.1 million, while the current reported population is more than 41.1 million, a difference of more than 10 million people. If the Legislative Yuan uses the population figure from the 25th year of the Republic as the basis for determining the number of legislators to be elected, there will actually be more than 10 million surplus votes in the future. What will be done with them? (2) In the northeastern and northern provinces, there are a total of twenty-two provinces and cities that are occupied or disturbed by Communist bandits. If alternative methods are used in these areas, such as selection or designation, it would be a clear violation of the law and a deprivation of the voters' rights. It would be even more difficult to meet the requirement of two-thirds of the total number in Article 8 of the preparatory procedures. What will be done? (3) Regarding the issue of proportional distribution of seats among political parties, although each party avoids discussing it in detail, it is a fact that in preliminary discussions, it is very likely that it will be done in a controlled and monopolistic manner, dividing public opinion and violating democracy, which will inevitably be opposed by the people. If it is not controlled, it will be difficult for small parties to emerge, and they may threaten to withdraw from the government. There was much discussion on the above three difficult issues, but no conclusion was reached. In addition, currently, there are man-made disasters in the north and natural disasters in the south, and the people are suffering and displaced. It is difficult to save the dying, and conscription of soldiers and grain is compounded by the collection of "votes." It is not difficult to imagine how interested they are in the election. Furthermore, at a time when the whole country is being mobilized to suppress the rebellion, if soldiers participate in the election, the front lines will be weakened; if they do not participate, their rights will be deprived. Whether various election matters, such as security, can be handled properly in the short term cannot be achieved with just a piece of paper. In short, this general election is the beginning of a century of constitutional government. The above-mentioned difficulties must be effectively resolved and cannot be compromised or handled carelessly. Therefore, the participants unanimously agreed that the government should face the actual facts, respect public opinion, and handle the elections carefully.

### Provincial and Municipal Election Committees to be Established Before August 20th

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The General Election Office held a committee meeting at 4:00 PM on the 8th and decided that all provincial and municipal election committees across the country must be established before August 20th. The attendees at today's meeting were Zhang Lisheng, Liu Dongyan, Jiang Yun, Jin Tigan, Wang Bin, and others, totaling seven people. Hong Lanyou was absent. The resolutions were: (1) The candidates for members of the Legislative Yuan constituency election offices may be proposed by the provincial election offices and submitted to the General Election Office for approval and appointment. The candidates for members of the National Assembly election offices in each county, city, and equivalent district may be recommended by the respective provincial election offices and submitted for approval and appointment. However, the decision on the above candidates shall be approved by the provincial election committee before being recommended. (2) Some provinces and cities, such as Gansu and Shanghai, have requested that citizen identification cards be used in place of election certificates. However, the issuance of election certificates is a mandatory requirement of the election law and cannot be changed. (3) Sun Banghua is appointed as the chairman of the Overseas Chinese Election Office in Santiago. (4) Voters who cannot write may ask someone to write for them at the polling place and affix their private seal or right thumbprint to show their seriousness. It is not necessary to establish a separate scribe for this purpose at the election office in charge. (5) The Supervisory Yuan requested clarification on "whether personnel who have served in public office and have engaged in corruption, and have been impeached according to law and sent for disciplinary action and trial, or whose whereabouts are unknown after summons for detention, have the right to vote and stand for election." The resolution was: "All those who do not meet one of the negative conditions stipulated by the election law shall have the right to vote and stand for election in accordance with the law. As to whether they can exercise it, let it take its course." (6) Each municipal election committee across the country must be established before August 20th, convene meetings in accordance with the law, and recommend candidates for members of election offices at all levels to the General Election Office by telegram for approval and appointment.

### The Two Factions of the Democratic Socialist Party Split, Wu Xianzhang Still Attempts to Dissuade

Saying He Does Not Approve of Li Daming's Telegram

[Our Newspaper Report] Since the Democratic Constitutionalist Party's Jinshan Headquarters formally announced its secession from the Democratic Socialist Party, the reporter specifically visited Wu Xianzhang to ask whether he agreed with this decision. Wu said, "The main reason why overseas party members made this decision was because my mediation within the Democratic Socialist Party failed. Li Daming sent a telegram to Zhang Junmai and me on August 1st, and also telegraphed the government. I do not approve of this, so I have sent a telegram to dissuade him. At the full congress on August 15th, I advocate that it be convened in the name of the Democratic Socialist Party, and not in the name of the Overseas General Branch and the Reformists. I have no opposition to Mr. Junmai personally, but I am dissatisfied with the people controlling him from the left and right. If Mr. Zhang can accept my mediation plan, the internal strife of the Democratic Socialist Party can still be eliminated. If he does not accept it, then further measures are still under consideration. I do not intend to participate in the full congress on August 15th, and the overseas branch will send other representatives to attend. The publication of the joint statement was slightly premature. As for the point of acting chairman, it is still under consideration. As for Mr. Zhang Dongsun, I believe that after the full congress, he will be able to participate in the Democratic Socialist Party jointly formed by overseas representatives and the Reformists."

### Ambassador Gu Talks to Reporters: The Peace Conference Should Be Held in Our Country

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, met with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Yamer today and exchanged views on the situations in Indonesia and Korea. Afterwards, reporters asked Mr. Gu about China's response to the U.S. proposal to convene a preliminary meeting for the Japanese peace treaty. He said: He did not discuss this issue during today's meeting, but explained that China generally agrees with the U.S. proposal. Mr. Gu said: China welcomes the proposal to convene a conference of eleven nations for the Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible and does not object to holding the preliminary meeting in Washington or San Francisco, but China hopes that the formal conference will be held in China. Mr. Gu said: Chinese and American experts are currently studying the liquidation of Chinese Lend-Lease accounts, with the aim of establishing negotiations on specific projects in the future. Mr. Gu refused to make any official statement on China's position on the voting procedures. It is understood that China has some opinions on the proposed voting procedures, namely, the two-thirds majority voting method advocated by the United States. China can accept this, but it must include the consent of three of the four major powers in the conference. This is to prevent a single country from using the veto power. It is also understood that this proposal is not a formal proposal, but only a suggestion under study. China itself is not bound by it. If this proposal is not accepted, China reserves the right to reconsider it.

### Resources Plundered from Us are Piled Up in Tokyo; Negotiations for Their Return Have Not Yet Yielded Results

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Resources plundered by Japan from various countries during the war are currently piled up in four major warehouses in Tokyo, regardless of category, and are being held in custody by the U.S. military. There are many types of resources, including factory machinery, jewelry, furniture, and antiques, most of which were looted from China, and a small portion from Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Our delegation to Japan has repeatedly requested the Allied Headquarters to return them, but the other party requires two documents: (1) proof of ownership, and (2) proof that they were looted by the enemy. The Allied Headquarters insists on following the European example, because when the German army moved the resources of the occupied countries, they issued receipts. If Japan is required to adopt the same method, it is not without difficulties in reality. Recently, MacArthur intends to sell these resources publicly in Japan, using the proceeds as Japan's export fund. Our country is currently working hard to oppose this in Washington and argues that the Philippines and Southeast Asian countries should first be allowed to reclaim the looted resources based on appropriate evidence, and that the remaining resources should be shipped to Shanghai where private individuals can reclaim the looted items based on proof, and the remainder should be auctioned publicly on the market, with the proceeds going to the government. As of now, negotiations have not yet yielded results.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Minister of Trade of the Economic Stabilization Headquarters, Zezawa, stated today in the House of Representatives Business Committee that the Japanese government's Trade Bureau will purchase export goods from manufacturers at high prices to encourage the production of export goods.

Also, Japanese importers were ordered today that if they enter into contracts with foreign companies without the approval of the Allied Headquarters, they will be severely punished.

### Relevant Parties Discuss Details of Smuggling; Southern China is the Most Rampant

[Our Newspaper Report] In order to understand the details of smuggling in various regions of our country, the reporter specifically visited relevant parties, who kindly provided the following answers: (1) Southern China—This is the region with the most rampant smuggling in the country. Smuggled items include cigarettes, dyes, flour, milk, kerosene, western medicine, cosmetics, rayon, gauze, cigarette paper, etc. The smuggling methods include sneaking, using United Relief Association relief material ships, and armed smuggling. All these smuggling activities are centered on Hong Kong and Macau. Relevant parties have concentrated patrol ships and land forces outside the two places to surround them. However, due to the vastness of the sea, our side cannot completely control it, and because the weapons and equipment are insufficient, it has not been fully effective in the past. Personnel and equipment are currently being strengthened. (2) Taiwan Region—Recently, a lot of Japanese goods and Korean goods have flowed into Taiwan by smuggling. Smuggled goods are mostly seafood, because although Taiwan itself is an island, high-end seafood such as shark fins and sea cucumbers are not produced there. There is also some sugar smuggled from Taiwan to Japan, but the amount is small. Recently, many smuggling incidents have been uncovered on the waters around Taiwan. Relevant parties attach great importance to this and have sent ships to patrol the Taiwan Strait; however, it has been ascertained that the smuggling in Taiwan is a large-scale, organized operation, and only by the concerted efforts of various agencies can it be effectively eradicated. (3) North China Region—In the past, there was a period when smuggling was very rampant. In particular, Andong and Korea are only separated by a strip of water, making it the main channel for smuggling. Since the abandonment of Andong, the situation in that area has been unclear. Since the government ordered the blockade of the ports of North China, there have been fewer opportunities for smuggling. As for the rumors of Japanese goods being smuggled into North China recently, Shanghai has not received any reports. Before a Sino-Japanese peace treaty is signed, Japanese cargo ships cannot enter our country's ports, so large-scale smuggling is impossible. (4) There is also small-scale smuggling in Hainan Island, with goods coming from Vietnam, mostly cloth. Relevant parties predict that after Sino-Japanese trade resumes, the smuggling of Japanese goods in Taiwan and North China will be inevitable, because Japan has sufficient goods and ships for export, and their prices are low, which is also welcomed by spenders. At the same time, the highly acclaimed Korean ginseng is feared that it will still be a popular smuggled item. Furthermore, the purpose of some smuggled goods is not to evade customs duties, but is caused by the fact that our country's import quotas are too strict and cannot meet the needs of industry and commerce. Therefore, eradicating smuggling is also related to the government's economic policies. As for export smuggling, the purpose is to evade foreign exchange settlement, because the official exchange rate is too far from the black market.

### Republican Congressman Judd Criticizes U.S. Far East Policy; Young Calls for Foreign Aid to Our Country

[Headquarters News] San Francisco, August 8 Broadcasting: Republican Congressman Judd delivered a speech at the closing session of the Third World Congress of Jesuits, criticizing the U.S. foreign policy in recent years, especially its policy toward the Far East. He said: China's greatest expectation in the War of Resistance Against Japan was to retain the land in the Northeast. After Japan attacked the United States, China could have allied with Japan at any time, resulting in the sacrifice of at least 100,000 more American lives, but the United States gave away the main seaports and railways in the Northeast to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference as a reward.

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 7th] Former financial advisor to the Chinese government, Young, delivered a speech in the Los Angeles City Council, summarizing his impressions of the current situation in China, saying: A comprehensive plan of aid to China similar in nature to the Marshall Plan for Europe will be very important at an appropriate time. At the same time, it is imperative to take gradual steps and provide foreign aid to China so that China will not disintegrate after ten years of suffering and hardship. Young explained the Chinese Communist Party, saying: The CCP may establish a regime, and this regime will be ruled by the Soviet Union.

The advisors attended a symposium with leaders from all sectors in Shandong Province, gathering political, economic, construction, and security information.

[Our Jinan Office, 8th] Wei's special envoy's press advisor, Watson, answered questions from the Jinan press on the morning of the 8th: (1) He obtained a lot of new information during the past week in North and Northeast China.

### Provisional Executive Yuan Resolves to Provide Relief for the Famine in Communist-Affected Areas of North China; 3 Billion Yuan Allocated to Each of the Four Provinces: Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong; Disaster Relief Lottery Tickets for Guangdong and Guangxi Not to Be Issued

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The funds required for the addition of four security teams in Jiangsu Province were approved by the Provisional Executive Yuan on the 8th, totaling 9.102 billion yuan. In addition, the disaster caused by the communist bandits and the drought in the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong have been received, and it has been decided to allocate 3 billion yuan to each province for relief.

[Another dispatch] The method of saving consumption, which was proposed in coordination with the national policy of general mobilization in wartime, was discussed at the Provisional Political Affairs Meeting of the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 8th. In principle, all members expressed their support, but because the original method was too rigid, obstacles were bound to be encountered during implementation. It was decided to appoint Wang Yunwu, Zhu Jiahe, Zhang Lisheng, Yu Hongjun, Gu Zhenggang, Lei Zhen, and Gan Naiguang as a seven-member review group to be responsible for the review. The small group met at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to study the original method in detail. Finally, Wang Yunwu was asked to summarize the opinions of the members, organize them, and submit them to the Yuan meeting for discussion.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The flood disasters in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces are severe. People from those provinces in Nanjing suggested to the Executive Yuan that disaster relief lottery tickets be issued to provide relief to the disaster victims. This was submitted for discussion at the fourth provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan today. The political committees all believed that the issuance of such lottery tickets would cause more harm than good, and would only increase the speculative mentality of the general public, and would still not allow the wealth held by the rich to be directed towards disaster relief, which would not help the matter in any way, and they all expressed their opposition. President Zhang repeatedly solicited the opinions of the members, and no one agreed, so it was decided not to issue them.

[Another dispatch] The fourth provisional meeting of the Executive Yuan was held at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 8th, chaired by President Zhang. The resolutions on various cases are selected as follows:

Matters for discussion (1) The case of the method of collecting disaster relief funds for the communist bandit and drought disasters in the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong was resolved and passed. (2) The case of Yu Zailin, Director of the Beixing Coal Mine Engineering Office, was resolved to grant a special pension of 20 million yuan and to request the National Government to issue a commendation order. (3) The case of the funding for the addition of four security corps in Jiangsu Province was resolved and passed. (4) The case of repaying the U.S. dollar compensation coupons for the grain purchased in advance by the two provinces of Yunnan and Shanxi in the 31st year was resolved to be repaid once in legal tender at the current exchange rate.

Appointments and dismissals (1) Zou Bingwen was appointed as the alternate to the delegation of our country to the third annual meeting of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Liu Xing was appointed as the deputy representative, Xie Jiasheng was appointed as the consultant, and Wang Liwo was appointed as the secretary and specialist.

### To Relieve National Economic Difficulties, the Wealthy Should Contribute; Wu Chunwu and Others' Opinions on Levying Property Donations

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] When the Economic Stabilization Council met on the 7th to discuss the levy of property donations, it was decided that it was difficult to handle this matter and that the procedures needed to be studied in detail, and it was resolved that an expanded symposium would be jointly held by the Legislative Yuan, the National Political Council, and other institutions to discuss it together. On the 8th, reporters separately interviewed Councilors Wu Chunwu and Yin Shuxian. Wu Zhaoxu. Zhang Qianhua and legislators Liu Butong and Tan Tiwu to inquire about their opinions on the levy of property donations. Combining their views, they all believed that the national economic situation was so difficult that the wealthy should take the "those who have wealth should contribute" approach, and actively contribute, and set an example for the world. They disagreed with the Economic Stabilization Council's original proposal to universally levy donations on the wealthy with more than 1 billion yuan. If this donation is implemented universally, the middle and lower classes will be disturbed, and the truly wealthy will be able to avoid it, which would be contrary to the original intention of creating this donation.

Wu Chunwu

Pointed out that if the government can start with the big households, it can not only make up for the financial deficit but also regain people's hearts. The current phenomenon is that the levies, loans, and requisitions are all borne by the poor, which is unfair. The key to suppressing the rebels is to gain the support of the people, and starting with the wealthy households is the best way.

Zhang Qianhua

Advocates selecting one or two wealthy people to levy. When asked by reporters that this matter has no legal basis, Zhang said that during the Anti-Japanese War, a decree was used to confiscate 40% of gold deposits. Why can't we use the same method to deal with the wealthy today? He believes that the situation has reached this point, and we must not tolerate it any longer.

Yin Shuxian

He believes that if it is to cooperate with mobilization, it is appropriate to start with the wealthy, but if it is for permanent construction, property should be universally collected. He believes that the urgent task is how to cooperate with mobilization, because it is enough to levy on a small number of wealthy people, and there is no need to disturb the people any more. The so-called cannon

Wu Zhaolie

He believes that the world is full of people who are doing this. If we start with the wealthy to levy donations, we should ensure that there is no leakage. All the wealthy people recognized by the Chinese people should be on the list of donations. This matter should be formulated as a special law with a revolutionary nature so that the wealthy have no way to escape. Wu also suggested a simpler and easier method. The government should clearly announce private deposits in the United States and requisition them. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has made a suggestion and can further negotiate with the U.S. through diplomatic channels.

Liu Butong

He believes that universally levying property donations will hinder the implementation. He pointed out that the movable and immovable property of the truly wealthy cannot be found, and their bank deposits cannot be found. He shouted a novel slogan, that is, the wealthy should restore the lives before the 16th year of the Republic of China, because the wealthy with billions of assets at that time mostly lived in pavilions. Liu also pointed out that Emperor Wu of Han implemented the wealth law, and there are many such examples in history. If donations are only levied from ordinary wealthy households with more than 1 billion yuan in assets, the result will inevitably be to oppress the people, and the truly wealthy will be able to get away with it.

### The Area of Shenyang Urban District is Designated as 400 Square Kilometers

### Foreign Exchange Expenses of Various Institutions Cannot Be Purchased Without Approval

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] The Executive Yuan stipulates that the foreign exchange expenses of various institutions must be approved by the Yuan before they can be purchased. However, a small number of institutions occasionally send personnel abroad or order materials from abroad without approval, and then apply for foreign exchange settlement afterwards, which is inappropriate. The Executive Yuan now specifically stipulates that personnel are not allowed to be sent abroad or materials that require the use of foreign exchange are not allowed to be purchased before approval.

### Editorial: Urgently Plan to Rescue the Flood Disaster in Northern Jiangsu

Has northern Jiangsu been quiet for several months? Recently, another flood disaster occurred, and the disaster is serious. According to our newspaper's telegram: The cause of this flood disaster in northern Jiangsu was first that heavy rains washed away the rivers, and the Yishui River and Shushui River flooded, causing the counties belonging to Xu, Hai, and Huai to be flooded, and the disaster area reached one or twenty counties, and is still flooding. According to Wang Binxuan, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, who reported to the press on the 4th: As of now, more than 10 million mu of farmland have been flooded, and it is estimated that there are more than one million disaster victims who have lost their homes. The county with the most severe disaster is Pizhou County. The four townships of the county have become a vast ocean, and the drowned people and animals are drifting everywhere, which is unbearable to witness. Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, sadly pointed out on the 5th that Jiangsu Province has had many misfortunes in recent years. Stability was reported last year, but now there is news of floods. The disaster is serious and the autumn harvest is hopeless, which is a major hidden worry. The Yellow River and Huai River are continuing to rise. If the flooding continues, all 36 counties in northern Jiangsu will become a swamp. It is unthinkable if rescue is not urgently planned. Looking at the current situation of the disaster, looking back at the past with scars everywhere, major disasters, and disastrous years, the calamity in northern Jiangsu is no less severe than the disasters in Guangdong and Guangxi; in terms of hidden dangers, it seems to be even more severe than in Guangdong and Guangxi. I hope that the government authorities and social figures will urgently plan to rescue it!

Northern Jiangsu is located in the northern part of Jiangsu Province, containing the area north and south of the Huai River, and the area belonging to Xu, Hai, and Huai. There are now 36 counties under its jurisdiction; its location is bounded by the Yellow Sea in the east, the Yangtze River in the south, northern Anhui and eastern Henan in the west, and the Jinpu Line in the north, close to Shandong. Its landform used to be the old course of the Yellow River. Since the Yellow River moved south in the Yuan Dynasty and usurped the Huai River, the Huai River lost its proper way to enter the sea and accumulated in Hongze Lake, and was indirectly divided into the rivers and seas by other waters. Therefore, today's northern Jiangsu is bounded by the Huai River and the Grand Canal. The terrain of the entire territory is low, and the rivers and canals are vertical and horizontal. In the years of heavy water, the river surface is flourishing and rising, and the amount of water that can be contained in the Huai River is limited. When the Huai River has no way to discharge, it will surely cause harm to the lower reaches, especially in the area downstream of the river. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the river administration in northern Jiangsu was abandoned. After the restoration, the Communist Party rioted and specialized in looting, not in construction, and not in river administration. The people of the counties always held fears of land subsidence. After the National Army regained northern Jiangsu, the government and the Executive Headquarters carried out relief efforts, and signs of recovery have appeared in less than a year: but the ambushes in each county have not been completely eliminated, and they are waiting for major disasters in various places to instigate and use the disaster victims to create greater disturbances. The hidden dangers in northern Jiangsu are latent here; unfortunately, this time the disaster struck, and the scars reappeared, and the situation was bleak: if we do not urgently rise up to rescue, cure the root cause and treat the symptoms, and save the people from hanging upside down, the future of northern Jiangsu is really full of worries.

Regarding the relief of the flood disaster in northern Jiangsu, the local government and the people of Jiangsu Province have paid close attention to it; however, this kind of passive "pity" is not enough. We hope that the central government, the Executive Headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and all sectors of the province will focus on the root cause and treatment to seek stability in northern Jiangsu. If northern Jiangsu is stable, Jiangnan will be prosperous. If northern Jiangsu is stable, Shanghai will not be in danger overnight; if Jiangnan is prosperous, Shanghai will not be short of anything. We would like to express our views on the root cause and treatment here for the reference of relevant parties.

Passive flood relief is a symptomatic approach. According to our newspaper's telegram on the 8th, the government has allocated 1 billion yuan in relief funds and 10,000 boxes of canned food to help the disaster victims in the flooded area. At the same time, all sectors of the society in Jiangsu Province are launching an "Xu, Huai, and Hai Water Disaster Relief Association" to appeal to all sectors of Shanghai on behalf of the disaster victims in northern Jiangsu, to raise 20 billion yuan, and to ask the Executive Headquarters to allocate 5,000 tons of flour for relief needs. We hope that all sectors of Jiangsu Province will quickly start raising relief funds, and that the method of distribution must pay attention to practical effects to help the refugees return to their hometowns and the disaster-stricken farmers return to their fields: the government must also exempt military food requisitions and help them to recover. The active management of water and construction in northern Jiangsu is the fundamental solution. In the past, when Chen Guofu was in charge of Jiangsu, there was a plan to guide the Huai River and began to implement it, but unfortunately, the Anti-Japanese War broke out and it was interrupted. After the Jiangsu Provincial Government regained northern Jiangsu, it formulated the "Five-Year Plan for the Development of Northern Jiangsu", especially with detailed plans for sea defense, irrigation, and drainage: however, the required project cost was 320 billion yuan, and the central and local finances could not cope with it, and the plan still failed. The UNRRA Jiangsu-Ningbo Branch also formulated three plans to cooperate with the post-disaster work in the Yellow River flooded area in northern Jiangsu, such as guiding the Huai River, repairing the Yi River and Shu River, and coastal gates and dams. If implemented, they can all benefit the farmland water conservancy in northern Jiangsu. We hope that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will be sharp and promising: focusing on the construction of northern Jiangsu and the revitalization of northern Jiangsu as the focus of all administration, and according to the established plan, promote the central government and the Executive Headquarters to focus on the water control of northern Jiangsu. If the national treasury is short of money, it should also devise other methods and put it into practice. The Yichang Water Gate project was suspended halfway, and the people of Hubei have proposed to automatically donate to resume work: but as long as there is a center for everything, there is no way to do it.

In short, northern Jiangsu is very important at present. It is half of Jiangsu Province. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Battle of Xuzhou enabled Wuhan to be consolidated. The people and resources of Xuhai made great contributions. After the fall of Xuhai, the 36 counties suffered serious disasters. Since the restoration, it has been repeatedly ravaged by war. Today, a vast ocean surrounds the Huai River, and there are millions of refugees who have no clothes to wear, no place to live, and are crying for food. Returning to their hometowns to cultivate the land, post-disaster relief, and relief are really urgent; I hope that people from all walks of life will follow the spirit of benevolence and provide more relief to save the more than 10 million people in northern Jiangsu from the flood disaster and benefit northern Jiangsu. The stability of northern Jiangsu, the restoration of northern Jiangsu, and the prosperity of Jiangnan are all very important to the future of the country, so we should urgently plan to rescue the flood disaster in northern Jiangsu.

### Economic Storm Hits Bangkok: Shantou Far Ocean Company Branch Closure Causes Losses of 13 Billion to Overseas Chinese Remittances

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 7th] Upon learning last night from telegrams from Hong Kong and Shantou about the closure of the Shantou Far Ocean Company branch, an economic storm has once again struck Bangkok. The losses suffered by overseas Chinese who remitted money back to China through the company are currently known to exceed 13 billion yuan. It is said that this is the most serious economic crisis ever encountered by overseas Chinese in Thailand. Qualified observers believe that the Chinese money exchange industry in Bangkok will be completely paralyzed for at least two weeks.

[Another Telegram] The overseas Chinese economic community here, due to the unprecedented economic panic caused by the closure of several large money exchanges over the past three weeks, has seen the crisis largely subside with the full support of the Overseas Chinese Business Arbitration Aftermath Committee formed by influential overseas Chinese businessmen. This economic panic occurred in mid-July, when a branch of a local money exchange in Shantou failed to pay a large sum of overdue promissory notes, as well as remittances from overseas Chinese here.

### Lu Han Discusses Yunnan Provincial Politics and Schedules a Trip to the Northeast Next Month to Console the Yunnan Army

[This Newspaper, Kunming, 8th] After returning to Kunming from the capital, Yunnan Chairman Lu Han told reporters that he had sought instructions from the central government on several important matters. He first mentioned that if provincial finances are insufficient in the future, the central government will still allocate subsidies. County-level finances will adjust tax revenues and re-divide districts, adopting a two-pronged approach of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. Regarding public security, because there are still scattered bandits in Yunnan Province, the implementation period of the Bandit Suppression Law will be extended. The central government is concerned that the establishment of the Police and Security Department would affect the financial budget and that supply difficulties are numerous, so Yunnan Province will not establish it for the time being. As for the conscription quota of 14,000 for Yunnan Province, it will be fully conscripted by the end of September. If there is any delay due to transportation obstructions, the central government will also understand and sympathize with the difficulties. At this time of mobilization and suppression of the rebellion, it is hoped that everyone will share the difficulties and make every effort to do their best. Mr. Lu mentioned to reporters at the end that regarding the matter of going to the Northeast to console the Yunnan Army, he will set off in mid-September after the provincial affairs are arranged.

### Government Economic Emergency Measures Bill Passes Second Reading in the British House of Commons, Conservative Party Opposition Ultimately Fails

[This Newspaper] London, 8th Broadcast: The British House of Commons today passed the second reading of the government's Economic Emergency Measures Bill. Prior to this, Churchill delivered a speech criticizing the bill. Churchill said: "The government's proposal of this bill is tantamount to obtaining a blank check, to be used at will. Ministers can act in an authoritarian manner and make arbitrary decisions. Is this program necessary for the people's livelihood and the nation's revitalization? I believe this is a violation of British freedom and peacetime way of life: The opposition party has no confidence in the two-party government," he said. The government, on the other hand, firmly stated that the passage of this bill is necessary to cope with the current crisis.

[United Press, London, 8th] The House of Commons today passed the second reading of the government's emergency economic measures bill. An attempt to overturn the decision was defeated by 148 votes to 251. The government hopes to complete the remaining procedures before Parliament adjourns next Wednesday.

[United Press, London, 7th] Conservative Party leader Churchill this evening submitted a motion of censure to the House of Commons, requesting the rejection of the government's economic emergency measures plan. The nation was shocked, and the parliamentary debate was extremely serious. Churchill said: "As far as I can see, this bill gives the government totalitarian power, allowing it to abuse all the money taken from the hard-working people's pockets." Churchill originally intended not to participate in parliamentary debates before the resumption of Parliament in October this year, but he is now scheduled to attend tomorrow, despite his illness, to personally deliver a speech criticizing the government. Parliament has postponed the summer vacation from tomorrow to the beginning of next Wednesday to allow sufficient time to pass the government's plan. According to a Conservative Party spokesperson, given Churchill's attitude, the party will firmly oppose it, but because Labor Party members occupy a majority, although some leftists have criticized it, its passage is undoubtedly certain. Conservative Party Acting Leader Eden criticized the bill as hastily written, lacking deliberation, and incomplete, and said that what the government is asking us to consider is not a policy but a hope. At the same time, Treasury Secretary Dalton declared in the House of Commons that the number of troops will be reduced to 870,000 by the end of this year.

[United Press, London, 7th] British Treasury Secretary Stilton recently announced that the loans the United States has lent to Britain will be used up by October, so the purchase of food with cash should be stopped immediately, he said.

### Britain to Request Active Assistance from the United States, Relaxing the Terms of the Loan Agreement is Still Insufficient

[Reuters, London, 7th] Responsible sources here said that in the next meeting between Britain and the United States to discuss the economic crisis, Britain will request active assistance from the United States. Simply relaxing the terms of the British-American loan agreement is not enough to cope with the crisis facing Britain. There are two points that can be stated: (1) Assuming that it is impossible for the United States to lend to Britain again, if the U.S. Treasury Department agrees to retain British pound foreign exchange, it can achieve the same purpose as lending again. If so, the British pounds held by New York banks can be transferred to the U.S. Treasury Department without having to be converted into U.S. dollars by the representative of the Bank of England in New York, causing the United Kingdom's exhausted U.S. dollars to continue to decrease. (Canada has expressed its willingness to accept British pounds, but the United States must take action first.) However, the funds required for the U.S. Treasury Department to acquire British pounds held by New York banks may still require congressional approval.

(2) If the United States is willing to ask the International Monetary Fund to declare the U.S. dollar as a scarce currency, then after the declaration, Britain can be exempted from fulfilling the obligations in the loan agreement that it cannot discriminate and must convert British pound foreign exchange into U.S. dollars. The Bank of England only needs to order its representative in New York to no longer approve the conversion of British pounds held by New York banks into U.S. dollars. However, this method is not enough to solve the problem. If the U.S. Treasury Department does not agree to acquire the remaining British pounds held by New York banks, their value will inevitably fall, which will be a de facto devaluation of the British pound. This is something that Washington and London do not want.

### Indonesian-Dutch Dispute Likely to Fall into Another Stalemate, the Netherlands Unwilling to Accept International Arbitration, Indonesia Accepts Joint Mediation by the United States and Australia

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] It is reported that the Dutch government is prepared to reject any plan for compulsory arbitration of the Indonesian dispute. According to well-informed sources, the Dutch government agrees to accept the United States as an intermediary to help resolve the Indonesian issue, and does not oppose the United Nations Commission supervising the ceasefire, but is unwilling to accept the mediation or arbitration of the United Nations Commission. The Security Council has temporarily shelved the Indonesian issue and will discuss it again on Tuesday afternoon to give the representatives an opportunity to study the new proposal of the Indonesian government to establish an arbitration committee. The Dutch opinion is expressed at this time.

According to the Indonesian government's notification to the Security Council, on the one hand, it especially accepts U.S. mediation, and on the other hand, it asks the United States to persuade the Netherlands and the Security Council to agree to establish an arbitration mechanism. There is currently no formal proposal to establish an arbitration committee in the Security Council, but it can be asserted that someone will propose it within days. It is reported that the Australian representative is considering this plan, but said that he has not yet decided on action and will first find out the attitude of other representatives and the Dutch government. At the same time, it is planned to recommend to the Security Council that it send a United Nations Commission or formal inspectors to supervise the two-year truce. This plan will be distributed to the representatives of various countries before the meeting next Tuesday.

### British and French Foreign Ministers to Visit Washington This Autumn to Discuss Details of the Marshall Plan, U.S. Aid to Europe Bill Expected to Be Established by March Next Year

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] Responsible observers here believe that British Foreign Minister Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault will personally discuss the details of the "Marshall Plan" with Secretary of State Marshall in Washington this autumn in order to submit it to the U.S. Congress. The British and French foreign ministers are expected to come to New York in September to attend the United Nations General Assembly, at which time Secretary of State Marshall will likely invite them to Washington for discussions. Now that the U.S. Congress is in recess, there will not be any active activities on the Marshall Plan on the U.S. side in the next two days. However, the committees appointed by President Truman to study the internal economy and resources of the United States will continue to meet, and their reports can be obtained at approximately the same time as the report of the Paris Sixteen Nations Conference. The report of the State Department's Policy Committee on the needs of European recovery can also be completed in mid-September. After receiving this report, the U.S. government will first study it itself, and then solicit the opinions of European countries. The visit of Bevin and Bidault to the United States can participate in this work. Although Marshall and his assistants maintain regular contact with influential people in Congress during the congressional recess, Marshall deeply hopes that before Congress debates the European aid plan, he can first reach some consensus with important figures in Congress. It is expected that the legislative draft submitted to Congress can be completed in November, at which time the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin the committee stage review of the case. In addition to President Truman, key internal officials such as Marshall himself, Treasury Secretary Snyder, Commerce Secretary Harriman, Agriculture Secretary Anderson, and Interior Secretary Krug will all testify before the Foreign Relations Committee, and people from the industrial, agricultural, financial, and labor union leaders will also be invited to express their opinions. The review process of this committee is expected to take six weeks, which will be in December. If there is still time before the Christmas holiday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will then begin a similar process. Congress will resume its session in the first week of January next year, at which time the report, the bill, and the review report of the committee can be listed as the first item on the Senate's agenda for debate. There are more opponents in the House of Representatives, so it is expected that if the Senate can end the debate in two weeks, the House of Representatives will need at least four to six weeks to complete the debate on the case. Therefore, this European aid bill can be expected to complete the legislative procedures before the beginning of March at the earliest.

### Foreign Trade Recovery is Near, Japan Requests Input of Raw Materials, Exports Can Be Exempt from Government-Fixed Price Restrictions

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Raze, Director of the Trade Bureau of the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board, declared at a symposium of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on the 7th: (1) Raw Material Countermeasures: Japan's past exports accounted for 23% of the national income, from which it can be seen the degree of Japan's dependence on exports. However, Japan's exports cannot exist without the input of raw materials from overseas, so the promotion of exports in the future depends on increasing the necessity of importing such raw materials. The current guiding principle is to make effective use of insufficient raw materials and apply them most to exports. (2) Financial Countermeasures: The Economic Stabilization Board will ensure that manufacturers permitted for trade are not subject to financial difficulties. (3) The price of products takes not disrupting the price system as a premise, and an exceptional price is set for those products that are intended for export but do not meet government-fixed prices.

### Reorganizing Morality and Reforming Social Customs; Solemnly Commemorating Father's Day; Speaker Pan Explains That Being Filial to Parents Is Being Loyal to the Country

[Our News] The Father's Day Promotion Committee, organized by various circles in this city, held a commemoration meeting for Father's Day at the YMCA at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 300 people from all walks of life attended. Shan Lujian, on behalf of the presidium, presided over the ceremony and delivered a speech explaining the significance of Father's Day and the process of its initiation, saying that all countries in the world have Mother's Day. Loyal people in Shanghai initiated and promoted Father's Day during the period of enemy occupation to show their respect for virtue and gratitude and to resist the enemy puppets. Then, Mr. Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, explaining that being filial to parents is being loyal to the country, and filial piety is the starting point of all good deeds. The filial piety mentioned in "The Classic of Filial Piety" is broad and profound, and it is by no means that accompanying parents on festive days can be called filial piety. He also cited Zengzi's words: serving the ruler without loyalty is not filial piety, performing official duties without respect is not filial piety, not being trustworthy to friends is not filial piety, and being without courage in war is not filial piety. By extension, being filial to parents is being loyal to the country and the nation. Some people previously advocated non-filial piety, which would really make mankind fall into the realm of beasts. Mr. Pan quoted extensively and elaborated in detail, moving the audience. Next, Yuan Xilian, Yan Duhe, Wang Xiaoji, and others gave speeches successively. Mr. Zheng said that he now has dozens of children and daughters-in-law, and over two hundred grandchildren. Hearing the sound of "Dad" is certainly gratifying, but in reality, children do not know how difficult it is to be a father. Finally, 8-year-old student Huang Junjie gave a speech. During the meeting, Zhou Jiaoqing proposed that the Senate and the Education Bureau discuss listing "The Classic of Filial Piety" as reading material for all schools, and Speaker Pan indicated that he would be happy to endorse it. Subsequently, prizes were awarded, and the film "Home of Loyalty" was shown by China Electric before the meeting adjourned.

### The First and Second Factories of China Tobacco Company to Be Purchased Separately with Priority by the Original Owners; The First Warehouse Has Also Been Reviewed and Returned

[Our News] After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the China Tobacco Company was ordered to take over the Japanese-owned Huadong and Huapin Tobacco Companies.

The China Tobacco Company also has the First Warehouse on Dengtuo Road, which was originally the property of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. This time, it has also been reviewed and returned. However, because a large number of paper and other received materials are still stored in the warehouse, the company previously rented it from the Nanyang Brothers Company for 80 million yuan in warehouse rent.

### Yu Shengxiao Murder Case; Evidence Collected; Que Li Admits to Being Committed by Malay; Intended to Purchase Gold, Greed Arose; Ma Confesses to Being Intoxicated in the Car

[Our News] The case of the shooting of Yu Shengxiao, who was engaged in the black market gold trade, has been under investigation for six days since the Englishman Que Li Aque was arrested. The case has now entered a bright stage and the truth will soon be revealed.

Although Que Li initially denied it, after six days of "fatigue interrogation" by the police, he has now admitted that Yu Shengxiao was indeed shot by Malay. He testified to the police yesterday: "Que and Yu Shengxiao were both 'scalpers' engaged in the black market gold and banknote trade. The incident occurred when Malay wanted to ask him to buy five gold bars. He did not have any in hand, so he negotiated with Yu Shengxiao. After the agreement, Malay agreed to go to Hongqiao Airport in the afternoon to pay. At that time, the three of them agreed to go together in a sedan, but unexpectedly, they drove into a deserted area in the suburbs, and Malay became greedy when he saw the money."

At the same time, Malay reportedly admitted to the interrogating points in the American Military Police that he had been in the car with Que Li to Hongqiao on that day, but regarding the shooting of Yu

According to news revealed by the police, all the evidence has been largely collected, and clues to the car and pistol have been obtained. In order to search for bullet casings, Que Li was escorted to the scene of the incident a few days ago, but returned without results. According to investigations, Que Li had previously committed two crimes and was sentenced to two and six months in prison, respectively. The crimes were fraud and theft.

[Our News] Three thieves suddenly came to the Tianshengxiang Cigarette and Paper Shop at No. 41 Huayi Street, Nanshi, at 11:30 p.m. the night before, robbed two gold rings from the maid's hand and earrings and gold rings from the mistress, and fled out the door. However, one thief was still acting as a lookout at the door and was slower to flee. He was grabbed by the shop owner, Xu Xiaobing, and handed over to the police, who took him to the Penglai Police Sub-Bureau. He confessed his name as Lin Agao and that the thieves' den was at No. 95 Mingdeli, Huaji Road. Section member Wu Zhipeng, police chief Tong Bairong, police officer Zhang Yuting, and others immediately escorted the thief Lin to hunt down the other robbers. Unexpectedly, after the three thieves succeeded, they felt hungry. On the way, they mortgaged the two gold rings to a fruit stall owner for 20,000 yuan in cash and went to a nearby food stall to eat. They threw the pistol into the bamboo fence opposite, but accidentally dropped another gold ring. While they were searching for it, the police arrived and arrested them. The three thieves were named Gu Jiufu, Han Hairong, and Zhang Yongbiao. The case took less than three hours from the time it happened to the time it was solved.

### Secret Compartment in Movable Wall Hides Drugs; Eighteen Criminals Arrested After Four-Way Search

[Our News] The Laozha Police Bureau recently received a tip-off that drugs were being sold in Room 105 of the Sutai Hotel on Fuzhou Road.

### Yang's Chemical Research Institute Plans to Expand Business

[Our News] Yang's Chemical Treatment Research Institute, which invented the anti-syphilis needle drug "New Xihua Powder," was established on August 15, 1937. At that time, it only occupied one building at No. 1267 Yuyuan Road and built a small laboratory for private research. Later, due to practical needs, the scale gradually expanded. To date, the original site has occupied six buildings, and two Western-style houses on the third floor of the Xinyi Building are occupied in the north. More than 20 kinds of prepared medicines have been produced. It was not expected that this small laboratory would become the core of the entire institution today.

When the reporter visited yesterday, it was "small but complete." The research institute is well-equipped, with thousands of kinds of machinery. When Dr. Yang Shuxun talked about future plans, he said that he intended to use traditional Chinese medicine to develop the domestic chemical industry. Another goal is to cooperate with other research institutes to improve related chemical industries. At the same time, he plans to jointly promote the establishment of a library in Shanghai specifically for industrial reference to meet the common needs of the industry.

Telecommunications Q&A

### Answered by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

[Summary] (1) The Q&A in this column will be disclosed once a week on Saturdays. (2) Letters are limited to questions related to telecommunications business. (3) Please indicate "Telecommunications Business" on the letter. (4) The text should be concise. (5) Please write your real name and address on the letter. We may reply directly by letter if necessary.

[Xiao Choucheng from Maoming Road asks] (1) Are there distinctions between ordinary, urgent, and express long-distance calls? What are their natures? (Answer) Yes. Urgent and ordinary calls are divided into call number, call person, and call out. Urgent calls are connected within one hour after registration. Ordinary calls are connected within two hours after registration. However, for call-out calls, you must wait until the recipient arrives at the business office of the bureau before the call can be connected. Express calls are connected within ten minutes after registration. Currently, it is open to Wuxian, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Yin County, Jiaxing and other seven places. Only one type of call number communication is temporarily open, and it is limited to two times when busy. (2) If Deng Ren has any unclear points about your bureau's long-distance telephone business, where can he inquire? (Answer) If users have any questions about our bureau's long-distance telephone business, or if the service of the long-distance station duty operator is not satisfactory, they can call "482788" or 〇2 "61442" our bureau's "Inquiry and Complaint Station" for inquiry and complaint.

[Sun Ming from Julu Road asks] When I send telegrams, I deeply feel that the text is lengthy, which costs money and time. Is there a way to save money? (Answer) In addition to shortening the telegram as much as possible, the recipient's address can also be simplified. For example, "No. 1568 Nanjing Road" has a total of eleven characters. If it is written as "Nanjing Road (1568)," it is only five characters. If you can use registration instead of the recipient's name and address, only one character is needed.

[Xia Rongming from Tushanwan, Xujiahui asks] How is long-distance telephone billing calculated? (Answer) The long-distance telephone billing standard is divided into six types: ordinary call number, call person, call out, urgent call number, call person, and call out. They are calculated according to the ratio of 1.1.5.2.2.2.5.3. For example, if the ordinary call number price from Shanghai to Wuxi is 7,000 yuan, then the ordinary call person is 10,500 yuan, the ordinary call out is 14,000 yuan, the urgent call number is 14,000 yuan, the urgent call person is 17,500 yuan, and the urgent call out is 21,000 yuan. Fractions below 1,000 yuan are not counted if they are below 250 yuan. If they are between 250 yuan and 700 yuan, they are calculated as 500 yuan. If they are above 750 yuan, they are calculated as 1,000 yuan. The cancellation fee is charged at one-fifth of the ordinary call number, with a minimum amount of 500 yuan and a maximum amount of 7,500 yuan. The rest is deduced by analogy.

### Large-Scale Smuggling in South China

— Special Correspondent Liang Feng, Guangzhou, 3rd

The rampant smuggling in South China has long been a well-known fact nationwide. Because of the presence of Hong Kong and Macau, Guangzhou has become the general hub for the import and export of smuggled goods. Therefore, the occurrence of smuggling cases involving tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of dollars, is as common as "daily meals" and not surprising. However, the recent crackdown by the Guangdong Customs on the

### Foshan Ferry Smuggling Case from Hong Kong

cannot help but draw attention, because the amount of smuggled goods involved is truly shocking and represents an unprecedented record for the Guangdong Customs in terms of the scale of its anti-smuggling efforts.

The case was cracked on July 25th. The Foshan ferry arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong that morning. However, the customs had already received a tip-off the day before, stating that the ferry was carrying a large number of smuggled goods and attempting to evade taxes upon entry. On the morning of the 25th, the customs dispatched anti-smuggling personnel, accompanied by military police, aboard a vessel to the Tie Men area outside Huangpu, where they boarded the ferry to conduct a routine search for smuggled goods and closely monitored the suspected areas. Around 7:00 a.m., the ferry arrived in the city, and the customs dispatched additional personnel to board the ferry and conduct a search. However, no smuggled goods were found anywhere. Later, customs officers searched according to the reported location and discovered 108 pieces of smuggled goods (each approximately 90 cubic meters in volume) hidden within the ship's hull lining and coal piles in the engine room. In the afternoon, they received another tip-off stating that there were still some smuggled goods hidden on board. The customs then dispatched more personnel to search, and they discovered another 85 large packages and 13 small items of similar smuggled goods, totaling 193 large items and 13 small items. These included valuable items such as ginseng, deer velvet, expensive Chinese and Western medicines, automobile parts, foreign leather, cellophane, pigments, saccharin, and other valuable goods, weighing over 30,000 pounds and valued at over HK$300,000, equivalent to approximately 2 billion yuan in current national currency. At that time, customs police and military police escorted the batch of smuggled goods back to the customs for processing.

After the incident occurred, the 26th Regiment of the stationed military police in Guangzhou immediately sent personnel to inquire about the shipowner Newton and the engineer A. Chen (both British). However, they claimed that they were completely unaware of the smuggling and that it was carried out secretly by

### Workers in the Engine Room

They also stated that five engine room workers had fled after the incident. The customs also submitted a written inquiry to the shipowner that evening. The shipowner replied that the smuggled goods may have been smuggled onto the ship in Hong Kong on the 23rd or 24th. This answer was, of course, an attempt to shirk responsibility, because the volume and number of smuggled goods were so large that it would have taken considerable time to move them from the shore onto the ship and hide them in the hull lining and coal piles of the coal bunker, and it would not have been possible to hide this from the eyes and ears of ordinary personnel. If it were not for the connivance of senior personnel on the ship, how could this have happened? Moreover, according to the authorities' investigation, the hidden compartment for storing the smuggled goods seemed to have been specially manufactured. The compartment door was closed with an iron door and secured with fixed screws, a technique of extreme ingenuity (as shown in the picture). Therefore, from this speculation, it is likely that this was a

### Planned Smuggling Activity.

The shipowner's claim of not knowing is clearly an excuse. The military police and customs have now reported the matter to the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, demanding that the shipowner hand over the five escaped workers and the masterminds, and ordering the ship to be suspended from sailing. The ship is currently being detained on the Bai'etan River surface in Guangzhou.

The Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief attaches great importance to this case. This reporter interviewed Deputy Director Deng Nengguang, who stated that this is a major smuggling case in South China. The central government has long recognized that the issue of smuggling in South China affects the national economy and is determined to eradicate it at the root. Therefore, the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief is paying special attention to this case and has sent personnel to the ship to photograph all the hidden equipment and a large batch of smuggled goods for record-keeping. At the same time, a special report has been submitted to the central government to request instructions. Deng also stated that the ferry and the Wuxue ferry, which was previously involved in smuggling, belong to the same company, Taikoo Dockyard. The company has not yet fulfilled the fine imposed on the previous Wuxue ship for smuggling. Now, the company's Foshan ferry is involved in large-scale smuggling again. Who can believe that this is not a planned act by the personnel on the ship?

As for the Taikoo Dockyard, it has not yet made any statement.

After this case occurred, it became a topic of conversation on the streets. Some people even said: The smuggled goods are worth HK$300,000, and including the small-scale smuggling that has not been investigated, it should be over HK$400,000, which is equivalent to more than US$93,000, and it is not much different from the quota of US$100,000 approved by the Transportation Control Committee for import to Guangzhou this quarter. This remark is naturally a bit satirical, but it is also sufficient to provide for the authorities' reference. If smuggling cannot be stopped, then import restrictions are not just a formality?

### Uranium! Rich and Pure Production in Guangxi. Scientists to Set Off for Mining. Equipment for Bombarding Atomic Nuclei Has Been Ordered from the United States

[Guangxi Guangshe News] Uranium ore is the basic raw material for making atomic bombs. Some scientists around the world have exhausted their efforts to successfully research it. However, this mineral is extremely rare in production. Currently, the only uranium-producing areas in the world are Colorado and Utah in the United States, Kantanga in the Belgian Congo, Great Bear Lake in Canada, Cornwall in the United Kingdom, Madagascar, and a small amount of production in southern Australia, the Czech Republic, and Portugal in the Soviet Union. Therefore, research and experimentation are extremely difficult. In May 1943, Chinese geologist Nan Yanzong went to Guangxi to investigate tin ore and discovered this type of uranium ore in Huangqiangping, Honghua District, Zhongshan. He took the sample back to the Geological Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, where geologist Wu Leibo used microchemical analysis to prove that it was indeed pure uranium ore. Last year, the Mineral Survey and Exploration Office of the Resources Committee, together with the Central Geological Survey, sent geologists to Guangxi for detailed investigation. It was found that the Huangqiangping mining area and its vicinity are all composed of granite, followed by the intrusion of albite porphyry, which is then drilled by pegmatitic granite. The uranium ore grows along the twist surface of the albite porphyry. The determined uranium-containing minerals include pitchblende, carnotite, autunite, mica, calcium-uranium mica, and uranophane. Not only are the reserves abundant, but the quality is also extremely pure, far superior to the uranium ore found in Haicheng, Northeast China, and Samantian and Yuxin in Wuyuan, Suiyuan, and Maotou Town in Northeast China. It is reported that relevant parties believe that this type of uranium ore is extremely rare and that efforts should be made to conduct research, catch up, and add a unique color to the Chinese scientific community in terms of science, national defense, industry, and human happiness. It has now been decided to hire many authorities in the scientific community to go to Guangxi to engage in development for experimentation. Preparations are currently being made, and they will depart as soon as they are completed. As for the instrument for bombarding atomic nuclei, it has been ordered from the United States and can be transported to Guangxi via Hong Kong in the near future. (8th)

### Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Protection Command Orders the Suppression of Bandits in Taihu Lake

[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 8th] The Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Protection Command telegraphed the Suzhou County government today, stating that Jin Jiarang, a bandit in Taihu Lake who was once pacified, gathered more than 300 people this spring due to a large deficit and fled back to the lake to become a bandit, frequenting the vicinity of Xishan and specializing in robbing merchant ships. In addition, more than ten remnants of the lake bandit Liao Bingnan's gang, due to supply difficulties, have surrendered to the Communist bandit Xue Shuihui's troops. The county government is requested to order the security police to cooperate with the National Army and jointly suppress the bandits with Zou County.

### Clouds and Mist Hanging Low, Deep Wind and Rain. Summer Capital Presents Autumnal Scenery

[Report from Guling, this newspaper, 8th] This newspaper's reporter sent a telegram one hour after arriving in Guling. Outside the window, clouds and mist hang low, the wind and rain are uncertain, and the mountains are lush green, with white clouds drifting in between. This is indeed the place where one is already in the "deep clouds, location unknown." The autumn atmosphere in the mountains arrived much earlier than the Beginning of Autumn. This year's summer capital is obviously different from last year's. One reason is that the date of the Chairman's arrival has not been determined, and there is no political atmosphere here except for news reporters. Another reason is that the essence of Guling's city streets was destroyed in a major fire this spring and is currently being rebuilt after the disaster. However, everything presents an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.

### Jiangsu Province Handles General Election Work, to Divide into Seven Electoral Districts

The Provincial Election Affairs Office could have been established on a regular basis, but it has not yet been established due to the fact that the two committee members Shen and Zhu have not yet arrived in the province. Currently, committee member Shen Peng and others have sent telegrams urging committee members Shen and Zhu to come to Zhenjiang as soon as possible to discuss everything and promote election affairs. They have also transferred personnel from the Civil Affairs Department to handle relevant election transfer documents. According to Shen Peng, Jiangsu Province plans to establish seven electoral districts to handle general election work.

### Miss Hong Kong Files for Divorce. In Addition to Verbal Complaints, She Issues a Written Statement

[Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng, 5th, Hong Kong, this newspaper] Wu Danfeng, the "Miss Hong Kong" who finally emerged after much anticipation, signed a contract with the Sino-British Film Company on the night she was elected to play the female lead in a certain film. Thus, "Miss Hong Kong" leaped to become a "movie star"! The radio station then hired her to host a special broadcast of contemporary songs, and the advertisement inevitably added the honorific title of "Queen of Song." For a time, "fortune arrived unexpectedly," and after Wu Danfeng ascended the dragon gate, she immediately made rapid progress and became the "most important woman" in Hong Kong. She was so busy with being invited to cut ribbons, inscribe titles, dine, and take photos that she was overwhelmed.

### Not Miss, But Actually "Mrs. Hong Kong"

As the saying goes, extremes meet, and excessive joy breeds sorrow. Recently, this "Miss Hong Kong" suddenly became the target of attacks. It turned out that this "Miss" had already been married and had already given birth to a son and a daughter! This fake "Miss" naturally disappointed the enthusiastic supporters. "Miss Hong Kong" changed to "Mrs. Hong Kong," which was both comical and laughable. After this secret was exposed, "Miss Hong Kong's" limelight was not as strong as before.

### Destroying Beauty, Her Husband Actually Used His Fists

Logically, being the husband of "Miss Hong Kong" is a matter of great honor. However, Wu's husband, Qu Xiyuan, believed that "Miss Hong Kong" brought him infinite humiliation. Wu went to participate in the competition in Macau that time, and it was hidden from him beforehand. Later, Qu saw the Hong Kong newspapers in Macau, learned about this news, rushed to Hong Kong, and scolded her severely. After verbal conflict, Qu also used his fists and monitored Wu's actions, not allowing her to cross the line. On August 1, there was another conflict between the couple. "Miss Hong Kong" was petite and weak, how could she be a match for her husband's ferocity? As a result, she was beaten with bruises all over her body, whimpering like a pear blossom in the rain. Destroying beauty is really too insensitive, Mr. Qu.

### Proceeding with Divorce, Issuing a "Written Statement"

After being beaten, "Miss Hong Kong" went to stay temporarily at the home of her brother, Wu Bang, and filed a lawsuit and formally filed for divorce. When reporters went to interview Wu Danfeng, they saw many scars on her jade arms and tears in her eyes, and they all sympathized with her unfortunate experience. In addition to verbally complaining about her husband's abuse, she also issued a "written statement" as follows:

"The accumulated grievances and sorrows of my life over the past ten years or so have been released a little today. I want to divorce him so that we, a resentful couple with different opinions, can both find a new path in life after the divorce. If I continue to endure it and am often beaten and scolded and arbitrarily destroyed by him, my future and happiness will be greatly hindered and harmed. His attitude is really irritable and is becoming more and more intense. But I finally declare that the reason for the divorce is not the motive after I was elected "Miss Hong Kong," but it is really compelled to be so. I hope the public understands the truth of the matter."

After the divorce, Wu Danfeng will be the "Hong Kong Miss" who is "true to her name."

### Bachuan and Zhenghe Banks Collapse Simultaneously, Deficient in Total Funds of 6.8 Billion; Related to the Suspension of Zhenghe in Hong Kong

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhenghe Bank at 205 Nanjing Road and Bachuan Bank at 731 on the same road in this city were both unable to promptly compensate for the lack of funds in the clearinghouse yesterday. The clearinghouse issued a circular to suspend clearing for both banks.

Both Zhenghe and Bachuan Banks are listed as agent clearing houses in the clearinghouse. Zhenghe's clearing house number is 211, and Bachuan's is 150. According to the results of the clearinghouse on the 7th, Zhenghe had a shortfall of 2.7 billion yuan, and Bachuan had a shortfall of 4.1 billion yuan. According to the clearinghouse's regulations, the balance must be compensated by 8:30 PM that evening. After a concession was made to extend the deadline to 9:10 AM yesterday morning,

both banks still failed to find a way to compensate. The clearinghouse immediately sent a circular to each clearing house to suspend the banks' check clearing starting from today (the 8th). As of 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, both banks were still unable to compensate, and the clearinghouse immediately reported the situation to the Ministry of Finance for record.

It is understood that the liquidity problems of the two banks are directly related to the sudden suspension of Zhenghe Bank in Hong Kong on the 6th. The current chairman of both banks is Peng Bingcheng, who also serves as the chairman of the Far East Trading Company. It is reported that recently, the Far East Company transported a large batch of surplus materials from overseas. After arriving at the port, prices were stagnant, and the funds stuck as a result have reached several billion yuan. In addition, Zhenghe Bank in Hong Kong made strategic mistakes, and there is also talk of the Far East Company's branch in Siam shutting down, causing a rush to withdraw funds, which dragged everyone into the vortex.

The Operating Principles Have Always Been Unsound

According to a person in charge of a certain department of the Central Bank speaking to reporters: The account books of the two banks have been repeatedly inspected by personnel from the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. It was discovered that the lending business was too loose, and the operating principles were unsound. Every night, a large amount of cash had to be融解to compensate for the overdrafts in the clearinghouse, so warnings had been repeatedly given. Fortunately, the unstable operating conditions of the two banks had long been rumored among industry peers, so everyone was cautious and guarded against it in advance. After the suspension of clearing, there was no impact on the industry. It is now found that the two banks have a deposit reserve of approximately 400 million yuan in the National Bank. The total amount of deposits in the two banks is approximately 3.5 billion yuan or more, leaving a shortfall of over 3.1 billion yuan. In addition, the balance of accounts receivable and payable on the two banks' books is a shortfall of more than 2 billion yuan. The amount of arrears is not significant, and it is hoped that they can be urged to clear them up within a short period of time.

According to the observation of the person in charge: The aftermath issues of the two banks: handled in accordance with the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, although the two banks are called branches in this city, because the center of the business is in Shanghai, according to regulations, the licenses should be revoked. However, it is said that the head office of Zhenghe Bank is registered in Hong Kong, and it may be handled separately.

### China Trust Bureau Adopts a Flexible Approach to Weekly Pricing of Rayon; Silk Weaving Industry Sets to Hold Members' Meeting Tomorrow

The issue of the pricing of rayon by the China Trust Bureau is still being appealed by the silk weaving industry. The China Trust Bureau is still listening to the instructions from above, but there are currently no signs that the pricing can be changed. According to a person in charge of the Bureau, the Bureau's pricing is determined to be adjusted once a week. The pricing is based on past prices. At the beginning of the allocation last year, the pricing was close to the black market price. At that time, the pricing of Jin San Ma was 2.78 million, while the black market price was 3.3 million. Subsequently, due to the time-consuming nature of government documents going back and forth, the pricing had an opposite distance from the black market. In the future, a flexible approach should be adopted to cope with the evolution of the market. If the black market price decreases next week, the pricing can be changed. A 10% reduction in market prices this time is reasonable.

It is also reported that the silk weaving industry held a small group meeting in the guild yesterday afternoon because the request to reduce the price of rayon sold by the bureau was not granted. The meeting decided to unite the factories to write to the industry guild and convene a general meeting immediately to allow all members to vote on their opinions. It is reported that the members' meeting has been scheduled to be held at the Chamber of Commerce on Sunday (the 10th) at 8:30 AM.

### Too Low a Price is Also Not Appropriate

Also reported: According to Wu Rencang, Director of the China Trust Bureau, the black market price of rayon has been hovering around 24 million recently. The Bureau has 6,000 boxes of rayon in stock, which is not enough for market demand. If the price is too low, it will be convenient for manufacturers to profit from it. The opinion of Director Wu of the bureau is limited to an increase of 50%, that is, the price of each box is 13.5 million yuan, which is too low. The bureau is currently discussing it. The pricing will be increased by about 100% compared to the previous 9 million yuan. The decision date is not far away.

### China Trust Bureau Purchases Cased Tea; Pays 60% of Standard Price in Advance; Qihong Price at 720,000 Yuan per Dan

The standard price of Qihong is 720,000 yuan per dan, Tunlv is 900,000 yuan, and Pinglv is 480,000 yuan, each paid at 60% in advance.

Also reported: Since the buying interest in domestic and foreign tea has shrunk, the market has not been as active as it has been in recent days, and the transaction volume has also been frequently reduced.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Again

I happened to hear some people at a meeting of doctors advocating greatly expanding the number of doctors in terms of quantity. Whether they are graduates of formal medical schools, or nurses, or hospital attendants, as long as they can obtain a license issued by the government. Because in the pitiful Chinese country, it is really unknown how many thousands of people it takes to find a Western doctor. When we run around the mainland, we may be able to buy cigarettes everywhere, but it is difficult to buy even the most basic aspirin or Bagua Dantou pain powder, not to mention so-called Western doctors and pharmacies. Therefore, for the sake of practical benefits, it is best to produce a large number of doctors in the short term, without having to overemphasize the qualitative aspects, because no matter what, "having" is better than "not having" after all.

True, this argument sounds really pleasant. When we review the current state of the Chinese medical community, we certainly want to support this argument with 120,000 points. However, there are two points that we should pay attention to, and we must raise them for everyone to discuss:

(1) The speaker, facing the realistic needs, advocates greatly expanding the number of doctors in terms of quantity. This is an undeniable good theory. However, the speaker forgot his own identity, abandoned his own rights and interests, and the doctors who were on the same front as him. Because the "purpose" of organizing a guild is nothing more than using the power of the guild to protect the rights and interests of all members. Now the speaker only thinks that there is a lack of medical personnel in the country and advocates producing a large number of doctors, but he forgot that he is not an official, and he forgot that he is only a public servant elected by the members of the medical association. Shanghai is already crowded with many doctors. Of course, there are many with good business, but there are more with bad business. If we continue to relax the dimensions and produce many doctors, and they crowd into Shanghai and refuse to go elsewhere, wouldn't that directly harm the rights and interests of the members themselves? To be honest, many members are also complaining about heaven and earth.

(2) Which is more beneficial or harmful, the expansion of "quantity" or the enrichment of "quality"? We are not the authorities responsible for medical administration, so we are not in a position to speak. I only hope that everyone will pay attention

to the history of the past decades without scissors for Western medicine, then we can know that the expansion of quantity does not necessarily make sense.

Okay! If the speaker has not forgotten his own position, if the speaker knows that he must protect the rights and interests of the members of the medical association, and if he has no other intentions, then this distorted theory should be published less in the future.

### Important Notice for Students Taking Medical School Entrance Exams (Part 1)

— Ruan Shangcheng

The government's purpose in encouraging students to learn foreign languages is to "seek knowledge." However, as it has evolved to this day, it has had other, more important effects besides seeking knowledge, especially in our medical field. All students taking medical school entrance exams should pay attention to this.

On the European continent in the mid-19th century, almost all those in charge of health administration were legal experts. Later, medical administration gradually fell into the hands of those who studied medicine. In recent years, in English-speaking countries, it has gone a step further, with only those who have studied public health being able to specialize in health administration. Compared with continental countries, there are still similarities.

In our country, in all academic fields, no matter which foreign language is studied, although there are different factions, they can still cooperate and work together. However, our medical field is very different, and of course, there are reasons for this. Here are the main ones: (1) There are more medical personnel who study English than those who study other foreign languages. (2) Since the introduction of modern medicine in China, English-speaking countries have advanced both evangelism and medicine. In the past, patients who wanted to receive Western medical treatment had to go to a church hospital, and English and American Protestant churches were more widespread in China than old churches. Therefore, hospitals or medical schools were established everywhere, and almost all Chinese people who studied medicine studied English (very few studied French or German) and could obtain opportunities for practice and further study everywhere. The number of factories or industrial schools established in China by English and American countries is far less than the number of hospitals and medical schools. Therefore, it is not as convenient for people to study other subjects as it is for medicine. (3) In English-speaking hospitals, for the sake of foreigners, everything is of course done in English. When Chinese medical students discuss medical conditions in front of patients, in order to avoid the patients' worries and prevent them from knowing the dangers of their conditions, they all communicate in English. Moreover, because the Chinese medical terminology has not yet been finalized, it is more convenient to talk in a foreign language than to speak Chinese. After many years, there are very few opportunities to use Chinese every day. Therefore, in daily life, whether it is social events, lectures, or even letters and official documents, everything is in English. In addition, foreign-run schools consider Chinese to be an unimportant subject, so not everyone can know the application of Chinese and the beauty of Chinese. (4) Since the success of the revolution in our country and the establishment of health administration, medical science has received a large amount of subsidies from English-speaking countries, and the methods of health administration have of course followed the same path as English-speaking countries. Those who study public health can even take charge of party health administration. Under this trend, it is inevitable that there will be places where people are controlled, but for the sake of current interests, why wouldn't the government take the easy route? Even those who only understand English but cannot read Chinese characters or speak Chinese can hold great power in medical affairs, and society does not find it strange. Moreover, after the victory, those who speak Japanese manage the Japanese, and those who speak German manage the Germans. This is a natural principle and also the easy route. There is absolutely no reason to send someone who studies Russian to manage the Japanese and create trouble for themselves.

### Sunlight and Health (Part 2)

— Yu Zhengxing

Eighth, regarding the relationship with dust: Pathogens living in dust can be killed by strong sunlight, reducing the risk of disease transmission caused by dust flying around.

The above points show the relationship between sunlight and life, and its inseparable connection with a healthy life. However, whether sunlight is beneficial or harmful to the human body is a point that should be explored. We know that the main source of sunlight is sunlight. Due to the different lengths of light waves, it is divided into ultraviolet rays and infrared rays. The light waves we see every day are only a part of the light waves. Now, according to the different light waves, we will describe their impact on health:

(1) Light: Daily work is completed with the help of light. Too weak or too strong light can hinder health. Because the main function of light is to illuminate work, this is a direct relationship. Indirectly, when light shines into the body, people can absorb light and convert it into heat. Therefore, a part of the human body's warmth is obtained from external light and used as kinetic energy for bodily functions, such as hematopoiesis and metabolism. If you work in the dark for a long time, you can gradually weaken, develop anemia, and contract pulmonary tuberculosis. The relationship between light and the eyes is very important. If the light is too weak, it is easy to become nearsighted because the eye muscles lengthen and cannot contract. There is also the possibility of developing nystagmus due to too weak light. This is because the eye muscles are fatigued and the convergence is uncoordinated, making it impossible to concentrate and seeing objects as if there are two, completely unable to fixate. If the light is too strong, there are fewer obstacles to the eyes. However, working under strong light for a long time can irritate the eyes and cause fatigue, leading to nearsightedness. It can also specifically cause night blindness and scotoma, which are all caused by too strong light. The protective method is to wear colored glasses and not work under too weak or too strong light for a long time. It would be even better to find a way to adjust the light intensity naturally.

(2) Ultraviolet Rays: Ultraviolet rays have a strong lethal effect on bacteria and a destructive effect on human cells. If irradiated for a long time, it can cause symptoms such as redness, pain, and blisters. However, the body has the function of absorbing ultraviolet light. Although the skin's dermis is damaged, it cannot penetrate deep layers and destroy body cavity tissues. At the same time, the body has a protective effect of pigment deposition. After sunbathing, the skin changes to protect the skin from being destroyed by ultraviolet rays and can absorb ultraviolet rays, convert them into heat, and transport them into the body, stimulating the functions of various parts. In addition to the irritating effect of ultraviolet rays on the eyes, many occupational diseases, such as those who work in X-ray and artificial sun exposure, suffer from ultraviolet light irritation, causing eye inflammation, conjunctival inflammation around the eyes, and red, swollen, and painful eyelids. It can cause the cornea to become turbid. If it is more severe, it can cause the lens to solidify and become cataracts. Wearing brown, yellow, and black glasses can absorb ultraviolet rays and protect the eyes.

Ultraviolet rays also have benefits for the body, such as rickets, poor bone development, bone changes, and cartilage, which are mostly caused by a deficiency of vitamin D, resulting in impaired calcium and phosphorus metabolism. This is due to a lack of vitamin D in food, but a sufficient amount of this vitamin can also be obtained by ultraviolet irradiation. Because there is cholesterol in the body under the skin, it can be converted into vitamin D after being irradiated by ultraviolet rays. Therefore, more sunbathing can supplement the lack of vitamin D in food and prevent poor bone development.

(3) Infrared Rays: Infrared rays themselves have heat and can penetrate deep into the human body. This is related to the length of the light wave. Short light waves are easily absorbed, while long light wave infrared rays can penetrate the skin by several centimeters, stimulating physiological functions. Therefore, under unsuitable circumstances, many people suffer from heatstroke in the summer (infrared rays penetrate into the brain, and the brain becomes dizzy from the heat). Therefore, when working in the sun in summer, it is advisable to wear a white hat and not work for too long. In addition, prolonged exposure of the eyes to infrared rays can also cause cataracts and scotoma. This is mostly for those who work with fire or glass workers. Wearing blue or green glasses can absorb infrared rays and avoid diseases caused by infrared rays.

In our lives, we are constantly in contact with sunlight and need sunlight all the time. Therefore, we cannot but pay attention to the hygiene of sunlight. We should often exercise in the sun, take sunbaths more often, and ensure that sunlight directly shines into our houses. Open the windows every day to allow sunlight to directly shine into the room to kill microorganisms. It is best to live in a place that is not low-lying, and the surroundings should have ample opportunities to receive sunlight. There should be adequate light when working, and the light should not be too weak or too strong. Shaking can damage eyesight. If you enjoy excessive sunlight, you should consider the age and apply it correctly to avoid damaging tissues and cells. When operating or walking in the open air in summer, wear a ventilated hat to prevent sunlight from directly shining on the head. When taking a sunbath, be sure to cover the head, and the time should not be too long. All these things need to be carefully considered. Although sunlight is beneficial to life, if it is not used properly, it can also be harmful!

### Can Skinny Children Become Fat?

— Qing

"Skinny" is a common problem among children. Generally speaking, "skinny" means malnutrition. This is partly due to constitution, either natural or hereditary. Naturally, it is sometimes a symptom of a systemic disease, and being thin is just one of the symptoms. Some children are born weak or congenitally deficient. Most of their parents are physically weak and underdeveloped, or have tuberculosis or syphilis.

Malnutrition in children is mostly acquired. The main reason is neglecting the rules of daily hygiene or simply not understanding them. This is naturally the fault of the parents. The most important reason is improper diet. The food eaten may be insufficient, may not be suitable for the child's digestive capacity, or may lack the nutrients that children need to grow. For example, many parents let their children eat more meat, noodles, candies, and other such things. In fact, to ensure normal development in children, such foods should be reduced and replaced with milk, green vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Eating snacks, especially sugar and other sweet things, is most likely to cause indigestion, leading to malnutrition. Irregular eating times and insufficient chewing are also important causes of malnutrition.

Three meals a day are suitable for most children. Sometimes, a snack can be added between meals, such as hot soup or milk, bread or dry steamed buns with butter, but not too much. For children in families with heavier burdens, such as those with insufficient economic resources, soy milk can be used instead of milk. In any case, protein must be sufficiently supplied during the child's growth and development.

Being active is a child's nature, and normal activity is of great benefit to a child's physical and mental health. However, strenuous exercise must be prohibited, and there must be adequate rest during the day. Sleep for one or two hours in the middle of the day or afternoon. Go to bed early at night. Some parents often stay up late because of the theater or mahjong, and the children listen and watch, gradually developing bad habits of going to bed late and getting up late, which has a great impact on the physical and mental health of children. Parents must pay attention to correcting this.

In addition, fresh air and outdoor sunshine are also essential.

If the tonsils or adenoids in the throat are enlarged or inflamed, they should be removed. If there are decayed teeth, they should also be repaired or extracted. Whenever any defects or deformities are found in the child's body, they should be corrected immediately.

If parents pay attention to and improve the above points, then their children will definitely not be skinny.

Spring and Autumn

### Village

— Jiang Ye

River

The river flows slowly, flows...

The river is gentle, elegant, and peaceful. The river reflects the lives of the villagers entirely. The river brings happiness to the villagers.

In these hot days, the fields are parched after just a few days without rain. It doesn't matter, put the waterwheel into the river, and after pumping water for a while, the rice in the drought-stricken fields is saved.

The river is the villagers' natural wealth. Simply cast a net and pull it up, and you will find fish and shrimp. Flocks of white geese and mallards forage freely in the river, swimming freely.

The river watches over the village, watching over the lives of the villagers. The years in the village flow like the river, slowly, slowly.

Waterwheel Shed

The waterwheel shed sits idly on the riverbank, at the bend of the river. Beside the waterwheel shed stands a green willow tree.

Praying that God will help. In these hot days, let there be more rain, so that the villagers and livestock can save some energy and no longer have to brave the summer heat to pump water.

The south wind blows the green willow branches, swaying, and it is a good place to cool off in the waterwheel shed.

Wooden Bridge

The wooden bridge spans the river.

The wooden bridge is old and shabby. The wooden bridge has its own past of many hardships.

After dinner, shirtless, fanning a palm-leaf fan, I often come to the bridge with the village children to relax, sitting on the bridge planks, listening to them telling me about the stories they heard from their grandfathers about the bridge.

The villagers love the wooden bridge as they love themselves. The wooden bridge is the passage of the villagers' lives. The wooden bridge is the sympathy and help between the village and the outside world.

Boat

In the morning, it sails to the city, and in the evening, it returns from the city. Returning from the city, it brings various daily necessities, letters, and the day's newspapers.

The boat is the village's messenger, the villagers' great lover.

Small Teahouse

At night, the kerosene lamp is lit in the small teahouse.

At night, the small teahouse is open for business.

Shirtless, with a palm-leaf fan and a yellow tobacco pipe, the villagers all come to the small teahouse to drink tea.

### South Village Tune

— Lü Baihua

The eldest son of Mr. Ma Gongyu, a epigrapher and painter, Da Hui, his second son Da Ren, and his daughter-in-law Wen Guang, all graduated from university and served in the rear for many years. Now they have all been assigned to study in the United States, and will take the "American General" ship to the West on the tenth of the month. I rely on "South Village Tune" to send them off. Playing the flute and tracing Fufeng, the odd number is entirely in the east; I envy Ji Yun's double excellence, at ease! There is also a husband and wife who respect each other. Broad learning requires deep study, it is the prime of life and your ancestry is prospering; Today the flywheel heads west, harmoniously! When the tiger returns, its own energy is strong.

After a hard day's work, they are exhausted. At this moment, they can relax their minds here and take a mental bath.

They drink tea, smoke, and gently fan themselves with palm-leaf fans. They talk about the weather, the year's harvest, and every small thing that happens in the village.

A large moon hangs on the big willow tree in front of the small teahouse, as well as a chorus of cicadas.

### What of Flowers

— Kengqiang

Flower in a Greenhouse

The flower in the greenhouse has bloomed. I saw that it was the florist who forcibly peeled it open. Although the flower is still the same size as usual, its growth is, after all, deformed.

Its branches are soft and curved, like the legs of a child just learning to walk. Its color is also strange, like rouge on a prostitute's face. Although it is bright, it cannot conceal the anemic complexion under the torment of life.

It also has the shame of fearing the sun. Unlike the sunflowers growing in the fields, which dare to face the sun openly and honestly, it is like a new bride afraid of seeing her parents-in-law. Once it sees the sun, it can no longer raise its head.

The flower in the greenhouse has withered again. It blooms silently and withers silently. Who made it so miserable? The feeling of repentance prevents the florist's two fingers from knowing.

Wildflower

In the wilderness, a wildflower blooms stubbornly.

It has no man-made scaffolding to support it, nor any extra leaves to accompany it. It relies only on its own thin stem to stubbornly support it from blooming to withering.

There were such wildflowers on this day last year, but they were later eaten by the plowing cattle. Who would have thought that this stubborn little creature would actually be reborn a year later?

In the wilderness, the wildflower still blooms stubbornly. It is a symbol of the struggle for life!

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

With a small, nimble movement, the spirit of the past, there were two hands stretched out from the outside, simultaneously opening the car door. Inside was the coachman's hand, and outside was the waiter, hurrying up to pull open the car door.

"Did you two come from the station?" the waiter asked Jiang Yaoqun and Little Tiger casually. Only his lips moved, but they were wooden.

"Isn't that right?" Yaoqun replied lazily as she followed Little Tiger out of the car. "Please tell the cashier to issue the fare."

"Yes, you," the waiter took the two small bundles from Little Tiger's hand. "Do you have any large luggage?" The waiter's voice was also wooden, without a trace of inflection. "Perhaps!" Yaoqun mumbled, seemingly intentionally making it difficult to hear clearly.

"Please, you," the waiter asked Yaoqun and Little Tiger to go first. The polite movements and posture were also wooden.

From one perspective, this wooden-type waiter, because he was too wooden, with his expression, tone, and actions all so monotonous, made people feel that this small encounter was too mechanical.

But from another perspective, although his appearance was wooden, it was just a manifestation of restraint. Inside, he seemed frighteningly cold. The wooden component contained extreme nervous tension, as if every nerve was trembling, every muscle cell was quivering, and at the same time, a kind of terrifying experience was forcibly suppressing his nerves and the muscles of his whole body, preventing them from twitching, so there was no expression.

Expression in this "area" is too dangerous. The slightest expression in speech or action is equivalent to revealing one's secrets. The consequences of this leakage are unimaginable. It may lead to three days and three nights of "exhausting interrogation," it may lose this slave-like "freedom," and be detained for three months, half a year, or even ten or eight years. It may be subjected to torture, whipping, waterboarding, electrocution, hanging...

The waiter's actions seemed contagious. Yaoqun, who was originally somewhat reserved, deepened her level of restraint immediately upon seeing the waiter's actions. Little Tiger, who had thought he had arrived at his destination in the car, had become somewhat active, but after being hit by the waiter's cold air, the happiness he had prepared was immediately frozen.
