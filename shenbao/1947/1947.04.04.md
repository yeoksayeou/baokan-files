According to aerial reconnaissance, the main force of the Communist Army in the Yimeng Mountains has been moving northeast in recent days.

Most of the Communist Army is currently concentrated in Xintai, Laiwu, Zichuan, Boshan, and the mountainous areas of Southern and Central Shandong, hiding during the day and coming out at night to avoid decisive battles with the main force.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] The National Army corps north and south of Tai'an, on the 3rd, continued to mop up along the Jinpu Railway, with Tai'an as the center.

However, since the Yellow River water has returned to its old course, they dared not cross south, so they fled along the north bank of the Yellow River towards northern Henan and joined forces with the Communist Army in the Taihang Military Region, threatening the central section of the Pinghan Railway. The military here saw through their conspiracy and made an accurate estimate of the strength of the Liu Bocheng remnants. They made leisurely deployments, and on the evening of the 1st, the Communist Army launched fierce attacks on Jixian and the bridgehead positions of the National Army at the northern end of the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Fierce fighting continued throughout the night until the morning of the 2nd, and they were all repelled, with two regimental commanders and three battalion commanders killed or wounded.

The US troops mentioned therein have, during the period covered by these reports, provided significant assistance in repatriating nearly three million Japanese from China as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement and the Instrument of Surrender. I have no information regarding the disposal of nearly 700,000 Japanese in the Northeast who were directly detained by the Soviet Union. On January 29, 1947, the US Government announced its decision to terminate its relationship with the Committee of Three, which was established in Chongqing with the aim of ending the Chinese civil war. It also announced its decision to terminate its relationship with the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation, which was established in Beiping by the Committee of Three with the aim of supervising the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and military reorganization. The US government also issued a statement regarding the withdrawal of the US Marine Corps, whose mission was to ensure the safety of the US personnel of the Executive Headquarters for Military Mediation and to maintain communication between the Headquarters and Haikou. This action has greatly reduced the number of US Army and Navy personnel required in China, and withdrawals will continue as shipping becomes available. Upon completion of the current drawdown (estimated to be June 1, 1947), the US Army and Navy personnel remaining in China at the request of the Chinese National Government will number 6,180, roughly distributed as follows: US Army 1,510, including a advisory group of 750, 351 protecting US property and offices, 160 in air transport, 94 in the accounting office, and 155 various staff members.

### Shang Zhen Returns to Country, Arrives in Shanghai, Scheduled to go to Capital Today to Await Audience with Chairman to Report on Duties, Denies Will Be Appointed Head of Military Mission to Japan

[Reported by this Newspaper] General Shang Zhen, Chief of Staff of the National Government and Deputy Head of the Chinese Military Delegation to the United Nations, flew to London from Chongqing in January last year and then went to Washington to attend the United Nations Military Delegation meeting. Recently, he was summoned back to China by Chairman Chiang via telegram, departing from the United States on the "American Magic" General vessel on the 8th of last month with his staff, Colonel Yang Youmei and Lieutenant Colonel Yao Shaorong. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The "American Magic" docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf at 10:30 AM yesterday. Among those who went to welcome him were Zhang Peter, representing Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan Tiewu, Ding Guitang, Deputy Chief of the Jianghai Customs, Ma Deji, Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and Wang Zhuyi, Secretary-General of the National Diplomatic Association, as well as several dozen others. The National Government's Military Staff Office also specially sent Staff Officer Gong Lizhao and others to Shanghai to greet him.

### Remarks by Mr. Shang

General Shang, wearing the uniform of an Army General, shook hands with the welcomers after disembarking and then went to Room 603 of the International Hotel to rest. Mr. Shang immediately met with reporters from various newspapers, expressing his views on his trip abroad and the progress of the meeting. According to him, the United Nations Military Delegation is jointly composed of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, with the aim of promoting communication among countries after the war to seek lasting world peace. The delegation is currently discussing the principles and methods of organizing an international army, mainly to organize and train international forces so that they can guarantee peace by force if the United Nations cannot impose sanctions. After Mr. Shang returns to China, General He Yingqin, the head of the Chinese Military Delegation to the United Nations, will continue to participate in the meeting.

Mr. Shang also stated that the American people are extremely concerned about the situation in China, and they all believe that the US government should lend out the $500 million loan as soon as possible to help revive China's industry and commerce.

Mr. Shang expressed great admiration when discussing the post-war demobilization situation in Britain and the United States. He said that the United States has recovered more quickly after the war because it was not directly damaged during the war. However, the demand for the automotive industry is very large, and supply cannot yet meet demand, so export restrictions are quite strict. The United Kingdom has implemented a strict rationing system after the war, and the entire country is united in its hard work and endurance, without any black market situation; the Labour government is also helping people solve housing shortages and medical difficulties.

Since the Chairman went to Fenghua to sweep the tombs, and Commander Xuan was specially ordered by the Chairman to inform Mr. Shang that he did not need to go to Fenghua, and if he wanted to stay in Shanghai for a while, he could rest for a few days before going to the capital. Therefore, he does not intend to go to Fenghua and plans to go to the capital today to report on his duties after the Chairman returns.

In addition, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and several local leaders and government officials of this city visited Mr. Shang successively yesterday afternoon.

It is rumored that after Mr. Shang returns to China, he will be appointed as the head of the Chinese Military Delegation to Japan, but Mr. Shang denied this.

### Another Japanese Drug Manufacturing Case Cracked in Changchun: Main Culprits, Yamauchi, Morimoto, and Others Apprehended

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 3rd] Judging from the more than ten major drug manufacturing and trafficking cases announced by the police bureau in this city since nearly April, Changchun City seems to have become a base for unscrupulous elements among the more than 1,400 Koreans residing here to manufacture and traffic drugs.

### Is Life Meaningless? 17-Year-Old Boy in Beiping Commits Suicide by Poisoning, Abruptly Taking His Life After Playing "May Breeze"

[Reported by this Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] A suicide case occurred in the Beijing Hotel the day before yesterday. The deceased seemed to hear the call of the god of death in the music of "May Breeze" and returned to his room to poison himself. The details are as follows: At 10:00 AM on the 1st, a young man came to the Beijing Hotel to check in, dressed luxuriously. He booked Room 120 and filled in the hotel register as Cai Zhong, 17 years old, from Guangzhou, residing at No. 15, Yongyixing, Xiaoxijie, Tanggu. The young man entered the room, rested briefly, and then went to the auditorium to play the piano. His tone was euphemistic and seemed to be proficient in music. When he played the popular song "May Breeze," the sound touched his emotions, so he left his seat and returned to his room. The next morning at 8:00 AM, the tea boy asked him for the owed sugar fee and pushed the door but it would not open. Knowing that something was wrong, he opened the window of the room and saw a small square table propping up the door. An empty box of anarcol (a strong sleeping pill) was found next to the bed. He then learned that he had taken poison and was sent to the Third Municipal Hospital, but he eventually died due to the prolonged time of poisoning. A suicide note was also found in the room, nearly a thousand words long, stating in brief: "The main reason for my suicide is indeed my ideological problem." "The current me thinks that life is absolutely meaningless, I can't find out why?" "We are born in the sea of people, just a grain of sand in the desert, a drop of water in the ocean, too small! When I heard the song May Breeze, I felt infinite disappointment and negativity." (The whole book is full of poetry)

### Children's Day and New Children's Enterprises

— Hu Shuyi

Today, we joyfully celebrate the 16th Children's Day of the Republic of China. The author was one of the first to advocate for Children's Day and participate in the Central Children's Year Implementation Committee. Looking back and forward, I feel that celebrating Children's Day should start with practically advocating for children's enterprises. Now, on this extremely memorable day, let's review this point:

Thanks to the progress of scientific research in psychology, physiology, education, etc., in modern times, people with knowledge have begun to value children and have established a belief that children themselves have value. In addition, the lessons of two World Wars have taught us that manpower is a prerequisite for winning everything, so all countries cherish their children. The fact that all countries have Children's Day and children's protection regulations can serve as evidence. Speaking of our country, just look at the history of the birth of Children's Day, and everyone knows that Shanghai is the birthplace of Children's Day in the Republic of China. More than ten years ago, the China Children's Welfare Association, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee, and other groups, had indelible advocacy achievements. At that time, a group of progressive industrial and commercial people in Shanghai rose up to support this very meaningful Children's Day and founded various children's enterprises. As far as I know, various newspapers have children's weeklies, and merchants have founded children's toy factories, children's clothing companies, etc., all of which were established after the government stipulated Children's Day and Children's Year. Even the Children's Bookstore, which specializes in spiritual food for children, although established in advance, has expanded and developed because of this! This is also a fact! Then, children's undertakings across the country sprang up like mushrooms after a rain. This very much proves that after Children's Day became a social movement, it has shifted the business policies of the industrial and commercial circles to children. Now let's talk about the United Kingdom and the United States. In their societies, you can often see the world of children. In terms of municipal construction alone, their goal is to consider adults on the one hand, and also take into account the welfare of children. For example, children's parks, children's playgrounds, children's libraries, children's hospitals, children's laboratories, children's theaters, etc., are all planned and gradually realized one by one. In the United States, there is a private enterprise called the National Boys' Club. This community is a social organization. The headquarters is located in New York, and branches are located in various states. Approximately each branch has between one hundred and ten thousand child members. The purpose of the association is to provide various activities that are beneficial to the physical and mental health of children, so that children can gain various cultivations in terms of physical health, mental health, career, and social interaction. The people who founded and presided over the association are all local people who are enthusiastic about children's undertakings, and the funds mainly come from donations. The headquarters also hires experts to go to various branches to inspect and guide, plan everything, and improve the direction of activities. The effect is no less than that of primary and secondary school education. This is worth emulating. In addition, the two major new enterprises of children's movies and children's radio also need to be established on a large scale. In big cities, the objective conditions for electrical education are relatively complete. After the war, the urban population is dense and buildings are scarce. This new tool of electrical education is even more needed to make up for the lack of space and time in school education, to move the teaching materials to the screen, or to broadcast the teaching process in space. By closely coordinating these two things, a large number of children can enjoy more convenient education anytime and anywhere. In short, this new tool of electrical education can expand the field and facilities of education. Therefore, the organization of electrical education is the newest type of children's enterprise. In the United States and the United Kingdom, most of these enterprises are private, and they are working hard to promote them under the conditions of government sponsorship and commercial competition; and in terms of quality, they are becoming more and more perfect, which is even more worth emulating.

Shanghai is the birthplace of Children's Day in the Republic of China. Wise and progressive industrialists and businesspeople have a correct understanding of new children's enterprises. In the past, they have had some brilliant achievements. In the history of the development of children's enterprises in our country, it inspires us to trust even more that Shanghai will never lag behind. On the occasion of Children's Day in the second year of victory, with all construction making strides forward, the author sincerely hopes that in the birthplace of Children's Day, a promotion campaign will be launched for the above-mentioned two major new children's enterprises. In the program of next year's Children's Day celebration, there will be countless aerial children's schools, broadcast celebration programs, and countless children's educational films or teaching materials, which will be shown in various schools and plazas in rotation. This is what must be advocated and realized as soon as possible in today's celebration.

Modern advanced countries all believe that the construction and promotion of children's welfare undertakings cannot achieve unity and macro-efficiency without establishing an organization that is a research hub. Therefore, in major cities, there are often organizations such as children's bureaus and children's welfare committees, which are responsible for dealing with unruly children and providing relief to poor children, which is the responsibility of the local government. The author believes that our authorities also consider this point, which is not only good news for children, but also great fortune for the nation and the country!

### The Issue of German Political Organization Handed Over to the Adjustment Committee for Handling The Four Foreign Ministers Have Reached an Agreement in Principle The United States and the Soviet Union May Reach a Compromise on the Issue of German Reparations

[French News Agency, Moscow, 2nd] The Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the issue of the political organization of Germany on Thursday and reached an agreement in principle, advocating that the political organization of Germany be divided into four stages: (1) Establishment of a central administrative agency; (2) Establishment of an advisory committee; (3) Formulation of a provisional constitution and establishment of a provisional government; (4) Drafting of the German constitution. However, the representatives of the various countries still had very different opinions on other issues. U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall proposed that the matter be handed over to the Allied Control Council in Berlin for handling, but was rejected by the representatives of the various countries. Subsequently, British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed that the matter be handed over to the Adjustment Committee for sorting out, and then submitted a report to the Council of Foreign Ministers. This proposal was immediately adopted by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers.

[This newspaper] San Francisco, 3rd Broadcast: Marshall recently announced in Moscow that the U.S. is willing to consider a compromise plan on the issue of German reparations, in other words, the U.S. agrees to obtain limited reparations from Germany's current production.

[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] The United States is preparing to compromise with the Soviet Union at the meeting of the four powers today. According to authoritative sources, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall has prepared a compromise proposal on the issue of German reparations, that is, to accept the principle of extracting reparations from Germany's current production after the German economy has reached a self-sufficient basis. It is said that Marshall is willing to reveal this plan at today's meeting, and may subsequently disclose it publicly. It is understood that the plan includes: (1) Making some decisions on the improvement of the German industrial level, which will make the number of German factories that can be moved for reparations according to the Potsdam method smaller; (2) Marshall will allow the extraction of some production from the few factories that remain unmoved for reparations, due to the higher level of the German industrial plan; (3) Marshall will insist that Germany should reach a self-sufficient basis in terms of necessary imports before the extraction of reparations, and should repay the expenses used by the Allies to prevent Germany from starvation so far.

[This newspaper] Moscow, 4th Broadcast: The Four-Power Foreign Ministers have been exhibiting for several weeks since the opening, and due to differences of opinion, there have been no achievements. Now it is nearing the end. The British and French sides expect the meeting to end on the 13th, while the U.S. delegation said that it will not be able to close until the 15th at the earliest. Marshall's position is still strong, secretly sending the message that this meeting will fail, and he will never make concessions to the Soviet Union. The British and French foreign ministers expressed concern about this, and they believe that if they return home empty-handed, they will not be able to cope with their respective parties. Among them, the position of French Foreign Minister Bidault is even more difficult. When the Council of Foreign Ministers meets today, it will discuss key issues such as eliminating the Nazis and democratizing Germany.

### Two Wartime Agreements Cause Major Disputes

[United Press, Moscow, 2nd] The current efforts of the Council of Foreign Ministers to reach an agreement have been greatly complicated by the two agreements of Potsdam and Yalta. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall publicly admitted that although the foreign ministers are now trying to consult in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, they have long known that the loose and ambiguous wording of the Potsdam Declaration is easy to produce various completely different interpretations. For each country, the agreement is almost one saying per person. The four major countries have all cited the agreement to prove that they are right and to criticize others. Marshall once said, "For the Soviet Union, the Potsdam Agreement stipulates various reparations worth tens of billions of dollars, and it can extract reparations from Germany's current production. For the United States and Britain, the Potsdam Agreement does not stipulate that reparations should be extracted from current production, and the number of tens of billions of dollars in the Yalta Agreement has become invalid. For Britain and the Soviet Union, the Potsdam Agreement stated that the German central agency should be presided over by Germans, but for France, the agreement only stated that a central agency should be established under the control of the four powers. France still has many different understandings of the timing and manner of establishing a central agency in Germany, and as a result, Germany cannot have economic unity. The Soviet Union believes that the merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany violates the agreement and should be stopped. Britain and the United States believe that this merger is within the scope of the agreement. For generations to come, all parties will point to any point in the Potsdam and Yalta agreements as clear evidence of the other country's breach of faith. Therefore, unless we can truly confer wholeheartedly and truly want to fulfill the words and spirit of the agreement, it is better to have no agreement." Judging from Marshall's statement that he is not in a hurry to make a hasty decision, it is enough to know that he will avoid repeating the mistakes of shoddy work.

### Clay Returns to Berlin

[French News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] General Clay, the commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, returned to Berlin from Moscow today to defend the decision. Clay was originally summoned to the Soviet Union to participate in the discussion of the report of the Allied Control Council, but now that the discussion is practically over, he has returned to Germany. It is said that if Marshall needs him, he can come to Moscow.

### Molotov Receives South Korean Deputy Prime Minister

[French News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Gategi and South Korean Foreign Minister Simic last night. Yugoslav Ambassador to the Soviet Union Babovic was also present.

### British Factories Plan to Move to Australia The Relocation Time Will Take Twenty Years

[United Press, Canberra, 2nd] Australian Prime Minister Chifley announced today that the British government plans to gradually move various industries to Australia, and the relocation time will take twenty years. At the same time, British manufacturers also plan to establish branches and affiliated businesses in Australia.

### The Soviet Union Recalls Its Ambassador to Greece A Prelude to the Severance of Diplomatic Relations Between the Soviet Union and Greece

[Reuters, Athens, 2nd] The Soviet Union has already recalled its ambassador to Athens, Rodionov. It is generally believed that this is the first step the Soviet Union will take to sever diplomatic relations with Greece in order to implement a foreign school counter-offensive after President Truman announced his plan to aid Greece and Turkey. Rodionov is scheduled to leave Greece with all the staff of the embassy on Friday. He visited the Greek foreign minister today to ask him to issue exit passports. People at the Soviet embassy here, in addition to confirming Rodionov's trip, were unwilling to reveal whether he would never return. The diplomatic community here was surprised by Rodionov's sudden return home, and there has been no response from the authorities so far. According to reports, Rodionov left Athens for the Soviet Union on August 31 last year.

[French News Agency, Turkish Capital, 2nd] Turkish Prime Minister Baker delivered an important speech in Izmir (formerly Smyrna) today, expounding Turkey's foreign policy and emphasizing Turkey's friendship with Britain and the United States. His speech roughly stated: The alliance between Britain and Turkey is still strong and sincere, and we must not forget the significant impact this alliance has had on our lives recently. As for the relations between the United States and Turkey, they are also based on the same status. The United States' friendship with Turkey is very strong, and it is expanding its effective assistance. The policy adopted by Turkey is completely based on Western democracy. As the Prime Minister of Turkey, although I have to say this, I still want to point out that I do not harbor any emotions of hostility towards the Soviet Union.

In fact, the Turkish army was working hard to prevent the German army from landing in Turkey, and the Soviet Union also expressed its agreement to this.

### Beijing-Shanghai Line Open, Interrupted for Nine Hours, Fourth-Class Passenger Train Derails at Lingkou, Passengers and Goods Fortunately Safe

The 58th train from Shanghai to Beijing derailed near Danyang the day before yesterday, causing all trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line to be suspended yesterday morning. A large number of spring tourists and people going to Beijing were stranded, unable to advance or retreat, and were extremely anxious. The track was repaired at 10:15 AM on the same day, and the Jinling special train at 1:30 PM was able to depart on time. According to reports, the 58th train was a fourth-class passenger train, towed by locomotive P-538. In addition to passengers, it also carried many freight cars. It departed from Shanghai Station at 5:20 PM on the 2nd. At 1:22 AM that night (i.e., yesterday morning), it arrived at Lingkou Station near Danyang. When the locomotive and the rear passenger car entered the east branch line, the locomotive suddenly derailed completely at the frog of the branch line, and the front two wheels of the first passenger car were also pulled off the track. Fortunately, the driver acted quickly and braked immediately, so the train body did not overturn, and there were no casualties or losses of passengers and goods. However, because the track and sleepers were severely damaged, it was difficult to repair them urgently, and the damaged area was located at the branch line switch, so the 9th and 11th passenger trains from Beijing to Shanghai were blocked and unable to pass. The 6th and 8th passenger trains from Shanghai to Beijing were also unable to depart because there were no cars to transfer them. After the accident, the stationmaster of Lingkou Station immediately telegraphed the Shanghai Railway Bureau to report, and also telegraphed the Qishuyan Changzhou Locomotive Depot, together with the police, car, and engineering sections along the line, to rush to repair. In order to facilitate passengers on the line, the two railway bureaus also added two shuttle trains at 9:30 AM and 10:30 AM on the same morning, with Wuxi as the terminus. The track damage at Lingkou Station was completely repaired at 10:15 AM after hard work, and the Jinling sightseeing train to Beijing at 1:30 PM was able to depart on time. The 9th and 11th trains stranded at Lingkou Station arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM and 5:00 PM, respectively. However, the Qiantang sightseeing train, originally scheduled to depart at 4:00 PM, was delayed until 6:00 PM due to a conflict in car delivery time. As for the cause of the derailment, according to Chen Shuyi, the general stationmaster of the Railway Bureau in Shanghai, most locomotive derailments are caused by the following four reasons: (1) soft road (i.e., track tilting), (2) excessive speed, (3) switchman not correcting the switch, and (4) other accidents. However, the Railway Bureau has not yet received a report and is conducting a thorough investigation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The 58th Beijing-Shanghai fourth-class slow train, which departed from Shanghai to Beijing at 5:40 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, had a locomotive wheel suddenly derail at 1:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd when passing the east branch of Lingkou Station between Danyang and Zhenjiang. With a loud bang, the entire locomotive immediately derailed, and two passenger cars were also pulled out and overturned. According to the Lingkou Station's investigation report, the right track of the road had lost its toughness, and the two tracks could not be balanced, causing the disaster. This morning, trains between Beijing and Shanghai could only reach around Zhenjiang. The 90th and 2nd passenger trains from Beijing were not dispatched. At 11:00 AM, in order to solve the crowding of passengers, Beijing added a temporary shuttle train between Beijing and Zhenjiang. It was restored in the afternoon. All trains were delayed.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 3rd] At about 1:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the 58th fourth-class passenger train from Shanghai to Beijing on the Beijing-Shanghai line suddenly had a section of the rail damaged and cracked when passing through Lingkou Station between Danyang and Changzhou, causing the passenger car to overturn. Fortunately, the driver immediately tried to stop the train. Only the locomotive derailed, and the passengers were not injured. It was repaired and opened to traffic at about 12:00 noon. The cause of the crack is currently being investigated.

### The Truth About Yuan Xinpei's Kidnapping: Architect Colludes with Military Personnel to Commit Crimes, Captain Tang Has Been Detained

[Our Report] The North Station Police Precinct captured four kidnappers, including Zhang Tigong, at the intersection of Chongqing Road and Zhongzheng Road the day before yesterday, as reported in this newspaper. It is learned that the case also involves a captain of a certain military organ in the city, Tang Yuyuan. Yesterday, Tang was detained by his superiors. The victim in this case was Yuan Xinpei. At about 8:00 PM on the 23rd of last month, five armed soldiers and one man each in a suit and a gown, riding in two cars, arrived at Yuan's residence at 18 Hengji Lane, Qipu Road. After they disliked opening the door, they claimed to be checking for drugs. They found a Shuanglong brand morphine trademark in a Japanese version and a small packet of morphine, and then extorted 80 million yuan. That night, because Yuan only had several hundred thousand in cash at home, Yuan was kidnapped and driven away, hidden on the fifth floor of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Middle Road. That evening, Yuan's concubine, Jin, in order to rescue her husband, opened a room at the Dongya Hotel, No. 332, to negotiate with them. As a result, the ransom was reduced from 80 million to 30 million yuan, but because there was no such huge amount of cash, it was not paid. By the next morning, Yuan repeatedly called home five times: (1) "I am safe outside, don't worry." (2) He asked his son to borrow 3 million yuan from Yongsheng Ironworks on Zhejiang Road. (3) He also asked to increase it by 1 million yuan. (4) He said that after the money was ready, it should be placed at the entrance of Yongsheng Ironworks. (As a result, no one came to inquire.) (5) He told his family that he had been released. At that time, the Haizhu Road Jiangxi Road Inspection Brigade had reported the case and joined forces with the North Station Police Precinct to investigate. It was learned that the main culprit in this case was Zhang Tigong, a well-known figure in Xincheng District, an architect, who had colluded with Tang Yuyuan, the captain of a certain military organ, and others to commit the crime. That night, Tang Yuyuan personally led four inspectors and Zhang and seven others to kidnap Yuan Xinpei. The next afternoon, an inspector escorted Yuan to a bank to withdraw 10 million yuan before releasing Yuan. Zhang Tigong later received 2 million yuan in cash and 120 US dollars. Stone Stock, the head of the North Station Police Bureau, learned the situation and found out that the main culprit, Zhang Tigong, lived at No. 23 Chongqing Road, had officers accompanying him, and was extravagant. Captain Tang also frequented the place. The officers disguised themselves and waited, and monitored Zhang's actions for four days and nights. Before dawn, they learned that Qiang Jie was fleeing to another place, and hired a friend's Ning car company to send a car to the North Station. The people in the car were Tang Guixiang, Zai Shifu, and He Jinbiao. The performers waiting near Chongqing Road waited for them to get on the car, stopped the car, and arrested all four criminals, including Zhang Tigong.

It is also learned that when the police officers fired their guns to stop the car, a stray bullet accidentally injured the driver of the dispatched car, Ji Xingsheng. Fortunately, the bullet hit his shoulder, and the injury was slight, so there was no major problem.

### The Tragically Deceased Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine Shows Signs of Being Murdered: No Water in Abdomen, Scars on Body, Re-Examine the Body to Ascertain the Truth

[Our Report] On the morning of the 23rd of last month, a male floating corpse was found at Pier 13 of the Bund. The deceased was identified as Zheng Zongjing, who lived at 12 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, and worked as a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine. It was also verified that the corpse had three scars on his neck and minor injuries on his face. There was no swelling of the abdomen due to water entering, which seemed to indicate that he had been murdered and thrown into the river. According to the deceased's family, on the afternoon of March 21, Zheng Zongjing was invited out for "tea" due to a housing dispute with the second landlord, Shao Kunshan, and never returned. They also said that the second landlord, Shao Kunshan, also known as Shao Sanmazi, had considerable potential influence in the nearby area. Therefore, the police had summoned and investigated him. According to Shao, Zheng may have committed suicide due to economic pressure and had nothing to do with him. Fang Zheng, the on-duty prosecutor of the District Procuratorate, and forensic doctor Yi Ziwei, specially went to re-examine Zheng's corpse yesterday to prove whether he had been killed before his death or committed suicide by drowning.

### Messberg on Trial Again for Illegal Trading of Gold, Banknotes, and Foreign Exchange, Defendant Stenographer Requests Verification of Testimony, Mrs. Bao Flies from Beiping to Shanghai to Testify

[Our Report] After the government promulgated emergency economic measures, the foreign company Abas was involved in illegal buying and selling of foreign exchange and foreign currency, disrupting the financial case. The court reopened the trial again at 2:00 PM yesterday. "Foreign Tiger" Messberg and other relevant witnesses were summoned to the court. The Dutch Consul General Mittbourg and the Embassy Counselor Yang Yunsan also attended the hearing. According to Yang's statement to reporters: Regarding Messberg's detention, the Dutch Embassy formally protested to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs a few days ago. However, after the trial yesterday, the court still refused to release him on bail. As soon as President Meng Tingke finished asking the defendant's age and place of origin, the defendant's defense lawyer, Chen Tingrui, stood up and

declared four points: (1) During the previous hearing, many economic terms in the testimony of the defendant and witnesses were mistranslated during translation. It is requested that the record be translated into English by the defense lawyer and checked with the defendant. If there are any errors, a correction should be made. (2) The testimony of the witnesses should also be translated into English so that the defendant can understand. (3) Please allow the defendant to prepare more detailed accounts for comparison with the accounts prepared by accountant Xie. (4) The 38 gold bars seized were indeed deposited by Tianjin customers. There is now a telegram from Tianjin Linxing Company that can prove it, and Kang Pace, the safe deposit box manager of Abas Company, is in court, and the court can

summon him to testify. President Meng continued to question the defendant Messberg. According to the testimony: The numbers of telegraphic transfers and mail transfers listed in accountant Xie's audit report are generally consistent and can be agreed. Abas Company mainly deals in telegraphic transfers, with very few cash transactions. After February 17, it only sold 1,839 US dollars in spot, and paid out legal tender in Shanghai after placing telegraphic transfers in New York. There was a deposit of 20,000 yuan in Hong Kong dollars, and no more was done. Gold was purchased from the United States, sold in Hong Kong, and not done in Shanghai. As for the safe deposit boxes in the company, they are all for the safekeeping of customers' items. Kang Pace

knows the details. According to Kang Pace: 53 years old, Portuguese, an employee of Abas Company, responsible for managing the safe deposit boxes. According to his memory, the company has a total of 53 safe deposit boxes, which are not rented out and are all used by the company to keep its own items, but he also said that some of them are also used by customers and company employees to deposit property. When asked about the witnesses Pabotesito (bookkeeper), Potria (auditor), Shao Shunqin (bookkeeper), and Shi Jiusen (cashier), all four denied that there were any gold transactions after February 17. The 1,839 US dollars were also sold by Japanese people. The court then interrogated Kang Pace and questioned the 38 gold bars.

When asked who they belonged to, he said: They were entrusted to him by broker Chen Xiexin. At the same time, there were also 11,211 US dollars, which Chen also entrusted to him on behalf of Tianjin Lin and Company. He also said that Chen Xiexin is now in court. President Meng then summoned Chen to testify. According to Chen: He used to work for Xinfeng Bank (opened in the same place as Abas Company), and is now a broker. Around September 20 last year, Tianjin Linxing Company telegraphed Xinfeng to sell a batch of government bonds. After the sale, the funds were entrusted to him to purchase gold and US dollars in half. Because Chen and Kang were very close friends, he entrusted Kang Pace to keep them. At that time, the gold bars were

sealed with paper, and the word "wait" was signed on it in red and green pencils. At the same time, the gold was not owned by Linxing Company itself, but was entrusted by Mrs. Bao from the client. He also said that Mrs. Bao had specially traveled from Beiping to Shanghai and asked the court to summon her. At this time, Zhang Yamin, the leader of the Garrison Command team attending the hearing, suddenly stood up and pointed at Chen Xiexin and said: When he was ordered to search Sassoon Building on March 3, this person was also present and said that he had nothing to do with the company. The court also summoned Mrs. Bao (Yun of Bao Xingcha, manager of Siemens Foreign Bank in Tianjin), saying that she was 66 years old, from Wuxian. When the government froze foreign exchange, she entrusted Wang Dongju, the manager of the Foreign Exchange Department of the Tianjin Zhongnan Bank, to buy it on her behalf.

It is stored in Shanghai with a bearer code sheet, with which she can come to Shanghai to collect it. She also said that half of it belongs to the old lady Guo, and presented her plane ticket stub and vaccination certificate to prove that she had indeed come from Beiping. Prosecutor Quan Tao stood up and said: Abas Company has more than 90 billion yuan in funds and is the main culprit in this gold rush. He requested strict handling.

[Our Report] Shi, the head of the Laoza Police Precinct, received a secret report a month ago stating that there was a large-scale drug trafficking organization in his jurisdiction. He ordered Jiang Shangpei, the head of the judicial stock, to start an investigation. Zhang Kuilian, Chen Jun'an, Wang Congzhou, Yang Zhongmin, Li Junkun and other officers were dispatched to disguise themselves and distribute themselves in the Jingdong Lane area of Guangxi Road to investigate. They finally arrested Qian Jinsheng and Ju Shaoqing at the entrance of the lane at 2:00 PM one day and brought them to the precinct for interrogation. They learned that the heroin den was located in Room 414 of the Wugong Hotel on Fujian Road. They went to the place to search and continued to arrest Zhang Jinshan and He Sishi. Later, they searched a can of heroin weighing one tael and 13 small packets of morphine at the bottom of the dressing table in the room. Police officers waited for a long time and successively arrested 12 men and women, including Wang Zhangle and others. They also found a letter written by the main culprit, Chen Hongyuan, and learned of the communication addresses: (1) No. 260, Dongfang Hotel, (2) No. 4, Jingqin Lane, (3) No. 3, Weishui Lane, Guangxi Road. Later, the police officers went to Dongfang No. 26 to wait for Chen. He arrived and was arrested. They also found three taels of heroin under the bed and brought them to the precinct. He confessed that he had purchased it from Cao Meiquan, the king of heroin. Each transaction was conducted in the dance hall tea room. Cao was still on the second floor of the Xinya Tea Room. The officers in charge rushed to catch Cao's wife, Jin Nv, and Chen's wife, He, while Cao had left. They also learned that Cao had a mistress, Chen Guoying, who lived at No. 1 Baoyuan Lane, Qingyun Street, Nanshi. As a result, Cao was arrested in the box room on the second floor. At that time, a square stool was found with a hidden drug mechanism inside. They tried to open it and found four taels of heroin inside. Seeing that the secret was revealed, he immediately removed his diamond ring and gold watch chain to bribe them, but they were sternly rejected. Chen Guoying and the maid, Wang Amao, were brought to the precinct at the same time. They confessed that the sources of drugs were in three places: (1) Wu Tonghai at No. 68, Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, (2) Xu Xiaokai, Zhi Telephone No. 34933, (3) Zhang Zhengyu at No. 404, Zhongnan Hotel. They successively arrested Wu Tonghai, as well as Zhan Decheng and Zhan's wife, Wang, at No. 69, Anshang Hotel, Yunnan South Road, Wei Shaochu and Wang Defu at Chunjiang Hotel, and Tang Chengxuan and Zhang Shi at Zhongnan Hotel. They went to Xu Xiaokai's residence and learned that it was at Room 24, No. 8, Lane 53, Seymour Road. When they went to arrest him, they only caught the drug dealer Xu Ruiqi. In addition, they also found Gu and others in Xiangkang Lane, Meibaige Road. A total of more than 20 people have been arrested in this case and will be sent to the court for trial.

### Lu Xin Tobacco Factory Striked Yesterday, Li Xin Factory Applied for Closure

[Our Newspaper's Report] The workers of Lu Xin Tobacco Factory went on strike yesterday due to disputes over differential pay, etc. The Social Bureau is currently persuading them to resume work.

The workers of Shen He Rubber Factory went on strike a few days ago because the company owed them three months' salary. The Social Bureau persuaded them yesterday and instructed the company to issue the salaries as soon as possible. The workers resumed work yesterday.

The workers of the old Western clothing industry submitted a petition to the Social Bureau, stating that most employers refused to issue differential pay and requested an order to issue it.

Li Xin Dyeing and Weaving Factory was established last year in April. Due to poor business at the end of the lunar year, some workers were laid off, leaving 56 employees. Now, due to unsustainable operations, they have submitted a petition to the Social Bureau requesting permission to close down and dismiss all workers.

Jiu Xin, Yong Xing, Yuan Xin, Guang Hua, Yi Feng Ying and five other bleaching and raising factories jointly stated to the Social Bureau: After the cost of living index was settled in January, the factories automatically increased the salaries of their employees, which is estimated to be 10,000 times the current cost of living index. However, the employees are still demanding differential pay. Please make a decision. It is reported that the Social Bureau will order the factories to calculate employee salaries based on the cost of living index in January and issue the differential pay accordingly.

### Merchants Excuse Not Keeping Accounts, Decided to Be Treated as Attempting to Evade Taxes

[Our Newspaper's Report] For the winter business tax of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946) for various businesses in this city, the Finance Bureau has been sending out declaration forms to each household since March 17, setting a deadline for submission. However, the Finance Bureau recently discovered that some small and medium-sized stores claimed that their organization was simple and did not establish accounting books, so the declaration forms could not be filled out and requested to reissue estimated declaration forms. The Finance Bureau believes that this action is suspected of attempting to evade taxes. A notice was issued yesterday to strictly correct this situation. In the future, all businesses, except those with legal books, must prepare a daily log and ledger to record the inflow and outflow of money and goods for inspection by the responsible collection agency. The estimated declaration form printed by the Finance Bureau last quarter is a flexible measure during the transition period. Once the bad habit of not keeping accounting books is eradicated, the estimation method will be abolished. Regardless of the size of the store, all should establish accounts. If the declaration form was used to fill out the previous quarter, but the estimated declaration form is requested in the winter under the pretext, it will be regarded as an attempt to evade taxes and will be punished accordingly.

### Another New Initiative by the Post Office: Printing Standard Envelopes, Intending to Invite Students to Serve in Their Spare Time to Help Sort and Press Accumulated Mail

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to save delivery time and improve work efficiency, the Shanghai Post Office has been continuously promoting new measures for several months. After announcing the implementation of the regional delivery system at the end of last month, it is now planning to adopt standard envelopes in the short term. The bureau is currently bidding for printing according to the standard envelope style stipulated by the Post Office Headquarters, and welcomes general printing merchants to imitate it so that citizens can use it universally. According to Wang Yuguang, the assistant to the bureau, the schedules of ships from various countries recently are very abnormal. Sometimes several ships arrive in Shanghai at the same time, with more than thousands of bags of mail. Even in China, because the transportation has not fully returned to normal, similar situations often occur. There is a shortage of postal staff, and it is difficult to sort out these accumulated mails one by one in a short period of time. Therefore, the bureau is currently planning to write to various middle schools to invite students to participate in this temporary mail sorting work in their spare time, and give them appropriate remuneration. Those with excellent performance will be issued certificates of merit. In the future, students who serve and are willing to participate in postal services will be given priority in admission. This is not without the meaning of serving the public on the student's side. In addition, the bureau will also take the method of hiring short-term workers to meet this special need, in order to reduce the difficulty for postal staff to cope with the large number of letters delivered from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. every day.

### Launching a World Children's Mutual Aid Movement: Children Helping Children

— Chen Heqin

Today, I sincerely want to say a few words to teachers and children across the country. During this Normal School Education Movement Week, and as it is also Children's Day, all teachers will surely be thinking about how to educate children. Regarding this issue, I suggest that we, as teachers and parents, initiate a kind of children's education movement—a children's mutual aid movement. We, as teachers, should not only teach children self-reliance but also teach them mutual assistance. How can children help each other?

The eight-year War of Resistance has finally ended. What we urgently expect now is how to establish world peace. The establishment of world peace certainly depends on economic and political issues of all kinds, but it is very important that children worldwide can understand peace and practice mutual assistance.

How can children help each other? I suggest that children in Shanghai take the lead in making a sincere appeal to children across the country and around the world to jointly organize a World Children's Mutual Aid Association. Today, most Chinese children are very unfortunate. They lack food and need help; they lack clothing and need help; and even in terms of cultural knowledge, they need help. Children in the interior, in particular, need help. We can send letters, gifts, and written materials, such as books, to children in the interior to help them understand children in Shanghai. Moreover, we can launch this movement not only to let children in the interior know about the situation of children in Shanghai but also to let children in Shanghai know about the situation of children in the interior; not only to enable children in Shanghai and the interior to understand each other but also to enable children in various places to understand each other; not only to understand the situations of children in various places but also to understand everything in various places. In this way, children's mutual assistance will have a very significant effect. Children in Shanghai and the interior can do this, and children in Shanghai and foreign countries can certainly do this as well.

Recently, my child wrote from the western United States, mentioning that American children are eager to understand Chinese children. However, they are quite unfortunate because there are not many Chinese people there, and no one guides them. Therefore, in their cultural boxes, the items about China include only bound feet shoes, silk fabrics, and some porcelain. Obviously, these things cannot represent today's China. Therefore, it is of great significance to help them understand China.

If every child can donate a little something, then we, the 200,000 children in Shanghai, can create many cultural boxes and send them to American children to help them understand our situation, or send them to Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Not only to European and American countries, but we can also send them to children in Asian countries to let children in India, Burma, and Siam know about Chinese children, and connect Chinese and foreign children. How great would that be!

Recently, we often see in the newspapers reports of anti-Chinese sentiment in Siam, the Philippines, and other places. Why do they discriminate against the Chinese? The reason is that they do not understand the situation in China. If they could understand each other, the problem would definitely be much simpler. Children in Shanghai should quickly organize themselves. We must get in touch with children in India, Burma, Siam, the Philippines, and other countries, and love and help each other. This would definitely make a great contribution to the world peace movement.

The responsibility of teachers is to facilitate children's mutual assistance. We should not only teach one child to be able to help others, but also teach all children to be friendly and helpful. We must enable children in Shanghai to connect with children across the country, and connect with children around the world, to expand the world peace movement. However, how to promote the children's mutual aid movement depends entirely on the efforts of us teachers. Teachers in Shanghai, unite and promote the children's mutual aid movement!

We must enable wealthy children to help poor children, enable children with high levels of education to help children with low levels of education, and enable children in school to help children who are out of school. All of this requires us teachers to initiate. We must know that a teacher's job is not just to teach well, but mainly to teach children to do things themselves. The first major global event after World War II is the world peace movement. Teachers should take responsibility for promoting this movement from Shanghai to various places, and from China to foreign countries. In fact, foreign children have already started mutual aid movements. Two months ago, the children of the attached elementary school of Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School received a cultural box from the children of a school in California, USA. That school had only a few dozen children, but they donated many books to Chinese children. I know that children in other parts of the United States have also sent cultural boxes to children in various countries around the world. Children in Shanghai must not fall behind. We should help each other with children in various parts of the country and with children in various countries around the world!

Taking advantage of this 16th Children's Day, which is also the last day of this year's Normal School Education Movement Week, let us launch a children's mutual aid movement so that children around the world can understand, trust, respect, and help each other. Then, China can achieve lasting peace, and the world can also achieve lasting peace.

### Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Discussion Meeting to Discuss Lowering Oil Prices; Decision to Strengthen Joint Distribution Organization

[Report from this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau convened a discussion meeting at 3:00 pm yesterday with various units in the oil industry to discuss how to lower oil prices and strengthen the joint distribution organization. The meeting began with a report from Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the Food Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, who stated that the highest authorities are extremely concerned about the recent soaring prices of edible oil in the city. Therefore, this meeting was convened to discuss the reasons for the rise in edible oil prices and how to lower them. The lack of control by the joint distribution organization must also be reviewed. A representative of the Oil Pressing Industry Association stated that the cost of raw materials for the oil pressing industry is higher than the price of finished products. Due to the high costs, the association cannot supply edible oil to the joint distribution organization. If the government can supply raw materials, they can process oil on behalf of the government, charging only a low processing fee. Otherwise, the price of distributed oil must be raised. A representative of the joint distribution organization stated that the organization has received a total of more than 16,000 dan of edible oil this year, which is far from the actual required amount. They hope that the supply of edible oil will not be interrupted in the future. After discussions, the following points were agreed upon: (1) Attempts will be made to purchase soybeans from the Northeast Economic Commission to increase the source of raw materials. (2) After the Price Evaluation Committee is established, oil prices will be determined based on costs. (3) The organization of the joint distribution organization will be strengthened, and oil factories should be included to facilitate communication and mutual understanding. (4) The joint distribution organization has more than 1,000 dan of oil that has been allocated but not yet claimed, and efforts will be made to request the Oil Factory Association to supply the oil to clear the backlog.

### Mayor Wu Plans to Stabilize Oil Prices

Mayor Wu, in response to the edible oil problem, specially convened the responsible personnel of major oil factories to inquire about the situation. He also met with President Zhang of the National Bank to discuss ways to thoroughly stabilize oil prices. The principles were decided yesterday: (1) Maximize production, (2) Supply raw materials, (3) Provide loans. The detailed measures will be drafted this afternoon.

### Price Hikes in Production Areas; Rice Grain Sources Decreasing

Yesterday, a total of more than 5,000 shi of rice grain arrived in both the northern and southern markets. Prices in the production areas are gradually increasing, causing distress to consumers.

High-quality white rice has increased by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and indica rice has followed suit, rising by around 3,000 yuan.

Due to high domestic prices, flour sales are brisk, with prices increasing by more than 1,000 yuan. Bran continues to be sold quickly, with prices increasing by 300 to 500 yuan.

### 4,000 Tons of Tung Oil Exported; Prices of New Goods in the Market Decline

[Report from this newspaper] According to a merchant here, recently, the total amount of tung oil exported from Shanghai, as of yesterday, is approximately 4,000 tons, with 3,000 tons of barrelled tung oil exported to Europe and 1,000 tons of bulk tung oil exported to the United States. The aforementioned tung oil was all purchased earlier. Currently, tung oil trade with foreign countries is not possible due to inconsistent prices.

Prices in various production areas are decreasing one after another as new goods enter the market.

### Although There is an Uptrend in Chinese Stocks, Many Investors Remain on the Sidelines

Chinese stocks were stimulated yesterday by news of a thorough investigation of the foreign stock market, and were unusually strong midway through the day. However, due to the fact that investors outside the industry are still on the sidelines, the uptrend could not be sustained, and many retail investors were disappointed. The market became sluggish after being strong in the afternoon, and swap spreads fell from 40 yuan to 30 yuan due to short sellers and banks adding to their short positions, with daily interest rates less than six percent.

The market opened strong, and Diyi Textile quickly rose to 2,480 yuan upon opening. It then slightly declined to 2,330 yuan due to active selling. However, due to the extremely strong trading of Diyi Textile spot goods, No. 185 and others continued to buy, gradually pushing the price up. At 11:15 am, it broke through the 2,500 yuan mark. At this time, China France, Firecrackers, Lian An, and Meya all rose to their limit. No. 104 and No. 215 briefly sold off when prices were high. After 11:45 am, the liquidity of the market decreased, and Diyi Textile rose to a high of 2,570 yuan. Near noon, No. 218 and No. 117 made slight settlements, causing a slight decline. As a result, Xinhe rose by more than 10% compared to the previous close, while Yong Textile, Xinguang, Xinhua, and Huafeng each rose by less than 10%. Meya and China France rose to their limit. In the forward market, Yong Textile, Xinhe, Meya, and Huafeng each rose by slightly more than 10%, Xinguang rose by 10%, cold stocks Lian An, Firecrackers, and Commercial rose to their limit, Datong, Jinglun, and Yonggong each rose by more than 10%, Cement Rongfeng had little trading and remained flat, and the rest rose by varying degrees up to half a percent.

The market was still bullish in the afternoon, with as many as six stocks, including Firecrackers and Meya, rising to their limit. As a result, investors took profits at high prices, and selling suddenly became strong. Rumors that Shanghai would be allocated 90% of the US dollar bonds spread, causing investor sentiment to weaken, and prices fell to 2,435 yuan. However, some people took advantage of the low prices to maintain the market, and prices rebounded to 2,490 yuan. Subsequently, No. 105 and others sold the stock down to around 2,450 yuan. Although No. 171 and others purchased the stock, the market was still overwhelmed by the selling pressure, and Diyi Textile fell to 2,400 yuan. No. 97, No. 117, No. 2, and No. 179 entered the market, and the market slightly rebounded near the close. As a result, Yong Textile and Xinhe rose by about half a percent compared to the previous close. Meya rose by less than 10%, Xinguang, Huafeng, and Xinhua rose slightly, Qinxing remained flat, and China France rose to its limit. In the forward market, Yong Textile and Xinhe rose by more than half a percent, Xinguang and Huafeng rose slightly, Meya rose by less than 10%, cold stocks Commercial, Cement, and Firecrackers rose to their limit and then declined, Lian An rose to its limit, Rongfeng fell by half a percent, and Zhongfang, Tongyi, Jinglun, and Yonggong each rose by more than half a percent. Underwear fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly. All stocks outside the market rose slightly.

### Unified Bonds Trading Sparse

The public bond market yesterday was still lackluster, with a trading volume of less than 5 million yuan. Rooms 512, 555, and 552 were buying, while rooms 551 and 544 were selling. Unified Bond C opened at 11,700 yuan, with a high of 13,200 yuan and a low of 11,500 yuan. The market slightly rebounded near the close, and the results were stable compared to the previous close for all bonds. After the close, prices rebounded to over 13,600 yuan.

### Foreign Stock Market Halted Briefly Due to the Investigation and Confiscation of Intercom Telephones

The foreign stock market was halted briefly yesterday before 11:00 am due to the investigation and confiscation of intercom telephones, which affected the meeting. Trading resumed after the investigators left. Yisha rose from 31,700 yuan to 32,200 yuan, and then fell back to 30,300 yuan before trading sideways. As a result, compared to the previous close, British Union Paper remained flat, and the rest of the stocks had mixed results. Bank stocks were mostly buying, while securities stocks were mostly selling. Rubber stocks were still mostly buying.

### Textile Control Meeting Decides on Two Important Matters: Sets Quotas for Yarn and Cloth Transported South; Approves Payment Methods for Warehouse Rent and Other Expenses

[Report from this newspaper] The 34th regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held at the City Hall at 4:00 pm yesterday. Two important matters were discussed: (1) The February quota for yarn and cloth transported south was approved. The approved quota for yarn and cloth transported south by various manufacturers in February was 3,178 pieces of yarn and 85,251 bolts of cloth. The quota for yarn and cloth transported south under special projects was 2,311 pieces of yarn and 35,287 bolts of cloth. If the remaining quota from February is carried over to March, the total quota for yarn and cloth transported south in March will be 3,550 pieces of yarn and 122,462 bolts of cloth. The total quota for special projects in March is 2,000 pieces of yarn and 85,142 bolts of cloth. Furthermore, regarding the quota for goods transported south set by the meeting, it has been found that a small number of manufacturers are not complying with the regulations and are stamping and certifying the quantity of yarn and cloth transported south for customers, and the quantity sometimes exceeds the regulations, which makes it difficult for the committee to issue permits. After yesterday's discussion, it was requested that the factories no longer exceed the limits, otherwise the factories will be responsible for the consequences. Furthermore, the priority order for issuing permits will henceforth be based on the date recorded on the warehouse receipt held by the applicants. (2) Five articles regarding the government's method for paying warehouse rent and insurance premiums for purchased cotton yarn were approved. The full text is as follows:

Government's Method for Paying Warehouse Rent and Insurance Premiums for Purchased Cotton Yarn:

(1) The warehouse rent and insurance expenses for cotton yarn purchased by the government, from the day after the warehouse receipt is received to the day it is sold by the Textile Construction Company, will be borne by the committee. The number of pieces of yarn stored by each factory, based on the daily balance sheet of the Textile Construction Company's management office, will be calculated daily in accordance with the warehouse rent and insurance premium rates in Articles 2 and 3 below, and will be summarized and paid monthly.

(2) The warehouse rent will be handled in accordance with the warehouse rates jointly set by the Shanghai Money and Trust Industry Warehouse Association (for example, from February 1, 1947, the monthly warehouse rent per machine-packed yarn will be 3,000 yuan, for tube yarn it will be 1,000 yuan, and for straw-packed yarn it will be 800 yuan).

(3) Insurance matters will be handled by each factory on behalf of the government, and the expenses, regardless of the yarn count or the warehouse building grade, will be temporarily paid by the committee at a rate of 5 per thousand per year based on the purchase price of 20-count yarn in the month of sale.

(4) From the day after the sale by the Textile Construction Company to the tenth day, all warehouse rent and insurance expenses will be free of charge in accordance with the original regulations of each factory. From the eleventh day onwards, the expenses will be borne by the customers, and each factory can charge the customers directly according to the Textile Construction Company's charging standards.

(5) This method will be implemented from the date of its approval by the committee meeting.

### Yarn Market Sentiment Firm

Yesterday, the yarn market was even more buoyant, with continuous transactions from the interior. The sentiment was very strong because of this. At the beginning of the morning, prices soared by 100,000. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse Jincheng yarn once broke through the 3.9 million mark, an increase of 160,000 to 170,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine yarn and variable stock yarn also jumped by more than 200,000 yuan. As the market closed, many long positions were settled, causing a slight drop of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, but the trend was still quite stable.

### Interbank Lending Rates Reduced This Month

[Report from this newspaper] After receiving a letter from the National Bank requesting a reduction in interbank lending rates, the Banking Association and the Money Trade Association held a meeting a few days ago. At the meeting, it was decided to comply with the authorities' intention to reduce interest rates and reduce interbank lending rates for this month to four yuan, which is equivalent to 12 cents per yuan.

### Chen Guangfu Appointed as Deputy Chairman of the Export-to-Guangdong Committee

In addition, a batch of Taiwanese Oolong tea recently exported by the Chinese government to the United States, totaling 400,000 pounds, has been sold in the United States, with a transaction price of 45 US cents per pound.

### Following the Gold and Silver Auction, Import of Silverware Is Also Prohibited

### Raising Sons Seriously

— Qilou

A broadcast from London on the 30th presented statistics on the population of England and Wales. It mentioned that the number of infants has exceeded the "replacement level" for the first time in 24 years, expressing optimism. Looking at the numbers listed in the entire article, one is amazed by the seriousness with which the British raise their sons.

"There are three unfilial acts, and the greatest is to have no descendants." This is an ancient saying that we have had for thousands of years. In the early years of the Republic of China, during the high tide of overthrowing the Confucian family, some people advocated non-filial piety, saying "parents did not intentionally raise me." As a result, the ancient saying of "having no descendants" was completely denied by the general intellectual class. However, after a few years, this saying was rediscovered by some eugenic scholars who considered it very reasonable: the reason why China has not perished, and is still a vast and abundant country, especially a populous nation, is due in no small part to this kind of thinking of glorifying ancestors and benefiting descendants. Four hundred and fifty million is indeed a force. We should thank Mencius, who passed down this saying. From this, we can see the serious attitude of Westerners towards bearing and raising children. We Chinese have had this since ancient times. Looking at the efforts of our neighbors to raise sons, we can better understand how we are following this ancient teaching.

It is a pity that we do not have such statistics on infant births as Westerners. Our population figures have been recited like the Three Character Classic for decades and have not changed to this day. One book says 400 million, and another says 450 million, and there is no third new version. Then, how "great" is our so-called "no descendants is the greatest"?

Those who often travel south have probably seen a female beggar; for more than ten years, she has often knelt on the sidewalk begging. Initially, she was a single woman, but later there was a "candle package" infant, and when this child grew up, there was another "candle package." When the second child grew up, a third "candle package" appeared. Thus, the older children were also made to follow behind pedestrians begging. Therefore, the number of children remained at around three or four. "Candle packages" often appeared, but the number of older children did not increase. The female beggar's husband is probably also a filial son who practices "no descendants is the greatest." His ability is to work hard to bear and raise children, but the number of sons and daughters does not continue to increase. That mysterious point is just like our 400 million turning into 450 million. Some people say that if there is not enough effort, this number may decline, which is incomprehensible.

### "Borrow Rice, Return Rice" -- A Farmer A Bao's Poverty Record

— Meng Ping

"A Bao Rice" is a farmer from a village twenty miles west of Shanghai. He is an only child. When he was born, his parents loved him very much and called him A Bao Rice; people nearby, young and old, all called him A Bao Rice.

A Bao Rice is a self-cultivating farmer who plants fourteen mu of land. His fields are all close to his own residence. He has a mother, wife, and two children. His wife can help him with farming, transplanting rice seedlings, cultivating, carrying burdens, she can do everything. His thirteen-year-old daughter can cut grass to take care of the cattle, and sometimes cut shepherd's purse, alfalfa, and other wild vegetables to bring home for cooking. He does not need to ask for help with any of the labor. He saves money and lives frugally, and the family lives happily together.

The summer before last, A Bao Rice fell ill. He sought gods and worshipped Buddha, Taoist priests exorcised ghosts, he hired doctors and shamans, and got injections and took medicine. In this way, his finances changed, and he had to live beyond his means and borrow to get by.

"Borrow rice, return rice," "borrow wheat, return wheat" – this is the borrowing method of farmers in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area in recent years. Farmers do not understand inflation, and do not understand that the fundamental cause of inflation is the civil war; they only know that goods will slowly rise in price, and paper money will gradually become worthless. Creditors have suffered from "borrow money, return money," and have gradually developed the habit of "borrow goods, return goods." A Bao Rice is no exception, and began to "borrow rice, return rice."

At the end of the lunar year, A Bao Rice had no money to celebrate the New Year, so he borrowed one dan of rice from the Chen family to sell for money to buy vegetables. On the fifteenth day of the lunar New Year, the couple carried one dan of rice to return to the Chen family. Someone asked, "Why did you return it so quickly?" The Chen family replied, "He borrowed rice from someone else to return it. It's embarrassing to borrow it for a long time, so he had to borrow from A to return to B, and borrow from C to return to A, borrowing and returning in turn, to get through until the new grain comes to market." (This way, you can save on paying interest.) "You have to borrow rice before the lunar new year, and return it when the new grain comes to market, and then you have to borrow rice again at the end of the lunar year, right?" "Yes, the more you borrow, the poorer you get. It's not just him. Some people don't even have rice to eat when the new grain comes to market." "Will they probably have to sell their land in the future?" "Hmm! Maybe."

A Bao Rice, a self-cultivating farmer who is about to become a semi-tenant farmer, has had some changes in his temperament recently. He resents his fate and resents his wife. Sometimes, for small things, the couple even "quarrel."

### The Whole Country Goes Mad — A Story

— Yang Ren

This is a story that has been passed down since the Six Dynasties era:

"In the past, there was a country in which there was a river called Zaiquan. The people of the country drank this water, and none were unaffected. Only the ruler of the country dug a well and drew water, and was the only one unaffected. Since the people of the country were all affected, they instead said that the ruler's lack of madness was madness. So they gathered together to discuss and captured the ruler together to cure his madness, using fire, moxa, needles, and medicine, without missing anything. The ruler could not bear the suffering, and also went to the source of the spring, drew water and drank it, and became mad after drinking. Ruler and subjects, high and low, were all mad as one, and the crowd was satisfied!"

This story, although simple, is very interesting. A group of mad people do not realize their madness, but instead say that those who are not mad are mad. It makes right and wrong upside down, and it is extremely absurd!

The most ridiculous thing is that you are clearly not mad, but people insist on saying that you are sick, so they "use fire, moxa, needles, and medicine" and force you to be treated, and the pain is unbearable.

It is like that ruler, who is still a sensible person. He knows that it is useless to persist and does not want to suffer any more injustice, so he drinks Zaiquan and "becomes mad as one." Thus, the emotions of the people are reconciled, and the whole country goes mad! Such a win-win situation, why not do it!

### Living Expenses for Teachers and Staff

— Tian Di Ren

According to reports, in order to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff in schools in the "interior," the Ministry of Education has planned to provide living subsidies to teachers and staff in areas other than Ping, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and Dihua, so that their salaries are the same as those in the above five cities, in order to prevent the past phenomenon of talent concentrating in major cities. This issue is of course "very good" in "principle," but how to "implement" it still needs to be worked out by the Executive Yuan in conjunction with the Ministry of Education.

At present, the living expenses of teachers and staff, except for a few special areas, are mostly pitiful! Taking Shanghai County, which is adjacent to Shanghai and has repeatedly proposed to be incorporated into the urban area, as an example, the highest basic salary for teachers and staff in national schools is 70 yuan, and the basic amount of the subsidy is 75,000 yuan, 440 times that, which is 105,870 yuan. Although the government has explicitly ordered that the treatment be adjusted from January of this year, stipulating 110,000 yuan for bound books, 750 times that, which is an increase of about 50,000 yuan, the fact is that January is still the old standard, with empty promises but no real benefits; and since the beginning of this semester, not a penny has been issued, which is simply impossible to receive even the old standard, isn't that strange.

It is said that the county government's budget only lists a few central national schools, and the funds for most non-central national schools will be the responsibility of the township chiefs and bailiffs to raise. If this is the case, it is not only close to harsh harassment, but also fully demonstrates the government's lack of solutions to education. Moreover, before fundraising begins, it must go through the legislative procedures of the public opinion institutions, and then be submitted to the province for approval before fundraising can begin. Will fundraising be as smooth and easy as imagined? After fundraising, how will it be kept and used? If the progress is delayed and cannot solve the urgent need, will the teachers and staff be forced to work on an empty stomach? These are all very "brain-wracking" things. (According to reports: Gan Yunshou, an educator from Jiangsu Province, has submitted a report to the Ministry of Education to oppose it.)

The Ministry of Education's desire to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff is certainly a joyous thing, but the matter is urgent. The sound of footsteps on the stairs has been heard, but hopefully someone will come down soon.

### Record of a City in Peril

— Qin Shouou

The truck that the theater troupe hoped to borrow has, to this day, still not materialized. Although the person in charge of the ×× Commander's Office had indicated that they could allow Old Zhu and all the troupe members to leave with the army when they had to retreat, he saw that the troops going to the front lines to reinforce were so lacking in transportation, and that they were almost always walking on foot, so he did not dare to imagine what the situation would be like when they retreated. Also, Lan and the two children's travel problem had not been resolved. Since Xu Shaoming's wife returned from Liuzhou, living in the Xu family was really no more comfortable than being on the front lines. That tall and thin Shandong wife raised her voice all day long, and spoke to everyone she met; if it weren't for Lan's attitude towards Xu Shaoming being so disgusted and cold, this wife would have long since gotten jealous and caused a ruckus.

Lan had already decided not to wait for that endlessly delayed remittance, but she had never asked Xu Shaoming or Zhu Zhaonian to find her a ride; she disdained to ask the former, and was somewhat afraid to ask the latter.

Xiao Shen, who wanted to be very attentive to her, had a fantasy, hoping that he could get a small chartered car alone and take Lan and Feifei and Rong'er straight to Guiyang. But since Mrs. Xu Shaoming arrived the day before yesterday, his activities had been restricted. That tall and thin Mrs. Xu, the general manager, who walked like a man, was monitoring him with all her might, even more carefully than she monitored her own husband. If she didn't see him for ten minutes, she would raise her voice and shout "Xiao Shen, Xiao Shen" in her Shandong accent, which made Xiao Shen's heart and soul tremble. He deeply regretted that he should not have been so happy in Liuzhou and hooked up with this ogress. At the same time, he, Xiao Shen, a young master with the appearance of a movie star, really couldn't be as resourceful as the associate managers and Xu Shaoming in Guilin at this time; with all his strength, he might be able to get two or three people standing room only on the covered wagons chartered by the four national banks to the Xiang-Gui Railway, but he had no hope of getting a chartered car. After being turned down three or four times in different ways, he could only obediently give up this idea, although he couldn't help but strike up a few conversations every time he saw Lan.

In the past two or three days, Lan herself had been very busy running around. She went to see a former classmate from art school – now the wife of Secretary Huang of the provincial government, and another cousin of Lan's, a middle-level employee in the Xiang-Gui Railway Bureau. That Secretary's wife didn't forget the old days and actually agreed to take Lan's family to Mengshan on the provincial government's convenience boat, but this was different from Lan's purpose, so she could only politely decline her kindness. That cousin was a poor civil servant, but he still completely retained a human heart. He used all his strength to buy two first-class tickets to Liuzhou for Lan, but he couldn't get on the train several times, because most of the trains had been requisitioned to transport troops, and the passenger trains that were scheduled to depart were temporarily canceled.

I think that Principal Lu of our New Life Elementary School is the fattest person in the world, but he insists on wearing a Zhongshan suit that is too short and too small. The pant legs only go down to his calves, and the buttons on the collar are so tight that they squeeze the flesh of his fat throat out. Whenever he speaks, because the collar is too tight and he feels uncomfortable, he always uses his fat right hand to pull and press on the collar, then quickly retracts his head and neck, swallows his saliva, raises his head, and then speaks. Every time I see Principal Lu speaking, I get so anxious: don't break the buttons on that collar!

For example, today, Principal Lu is swallowing saliva again, so I am anxious again, but I hold my breath and watch quietly. I see him retracting his head and neck, then raising his head, and saying to us in his "standard Mandarin":

"Esteemed children: Today, this today, is April 4th, is this Children's Day. This this, Children's Day, is this the holiday of the children. And this Children's Day, in this one year, this this, there is only this one day, only this, April 4th. So this school, so this principal, for this Children's Day, for you children, will accompany you to have this some fun. Today in this park, it is free, but, this private park, this this, if this children this are not dressed neatly, that is to say, if this clothes are too dirty, that is, will this—not be allowed to enter. But this school, but this principal, can guarantee to everyone, can guarantee this everything, this the children of this school, all this are particular about cleanliness, so this this principal, the day before yesterday has already contacted this Erly Garden to play, contacted this World Theater to see a movie, sigh, um, this this, see a movie, see this, see this movie."

Speaking of this, our Principal Lu kept stretching his head and neck, kept swallowing his saliva, and kept using his fat hand to pull and press on his collar. Oh my, I'm really worried, don't let the button on that collar fly off with a "pop," but I hope that if it flies off, it will fly back immediately, fly onto his collar, like a fly, as long as it circles around, it will still hide in its original place, so that Principal Lu can continue to speak.

But Principal Lu could no longer speak, he stretched his head and neck, retracted his head and neck, but could no longer "this." Then what can be done if he can't "this"? Could it be that we are going to sit with Principal Lu and "this" all day?

Fortunately, the physical education teacher, Mr. Jiang, walked onto the podium. He stood next to Principal Lu and continued:

"Alright, you've all heard what Principal Lu just said. Now we'll start out, first visit Erly Garden, and then go to the World Theater at 2:30 to see a movie. So now we'll start, what does the principal think?"

"This this..." Principal Lu nodded, indicating his agreement.

So we lined up and walked out of the school.

When our line was about to reach Erly Garden, Xiao Gouzi saw me and shouted loudly –

"Qi Xiaohua!"

I turned around and saw Xiao Gouzi, who was dragging his snot and barefoot, throwing bricks on the road. Xiao Gouzi is our neighbor, his father is a mason, and he goes out barefoot early in the morning and doesn't come back until late at night. When he comes back, he is covered in mud and ash, and sometimes his face is covered in patches of white lime. Xiao Gouzi's mother works as a maid in our house. So Xiao Gouzi often comes to our house to play with me, and sometimes I even teach Xiao Gouzi to read, and I'm Xiao Gouzi's little teacher.

I was so happy to see Xiao Gouzi today! I waved to Xiao Gouzi, and Xiao Gouzi ran over immediately.

Xiao Gouzi walked with me, his shoulder next to mine.

I deliberately lowered my voice and said to Xiao Gouzi:

"Hey, Xiao Gouzi, do you know that today is Children's Day!"

Xiao Gouzi was stunned, he thought for a long time, and then asked me seriously:

"What is an ear-bucket day? Does a bucket not have a day? I saw my dad's mason bucket, made of wood, and they all have days."

"Hey, Xiao Gouzi, you don't even know what Children's Day is?" I felt a little sorry for Xiao Gouzi, I said in a low voice, "Children's Day is a good day for us children!"

"But I haven't gone to school, my dad doesn't have money, I can only be a wild child, I'm not your 'child'!"

I felt very sad when I heard Xiao Gouzi's words, but I comforted Xiao Gouzi, I said:

"All children are children, and children should have a good day today!"

"What kind of good day?"

"Play in the garden, watch a movie."

"Can I go in with you too?"

"You can go in too."

Xiao Gouzi was so happy to hear this, he jumped and hopped, took my hand, and squeezed in front of me, lining up in our line.

At this time, our line had reached the gate of Erly Garden. Principal Lu and Mr. Jiang told us to stop, they walked to the gate and talked to the gatekeeper for a while, and then Mr. Jiang walked over, stood in front of our line, and shouted loudly:

"Attention—right turn—count off!"

Hearing Mr. Jiang's loud shout, Xiao Gouzi was stunned. He immediately moved his feet stealthily and walked outside the line, like a passing child, curiously looking at us.

After the count-off was completed, Mr. Jiang issued the order again:

"Left turn—march!"

So thirty-six children walked through the gate of Erly Garden.

Only Xiao Gouzi, he stood there blankly, standing at the gate, watching us one by one walk into the gate of the garden.

Our line was disbanded, and the children went in groups of twos and threes to play by the pond and in the rockery. I was full of anger: why not let Xiao Gouzi come in and play together?

At one o'clock, Mr. Jiang blew his whistle to gather the children, line them up, and walk out of Erly Garden to go to the World Theater to see a movie.

When the line passed the corner of Foch Road and Albert Road, Xiao Gouzi stealthily walked beside me again. He said somewhat reproachfully:

"I waited outside, why did you play for so long?"

I was full of shame, what could I say to Xiao Gouzi? Why didn't I ask Mr. Jiang to let Xiao Gouzi come in too? Why didn't I... After thinking about it, I always felt too sorry for Xiao Gouzi, so I said:

"Xiao Gouzi, let's go see a movie, don't be afraid this time, come in with me!"

Xiao Gouzi was so moved when he heard my words that his face turned red, he immediately looked at his clothes and asked me doubtfully:

"Really?"

"Really!" I answered straightforwardly.

So Xiao Gouzi joined our line again. This time he was behind me. I kept turning back to talk to him. I saw Xiao Gouzi walking carefully, he wiped away the two old snot streaks with his sleeve, and then patted the mud and ash off his body with his palms. From Xiao Gouzi's actions, I saw how confident and happy Xiao Gouzi felt.

The line stopped in front of the World Theater. After Principal Lu "this this" negotiated with the ticket collector for a while, we walked into the theater one by one according to the lined up line.

The ticket collector counted the number of people: "One, two..."

When I was about to pass in front of the ticket collector, the two ticket collectors almost simultaneously roared loudly –

"Hmph! You little rascal!"

I turned around and saw two ticket collectors grabbing the collar of Xiao Gouzi's ragged clothes with four strong hands, dragging him out of the line and slapping him hard. When they dragged Xiao Gouzi to the stone steps at the entrance of the theater, one of the ticket collectors kicked Xiao Gouzi's butt hard with his right leg, and Xiao Gouzi cried out "Wow" and, like a carrot, fell and rolled from the eight stone steps all the way to the road.

I hurried out, ran to Xiao Gouzi's side, and helped the crying Xiao Gouzi up. I kept saying, "He is my friend, he is my friend!"

At this time, Principal Lu and Mr. Jiang also rushed to my side. Mr. Jiang grabbed my hand, and with a stern face, said:

"He is a little rascal, he is not our friend!"

I was very unhappy when I heard these words, so I said:

"He is my neighbor friend, I want him to watch a movie with me."

"This this," the fat Principal Lu also anxiously touched his collar with his fat hands, "This this, he is not qualified to watch this movie."

"Why?" I said with a crying face: "Why? Isn't today Children's Day? Can't all the children in the world play together today? Isn't today..."

"This this, Children's Day is this Children's Day, but this—that Children's Day is not this Children's Day..."

Principal Lu and Mr. Jiang dragged me into the theater, but for "Children's Day," for our good day, I couldn't help but cry loudly.

### Snow Scene

— Liu Yiying, 11 years old

### New Children's Rhymes

— Chen Bochui

——In Memory of the Poor Children's Day of the Republic of China, Year 36

Picking up pebbles as jewelry,

Riding bamboo poles as horses.

Running to the Dragon King Temple,

Looking at the clouds in the sky.

We want to fly away on the wind,

And travel through cities and islands all over the world.

We have our own world,

You can call us little daydreamers.

Breaking off a few willow branches,

Picking a few purple cloud flowers,

Weaving a crown of flowers is so beautiful.

Whoever wants to be crowned, he (she) is the emperor!

But the emperor also sits with the beggar on the grass,

Eating pancakes and drinking boiled water together,

Of course, there is no dragon bed or dragon chair.

Don't laugh at us for being too childish,

The happiest thing in the world is playing games.

Little streams, flowing water,

Putting leaves down as boats,

Let them flow slowly.

Our hearts have already been given to them,

They will carry us to visit some strange places;

Girls, large crucian carp,

And small crabs and large jellyfish.

Please don't call us little navigators,

We don't dig for gold,

Our pockets are stuffed with a handful of weeds.

We ask the stars why they keep twinkling,

Ask why the sea is never full? Why are minerals always hidden in the mountains?

Also ask why some people can't get enough to eat even if they work,

And wear such ragged clothes?

We want to understand clearly,

This world we live in.

Haha, you think we are annoying,

That the questions we ask are not worth half a cent, and you are speechless!

To the Children of Zhuang Village

I, a farmer who has lost his land, am like a bird with broken wings, falling on the grassland where you live. I know that it is difficult for me to soar in the blue sky again, so; your grassland has become my home.

As soon as I crossed the threshold of your kingdom, I was amazed and regretted the past, the past, that series of lives that were not lives, tormented me, causing worldliness and hypocrisy to bury my emotions. It made me sob as I held up my insulted and trampled soul. And this time, resting by the cradle of your emotions, seeing your true purity and frankness, innocence and selflessness, my conscience, immersed in tears, smiled and returned to childhood.

You—the lights and flowers of the world! How can the world do without you? Just as I cannot do without the sincere emotions of the world to brighten my dark life, even if I am a farmer who has lost his land, a snail with shrunken antennae, and living on this green land of yours, I also joyfully rub my calloused hands and raise my hoe while sweating!

And I, no longer like the past, my eyes chasing the passing white clouds, my mouth chewing on the bitter fruit of emptiness and loneliness, wandering in the desolate forest in autumn, carrying broken fallen leaves, and softly chanting poems of late-year heartbreak! Because in cultivation, I have the hope of harvest, and in emotion, I have the harvest of hope; the seed drill of my ideals is rolling again on this fertile land.

But on this trembling ancient land, people! are like a small boat on the ocean, constantly being tossed and battered by the wind and waves. A week ago, during the days when the wind and rain struck, I briefly bid farewell to you, holding your budding soil, and you actually thought that I would not return, and your tears, along with the raindrops, soaked my luggage and my heart. When I walked very far and far away and looked back again, you, a group of young send-offs, were still standing foolishly in the rain, like a group of small wooden chickens who had lost their mother hen. ... And when I returned to your presence again, you were like a swarm of bees; clustered around me. ...

Alas! Why would I be willing to leave you? Today, I feel that leaving you is an impossible and cruel thing. But what can I do? I fly up and fall down, fall down and fly up. ...

Today, I am carrying the heavy emotions you have given me, and it is most difficult to leave you. When I leave you, I have a small part of the joy of a mother bird flying out of the nest to look for food, I have a large part of the joy of a navigator setting sail; but I also have a share of the sadness of a farmer who has lost his land again!

Don't shed those bright and sparkling pearl tears for me anymore, and don't wish me to go out safely and return safely! When I wander in a foreign land, whether I have obtained a piece of land to cultivate or not, I want to obtain news of the harvest on your land, and I will always sing the songs of sprouting on this land. ...

### Celebrating Children's Day

— Zhang Yiqu

Every year, this day broadcasts new sounds,
Again, the joyous Children's Festival arrives.
Flowers bloom and water flows, life is invigorated,
Kites fly and fish leap, sharing a profound joy.
Endless vitality in the footsteps of spring,
An innocent heart unstained by the world's dust.
Cherishing the hope of nation-building in the next generation,
Future steeds, though not yet fully grown, advance rapidly.

### On Children's Art Education

I remember on June 6, 1936, at the stadium in the new city area of Jiangwan—the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, in order to "promote children's art education," specially entrusted the Municipal Education Bureau, the China Art Education Society, the China Child Welfare Association, and five other organizations to organize a "National Children's Art Exhibition." There were twenty-four participating units, with a total of over 40,000 works on display, a grand and dazzling sight. Unexpectedly, it became an unprecedented and unsurpassed feat!

Until today, ten years have passed. Although everything was brought to a standstill and destruction due to the eight-year war of resistance, the final victory has finally arrived. Everything is shouting slogans of "rehabilitation," "revival," and "establishment," but only "children's art education" is barely mentioned. What a regrettable thing this is!

"Art education" has been implemented in primary schools for nearly twenty years. Although there were many shortcomings in the past, making it difficult to fully satisfy people, it was much more vigorous compared to the current situation.

"Art" has a great function in enlightening children's spirituality—it not only expresses the inherent love of beauty in human beings, but also cultivates bad tempers; it not only fosters creative habits, but also enhances good virtues. These are all things that children themselves cannot discover or actively apply. Therefore, I have to put forward the following suggestions for those responsible for educating children:

"Children's art education," first and foremost, should enable children to appreciate beauty and inspire their aesthetic interests. To achieve intangible aesthetic education, it is necessary to create a beautiful environment around children's daily lives—clothing, food, shelter, transportation, and even schools and classrooms, as well as the toys that children need, must all be carefully considered, because these are all sufficient to increase children's appreciation and recognition of beauty.

For example, clothes don't need to be made of good materials, just be well-fitting and clean, and that is beauty. Food doesn't need to be plentiful, just eat the right amount at the right time and place, and that is beauty... These are all things that parents and teachers need to arrange and guide.

Secondly, how to enable children to learn and cultivate their innate ability to love beauty and create—visit exhibitions, and use art to replace their crude and vulgar games.

Thirdly, how to enable children to pursue beauty and create an upward mentality—look at the works of famous people, watch the biographies of famous artists, and even tell simple art stories and art history, so that they have a basic concept of art (especially the art of our country, which has a long history of thousands of years). It is not enough to simply copy paintings and draw a few gourds.

The above points: have been promoted with considerable success in Western Europe and Japan. I hope that in China, this work will not be taken lightly. I especially hope that the teachers responsible for children's education, in addition to paying attention to children's physical health, must also cultivate children's mental health.

### "Our Holiday"?

— Yang Gonghuai

Today is the happy Children's Day,

Little Sanzi heard a string of good news:

What——

You can watch movies in the theater without paying;

You can rest your legs in the park without buying a ticket;

The candies in the store are all discounted;

The children's clothing in the company is also on sale;

There are also many fun places,

I heard they are also inviting us for a treat!

He couldn't care less about the scary face of "Uncle,"

He sneaked to the street and strode forward,

No matter what, he has to have a good time:

He ran to the theater,

The receptionist said, "It's already full!"

He ran to the park,

The policeman at the gate cursed him as a little rascal,

Not allowing him to take another look inside.

All the stores, companies, and entertainment venues,

Are crowded with young masters and young ladies.

There are many companions like him at the door!

At this time,

Little Sanzi's heart was cold.

He understood, everywhere welcomes:

Are the young masters and young ladies from wealthy families,

Not us children in ragged clothes.

He returned to "Uncle" dejectedly,

"Little devil, sneaking out to play, now you're happy?

"Slap!" A big slap came down,

Little Sanzi suffered a great injustice, and tears streamed down his face!

A burst of singing came from the street:

"Children's Day,

Full of joy,

Today is our holiday,

Everywhere is filled with laughter!

Today is our holiday,

Everywhere is filled with laughter!"

Little Sanzi covered his mouth, wiped away his tears,

And muttered softly:

"I've had enough today,

Who wants to listen to your nonsense!"

### A School Story

— Xiao Jue

I started school at the age of six. At that time, in the small town where I lived, there were two kinds of schools. One was a private school, where they only read books like the Analects and Mencius; the other was a school, but at that time, people mostly called it "Western-style school." One of my cousins was a conservative person. He strongly opposed my going to "Western-style school," saying that "Western-style school" was "disorderly," but my mother's opinion was the opposite of my cousin's, not wanting me to go to a private school to read dead books. But in the end, following my cousin's opinion, I entered a private school very close to my home.

The day I started school was an "auspicious day." This was selected by my cousin after spending a lot of time. My grandmother's family sent a lot of cakes, zongzi, and a green satin satchel embroidered with carp jumping over the dragon gate. In addition, there was a stool that had been prepared long ago, a red-lacquered stool that shone brightly. On the legs of the stool was tied a sprig of evergreens. What does it mean? I still don't understand, but it is probably a kind of "good luck." Under the stool, there were also sugar cakes, which were said to be stuck so that the child would sit still and study, and would not play around. Because the sugar cakes are sticky, they stick the child's butt. Thinking about it now, it's really ridiculous.

That day, I wore a long robe and short jacket, dressed like a "little gentleman." I was accompanied by my uncle to the private school. Because it was the first time going to school, I had to give the old classmates sugar tea. The meaning of this was said to be that in the future, we would be able to study together harmoniously. So we were followed by a maid, who carried a large pot of sugar tea, ready to be distributed to the students in the private school. Just as we walked into the alley leading to that private school, we saw many heads inside shaking and reciting books. Stepping into the study, the sound of reading suddenly quieted down, and dozens of small eyes focused on me. I was so shy that I hid behind my uncle.

My uncle took me to bow to the teacher, and then bowed to Confucius. Then I sat on the bright red-lacquered stool, staring blankly at the maid distributing sugar tea to the classmates.

This private school, perhaps influenced by the "Western-style school," had also become new. Below the statue of Confucius hanging in the center of the study, there was also a portrait of the Founding Father, and on both sides, there were also two Qing Tian Bai Ri flags with who knows how many angles.

In this way, I mingled among a group of children and slowly learned to shake my head and recite books. (Revised in February, 1947)
