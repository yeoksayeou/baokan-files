### Qu Yuan and the Book of Odes

— Luo Genzhe

Qu Yuan's ability to become a great writer should not be based on reliance on the Book of Odes.

I do not intend to say that Qu Yuan did not continue to read the Book of Odes, I only wish to point out that "Li Sao" and "Heavenly Questions" cite many ancient stories, but there is no trace of the Book of Odes. "Lament for Past Days" once said "Received the mandate to illuminate the poems," and "Lament for the Returning Wind" also said "Secretly compose poems to enlighten," but unfortunately, neither can prove that it specifically refers to the Book of Odes.

Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian" specifies that Song Yu was "after Qu Yuan's death." We have a way to guarantee that he did read the Book of Odes because his "Nine Arguments" has the two sentences "Secretly admire the legacy of the poets, willing to entrust my aspirations to simple meals." It is clearly quoting the "Fa Tan" chapter of the Book of Odes: "That gentleman, does not eat simple meals." Qu Yuan has more surviving works than Song Yu, and cites more ancient stories than Song Yu, but he did not leave any sentences related to the Book of Odes.

The close relationship between Qu Yuan and the Book of Odes began with Liu An of the Western Han Dynasty's attempts to draw them together. Reliance on the Book of Odes, and even other classics, was not discovered until the well-intentioned discovery of Wang Yi at the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty.

According to Ban Gu's "Preface to Li Sao," "King Huainan An (i.e., Liu An) narrated the "Li Sao," believing that the Guofeng were fond of beauty without being lewd, and the Xiaoya were resentful without being chaotic. As for "Li Sao," it can be said to combine both." Sima Qian wrote "Records of the Grand Historian," and completely included "Biography of Qu Yuan and Jia Sheng." From then on, "Li Sao" and the Book of Odes shared the same aim, and Qu Yuan had a close relationship with the Book of Odes.

The relationship established by Liu An and Sima Qian was only a relationship of equal aim. Ban Gu further forged the idea that the source of the "Sao" before and after originated from poetry. In his "Book of Han: A Brief Discussion of Literary Records of Poems and Odes," he said:

"It is said that reciting without singing is called "Fu." Being able to compose "Fu" when ascending to a high place can make one a senior official... The Zhou dynasty declined, and the singing and recitation of inquiries did not take place in the various states. Scholars of poetry escaped into common clothes, and the "Fu" of virtuous men who lost their aspirations were created. Great Confucian Xun Qing and Chu-style Qu Yuan, concerned about the country and dissenting opinions, all created "Fu" to admonish, with a meaning of empathy and ancient poetry."

Here he names Qu Yuan's literary style as "Fu." The creation of "Fu" was due to "scholars of poetry escaping into common clothes," and the meaning of "Fu" "all had empathy and the meaning of ancient poetry." In other words, "Fu" originated from poetry and was the same as poetry. Therefore, in "Preface to the Two Capitals Fu," he simply said, "Fu is a branch of ancient poetry." Then Qu Yuan's works naturally originated from the Book of Odes.

Following this instruction, Wang Yi saw that Qu Yuan's "Li Sao" originally relied on the Book of Odes, and even relied on other classics. His eternally famous "Commentary to the Chapters and Sentences of Chu Ci" first put forward Confucius' "Fixed the classics, deleted the poems and books, rectified rituals and music, and created the Spring and Autumn Annals, to be the laws of later kings." Then he lamented that "the Warring States contended, morality declined, and deceit emerged." Then he said:

"Qu Yuan, loyal and slandered, worried and sad, alone relied on the meaning of the poets to create "Li Sao."

Then he specifically pointed out that the "Li Sao" relied on the Book of Odes and even other classics, saying:

"The text of "Li Sao" relies on the Five Classics to establish its meaning: "A descendant of Emperor Gaoyang," then "Hated the first birth of the people, the time was Jiang Yuan;" "Sewing autumn orchids as a pendant," then "Will fly, will fly, wear jade pendant;" "In the evening, embracing the bushes of the continent," then the "Dragon's latent, do not use" of the Book of Changes; "Riding a jade dragon and riding a chariot," then "Sometimes riding six dragons to control the sky;" "Going to Chonghua to present words," then the Shangshu Jiusi's plot of Wei; "Ascending Kunlun and wading through the quicksand," then the Yugong's spreading of the land."

Wang Yi was an expert in Chu Ci. His "Commentary to the Chapters and Sentences of Chu Ci" is the most widely circulated and also the oldest Chu Ci monograph. Therefore, Qu Yuan's reliance on the Book of Odes became an unquestionable fact. I do not intend to say that this fact is absurd, I only wish to point out the psychological interest of the Han people in saying this.

The scholars of the May Fourth era only criticized the ancients for "The Book of Odes says," "Confucius said." The power of "It is finished, it says" later became higher than "The Book of Odes says." In the Han Dynasty, "The Book of Odes says" was still the most authoritative. Several influential books in the Western Han Dynasty, such as the Classic of Filial Piety, Biographies of Exemplary Women, Xin Xu, and Garden of Stories, almost all concluded each chapter by quoting verses from the Book of Odes. Verses from the Book of Odes became the highest guide for ethics and politics at that time. As for "Fu," on the one hand, it was loved, and on the other hand, it was despised. For example, Emperor Wu of Han loved Ci Fu the most, but to the Ci Fu writers Dongfang Shuo and Mei Fiu, he "kept them as actors" ("Book of Han: Biography of Yan Zhu"), making them only "humorous" ("Biography of Dongfang Shuo"). In addition, Mei Cheng was even more grieved and "regretted that he was like a prostitute" ("Biography of Mei Cheng").

To save Ci Fu from the fate of actors, it was best to establish a close relationship with the Book of Odes. Because on the one hand, being humiliated and humble could be transcended by it. On the other hand, it was a literary work and easier to draw together. "Fu" was originally "inspired by poets and expanded in Chu Ci" ("Wen Xin Diao Long: Interpretation of Fu"). As long as Chu Ci was the same as the Book of Odes, there would be no problem. Liu An's writing of the Biography of Li Sao, according to the original biography in the Book of Han and Gao You's "Preface to Huainan Honglie Jie," was due to Emperor Wu's edict ("Gao Preface" says "Li Sao Fu"). Then it was of course written to be presented to Emperor Wu for his viewing. He proposed here that the meaning of "Li Sao" combined Guofeng and Xiaoya. Isn't this mood and function enough for us to savor?

This statement was probably quickly adopted and promoted. Sima Qian's inclusion in "Biography of Qu Yuan" is clear evidence passed down. His efforts were not wasted. By the time of Emperor Xuan of Han, someone requested the abolition of Ci Fu. Emperor Xuan refuted this and issued an edict saying:

"The greater Ci Fu is the same in meaning as poetry, and the lesser Ci Fu is beautiful and pleasing. It is like women's work having brocade and embroidery, and music having Zheng and Wei. Today, the secular still uses these to please the eyes and ears. Ci Fu is like this, for it has the view of benevolence, righteousness, and wind admonitions, birds, beasts, grass, and trees, and is more knowledgeable than actors and board games." ("Book of Han: Biography of Wang Bao")

Although it was still inevitably regarded as being the same as brocade and Zheng Wei, it was ultimately "the same in meaning as poetry," and thus "more virtuous than actors and board games."

This path was good, and someone had spoken of it first. Later generations naturally easily and unconsciously developed it, gradually discovering that although Qu Yuan was an aristocrat, his writing of Fu was due to "scholars of poetry escaping into common clothes," and gradually discovering that his "Li Sao" originally relied on the Book of Odes, and even other classics.

### The Past is Like Smoke, Talking About Dragon Boat Festival

— Zhao Qingge

In peaceful years, in the North, the Dragon Boat Festival is the most beautiful and elegant festival. Just entering summer, there is still a bit of late spring weather. Not too hot and not too cold, perfect for wearing soft jackets or spun silk shirts. Peonies, hydrangeas, gardenias, and white orchids are all in full bloom. Peaches and apricots are plump and sweet, with a white blush, just like a young girl's face.

The first major event of the Dragon Boat Festival is the sachet (also known as a fragrant purse). For the first ten days, women are busy preparing them. This is a good gift for mothers to give to their children and for sisters to give to each other. They use colorful scraps of silk to make small pastries and small animals of various shapes, such as: Buddha's hand, pomegranate, grape, pear, peach, lotus pod, water chestnut. Cats, dogs, monkeys, rabbits, shrimps, fish... etc., a dazzling array. The workmanship is delicate and exquisite, vividly resembling the real thing. Each core is filled with spices (hence the name "fragrant purse"), and then matched with silk thread woven tassels, which is really the icing on the cake, a hundred times more brilliant! On the Dragon Boat Festival, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl wears a sky-blue spun silk cheongsam, with a golden Buddha's hand sachet tied to the large lapel button, matched with lotus root-colored tassels, and a pomegranate flower inserted in her temples. Walking in the clear breeze and warm sun, the fragrance is pleasant, and she is refined and ethereal. Can she not feel light and carefree?

The second major event is zongzi and realgar wine. Of course, you also need to prepare some other pastries, such as deep-fried sugar cakes and sesame crispy leaves. However, zongzi and realgar wine are the most important. As long as a family is doing well, they always have to wrap one and a half liters of glutinous rice zongzi, buy three or two cents of realgar, and make one and a half kilograms of daqu sorghum wine to celebrate the occasion.

Perhaps it is because our poet Qu Yuan jumped into the Miluo River on the Dragon Boat Festival that this commemorative day has become poetic! In addition to the melancholy and indignant meaning of Qu Yuan's "embracing sand and self-immersion," the endowment of nature and the embellishment of future generations have transformed the Dragon Boat Festival into a fun, emotional, picturesque, and poetic festival!

I love the Dragon Boat Festival. The Dragon Boat Festival that impressed me the most was when I was fifteen years old. My grandmother was still alive, and I was at home in my hometown. The garden behind the house was still full of flowers, with green bamboos forming a shade. Early in the morning, I put on a pink-green silk cheongsam, with a string of small lotus pod and water chestnut sachets on the front lapel, and a pair of sky-blue satin embroidered shoes. Triumphantly, I greeted my elders for the festival. My grandmother smeared wine-soaked realgar on my ears, nose, and palms, saying that it could prevent poisonous insects from biting. Then I ate some zongzi, sugar cakes, peaches, and apricots. At lunchtime, there was a formal family banquet. My father poured a glass of realgar wine for everyone and led us to drink it. Heaven knows, this was the first time in my life that I drank alcohol, and from this time on, I formed an indissoluble bond with alcohol! More than ten years have passed, and now, just as I am beginning to abstain from alcohol due to illness, I cannot help but feel emotional when I look back on the past! Therefore, I want to specifically describe the process of my first drinking!

After a glass of daqu went down, my father saw that my face did not change color, and he was very surprised and delighted! He believed that I had accepted his habit of drinking as an inheritance and would be able to be his drinking companion. At the same time, I was also quite proud of myself. Taking advantage of my happiness, I drank three more glasses in a row. Then, I felt something was different. I was dizzy and my heart was burning. But I didn't tell my father. I pretended that nothing was wrong, left the table, and quietly slipped to the back garden alone. I found a clean patch of grass under the bamboo shade to lie down and thought that the wind would make me feel better. Who knew that this tossing about would make things worse. For a while, the world was spinning, and with a turn, I almost vomited out my internal organs! My new silk cheongsam was soiled, and the sachet smelled bad, and the embroidered shoes were covered in mud. I didn't have time to take care of these things. After a burst of discomfort, my emotions fluctuated, and a layer of melancholic mist enveloped my soul. Tears welled up, and I called out to my dead mother, and the more she didn't respond, the sadder I became! I don't remember how long I cried before I fell asleep exhausted. When I woke up, it was already late at night. The old nanny was sitting on the edge of my bed, holding a covered bowl of tea to feed me, but my mouth had lost its flexibility and uncontrollably bit the edge of the covered bowl, causing the old nanny's child, Xiao Tu'er, to laugh loudly, which made me so angry that I pushed Xiao Tu'er to the ground with one hand.

I seemed to be sick the next day and didn't get out of bed all day. My grandmother told me that yesterday my father had also drunk too much wine, and we, father and son, were both drunk and in a mess. Oh, this was still my first time getting drunk! I carefully pondered the taste of being drunk. I felt that being drunk gave me pain, but it also gave me pleasure. Usually, I rarely cried out or cried like that. I could only silently miss my mother, and I could only secretly shed tears! Because I was afraid of making my father sad and I was afraid of making my stepmother angry! But after being drunk, I didn't care about others. Wine made me more courageous, and wine made me express my true feelings! For this reason, I began to love wine and began to need to be drunk!

In that year, I left my hometown, left my home. In my wandering life, I never again experienced a Dragon Boat Festival like when I was fifteen years old. But I often drank wine and often got drunk! In order to increase my courage and in order to express my true feelings!

Now that I am abstaining from alcohol according to my doctor's instructions, I can't help but think of my first drunkenness!

Because the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching again, I can't help but think of my hometown in the flames of war, my broken home, my old father, my unrecoverable childhood, and the sachets!

What can I do? Everything has gone far away. The past is like smoke! The past is like smoke!

The day before the Dragon Boat Festival in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic, on the anniversary of my late mother's birth.

### Portrait of Qu Yuan

### Qu Yuan's Grief and Indignation

— Lu Danlin

Qu Yuan – anyone who has studied Chinese literary history knows that he was a great poet in our country's history. For more than two thousand years, his works have illuminated the universe, and the day he drowned himself in the Miluo River has also become a festival commemorated by the people of the country every year. In recent years, there have even been proposals to designate it as Poet's Day.

Qu Yuan lived in the second half of the Warring States period. At that time, scholars and experts were emerging in large numbers, and the country was about to enter a turning point toward great unification. Old ideas were shaking, and new ideas had not yet formed. The strong annexed the weak, the many oppressed the few. The rulers and ministers were scheming, each fighting for supremacy; treacherous officials and politicians were busy excluding dissidents, creating a chaotic situation. Qu Yuan was born into an aristocratic family and was a young and promising statesman, as well as a brilliant diplomat. When he first entered politics, he smoothly displayed his economic aspirations. The Historical Records say of him: "Extensive learning and strong memory, clear about governance and chaos, skilled in rhetoric. When he entered the court, he discussed national affairs with the king to issue orders; when he went out, he received guests and responded to the lords. The king trusted him very much..." However, because of his special talents, he was able to handle things with ease and gain the trust of King Huai, he was met with the jealousy of the insidious and cunning Jin Shang and others, who secretly slandered him to the king. Those in power neither understood his hardships, nor could they truly recognize his talents, and thus did not know how to appoint people wisely and entrust him with important responsibilities. Therefore, Qu Yuan was exiled, and wrote "Li Sao" in a wandering and troubled life.

Qu Yuan had noble and great thoughts, and contained ardent and pure emotions. He loved his country and loved his people, holding the grand aspiration of sacrificing himself to transform society. However, this great aspiration could not be realized, and instead suffered inexplicable blows. He then turned to vivid and magnificent writing to create vast, lingering, and poignant poems, denouncing the pleasures and greed of treacherous officials, expressing his own loyal personality, and the transcendent realm of the unity of heaven and man. He fully expressed his transcendent thoughts, vented his passionate emotions, and achieved a great work that revealed emotions and had a magnificent spirit. For more than two thousand years, he has always been a great poet unprecedented in history, and also a failed politician. In terms of politics, he was dismissed because he was unwilling to be in the same boat as those who were corrupt. "The world is turbid and cannot be distinguished, and likes to obscure beauty and be jealous." He was in such an environment, and since he could not live independently from the world, his only way to live was to walk towards death (self-immersion). "The world is contrary to me, I would rather follow where Peng Xian lives" to express his own personality. What a sad and indignant final scene of life.

The tragic end of a virtuous literary artist entering politics is the most regrettable and sad, but his spirit of walking towards the path of freedom is immortal.

### Poetic Sayings

— Shen Xianyuan

The poet who can create poems that traverse the universe is not a magician who turns a donkey into a dragon foal, but uses the power of his own wisdom to drive the dragon foal, making its hooves, which rise to chase the wind, gallop like a feather arrow piercing through the clouds. If a person vainly envies or is jealous of another's good fortune in obtaining this famous foal, and forgets to hone his own horsemanship, it is the most sorrowful.

### Sacrificing to Qu Yuan

— Kengqiang

The ancient Xiangyin city pierced the gloomy sky,

The flowing water of the Miluo River forever sobs mournfully.

Poet! From today on,

Mankind has produced a truly foolish person.

Those who are overly clever!

Only deserve to have their names engraved on the "Hall of Meritorious Officials."

(But that is the glory of slaves)

Truth is eternal,

Even if there are occasionally two or three dark clouds,

But soon they will dissipate.

Resent your own misfortune!

Corrupt rulers, treacherous lords, dark rule,

Dark clouds obscure the light.

"Everyone is turbid, I alone am clear,

Everyone is drunk, I alone am sober."

You, holding a compassionate heart,

Drowned in the murmuring river of Miluo.

Rest quietly!

Your poems are like the crowing of a rooster before dawn.

Look at the end of the darkness in the East,

The light of dawn is faintly visible.

Dirge for Qu Yuan - Qin Song

Vast is the Miluo River,

Boundless are the waves of the ages.

You are forever angry,

You are forever sad,

Rushing

Towards the Xiang River, where mournful songs are sung!

Waves are surging on Dongting Lake,

Still reflecting the same

Bright moonlight as two thousand years ago.

Great poet,

Your soul forever shines with light!

Ah, great poet,

Your soul forever shines with light,

Your tragic singing,

Forever resounding in

People's hearts!

Ah, great poet,

Boiling blood,

Like the rushing Xiang River!

Noble personality,

Forever as radiant as the sun and moon,

Though suffering ruthless exile.

You will not bow your head

And walk into the temples of other countries,

You are—

Born in Chu ponds,

Died in the Xiang River.

Your wandering soul,

Still lingers around the palaces of the homeland!

The inexhaustible Xiang River,

Buries

Your proud bones, pure and untainted,

But cannot bury!

Your spirit of the ages,

Your tragic singing!

Singing, singing,

Forever flying in the human world!

Ah, boundless Miluo River,

Boundless waves of the ages,

Forever angry,

Forever sad.

Rushing towards the sun, rushing towards the moon—

The Xiang River, where tragic songs are sung!

### Seasonable Rumors

— Cao Juren

Every "festival" accumulates a series of unfounded legends. These rumors are reviewed once a year. Son after son, grandson after grandson, are passed down from generation to generation. The predecessors said so, and the later generations believe so. It is just to celebrate the occasion.

It is unbelievable that the Dragon Boat Festival commemorates the Chu poet Qu Yuan's drowning himself in the river. Qu Yuan did not drown himself on May 5th, and the sacrificial ritual of throwing horn-shaped rice dumplings into the river was already popular during the Warring States period. It is said to be in memory of Wu Zixu, which is also a legend. It probably sees a ritual of worshipping gods between Jing and Chu, which has nothing to do with Wu Zixu, let alone Qu Yuan. Later generations attached their words to it, saying it "as if it were a big deal," just to fool honest people!

The Zhong Jinshi Kui, who catches ghosts, is said to be a person of the Tang Dynasty, which is also unbelievable. There was already a legend of "Zhong Kui" in the Han Dynasty. The divine talisman used this divine appearance. Later, it changed from New Year's Day to the Dragon Boat Festival, and Cangpu made swords and Ai Ye became flags, also holding the position of Zhang Tianshi. His original name was Zhong Kui. Later, his surname was changed to "Zhong" and he was renamed Kui, using the name of a Jinshi to cheat for thousands of years. The "Kui" family is a peach god, and there is suspicion that he and Zhang Ling of the late Han Dynasty colluded to do evil. As for using peach whips to drive away ghosts, it already existed between the Yin and Zhou dynasties, or it may even be a game for the ghost-worshipping Yin people!

In the generation where DDT is popular, we still believe in the magic power of "realgar wine". The future of our nation is terrible! To say what meaning the Dragon Boat Festival has, it only proves our own "stupidity" and "cultural backwardness"! Bah!

### Zhong Kui Expels Ghosts

— Bake

The Tianzhong Ji quotes Tang Yishi as saying:

Emperor Ming of Tang was sick with malaria, and he dreamt of a ghost, with a broken hat, blue robe, horn belt, and court boots, catching small ghosts and eating them. He claimed to be Zhong Kui, a Jinshi from Zhongnan, who had failed the exam many times and died after striking the steps. Emperor Ming awoke and was cured of his illness, so he ordered Wu Daozi to paint his portrait.

There are many ghosts and monsters in the world. Since Emperor Ming of Tang had a dream, everyone knows that "everything overcomes everything." Zhongnan Jinshi can ward off ghosts. Continuing to this day, he is revered as a god and ranks as an expert, which is quite respected by the world. Every Dragon Boat Festival, everyone believes that this ghost-expelling expert will once again show his power and drive away ghosts for the people. Some strike him with a hammer, some catch him and eat him, so that demons and monsters flee at the sound of the wind, invincible everywhere. Therefore, every year on this day, Mr. Zhong Kui can do a lot of good for the people, making them more stable in the coming year. Without Zhongnan Jinshi, this world would probably become a world of ghosts.

Confucius advocated respecting ghosts and gods but keeping them at a distance, which shows that even though he was a sage, he was not able to get along with ghosts and gods. In the past, people regarded tigers, centipedes, toads, spiders, and snakes as the five poisons, and the five poisons were like the five ghosts, which must be driven away completely before there could be peace. Today, the five ghosts and five poisons are even more rampant. Tigers are engaged in the black market, centipedes are enthusiastic about speculation, toads are skillfully seizing and taking, spiders are endlessly corrupt, and snakes have always been licentious and shameless, and naturally become even more intensified. As for the poor ghosts, hungry ghosts, stupid ghosts, bitter ghosts, and evil ghosts, they are united and are showing great ambitions, planning to divide up the world.

People have long been made restless by the five poisons and five ghosts, so they are extremely happy when the Dragon Boat Festival arrives. Seeing Zhong Kui arrive, they will surely be able to either strike or eat, drive away or extinguish the group of ghosts, so that this world of demons and monsters can still restore its light. However, I only hope that today's Zhong Kui will only eat and not drive, because we must eliminate evil completely, and I am afraid that if we drive them away, they will come back again, and they will be even more rampant. By this day next year, we will have suffered enough for a year.

I am still a little worried that the civilization of the twentieth century has made the ghosts also know how to protect themselves with disguise and pretense. Perhaps they will wear mandarin jackets and satin robes, or perhaps they will wear suits and leather shoes, so that it will be impossible to distinguish between humans and ghosts. If Mr. Zhong Kui also knows modern detective techniques, then he probably will not be wearing a horn belt, court boots, a blue robe, and a broken hat when he arrives this time.

Since the festival has arrived, I wish everyone to be like Emperor Ming of Tang, dreaming of Zhong Kui in the day, and recovering from illness upon waking. Not only will they recover from illness, but perhaps your situation and your world will be filled with splendor and hope after a dream!

### Just Right

— Hulu

### Feelings on the Dragon Boat Festival

The Miluo River chokes with grievances, who cherishes and mourns, Qu Yuan's plaint? Year after year, "dragon boats" compete, those playing in the tide, sing and dance in delight!

I advise you not to continue the Li Sao fu, the new era, values power and force! Ling Jun was misled by a dead end, ask the heavens, empty grief Chu!

Note: In the past, there was a nobleman called "Competing Boat", who was said to only seek profit! Recorded in "Wen Jian Hou Lu".

Dragon Boat Festival Special Page

### Do Not Waste the Holiday

— Qi Lou

Passing a holiday is nothing more than bringing joy. It is an embellishment in the monotonous routine of the year. Some holidays were originally commemorated to mourn someone, but over time, the sorrowful emotions cannot withstand the erosion of time and will fade to almost nothing, and the meaning of remembrance is completely lost, eventually turning into a holiday for seeking happiness. The Dragon Boat Festival is the best example. Now, if you ask an ordinary person what the zongzi today are used to sacrifice, I am afraid that hardly one in a hundred could answer.

Humans are animals that like to "seek happiness." Perhaps humanity has not perished to this day because of this. Only those who are terminally ill can be serious all day without a smile. As the saying goes, "finding joy in bitterness" is the true meaning of life. Without it, one cannot survive. We see neighbors around us who, even in very difficult circumstances, are willing to raise money to celebrate a festival. Do not laugh at them for wasting money, and do not advise them to save money. Think about it, what other meaning does life have for them besides this rare opportunity to eat, drink, and have a good time?

Admittedly, many holidays are superstitious. However, if a person has no attachment at all, they will lose their psychological support. Moreover, this kind of belief among Chinese people at most only costs a couple of coins. It will never lead to conflicts between countries and the tragedy of massacres. When the New Culture Movement first arose, we once put forward the slogan of anti-religion. Looking back now, religion is definitely not our enemy. Many great scientists today have faith in gods, but this belief does not hinder their research in science. Our great enemies are ignorance and selfishness, as well as poverty, disease, and natural disasters, not our superstitions, or even various customs and habits that are called陋俗 (lòu sú, outdated and unenlightened customs).

Therefore, when we encounter the New Year or other festivals, we should honestly enjoy ourselves to the fullest. Let us drink a few more cups of realgar wine, inhale more of the smoke of mugwort leaves, let our children wear tiger clothes and paint the character "王" (king) on their foreheads, let the hermit scholars from Zhongnan Mountain catch ghosts on the walls, and let the officials of Chu accompany us to eat a few more zongzi. In short, let us revel in this ancient custom, and when we wake up, increase a little national self-confidence and a little courage to live on!

### Chongqing Dragon Boat Races

— Xia Qijun

Every year around the Dragon Boat Festival in Chongqing, there are various dragon boat races on the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. First, the neighborhood raises funds, and then the young men who love rowing wear uniforms, sit in specially made narrow dragon boats several feet long, beat gongs and drums, and shout primitive songs. The shadows of the paddles and the sound of the songs form a melody. At the bow of the boat, a person stands with their back to the boat, waving their hands, like the conductor of an orchestra. When boatmen set off firecrackers, they quickly circle around. They dance and swirl heroically and joyfully in the rolling yellow waves of the river. Residents look down from the high banks, and the scene is magnificent.

### Is Being Born on the Dragon Boat Festival Unlucky?

— Qiren

In the old Chinese society, which hoped for "great luck in everything," the old concepts have not been reformed even today, which is truly a sad thing. The old habits of parents who "fear auspicious days and are bound by taboos," calculating fate and arranging birthdates, still prevail. I wonder when they will truly be abolished?

Unfortunately, I had a child born on the Dragon Boat Festival. The elders anxiously said that he clashed with me and feared that unlucky things would happen. They insisted on giving him away for adoption. I tried my best to oppose it, but to no avail.

Everyone else is happy to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, but I alone feel disgusted when the Dragon Boat Festival comes. I regret that I failed to persuade my elders in the past, which led to my beloved child, whom my wife and I conceived, being given away to establish a separate household. This is our greatest loss and vexation.

Is being born on the Dragon Boat Festival really unlucky? Our old ancestors opposed this fallacy long ago. Why hasn't this fallacy been abolished even now?

Wang Chong's Lunheng Fuxu chapter says: "Lord Mengchang of Qi, Tian Wen, was born on the fifth day of the fifth month. His father, Tian Ying, rebuked his mother, saying, 'Why did you give birth to him?' She said, 'Why shouldn't you raise a child born in the fifth month?' Ying said, 'A child born in the fifth month grows to be the same height as the door and kills his parents.' She said, 'Is human life in heaven or in the door? If it is in heaven, what are you worried about? If it is in the door, then it is appropriate to raise the door higher. Who can reach him?' Later, Wen grew to be the same height as a door, but Ying did not die. Therefore, the taboo against raising children born in the fifth month is ineffective.'"

Wang Zhen'e of the Southern History was also born on the fifth day of the fifth month. His family, due to the common taboo, wanted to have him adopted into a distant ancestral line. Meng said, "This is no ordinary child. In the past, Lord Mengchang was born in an unlucky month and became the prime minister of Qi. This child will also bring prosperity to our family." Therefore, he was named Zhen'e.

After all, Wang Meng was a knowledgeable and learned person. He knew the story of Tian Wen, so he did not give his son away for adoption. Although I also knew these stories, I did not have the perseverance to insist against my father. Who dares to say that my child will definitely not become as famous as Tian Wen and Wang Zhen'e in the future? Moreover, if he can be well-educated and become famous, then what misfortune will he bring to me? There is nothing to fear or avoid. The older generation should be the stepping stones for the younger generation. It is right to sacrifice oneself to let them grow strong and healthy.

The worst examples of people born on the fifth day of the fifth month are only two: one is Gao Chuo of the Northern Qi, who was executed for treason; the other is Emperor Huizong of the Northern Song, whose country was destroyed and his family perished, and he died as a prisoner in the hands of the Jin people.

However, the reasons for Gao Chuo and Emperor Huizong's downfall were due to their arbitrariness and tyranny, and their weakness and incompetence, which were unrelated to their birthday on the fifth day of the fifth month. This is something that anyone with a little common sense knows. However, in the old Chinese society, there are still people who believe in this ignorant custom, which can truly be said to be an absurd and strange thing!

### Ghostly Delusion

— Ye Miao

### Thinking of Zhong Kui on the Dragon Boat Festival

— Yifeng

Red mugwort and green artemisia, the Dragon Boat Festival arrives again.

The customs of the Dragon Boat Festival are extremely numerous: dragon boat races, wrapping glutinous rice into zongzi, supposedly to commemorate the Three Officials of Chu, a minister who drowned himself in the river out of patriotism and sorrow for the times. Naturally, this great poet of the generation is worthy of our mourning, especially for his "Li Sao", which has influenced countless poets and writers in later generations.

In fact, whether the general public really knows about Qu Yuan is probably only a few. It's just that this is a happy holiday anyway, so the big bosses of the shops can take the opportunity to make a fortune, and the farmers can take a day off. Especially the children, who have food, clothes, and games, are even more welcome on this day.

However, the situation is a bit different today. The rich celebrate the festival, but for the poor, it may be a "calamity." No matter how overwhelmed they are, they have to find a way to pretend to be rich and put on a show for themselves. Therefore, my childhood feelings for this "good calamity" have long disappeared, and I have few places to miss it. If I had to say there was anything, it would be Zhong Kui, who expels ghosts?

The myths about Zhong Kui are widely spread in unofficial histories and novels. As a child, I was both happy and afraid of this black-faced, blue-robed deity. Now, I have no intention of writing a biography for him or verifying anything, and there is no need to delve into the origins. However, what the Kaiyuan Yishi said is quite interesting. It says: "Emperor Ming of Tang dreamed that a small ghost, dressed in a red diaper, barefoot on one foot and shod on the other, with a shoe hanging from his waist, stole Empress Yang's embroidered sachets. The emperor rebuked him. The ghost replied, 'I am Xu Hao (消耗, consumption, depletion).' The emperor was angry and wanted to call for guards. Suddenly, he saw a large ghost, wearing a broken hat, a blue robe, a fish belt, and court boots, directly grabbing the small ghost, gouging out its eyes, and devouring it. The emperor asked, 'Who are you?' He replied, 'I am Zhong Kui, a scholar from Zhongnan Mountain!'" Although this story is absurd and unfounded, the story of Zhong Kui expelling ghosts may have originated from this.

Nowadays, some people liken China to a "plague zone" because in this "plague zone," human and material resources are "depleted" endlessly. Isn't it like the small ghost "Xu Hao" is causing trouble? Therefore, how can we get ten thousand good people like Zhong Kui to go and catch them, gouge out their eyes, and devour them, so that the world can be brought to a state of peace?

### Looking at the Dragon Boat Festival from a New Perspective

— Ke Ti

The annual Dragon Boat Festival is approaching in an instant. According to traditional customs, there will inevitably be a round of "inserting artemisia, racing dragon boats, and drinking realgar wine" in various places. However, these long-standing folk customs have some superstitious associations and do not have any practical significance.

Some people say that the Dragon Boat Festival is to commemorate the extraordinary figure Qu Yuan, but this statement is not necessarily entirely true. However, from the perspective of seasonal arrangement, the competitive nature is very appropriate and meaningful in the Dragon Boat Festival.

If we look at the Dragon Boat Festival from a new perspective, I believe that a competition (not dragon boat races) is worthy of being widely held among the people in various places, which is a kind of exhibition with a competitive nature that encourages the improvement of agricultural products and handicrafts in our country. Various methods are used to evaluate the best agricultural products (such as vegetables, melons, fruits, etc.) and handicrafts (such as embroidery, weaving, crafts, etc.) and reward them, so as to improve varieties and techniques. This way of improving production in the commemorative festival is more meaningful.

When Chinese people celebrate festivals and the New Year, they mostly only have meaningless consumption and lack the meaning of active construction. I believe that this point needs to be thoroughly reformed.

### Mooncakes Should Be Eaten on the Dragon Boat Festival

— Sun Fuxi

The Dragon Boat Festival is a festival of the lunar calendar and has no commemorative value. After the Xinhai Revolution, people with thoughts and education tried their best to break superstitions and attack the festivals of the lunar calendar. Between the May Fourth Movement and the National Revolution, in order to introduce Western democracy and science, they especially hated and criticized the old etiquette and old habits. However, the masses and educated and thoughtful people were all involved, and some were greedy, some were conservative, and some were lazy about "celebrating the New Year and festivals." They followed the customs, so the ancient Doubter Qian Xuantong painfully and indignantly "advocated eating mooncakes on the Dragon Boat Festival and zongzi on the Mid-Autumn Festival."

At that time, I had just returned from abroad and saw that Chinese festivals such as New Year's Day and Double Ten Day were far less enthusiastic than foreign festivals. Therefore, I advocated promoting old festivals and refreshing the meaning of festivals. Among them, there was a passage that was slightly disrespectful to Mr. Qian Xuantong. I said: "If we don't make it clear to understand the meaning of the festival, then the mooncakes of the Dragon Boat Festival will become zongzi again. At that time, we will have to trouble Mr. Qian Xuantong to advocate changing the zongzi eaten on the Mid-Autumn Festival to be eaten on the Dragon Boat Festival."

The Dragon Boat Festival, as a festival, was a sanitation festival at that time, a day for cleaning. It was especially valued in the hot climate of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei. This is worthy of legal meaning. Secondly, the Dragon Boat Festival is a literary festival, commemorating Qu Yuan's drowning in the river, so dragon boat races are meant to be a competition to save the Minister of Chu. In fact, it is to promote sports, such as boat races and swimming performances, just as the Qingming Festival and Cold Food Festival commemorate Jie Zitui, and promote outings and enjoying the spring.

Our zongzi are not for people to eat. The original intention was to wrap the rice so that it could be easily thrown into the river to commemorate Minister Qu. After knowing this meaning, eating zongzi feels more meaningful.

Now the old festivals have become meaningless, and the new festivals have not been fully developed. In Chinese folk customs, there are few things used to cultivate emotions and hang up spirituality. All that exists is gifts and gluttony.

Now the stores start selling zongzi and mooncakes three or four months before the festival. From the perspective of making money and business competition, it is indeed commendable for their diligence, but when the festival arrives, these meaningful souvenirs have long become meaningless. From now on, the sale of zongzi should be limited to within seven days before and after the Dragon Boat Festival. Is this the government's responsibility?

### Memories of the Dragon Boat Festival

— Feng Zikai

In the comics of folk life that I write, there is often the character "王" (king) on the door. Readers do not understand its meaning. Some think that the family in this door is surnamed Wang. In my art exhibition in Chongqing, someone re-ordered a painting of this kind and specially told the person in charge of ordering the pieces at the exhibition hall, saying: "Please ask him to change the character '王' on the door to the character '李' when he paints. Because my surname is Li." This buyer of the painting regarded the painting as his own home, and his attitude of appreciation can be said to be extremely special! And my writing the character "王" on the door can also be said to be the ultimate in sloppiness! Because this character "王" on the door was originally written with realgar wine at noon on the Dragon Boat Festival. When I was young, I saw every household in my hometown doing this, so I will do so. How could I know that this method is only limited to a certain area; and only limited to my childhood. Now everyone is too lazy to follow the ancients in doing this. It is also no wonder that many readers do not understand the meaning of this character "王".

When I was young, that is, more than forty years ago, the Dragon Boat Festival in my hometown was very grand: My eldest sister started making "tiger heads" a month in advance, preparing to give them to children in her own and relatives' families to wear on this day. Qi Guan, the shop assistant in the dyeing shop, was busy making calamus swords on the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival: He collected many calamus leaves from the wild pond, selected the leaves that were most shaped like宝剑, added a sword handle, and prepared to hang them together with peach leaves on everyone's bed at noon. My mother was busy "burning mosquito smoke" and catching spiders: She bought a large bag of Atractylodes lancea and Dahurian angelica from the pharmacy, put them in a fire pot, let them emit a fragrance, and took them to smoke in every room. At the same time, she bought many eggs, knocked a small hole on the top of each one, put a spider in it, sealed the hole with paper, and simmered the eggs in a mosquito smoke stove. After simmering, she opened the eggs, took out the spider carcasses, and gave the eggs to the children to eat. At noon, she put a pack of realgar in a large bowl of Shaoxing wine, mixed it well, and asked Qi Guan to take it to every corner of the room and spray it with his mouth. The remaining thick realgar was dipped with a finger and the character "王" was written on each door; and the character "王" was written on the forehead of each child; and a little was scooped up with a finger and stuffed into the navel of each child. It is said that tiger heads, peach leaves, and calamus swords can drive away evil spirits; simmered spider eggs can get rid of diseases; Atractylodes lancea, Dahurian angelica, and realgar can drive away poisonous insects and poisonous gas. As for the character "王" on the door, it is said to be a reserve of disinfectant medicine; if someone is bitten by centipedes or snakes in the future, they can scoop up a little of the good medicine made at noon on the Dragon Boat Festival from the door, apply it to the affected area, and it can disinfect and relieve pain.

The world is impermanent. Now, such ancient ways can no longer be seen. The face of the Dragon Boat Festival is completely different from the past. I only remember this character "王" on the door. It is not to be used as a DTT, but as an embellishment on the door in the painting. It is strangely monotonous to paint a door bare; and it is not good-looking to draw something on the door that looks like a house number. Only this character "王" has both the effect of decoration and the meaning of remembrance and commemoration of the Dragon Boat Festival. In the past, when Japan abolished paper umbrellas and popularised "bat umbrellas" (that is, cloth umbrellas), Japanese painters greatly regretted it. Because in city streetscapes with too many straight lines, the round-lined paper umbrellas had a great contrasting effect. Sometimes, the entire composition of a city streetscape painting relied on a paper umbrella to add color; and the contrasting effect of bat umbrellas is far less than that of paper umbrellas. Now, my mood is similar to that of the Japanese painters at that time. From a practical point of view, this is close to cutting the feet to fit the shoes. This is originally "the inhumanity of art."

### A Dragon Boat Festival Story

— Shen

In the past, there was a talented woman who married a poor husband. When the Dragon Boat Festival arrived, she was unable to celebrate the festival. So she composed a quatrain: "I lament my poor fate for marrying a poor husband. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and I have nothing. It is not appropriate to waste the good festival in vain, so I will use clear water to cultivate calamus." Her husband was saddened by the poem and went out to relieve his depression. He saw an ox wandering in the middle of the road without a shepherd. He happily said to himself that heaven was pitying his poverty and giving him an ox, so he reported it and went home. As he entered, the ox's owner tracked him down, seized him, and took him to the official. The official ascended the hall to question him. The scholar told him about his wife's poem. The official did not believe him and ordered the officer to escort the scholar to bring her. The official asked if she could indeed compose poetry. He ordered her to take an examination on the spot, using the character "ox" as the topic. The talented woman immediately wrote a quatrain:

"The surging river flows eastward, it is difficult to describe the shame on my face today. Since I have never been the Weaver Girl, why are you imitating the Cowherd?"

The official was greatly surprised, then pointed to the red plum on the wall and ordered her to compose another poem. She quickly wrote another quatrain:

"Jade bones and ice muscles emerge from the snow. Who used a vermilion brush to dot the branches? The shepherd boy wakes up with blurry eyes and mistakenly recognizes the peach blossoms as wanting to release the ox."

The official greatly praised their talent and generously rewarded the couple for the holiday.
