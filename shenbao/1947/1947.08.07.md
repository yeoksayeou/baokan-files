[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Chief of the General Staff Chen Cheng flew from Nanjing at 9:00 AM this morning on a special plane for an inspection tour.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] Chief Chen, accompanied by over twenty aides, arrived in Shenyang at 1:30 PM this afternoon on a special plane from Nanjing. Director Xiong and others welcomed him at the airport.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 6th] Last night, the National Army in Jilin secretly crossed the Songhua River north of Wula Street and reached Baiqitun. They are currently conducting search and mop-up operations on the east bank of the Songhua River.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 6th] The National Army in Yidu continued to pursue the retreating five columns of Chen Yi on the 6th. By evening, the vanguard had crossed Xiajiazhuang and Xiaoying, approaching the east bank of the Zi River. Another route, from Linqu and Jiangyu, pursued the National Army southeast, also reaching the vicinity of Daguan on the 6th.

[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 6th] The highway from Jining via Wenshang, Dongping, and Dong'a to Jinan was reopened on the 5th, with the remaining bandits retreating to the west bank of the Grand Canal. Furthermore, the highway between Jinan and Yanzhou is now open, and there are no traces of bandits in the triangular area between the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Yellow River, and the Grand Canal.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 6th] With the recovery of Yidu, the Communist bandits' resistance was not fierce. Many believe this symbolizes the depletion of their forces. The National Army now finds itself in an increasingly advantageous position in the central Shandong war situation. The National Army is dividing its forces to suppress bandits towards Zibo and Boshan. Battles are unfolding from the outskirts of Boshan to Tusikou. The equipment and families of the Zibo bandit army are being evacuated to Huantai, indicating a wavering and preparations for a northward retreat. It is expected that the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway can be reopened sooner than expected.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 6th] After defeating the Communist bandits west of the Dagu River, a unit of the National Army entered Jiaoxian City on the 5th and is currently mopping up the remaining bandits in the surrounding areas.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 6th] The equipment of the remaining bandits in the southwestern and central Shandong areas of Linzi and Huantai is being transported north across the river. The National Air Force has been bombing over a hundred crossings of the Yellow River and the Xiaoqing River used by the Communist bandits for days, with great success.

[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 6th] The major annihilation battle in southwestern Shandong is proceeding intensely. The National Army is confident of victory. The remaining troops of Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi, originally surrounded by the National Army, including Chen Yi's 1st, 4th, 8th, and 14th Columns and the 13th Division of the 5th Column, after days of encirclement and attack by the National Army, had only about 20,000 men left. On the night of the 4th, they broke through and fled west of the Grand Canal, attempting to merge with Liu Bocheng's troops and then flee north across the Yellow River. Starting on the 5th, after being夹盘 by units pursuing them across the Grand Canal via Jiaxiang and Yuncheng, the bandits were again surrounded in the area between Wenkou and Dachanggou and are currently being encircled. The remaining troops of Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns, after days of regrouping, made a desperate attempt against the National Army in Huangkou and Linhuaiji. Although Jikou was invaded due to the disparity in numbers, and some of the remaining bandits forcibly crossed the Yellow River, they fled rapidly towards Guanxian via Puxian and Yanggu. However, their main force is still surrounded by the National Army in the central area of Linpuji, Zhongdui, and Fantun and will be easily annihilated. For days, the National Air Force has been bombing hundreds of boats and dozens of crossings set up by the Communist bandits along the river, day and night. Thousands of Communist bandits have been bombed and fallen into the river every day.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The National Army in Hebei has launched a mop-up operation in the triangular area of Beiping, Tianjin, and Baoding. The encirclement began from three directions on the morning of the 6th, with the goal of converging at Yongqing and Chaoxian. One route advances eastward from Anxin and Rongcheng, one route advances southward from Anci, and one route advances westward from Yangliuqing and Shengfang south of Tianjin. It is expected that this triangular area will be cleared up soon.

### Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan; Ministry of Economy is Actively Organizing; Difficulties in Returning Items Plundered by Japan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan is being actively organized by the Ministry of Economy. After this organization is established, the candidates for the business delegation to Japan will be reviewed by it and then approved and announced by the Executive Yuan. It is said that the delegation will not be able to depart until September 1st at the earliest. Furthermore, Wu Yun-chu, Chairman of the Industrial Association, will hold a reception for the press after arriving in Nanjing on the 7th to report on his views on opening trade with Japan.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Wu Ban-nong, head of the Compensation and Return Group of the Chinese Delegation to Japan, stated: Although it is known that a large number of items plundered from China exist in Japan, the return of these stolen goods is extremely difficult due to insufficient evidence provided by the original Chinese owners or because the methods of request are inappropriate. At least the return date will be greatly delayed. Some owners only stated that their property was plundered by the Japanese, but failed to provide evidence to prove that they owned the items to support their claims. Such applications that do not comply with procedures require the Chinese delegation to exchange letters with the Chinese government seven or eight times before obtaining forms that can be accepted by the Allied authorities. Chinese owners are not clear about the procedures for requesting returns, so the return date of the items is delayed for a long time. Among the items plundered from China by Japan, there are 130 ships, 20 factories (mostly plundered from Guangzhou), a number of cars, and other items. However, only a small number of ships and factories have been returned to their original owners so far. Official procedures and the inefficiency of the Japanese government have greatly delayed the return date. The Chinese delegation submits 15 to 20 applications every week, but has not received any results. Those who apply for the return of items should first submit documents or photos to prove their ownership, submit a registration certificate, and briefly describe the time, place, and circumstances of the item being plundered. For example, in the case of a car, the engine and chassis numbers should be provided. If the certificate of ownership or registration certificate is lost or destroyed, assistance can be provided by sales stores or customs in the United States and other countries. In short, if the owner cannot provide sufficient evidence to prove his request, the return of the plundered items will be delayed for a long time.

### Problems with the Peace Conference with Japan; US Will Inform the Soviet Union

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Well-informed sources here say that if the situation with the Soviet Union can be clarified in time, the United States will issue invitations to countries to attend the peace conference with Japan in early September. The United States will inform the Soviet Union in the next day or two, correcting the Soviet statement that the treaty should be drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference and that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should not participate in the peace conference on an equal footing. If the Soviet Union still insists on its position, the United States will consult with other countries. If a majority of countries agree that the Soviet Union's participation is not necessary, then the United States will proceed with the matter and issue invitations immediately.

In addition, it is learned that Australian Ambassador Makin informed the State Department that the Australian government believes that the proposed representation standards for convening the peace conference by the United States should have higher standards. The Australian government hopes that its Foreign Minister can participate in this peace conference from the beginning, which means that it does not approve of convening a meeting of Deputy Foreign Ministers. According to officials, the United States will not insist on its position and may first have the main personnel conduct this meeting and then hold a meeting of Deputy Foreign Ministers.

Regarding the Japanese peace treaty, China advocates that all resolutions should be established after the consent of three of the four major powers (China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and two-thirds of the eleven countries. The United States believes that China made this proposal because it fears that modifying the veto power will endanger its interests. Regarding the issue of retaining Japan's substantial economic recovery capabilities, it is said that China's position is also inconsistent with that of the United Kingdom and the United States. Now that China advocates a two-thirds vote procedure, it may be able to obtain the support of the Soviet Union to maintain China's position. However, if the compensation issue still cannot be resolved by the Far Eastern Commission when the peace conference with Japan is convened, then China can only rely on the support of the United States to obtain a larger allocation.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 6th, broadcast: Hawaiian Congressman Farrington suggested that the peace treaty with Japan should be signed in Hawaii, saying that the Pacific War broke out here and that it is located in the center of the Pacific, so Hawaii is the most ideal place to sign the peace treaty with Japan.

### President Chiang's Golden Statue

Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon Dedicate Funds to Cast [Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th] The Overseas Chinese Dedication Committee in Hong Kong and Kowloon began casting President Chiang's golden statue on the afternoon of the 5th. The gold used was all donated by overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Kowloon after the war. The golden statue is a half-length portrait of President Chiang without a hat, wearing the uniform of a Grand Marshal. The statue work will take about five days to complete, and it will be presented to President Chiang after completion.

### To Stop Large-Scale Smuggling in Hong Kong and Macao; We Have Adopted Strict Measures; Dong Xian-guang and Ye Gong-chao Answer Reporters' Questions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Executive Yuan Information Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM today. Director Dong Xian-guang answered reporters' questions as follows:

(Question) The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) suggested transporting 50,000 tons of relief supplies to the Communist areas. Does the government agree? Is it reasonable for UNRRA to stop transporting materials to North China?

(Answer) The government is extremely concerned about the people who have suffered for a long time in the Communist areas. It hopes that the UNRRA materials can really reach the hands of the people in the Communist areas. If it does not contradict the above-mentioned purpose of relieving the people, then the government does not oppose the transport of materials to the Communist areas. As for whether it is reasonable for UNRRA to temporarily stop transporting materials to North China, it seems appropriate to leave it to UNRRA to answer.

(Question) Which of the items imported by Fu Chung and Yangtze companies does the government consider to violate import regulations?

(Answer) According to the investigation report released by the Ministry of Finance on August 1st, none of the items imported by Fu Chung and Yangtze companies violated import regulations. Fu Chung Company handled two Cadillac cars on behalf of customers. At first, the customs did not allow them to be released. Later, it was proven that the two cars were used old cars, manufactured in 1942, and were declared on behalf of customers, not for sale, so they could be imported according to law.

(Question) What is the Chinese government's estimate of the amount of smuggling imported from Hong Kong and Macao? What are the main items of smuggling? It is falsely rumored in Manila that a large amount of gold is imported from Macao. Is this true? What steps has the government taken to stop smuggling? Has it asked the authorities in Hong Kong, Macao, the United Kingdom, and Portugal to help stop smuggling?

(Answer) It is difficult, if not impossible, to make even a rough estimate of the amount of smuggling from Hong Kong and Macao. According to the statistics for 1946, the value of smuggled import and export goods confiscated throughout the country was about 11.3 billion yuan. The main items of smuggled imports were wool textiles, cigarettes, soap, soda, cosmetics, cotton yarn, ginseng, and flour, with wool textiles being the most important. The smuggled export items, all passing through Hong Kong and Macao, were tungsten, eggs, silver coins, and domestic medicinal materials. Regarding the smuggling of gold from Macao, we have not heard of it. The government has taken various strict measures to stop smuggling. Recently, the number of anti-smuggling personnel stationed near the border of Hong Kong has been doubled, and the equipment for anti-smuggling has also been greatly improved. In addition to the original anti-smuggling vessels, fast vessels have been added.

Regarding the issue of smuggling from Hong Kong and Macao, Vice Minister Ye Gong-chao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following supplementary report: The Chinese government expresses serious concern about the increasing amount of smuggling from Hong Kong and Macao. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly requested the British Foreign Office and the Hong Kong government to establish an effective anti-smuggling agreement with us as soon as possible, but the British side has not responded. Although China has been studying strict anti-smuggling measures and preparing to implement them on our border, it still hopes that the British government will also understand the seriousness of this issue and effectively stop the large amount of smuggling in and out of Hong Kong based on the cooperative anti-smuggling methods agreed upon by both China and the United Kingdom.

(Question) What are Director Dong's opinions on the remarks of Professor Pei Fa of the United States regarding advocating for the cessation of aid to China to promote reform?

(Answer) Professor Fei recently published an article "The Time to Withdraw from China," in which he stated that there are three options for stopping the Soviet Union's development in China: (1) The Chinese government implements political reforms. Pei said that this will take time. (2) The United States stations at least one million troops on the Chinese border, but he said that this is not permitted by American public opinion. (3) The United States withdraws from China and at the same time makes the Soviet Union take the same action. It is said that this is the only way to avoid war with the Soviet Union. Pei's article seems to imply that China is a breeding ground for international war. I should state that China has absolutely no intention of dragging the United States or other countries into war. China has suffered greatly from past wars. If there is another war, it will be harmful to us and not beneficial. What Fei said about China needing to reform its politics is a constructive suggestion. However, if he misinterprets China's political reform as a superficial gesture in order to obtain financial assistance from abroad, it will only expose his lack of understanding of China's national policy. China has been promoting political reform for a considerable amount of time, but the reason why it has not achieved remarkable results is because the Communist bandits' rebellion is always an obstacle. Although the government has its shortcomings, if China can hold a public opinion poll, it is deeply believed that the vast majority of the people will still support the government and despise the Communist bandits who create chaos and profit from it.

### Second Protest Against the Beitashan Incident; We Received a Reply from the Soviet Union; Vice Minister Ye Said the Government is Considering It

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Vice Minister Ye Gong-chao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs answered questions about diplomatic issues at the press conference of the Information Bureau on the 6th as follows:

Question: Regarding the second protest against the Xinjiang incident, has the British, Soviet, or foreign side replied?

Answer: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a note from the Soviet government on August 5, replying to the Chinese government's second protest against the Beitashan incident. Our government is currently considering it based on the new reply from the Soviet side.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Ye Gong-chao said that China had submitted a counter-proposal to the British draft of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty to the British Foreign Office nearly six months ago, but the British side has not yet clarified its position. This may be due to changes in the situation in India, Burma, and Malaya.

### Additional Budget for the Next Five Months; Approximately 1.4 Trillion; Uniform Treatment for Civil and Military Officials to be Implemented This Month

### Standing Committee of the Central Committee Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday; Approved the Agenda of the Fourth Plenary Session; Li Jishen Incited Civil Rebellion, Expelled from the Party

### Democratic Socialist Party Splits Again; Central Personnel Already Decided by the Standing Committee; Reformers Break Away from the Mother Body; Wu Xianzis' 代主氏

[Our City Report] The Democratic Socialist Party held its first Standing Committee meeting after the National Congress at 9:00 AM yesterday. Sixteen standing committee members attended, chaired by Zhang Junmai. In addition to discussing general routine cases, it was resolved to reorganize the central personnel as follows: (1) Secretary-General: Jin Houcheng, Deputy Secretary-Generals: Yang Yuzi, Sun Yafu, (2) Director of the Organization Department: Zhan Yiqiao, Deputy Directors: Cheng Qizhi, Feng Jinbai, (3) Director of the Propaganda Department: Xu Chuanlin, Deputy Directors: Jiang Yuntian, Cui Xinyi, (4) Director of the Social Affairs Department: Wu Zheng, Deputy Directors: Chen Tao-kun, Li Zhizhen, (5) Director of the Overseas Department: Yang Lingming (acting), Deputy Directors: Yang Tanming, Zheng Tianxie, (6) Director of the Women's Department: Luo Jingxuan, Deputy Director: Chen Dingxiu, (7) Director of the Election Office: Wang Shixian, (8) Executive Director of the Political Research Committee: Li Wei, (9) Secretary of the Standing Committee: Liu Zhongyi, (10) Spokesperson: Cui Xin, (11) Representative in Nanjing: Jiang Yuntian.

[Our Report] The "Reform Committee" and the "Overseas General Branches" of the Democratic Socialist Party held a reception for the press at 3:30 PM yesterday, issuing a joint statement with the following main points: (1) They do not recognize the National Congress convened by the Democratic Socialist Party. (2) The Democratic Socialist Party was formed by the merger of the National Socialist Party and the Overseas Democratic Constitutional Party. Now the Reformers and Overseas Party members have joined forces, accounting for three-quarters of the party's total strength according to the party's constituent forces. (3) They elected Vice-Chairman Wu Xianzi as the acting chairman and scheduled the first congress to be held in Shanghai on August 15. According to key members of the Reformers, "In the future, more than 70 representatives will attend the National Congress, and there will be at least four overseas representatives. Zhang Dongsun has decided to participate, and Fei Xiaotong and Pan Guangdan have not yet made a formal statement. Our internal proposition is peaceful, democratic, and unified. In diplomacy, we advocate a neutral position between the United States and the Soviet Union."

### Local Representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party Also Organize a Friendship Association

[Our Report] In addition to the Reformers and Overseas General Branches, another new dispute has arisen after this National Congress of the Democratic Socialist Party: More than 70 provincial and municipal representatives have formed a friendship association at this congress. They have a strong conflict with the central leadership of the Democratic Socialist Party. According to the attending representatives Wang Renjun and Li Xiangdong, the central leadership used the method of "selecting representatives," making it impossible for the provincial and municipal representatives, who should have been in the majority, to express their opinions at all, and they were in a disadvantageous position in important votes. The election was controlled by a small number of people, and the attending representatives had no supervisory rights over the vote counting, resulting in many abuses. At the same time, the way the representatives were produced lacked democracy. For example, Wu Xingzhi, a central committee member from Guizhou, had already been elected, but Zhang Junmai ordered him to resign. Currently, the central leadership of the Democratic Socialist Party regards the provincial and municipal representatives' friendship association as the "second reform committee," and the friendship association is also determined to fight, hoping to achieve two goals: (1) To get Zhang Junmai on the right track, (2) To clear away the manipulators around Zhang Junxun. At the same time, the representatives of the friendship association pointed out that many key members of the Democratic Socialist Party had suspicions of collaborating with the enemy during the war, and they are currently collecting evidence to make a public accusation.

### River Water Levels Continue to Rise, Bandits Redig Dikes, Flood Area in Northern Jiangsu Expands, Guanyun, Suqian, and Xiao Counties Become Marshlands

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 6th] Rivers in northern Jiangsu have overflowed, and the affected area continues to expand. According to reports today, the water level at Tanshaji on the Grand Canal has reached 26.8 meters, and both the old and new dikes have collapsed. The water level in Huangdun Lake in Suqian is very high, and the dike projects in Zhouguan and Lincheng are in urgent condition. The Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau has been rushing to transport burlap bags, lead wire, etc., overnight and has sent personnel to supervise the emergency repairs. In addition, Guanyun, Suqian, and Xiao counties have also become marshlands due to excessive rainfall and rising river water levels. Today, this reporter inquired with Director Xiao of the Construction Department whether there was a possibility of flooding in the Lixiahe area of northern Jiangsu this year. According to him, the water level in the Grand Canal south of the Huai River has not yet reached a dangerous level. If there are no major changes within ten days, the counties of Dongtai and Taixing in the Lixiahe area may be able to avoid flooding.

[Our Correspondent in Xinpu, 6th] In the Haizhou area, bandit troops recently dug up the Huang Dadi dike on the Chaimihe River again, causing the water level in the flooded area to rise by one foot. The suburbs of Zhuoyun City in Donghai County are several feet deep in water, and the autumn crops have been tragically submerged, leaving millions of people homeless and without food.

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 6th] In view of the increasing severity of the floods in Xuhai and Huaihe, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has telegraphed the counties in northern Jiangsu to mobilize a large labor force to repair the river dikes and has also telegraphed the central government, urging them to expedite the allocation of flour to the counties of Pi, Su, and Sui, which have been hit hardest by the disaster, for emergency distribution. It is reported that more than 1,000 men, women, and children have died from drowning and starvation in Pi County alone, and the disaster victims are crying out for food, making the situation extremely tragic. It is reported that the remaining communist bandits in Huaihai believe that the floods in the Yi and Shu Rivers have caused widespread disasters, bringing trouble to northern Jiangsu, which they see as an opportunity to be seized. They have secretly sent a large number of bandit military and political workers to infiltrate the disaster area and induce disaster victims to join the army. The authorities have telegraphed all counties to take strict precautions and rescue the disaster victims.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 6th] The flooded area in northern Anhui has expanded. Siyang County has been experiencing prolonged rainfall, and the nine townships in the northwest have become marshlands, with the disaster situation being extremely severe and the autumn harvest hopeless. The Huai and Fei Rivers in Shouxian and Fengtai have also risen, and the bridge outside the north gate of Shouxian has been submerged, with the water approaching the city gates.

The diagram on the right is a miniature of the Xuhai flood area, based on reports of the affected counties before July 20.

### Severe Drought in Yikezhao League, Refugees Flee, Many Children Abandoned and Urgently Need Shelter

[Our Correspondent in Guihua, 6th] The Yikezhao League drought inspection team, led by Chang Peisan, crossed the river from Baotou into Yikezhao League on the 4th. According to the team's report to Suiyuan, disaster victims in the Shanbei area of Yikezhao League are fleeing the area in two directions. One route passes through Yikezhao League and heads east to the Shakoutang area of Ningxia, seeking refuge in western Suiyuan. The other route passes through Dongsheng Dalate Banner and crosses the river at Dashuwan to the Baotou area. There is now a large number of famine victims gathered at Dashuwan. On the way, the famine victims cannot support themselves due to hunger and cannot carry their young children. They tie them to trees with ropes, and the parents cry bitterly and leave after the children die. Because the disaster situation in Yi Meng is so tragic, Chang Peisan telegraphed Chairman Dong, instructing the relief agencies in Baotou, Fengzhen, Guihua, and Wuyuan to accommodate the refugees as much as possible to provide relief. Du Pinshan, Director of the Suiyuan Social Affairs Department, has allocated special funds to supplement the relief agencies in various places and has sent special personnel to quickly establish a relief agency in Wuyuan to accommodate the refugee children who have fled to western Suiyuan.

[Our Correspondent in Guihua, 6th] Qi Yongquan, Director of the Provisional Rehabilitation Committee of Jungar Banner in Yikezhao League, sent a telegram on the 29th of last month to Director Zuo Yi and Chairman Dong Qiwu, urgently reporting the drought situation in Jungar Banner. The original telegram read as follows: "The disaster situation in this banner has reached a critical and severe stage. The crops have withered and died due to drought, and people's hearts are panicked and uneasy. Driven by hunger, they are fleeing one after another, with an average of nearly hundreds of households fleeing every day. Many children are abandoned by disaster victims along the way, which is extremely tragic. The method is to bury the child in sand after the child falls asleep, and the parents abandon them with unspeakable grief. Who doesn't have children? Who doesn't love their children? But if there is a glimmer of hope, they would not perform this tragedy. This telegram is submitted urgently. Please provide a large amount of material relief quickly to stabilize the area and save the people's lives."

### Widespread Disaster Area in Hebei, Social Affairs Department Releases Statistics

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] This year's severe drought in Hebei Province has caused a tragic disaster situation.

The disaster situation is most severe in Jixian and Tongxian counties. According to the person in charge of the Hebei Social Affairs Department, the disaster situation in the recovered areas of Hebei Province is also severe, including drought, floods, insect plagues, earthquakes, and communist banditry. According to reports obtained by the department, the number of people affected in 59 counties and cities, including Shijiazhuang, Yongnian, Changyuan, Dongming, Yuanshi, and Zhao County, accounts for more than 76% of their total population, with Shijiazhuang and Yongnian being the worst affected, with the number of people affected accounting for more than 90% of the population in both areas.

### Shanxi Counties Report Disasters and Request Relief

[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 6th] Various counties in Shanxi have reported drought disasters to the provincial government and requested relief to avoid starvation. Traveling south along the Zhengtai Railway, from Taiyuan to Taigu, except for the area near Taigu, where there are many wells and the fields are lush for hundreds of miles, most of the autumn crops are withered. The farmers go to the fields, look up at the sky and sigh, saying, "Good to plant wheat if it rains during the three伏 days." If there is no rain, not only will the autumn harvest be hopeless, but also the sowing of wheat will become a problem.

### Hankou Water Level Continues to Rise

### Government Cooperates with Cotton Textile Industry to Compete for Overseas Sales Market in Southeast Asia, Decides to Assist Production and Sales through Weaving on Commission Basis

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] Recently, several cotton textile manufacturers, in view of the fact that Japanese goods are planning to dump goods in Southeast Asia, have jointly organized production and sales agencies and requested government assistance. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has repeatedly consulted with relevant agencies and has now decided to adopt the principle of weaving on commission. The method is that the government will lend cotton yarn, lend labor costs, and give reasonable profits. The finished products will be collected by the government for export. The detailed production and sales plan is being drafted by the department's competent authority to help reduce the cost of cotton textile products with government assistance, so as to compete for the Southeast Asian market. Cotton textiles belong to the current revised temporary measures for import and export trade, Annex (3) B, and will be temporarily suspended from rotation before a separate announcement is made, so Japanese cotton textiles will not be dumped in our country for the time being. The ways to help reduce the cost of cotton products supplied domestically are: (1) Raise funds to increase domestic cotton production. There are about 40,000 spindles in the country, which requires about 1,200 dan of cotton. It is estimated that the total domestic cotton production this year is about 10 million dan. Except for cotton for self-use (estimated at about 5 million dan), the difference is quite large. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has instructed the former Textile Industry Management Committee to allocate 20 billion yuan of national currency from the surplus of yarn and cloth in its custody as a fund to promote the increase of domestic cotton production, in order to achieve the goal of increasing domestic cotton production by 15 million dan. (2) Stipulate cotton industry loans. This year's cotton industry loans have been approved for 120 billion yuan and are now being supervised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for lending.

### Transfer and Transport of Mines and Factories in Northeast and North China to the South is Not Accurate

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] After the rumor that the mines and factories in Northeast and North China under the Resources Commission would be dismantled and transported to the south spread, it greatly affected people's hearts. According to Wei Shiliang, director of the Pingjin Office of the Commission, the rumor is not accurate, or it may be a mistake in the allocation of machinery. The south needs a large amount of coal and iron from the north, but due to inconvenient transportation, the transportation is very difficult. Therefore, there are plans to strengthen mining in stable areas in the south such as Hunan and Jiangxi, and at the same time increase the steel production in Ma'anshan and Daye. The insufficient machinery is planned to be dismantled from the wealthy parts of the Northeast for application, without the distinction between north and south. For example, more than 700 boxes of equipment from the Chongqing Radio Factory were transported to Tianjin for application. In addition, some of the hardware and equipment produced by various factories in Northeast China have recently been transported to Tianjin and Shanghai for sale.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] Sun Yueqi, deputy director of the Resources Commission, did not come to Beiping today because the "Bawang" aircraft did not arrive. Sun came to Beiping to go to the Northeast to preside over the restoration of industry and mining after the five major destructions by the communist army. Tai Shihui once telegraphed the central government, requesting to send a senior official to go quickly.

### This Year's Heavy Summer Rainfall Affects Salt Production in the North

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] Due to heavy rainfall in the summer, the output in the North has been greatly affected. In the past, the Changlu in Hebei and the Lianqu area near Qingdao in the city could produce 13 million dan of salt between April and August, but it is estimated that only 7 million dan can be produced this year, and the Yongli Factory alone needs 3 million dan of salt annually.

### Shanxi Promotes People's Economy, Prices Plummet

Shops are Scrambling to Reduce Prices

[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan, 6th] Shanxi Province is actively promoting the people's economy. Merchants, unable to obtain excessive profits, are transferring funds to Pingjin, Shanghai, Zhangjiakou, Suiyuan, Baotou, and Xi'an. The business of shops in the city is also restricted, and a frenzy of selling off goods has erupted. The streets are plastered with advertisements such as "Sacrifice Capital at Great Discount" and "Celebration Commemoration, 20% Discount", etc. After the sharp drop in prices, there is a scramble to sell off goods at reduced prices, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in the city.

### Sichuan Develops Production, Establishes Nine Factories Including Steel and Chemical

### More Than 370,000 Ounces of Gold Smuggled from the Philippines to Shanghai and Macau, Philippine Ministry of Finance Orders Customs to be Strictly Prepared

[United Press, Hong Kong, 6th] It was learned today that several aircraft recently transported 377,000 ounces of gold from Manila to Macau. Last September, the Hong Kong government banned the import of gold, and this spring it banned the transit of gold to Macau, making the area a major hub for gold imports in southern China. In Manila, after receiving this report, Philippine Finance Minister Guadeño ordered the Customs to be strictly prepared. The black market price of gold in Macau is US$51 per ounce, so the value of the smuggled gold is US$19,227,000.

### Editorial: The Seriousness of Smuggling in South China!

The Hong Kong government recently released its trade statistics for the past six months, one of which is particularly noteworthy. That is, Hong Kong exported 950 tons of tungsten ore in the past six months, while importing only 400 tons of tungsten ore in the same period. What is even more noteworthy is that during the past six months, representatives of Soviet commercial agencies in Hong Kong have been vigorously purchasing tungsten ore. Hong Kong's exports of tungsten ore to the Soviet Union included the imported tungsten ore in the same period and more, which shows that Soviet representatives in Hong Kong are sparing no effort to purchase tungsten ore. The transmission of this news makes us have to pay attention to some issues again. The first is naturally the seriousness of the smuggling problem in South China; the second is the purchasing policy of the Resources Commission; and the third is the surge in the Soviet Union's need for tungsten ore.

Tungsten is necessary for steelmaking. Although China's steelmaking industry is not developed, we are blessed with unique advantages, and our tungsten ore production accounts for more than 75% of the world's total. The border area between Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi is a world-famous tungsten ore producing area. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, tungsten ore has been controlled by the Resources Commission because it is our country's main mineral for export. In those years, when American planes came to our China one after another across the Hump, they also carried tungsten ore. Tungsten ore is one of our main commodities for earning foreign exchange. Now that the War of Resistance Against Japan has ended victoriously, we still need to earn foreign exchange because of our debts, so tungsten ore is still controlled by the Resources Commission. The statistics published by the Hong Kong government clearly show that Hong Kong imported 400 tons of tungsten ore and exported 950 tons in the past six months, so at least 550 tons of tungsten ore was imported into Hong Kong through smuggling; the number of smuggled imports that have not yet been exported is naturally even more impossible to count. Since tungsten is a mineral product of South China, it can be seen how serious smuggling in South China is.

When it comes to smuggling in South China, most people guess that unscrupulous merchants use Hong Kong to evade our tariffs and trade controls, and they mostly focus on imports. In fact, smuggling in exports has long been a big loophole, and this kind of shocking smuggling has almost existed since the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but it is only "more serious now." The relevant government authorities have not neglected the seriousness of the smuggling situation in South China. The import and export authorities have repeatedly traveled south to discuss countermeasures. However, the lure of profit is where everyone is going, and this trend cannot be stopped, and there is even a trend of intensifying. It is said that the organization is tight-knit and large-scale, and not only are unscrupulous merchants active, but also bureaucrats and soldiers are behind the scenes. Their pursuit of private gain at the expense of the country is really shocking. How to stop smuggling, fundamentally speaking, we should actively find ways to recover Hong Kong and Kowloon, so that Hong Kong no longer enjoys a special status, but this seems unlikely to be achieved in a short time. We should severely crack down on smuggling, and we should give anti-smuggling personnel preferential treatment and reward them heavily. Most importantly, corrupt officials, lawless soldiers, and unscrupulous merchants who collude with them must be severely punished without leniency. The trend of smuggling may be slightly abated.

However, there is also a major economic reason why smuggling occurs, which is that it is profitable. Taking tungsten ore alone, the price per load in the Hong Kong market is about US$100, while the price purchased by the Chinese government is said to be only one-third of the market price, that is to say, the government purchases tungsten ore at an official price equivalent to US$30, causing people engaged in tungsten ore production or operation to lose more than US$60 per load. This loss is considerable. Under these circumstances, smuggling tungsten ore has become their only way out. What we do not understand is that keeping the official purchase price too low is tantamount to encouraging smuggling. Is this the government's proper policy? Or are there some officials in the government who deliberately create this loophole? If we want to stop the smuggling of tungsten ore, then, thinking from the root, we must re-consider the official purchase price, so that those engaged in smuggling have no profit to be made, and then the trend of smuggling will stop without being suppressed.

At this point, we cannot help but think of the Soviet Union's large-scale purchases of tungsten ore, which undoubtedly shows that it is actively supplementing its steelmaking military industry, which is a symbol of its military preparedness. Since the implementation of the Soviet Union's Third Five-Year Plan, all its efforts have been concentrated on military preparations. The purchase of tungsten ore undoubtedly shows that it is actively preparing to manufacture weapons in preparation for the coming of World War III. We have control of the world's tungsten production, but we ourselves have failed to make use of this natural endowment, how can it not be heartbreaking!

### My Stance on the Indo-Dutch Dispute: Firm and Clear; Calls for Immediate End to Hostilities

Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Speaks

[Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Regarding the Indo-Dutch conflict, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after careful consideration, issued a statement on the 6th through its spokesperson, saying: The Chinese government's policy is very firm and clear. First, on the principle of politics, the Chinese government sympathizes with Indonesia's liberation and advocates that the Indo-Dutch military conflict must be terminated immediately. Based on this policy, before the outbreak of this Indo-Dutch conflict, our government had jointly sought to avoid the conflict with the British and American governments. After the conflict occurred, our representative to the Security Council immediately voted in favor of the United Nations' demand for a ceasefire, which was completely different from the position adopted by the British, French, and Belgian governments at the time. Second, our government strongly believes that the Dutch government must fulfill its legal responsibility to protect overseas Chinese, and Indonesia must stop applying the scorched-earth policy to the lives and property of overseas Chinese. China's demand is in line with international law and humanitarianism. Our government will never ignore it for any reason. This time, the Dutch side has been more diligent in rescuing distressed overseas Chinese in some areas, which is significantly better than in the past. The Indonesian side has also promised to stop the atrocities of Indonesian troops. Although the conflict has stopped, our government is still in continued negotiations regarding the safety and relief of overseas Chinese.

Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Office Suggests Four-Point Measures for Protecting Overseas Chinese

[Our Fuzhou Office, 6th] In the Dutch-Indonesian war, the lives and property of our millions of overseas Chinese are not protected. The Fujian Overseas Chinese Affairs Office recently telegraphed the central government, suggesting four measures for protecting overseas Chinese: (1) Request the UN Security Council to order both the Dutch and Indonesian sides to effectively protect the neutral nationals residing in the territory; (2) China should participate in sanctions; (3) The central government should send high-ranking officials to the Netherlands and Indonesia to console the distressed overseas Chinese and negotiate compensation for losses with the local governments; (4) Transport distressed overseas Chinese back to the country, or ask international refugee organizations to assist in dispatching ships to transport overseas Chinese, and set up factories in the country for resettlement.

Furthermore, the Fujian Provincial Assembly Committee accused the Dutch and Indonesian sides of killing our overseas Chinese and looting property during the war and telegraphed the central government to lodge a protest.

Overseas Chinese in Brebes Report on Their Suffering

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 6th] Regarding how the overseas Chinese in Brebes, twelve kilometers west of Tegal, became homeless and destitute, refugees from Tegal have prepared a report to the Chinese General Association. The report stated: On July 24, one thousand overseas Chinese in Brebes were all concentrated in the Chinese General Association. The next day, they were ordered by the Indonesian military to evacuate, walking to an undeclared area and not allowed to carry heavy objects. The report also stated that the reason for not allowing them to stay in the Chinese General Association was that the association had hoisted the national flag. The Indonesian army also tore up our national flag. It continued: On the third day, July 26, they evacuated further to a place called Bawah Gambir. Dutch and Eurasian mixed-race refugees in that area were assassinated by local terrorists. The overseas Chinese refugees were then divided into several groups, living in thatched huts. Fortunately, they still had money and were able to buy food from the locals. At 4:00 PM on the 26th, they fell into the hands of the Dutch army. On the 28th, the overseas Chinese, under the protection of the police, returned to Brebes, but their houses were either burned to ashes or looted. Therefore, they flocked to the small town of Parisdeng, with one hundred and two people crammed into small rooms that could only accommodate up to twenty-five people. The Indonesian police not only did not provide protection, but also locked the prison doors and fled. Three hours later, the Dutch army came to the rescue. The reporter visited the area on the 29th, and the tragic scene was indescribable. They have now been evacuated to Tegal, where our Chinese General Association is taking care of them.

### Japanese Man Matsumoto Impersonates Taiwanese, Sneaks into Taiwan and is Arrested for Investigation

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] On the 4th, the Taiwan Provincial Police Department arrested a Japanese man named Matsumoto in Xizhi Town, Qingshui District, Taipei County, No. 38, Xinwangli, for impersonating a Taiwanese person to sneak into Taiwan.

[Our Taipei Office, 6th] Your reporter accompanied the sixteen-member Scientific Expedition Team to New High Mountain and arrived at 5:00 PM on the 4th. Everyone embraced maximum courage to climb this only peak in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. Walking 21 kilometers from Alishan to Er Yu, they finally arrived at New High Mountain. Due to the steep and dangerous mountain road, at an altitude of 3,950 meters, facing wind, rain, and cold currents, and with low air pressure, the reporter and others felt tired limbs, dizziness, and blurred vision. They already had altitude sickness. There is only one weather station on New High Mountain, established in the 31st year of the Showa era (1956), it is the highest weather station in Southeast Asia. The six observers feel both physical and mental pain. Director Kiki Kazuo gave the expedition team the most sincere welcome. The station employs eight indigenous people to transport luggage for the group, walking very fast, far beyond the reach of ordinary people. Your reporter and others will spend three lonely but meaningful nights in the high mountains below freezing point. Researchers will use New High Mountain as the object and carry out investigations in various departments. It is even more interesting for the reporter to send telegrams from here. Shi Yanhai, Director of the Meteorological Bureau, and Bi Zhichang, Director of the Geological Survey Institute, and others, believe that the original name Wang Mountain should be restored for New High Mountain, because the Chinese people have no reason to continue to abide by the Emperor's decree. The New High Mountain is 200 meters higher than Mount Fuji. In the past, it was the highest in Japan. After the restoration, it returned to Chinese territory.

### Britain and the United States to Hold Meeting to Review the British Economic Crisis; Terms of Loan Agreement May Be Relaxed; British Government Suddenly Submits New Economic Bill to Parliament

[Our Report] London, 6th (Broadcast): British Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the United States has agreed to discuss with Britain the relaxation of the US-British loan agreement. Attlee told the House that the agreement was established at a time when the United States gradually advanced credit loans of 3.75 billion yuan, which deepened the British economic crisis. Attlee said that the loan was originally intended to be used until 1950 and will be exhausted by the end of this year. Attlee said that if we can concentrate our efforts, the result will definitely be better. We remove restrictions or go through processes. Some workers do not realize that while shortening working hours and raising wages, they must intensify their efforts in their work. However, in general, the people have done their best and a large number of construction projects have been completed. Attlee specifically emphasized "increasing production and exports," saying that at the end of last year, British overseas sales increased by one percent compared to 1938.

[Reuters, London, 6th] The Labor government yesterday suddenly submitted a new bill to Parliament, giving the North (government) extensive control over industry and labor. Opposition leader Churchill immediately convened a meeting of the opposition party after the bill was introduced to discuss countermeasures. The government's move came as a surprise, so angry opposition party members said they would force an extension of the current Parliament. However, a government spokesman has stated that the introduction of the bill is not a shortcut to socialism. It is expected that the Conservative Party leader will try to amend the bill to limit the government's powers to cope with the current economic situation. It is reported that the government's advisors strongly advocated the introduction of the bill. They believe that although the 1945 bill largely regulated the same powers, there were still some weaknesses and legal loopholes. The purpose of the previous bill was to enable the government to change the wartime economy to a peacetime economy, but whether this power can be applied to the dollar shortage crisis is still questionable. The new bill is named the Supply and Services Transitional Period Powers Bill, submitted to the Lower House by the Prime Minister himself and supported by the Cabinet's Economic Group, namely Privy Councilor Morrison, Finance Minister Dalton, Trade Minister Cripps, and Labor Minister Isaacs. The key points of the bill are: (1) The productive capacity of industry, commerce, and agriculture; (2) Promoting and guiding exports and reducing imports from various countries to balance trade; (3) Ensuring that national resources are fully utilized to serve the interests of the country.

### British Government Denies Prime Minister Will Visit the United States for Consultations

[Our Report] London, 6th (Broadcast): According to sources revealed by the government, Britain has requested the United States to discuss Britain's dollar problem as soon as possible, and it is expected that the US government will agree to this request. However, the government denied reports that Prime Minister Attlee would lead a delegation to Washington when the meeting is held.

[Reuters, London, 6th] Unofficial sources say that Prime Minister Attlee may lead Foreign Minister Bevin, Minister of Commerce Cripps, and others to Washington. President Truman has been notified of this. It is expected that it will be formally announced after the two-day economic crisis debate in the House of Commons is over. Observers believe that the purpose of this trip may be to explore the possibility of the United States providing financial assistance to Britain.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] It was learned today that regarding the US loan of 300 million US dollars to Greece to support the country's resistance to communism, the State Department has decided to assist in the construction of highways, railways, and ports as soon as possible. It has now approved the signing of contracts with many American construction engineering companies, totaling 82.4 million US dollars.

### US Diplomatic Officials Hold Meeting in Paris

Considering the New US Economic Policy Toward Europe

[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] The arrival of four senior US diplomatic officials (Douglas, Clayton, etc.) in Paris has led general observers to believe that they will discuss the economic crisis in various countries between Britain and France here on the 5th, and its impact on the shifting of countries out of production. Calling experts said: Four diplomats are carefully considering the new US economic policy toward Europe to support non-communist countries in Western Europe. Diplomatic circles said: The meeting is already discussing the crisis of the British gold pound, and the result may be to find ways to reduce the burden of British occupation expenses. At the same time, the United States wants to make France agree to immediately increase German industrial production, so the result of the ambassador's meeting may also try to adapt to France's security requirements to prevent future German aggression.

### US Suggests Mediating the Indo-Dutch Dispute; Indonesian Response Remains Cold; No Conflicts Since the Ceasefire Order Took Effect

[Reuters, Yogyakarta, 6th] Indonesian dignitaries, including Prime Minister Sjahriruddin, broadcast to Australia today, refuting Dutch claims that a ceasefire has been in effect since midnight on the 4th. Sjahriruddin said that not only has the Dutch side not stopped military activities, but it is currently expanding its military gains through aggressive actions, causing the Indonesian archipelago to fall back into a state of slavery. Although US Consul General in Batavia Mr. Smith has made suggestions to the Republic's Deputy Prime Minister regarding mediation, we welcome mediation by the disaster-stricken country, but unless UN agencies can force the Dutch to retreat to the positions before the outbreak of the conflict, we remain doubtful as to whether mediation will have good results.

You (referring to the people of Oceania) must recognize that we have been attacked. If the Security Council does not require the aggressor to withdraw from the occupied land, then the purpose of the Security Council has obviously been defeated. If the goals achieved by the Netherlands through its launched war are not sanctioned in this way, then mediation is also useless. Prior to this, Sjahriruddin addressed the Working Committee of the Republic's Parliament, stating that the Republic could not accept mediation and could only accept the arbitration of the United Nations Committee. He accused the Dutch army of occupying Gomgong, one hundred miles west of Yogyakarta, two and a half hours after the ceasefire order took effect. Indonesian Deputy President Hatta announced in Sumatra that since the Dutch side has violated the ceasefire order, the Republic can also retaliate. The Dutch military bulletin stated that the actions currently taken by the Dutch army are "protective measures" and are different from the previous "police actions," stating that the Dutch activities on Madura Island are to protect the rice-producing areas, and the actions in the area west of Surabaya in eastern Java and in Gomgong in central Java were all completed before the ceasefire order took effect. Observers here believe that neither the Indonesian nor the Dutch side has complied with the ceasefire order.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 6th] US Consul General in Batavia Mr. Smith formally handed over to Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Gani this morning the US statement expressing its willingness to mediate the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, and urged Indonesia to accept this suggestion. It is said that a mediation by one country may be more effective than mediation by a multi-country committee. Gani said that he would send it to the Yogyakarta government immediately, hoping to receive a reply tonight. The US statement also promised to send a delegation immediately once Indonesia agrees. However, Mr. Smith said that he knew nothing about the rumors that the delegation would be led by General Li Qi, former Chief of Staff of President Roosevelt.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 6th] According to the Aneta news agency, citing Yogyakarta broadcasting: Indonesia will invite the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, China, Arab countries, India, Siam, the Philippines, Australia, and Newfoundland to send observers to Indonesia to conduct on-site investigations of the situation.

### Egypt Stresses Modification of the Treaty; British Representative Rejects the Request; Requests the Security Council to Withdraw the Indictment

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 5th] British Representative Cadogan responded to Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy's request at the United Nations Security Council yesterday, denying Egypt's right to request modification of the 1936 treaty. He said that the treaty is still valid for nine years and neither party has the right to request modification before the expiration date. Therefore, since the treaty is still valid, Egypt has no reason to request the Security Council to handle it. Britain's inability to conduct treaty negotiations now is also not to blame. Therefore, he specifically requested the Security Council to withdraw the Egyptian case. At this point, the Security Council announced a recess and decided to debate again next Monday.

### Security Council Continues to Debate the Balkan Issue; Guerrillas on the Southern Border Are Active Again

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 6th] Authoritative sources said today: If the United Nations Security Council is unable to deal with the Balkan issue due to the Soviet Union's use of the veto, the United States is prepared to submit it to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. When the Security Council meets this afternoon, US Representative Johnson is expected to deliver an important speech, firmly clarifying the US position mentioned above and stating that the United States is determined to seek a solution within the United Nations mechanism, which is contrary to the rumors of extra-organizational activities.

### The US-Japan Exchange Rate is Outdated; US Merchants Advocate for Revision; Plan to Use 200 Yen per US Dollar

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] According to informal sources from the US side on the 6th, the quota system for US businessmen visiting Japan may be cancelled by the end of the year due to "no need to do so." This assumption is based on the fact that by the end of the year, there will be sufficient convenience to deal with everyone who wants to come to Japan. The issue currently being discussed in Tokyo is when an international exchange rate can be established. On the one hand, the Allied Headquarters intends to stimulate trade and knows that the exchange rate is still the biggest factor in encouraging it. On the other hand, if the value of the US dollar is set too high, although it can satisfy foreign businessmen, its impact may cause Japanese inflation to rise in a straight line and promote the collapse of the Japanese economy. US merchants intend to stipulate an exchange rate of about 200 yen per US dollar, which is four times higher than the current military exchange rate advocated by the Allied Headquarters.

### Massive Fraudulent Withdrawal from City Bank: Most Funds Recovered, Two Criminals Arrested, Fugitive Chen Zhihe Allegedly Purchased Airplane Ticket to Qingdao

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the incident of fraudulent withdrawal of a large sum of money from a certain bank using a forged seal, which was exposed by this newspaper yesterday, the following is an account of the police's investigation: The bank in question is the Shanghai City Bank. The incident occurred at 9:00 AM on the 26th of last month, when the bank opened for business. Two well-dressed young men, speaking with a Hangzhou accent, presented an immediate check from the Police Security Headquarters for 176 million yuan, along with three sacks to store the legal tender after receiving the payment. After the bank clerk verified the seal and registered the transaction, the full amount was paid. In a show of special consideration, the teller paid 90 million yuan in large ten-thousand-yuan notes. After receiving the money, one of the young men asked the teller to borrow the telephone, and it was learned from the phone call that they were contacting the Gu National Car Company to dispatch a car. Shortly thereafter, the car arrived, and the two men calmly carried the three sacks full of legal tender into the car and left. At 4:40 PM that day, the City Bank discovered that the Police Security Headquarters had overdrawn a large amount and inquired by telephone. The Headquarters denied the matter and stated that there had been no overdraft. When the bank re-examined the huge check and carefully verified the seal, it was discovered that the seal was forged. The bank immediately reported the information to the Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Bureau, requesting investigation and pursuit. Under the direction of Section Chief Li, officers Ma Fei Mu and Sun Zhen Ying investigated and arrested the key suspect Qin Zheng Ming (26 years old, from Hangzhou, currently employed by the Police Security Headquarters) that evening in western Shanghai. After interrogation, Qin confessed that there were a total of three accomplices in the case, including Chen Zhihe (26 years old, from Hangzhou, a dismissed police officer) and Yang Yu Shan (23 years old, from Hangzhou). Qin had previously taken advantage of his position to steal a blank check from the City Bank. After discussing it with Chen and Yang, they decided to forge the three seals originally used by the Headquarters and issued a check for 176 million yuan dated the 26th. Chen and Yang went to withdraw the money. Qin was deeply afraid of being discovered by the bank, so he only accompanied them to the entrance of the City Bank and then went to a friend's house in western Shanghai until he was arrested. Therefore, he did not know anything about what happened after the withdrawal, he said.

Driven to the Weida Hotel: Plan to Dismiss the Driver

The police officers in charge planned to investigate again the next day, but because of the sudden case involving the "Golden Metropolis" conscript, the entire Criminal Investigation Division was ordered to investigate the truth, and the investigation had to be temporarily suspended. Soon after, Section Chief E ordered Ma Fei Mu to continue the investigation, and it was learned that after the two men got into the car with the money that day, they had ordered the driver to drive to the Weida Hotel. When they got out of the car, they asked him to help carry a sack to room 107. After paying the fare, they ordered him to drive to Jiangwan to pick up a Mr. Li, saying, "Everyone knows Mr. Li in Jiangwan Town, go quickly and come back quickly." When the driver returned empty-handed from Jiangwan and intended to report back to them, the two men had already settled their room bill and disappeared. Later, after the police inquired at the Weida Hotel, they learned that after the driver left, the two men bought three suitcases nearby, stored the money in them, and ordered the tea boy to settle the room bill, hiring two rickshaws to escape to the west.

Investigating a Strange Letter in Hangzhou, Leading to the Retrieval of Stolen Money in Shanghai

At this point, the police officers had no choice but to investigate the families of the two criminals and learned of Yang Yu Shan's Hangzhou address (22 Huixing Road). On the 31st, Ma and another officer, Wu Zuzhi, disguised themselves and went to Yang's home, where they found a strange letter sent from 16 Changsheng Lane, Changning Road, Shanghai, with many clues related to the case. They immediately telegraphed Section Chief E to report, and sent officers Chen Guangrong, Han Yongchang, and Sun Zhenying to the address, where they found two suitcases containing 104 million yuan in legal tender. They then waited at the location until late at night and arrested Yang Wangshan. According to Yang's confession, the two men had used the aliases Wang Qin and Zhou Guoming, and booked rooms 301 and 302 at the Xiang Sheng Hotel. When they rushed to the Xiang Sheng Hotel, Chen had already fled upon hearing the news. However, Chen had entrusted the Xiang Sheng Hotel to deposit 30 million yuan in legal tender, which has been seized by the police. Chen originally planned to go to Qingdao as a "safe haven" with the money, and Chen had already purchased a plane ticket from China National Aviation Corporation to Qingdao for the 1st of this month. At the Xiang Sheng Hotel, the police also seized two Western suits and three official seals belonging to the two criminals. In total, the recovered stolen money amounted to 155 million yuan, with 21 million yuan still missing. Currently, the police are continuing to pursue Chen Zhihe, and the two arrested criminals have been handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

Later, Liu Gulin shouted 'robber.' What I had in my hand was all fines, and I did not rob anyone." Liu Gulin claimed: "Zhu and Chen asked me for more than one million, saying it was for expenses.

The defendant's defense lawyer stood up and stated: "The defendant Zhu Kai has been detained for several months, and this case has been delayed and has not been concluded.

During the tea party, Speaker Pan delivered a speech expressing his welcome and said: China is an ancient country with culture, and there is more than one religion and ethnic group in the country. However, over thousands of years of cultivation, the compatriots of all ethnic groups and religions have united together to form a great Republic of China.

Worthy of Our Permanent Remembrance

Since Islam was introduced to China from Arabia, the number of believers in our country, regardless of ethnicity, has been increasing day by day. In terms of region, this is the case in the northwestern provinces and border areas, and the Yangtze River, Pearl River, and Yellow River basins are also the same. There are mosques and co-religionists everywhere, which proves that co-religionist culture has also constituted a part of Chinese culture and cannot be separated from Chinese culture. Some people believe that cultural communication is an essential element of national unity, and we must strive to work in the area of cultural communication in order to achieve the strong party of the unity of the five ethnic groups. Today, pilgrims from Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other provinces and border areas come to Shanghai, which is the first time since the victory. Especially since the purpose of this trip is to go to the holy land of Islam for pilgrimage, and the journey has traversed Chinese territory and major cities such as the capital Shanghai, it is of great help in communicating culture. Therefore, the significance of this trip is very profound and worthy of our permanent remembrance.

Made Great Contributions to the Country

Looking back on Chinese history, especially during the Sui and Tang dynasties, in the golden age of Emperor Taizong of Tang, and during the revitalization of Guo Ziyi, many famous figures in politics and military affairs were all Islamic believers, or Muslims and Turks, and made great contributions to the country. In other words, the compatriots in the border provinces and border areas have made great achievements for the country in the past, and it is believed that they will definitely continue to make greater contributions to the country in the future, just as the deeds shown in history. The Doctrine of the Mean says; "All things grow together without harming one another, and ways run parallel without conflicting with one another," which is the highest expression of the Chinese spirit, and we are willing to encourage each other with this. Speaking of Shanghai, the Council is an organ of public opinion. Although the senators have different ancestral homes and religious beliefs, they can all cooperate to build the city. We hope that all Muslim compatriots will also be like this, and work together to build the country.

Mayor Holds Tea Party Reception

After Speaker Pan finished his speech, the head of the delegation, Mr. Ai, delivered a speech in the Hui language to express his gratitude, and said: Muslims from various countries will participate in the pilgrimage to Mecca, and they will take the opportunity to promote our country's strong national power, advanced political facilities, and entry into the path of democratic politics. The speeches of Mr. Pan and Mr. Ai were translated by Ma Yunwen and Tu Le'gan respectively. The tea party ended at noon. The delegation went to the City Party Department to visit Director Fang, and Secretary Xie received them on behalf of Director Fang. Mayor Wu held a tea party at the City Hall in the afternoon. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai by boat the day after tomorrow.

Unexpectedly, he had a severe reaction, his limbs became cold, and he died at 9:20 AM the next morning at the Sino-American Hospital.

### Five Injured in Child Snatching and Torture

After investigation, it was learned that Lin Miaoying had previously been intimate with Yan Jinpei, but Yan had fled after being arrested for opium in the past, leaving Lin without food or clothing. Therefore, she was introduced by Ji Xiaogou, a friend of her cousin Shi Xiaoyuan, and became intimate with Zhao Guijiang, a local.

### Hefei Native Accuses Fellow Villager of Kidnapping, Rape, and Extortion: Yuan Zhize Detained Pending Investigation

According to the complaint, Yuan Zhize, a bandit from their hometown, broke into Yuan's residence in the middle of the night in April of last year with a group of armed men and kidnapped the woman Aying. They hid her in the bandit's lair and repeatedly raped her for five months. Aying, unable to endure the abuse, escaped from the bandit's lair last October and came to Shanghai, where she resided with Liu Mengku. Unexpectedly, Yuan Zhize tracked her down to Shanghai and locked her up in Liu Mengku's house, threatening her in every way to take Aying away and extort a large sum of money. In addition to the 200,000 yuan that Liu Mengku had already been extorted, he still demanded 50 million yuan. If it was not handed over, he would kill her.

### Restoration of Cultivation in Yongcheng Dike, Yueyang: The Dawn of Agricultural Mechanization Revolution in Hunan

[Report from our newspaper in Changsha] Hunan used to be the granary of China, and there was a saying among the people that "If Hunan and Guangdong are rich, the world will be full." However, our country's agriculture is still stuck in primitive times, relying purely on favorable weather. If the weather is unfavorable, regardless of floods, droughts, insect plagues, or other disasters, farmers are powerless to resist. After the war, in addition to a desolate wilderness, the rural areas were destroyed, and everything needed for cultivation, such as manpower, animal power, farm tools, seeds, fertilizers, ponds, and dams, was lost. Since its establishment in the winter of 1945, the Hunan Branch has made every effort to restore cultivation in rural areas, distributing farm tools, rice seeds, vegetable seeds, fertilizers, loans, purchasing cattle, and subsidizing pest control, striving for timely restoration of cultivation in rural areas. Last year, they were able to barely overcome the disaster. This year, a bumper harvest is expected. However, this type of distribution work is ultimately a temporary solution. It is feared that it will be difficult to continue after the Hunan Branch ends. It is necessary to innovate our country's agriculture and develop new agriculture, which is a long-term solution.

The Hunan Branch takes the Yueyang Tractor Restoration Training Area as a demonstration of a mechanized farm in this regard. It has requested the headquarters to allocate 40 tractors, and 20 have already arrived. Fifty students have been recruited to train to restore cultivation in Yongcheng Dike. Yongcheng Dike has an area of ​​60,000 mu, and 30,000 mu are currently wasteland. The reeds are seven or eight feet high, and birds and beasts hide among them. After all the land is restored to cultivation, it can accommodate 15,000 households. If each household is calculated with five people, then 75,000 households will rely on this for their livelihood. The experiment of Yongcheng Dike's work has made farmers deeply interested and created belief, indicating that farmers are not too conservative. As long as there is perseverance to do it, it can still be reformed. Yongcheng Dike is just the beginning of new agriculture, and the innovation of the entire Hunan agriculture has a long way to go. The new businesses that the Hunan Branch has established in rural areas also include the pond-digging machine training class. Seven technicians have been trained and 20 ponds have been dug in Hengyang, with excellent results. Now, for the work in Yongcheng Dike in Yueyang, 41 water pumps have been allocated. The Hunan Branch has organized a water conservancy irrigation team to work in the counties that need it in July and August.

Another serious problem in the rural areas is livestock plague. For a farming household, a plow ox is the greatest asset. Losing a cow is more painful than losing a son. The Hunan Branch has organized a livestock treatment team to give farmers free injections to their plow oxen in various counties. At first, they hesitated, but after seeing that they did not suffer from the plague and were guaranteed to never suffer from the plague, they all rushed to request injections. The team was originally preventing cattle plague in Guanyang, but now it has been divided into two teams to prevent pig plague in Changsha, Ningxiang, and Liuyang.

According to the branch's statistics, the branch's agricultural relief work includes the following items: (1) distribution of seeds and fertilizers, (2) handling loans for plow oxen, (3) distribution of farm tools, (4) prevention and treatment of animal epidemics, and (5) restoration of Yongcheng Dike and management of tractor training areas. Yongcheng Dike is a mechanized demonstration farm. After 60,000 mu of wasteland is cultivated, it can accommodate 15,000 farm households to divide and cultivate.

As for industrial relief work, it includes the following items: (1) industrial and commercial loans, (2) lending small-scale industrial loans, (3) issuing small-scale business loans, (4) assisting various industrial manufacturers in applying for equipment, and (5) allocating and selling industrial equipment. As for the medical institutions subsidized by the Hunan Branch in Hunan Province, there are a total of 123 units.

For the urgent relief this year, the Hunan Branch entrusted the International Relief Committee to handle it, and the Hunan Branch and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) are jointly responsible for supervision. In fact, the food supply this year is unsustainable. It only carries out emergency relief in the 14 counties and cities with the most serious disasters, including Hengshan, Xiangxiang, Chaling, Anren, Hengyang, (city and county), Leiyang, Chen County, Changning, Qiyang, Shaoyang, Lingling, Dong'an, and Dao County. For the remaining 17 counties that reported disasters, only personnel were sent to investigate and report. In addition to the 5,000 tons of rice and flour and 5,000 tons of canned food allocated by the Hunan Branch, the Hunan Provincial Government distributed 5,000 tons of rice from the county and city granaries, for a total of 15,000 tons. At present, the number of disaster victims awaiting relief in each city and county is estimated at 20% of the number of disaster victims in July of last year, as the number of people to be relieved this year. Each person receives half a catty of food per day. (February, Ping)

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau Rushing to Complete the Work: Laying Track in Five Sections

Now that the police and security have been merged, the two ministries of National Defense and Interior Affairs have ordered the retention of the Security Commander. It is heard that other provinces will do the same. As for how to retain the Security Command, clarification is still needed.

[Report from our newspaper in Kaifeng] Countless passengers were burned to death in the Mangshan Tunnel on the Pinghan Railway the other day. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. According to a gentleman who was on the same train to Bian at the time: The smoke emitted from the locomotive chimney was black during the day and red at night. The weather that day was unusually hot. When the train traveled into the Mangshan Tunnel (which is about several miles long), the passengers sitting on top of the first two cars closest to the locomotive were the first to be hit by the smoke and fire emitted from the chimney. As a result, the passengers on top of the car cried out loudly due to the fierce fire, to no avail. Therefore, there was chaos with screams and wails. Some risked jumping off the train (jumping off the train in the tunnel was even more difficult to escape), some were burned to death with their hands holding their heads, and some women rolled under the car while holding their children. After the train arrived at Nan'an Station and stopped, it was found that there were 15 corpses on top of the car, all with their hands holding their heads, shaped like foot-long little monkeys, black and charred all over, and it was impossible to tell their gender.

The exact number of people who fell off the car and died in the tunnel is still impossible to count. (3rd)

Yingda University to Build Temporary School Buildings; Relocation of the School is Temporarily Shelved; Construction of Permanent School Buildings Requires 40 Billion

[Our Jinhua Special Dispatch] The relocation of the Yingda University campus is now temporarily shelved. In order to meet the needs of expanding departments next year, the school authorities plan to find a suitable environment in Jinhua. In addition to continuing to lease some of the existing school buildings, such as the Fifth Prison, the Dacheng Hall, the Pagoda Temple, and the Zhang Family Ancestral Hall for a short period of time, the school affairs meeting has approved the construction of some temporary school buildings, including six large classrooms, one material testing room, one power plant, and one storage room. In addition, the county-run Jian Teachers' School will be borrowed and renovated into the school buildings for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The project is expected to start in mid-month.

In addition, the drawings of the permanent campus of Yingda University were drafted by the German engineer Paulick during the tenure of President Yang Gongda. The drawings include four colleges of Arts and Sciences, Law, Agriculture, and Engineering (the Medical College was not included at that time), as well as the Yingshi Memorial Hall, sports field, faculty dormitory, student dormitory, gymnasium... and dozens of other buildings, covering an area of more than a thousand acres. The estimated cost at that time was more than 20 billion, but due to the continued rise in prices, it was revised to 35.7 billion. According to the calculations of the professors of the College of Engineering, it is now impossible to start without more than 40 billion. The ideal base at that time was the Jinhua Lake Seawall, but after surveying, it was found that the soil was loose and could not be used. Although the principle of relocating from Jinhua has been decided, the school authorities still believe that this drawing is quite satisfactory, and it will inevitably be carried out according to this plan after the relocation is successful. The school now has only about 4 billion left for construction. It is said that if construction starts, friends of Mr. Yingshi during his lifetime are willing to help, so this plan still has hope of being realized.

In addition to Huayan Women's Team winning the championship, the B group matches are also more than halfway through, and there is still one supplementary match in the A group. The organizers decided to hold it today, with Yongsha Hong playing against Huayan. Yongsha Hong had been defeated by Huayan in that match. Today, the two teams meet for the second time, and Yongsha Hong will do its best to avenge the previous defeat. Huayan is a victorious army, but in the second cycle, it was unfortunately defeated by the Soviet Union army, forming a confrontational situation with the Soviet Union. If Huayan can overcome Yongsha today, it will have to compete with the Soviet Union again. If it loses to Yongsha, the championship will be won by the Soviet Union.

Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament; Central Defeats Jiaotong; Today Zhejiang Xing vs. Jiaotong

The seventh act of the first Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Six-Team Finals was held at the China Ball Room at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, with Central playing against Jiaotong, judged by Jiang Xiaoshi. Central was originally the seed of the Yin Group and the champion of that group. Because they lost to Zhejiang Xing in their first match, their hopes of winning the championship were greatly reduced. They dared not be careless in yesterday's match against the mediocre Jiaotong, so they were able to lead all the way. Jiaotong's talents are weaker and lack experience. Although they were able to tie six points, they eventually lost to 13.

Starting at 7:00 PM today, the ninth act of the finals will still be held at the China Ball Room, with Zhejiang Xing playing against Jiaotong, judged by Chen Qianhao. Zhejiang Xing is the runner-up of the Qian Group. Since winning the first battle against Central, their momentum is strong. Jiaotong is a defeated general of Central, so it is difficult to resist Zhejiang Xing. The results of the day before yesterday are recorded as follows:

(Central) Won Lost Xu Chuanming 4 0 Peng Wangwei 3 1 Hu Kaiming 3 0 Ruan Zhixiong 2 2 Yu Shuren 1 3

(Jiaotong) Won Lost Wang Xinyi 3 1 Xu Yeming 2 2 He Peizhi 1 2 Wang Naicui 0 4 Lu Jinglu 0 4

Chen States Opinions on Opening Trade with Japan; Shanghai Industrial Representatives Go to the Capital Yesterday; Urges Temporary Suspension of Petition to Determine Raw Material Allocation Rights

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai industrial community, due to the government's decision to open trade with Japan, sent representatives Hu Baixiang, Mao Shengdong, Tian Heqing, Cheng Shouchong, Liu Qingyi, and more than ten others to the capital by special train at 11:00 PM last night to state four points of opinion to the authorities: (1) The raw materials and machinery imported should be limited to those allowed to be imported under the "Provisional Measures for the Amendment of Import and Export Trade." (2) The representatives of the business investigation group must be carefully selected and their powers determined to eliminate private profiteering. (3) Strictly prevent smuggling and strengthen the anti-smuggling mechanism, with the assistance of industrial and commercial groups. (4) Assist domestic goods factories to improve production in order to compete with foreign goods.

In addition, in order to appeal for the allocation rights of industrial raw materials, the Industrial Association and the Industrial Federation originally planned to petition to the capital at the same time. However, yesterday, Director Zhang Jia'ao of the Transportation Control Committee asked Luo Qinghua of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to suspend the trip to the capital and negotiate further. After discussions among the representatives, it was decided to postpone the trip to the capital for three days. During these three days, they will contact Director Zhang first. If there are no results, they will go to the capital.

Buyers Watch and Wait, Outport Merchants Remain Inactive; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline Across the Board; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Continues to Fall by 200,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was relatively quiet. Merchants from Tianjin and Guangdong remained slack. Although weaving factories added a little, the market remained sluggish. As a result, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix Yarn was 16.7 million yuan, continuing to fall by 200,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix also fell by 200,000 yuan, to 14.8 million yuan. 20-count Special Double Horse was 12.1 million, down 200,000 yuan. Light Double Horse fell 100,000 yuan, to 10.3 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn such as 16-count Guangming Red Bee Hailong, and 10-count and 32-count, also decreased by varying amounts of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially opened with reports that a large quantity of Japanese yarn and cloth was being shipped from Shanghai to Southeast Asia, and that the cotton harvest in various places was quite good, with the new cotton season approaching, which would reduce the cost of yarn and cloth. Buyers in the market adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and outport sales were also inactive. Only local merchants had sporadic interest, and holders were unwilling to sell cheaply due to cost concerns, resulting in a stalemate. However, near the close, scattered sellers dumped their goods, and price cuts were frequent, with a chorus of selling in the market, and prices plummeted. As a result, 12-pound Longtou Fine Cloth fell to 423,000 yuan, continuing to fall by 3,000 yuan from the previous day. Various fine cloths such as Fufu Blue Chicken Rainbow Ball Yanghe also continued to decline by 1,000 to 15,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, colored cloth, and blue cloth also fell by varying amounts of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan to 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

Fangjian Sells Yarn

Also, China Fangjian Company opened yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 168 pieces of various counts, and manufacturers submitted 69 purchase orders. Due to the sluggish yarn market, the company's list price was 200,000 yuan lower for 6-count Sunlight Coarse Yarn than the previous period, at 5.7 million yuan. 32-count Three-Strand Eight Horse Yarn was 700,000 yuan lower, at 13.8 million yuan. 32-count Xiantao Cone Yarn was 12.8 million yuan, down 200,000 yuan from the negotiated price. 40-count Sunlight Cone Yarn was 100,000 yuan lower, at 14.5 million yuan. 42-count Chestnut was 300,000 yuan lower, listed at 14.7 million yuan. 60-count Sunlight Cone Yarn was 300,000 yuan lower, at 20.2 million yuan. 60-count Double-Strand Chestnut was 500,000 yuan lower, at 21.1 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn were similar to the previous period.

Also, private factories opened yarn. Yongsha opened about 200 pieces of various counts of Jincheng brand yarn a few days ago, and Siyi opened about 100 pieces of various counts of Jinji brand yarn. Yesterday, Anda opened nearly 100 pieces of 32-count Flying Tiger brand, and Shenxin opened dozens of pieces of Hongren Bell, all sold at negotiated prices. However, due to the market decline yesterday, some yarn numbers were no longer profitable after being purchased.

Spot Cotton Market Improves

Yesterday, the spot cotton market improved. Although yarn and cloth fell, yarn factories were still keen to purchase, but due to price limits, transactions mostly stalled halfway. Holders believe that it will take two months for new cotton to enter the market, and they are unwilling to sell at a discount during this lean period, so transactions were not active. The asking prices for delivery to factories were 2.2 million yuan and 2.23 million yuan. The warehouse prices were 2.11 million yuan, 2.115 million yuan, 2.12 million yuan, and 1.13 million yuan. Zhengzhou Fine Velvet was 2.2 million yuan, Han Fine was 2.12 million yuan, Nantai Cang was 1.76 million yuan, and Zhoupu Seed Cotton was 320,000 yuan per bundle.

Also, China Fangjian Company traded a batch of domestic cotton with cotton merchants in the city yesterday, totaling more than 3,200 bales. The transaction prices were 2.15 million yuan for Jingyang Cotton, 2.14 million yuan for Lingbao Cotton, 1.98 million yuan for Hankou Fine Velvet, and 2.05 million yuan for Shashi Cotton.

American Cotton Arrives in Shanghai

Also, the Shunheng Company's Steaming Vessel Lin Fan'er arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday, carrying more than 6,010 pieces of cotton, more than 540 bundles of steel plates and iron wires, more than 8,000 barrels of gasoline, diesel oil, and kerosene, more than 800 barrels of lubricating oil, and more than 1,100 bags of ink ash. Also, the Lai Company's Washington Liner arrived from the United States carrying 230,000 feet of lumber, 20 boxes of gold diamonds, and 73 pieces of machinery, which are equipment for factory bureaus to mine. Also, 29 tons of ink, 5 cars, 1 ambulance, totaling more than 800 tons.

Purchasing Foreign Cotton

[Another Report] Regarding foreign cotton that has not obtained an import license, the Central Trust Bureau has long been ordered to purchase it. It is learned that importers holding this foreign cotton have requested the Central Trust Bureau to exchange cotton for yarn to compensate for their foreign exchange losses. The Central Trust Bureau has specially appointed Zhang Xu, deputy manager of the Bureau's Purchasing Department, to go to the capital to attend the meeting of the Four Joint Offices to make a final decision.

Central Trust Bureau Issues Statement on Distribution of Rayon; Representatives of the Silk Weaving Industry Petition the Municipal Government

[Our Dispatch] A person in charge of the Central Trust Bureau issued a statement yesterday regarding the Bureau's distribution of rayon:

(1) Distribution Method: This is still what the personnel in charge of the Bureau have been fighting for. The Bureau has always adopted auction or bidding methods for the sale of various government materials. The fact that the Bureau is still maintaining the distribution method for rayon means that the original distributors have already been given the right of priority distribution. If there is still dissatisfaction with this distribution method, the Bureau will be forced to change to auction or bidding methods for sale.

(2) Price Issue: When the Bureau started distributing rayon last year, the distribution price was originally adjusted dynamically according to the market. The fact that the distribution price had once remained unchanged for a period of time was due to the time-consuming process of requesting the Executive Yuan to adjust the silk price. After the Executive Yuan approved the Bureau to handle it at its discretion, the adjustment began. The adjustment method is that the personnel in charge of the Bureau consult and set the distribution price for the following week based on the average market price of rayon for one week, and with reference to the market price on the last day of one week, and then reducing it by 10 percent.

(3) The Silk Weaving Factories Claim: If the silk is woven at the current distribution price, the factories will be forced to shut down due to rising costs. In fact, in the previous months, the Bureau's rayon distribution was once interrupted due to a shortage of rayon, and no silk weaving factories were heard to have shut down. The claim that the distribution of silk will cause shutdowns is self-defeating. As for the silk weaving factories' claim that the payment for the Bureau's distribution of goods must be paid one week in advance, if there is any inconvenience, they can propose improvements and the Bureau will be happy to consider accepting them.

Also, representatives of the silk weaving industry went to the Municipal Government yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu to petition. Yesterday afternoon, a small group meeting was held in the industry association to submit a document to the Municipal Government stating the current difficulties of the manufacturers, requesting a reasonable reduction in the distribution price to facilitate production. If necessary, they will go to Nanjing to petition, and it was decided that from today onwards, all factories will automatically stop buying rayon on the black market. If the original silk cannot be sold, they would rather be forced to stop work completely.

Slight Fluctuations in Rayon Market Price

Also, the Central Trust Bureau's distribution list for rayon has been sent to the Silk Weaving Industry Association, but because the issue of requesting a reduction in the distribution price has not been resolved, the payment has not been made. The market price fluctuated slightly yesterday. The price of 120-count Gaoshan and Asahi, etc., with gloss, was 25 million yuan in the morning and 25.2 million yuan in the afternoon, 200,000 yuan less than the previous day.

Factory operators said that the actual sales were very light, and yesterday the market price was slightly tired. Grade C was asking for 29.2 million yuan, but there were few takers. Gao Zero Lot had a slight transaction, priced at 28.5 million yuan. 28-count Dry Warp had orders asking for 18 million. Net Goods were also tired. Huatong Bedspread opened at 10.456 million yuan, and the closing price was 480,000 yuan. Dacheng Bedspread closed at 10.478 million yuan, and the closing price was 500,000 yuan for the spot price. Checked crepe was asking for 34,000 yuan, and there were buyers, but there were no transactions.

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau Discusses Reducing the Distribution Price

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau went to the private residence of President Zhang of the National Bank the night before last to discuss the rayon matter. President Zhang agreed to find a way. Yesterday morning, Bureau Director Wu Rencang of the Central Trust Bureau exchanged opinions with Wu again. Wu hoped that the Central Trust Bureau could understand the difficulties of the merchants and reduce the distribution price, according to the previous percentage increase, limited to 50% of the previous distribution price of 9.6 million per box. Wu Rencang asked the Social Affairs Bureau to forward the document submitted by the silk weaving industry to the Central Trust Bureau for further consultation and decision.

According to Wu Kaixian's statement to reporters: The silk weaving industry itself is in a recession. If the government wants to maintain it, it should find a way to reduce costs. This is not only related to commodity prices, but also to the survival of silk weaving factories. The rayon of the Central Trust Bureau is shipped from Japan and is a sole business. The cost per box is 190 US dollars. If you add freight, tariffs, and insurance, and settle in the black market, the cost is only 4.5 million per box. If you settle at the official price of 12,000, it is even cheaper. The current distribution price per box is 23.6 million, which is too high. The Social Affairs Bureau cannot ignore the suffering of the industrial and commercial sectors, so it hopes that the Central Trust Bureau can reduce the distribution price to not exceed 50% of the increase in the previous distribution price. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the reasons given by the silk weaving industry are reasonable, and can prove to the Central Trust Bureau that the silk weaving industry is currently in a dire situation due to high costs and difficult production and sales. The current problem for each factory is not how much money to make, but whether to survive.

Frequent Pressure from the Short Side; Lackluster Trading in Shanghai Stocks

Shanghai stocks were rampant with short selling yesterday due to the roll-over effect. Yongsha stabilized and then succumbed, trading decreased, and the market was bleak. Small stocks were relatively stable. Qinxing was unwilling to succumb and suddenly made a comeback. The price was forced to the limit in the middle of the session, and the market sentiment was slightly affected. The process was the most stable at this time. However, new buying was insufficient, and the market was finally overwhelmed by the short side at the close. Xinhe's last day of trading was lower than the current trading price, forming an inversion.

The opening was mixed. Yongsha opened at 239 yuan, and was sold at 232, 234, 238.5, and 232.07. The market side also sold, falling to 222 yuan. After 222.04 was sold, it suddenly advanced. 222.18 also accepted the current Yongsha. 222.23 and 221.67 also advanced, once rising to 228 yuan. 222.76, 222.65, 222.84, 222.83, and 222.60 continued to sell, and 222.50 and 222.23 also sold the current Yongsha, retreating to around 224 yuan and struggling. The situation was very mediocre.

After 10:30, Qinxing suddenly emerged. 193 and 188 strongly bought, repeatedly forcing the price to the 80.4 yuan limit. As a result, the retail investors were slightly agitated. Yongsha was accepted at the current price by 104, and 116 and 218 advanced to deliver. At the same time, 36 also worked hard to cover the current Yongsha, and once rose back to 228 yuan. 14, 224, 232, 235, and 78 took the opportunity to sell, and the price remained subdued.

After 11:30, 224 and 163 strongly sold the current Yongsha, forcing the price down to the low price of 219 yuan for both roll-over. As a result, Xinguang's current and roll-over were inverted, and so was Xinhe. Because Xinhe's roll-over trading was done until that day, 14 and 23 took the opportunity to buy the current Yongsha cheaply, and 157 and 24 covered the roll-over, and the noon close was at 230 yuan and 222 yuan.

After the close, 190's fierce supply made the last asking price for roll-over Yongsha as low as 220 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, the current shares were Yongsha, Meiya, and Hua, Xinguang and Yonggong fell slightly, Zhongfa and Jingfu rose slightly, Xinhua rose by 50% strongly, Qinxing rose by 50%, and Xinhe fell by 50% strongly. Zhongfang Innerwear was flat, Datong, Zhongs, Rongfeng, Matches, and Cement fell slightly, Tongyi fell, and Jinglun rose by 50% weakly. The roll-over shares were Yongsha, Meiya, Xinguang, and Jingfu fell slightly, and Huafeng and Xinhe fell by about 50%. The old shares outside the market were quite peaceful.

Jointly Operated Factories Actively Promote Expansion of Southeast Asian Market; Working Day and Night to Produce Exported Cotton Textiles

According to the person in charge of China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Marketing Joint Operation Company: Regarding the issue of raw material supply for the promotion of finished products in Southeast Asia, the person in charge of the company has reached a settlement with China Fangjian Company, and it can be allocated continuously in the short term, which is deeply gratifying. However, there is only one week left before the opening of Japan, and if the planned export products cannot be shipped as scheduled, domestic cotton textiles will inevitably lag behind the arrival of Japanese goods in Southeast Asia. The advantages and disadvantages of this are self-evident. The various factories under the company are purely private industries. They started to establish a joint operation mechanism under the stimulus of the opening of Japan's foreign trade, which is a sign that China's industry has begun to unite. Although the allocation of raw materials and funds to the various manufacturers participating in the company is relatively late, they are working day and night to rush production, so that a part of it can be exported before the 15th of this month.

### Illegal Tax Collection: Fan Xinwei Arrested

[Reported by our Suzhou office on the 6th] Fan Xinwei, the head of the Huqiu branch of the Suzhou Tax Bureau, was today transferred to the District Procuratorate by the county government for illegally collecting taxes. The court immediately opened the trial, which lasted three hours, and ordered his detention.

[Another Dispatch] The Suzhou Grain Bureau, with the collection of actual grain about to begin this year, is devising methods to reform the malpractice of tax evasion as soon as possible. A sound plan has been drafted and will be implemented as soon as it is approved.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding special criminal cases such as banditry and opium, which were previously subject to military law under the Emergency Measures for Pacification Zones, the Ministry of Justice recently presented to the Executive Yuan for approval that cases of banditry and opium outside war zones be transferred to judicial trial. However, military legal institutions at all levels have not yet received orders to transfer jurisdiction, making the transfer difficult. The extent of their authority is therefore crucial to the severity of sentencing, which is of great concern to society. Our reporter specifically visited the Suzhou High Court to inquire. According to reports, in order to seek coordination between the two sides, the Suzhou judicial community does not intend to demand immediate transfer based on the ministerial order. However, if the parties voluntarily submit to judicial trial and apply for retrial, they will decide to apply for retrial to the military authorities at any time in accordance with the Retrial Law, as a compromise.

### Guangdong-Guangxi Border: Thousands of Seeds of Malignant Tumors, Zhang Zai's Wife Leads Bandits in Raiding Homes

[Reported from our Wuzhou office] From Luchuan and Bobai counties in Guangxi to Lingshan, Qin County, Fangcheng, Lianjiang, and Hepu in Guangdong, and extending to the Leizhou area, the people of Guangdong and Guangxi collectively call it "Nanlu" (Southern Road). In the past, the treacherous bandits of Nanlu hid in the mountain forests along the border between Guangdong and Guangxi, learning in Guangdong and fleeing north into Guangxi, or being suppressed in Guangxi and fleeing south into Guangdong. Further west were the tri-border areas of Guangxi-Vietnam and Guangdong-Vietnam, which were easily exploited by criminals. Furthermore, a group of "lobbyists" with organizational skills became guests of honor, attracting and gathering people, thus forming a semi-political, semi-savage force. Add to this some young students who are "ahead of the curve" adding fuel to the fire. Under these "favorable conditions", the Guangdong-Guangxi border began to rapidly conceal thousands of seeds of malignant tumors, causing turmoil and plunging the people into misery, eventually attracting the deep attention of the government.

Large quantities of new weapons were distributed

Under suppression, bandits often quickly dispersed and went to ground, appearing to be law-abiding and minding their own business. Government troops cannot randomly kill one or two of them without evidence, and so they are released. The local militia is still weak. Whether in Guangdong or Guangxi, when bandits come with great momentum, they are often intimidated by the bandit forces and dare not attack, which contributes to local disasters. Having learned this lesson, the authorities have decided to strengthen local military equipment. Recently, a batch of new light and heavy weapons has been distributed, including submachine guns, rocket launchers, light and heavy machine guns, and large quantities of ammunition. If we say that using such troops and weapons to deal with some insignificant petty bandits, it can only be said that the political significance far outweighs the military significance. The situation seems to be moving towards superficial stability due to the increase in military force. Heavy troops are stationed on the Guangdong-Guangxi border - from Luchuan to Panlong and Shijiao, where a large number of security forces are stationed. The situation in Guangxi has been relatively calm for several months. Although bandits in Guangdong are still rampant in rural areas, their rampant momentum has slightly subsided recently. In order to seek a permanent solution, local officials have convened emergency security meetings, gathering local gentry and grassroots cadres from the entire region and county to discuss fundamental solutions. They all believe that only a political solution can eradicate the root of the problem. Therefore, General Lin Ying also gave instructions, on the one hand to save the fallen villages and quickly restore them, and on the other hand to severely punish derelict cadres. At the same time, he mobilized student organizations to form large-scale propaganda teams to go to the countryside to promote the policy of conversion. Recently, anti-bandit propaganda rallies have been held successively in various places.

Female bandit leads her troops to occupy the mountains

Just as there are male "bandits", there are also female "bandits." In the Lingshan area west of Guinan, Zheng Kunyi, the wife of Zhang Yan—a famous general of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War who was executed in Yulin, Guangxi in 1944 for "delaying military opportunities"—led more than 2,000 of her former troops to occupy the mountains, raiding homes and "liberating" the pockets of the people, becoming a die-hard faction of the Chinese Communist Party in South China. Xinhua Daily praised her as a "female hero." This is an interesting episode in the turbulent situation.

When the people are suffering endlessly and disasters are ravaging the entire Guangxi, this "granary of Guangxi" cannot escape the floods. The vast fertile plains are covered with water. From Yulin to Wuzhou, the losses are incalculable, especially in Cenxi and Wuzhou. The fields around the city are all submerged. Wuzhou is located at the confluence of the Pearl River and the Gui River. The floodwaters have completely submerged the entire city. The reporter is staying in a high-rise hotel and has to travel on the overpasses, climbing directly to Beishan to overlook the entire city. The vast mirage makes one sigh at the lack of pity from Heaven! (3rd)
