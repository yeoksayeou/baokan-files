### Recovery of Lu’an and Huangmei in Anhui and Hubei Provinces; Annihilation War Unfolds at Hongze Lake; Lu Troops Advance Towards Zhaoyuan and Laiyang

[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 17th] The National Army recovered Lu’an, an important town in western Anhui, at 8 a.m. on the 17th. The bandits fled towards Sujiabu and Huoshan, and are being pursued. National Army troops in the city are pacifying refugees and restoring order. Lu’an had been occupied by the bandits for exactly two weeks. Nanfenlukou, 70 li southwest of Hefei, has also been recovered, and the remaining bandits are being cleared in the Xijiaopodian area.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 17th] Strong units of the National Army launched an attack on Lu’an on the 16th. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to hold and fled towards Huoshan. Lu’an was recovered on the morning of the 17th. National Army troops entered the city to investigate the results of the battle and dispatched a team to pursue the bandits towards Huoshan. The county seat is expected to be captured soon.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 17th] (1) The Sixth Column of bandits fleeing towards Huangmei once attempted to invade the county seat. However, reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack, recovering Huangmei at dawn on the 17th. The remaining bandits fled east. (2) According to reports, the bandit Independent Column plans to establish a guerrilla zone in Zhutangdian, south of Xinyang and Luoshan, and another guerrilla zone in Lishan and the Dajilong and Xiaojilong Mountains. National Army troops are deploying closely to pursue and annihilate them.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 17th] A spokesman for the Army Headquarters stated: The Associated Press reported on the 14th that the bandit Liu Bocheng’s troops seized 150,000 Japanese-surrendered rifles and a large amount of ammunition from the Lu’an arsenal in western Anhui last week. This is completely fabricated. At that time, the Japanese troops (in western and central Anhui) were all designated to proceed to the areas along the Jinghu Railway to surrender. There is no reason why a large amount of weaponry and ammunition would be stored in this remote mountainous area.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 17th] A spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense on the 17th denied rumors that the Communist army had politically captured Anqing and Hukou, and also denied the report that Liu Bocheng’s troops had increased from 25,000 to 80,000. The spokesman stated: Currently, Liu’s troops number slightly more than 20,000.

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 17th] The reorganized 63rd Division today hosted the Wuhu press. Division Commander Lin Zhan stated: (1) Liu Bocheng's bandit troops are disturbing western and central Anhui and are temporarily occupying the Dabie Mountains. They will eventually be annihilated because they lack ammunition. (2) The Yangtze River defense is divided into sections for guard. It is impossible for large groups of Liu’s bandits to cross the river. Even if small groups sneak across, they can definitely be annihilated. (3) There is no need to worry about the defenses of Wuhu and areas to the west. [Our Newspaper, Huaiyin, 17th] The annihilation war at Hongze Lake has begun. The lakeside area is now under the control of strong National Army forces.

[Our Newspaper, Zhengzhou, 17th] Liu Bocheng's bandits have retreated to the foothills of the Dabie Mountains. His First and Seventh Columns have been broken up into smaller units, and only a small part of his Sixth Column, numbering about 1,000, has fled to Huanghai. The main force is only in the Hejiadian area north of Guangji. A portion of the bandits in western Henan are fleeing west along the railway, and another portion is fleeing southwest from Lushi Zhuyangzhen. Currently, the bandits in western Henan are echoing the bandits who have come south from the Jin-Shaanxi border region. The focus of the war situation has shifted west.

[Our Newspaper, Yanzhou, 17th] The fighting in the Yuncheng area of southwestern Shandong is still stalemated. In the Jiaodong area, after the highway from Yexian through Dianzi, Pingdu, Gugang, Liuzhuang, and Lingshan to Jimo Qingdao was opened, the National Army, in addition to clearing out scattered bandits on both sides of the highway, continued to advance towards Zhaoyuan and Laiyang. The National Navy and Air Force have been assisting ground troops in attacking bandit positions in various ports of the Shandong Peninsula for days, achieving repeated successes. It is rumored that the National Army...

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 17th] On the Shandong Peninsula, National Army troops advanced rapidly along the Lai(yang)-Ji(mo) and Lai(yang)-Ping(du) highways on the morning of the 16th, reaching... at dusk.

[Our Newspaper, Kaifeng, 16th] More than 50,000 troops under Chen Yi in western Shandong, divided into nine divisions, have been identified and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in Yuncheng.

### "September 18th"! The Northeast is as Cold as Early Winter; People are Filled with Emotions; Ma Zhanshan Hopes for Unity to Suppress the Rebellion and Build National Defense

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 17th] No decision has been made here regarding commemorative activities for "September 18th." However, with yellow leaves falling and autumn colors pervading, the end of autumn is near. Northeasterners are filled with emotion whenever they mention "September 18th." Although Shenyang is full of vitality, there is hope for sweeping changes throughout the Northeast. When asked, the elders of the Northeast said that Shenyang is now the rear area. They hope that the recovered areas and the unrecovered areas, as well as the entire Northeast, can be rescued within a time limit, especially the people trapped in the bandit areas who are hoping for this the most.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] There was heavy rain in Shenyang on the night of the 16th, and the 17th was as cold as early winter, with temperatures dropping to 60 degrees. Pedestrians huddled on the streets. On "September 18th," there were military exercises by the city defense troops, including infantry and artillery. Newspapers published articles commemorating the event, and the people were quietly filled with emotions.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] On the eve of "September 18th," Ma Zhanshan told reporters: The Northeast has been recovered for two years, but in the past two years, the country has been riddled with problems, and its status has declined daily, while Japan has been steadily improving. The only way forward is to unite to suppress the rebellion and prevent Japan from returning in ten years. At the same time, we should seize the foundation of industry and mining and build national defense, warning ambitious countries not to think of interfering, otherwise they will be taught a lesson.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 17th] Zheng Dongguo's thoughts on "September 18th": The current situation in the Northeast is more serious than it was then, and we must be more vigilant. We must do our best to suppress the rebellion and eliminate the bandits. The enemy has not openly provided assistance to the Communist bandits. The so-called Sixth Offensive may be launched at the end of the month or the beginning of next month, but there is no need to worry.

### Chief of Staff Chen Cheng Issues a Letter to the Military and Civilians of the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 17th] On the 16th anniversary of "September 18th," Chief of Staff and Director of the Northeast Xingyuan Chen Cheng issued a special letter to all military and civilians in the Northeast, explaining how to prevent a second "September 18th" from happening. The letter stated: The "September 18th" Incident was the beginning of Japan's invasion of China and the root cause of the outbreak of World War II. Since then, the Northeast has been occupied and ravaged by Japan, but Japan has also swallowed this bomb from that time and eventually suffered the consequences. Therefore, the Northeast's "September 18th" has a special historical significance, whether from the perspective of China, Japan, or the entire world, and is worthy of painful commemoration. Finally, Chen specifically warned all military and civilians in the Northeast that although the shameful deeds of "September 18th" have become a thing of the past, the terrible crisis in the Northeast has not diminished due to Japan's defeat. The "September 18th" Monument is still erected on Beiling Road, which is worthy of our vigilance. Everyone is in this dangerous situation and must guard their posts, focus on their jobs, give up personal temporary interests, and prioritize the permanent interests of the nation, striving to eliminate special treatment and bring everything back to normal. Only in this way can we weather the storm together and overcome difficulties.

### Dong Xian Guang Speaks on the Position on the Japanese Peace Conference at a Press Conference

Personnel from the Resources Commission Studying in the United States to Return Home Immediately

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Government Information Office of the Executive Yuan hosted a press conference in the afternoon of the 17th, presided over by Dong Xian Guang, who answered the question of "What is China's position on the Japanese peace treaty? If the Soviet Union does not attend the eleven-nation conference, will China attend?" He stated: The Chinese government's attitude towards the US government's convening of the Japanese peace conference has been fully clarified by Foreign Minister Wang before his trip to the United States on the 5th of this month. Regarding the Japanese peace treaty, the Chinese government has consistently maintained that a satisfactory and definitive result cannot be obtained without the unanimous support of the countries concerned. If any major power alone concludes a peace treaty with Japan, we will not be able to resolve the major issues arising from the Pacific and Far East wars, and the purpose of the treaty will be defeated. The Chinese government hopes that its efforts to promote the participation of all relevant governments in the Japanese peace conference will bear fruit in the early conclusion of a treaty with Japan.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Director Dong of the Government Information Office stated at a press conference today that it was reported last week that someone suggested that China's dispatch of personnel abroad consumes a large amount of foreign exchange each year, and that this fund could be used to improve domestic universities, and mentioned that there are currently 400 employees of the Resources Commission interning in the United States. According to the person in charge of the Resources Commission, the commission sent a group of outstanding personnel in various industries to the United States for internships during and after the war, mainly those interning under the Lend-Lease Act, who were handled according to the government's general plan. In addition, there were also designers of the Three Gorges Project and those participating in internships at Westinghouse Electric Corporation, with a total number of about 400 people. In early May of this year, in view of the urgent need for technical personnel for domestic restoration and the tight national foreign exchange situation, the commission formulated detailed measures and telegraphed all interns to return home within a time limit. The design work of the Three Gorges project was ordered to be stopped, so all personnel have also returned home. Currently, about 250 people have returned home and are participating in the restoration work in the recovered areas. Another 60 people are waiting for ships to return home. Currently, there are only about 90 people still interning in the United States, including more than 50 Westinghouse company interns and 40 Lend-Lease Act interns who were ordered to assist in wartime production and delayed their departure. The above personnel will return home as soon as their internship period expires.

English gold loans were established and completed, the Nanchang Hydropower Plant was established, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was built in cooperation with French banking groups. Bridges, roadbeds, and tunnels have been completed, and the construction of the Nanning to Zhennanguan railway is also mostly completed.

### Chen Guangfu's Written Speech at the Foreign Trade Conference; Hoping for Cooperation between Industry and Commerce to Conserve, Increase Production, and Promote Exports

[Our City News] Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, delivered a written speech at yesterday's National Foreign Trade Conference (for details of the conference, please see page 7) as follows:

Chinese Merchants in the Past Did Not Understand Foreign Trade

Since China opened to trade with foreign countries, it has always been in an unfavorable position in foreign trade. Except for the occasional year or two of surplus, there has always been an excess of imports over exports, sometimes tens of millions of yuan, sometimes four or five hundred million yuan. Fortunately, we still have a very important intangible income, that is, remittances from overseas Chinese, which offset a large part of the excess imports. Speaking of our exports, we still rely on foreigners' promotion. For example, soybeans were able to be exported in large quantities after the Japanese used various convenient methods in the Northeast and promoted and publicized them abroad. Another example is tung oil and pig bristles. Chinese merchants mostly only transport them to Hankou and Shanghai. As for how to transport them out, how to promote them, and how to standardize the quality, foreign firms have been devising methods. At that time, Chinese merchants rarely understood the foreign market and promotion situation, so they rarely could export directly themselves.

Developing Foreign Trade, Paying Attention to Agricultural Product Processing

Everyone generally says that industry is important, and this is certainly true, but trade is even more important. Because whether it is domestic trade or foreign trade, this kind of "exchanging what you have for what you don't have" can achieve the effect of "making the most of everything" so that "goods are not abandoned on the ground." In other words, it is "exchanging what you have for what you don't have," which is the highest utility in economic principles. For example, our tung oil and pig bristles cannot be consumed so much in the country. If they are not transported out, they become waste. If we export them and exchange them for machines, wouldn't our industrial goals be partly built through trade? Moreover, we are now an agricultural country. Exports are all agricultural products, and the export of these agricultural products all requires separate processing in order to make trade more developed. Therefore, when we build industries, we should first focus on the processing industries of agricultural products. All of the above words seem to have not much to do with the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee, but in fact they are necessary conditions for seeking foreign exchange balance. The work of the Balance Committee is now based on income and expenditure for foreign exchange. If we can find ways to promote foreign trade, our foreign exchange income will naturally increase, and we can use this income to build industries and purchase machines. Wouldn't the construction of our industries be successfully built from trade? So I say that trade is even more important than industry.

Hoping that Foreign Exchange Income Can Gradually Increase

Now, the general public seems to be very concerned about the Balance Committee, but does not pay much attention to using this opportunity to promote trade. Today, your committee is discussing foreign trade issues, and it has truly grasped the core of the current issue. You are either businessmen from friendly countries coming to China for business, or commercial leaders from various places. We are confident that after the meeting, you will definitely cooperate with each other and use this opportunity to give full play to the effectiveness of our Chinese foreign trade. This is worthy of admiration, especially the Balance Committee is more concerned about future foreign trade, and hopes that foreign exchange income can gradually increase so that both imports and exports can meet our needs. As for the black market problem, under the management of trade, unless there is comprehensive control, the black market is bound to arise. For example, there is a black market for train tickets and boat tickets, and there is also a black market for theater tickets. There are black markets in many, many aspects, and not only China has them, but all countries have black markets. I can say that the day we cannot open free trade and cannot provide unlimited foreign exchange, the black market will always be unavoidable, but the existence of the black market does not necessarily fundamentally harm the legitimate market. Now our foreign exchange is acting rationally according to the actual situation at any time, and it can be hoped that exports can be promoted and overseas Chinese remittances will not be leaked.

(2) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the Representative Office in Japan telegraphed that all Taiwanese overseas Chinese only restored their nationality in October last year and have not yet completed two years. According to Article 6 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law, they have no right to vote or be elected. Huang Yanfu, Chairman of the General Association of Overseas Chinese in Japan, is a Taiwanese overseas Chinese who restored his nationality last year. Whether he can be the chairman of the election office in the Japanese region should be clarified. Resolution: The provisions of the original method are for ordinary people who voluntarily transfer their nationality. The nationality of the people of Taiwan Province is due to the loss and restoration of the territory, and is not comparable to those who voluntarily transfer their nationality. Therefore, it is not restricted by the above-mentioned legal provisions and should have the right to vote and be elected. Huang Tingfu can also still be the chairman of the election office in the Japanese region.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Xu Fulin, a key member of the Democratic Socialist Party and current government commissioner, told reporters on the 17th that although the party's nominations for participation in the national general election have been agreed upon within the party, they have not yet been submitted to the government because the proportional distribution problem jointly negotiated by the three parties has not yet been decided. The government wants the two parties to submit the list, but the two parties hope that the government will finalize the proportion, so the party's list cannot be submitted first when no results have been obtained in principle.

### Reduction and Exemption of Farmland Tax Due to Disaster: Standards Stipulated by the Ministry of Food

No Reduction or Exemption for Harvests of 60% or More

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Food said: "The determination of the percentage of disaster reduction and exemption is based on the total amount of harvest in a normal year in the disaster-stricken land. Those with a harvest of less than 20% will be exempted from all taxes, those with a harvest of 20% or more but less than 30% will be reduced or exempted from 80% of farmland tax, those with a harvest of 30% or more but less than 40% will be reduced or exempted from 70%, those with a harvest of 40% or more but less than 50% will be reduced or exempted from 60%, and those with a harvest of 50% or more but less than 60% will be reduced or exempted from 50%. No reduction or exemption will be granted for harvests in the middle range of 60% or more." The decision on the reduction and exemption standards is based on the reports of farmers in the disaster-stricken areas. The county government, together with the Farmland and Food Department or the Farmland Management Agency, dispatches personnel for preliminary investigation. The provincial government supervises the Civil Affairs Department (or the Land Administration Bureau in provinces with a Land Administration Bureau), Finance Department, and Farmland and Food Department to dispatch personnel for re-investigation. The provincial government, based on the serious disaster situation, reports those in areas in dire need of relief to the central competent relief agency for verification and handling. According to the Ministry of Social Affairs: Disaster relief lies in being swift and timely. Therefore, at the beginning of disasters in various places, appropriate relief is given based on reports from various places or direct investigations, and it is not based on the figures of tax reduction and exemption.

The Committee has established youth guidance offices and secondary school refresher classes, vocational training classes, and teacher training institutes in provinces and cities such as North China, Northeast China, and Jiangsu. There are more than 50 guidance and training institutions that specialize in receiving youth who have fled from bandit areas, providing them with remedial education or simple vocational training, and then assisting them in returning to school or finding employment. In the past two years, the Committee has provided relief and guidance to 209,256 people in 1946 and 266,315 people in the first half of this year. However, since the expansion of the communist rebellion, the number of youth fleeing from bandit areas has been increasing daily.

### Chen Guangfu's Written Statement: Continued from Page One; Must Be Frugal and Economical; Increase Production and Promote Exports

The present is a transitional period. We lack US dollars, just like all countries in the world, so we cannot but save money. Take the United Kingdom as an example. It has a four-hundred-year history of trade surplus, and it is also a leader in economics, currency, and shipping. However, since the two world wars, the difficulties have been "deep". After the First World War, the gold standard was abolished, and this time the exchange of US dollars was suspended. The government and the public are living a hard life with a firm spirit, practicing economy, and trying to increase exports. Their spirit can be emulated by us. The lives of our ordinary people are so low that they cannot be lower. Now the promotion of economy is to be practiced by those of us who come here to attend meetings and some of the richer people who live in Shanghai. In the future, we will strictly practice economy, and at the same time, everyone will work hard to increase production, promote exports, work together with one heart, live within our means, and rely on our own efforts to overcome this difficult stage. Mr. Hu Puan said in his book "The Cultivation of Confucianism" that we should eat simply, so that we can reduce desires. If desires are reduced, various improper events of greed for wealth can be reduced. This is the spirit of Confucianism combined with Buddhism. For thousands of years, our China has been governing the family with simplicity. Our Chinese living situation cannot now follow the example of the industrially developed United States. If we want to imitate the living standards of Americans, we will have to wait until our industry is also developed. Otherwise, our national strength will be invisibly consumed in this desire for enjoyment, and it will be difficult to recover. Recently, everyone advocates self-reliance, which is the philosophy of self-reliance.

This new foreign exchange method is just a measure during the transitional period. I was recommended by the Central Bank to preside over it, and the regulations are still being approved. The advantages of the new method were mentioned by Mr. Zhang Yujiu at the meeting the day before yesterday: "Because the foreign exchange rate maintained a 'pegged' policy in the past, it was difficult to maintain exports after several price changes. The new method was promulgated in August, changing the past 'pegged' official price to a flexible market price." Successive price changes are all aimed at promoting exports. The pegged rate is not intended to maintain stability, but in fact it cannot be achieved as expected. Therefore, the flexible rate is adopted, which is to make it possible for China to promote exports. Recently, our foreign exchange revenue and expenditure situation has improved, and the imbalance has been reduced by 50% compared with before. These are all enlightened measures taken by our government authorities, as well as realistic plans implemented by the Central Bank under the leadership of Mr. Zhang Gongquan, and the results of the day and night review of many people in the event. I am in my twilight years and reluctantly take on this matter, and I am ashamed that I have made no contribution.

How to Eradicate the Black Market Depends on the Cooperation of the Government and the Public

Speaking of eliminating the black market, the most important thing is to rely on economic means, that is, to reduce demand. Whether demand can be reduced is a difficult question. If everyone does not ask the black market to buy foreign exchange, then no one needs black market foreign exchange, and it will naturally not rise. If the black market does not rise, then domestic prices will stabilize, and the cost of export goods will naturally not increase. Whoever only cares about private affairs and disregards the public, and strives to satisfy his own desires by asking the black market to obtain foreign exchange, and only seeks his own convenience, the harm to the public and the impact on various economic problems are indescribable. Therefore, it is hoped that whether a policy can be effective depends entirely on whether the people of the country can fully cooperate, which is the most important thing. Therefore, it is hoped that after the meeting, everyone will go back and lead the industrial and commercial circles to cooperate together to overcome the current difficulties.

Editorial

### Painful Memories and Bright Prospects

The arrival of the "September 18th Incident" will inevitably evoke painful memories in every Chinese person. These memories are multifaceted, recalling the various encounters of the past sixteen years: the decline and demise of Japanese imperialism, the victorious completion of the Chinese nation's historical struggle, and the evolution of various international relations over these sixteen years. Faced with the current situation of China and the world, as the anniversary arrives, learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, we cannot but be vigilant.

We must first point out that we are a nation with a rich historical consciousness. For two thousand years, we have been immersed in Confucian traditions, and we are not a nation that values emotions alone, but one that values both emotions and reason. In terms of emotions, we do not wish to emphasize the recounting of our painful experiences. Today, the Japanese militarists have collapsed, and Japan is undergoing a rebirth, moving towards the path of democracy. After this painful experience, the Chinese and Japanese nations should be able to cooperate closely from now on. There should be no more growth of seeds of jealousy between the peoples. In this sense, we hope that the Japanese people can truly encounter a new life and move towards the path of democracy after the collapse of the militarists. Precisely because of this, we cannot help but harbor considerable anxiety about the recent news from Japan. The continued existence of conservative and even reactionary forces, the remnants of feudalism and even militarism, are now disguised in democratic garb and openly disseminated. All of this may be due to the tolerance of the occupying authorities, but in reality, it may not necessarily be beneficial to the Japanese people. On the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," we must raise this point to urge the attention of the occupying authorities and the Japanese people.

Of course, the "September 18th Incident" reminds us of the impotence of the League of Nations at the time, which ultimately led humanity to the calamity of World War II. The Chinese people, feeling the impotence of the League of Nations, had long yearned for the emergence of a strong international organization. Therefore, the Chinese people place ardent expectations and sincere support on the United Nations, which was born from the blood shed in World War II. All of humanity around the world must ensure that this international organization can fully exercise its powers in order to ensure world peace. Within our scope, due to our own painful experiences, our sincere support for this United Nations organization goes without saying. However, unfortunately, since the establishment of this international organization, all of its activities have not necessarily lived up to the ideals of the world. We cannot say that any country has a conspiracy to destroy this organization. The reason why it has not lived up to our ideals is just like a newborn baby being prone to diseases. We must take good care of it so that the baby can grow and develop into adulthood.

Today, we commemorate the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," already in the third year after our victory in the War of Resistance, and the situation in the Northeast has not yet returned to normal, which inevitably evokes many emotions in us. We deeply know that the development of the situation in the Northeast and even the entire post-war China has both internal and external factors at play. In terms of the internal aspect, this is obviously due to the rebellion of the communist bandits. Therefore, today, as we commemorate this painful day, we must devote all our efforts to complete our suppression of the rebellion in the shortest possible time. After the bandit rebellion is suppressed, the situation in the Northeast will not be difficult to return to normal quickly. In terms of the external aspect, the development of the post-war situation in China to the current stage is mainly due to the lack of a clear and firm policy from Washington. Vice President Sun pointed out when he met with reporters from the Associated Press yesterday that the United States' Far East policy is not firm enough and is too vague. As a result, on the one hand, it has created the arrogance of the communist bandits today, and on the other hand, it has aroused the suspicion of the Soviet Union, thus affecting the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty to some extent. As Vice President Sun said: "China must struggle between the two powers so that it can adapt itself to the most advantageous position for the present and the long-term future." We have now reached a time when we need to make a new decision, and this decision will undoubtedly be extremely important to our future national destiny.

Looking forward from painful memories, we can easily see a bright future. Although our current situation is extremely difficult, we should strengthen our self-confidence even more in the midst of hardship. We have come through the arduous War of Resistance, mainly because we have an unshakable belief, a belief that the War of Resistance will be won. Now that the situation is not as we wish, we should strengthen our belief that national construction will be successful. An unshakable belief is the cornerstone of all success. With this belief, we will have brilliant hope, and thus we can see a bright future. It is useless to simply sink into painful memories. We must see our bright future from painful memories and raise our beliefs.

Reconstruction of Foreign Trade

The National Foreign Trade Conference is scheduled to close today. This newspaper has already commented on the convening of this conference. As it closes today, we would like to say a few more words. Everyone feels the difficulty of our country's current economic situation. To overcome the current crisis, the main thing is how to rebuild our export trade. This not only requires plans and programs, but also focuses on implementation. Since China opened to foreign trade, our export trade has always been under the control of foreign merchants. If our country now wants to rebuild our export trade, it should naturally take the interests of the nation and the people as the primary consideration.

Speaking of developing our country's foreign trade, this is not only closely related to our country's foreign exchange assets, but also to our great cause of national construction. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan has already issued a written statement on this, and Mr. Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, has also issued a written statement to the conference. It can be seen that the government is paying attention to foreign trade. Mr. Chen's remarks are sincere in every sentence, from the way of being a person to trade and economics, and are especially worthy of our deep consideration. He said: "Those who only care about their own interests and do not care about everyone, using the black market to strive for (foreign exchange) to satisfy their own desires, only care about their own convenience, their invisible harm to the public, and the impact on various economic problems, is indescribable." As the Foreign Trade Conference closes, we hope that traders engaged in exports can sincerely cooperate with the government authorities to rebuild our export trade.

### Marshall Urges Reform of the United Nations System, Suggests Establishing a New Executive Body to Handle International Disputes, Vyshinsky Delays Submitting a Reply

[Report from this newspaper] New York, broadcast on the 17th: After US Secretary of State Marshall delivered his policy speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky suddenly requested to withdraw the speech originally scheduled to be delivered this afternoon. The motive is unknown. According to general speculation, it may be that the Soviet side needs time to fully study Marshall's speech, or even needs to wait for new instructions from Moscow. As for when Vyshinsky will deliver the Soviet Union's policy speech to the General Assembly, there is no sign to be found. It is reported that Vyshinsky requested the United Nations to put his name on the list of speakers for today on Tuesday. Later, after learning that Marshall's speech launched a major attack on the Soviet Union, he suddenly changed his original intention.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, broadcast on the 17th: The organizational work of the United Nations General Assembly was completed last night, and the general debate began today. US Secretary of State Marshall spoke first, and other speakers are scheduled to be representatives from the Soviet Union, Mexico, Poland, Canada, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia.

[United Press New York, 17th Electric Report] US Secretary of State Marshall declared today that the United States accepts the strict restrictions on the veto power of the five permanent members in the Security Council, and formally proposes the establishment of a 55-nation Standing Committee in the United Nations General Assembly to maintain continued meetings. He said that this proposal has nothing to do with admitting that the Security Council has completely failed. He proposed the establishment of a Standing Committee, which is a concrete and microcosmic United Nations General Assembly that meets all year round to monitor the world and the Security Council, so that it can participate and make recommendations when the Security Council fails to fulfill its mission as needed.

Marshall made this proposal in his address during the debate at the opening of the General Assembly today, which was Marshall's first shot in the current stage of the US-Soviet diplomatic war. Soviet representative Vyshinsky is scheduled to reply this afternoon.

Marshall did not mince his words. He warned that the world is facing a crisis, and urged the representatives of the General Assembly to pay attention to the fact that people all over the world are deeply afraid that "they will be involved in a new and more terrible conflict." He did not hesitate to put all the blame for the world's chaos on the Soviet Union. He directly accused the Soviet Union of obstructing the actions of the United Nations, failing to stop the acts of hostility and aggression against Greece, and putting all the blame for delaying the independence of Korea on the Soviet Union.

Marshall touched on all the main issues that the General Assembly should debate this time, and described the US plans and policies in various degrees of detail. Including:

Seven Major Problems Urgently Need Solutions

(1) "The Veto Power Problem": The United States is willing to constitutionally accept the cancellation of the veto power in terms of non-UN member states applying for membership and implementing all resolutions of the Security Council, only if the proposed method is excessive, but resolutions involving the Security Council's judicial actions are not included. Mr. Ma also advocated the establishment of a special committee to study how to eliminate the problem of "abuse" of the veto power, so as to submit a report to the next General Assembly, so that there can be improvements in the voting rules.

(2) "Increasing the Power of the General Assembly Problem": Marshall advocated the establishment of a special Standing Committee of the General Assembly composed of 55 countries, called the "Interim Committee," dedicated to studying issues related to peace and security, with a term of one year, and then submitting a report to the next General Assembly on whether there is a need to change the committee to a permanent one.

(3) "Korean Issue": Marshall admitted that it was impossible to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, and asked the General Assembly to find a way to achieve the independence of Korea without going through the trusteeship stage. He promised to put forward concrete proposals soon, but for the time being, he will submit this issue to all countries and ask them to make a "fair judgment."

(4) "Greek Issue": He called on the General Assembly to adopt a resolution condemning South, Bulgaria, and Albania for the crime of aggression against Hope, demanding that the countries stop aiding the Greek guerrillas, and establishing a UN General Assembly committee to implement the resolution and investigate whether they are obeying.

(5) "Atomic Energy Problem": Marshall warned that if a consensus cannot be reached on this issue, the US concession on the internationalization of atomic bombs will have to be revised. He also said that if the Soviet Union refuses to cooperate with most countries on this issue, the Atomic Energy Commission will report to the General Assembly that it cannot accomplish the task of international effective control of atomic energy.

(6) "Disarmament Problem": The United States firmly opposes any reduction in armaments until the German-Japanese peace treaty is signed, the Security Council has military power, and an agreement on international control of atomic energy is obtained before this can be done.

(7) "Palestinian Issue": The United States attaches great importance to the recommendations passed by the United Nations Special Committee and endorsed by most countries. Among the recommendations endorsed by most countries, there is a recommendation to divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab regions.

### The US's Far-Reaching European Plan May Be Discussed by the General Assembly

[United Press New York, 16th Electric Report] President Truman's two major policies, the Truman Doctrine to prevent communism and the Marshall Plan to revive Europe, will be discussed at the current General Assembly. Senior members of the US delegation declared today that if the Soviet Union does not raise objections to these two policies and force the General Assembly to debate them, the United States is also prepared to automatically submit them for discussion. The US delegation has had this plan in repeated meetings, believing that this move can greatly increase the prestige of the General Assembly and show the US's support for the General Assembly. US policy for this session of the General Assembly has been clarified by Secretary of State Marshall, who decided to strengthen the position of the General Assembly in all aspects in order to save the Security Council from the repeated use of the veto power by the Soviet Union, resulting in a situation where it is becoming increasingly helpless. Submitting President Truman's two major policies to the General Assembly for discussion is a concrete manifestation of this policy, and its significance is extremely important.

### Foreign Minister Wang's Broadcast Address: The Veto Power Should Be Subject to Reasonable Restrictions, Urges All Countries to Abandon All Selfish Interests

[Central News Agency Flushing Meadow, 16th Electric Report] At the invitation of the United Nations Broadcasting Group, Foreign Minister Wang gave a broadcast address in Mandarin today on the importance of the current session of the General Assembly to the country. Foreign Minister Wang said that the veto power issue is now generally focused on, but it is not the root problem facing the United Nations. The truly important issue is whether the member states of the Security Council are determined to cooperate and give the United Nations enthusiastic support. Only such cooperation can lay a sound foundation for the United Nations. Otherwise, the United Nations will not be able to take appropriate action. The strength of the United Nations comes from its member states. If the member states of the United Nations do not cooperate and give the United Nations support, then the United Nations will naturally be weak and incompetent.

Regarding the veto power issue, Foreign Minister Wang reiterated that the Chinese delegation believes that the only feasible measure is for the United Nations General Assembly to "make appropriate interpretations of the United Nations Charter," and impose reasonable restrictions on the use of the veto power. Foreign Minister Wang called on all national policies to aim at internationalism, and should not only care about one's own selfish interests. He said that the establishment of a collective security system cannot be completed quickly. Therefore, he asked the people of the country not to be disappointed or troubled by the many serious difficulties that have occurred, but to redouble their efforts and strive for the ideals of the United Nations.

### Viet Minh Chairman Ho Chi Minh Reportedly Has Been Temporarily Executed by French Troops

[Report from this newspaper, Hong Kong, 17th Electric Report] According to Vietnamese news obtained from a certain source here, it is rumored that Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Viet Minh government, has been arrested by French troops and subjected to the cruel punishment of beheading. The Viet Minh is in a state of leaderlessness, and the revolutionary action has been suspended. Therefore, the recent situation in Vietnam has been unusually quiet, and there is a new development in which the deposed King Bao Dai is considering taking over the government again. It is reported that this news is still a top secret, and a certain country may be preparing to arrange the political situation in Vietnam to its desired state before making an appropriate announcement, so as to avoid world public opinion from attacking the uncivilized behavior used in handling this matter.

### The Fourteen-Member Steering Committee Has Been Organized, and the Soviet Delegation Only Occupies Two Seats

[Central News Agency Flushing, 16th Electric Report] The United Nations General Assembly has completed the organization of the Steering Committee. The fourteen-member committee includes one chairman of the conference, seven vice-chairmen, and six chairmen of the main committees. That is, China, Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Luxembourg, Chile, Poland, New Zealand, India, Syria, Mexico, Cuba, and other fourteen countries. The committee's duties are to recommend to the General Assembly which issues should be included in the agenda, and it is expected to become the first place for direct conflict between East and West.

### The International Monetary Fund Decides to Allocate US$60 Million to the UK Specifically for Accepting British Pounds in the Future

[Reuters London, 17th Electric Report] The British Treasury announced tonight that the International Monetary Fund has agreed to allocate US$60 million to the UK for accepting British pounds within the next few months.

[Reuters London, 17th Electric Report] The second annual meeting of the International Bank and Monetary Fund, which was originally scheduled to end in two weeks, will end today due to smooth progress.

Decision to Establish an Advisory Committee

The General Assembly yesterday passed a resolution to establish a nine-member national advisory committee. The current consultants are: Chairman: Chartre (UK); Bank: Brown (US); Commerce: Hoover (US); Industry: Harkness (Canada); Labor: Ruhr (France); Agriculture: Bartron (Peru); Science: Raymond (India) Economy; Robbins (UK); Other activities; She Ji (China)

The Door to Aid to Europe Has Been Opened

According to authoritative sources, the discussion at this meeting has been very successful, but the door to financial aid from these two institutions to the countries concerned is still only open.

### Sino-American Initiators Hold Midnight Meeting on Empty Stomachs; Draft Agreement for Joint Power Plant Completed; Capital of US$20 Million, Half Each from China and the U.S.; Electricity Generation Target of 100,000 Kilowatts per Day

[Report from our newspaper] In order to fundamentally solve the city's electricity shortage, the Municipal Council decided to form the "Shanghai United Power Plant" during its first general meeting. For more than a year, the Bureau of Public Utilities has been planning and promoting this. As the fourth general meeting of the Municipal Council is about to convene, the bureau, recognizing that the city's electricity shortage has reached such a serious stage and that a fundamental solution is urgently needed, invited responsible persons from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and various power companies to hold a preparatory meeting for the joint power company the day before yesterday. According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, who told reporters: The preparatory meeting did not end until 11 o'clock the night before. The Sino-American initiators participating in the meeting each sacrificed their dinner, and the draft agreement for the joint power company was finally completed. It will be submitted to the Municipal Government meeting for discussion tomorrow, and then submitted by the Municipal Government to this session of the Municipal Council for approval, and then sent to the Executive Yuan for record, so as to promote its establishment in the shortest possible time.

According to reporter's inquiries: The organizational draft agreement of the Shanghai United Power Company adopts a Sino-American joint venture model, but is actually a Chinese company, and everything will comply with Chinese laws. Its purpose is the cooperation between Chinese and American business circles. The company's capital is set at US$20 million, with China and the U.S. each accounting for half of the capital as a principle, adopting a public share offering method to welcome investment from the American business community, but with a limit of US$10 million. The remaining US$10 million, in addition to the existing power companies in the city subscribing for shares and becoming basic units, the balance will be solicited from influential people in the business community. As for funds from nationalities other than Chinese and American, there are no plans to raise them for the time being.

The detailed provisions of the company's organizational draft agreement will be announced after it is passed by the Municipal Council. Yesterday, Director Zhao solemnly stated to reporters: The electricity generation target after the establishment of the United Power Company has also been decided, which is "to require the company to supply the city with 100,000 kilowatts of electricity per day within five years." If this goal can be achieved, the phenomenon of electricity shortage will not recur in Shanghai.

### Eryk, Still Outside the Port; Soviet Side Suddenly Claims It is Still in Vladivostok

[Report from our newspaper] After the news that the Soviet ship "Eryk," disregarding our laws, was planning to sail to Shanghai again, our government and all sectors of society have paid close attention to it. Reporters learned yesterday from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the ship had not yet entered the Wusongkou as of last night and was still anchored 20 miles outside the Wusongkou.

### Xu Xueyu's Letter to Jian Guansan Clarifying Treatment

[Report from our newspaper] During the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th, when discussing the provision of living loans to civil servants, Committee Member Jian Guansan pointed out that the manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) receives a monthly salary of 15 million yuan in addition to the car and Western-style house provided by the government, which is 10 million yuan more than the President of the Yuan. It is learned that Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the CMSNC, sent a special letter to Jian Guansan in response to this, making some clarifications. Excerpts from the original letter are as follows: I have investigated and found that it is true that the CMSNC provides Xueyu with a car for official business. As for my residence at No. 7, Lane 1350, Lin Sen Middle Road, Shanghai, it is a lane house that I share with Mr. Bao Keyong, an advisor to the Ministry of Communications. I rent it entirely myself and pay the rent monthly, which has nothing to do with the CMSNC. As for Xueyu's salary, since the CMSNC implemented the cost of living index system in January 1946, it has been completely suspended. Later, at the strong request of both the Board of Directors and the Ministry of Communications, I received it according to the central government's regulations for civil servants starting in July of the same year, and there is no other income (for example, the public expense salary in August totaled 2,437,084 yuan). I hereby present the facts in detail, hoping for your understanding. Moreover, I deeply admire the fact that this meeting of the Yuan expressed the suffering of all civil servants and studied improvements, with lofty discussions and profound opinions, which coincides with my humble views. Corruption is not inherent in human nature, but entirely due to the pressure of life. If we ignore the hardship of their lives and only sing the high-pitched tune of strict prohibition, we are truly neglecting the root and focusing on the branches. The lack of effectiveness can be foreseen. The gentlemen of the Yuan, in their legislative position, are seeking fundamental relief for all civil servants, which is no less than saving all sentient beings.

### Loud Noise on the Huangpu River; Iron Buckets Fly High; Black Smoke Rises Straight Up; Iron Barge Loading Cargo Explodes and Sinks; Four Men and Women Injured and Missing

[Report from our newspaper] At around 4:50 PM yesterday, an iron barge at the Gonghexiang Wharf suddenly exploded in the cabin. The iron barge was ship number 749 of the China Transport Company. Yesterday, it was extracting sixty boxes of Western medicine and twelve iron buckets of chemicals (sodium perchlorate) from the Danish ship "Gland Tomast Mast Mac" docked at the wharf. Because they were dangerous goods, customs officials sealed the cabin after loading. At this time, white smoke came out of the cabin. At first, no one suspected an accident, but suddenly a wave came and the ship was shaken, causing the iron buckets in the cabin to collide and suddenly explode. With two loud bangs, iron buckets and ship boards flew several feet high. At this time, in addition to the Danish ship docked at the wharf, there was also the CMSNC's "Hai" ship, which was also unloading cargo at the wharf. While hundreds of workers were busy, they suddenly heard two consecutive explosions similar to bombs and saw iron buckets and ship boards flying high. In an instant, they panicked and ran away. The wharf was extremely chaotic. In an instant, the smoke from the iron barge shot straight into the sky. After learning about this, the customs immediately dispatched a fire-fighting launch to put out the fire. After learning that it was a dangerous goods explosion, they dispatched another small tugboat to tow the iron barge to the Pudong Lujiazui riverside, a deep-water area, and sank it to prevent further explosions. After the incident, it was checked that the wharf and the two large ships were undamaged. There were a total of four men, two women, and one child on the iron barge. A total of three people are missing and one is injured. The missing persons are the helmsman (the boss) Hu Yibing, 30 years old, from Anhui. Seaman A Si, 38 years old, from Jiangbei. The wife of the second boss, Jia Zhangshi, 30 years old, is about to give birth. The three are presumed to have been killed in the explosion or sunk in the Huangpu River, which cannot be proven. The injured was Hu Yibing's wife, whose right thigh was blown into a hole. She was rescued by the customs launch to the Xinguankou dock and sent to the hospital for bandaging before being discharged. The second boss happened to be issuing bamboo chips on the Danish ship when the explosion occurred, so he was not harmed. The cook and the child (Hu Yibing's son) both escaped without injury. The child has been taken care of by relatives. As for the aftermath, it remains to be decided by the China Transport Company.

### Landing Craft Sinks Sailboat; Four Boatmen Fall into Water and are Rescued

The stern of the small sailboat was crushed instantly, and it overturned immediately, with the bottom facing the sky. The Customs launch immediately sailed to rescue them. It was later learned that four boatmen were rescued by the launch and taken to the Customs Port Police Station. The overturned ship was also towed by the Port Police Station launch to Lujiazui in Pudong and anchored. After the accident, the landing craft did not stop and continued to sail south.

### Adjusting Farmland Distribution; Reviving the Rural Economy; Zhu Ping Suggests at the National Political Conference

[Report from our newspaper] The National Land Administration Conference will be held in Nanjing on the 26th of this month. Land administration directors and land experts from various provinces and cities will attend. Zhu Ping, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau, has drafted a proposal on "Promptly Implementing Farmland Reform to Develop the Rural Economy, Stabilize Farmers' Lives, and Complete the Great Cause of Suppressing Rebellion and Building the Nation," which will be submitted to the conference for discussion. It advocates adjusting farmland distribution to support owner-farmers and assist tenant farmers, so that tillers have their own land, and implementing agricultural mechanization to revive the rural economy. Excerpts from its content are as follows:

Adjusting Farmland Tax Burden

(1) Promptly conduct a survey of the status of tenant farmers and owner-farmers and the land they cultivate, and complete it within a specified time. (2) The county (city) governments should guide landlords to establish rent collection boards and rent collection offices, and guide tenant farmers to organize rent payment unions to implement joint rent collection and joint rent payment. If there are any tenancy issues, the government should resolve them reasonably in accordance with the central government's decisions. (3) Adjust the farmland tax burden and implement reasonable progressive tax rates to reduce landlords' unearned income and force them to abandon their conservative ideas of investing in land and enjoying rent, and shift their investment to economic construction projects.

Investing in Economic Construction

(4) The central government should consider the situation in each province and city and rationally set the maximum amount of privately owned land separately. The excess portion will be collected by the Farmers Bank in installments by issuing land bonds. (Land bonds will be amortized over the years). (5) The annual amortization amount of land bonds obtained by landlords should be guided by the government to invest in economic projects, such as establishing new agricultural tool factories, fertilizer factories, pest control drug factories, electricity and machine irrigation projects, agricultural product processing projects, special product development projects, and agricultural warehouses. (6) After equalizing land rights, the government should guide farmers to organize cooperative farms (inland provinces) and collective farms (remote provinces) in stages and areas, to achieve agricultural collectivization, mechanization, and the implementation of cultivation methods. In addition, state-owned farms should be established to take on the task of technical guidance and demonstration.

### Three Young Women from Suzhou, Seeking Employment, Forced into Prostitution

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhou Cuie (17 years old), Zhao Eryuan (17 years old), and Du Genxian (18 years old), three young women from Suzhou, recently came to Shanghai to work as domestic helpers. Zhou and Zhao worked for the Zhang family at 16 Pupo Lane, Chongqing South Road, and Du worked as a helper at No. 12 in the same lane. Due to their shared hometown, they were very close to Zhu Meiying (23 years old), who lived at 7 Yanchang Lane, 74 Yuanchang Road.

Recently, Zhou and the other two girls quit their jobs due to low wages and stayed at 207 Wanyi Lane, Chongqing South Road. At the beginning of this month, Zhou and the other two girls went to Zhu Meiying asking for a job introduction. Zhu readily agreed, but unexpectedly had malicious intentions.

### Xikang Yi Ethnic Group Petition Delegation Expresses Beliefs to Reporter from This Newspaper, The New Tide of the Anning River

[Reported from Nanjing on the 14th by this newspaper] In the triangle area of Sichuan, Kang, and Yunnan, on both sides of the Jinsha River, in the peaks and valleys of the longitudinal mountain range, is the living world of the Yi ethnic compatriots. With Xichang as the center, or along the Anning River, a tributary of the Yalong River, it was formerly the gateway for opium smuggling. Today, it is the main road for importing new concepts, new knowledge, and new lifestyles. The Yi ethnic compatriots have discovered the remoteness of their region, which has prevented them from receiving sufficient attention, and believe that if democracy does not permeate all parts of the country, it is a double misfortune for both the Yi ethnic compatriots and the country. Therefore, they spontaneously decided to petition in the capital. The inconvenience of transportation and excessive obstacles were overcome. After passing through Kunming and Chongqing, they gathered in the capital. They first told reporters about the purpose of this petition:

"The purpose of our petition is to ensure that we have the opportunity to report the situation of our ethnic group to the government from time to time. Participating in legislation is to ensure that the laws enacted in the future are applicable in border areas. Participating in supervision is to promote the legal and reasonable conduct of all political, economic, and cultural matters in border areas. Participating in the provincial assembly is to ensure that all bills take into account the interests of the people and gain their support, and to thoroughly resolve the border affairs that have been unresolved for thousands of years. Hundreds of thousands of border compatriots who are mired in deep water and fire should be connected with the government and become true people of the Republic of China, which is in line with the principle of 'equality among all ethnic groups within the country' advocated by the National Father. We sincerely hope and request that compatriots across the country give us sympathy and strong assistance."

Among the 1.5 million border compatriots in Xikang, more than 500,000 people pay taxes and grain. The total number of Han and Tibetan people in Xikang is 1.7 million, but there is not a single Yi ethnic representative in the Xikang Provincial Assembly. They believe that this

unequal distribution

has a great responsibility for the backwardness of various constructions in border areas. At present, the problems in the mountainous areas are still the common and urgent problems of all areas awaiting development. Transportation, education, and hygiene all deserve our strengthened efforts.

The Yi area is not barren mountains and deserts, but a region with abundant resources and rich products. However, due to inconvenient transportation, not only can natural resources not be developed, but the surplus grains of Leibo, Mabian, and Pingwu were burned in the early days of the Anti-Japanese War due to excessive storage. Now, except for Xichang

which has air transport

, there is only one highway running through the Anning River Valley. The inconvenience of transportation leaves the goods of the Yi area abandoned on the ground, and the dry road with a station every ninety li further hinders the promotion of education. At present, there are three middle schools and nine elementary schools in the Yi area. Including both Yi and Han students, there are only more than 2,000 students. Public schools are difficult to develop due to their location, while schools run by chieftains and people's leaders have many difficult problems to solve. The Yi ethnic compatriots have a strong desire for knowledge, and all

are willing to learn Chinese

. However, they learn to speak first and then learn to read. This indirect learning method, coupled with the late age of enrollment (ten years old) and the unsuitability and lack of teaching materials and equipment, the education in the Yi area urgently needs external assistance. Similarly, health care work in the Yi area especially needs external assistance. An aspirin is a remarkable treasure, and the Yi compatriots still regard diseases as terrible as demons. At the close of the Far Eastern Education Research Conference in Shanghai, it is felt that the establishment of a living foundation for the Yi ethnic group is imminent.

Following the progress of the times, the Yi ethnic compatriots have received democratic education, and they

focus on reality

and issued a call: "Our petition is reasonable, and participating in politics and building the Yi area is our right and our obligation. We hope that this patriotic act of a small ethnic group can be understood, sympathized with, and supported by all." (Reporter Pu Dejie)

### Communist Bandits Flee to Anhui, Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders All Counties to Completely Suppress

[Reported from Zhenjiang by this newspaper] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang stated that the communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops had fled into the Dabie Mountains, invaded Jiang, Liu'an, Zhenshan, and Lihuang and other places, and disturbed Hefei. The provincial government again telegraphed all commissioners, county chiefs, and mayors that they must increase vigilance and make every effort to suppress the remaining bandits within the territory, strengthen and consolidate the border, and establish local security.

[Also reported] Communist bandits are rampant in Pizhou County. The newly编 Eighth Division of the Communist bandits, the 17th and 19th regiments, etc., with full equipment and led by bandit deputy division commander Su Peiyuan, captured the Tiefo Temple and Beifengchang area of the 7th District last month, and continued to invade southward, attacking Chahe Bridge Head in the 6th District, Yishulianfang Mountain Nanfengchang, etc. After the local teams bravely resisted, they were successively captured due to the disparity in strength, and they burned, killed, and looted with extremely cruel means. Dozens of people, including Dong Entan, were brutally killed, and property and livestock were swept away. The people could not bear it and fled one after another.

### Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang, and Jiading Counties Hold Suppression Meeting

### Yoshiko Kawashima, Her Cry is Sorrowful, Imprisoned for Two Years, Text Long at Two Thousand, Prison Atmosphere Leaps Off the Paper

[Reported from Beiping on the 17th by this newspaper] Jin Bihui (also known as Yoshiko Kawashima), who has been imprisoned for nearly two years without a verdict, has been working hard to learn Chinese and write articles in the women's prison education class. When she appeared in court yesterday to testify in the property dispute case of Min Lutongxuan, a resident of Tianjin, she took out an article entitled "My Two Years of Prison Life," intending to submit it to the reporter for publication in this newspaper. The article described the hardships of her prison life, and expressed her immense longing for "Little Monkey" (Xiao Fu), who used to be inseparable from her. She then appealed to people to treat well the monkey Xiao Fu, who had lost his master, saying in the article: "He is a smart and lovely little animal. He has not committed any crime, he will not betray the country. I am his little master, I dare to say this sentence." Finally, the writing turned to defending herself, saying: "Could it be said that I, the little master, am not as good as him? It's really a false accusation. I will never betray the country, I can't forget my motherland. Xiao Fu! Xiao Fu! Your master will never be a traitor"! The article is more than 2,000 characters long. The loneliness and suffering of prison life leaps off the paper. It can be said that "when a bird is about to die, its cry is sad." (Special correspondent Zhang Jianmei)

### Empty Big Stores Act as Guarantors, Fujian Grain Criminal Flees to Taiwan

[Reported from Fuzhou on the 15th by this newspaper] Lin Zi Pei, Deputy Director of the Land and Grain Office of Linsen County, was sentenced to four years in prison for corruption and dereliction of duty, as reported in this newspaper. The criminal was granted bail by the court due to illness, which aroused the attention of the government, the assembly, and public opinion in this area. The provincial government believed that the sudden bail of the criminal Lin would inevitably attract criticism, and had sent a letter to the court requesting a reply. The provincial, county, and municipal assemblies had dispatched assembly members to the court to question the bail process. The public opinion organs stated that the criminal Lin was flaunting his bail release and parading through the streets, showing no signs of illness. The court was suspected of favoritism and releasing him. The newspapers criticized it strongly. Regarding the bail process of the criminal Lin, it was learned that after the verdict, the prison guards submitted two signed documents stating that the criminal was seriously ill and should be released on bail. The handling judge ordered him to be brought to court for examination. The prison guards reported back to the judge that the criminal was too ill to move. Therefore, bail was granted. Before the bail, the criminal made careful arrangements, first having people open two empty stores in Nantai, claiming to have a capital of 2 billion yuan, to serve as his storefronts for bail. After being released on bail, he fled to Taiwan in a few days. From this, it can be seen that the rice weevil is cunning and the court is biased and perverting the law. Public opinion is in an uproar, and the court has not yet made any statement.

### Beiping Relief General Administration Colludes with Corrupt Criminals, Transferred to Beiping Court for Investigation

[Reported by Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th] Relief General Administration Jin Sui Cha Branch Commissioner Yu Baihua, Deputy Director of the Storage and Transportation Group and Director of the Beiping Warehouse Zheng Zuyin, and Director of the Beiping Customs Xiyuan Airport Office Shen Weishan, abused their powers and colluded in corruption. After being reported by Relief General Administration consultant Li Guanghe, the criminals were arrested successively in Beiping and have been transferred to the court for handling. Yu Baihua obtained the consent of Relief General Administration staff member An Dingyuan (Belgian priest from the Hongdong Diocese) and, under the guise of relief supplies from the Hongdong Diocese, used the Relief General Administration airlift team to transport 83 bales of cotton cloth from Beiping to Beiping three times from June 20 to 22. Yu transported 70 bales of cotton cloth from the Beiping Plains to Beiping at a freight rate of 50,000 yuan per kilogram. When picking up the goods in Beiping, it was discovered that 27 bales of cloth were not contracted for transportation, so he extorted 200 million yuan from the consignors. The consignors reported to Li Guanghe that Yu's transportation of cotton cloth in Beiping was known to Shen Zashan, director of the Customs Xiyuan Airport Office. Shen took the opportunity to coerce Zheng Zudi, director of the warehouse in charge of storage and transportation in Beiping Plains, to transport 27 bales of cotton cloth on his behalf. Zheng, fearing that the plot would be exposed, agreed to his request. Shen gave Zheng 30 million yuan from what he had obtained. The 56 bales of cloth that Yu transported in Beiping belonged to the Desiang family in Beiping, totaling 294,630,000 yuan. Before Yu obtained this money, he was discovered and monitored by the consultant. The 27 bales of cotton cloth handled by Shen Wei on behalf belonged to the Xie Xingzhi and other seven companies in Beiping. The freight rate was 40,000 yuan per kilogram, and Shen embezzled more than 100 million yuan. The stolen funds were the difference in freight rates. The airlift team transported relief supplies between Beiping and Beiping at only 1,953 yuan per kilogram.

[Reported from Taipei on the 13th by this newspaper] Taiwan has a lot of wood, but there is a timber shortage everywhere. The forestry administration and transportation should be responsible for this. Due to the difficulty in obtaining a supply of wood, the paper industry was the first to suffer. The Taipei Paper Mill of the Paper Industry Company was originally

### Bamboo Pulp Paper New Initiative, Taiwan Province Paper Industry Embarks on a Turning Point

It is the only wood pulp paper mill in our country, but now it has to explore alternative raw materials.

Taichung, Hsinchu, and Yilan areas are rich in Kuei bamboo. Under normal economic conditions, bamboo is more expensive than wood, but now the price of bamboo is one-third lower than wood, and wood is calculated by volume, while bamboo is calculated by weight. The production area of bamboo is low, and transportation is convenient. Under these many favorable conditions, the Japanese used to work hard to study and test it. The world's standard method for cooking bamboo uses soda (i.e., caustic soda), and the Japanese also invented the magnesium bisulfite method, but both of these methods cannot suit today's environment; one ton of caustic soda costs nearly 500,000 Taiwan dollars, and the caustic soda used to make one pound of paper is not even enough to buy half a pound of paper, and the paper is light yellow; the magnesium oxide required by the magnesium bisulfite method originally came from the Northeast, but now the communist bandits are harassing and it is impossible to obtain it, and the disadvantage of this method is that bleaching is difficult.

The Taipei Paper Mill used the original pulp making machine and calcium bisulfite liquid to try to cook bamboo material, and the quality of the bamboo pulp obtained was very poor. Later, the factory director Lin added a trace amount of alkaline substance to the medicine liquid and steamed it at 140 degrees Celsius for 12 hours, and discovered a few amazing achievements: 1. Bleaching is extremely easy, only 4% of effective chlorine is needed to bleach it to snow white. 2. Puling is rapid, and paper can be copied in two hours. 3. The paper quality is better than wood pulp paper. 4. The whiteness is higher than the soda method and the magnesium gasification method. 5. This method is still extremely effective in treating reeds and sugar cane residue. In this way, it can replace the magnesium gasification in the Northeast, and the medicinal materials are produced in this province, so it is not difficult to obtain them. Especially its economic value is worthy of praise, because Taiwan has even more inexhaustible raw materials - bamboo. In the past, bamboo could only provide Taiwanese with bamboo shoots and furniture!

In the midst of the paper shortage, this is a major turning point for the Taiwan paper industry. It is estimated that there is no problem in producing 40 to 50 tons of paper a day. The Taipei factory has planned to apply for a patent for this new initiative! (Reporter Yang Wenyu)

### Glass Sand, Produced in Southern Fujian Kinmen, Has Mining Value

[Reported from Fuzhou on the 15th by this newspaper] Kinmen County in Southern Fujian, an isolated island, is the gateway to Xiamen and is known for its abundant mineral resources.

Referring to the Ministry's promulgated measures for the qualification screening of graduates from colleges and universities in the recovered areas and the regulations for the organization of the teaching staff qualification screening committee, the "Organizational Regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Qualification Screening Committee for Graduates of Unregistered Private Colleges and Universities" will be formulated and implemented.

### Datong University Overcharges Students. The Student Union Hosted Reporters Yesterday to Report on Parents' Difficulties in Raising Funds.

[Our report] The Shanghai College and University Association determined that the total tuition and miscellaneous fees for private universities in the city this semester should not exceed 1.6 million yuan. At the meeting where Mayor Wu and others hosted donations to scholarships at the International Hotel on the 23rd of last month, President Zhu Jingnong of Guanghua University and former Director of the Education Bureau Gu Yuxiu publicly announced this, making it a final decision. It is reported that Datong University is currently violating the above resolution by overcharging, causing student dissatisfaction.

Yesterday at 3 p.m., the Datong University Student Union hosted reporters at Xiangxueyuan to report on the situation. The person in charge of the union reported on the school's fees with a low voice, seemingly unable to bear the grief and indignation. It is said that the tuition and miscellaneous fees for Datong University this semester, as announced by the school, are set at 1.8 million yuan, and together with the experiment fee of 1.04 million yuan, the total is as high as more than 2.8 million yuan. Most of the students' parents are salaried workers, and it is very common for families to have two or three children in school. After this war, who has enough savings to make ends meet? Moreover, commerce and industry have declined, and the price of rice and firewood is high. It is already difficult to raise 1.6 million yuan for tuition. Now, the school authorities have violated the regulations of the municipal authorities and unilaterally raised the amount to such an extent. The majority of students will be forced to drop out of school. They urgently appeal to the society for sympathy and report the following six requests to the school authorities: (1) The maximum tuition and miscellaneous fees should be 1.6 million yuan; (2) Fees should be paid in two installments, with half paid first; (3) Impoverished students should register for classes first and pay fees later; (4) Establish free quotas: 15% fully exempt, 10% half exempt; (5) Salaries for teachers and staff should also be paid in two installments; (6) Withdraw the order to "force students to transfer schools." Finally, the person in charge reported on the school's scholarship situation, stating: Datong University currently has 2,350 students, including new students (this is the number reported by President Hu of the school to the Shanghai Municipal Scholarship Unified Review Committee). The school has approved only 23 students with full tuition waivers, 20 students with three-quarters tuition waivers, 112 students with half waivers, and 30 students with one-quarter waivers, totaling 185 people equivalent to 102 full waivers. Adding the 9 students approved for scholarships by the alumni association, this accounts for 4.9% of the total number of students. According to government regulations, the full waiver quota for scholarships should account for 10% of the total number of students, that is, 235 students should be fully exempt, not including other free quotas.

[Another report] The union has submitted reports to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and the Shanghai Municipal Scholarship Unified Review Committee, reporting on the school's fees. Mayor Wu has also agreed to meet with representatives of the union within days to inquire about the situation.

### National Foreign Trade Conference Extended Session Concludes Today; President Zhang Sends Representative to Read Written Remarks

[Our Newspaper] The National Foreign Trade Conference was held at 10:00 AM yesterday on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. Over a hundred representatives attended, chaired by Shou Jingwei. First, he introduced the foreign guests present to the assembly. Then, he invited Mr. John Binham, director of the British Chamber of Commerce, to speak. He mainly said that since China's control of imports and exports, the difficulties faced in imports include: (1) After import restrictions, the import of raw materials and equipment has sharply decreased, making it difficult to maintain existing industries, and further slowing down industrialization. (2) The announcement of quotas was too sudden, making it impossible for the industry to adapt, causing various serious problems. The issuance of import licenses and foreign exchange application forms is too slow. The difficulties of the export industry are: (1) Chinese products cannot obtain foreign markets because prices and labor costs are too high. (2) China can only increase exports by developing agriculture. Major export products such as silk, tea, pig bristles, tung oil, fur, and soybeans, if selected for excellent varieties and long-term cultivation, improve quality, and establish international credit, all have hope for large exports. (3) China's main industrial raw material, cotton, should make every effort to increase production to be self-sufficient. Although cotton is not an export product, this move can greatly reduce the burden on foreign exchange. Mr. Hai finally expressed an optimistic view, saying that if China has a long-term plan, it will surely become a major production center. The Chinese are diligent and hardworking, so efforts to expand exports will surely be fruitful.

Yang Ge Advocates Rewarding Exports

Consultant of the Central Bank, Mr. Yang, was invited to give a speech. Mr. Yang advocated that China should have a concrete policy of rewarding exports. Measures that have been implemented and should be implemented are: (1) Abolish export taxes. (2) Rationalize the tax rate of domestic export goods. (3) The exchange rate should be kept reasonable so that local products can be exported in large quantities. (4) Explore the resources of Taiwan and the Northeast to make them a source of exports. Later, the Canadian Commercial Counselor, Mr. Goldstone, and the representative of the British-Iranian Oil Company, Mr. Gordon, were also invited to speak.

President Zhang Sends Representative to Speak

At this point, Pan Xulun arrived and represented the President of the Executive Yuan to give instructions. The main points were: (1) Welcome foreign businessmen to invest in China. The government is paying close attention to and remedying various factors that hinder foreign trade, such as high costs and hoarding. (2) Rice, wheat, and cotton are the source of food and clothing, and efforts should be made to increase production and not rely on foreign countries. Agriculture, industry, and commerce are closely related and should cooperate closely. (3) Commercial ethics should be quickly restored to develop foreign trade on a large scale.

Subsequently, Ge Jingzhong of China Silk Company, Wu Weijing of China Textile, Xi Changtong, manager of the International Department of the Bank of China, and Xin Jian, Zhang Xiaomei, and Fang Shanggui delivered speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned at noon.

Afternoon Discussion of Proposals from Various Groups

The conference continued at 2:00 PM to discuss the examination reports of the proposals from various groups. Multiple proposals from the Trade Policy Group, the Export Raw Materials Group, the Finance Group, the Consortium Group, the Barter Trade Group, and the Machinery Products Group were amended and passed. During the discussion, guest speakers gave speeches. Commercial Counselor of the United States, Mr. Kyle, gave a speech. After reviewing China's trade deficit, Mr. Kyle pointed out that imports have increased to 400 million US dollars, while exports are less than half. "Agriculture is the best friend of the export industry." If the burden on farmers can be reduced and farmers are encouraged to produce with reasonable purchase prices, the export volume will surely increase greatly. Silk fabrics, wool blankets, soybeans, vegetable oil, etc. can be exported in large quantities to earn foreign exchange. Ling Xianyang, President of Shanghai University, said that to develop China's foreign trade, attention must be paid to the following two things: (1) Increase farmers' purchasing power, improve farmers' lives, and increase agricultural production. (2) Restore China's original commercial ethics. Miao Yuntai, a member of the National Economic Council, delivered a speech, agreeing with Ling Xian's proposition, saying that "agriculture produces, industry completes, and commerce manages." The three industries are closely related and should cooperate closely. The discussion lasted until 4:30 PM. Due to heated debates, there were still many proposals that had not been discussed. It was decided to extend the meeting for one day. The conference also passed the temporary motions of Chu Zhucheng and Luo Qinghua, telegraphing Foreign Minister Wang to insist on the veto power of the four major powers.

### Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Rise Again

Recently, because there was no more Brazilian white round rice available, Brazilian brown rice has been changed to be processed and distributed. Although this rice also comes from Brazil, it is longer in shape and slightly different from round rice, but it tastes quite good.

### Free Trading of Flour Trial Begins on the 18th

Regarding the issue of restoring free trade of flour, the Materials Advisory Committee of the China Trust Bureau convened a meeting of major manufacturers and flour and bran industry trade associations at 4:00 PM on the 17th and decided to temporarily start a trial on the 18th. It is reported that the reason for the cancellation of the mandatory low-price dumping is roughly the same as that of edible oil. In order to prevent the backflow of flour, arbitrage by merchants, and encourage production, it is necessary to temporarily restore free trade. In order to be cautious, the Association also instructed that the factory's free price should be based on the following three principles: (1) Inventory on hand, (2) Current market price, (3) Future replenishment.

It is also learned that the tax standard for the redemption and interest payment of various bonds was originally stipulated to be based on the date of payment of the principal and interest of the bonds. From June of this year, it has been temporarily changed to a tax rate of 5 percent. The meaning is that regardless of the maturity of the coupons, they will be collected at 5 percent in order to simplify the procedures and facilitate calculation.

### Rayon Slightly Weak

The rayon market was extremely weak yesterday morning because web manufacturers stopped doing business due to the excessively high price. The opening was small. No. 120 Takayama Yukou first shouted 32.5 million yuan, but no one asked, and continued to fall. The minimum price at noon closing was 2.1 million yuan, and Dongyang was 2.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the fact that actual sales customers took advantage of the price drop and had a slight appetite for imports, the market rebounded again. The final price rose to 3 million yuan again, and Dongyang 3.5 million yuan. As a result, it fell by 300,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The factory's business was flat and soft yesterday. Because the prices had risen too much for several days, buyers were watching, and the transaction was very small. The shouting prices of all levels remained unchanged. The cotton goods market was slightly weak yesterday.

### "Special Issue on Fundamental Education"

— Oriental Stone

Published by the Research Department of the National College of Social Education

"Education and Society" Volume 6, Issues 2 and 3

There are very few regular publications on social education academics in China, and the quarterly "Education and Society" compiled by the National College of Social Education has always been known as the torch of the social education community. In order to cooperate with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Chinese government to jointly convene the Far East Regional Conference on Basic Education Research in Nanjing, a "Special Issue on Basic Education" was specially compiled in the second and third issues of Volume 6 of the publication, which was published on September 1.

The term "fundamental education" cannot be regarded as novel in China's education community. Because the purpose of "fundamental education" as stipulated by the United Nations organization is: "To eliminate illiteracy, promote primary education in relatively backward countries, and promote mass education." In the course of advocating new education in China for decades, there have already been the promotion of various education undertakings such as civil education, compulsory education, mass education, and social education, the nature and meaning of which are roughly the same as "fundamental education"; Since the implementation of national education in the 29th year of the Republic of China, children's education has been merged with mass education and social education, so that people can cultivate their national consciousness, production skills, and common sense of science and hygiene in addition to literacy, which is enough to show that "fundamental education" in China has already had a positive move; When the United Nations organization held its first conference in Paris in November 1946, it decided to hold the first regional research meeting on fundamental education in the capital of China - Nanjing, also because it believed that China was a pioneer in the promotion of modern education. However, China is a large country with poor people, and with the natural disasters and human errors of the past hundred years, the cycle continues endlessly. Although Mr. Sun Yat-sen guided the national revolution and strived to improve the people's lives, even today, more than half of the people are still inevitably struggling in the plight of poverty, weakness, ignorance, and selfishness, spending their pitiful lives. Therefore, in today's research and discussion of "fundamental education", whether it is the "new trend of world education" of the present era, or "it already exists in China", it is still an important matter worthy of national attention.

The first article in the column, "My Beliefs in Basic Education" by Chen Lijiang, shows the role of education and culture as a reflection of the economic system in a very profound and clear way. And hoping that the power of fundamental education will enable the people of all countries to be trained into pure world citizens and create new educational philosophical concepts is indeed an accurate and unchanging theory. Next, Mr. Zhang Zhian's "Social Education and World Peace" put forward the path of educational transformation based on the principle of building world peace, which is indeed a fierce awakening that is worthy of people around the world to re-evaluate the value of education.

China promotes civil education, compulsory education, social education, and national education, and even immediately strives for the fundamental education marked out this time. I am afraid that it will still inevitably repeat the mistakes of the past few decades - the culture has been swept away as it is eliminated, and Zhizhi will always maintain a long distance from the progress of atomic research. The reason for this lies entirely in the restrictions of politics and economy. This point is singled out, and Mr. Gu Mei's "Basic Problems of Basic Education" does have its unique insights. What is regrettable is that in today's post-robbery mountains and rivers, which are riddled with holes, these so-called basic problems are probably still not easy to solve!

All countries and ethnic groups in the world have different social conditions and historical backgrounds. China has been rooted in the traditional living habits of the nation for thousands of years due to feudal consciousness; and because Qing Dynasty didn't fix it, it became the target of encirclement and attack by the powers and fell into the misfortune of being a sub-colony, causing the people to fall outside the political circle; To this day, it is still a country without science, without construction, or even without production tools and production technology. People's lives are always struggling on the edge of the death line. Under such circumstances, should the promotion of fundamental education have special emphasis and start? Mr. Dong Weichuan's article "The Unique Significance of Fundamental Education in China" not only lists the crux of the matter without any scruples, but also clearly indicates the path that China must take to promote fundamental education.

Mr. Shu Xincheng has made many contributions to the construction of China's cultural undertakings; Wang Weizhi's Light Born has been hosting the Radio and Television Department of Shejiao College with his unremitting work and hard-working creative perseverance. Now, the magazine contains two articles, "The Plan for Promoting Electrified Education in Basic Education" by Shu and "The Theory of Literacy Education Films and Our Production" by Wang. Both articles have a definite assessment of the use of new tools of fundamental education - sensory aids, including film and broadcast, - in education. The former formulates a detailed plan based on China's actual environment, and the latter creates something with the spirit of research and experimentation, which can be used for reference and adoption when promoting basic education.

The two work reports of the National Education Experimental Zone and the Social Education Experimental Zone of the college can not only be used as explanations when receiving representatives to the Basic Education Conference for visits, but also for general reference when implementing basic education. Mr. Gu Yuezhong's "A Bird's-Eye View of Fundamental Education in Various Countries After the War" also has something that can be borrowed from China.

### How to be a Little Teacher

— Gao Ning

(Written by Tao Xingzhi, published by Commercial Press, 35 pages in the book, priced at 1500 yuan.)

Educational theorist Tao Xingzhi's pioneerization, regardless of his beliefs, still has merit for China's education community. Mr. Zhu Jingzhi was a friend of his life, and as far as the reporter knows, he also highly admired his educational theories.

When Tao taught poor children, he adopted the little teacher system. This book "How to be a Little Teacher" is the guidance method for being a little teacher - the implementation plan of new education.

The content of this book includes: (1) Why be a little teacher, (2) Find students, (2) Do you need a textbook? (4) Literacy or reading? (5) Activity materials, (6) Gramophone and radio, (7) The function of the map, (8) Know what to teach, (9) The time to teach people, (10) Don't put on airs, (11) Be humble in learning, (12) Teach your students to be little teachers too, (13) Little Teacher Corps, (14) One becomes two, (15) Pin your students down, and let your students pin you down.

These fifteen steps are the necessary steps to be a little teacher. In today's China, where education is not universal, the little teacher system can at least be used as a reference for eliminating illiteracy. I believe that this can solve many problems in popularizing education.

When everyone is discussing how to promote fundamental education, we put forward this book as a work and book for developing teaching.

I hope that every young friend will read this book, and then carefully implement the task of popularizing education, then the happiness of the Chinese people will be endless.

### Chinese Stereoscopic Topographic Map

—

(Historical Geography Chart Compilation Society)

(Published by Yaguang Cartography Society)

(First Edition, June of the Thirty-Sixth Year)

I am now introducing to readers a stereoscopic topographic map. In the past, the mapping of topographic maps of our country was all two-dimensional. Although two-dimensional topographic maps can also indicate the high and low terrain, they still cannot provide map readers with a thorough understanding of the national terrain. Therefore, stereoscopic topographic maps were created.

As far as I know, there are currently two types of stereoscopic topographic maps published in our country: The first type is the stereoscopic topographic map of the "New Provincial Maps of China" compiled by Mr. Weng Wenhao, Mr. Ding Wenjiang, and Mr. Zeng Shiying, published by the Shenbao Newspaper. Its vertical scale is about fifteen times the two-dimensional scale. The second type is the "Great China Stereoscopic Topographic Map" edited by the Historical Geography Chart Compilation Society, published by the Yaguang Cartography Society, with a scale of 1:6,300,000.

The "New Provincial Maps of China" published by Shenbao Newspaper took the lead; as for the "Great China Stereoscopic Topographic Map," its larger map size is convenient for hanging, which may be its advantage.

The political regions of the Nine Northeastern Provinces have recently been re-divided. The re-division of the Nine Northeastern Provinces is presumably what map readers are eager to know. This map has been redrawn based on the boundaries announced by the National Government.

The lower corner of this map contains a general description of the map, clearly presenting the topographic features of the entire country. It divides the national terrain into four major parts, each further divided into several sub-regions: (1) Tibetan Plateau, (2) Mongolian-Xinjiang Plateau, (3) Adjacent areas of the Great Plateau, further divided into five regions: Hinggan Mountains, Shanxi-Shaanxi Plateau, Central Mountains, Sichuan Basin, and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. (4) Low hills and plains, further divided into nine regions: Northeast Plain, Changbai Hills, North China Plain, Shandong Hills, Yangtze Plain, Jiangnan Hills, Southeast Hills, Basins, and Taiwan and Hainan Island.

This map was carefully planned by the editors, but it is unavoidable that there are still omissions. Now, based on my limited observations, there are approximately two points:

First, the Xukong, Yunnan-Burma, Jijiang, Chengdu, Hainan Island, Kaifeng small railroads, and other railroads were not indicated.

Second, the provincial boundaries at the junction of Sichuan and Yunnan are missing. (Written by Wang Bangzhen, published by Commercial Press)

### Modern Geometry (Written by Wang Bangzhen, Published by Commercial Press)

— Xiao Chengji

Geometry, as a discipline, was highly developed in ancient Greece, but after the fifth century, there was no significant progress. It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that modern geometry flourished, and many ingenious and beautiful theorems emerged one after another. Like exotic flowers blooming profusely, it was the height of its glory. Many middle school students are very interested in this, but they often suffer from not being able to obtain suitable books for research. Although there are only a few books on modern geometry in China, most of them are not suitable for the level and interest of Chinese students. Since I saw Mr. Wang Bangzhen's book, I felt like I had discovered an oasis in the desert!

This book strives for simple explanations. Anyone who has completed a basic geometry course can continue reading. The entire book is divided into eleven chapters: 1. Barycenter, 2. Triangle, 3. Concurrency and Collinearity, 4. Harmonic Division, 5. Pole and Polar, 6. Center of Similarity, 7. Coaxial Circles and Orthogonal Circles, 8. Inversion, 9. Cross Ratio, 10. Principle of Duality, 11. Recent Triangle Geometry. In just over one hundred and sixty pages, the entire content of modern geometry is concisely presented, allowing readers to gain a complete and clear overview with minimal effort. After reading this book, when you read other more advanced geometry books, you can handle them with ease and without any difficulty.

This book is based on Godfrey & Siddous’ “Modern Geometry.” The original book by these two authors is extremely popular in England, and Mr. Wang Bangzhen’s book has even surpassed the former in some aspects: he has collected many famous problems (such as Talbot's Theorem and Malfatti's Problem), which are very wonderful and not found in general books.

In addition, the figures in the book are also very exquisite, unlike generally poorly printed books that make people lose their appetite at first sight.

For those who are already very interested in geometry but cannot find suitable books, I would like to solemnly recommend this book to them.

### Special Publication on Basic Education

The third issue of "New Education Magazine" publishes a special issue on basic education, containing articles such as Zhu Yaokui's "The Path of Basic Education," Ding Shi's "Activity is Education," Qu Junong's "Adult Education," Li Jixian's "A System of Educational Activities in National Schools," Zhao Buxia's "The Rural Construction Experiment of the Chinese People's Education Association," Yan Yangchu's "Problems of Rural Education in China," Hui Nong's "How I Teach Natural Science," Pearl S. Buck's "How to Educate People," and more than thirty other articles. Publication address: No. 3, Shuangjing Road, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu.

### History of the Hongmen

— Edited by Lu Danlin and Zhu Lin, published by Zhonghua Book Company

Paperback, 32mo, one volume, price: 4 yuan

The organization of secret societies has always been secretive. Their members must strictly keep the contents of the organization secret. If any member leaks information to the outside world, they will be subject to the most severe punishment (the fifth prohibition in the Ten Prohibitions states: "After joining the Hongmen, members must not privately share the society's regulations with outsiders; those who violate this will be executed." The sixth of the Twenty-One Rules states: "Those who privately show ritual books and membership certificates to outsiders will have their ears cut off and receive one hundred and eight strokes of the cane." The eighth rule states: "Those who report society matters to outsiders will have their ears cut off and receive seventy-two strokes of the cane."). Therefore, they all strictly maintain secrecy. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Commercial Press published "The History of Chinese Secret Societies" by Hirayama Zhou, which combined the Bailian Society, the Tiandihui, the Sanhehui, the Gelaohui, the Xingzhonghui, the Guangfu Gonghui, etc. into a book. Although his materials were incomplete, the contents of secret societies, which had always been regarded as secret, were made public for the first time. In the twenty-fourth year, the "Historical Materials of Modern Secret Societies" edited and printed by Xiao Yushan had more pictures and texts, and the content was also more abundant. Last year, Master Wei Da wrote "Chinese Gangs," which was also written in great detail. There are also several other books about gangs, but the content is largely the same.

Zhu Lin's "History of the Hongmen" focuses on the content of the Hongmen, especially the materials on secret language, code words, common slang, membership procedures, various examinations, mountain opening ceremonies, altar order, commands, and classified regulations, which are relatively detailed. It enables people who study the various rituals and secret language of the Hongmen to understand them in detail. Moreover, from those commands, one can understand their thoughts. This is practical material for studying secret societies. At the same time, it reflects the deep intentions behind their compilation of these commands and secret language, which is a unique perspective that transcends the thinking and actions of general scholar-officials at the time.

However, the book has a major shortcoming, that is, in citing materials about the revolutionary movement of the Xingzhonghui and its relationship with the Hongmen, the author seems to be very unfamiliar with the history of the Kuomintang. For example, he said that the National Father "lived in Java, in the Nanyang, and was a Christian." This is contrary to the facts. There is no basis for the so-called living in Java. Even being a Christian was started by the National Father, and the National Father's elder brother, De Zhang, was also not a Christian. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the National Father began to reorganize the Zhi Gong Tang in San Francisco and revise its constitution. However, the author of this book said that he "met the leader of the Sanhehui, Zheng Shiliang, in Honolulu, who introduced him to join the society, reorganized the Zhi Gong Tang, and founded the Xingzhonghui... and then sent members Zheng Bichen, Lu Haodong, Chen Shaobai, Chen Zonggui, Yang Feihong... and others to various places to unite comrades and visit heroes..." This is contrary to the facts. Zheng Shiliang was the National Father’s classmate when he studied medicine at the Boji Hospital in Guangzhou. Bichen was Shiliang's alias. Yang Feihong (Hong) was Yang Quyun, who met the National Father in Hong Kong. Lu Haoche died for his country as early as the twenty-first year of Guangxu (1895), and Yang Quyun was also assassinated by Qing officials' spies in Hong Kong after the Huizhou Uprising in the twenty-sixth year of Guangxu (1900). How could they participate in the work of reorganizing the Zhi Gong Tang eight years before the Republic of China? Moreover, Zheng Bichen, Lu Haodong, Yang Quyun, and others had never been to Honolulu. The Xingzhonghui's first uprising was in the twenty-first year of Guangxu (1895), and the location was Guangzhou, not Huizhou. Those who died in this uprising were Lu Haodong, Zhu Guiquan, and Qiu Si, among others. Cheng Yaochen was arrested and died in the Dayou Cang. More than sixty others who were arrested were all labeled as foolish people who were misled and were dispersed separately. However, the author of this book said that members Chen Zonggui, Li Yaju, Yang Feihong, You Xiangshan, etc. died for their country. I don't know what the basis is. (Note: Lu Haodong's name is Zhonggui, but the author of this book says it is Chen Zonggui. I don't know if it's one person or two.)

Regarding the Xingzhonghui's constitution, it does not use the constitution of the initial organization in Honolulu, but uses the Hong Kong Xingzhonghui constitution, and it is not noted why? The key resolutions and clauses of the new constitution revised by the Zhi Gong Tang in San Francisco are important documents after the reorganization of the Zhi Gong Tang and were drafted by the National Father himself. The author of this book omitted it and did not include it, which is a bit of a pity.

If this book can rewrite and add the historical facts of the combination of the Xingzhonghui, the Tongmenghui, and the Hongmen, the predecessors of the Kuomintang, it would be a more detailed and精详 historical material on the History of the Hongmen. I would like to bring this up specifically, hoping that the author and readers of this book will pay attention to it and know the errors and omissions in this book.

### Miss Qingxia's Fund for the Poor, Widowed, and Sick: Mr. Jinhua Feng Generously Donates 5 Million Yuan. This Column Respectfully Expresses Our Respects on Behalf of Numerous Suffering Compatriots.

Yesterday, we received a letter from reader Mr. Jinhua Sheng, along with 5 million yuan in legal tender. He said in his letter: "Your newspaper's Qingxia Relief Association is benefiting the poor and sick, which is truly significant. I serve in the business world and cannot be called wealthy, but I can still live a warm and full life. Seeing countless suffering compatriots, how can I sit idly by? I am willing to donate all of the 5 million yuan I have saved to the Qingxia Relief Association to help suffering compatriots. I hope you will accept it." We express our heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Jin's righteous act, and we also congratulate the countless compatriots who are struggling in difficult circumstances. The Qingxia Relief Association has been awarded fifteen times from last year to now. Due to changes in currency values, the amount issued has increased each time, and the number of applicants has also gradually increased. Therefore, many people feel disappointed each time. Of course, we also have unspeakable difficulties. We hope that enthusiastic people will give us more continuous assistance.

### Kunshan Residents in Shanghai Establish Scholarship Fund

The Kunshan Residents in Shanghai Association, recognizing the difficulty for poor students from their hometown to pursue education, has specially set up 20 scholarships. Any student from Kunshan residing in Shanghai who is studying at a high school or above and whose family is poor and has excellent grades can apply to the association for assistance. Application forms and regulations can be obtained from the association's office at No. 346, Yongjia Road, Shanghai.

### Letter to the Editor: Questioning Zhabei Water and Electricity Company

To the Honorable Editors: We, the residents of No. 4 Da Li, Shanyin Road, North Sichuan Road, live together with relatives in one house. Since the summer, the water pressure of tap water in each household in the area has been insufficient. On weekdays, after 6:00 AM, the third-floor faucets do not drip water at all. By 7:00 AM, the second floor also has no water, and only the first floor has water. At noon, water only trickles out. It is not until 11:00 PM or 12:00 AM that the second floor gradually has water, and the third floor must wait until 1:00 or 2:00 AM after midnight to have water. Daily water use must be carried up, which is extremely difficult! However, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's water and electricity charges are more expensive than those of the British-owned water and electricity company. Now, we see reports that prices will rise again. What is the reason? Such public utilities only know about money and do not care about morals. Not only do they not seek improvement, but they are also regressing day by day. For the sake of the public interest, the government should take them over and run them publicly. Otherwise, they must be severely warned not to raise prices in order to protect the rights and interests of citizens. We have always admired your newspaper for upholding justice. We hope that you will publish an abstract to make public opinion known. Sincerely, Zhang Qiqu, Qu Goupei, and Ji Yifei, residents of No. 21, No. 4 Da Li, September 16th.

The two edges of the armholes are inlaid with lace, maintaining the balance of the entire garment. The folds at the waist further accentuate the slender waist, resembling willow branches. As a result, the hem expands, ethereal and enchanting, with a captivating charm. Using white and red straight stripes creates a striking and eye-catching effect. Whether worn over a shirt or a cheongsam, it is the ideal outerwear for young women!

Wang Danfeng's Woolen Thread New Outfit

### The Relationship Between Woolen Thread and Knitting

— Feng Qiuping

Woolen thread was initially imported from Europe and the West. Because of its ability to innovate and bring forth new ideas, the Chinese people universally enjoy using it.

Recognizing the enormous outflow of wealth over the years, the Chinese people, in order to reclaim rights and benefits, created and sold domestic products to compete with imported goods. They invested heavily, established factories on their own, and spared no effort to concentrate the three major principles of financial resources, material resources, and human resources. Through diligent operation and striving for perfection, they have reached the present day, standing tall as the leading woolen thread industry in the world. This success is not accidental.

At that time, the art of knitting was still moving at a snail's pace, stuck in its old ways. This humble author, recognizing the growing need for knitted products, advocated tirelessly, founded knitting schools to select new talents, edited knitting books, or taught in the air, disclosing knowledge to people and providing it to enthusiasts. For more than ten years, I have worked diligently and have been deeply loved by ladies in society, for which I am truly ashamed. The number of graduates from all sessions is no less than a thousand, almost all over Shanghai. This is naturally due to the Chinese people's foresight in loving and using domestic goods. The relationship between knitting and woolen thread seems to be mutually related, with different tunes but the same melody. The focus is on this.

In recent years, the art of knitting has been changing with each passing day, catering to the times. Everything from women's fashion coats and cheongsams to children's clothing is widely selected. Therefore, domestic woolen thread is also selling well throughout the country, with supply falling short of demand. This must be attributed to the development of the art of knitting.

And the art of knitting is constantly improving. At this time of national mobilization, saving woolen thread is essential and meets the requirements of frugality. Therefore, the future path is truly unlimited.
