### The National Economic Commission Passes Draft: Officials and Citizens to Practice Thrift; Economic Control Measures Submitted for Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The draft of measures for practicing thrift and reducing consumption was passed by the National Economic Commission on the 17th.

Economic Reform Plan to be Submitted to the Government

Today's meeting was chaired by President Zhang. The main cases discussed are recorded as follows: (1) Regarding the Economic Reform Plan, it was resolved to task the Comprehensive Sub-Group with completing the sorting work within this week, submitting it to the general meeting next Monday for submission to the Executive Yuan, and then to the State Council. (2) Regarding the originally planned Urban Economic Control Measures, most committee members believed during the discussion that these measures were largely similar to the economic emergency measures and did not need to be formulated separately. Some also believed that they could be supplemented. It was resolved to submit them to the Ministry of Finance and other departments for review, selecting the more innovative ones, but the name will be changed. (3) The Draft Outline for Practicing Thrift and Reducing Consumption was revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan. (4) The Food Production Increase Plan submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture was submitted to Zuo Shunsheng, Weng Wenhao, and others for review. (5) The Principle of the Regulations on the Repayment of Pre-War Deposits and Loans by the Banking Industry was passed and sent to the Executive Yuan. (6) The Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Adjustment Measures, restoring the wartime cotton, yarn, and cloth control measures, using cotton to exchange for yarn, and yarn to exchange for cloth, to be handled by the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee without establishing another institution. That case...

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The 348th board meeting of the Four Joint Offices was held at 9:00 AM on the 17th, presided over by Vice Chairman Zhang Qun. Board members Yu Hongjun, Chen Guofu, Chen Qitian, Xu Kan, and Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan, among others, attended. In addition to approving over one hundred loan cases, the office, in view of the government's implementation of general mobilization, stipulated six items of "Principles for Coordinating the Implementation of Business Affairs of National Banks and Bureaus with General Mobilization," requiring that all banks and bureaus should expedite the absorption of idle funds, control of credit, assistance to production, facilitation of transport and marketing, and adjustment of branch institutions and tight expenditure in the future. After detailed discussion by the board members, the chairman appointed Yu Hongjun, Chen Guofu, Zhang Jia'ao, Xu Kan, and Xu Baiyuan to review them, and attached a proposed implementation plan. (Note: The section on the tea purchasing deadline from the Four Joint Offices meeting can be found on page 6.)

Repayment of Pre-War Deposits Principle Already Passed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The Regulations on the Repayment of Pre-War Deposits and Loans by the Banking Industry, which has attracted attention from all parties, was principally approved by the National Economic Commission on the 17th and will be sent to the Executive Yuan. Because it concerns the interests of the people, it may be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. The explanation of "pre-war" in the regulations is "before the declaration of war against Japan on December 9, 1941." There are two reasons for this interpretation: (1) China formally declared war against Japan on this day, (2) Prices were relatively stable before this date. It is heard that the principal and interest of deposits made from July 7, 1937, to September 3, 1945, until September 2, 1947, are as follows (the annual interest rate is calculated at the monthly interest rate compounded monthly): July 7 to December 31, 1937 (925.164), 1938 (858.714), 1939 (740.667), 1940 (620.951), 1941 (493.666), 1942 (366.639), 1943 (237.079), 1944 (112.414), January 1, 1945 onwards (46.661), September 3, 1945 onwards (20.358). However, the above is only a principle, and the calculation will be based on the date of promulgation of the law in the future.

### Increase Food Production Outline Drafted

Zuo Shunsheng Submitted to the National Economic Commission

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] In order to increase food production, enrich military supplies and civilian food, and reduce food imports, especially focusing on food supply in food-deficient cities, aiming to achieve self-sufficiency in the third year, Minister of Agriculture Zuo Shunsheng submitted to the National Economic Commission a "Draft Outline for a Food Production Increase Plan." The plan is divided into nine major categories. The work target is to increase rice by 20 million dan, wheat by 12 million dan, corn by 5 million dan, sorghum by 1.5 million dan, millet by 5.6 million dan, sweet potatoes by 4.1 million dan, potatoes by 2.7 million dan, soybeans by 2.5 million dan, and vegetables by 5 million dan by the end of the third year. The estimated cost until the end of 1947 is approximately 40 billion yuan for start-up costs and business expenses, with approximately 10 billion yuan needed for next year. In the plan, he pointed out that food-deficient areas are mostly densely populated areas and large cities, including: (1) Jinghu [Nanjing-Shanghai], (2) Hangyong [Hangzhou-Ningbo], (3) Rongshan [Fuzhou-Shantou], (4) Sui [Guangzhou], (5) Pingjin [Beijing-Tianjin], (6) Jiaoji [Jiaozhou-Jinan] six locations. Possible food supply areas include: (1) Su-Zhe-Wan [Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui], (2) Xiang-E-Gan [Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi], (3) Min-Tai [Fujian-Taiwan], (4) Chuan [Sichuan], (5) Liangyue [Guangdong-Guangxi], (6) Yu-Shaan-Ning [Henan-Shaanxi-Ningxia], (7) Ji-Lu-Sui [Hebei-Shandong-Suiyuan], (8) Liao-Ji [Liaoning-Jilin] eight locations. Production increase work should be carried out separately in each production and supply area. Central strongholds should be selected in each area to establish supervision institutions, and subsidiary strongholds should be designated according to the distribution of various food crops in the area to establish work institutions. Work items are divided into (1) exchanging for improved varieties, (2) applying fertilizer, (3) improving cultivation methods, (4) preventing and controlling diseases and pests, (5) increasing acreage, (6) improving storage, transportation, and processing. The case was slightly discussed at the meeting and handed over to Zuo Shunsheng, Weng Wenhao, and Wang Yunwu for review, to be discussed at the next general meeting.

### Chairman's Handwritten Instruction to the Ministry of Agriculture to Launch a Comprehensive Afforestation Campaign

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] It is learned that Chairman Chiang recently instructed the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in his own handwriting, stating that the outskirts of Nanjing, the Western Hills of Beiping, and Mount Song in Henan should be used as afforestation demonstration areas, launching a ten-year comprehensive afforestation campaign, to be completed within ten years from 1947, and allocated 600 million yuan for afforestation expenses, hoping that after ten years, all mountains will have trees and all trees will provide shade.

### All Groups Participating in the Election Should First Report a List of Names

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The organization of people's groups in various places has been proceeding very rapidly recently, and some people think this has something to do with occupational elections. On the 16th, our reporter paid a special visit to Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang to inquire whether there were any regulations regarding the deadline for the establishment of occupational groups participating in the election. He replied: Guiding the organization of people's groups is a routine task of the Ministry. All applications to initiate the organization of groups in accordance with the law can be approved for establishment at any time. As for occupational groups and women's groups participating in the election, according to Article 9, Paragraph 3 of the Enforcement Regulations for the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives and Article 9, Paragraph 3 of the Enforcement Regulations for the Election and Recall of Legislative Yuan Members, a list of names should be reported 90 days before the election. Therefore, all groups legally established before the 90-day deadline for this year's general election should report their lists and enjoy the right to vote. Those established after this deadline cannot participate in the election, but this does not affect the progress of their group organization.

### Bevin Delivers Speech Focuses on the Situation in the Far East

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 17th Broadcast: Bevin delivered a speech to British transport workers today. He stated that although the Far East is extremely remote from Britain, its current potential crisis for Britain is no smaller than that of Europe. He deeply hopes that the British people will not neglect the Far East. Bevin also said: "Some people point out that I have divided Europe into two, and say that Britain's acceptance of the Marshall Plan is tantamount to creating a second Munich. These statements are all inaccurate. In the past two years, I have been working continuously to prevent the division of Europe. The United States has made great contributions to victory, and I believe that the United States should use its enormous production capacity to work for peace. Britain's acceptance of the Marshall Plan will definitely not make it a vassal of the United States." Finally, Bevin, in a very somber tone, emphasized every word, saying: "The whole world has tasted the pain of war. Neither we, the United States, France, nor the Soviet Union need another war. But we must proceed cautiously, otherwise it is unimaginable. I will never identify a certain country as a possible enemy and implement policies based on this assumption. What I value is not the atomic bomb, but the lasting peace of Europe and the whole world."

The total output in June was 430,000 tons, and the daily output has reached over 15,000 tons since July.

### Two-Thirds of Railways in South China Recovered

The American Writer's Claims Are Not True

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] Recently, some American writers have claimed that although there are no Communist bandits in South China, the Chinese government has not taken any action to repair the railways in the area. This statement is absolutely not true. According to information from the Ministry of Communications released by Director of the News Bureau Dong XianGuang, the situation of railway repair in South China is as follows: During the Anti-Japanese War, the railway lines in South China were most thoroughly destroyed due to changes in the military situation. Currently, of the original 3,507 kilometers of railways in South China, 2,227 kilometers have been repaired and opened to traffic, about two-thirds.

### Rebuilding the National Assembly Hall Requires Over 20 Billion; the Executive Yuan Is Considering It Carefully

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The overall cost of the reconstruction project of the National Assembly Hall, jointly estimated by the General Political Department, the Construction Department of the Ministry of Interior, and the Fu Ji Construction Company, based on both reconstruction and new construction projects, is approximately as follows: (1) The reconstruction part, demolishing the rear of the original hall and increasing the number of seats, would cost approximately 21.49112 billion National Currency and require 150 working days. (2) The new construction part, based on the draft of the Construction Department of the Ministry of Interior, is estimated to cost approximately 22.3553875 billion National Currency (if some boilers are delayed and the chairs are changed to gauze fabric, it can be reduced by 6.96 billion National Currency) and requires approximately 180 working days. Furthermore, it is heard that an additional three months are needed for drawing. The above plans are all to accommodate the existing hall for reconstruction. According to people in charge of the project, if the existing hall is extended backward towards the pond, the soil firmness and slackness in front and back would be too different, and the entire structure would not be balanced, and there would be a place of collapse, and the number of seats added after the expansion would still be 200 seats short of what is needed, and the back row seats would be too far from the podium. This point should be noted. The above project and funding issues are all being carefully considered by the Executive Yuan.

### If the Korean Problem Is Resolved, the Situation in China Can Be Clarified; An Authoritative Figure Discusses Wedemeyer's Mission

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] An authoritative figure said that General Wedemeyer's visit to the Far East and Korea is one of his major objectives. Some people have incorrectly assumed that the US is inappropriately comparing our country, a major victorious power, with Korea, which is under Allied control. In fact, the current situation in Korea is far worse than in our country. For 20 months, Korea has been the direct point of contention between US and Soviet policy, with sharp conflicts occurring at any time. Therefore, the United States attaches great importance to it. Moreover, from our country's point of view, if the Korean problem can be resolved, the Chinese problem will naturally be solved. In international relations, the key to the problem lies in the situation and the facts. We should not ignore it because of the status of the nation.

The Current Situation in Korea Koreans Express Deep Indignation

[Another Cable] Our reporter visited Pu Chun, head of the Korean Provisional Government's delegation in China, on the 17th. He said that the delegation is drafting a memorandum with information on Korea's recent situation, to be submitted to General Wedemeyer. He said that nearly two years after Japan's surrender, Korea's situation is getting worse and worse. In the north, Korean Communists, under the protection of the Soviet army, are becoming more and more powerful. Wealth is destroyed, and people are struggling to survive. In the south, prices are soaring, the number of refugees is increasing, and bureaucrats from financial groups and compradors are colluding. In addition, Korean Communists are infiltrating and engaging in activities. Politics is lacking in achievements, and society lacks stability. The Korean people are deeply indignant about their innocent fate being sacrificed in the conflict between the US and the Soviet Union. He emphasized that if a thorough peace negotiation is not achieved between the US and the Soviet Union, the establishment of a coalition government will turn South Korea into a second North Korea, and 300,000 armed Korean Communists will encompass the Korean peninsula, endangering the entire Far East peace. This is the unanimous view of Korean revolutionary democrats, and it is hoped that General Wedemeyer's party will value the suffering of the Korean people and change the US Far East policy.

### Wedemeyer's Mission in China Is Purely to Assist the Government

Washington Figure Speaks

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th] According to well-informed sources, although General Wedemeyer is similar to Marshal Marshall's special envoy to President Truman last year, his mission is completely different from Marshal Marshall's. Marshal Marshall's mission was to find a way to mediate the domestic conflict in that country, while General Wedemeyer's purpose is to provide the Chinese government with all possible assistance from the United States to oppose the Communist Party. The US assistance to China will likely consist of supplying China with military equipment and ammunition, and the $500 million loan that the Export-Import Bank has allocated but not released may also be loaned to China. The terms of the loan are likely to be the same as those for the loan to Greece, because the domestic situations in China and Greece are quite similar. As for General Wedemeyer's visit to Korea, he also has an important mission to decide whether the United States should continue negotiations with the Soviet government in Seoul or whether the United States should unilaterally organize a provisional government in the US-occupied area.

[United Press, New York, 17th] The World Telegram commented on Wedemeyer's visit to China, saying: "The current situation in China is largely created by the United States, because Roosevelt's policy of trusting the CCP and the Soviet Union has led to today's situation where most of Manchuria and Korea have fallen into the hands of the CCP and the Soviet Union. Wedemeyer's visit to China is a prerequisite for our adoption of a constructive policy towards China to replace a hesitant policy."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] General Wedemeyer, accompanied by five advisors, boarded an army plane this morning to Nanjing. Those who went to the airport to see him off included State Department officials and some Chinese officials, including Gu Weijun, Tang Shaohua, and Huang Renlin.

### Mission Completed in China, Wedemeyer May Go to Japan

Meeting with MacArthur

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] According to headquarters sources, the rumor that Wedemeyer will stay in Tokyo briefly on his way from Washington to China is not true. Wedemeyer may come here after completing his mission in China to meet with MacArthur. If he comes here, he will reside at his friend, Eighth Army Commander Eichelberger's residence. It is heard that Wedemeyer and ten staff members took off from Washington on a (C.45) aircraft and arrived in Guam on the 21st and Nanjing on the 22nd.

### Rumors of Mongolian Troops Invading the Sui Border; Capital Officials Have Not Received Formal Reports; Xinjiang Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Enlist Rebels

[Our GuiSui Dispatch on the 17th] On June 26, an unidentified plane was discovered in the northeast of the Fourth Son of the Banner to Reconnoiter. From 1:00 to 2:00 PM on July 1, there was an unidentified...

[Associated Press, Dihua, 16th] Nationalist Army authorities today accused the rebels of attacking the highway from Dihua to other provinces of China last week. This was instigated by rebel leader Achi Maqiang to facilitate Achi's demands that the Nationalist Army withdraw from Xinjiang and replace Xinjiang Provincial Chairman Maswood. In a battle near Turpan, 120 rebels were killed, and the Nationalist Army suffered minor losses. Villages near Turpan were also attacked. Merchants were robbed and goods destroyed on the KashiGhar Road. In this battle, 500 rebels fought fiercely with the provincial army escorting the merchants. The provincial government has sent several representatives to the rebel areas to enlist them.

### The War in Western Shandong Becomes More Tragic: Communist Forces' Main Force Harasses the Outskirts of Yanzhou

At the same time, the Seventh and Ninth Columns, which retreated to Culai Mountain, besides sending a detachment to probe Sishui, their main force is also taking advantage of the mountainous terrain east of the Jinpu Railway to launch harassing attacks on the outskirts of Yanzhou. The fighting was still intense as of the evening of the 17th.

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Yanzhou, 17th] Three thousand Communist soldiers in the Anjiazhuang area north of the Dawen River crossed the Jinpu Railway east on the morning of the 17th, and the Eighth Column in Culai Mountain also showed signs of moving south. The original pontoon bridge at Dawenkou has been destroyed by floods, and the highway north of Dawenkou to Wandesh south has been severely damaged by the Communist forces.

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Xuzhou, 17th] The National Army, advancing rapidly from Tai'an towards Dawenkou, captured Zhaozhuang and Hongdongdian on the 15th, and continued to eliminate more than 1,000 Communist troops from the Second Police Brigade east of Tai'an on the 16th. On the 17th, they had already pressed close to the suburbs of Dawenkou.

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Yanzhou, 17th] The National Army has voluntarily abandoned Juye and Jiaxiang, and the fighting has shifted to the area of Jining and Ningyang. The fighting around Yangshanji, 25 li north of Jining Jinxiang, is still very fierce. A strong unit of the National Army broke through the encirclement before noon on the 17th and made contact with the National Army besieged at Yangshanji. The fighting was still intensifying as of the evening of the 17th.

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Yanzhou, 17th] The National Army has voluntarily abandoned Juye and Jiaxiang, and the fighting has shifted to the area of Jining and Ningyang, with the battle for Jining being the most tragic. In addition, the First and Fifth Columns of Chen Yi have been besieging Tengxian and Zou County for days, also quite fiercely. The Communist forces attacking Tengxian were repelled by the National Army on the 17th.

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Xuzhou, 17th] The battle for Tengxian is still fiercely underway. More than 20,000 Communist troops have been besieging Tengxian for three days and nights. On the 15th, more than 2,000 Communist troops once again stormed into the Beiyang Building in the city, but were driven back by the defending troops. In recent days, the defending troops have eliminated more than 5,000 Communist troops and captured more than 100. The National Army moving north from Lincheng and the National Army moving south from Zou County are fiercely attacking the Communist forces attacking Tengxian from both sides.

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Xuzhou, 17th] A major battle is brewing in the Zulai Mountain area. 60,000 Communist troops from the Third, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Columns have scattered to the southeast of Tai'an, west of Xintai, and northeast of Ningyang. The National Army has now completed the encirclement and is ready to annihilate them in one fell swoop. The National Army in Sishui returned to the mountainous area north of the city on the morning of the 16th to search and suppress the enemy, eliminating a Communist battalion.

### Matters to be Discussed in the Japanese Peace Treaty: Our Side is Fully Prepared; China and France Can Accept the U.S. Proposal

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] Zhang Yuan, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters on the 17th: Our side is fully prepared for the various matters to be discussed in the Japanese peace treaty and can provide materials at any time for the reference of the eleven-nation meeting in Washington. As for specific demands, such as the quota for reparations, a clear decision on whether the current Japanese political system still needs to be reformed, and the discussion and re-discussion of the status of Ryukyu and Korea, the government is considering carefully, and if a decision is made, an announcement may be issued. Zhang believes that since the U.S.'s proposed meeting in Washington on August 19 is a preparatory meeting for the peace conference, focusing on technical issues of the peace treaty, the various points of the peace treaty's content will be broadly discussed, and will not cause too much suffering because of wanting to make decisions. Zhang declined to answer a reporter's question, "If the Soviet Union refuses to participate in the meeting, what attitude will we take?" However, judging from his other statement that our delegation to the meeting may be appointed from diplomats currently stationed in the United States, and other remarks, our country has in principle decided to accept the U.S. invitation.

[Another dispatch] A diplomatic source said that if it were not for the deterioration of the domestic situation in Shandong and the Northeast, and the problems between China and the Soviet Union, China should have taken the initiative to invite negotiations on the Japanese peace treaty. The government is as anxious as the public opinion about the resolution of this long-pending Far East issue. Now that the U.S. has taken the initiative to issue the invitation, our side should put forward precise opinions to help the peace conference achieve success and lay the foundation for stability in the Far East.

[United Press Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that it is not convenient to express an opinion on the U.S. proposal to convene an eleven-nation conference in Washington on August 19 to discuss the Japanese peace treaty, and further study is needed.

[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. proposed today to convene a preliminary eleven-nation peace conference on Japan in Washington or San Francisco on August 19. China and France can accept it.

[Reuters Washington, 16th] The U.S. State Department has accepted the explanation from the British Commonwealth that the date of August 19 for convening the eleven-nation peace conference on Japan is particularly inconvenient. It is expected that the U.S. will agree to postpone the date of discussion of the peace treaty to mid-September. The British Commonwealth was originally scheduled to convene a Commonwealth conference in Canberra on August 26 to discuss the Japanese peace treaty, which would conflict with the U.S. proposal to convene an eleven-nation conference on August 19. Britain, Australia, and New Zealand have informally informed the U.S. State Department of this intention, and India will follow suit.

[Reuters Manchester, 17th] The Manchester Guardian commented on the U.S. invitation to the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission to discuss the Japanese peace treaty, saying: The U.S. believes that in the current situation, holding a foreign ministers' conference would be difficult to succeed and would increase disputes with the Soviet Union. Therefore, it has decided to abandon the principle of going through a foreign ministers' conference to deal with the Japanese peace treaty. This is a novel action, but it still requires the Soviet Union's agreement. Secretary of State Marshall certainly does not want to complete the Japanese peace treaty without the Soviet Union's participation.

### The U.S. is Determined to Disregard Soviet Opposition: Will Proceed as Planned Even If the Soviet Union Does Not Participate; The Date of the Preliminary Meeting May Be Postponed

[United Press Washington, 17th] U.S. officials admitted on the 17th that the Soviet Union's refusal to give up its veto power and allow the eleven nations, rather than the four nations, to draft the Japanese peace treaty, will make Marshall's decision difficult. Most diplomats speculate that Marshall was prepared for "the expected danger" when he proposed convening a preliminary peace conference on Japan on August 19. They feel that Marshall knows that the Soviet Union will again reject the Far East plan, just as it rejected the Marshall Plan in European conferences. These diplomats believe that if necessary, Marshall will proceed with drafting the Japanese peace treaty without the Soviet Union's participation. He can gain enthusiastic support at home, especially in Congress, as well as the support of other countries invited to participate in the peace conference. Both sides believe that the Soviet Union joined the war against Japan too late, as a latecomer. Given the U.S.'s firm policy towards the Soviet Union, it is generally believed here that if the Soviet Union obstructs, Marshall will not cancel his plan for a treaty with Japan. His basic policy towards the Soviet Union is that once a decision is made on any part of foreign policy, he will not back down. But if the Soviet Union refuses to allow the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission to begin drafting a Japanese peace treaty in Washington, it is decided to proceed even if the Soviet Union does not participate. A major principle adopted as a result of this consequence is to separate the Allied nations from Japan. However, no one here wants to take this step, but both the U.S. and the Soviet Union have solemnly declared in the United Nations Declaration that they will never conclude a peace treaty separately. If the U.S. violates this oath, a certain party will exert strong pressure, but if necessary, even greater pressure will be placed on the other party that violates the oath. The other party will also argue that wartime oaths are broken more often than observed. U.S. officials are preparing to postpone the date of the preliminary peace conference on Japan by one month.

### Japanese Side Expresses Welcome: Tokyo Stock Prices Rise

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama refused to immediately criticize the U.S. proposal to convene a preliminary peace conference on Japan in Washington on the 17th. Katayama said: The Japanese government has no immediate counter-proposal to put forward regarding this plan. However, Foreign Minister Ashida said: "Although I am not in a position to express my opinion at this time, any effort to accelerate the Japanese peace treaty is extremely welcome."

Allied Headquarters officials said: MacArthur is also not expected to issue an immediate critique. Sources in Japan believe that the U.S. initiative to accelerate the peace conference will have a great impact on encouraging Japan's hope for early independence. Japanese observers believe that the U.S. motion is related to the chaotic world situation, especially the deepening split between the U.S. and the Soviet bloc. They said: The U.S.'s recent motion to accelerate the treaty with Japan will inevitably have a major impact on Japan's feelings towards the U.S. and on the U.S. forming a front against the Communist bloc.

[Reuters Tokyo, 17th] The Tokyo Stock Exchange heard the news that a preliminary discussion meeting on the Japanese peace treaty was scheduled to be held, and all stocks rose by two to seven points, especially textile stocks. Prime Minister Katayama commented on this news, expressing extreme pleasure, and said that this conference would enable all Allied countries to become familiar with Japan's current situation before drafting a Japanese peace treaty. Foreign Minister Ashida said that every action taken to proceed with the Japanese peace treaty will be extremely welcome.

### Chief of the Allied Diplomatic Section: Acheson to Return to the U.S. Next Month

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] Acheson, the U.S. representative to the Allied Control Council for Japan and chief of the Allied Headquarters' diplomatic section, will return to the U.S. in August.

### Overseas Chinese in Yokohama Establish Trading Company

### Japanese Prohibition of Food Stalls Affects the Livelihood of Overseas Chinese

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Requests Negotiations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 17th] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has learned that in an attempt to save food, the Japanese government has banned the opening of food stalls nationwide. As a result, more than 3,000 food stalls opened by overseas Chinese in Japan have been greatly affected, and a large number of overseas Chinese will be forced to lose their jobs and have no way to make a living. In order to protect the interests of our overseas Chinese, the Commission has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly transfer the matter to our delegation in Japan and file a negotiation with the Allied Headquarters to ensure the legal protection of food stalls run by Chinese people.

### Venue for Japanese Peace Conference: There is Disagreement Among the Nations

U.S. Senator Suggests Seattle

[Our newspaper report] San Francisco, 17th broadcast: U.S. Democratic Senator Magnuson suggested to the State Department that there seems to be disagreement among the representatives of the victorious nations regarding the venue for the Japanese peace conference. MacArthur hopes to hold the meeting in Tokyo, but Britain does not agree. China advocates holding the meeting in Shanghai. A compromise solution may be to hold the meeting in Seattle, which seems more desirable.

### Second Lottery for Japanese Reparation Ships: China Gains More Than 8,000 Tons

Including Two Destroyers and Six Destroyer Escorts

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 17th] The second lottery for the 92 former Japanese warships allocated to China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union was held this morning. China received two destroyers and six destroyer escorts, totaling 8,450 tons. The Chinese representative attending the lottery said: The ships allocated to China will be driven by Japanese sailors, and may leave here for Shanghai on the 26th of this month. Rear Admiral Griffin, commander of the U.S. Far East Naval Forces, who presided over the simple informal ceremony, announced: The third lottery will be held in a few weeks. Britain won three destroyers and five destroyer escorts today, totaling 8,910 tons. The tonnage obtained by the Soviet Union was the same as that of China, and the United States obtained 8,660 tons. Griffin said: The five destroyers allocated to the United States will be destroyed. He expressed his satisfaction with the spirit of "international cooperation" shown by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in allocating the 92 Japanese ships. He said: He has always advocated holding the lottery as soon as possible so that the United States can know which ships should be destroyed, and on the other hand, can repair the ships that should be allocated to the other three countries. The destroyers participating in the lottery this time are divided into three classes: one is 1,580 tons, one is 1,530 tons, and another is 1,270 tons, which was won by Britain. The two destroyers obtained by China, one called "Ge" and one called "Shan", and one of the two 1,020-ton destroyer escorts, the Tsushima, was also allocated to China. The ships are currently berthed in Yokosuka, Kure, Sasebo, and Maizuru.

### Dismantling and Transferring Japanese Reparation Materials: China Will Set Up Two Committees to Handle Reception and Supervision

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The dismantling and transfer of Japanese early reparation materials is about to begin. The materials that China needs to dismantle in the previous month total 482,218 tons. In addition, the early dismantling materials are estimated to be more than one million. This work is extremely difficult. The Reparations Commission believes that "Reparations and Returned Materials Reception Committee" and "Reparations and Returned Materials Supervision and Transportation Committee" should be established to exclusively manage the reception and supervision of various issues, and has drafted organizational regulations and principles, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for discussion.

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 17th] The Allied Headquarters is very concerned about the transfer of reparations. Today, it invited representatives from China, the United States, the Philippines, and France to study packaging methods. Japanese packaging workers held packaging demonstrations. The Chinese representative said that the packaging of reparations is progressing slowly due to the lack of various facilities, but it is generally satisfactory.

### Puyi Moved Away from Berh: Unknown Where He Was Moved To

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 17th, United Press] According to a Japanese prisoner of war recently sent back from the Soviet Union, Puyi, the former puppet emperor of Manchuria, has been moved from Berh to an unknown location. According to reports, Puyi was captured at the end of the war. Last year, he went to Japan to testify as a witness in the Far East War Crimes Tribunal, and then was sent back to the Soviet Union. Although China wanted to extradite him for trial as a war criminal at the time, it was unsuccessful. Japanese people returning home confirmed the news, saying that Puyi moved away from Berh on July 16, accompanied by his staff and his brother Pujie.

### Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Explains: Reasons for the Arrest of German Nationals in Shanghai

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that some Nazi German nationals in Shanghai had hidden themselves in various ways during their deportation last year to avoid leaving the country. The Ministry recently sent personnel to Shanghai with relevant case files to strictly enforce the re-deportation in order to fulfill China's obligations. On the morning of the 17th, the spokesman for the Ministry told reporters about the Shanghai police's arrest of German nationals: "The German nationals arrested on the 15th and 16th of this month were those who escaped or were left behind when German nationals and Nazis were deported last year. When the special ships for overseas Chinese sailed to Europe in July and September last year, a small number of German nationals who should have been deported avoided being concentrated. The rest were approved to reside in China temporarily. The Chinese government is now taking steps to complete the work of deporting them back to Germany."

### Britain to Put Forward New Proposal: The Japanese Peace Treaty to Be Drafted by Fourteen Nations

[United Press London, 17th] Authoritative sources declared today that Britain may propose to the United States and the Soviet Union that the Japanese peace treaty be drafted jointly by fourteen nations. In addition to the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission, South Africa and Myanmar hope to participate in the peace conference, as do India and the Islamic state of Pakistan. Although South Africa did not play an active role in the war against Japan, South African Prime Minister Smuts is very concerned about the future security of India and the Pacific. Myanmar was ravaged by the Japanese army during the war and made a huge contribution to the final victory.

[Central News Agency London, 16th] The British Foreign Office issued a statement last night saying that the British government welcomes the U.S.'s proposal to consider the Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible.

The British government hopes to consult with the countries of the Far Eastern Commission and hold a meeting after the Canberra Conference to discuss the Japanese peace treaty.

### Red Cross Society Raises Funds: Chairman Chiang's Inscription: Benevolence and Love for the People, the Greatest Relief; Many Hands Make Light Work, Sharing Compassion

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Nanjing, 17th] Military News Agency News: Chairman Chiang recently wrote an inscription for the fundraising business fund of the Chinese Red Cross Society. The Society has decided to raise a business fund of 5 billion yuan, which will begin on August 1. The full text of Chairman Chiang's inscription is as follows: The Red Cross Society is originally an international social relief organization. During wartime, it focuses on the treatment of wounded and sick soldiers. Its purpose is to serve the people, without sectarianism or national boundaries, and to extend grace to the four seas equally, which is the highest activity of the human spirit today. The Red Cross Society of China was founded in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War and has a history of more than 40 years. Its great achievements and effects have been shown during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. The source of economic resources had no foundation at the beginning. Whenever disasters occur, donations are made temporarily according to the urgency of the situation, barely fulfilling the work, which is very contrary to the teaching of "preparation in advance", and especially feels the pain of temporary assistance. Since the restoration, the work has been strengthened, including social services in addition to disaster relief, and establishing a permanent business and laying a financial foundation has become the top priority. The members of the past councils have agreed, and it has been decided to raise a business fund of 5 billion yuan, establish a committee, and simultaneously raise funds in various districts, hoping to gather a number of people and establish a foundation. It is known that after the war, the people's livelihood has been in distress for a long time. People have a heart for music and justice, but their strength is difficult to follow. Only benevolence and love for the people are greater than relief. Accumulating rice and pennies, many hands make light work. Pushing the desire to save the hungry and rescue the drowning, and achieving the meaning of the Boatload of Benevolence, the benefits to the people's livelihood, and what a small supplement it is. All my countrymen and gentlemen, fortunately express their compassion and share their compassion.

### Du Zhenyuan Reports to Reporters in Guangzhou: The Truth About the Train Accident in Yingde; Derailment of a Freight Train Caused the Accident, with Only 77 Deaths and Injuries

[Our newspaper's dispatch from Guangzhou, 17th] Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, recently hosted reporters here to report on the business and the truth about the train crash in Yingde. According to reports, the road was too badly damaged during the war, and it was restored to traffic within half a year after the restoration. To date a year, due to limited financial and material resources, everything is simple, so engineering, mechanical, and transportation work has encountered some difficulties, and the impact on safety is particularly great. Now the central government has approved construction funds of 97.6 billion yuan to speed up repairs. Safety can be guaranteed in the future, but it will still take more than 300 billion yuan to restore the pre-war standards. As for the Yingde incident, it was actually caused by the derailment of a freight train, which damaged the bridge and fell into the river. It was not the bridge that broke and caused the train to derail. However, the reason for the derailment, the uneven steel rails on the bridge deck, has fallen into the river and there is no trace to be found, so it is difficult to judge for a while. This time, there were 21 deaths and 56 injuries. The reporter asked why the long-distance phone call received in Yingde that night said that there were hundreds of deaths and injuries, and why the difference was so great. Du said that there were six cars that fell into the water at that time, and it was generally believed that they were all passenger cars, and it was estimated that there would be hundreds of deaths and injuries. He also had this imagination at the time, but later investigations revealed that there was only one passenger car among them, and the rest were all freight cars, so there were actually no hundreds of deaths and injuries. Du said at the end that the bridge has now begun to be driven, and traffic can be restored in a week.

### Drought in Guanzhong: Cotton Harvest Affected

Editorial

### Our Country Should Prepare for a Peace Treaty with Japan Early

The United States, in order to expedite the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, has proposed to the eleven member states of the Far Eastern Commission that a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty be convened on August 19th. China, France, the Philippines, India, and the Netherlands are likely to agree. The United Kingdom and its dominions, having scheduled an imperial conference for August 26th to exchange views on the Japanese peace treaty issue, advocate postponing the preliminary conference. The only question remaining is the position of the Soviet Union. It is reported that when U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Smith met with Foreign Minister Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister immediately expressed dissent, arguing that the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted by the Council of Foreign Ministers without the participation of other smaller nations. However, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall told reporters that he did not believe the Soviet Union would refuse to participate in the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty. As of now, the Soviet Union's position has not been finalized. According to informed sources in Washington, the U.S. initiative for a preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty aims to convene a conference of the eleven Far Eastern nations outside the scope of the Far Eastern Commission to draft a peace treaty with Japan, thereby avoiding the Soviet Union's exercise of veto power over any proposal, so that the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty can proceed smoothly. Therefore, whether the Soviet Union accepts the invitation to participate in the conference is indeed a serious issue.

As for our country's position on the Japanese peace treaty issue, we have already expressed it clearly. Although our country does not want to adopt a retaliatory approach and make overly harsh demands on Japan, our country has fought Japan for the longest time, suffered the most from Japanese aggression, and therefore suffered the greatest losses. From the July 7th Incident to the end of the War of Resistance, the total loss of public and private property in our country amounted to no less than 300 billion U.S. dollars, not including the national military expenditures over the past eight years. The deaths and injuries of soldiers and civilians are even in the tens of millions, a colossal loss that is almost impossible to calculate. Now, after experiencing profound pain, our country is engaged in post-war reconstruction. Whether in terms of materials or economy, we need external assistance, especially Japanese reparations. Since Japan's surrender, it will soon be a full two years, and we have only seen and heard about Japan's recovery, but the date for convening the Japanese peace conference has been repeatedly postponed due to the failure to draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria, which is certainly not what our country wants. However, since the unsuccessful Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Secretary of State Marshall returned to the United States and began to consider the method of drafting a peace treaty with Japan. Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo, General MacArthur, has also repeatedly called for allied nations to accelerate the work of concluding a peace treaty with Japan. Former U.S. President Hoover even made shocking remarks early last month, advocating that the United States should exclude the Soviet Union and conclude a separate peace treaty with Germany and Japan. Although the State Department does not attach much importance to Hoover's proposal, the public feels a great interest in it. The desire of the American people for an early peace treaty with Japan is welcomed by the American people and the people of all relevant countries in the Far East.

The drafting of the Japanese peace treaty is related to the century-long plan for peace in the Far East. Before the opening of the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty, we must put forward a few opinions, firstly for everyone's reference, and secondly to awaken the attention of the people of our country.

First, our country not only made the greatest contribution to defeating Japanese imperialism during the war, but also bears the heaviest responsibility for maintaining peace in the Far East after the war. Therefore, in the Japanese peace conference, China should occupy a particularly important position, and its opinions should be given special attention by other countries. Our country itself should prepare early, so that it can have proactive suggestions when the conference opens. As Vice President Sun said on June 25th: "China should prepare to sign a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, to ensure that Japan will never become an aggressor again and to work together to promote lasting peace in the East." State Councilor Wang Chonghui also said on July 9th: "The Executive Yuan is drafting a peace treaty with Japan, the content of which focuses on disarmament, reparations, trade, and immigration policies." Before the war, Japan was not only well-versed in military force, and our country should prepare concrete measures early and submit them to the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty for discussion.

Second, although MacArthur's control of Japan has undeniable achievements, "gentlemen can be deceived by their methods." MacArthur is inevitably too lenient and overly trusts the Japanese, because of their flattery and ingratiation. For example, former Foreign Minister Shigeru Yoshida formally notified MacArthur on May 10th of "Japan's views and wishes regarding the peace treaty." According to reports from the French News Agency, the main points of this secret document are three: (1) Japan hopes to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States; (2) Japan hopes to obtain special immigration rights in Taiwan; (3) Japan hopes to obtain fishing rights in the waters near South Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. Recently, a 90-year-old Japanese politician, Yukio Ozaki, proposed a major case for the future peace treaty, the main points of which are also two: (1) "Manchuria," Taiwan, and Ryukyu should hold referendums under the supervision of the United Nations to determine whether they should be independent or belong to which country; (2) The issue of Japanese reparations should be based on the losses suffered by both sides, and the compensation should be paid to the party with the greatest losses; if the victorious countries disregard this opinion, Japan should oppose their demands with non-cooperation. From this, it can be seen that Japan's aggressive ambitions are not only not dead, but are also stirring again. The preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty will have no room for considering the Japanese's arrogant and unreasonable demands.

Third, the Far Eastern Commission decided on its basic policy toward Japan on June 19th, the ultimate goal of which is to ensure that Japan no longer becomes a threat to world peace and prosperity. If the Allied nations want to achieve this goal, we believe that there must be concrete measures stipulated in the Japanese peace treaty. We believe that the best way to prevent Japan from re-aggression is for the relevant countries in the Far East, [blank space] five powers or four powers to reach a pact to prevent Japan from having illusions of aggression.

In short, the drafting of the Japanese peace treaty is related to the century-long plan for peace and increase in the Far East. Our country should prepare early so that it can put forward effective and reasonable proposals as a basis for discussion among all countries when the preliminary conference on the Japanese peace treaty opens. We hope that all countries can face the reality of the Far East and understand our country's position, and give special attention to the opinions put forward by our country.

### Shanghai Conscription Issues

Since the State Council passed the "Strict Implementation of National Mobilization" proposal and the Executive Yuan formulated the outline for the implementation of mobilization, the issue of conscription in Shanghai has entered an active stage. To mobilize all sectors to assist in conscription, the Shanghai Conscription Association has been formally established, and a meeting will be held this afternoon to promote the work. To discuss the advancement of conscription administration, the Municipal Government's Department of Civil Affairs and the Garrison Headquarters have been holding tea parties for several days. Xu Siping, the director of the Central Conscription Bureau, has also specially come to Shanghai to attend and report. It is reported that Shanghai is ready in terms of both the competent and co-competent aspects of the implementation procedures for conscription, and it can be started on August 1st. The implementation of conscription is an unprecedented event in Shanghai, and the success or failure of the future has a great bearing and deserves attention.

Conscription is an important policy of an independent country. An independent country should have its national defense, so it must have conscription as the potential to defend the country. The constitutions of any independent country stipulate that the people have the obligation to serve in the military, and the current constitution of our country also lists special articles. The Conscription Law is a substantive law that promotes conscription affairs and stipulates that people serve in the military. It stipulates that all men of the Republic of China have the obligation to serve in the military and at the same time everyone has the right to enjoy military service. Conscription affairs are irrespective of peacetime or wartime; the situation is the same in all countries. In peacetime, one must prepare for wartime, and in wartime, one must mobilize peacetime forces to defend the country, protect the territory, and maintain the survival and independence of the nation. Conscription is indeed a continuous life force of the country and the nation, an important policy that continues for hundreds of generations without decay.

During our country's eight-year War of Resistance, frontline soldiers rushed forward one after another, and replenishment was not felt to be lacking. The final victory was due to conscription. After the victory, the Communist bandits rebelled, and the mobilization of conscription to protect the safety of the country is even more imminent. It is truly a [blank space] matter that only Shanghai has been delayed until now. Recently, the municipal authorities have shown determination to promote conscription, and have agreed with the central government that Shanghai's allocated quota is 3,000 soldiers, mainly volunteers and supplemented by conscription. At the same time, in order to ensure the fairness and impartiality of conscription, people's representatives and representatives from all walks of life have been mobilized to form the Conscription Association to assist in the matter. However, the social phenomenon in Shanghai is very complicated, and the general public's understanding of conscription is not sufficient. This first-time conscription must involve many difficulties. Therefore, we are willing to put forward the following opinions, hoping that the municipal authorities and people from all walks of life will work hard to achieve them!

First, the issue of implementing voluntary service. The legislative spirit of our country's Conscription Law is to implement conscription, which has been the military system of the country for thousands of years and is also a modern new military system. The voluntary service system is of an auxiliary nature. How to "volunteer" and how to "serve" is only stipulated flexibly in Article 32 of the Conscription Law. However, the voluntary service system is a system with higher quality soldiers. The Youth Army in our country is serving based on volunteering. Shanghai has a population of four million, and according to surveys, there are approximately 460,000 eligible young men born between 1923 and 1927. Allocating 3,000 conscripts only accounts for one-fifteenth of the eligible young men, so implementing conscription according to the law should not be a problem. The authorities are now mainly implementing voluntary service and supplementing it with conscription, probably to reduce social disturbance and anxiety. However, it should be pointed out here: voluntary service is not recruitment, and the method of handling it cannot be based on mercenary means. If you really want to implement voluntary service, you must quickly call on educated youth to join the army and encourage outstanding youth to serve the country. Only in this way can the quality of voluntary service and the honor of the past Youth Army's enthusiastic enlistment be maintained. At the same time as implementing voluntary service, conscription must not be abandoned, and the two should be carried out without contradiction.

Second, the issue of preferential treatment for conscripts' families. The Conscription Law stipulates that those who serve in the military should enjoy many rights, such as students being allowed to retain their student status when they are drafted; workers being allowed to retain their original jobs; and the government being responsible for maintaining the living standards of their families while they are on combat duty, and so on. From the perspective of those who serve in the military, this is the right they should enjoy; from the perspective of the government and society, this is a kind of preferential treatment for those who serve in the military. Shanghai has a large population and is not short of enthusiastic and righteous people. It is better than other places to raise funds for preferential treatment and collect condolence materials. Therefore, it is hoped that the Conscription Association will quickly mobilize public power and stipulate various outbreaks of preferential treatment for conscripts' families to reduce the conscripts' worries, set an example for the whole country, and change the bad social atmosphere.

Third, the issue of exemption, deferment, and conscientious objector review. Conscription is a part of mobilization work, but among eligible men, there are personnel who are "not mobilizable" in both peacetime and wartime and who are engaged in the business of other departments. The Conscription Law's exemptions and deferments of conscription are specifically set up for this purpose. In addition to the legal provisions for deferment [blank space] summons, the competent authorities do not issue thousands of miles of administrative orders for temporary arrangements. The handling of conscription in Shanghai is an unprecedented event, and the number of people who legally meet the conditions for exemption, deferment, and summons is expected to be quite large. We hope that the municipal authorities and the Conscription Association will stipulate that all those who legally meet the conditions for exemption, deferment, and summons must pay expenses as a source of funds to raise settlement expenses for conscripts. However, those who do not meet the conditions for exemption, deferment, and summons cannot be exempted from military service, even if they are willing to donate preferential treatment expenses, in order to prevent the abuse of "paying money for exemption from military service." If so, the livelihood relief of the 3,000 conscripts in Shanghai and the 3,000 conscripts' families will naturally not feel lacking.

In short, conscription is an important policy of the country, and Shanghai cannot escape it, and the people of Shanghai are even less willing to escape it. Today's country has entered an extraordinary period, and everyone must be mobilized to serve the country in order to strive for the survival of the nation. Shanghai has superior conditions for handling conscription, and there are many enthusiastic and righteous people. Although it is the first time to recruit soldiers, as long as it is done legally and reasonably, it will not only awaken the conscious and automatic investment of outstanding young people, but will surely establish a good scale, in order to receive the effect of the wind falling on the grass [immediate effect].

### France Prepares Concrete Proposals for the Implementation of the Marshall Plan, Raising Discussions at the Committee on European Economic Cooperation

[French News Agency, Paris, 16th] The Committee on European Economic Cooperation began drafting a report on European resources and their needs today. France proposed submitting eight sets of questions to the member states for their answers. The French proposal will be discussed by the Committee on European Economic Cooperation at its meeting tomorrow morning. The purpose of these eight sets of questions is to facilitate the drafting of the Committee on Cooperation's report, which will serve as the basis for the scope of U.S. economic aid to Europe.

According to the plan formulated by the French Four-Year Reconstruction Plan Committee, the eight sets of questions will determine the following three points: (1) What kind of efforts have European countries made to overcome the difficulties caused by the war? (2) What kind of mutual assistance and mutual support already exists between European countries? (3) How much external assistance do countries need at a minimum to ensure European economic recovery? The overseas territories of member states will also be included in the settlement statement in terms of the products necessary for European recovery. Methods to increase the production of these products will also be included in the European Recovery Plan.

The questions proposed by France are divided into eight categories, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Studying the difficulties caused by the war, this issue is being reviewed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. (2) Analyzing the efforts made by various countries to restore their national economies. (3) Analyzing the contributions made by various countries to the restoration of other countries. (4) Studying the efforts that European countries plan to make in the four years from 1947 to 1950. (5) The balance between supply and demand for food and raw materials. (6) The balance of imports and exports of various facilities and industrial products. (7) Determining the elements of the balance of payments for various countries from 1947 to 1950. (8) In addition to making the above-mentioned efforts, each country should also contribute to other countries in terms of loans and manpower.

[United Press, Paris, 16th] A French spokesperson recently stated that the above-mentioned eight items will be submitted to the Committee on Cooperation for discussion at 10:30 tomorrow morning, and a decision will be made immediately on their role as the main economic factors in carrying out the European Recovery Plan. It is also learned that the five-nation Executive Committee will meet at the French Foreign Ministry tonight to discuss adjusting the work schedule of the Coordination Committee and the four subcommittees on food, steel, hydroelectric power, and transportation. Representatives from Sweden and Denmark believe that the French proposal is too long, while the Dutch representative believes that it is difficult to estimate the recovery plan for more than three years.

### Anglo-American Policy Towards Germany: French Government Expresses Concern; Britain Hopes Washington Negotiations Will Expand Scope

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Reliable sources report: French Foreign Minister Bidault informed the French cabinet that during a private conversation with British Foreign Secretary Bevin, he expressed the French government's deep concern regarding the US government's directive to General Clay, commander of the US military zone in Germany and US representative to the Allied Control Council, as it indicates a potential change in US policy toward Germany. Furthermore, France is also highly concerned about the Anglo-American negotiations on German industry, fearing that these negotiations will extend beyond the scope of "industrial level" and involve the organization and political administration of the Ruhr region. France believes that this matter will have a significant impact on France's political and economic life, and therefore requests to participate in the discussions. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Bevin has assured Bidault that France will be kept informed of the progress of the Anglo-American talks in Washington.

[Reuters, London, 16th] The Anglo-American negotiations in Washington on the Ruhr coal issue have not yet reached a definite conclusion. It is only known that the chief British representative will be Mr. Strang, British political advisor in Germany, and Lieutenant General Robertson, deputy commander of the British military zone in Germany. According to speculation in Berlin, the negotiations are expected to result in an agreement to establish a new control mechanism for Ruhr coal production and to transfer the management of Ruhr coal mines to Germans under joint Anglo-American supervision.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Authoritative sources report: In light of the food and economic situation in the Anglo-American merged zone in Germany, which has increased the burden of US dollar expenditure on Britain, Britain has suggested to the United States to expand the scope of the upcoming Anglo-American talks in Washington on the Ruhr coal issue to include general economic and food issues in the Anglo-American merged zone. These talks are scheduled to take place here within the next week. It is understood that Britain is responsible for half of the expenses of the Anglo-American merged zone, which is a significant burden for Britain, which lacks US dollars. Moreover, the budget for the Anglo-American merged zone, decided in Washington last December, is now deemed insufficient, so Britain intends to take the opportunity of next week's negotiations to review it.

America Values Ruhr Coal Production

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Marshall stated here today that the United States hopes to increase coal production in the Ruhr region. Meanwhile, British authorities in Berlin announced that the Anglo-American agreement to raise German iron and steel production standards has decided to announce an indefinite extension. At a press conference today, Mr. Marshall pointed out that the increase in Ruhr coal production is the foundation of the European recovery plan. He believes that the Ruhr is the raw material center needed for European recovery and attaches great importance to it. However, he also stated that he does not intend to take any action in the near future that would cast doubt on the fact that the initiative for the Marshall Plan for European aid should be in the hands of Europe.

No Change in Policy Towards Germany

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] US Secretary of Commerce Harriman stated here today that US policy toward Germany has not changed due to the US government's directive to General Clay, commander of the US military zone in Germany, yesterday. After pointing out that the average industrial production in the Anglo-American zone in Germany is only 38% of the 1936 level, while the average industrial production in the rest of Europe has reached 90% of the 1936 level, Mr. Harriman declared that the United States does not intend to give Germany a priority position in the economic recovery of Europe. The United States has not granted and does not intend to grant such a priority position, but intends to enable Germany to fulfill its due obligations in the economic recovery of Europe. The issuance of the directive to General Clay at this time has absolutely no special purpose. Mr. Harriman also said that the United States is greatly encouraged by the achievements of the Paris Conference and is now awaiting its results.

### Wallace Supports the Marshall Plan

Claims Soviet Union Will Harm Its Reputation in Europe

[United Press, New York, 16th] Wallace recently published an article in the current issue of "The New Republic," advocating that the United Nations should immediately implement a non-political emergency foreign relief plan. He strongly argued that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's withdrawal from the Paris Economic Conference would undoubtedly damage the Soviet Union's reputation in Europe. He stated: According to the Marshall Plan for European economic aid, it will take at least a year before supplies can be shipped to Europe, so it is essential to address Europe's needs immediately. This is extremely important. The United Nations can only strengthen its position by implementing an emergency relief plan. In addition, a path must be opened to fully implement the cooperation plan originally intended by Marshall. Regarding the proposal to make a separate peace with Germany and unite Western countries outside the United Nations, he expressed opposition. He also said that if the United States forcefully implements its original control plan and forces the United Nations General Assembly to accept or reject it, we will face the danger of reorganizing the United Nations. At the very least, we will see the establishment of a defense system outside the United Nations structure.

### Italian Foreign Minister Suggests Franco-Italian Economic Alliance

[United Press, Paris, 17th] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza stated before returning to Italy that establishing a Franco-Italian economic alliance would promote the interests of both countries, and this alliance should include a customs union.

### European Economic Commission Ends Unhappily

Scheduled to Hold Another Meeting Early Next Year

[United Press, Geneva, 16th] The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ended its ten-day meeting on the 16th amidst extreme views from the Soviet Union and Western countries. Soviet representative Tsarapkin, in his closing remarks, accused the policies of Britain and the United States of dividing Germany and the entire Europe. Mr. Tsarapkin also made some complimentary remarks about France.

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 16th] The United Nations Economic Conference for Europe engaged in fierce debate today. The chairman, having no choice, immediately intervened and announced the adjournment of the second session, with the third session scheduled to be held in 1948.

### Albanian Prime Minister Visits the Soviet Union; Stalin Receives Him

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 16th] Marshal Stalin received Albanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister General Hoxha today. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the Albanian Ambassador to the Soviet Union were also present.

### Polish Representative Suggests to the Security Council that Foreign Troops Should Withdraw from Greece; Debate on Egypt's Complaint Against Britain Rescheduled

[Our Report] London, 17th Broadcast: Poland today requested the Security Council to organize a united government in Greece and to expel foreign troops and "military advisors" stationed in Greece through United Nations action. It is believed here that the purpose of Poland's suggestion is to hinder the work of the United Nations border investigation team on the Greek, Albanian, and Bulgarian borders.

[Our Report] London, 17th Broadcast: The Security Council held a meeting today. The important developments were as follows: (1) The Polish representative requested the Security Council to find a way to end the seven-year state of war between Greece and Albania; (2) The British representative stated that he did not object to Egypt's demand to end British occupation of the Nile River. However, because the Balkan issue is more important, the British-Egyptian issue should be postponed to August 5 for discussion. The result was passed.

### US Position Firm

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] United Nations officials stated today that if the Soviet Union exercises its veto to prevent the Security Council from establishing a semi-permanent Balkan investigation team, the United States may propose establishing an investigation team outside the United Nations structure to monitor the situation on the Greek border. This could be done by having Greece invite other members of the United Nations to form an independent investigation team, establish a headquarters in Greece, and monitor the activities of Balkan guerrillas. Although this investigation team would not have authority, it could collect information and submit it to their respective governments when the United Nations General Assembly meets in September. However, the United States and Britain seem to be trying their best to change reality and take other measures before resorting to this approach. According to well-informed sources, if the Soviet Union uses its veto power to obstruct this matter, a new complaint may be filed in the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter regarding threats to peace and breaches of peace. At that time, the Security Council can discuss measures other than the use of force, such as economic sanctions and severance of diplomatic relations, to deal with the accused country.

### Strengthening Turkey's Transportation System: Ten US Merchant Ships Sold to Turkey

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Secretary of State Marshall revealed today that he has requested the US Maritime Commission to approve the sale of ten US merchant ships to Turkey under the recent aid to Turkey plan approved by Congress. Mr. Marshall requested that, to his knowledge, this is the first batch of materials transferred to Turkey under the aid to Turkey plan. These ships will be sold to the purchasing delegation of the Turkish Ministry of Transportation, and the Turkish government will pay the price. The purpose of the sale is to enable Turkey to replace old ships with new ones to strengthen its transportation system.

### Truman Unwilling to Participate in Direct Talks Among the Big Three

[United Press, Washington, 17th] It was learned on the 17th that President Truman stated that unless Soviet Marshal Stalin and British Prime Minister Attlee travel to the United States to confer with him, he will continue to firmly oppose holding another Big Three conference. This news was revealed on the second anniversary of the ill-fated Potsdam Conference. That Big Three conference was Truman's first and perhaps last participation in a high-level secret international conference. Truman and his advisors believe that it is not advisable for heads of state to participate in secret negotiations during peacetime, and it is incompatible with the American system. They also openly blamed the secret agreements of the late President Roosevelt for being responsible for many of the current world disputes. Few of the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement have been implemented because the major powers have failed to find an acceptable way to implement them, especially the provisions concerning Germany. After two years of fruitless disputes and negotiations, although each major power claims to still adhere to its overall goals, the Potsdam Agreement, whether in implementation or in form, has become waste paper. US officials admit that the United States and the Soviet Union are now engaged in a full-scale diplomatic and economic war, and US-Soviet relations are deteriorating at an accelerating rate, and will deteriorate sharply in the near future.

### Guerrillas Suffer Heavy Blows; Greek War Turns Quiet; British Officers Assist in Suppression of Rebellion as Advisors

[Our Report] Wanjingshan, 17th Broadcast: The Greek war has become quiet today. The guerrillas who attacked Greece from Albania have retreated to the border mountains after suffering heavy blows from the government forces. There were only minor conflicts today.

[United Press, Athens, 16th] Military sources announced today that the Greek army, under the protection of aircraft and heavy artillery, launched a large-scale offensive tonight against approximately 2,500 guerrillas in the mountainous area north of Ioannina, near the Albanian border, wiping out 300 of them. The main force of the guerrillas retreated eastward, attempting to join other left-wing bandits in the Grammos Mountains. Army aircraft stepped up their pursuit, while infantry swept through the rear guard forces covering their retreat. Before the government forces began their advance, they heavily bombed and strafed the guerrilla-trapped area on the slopes of Mount Gamila, encountering resistance only near Elafotopos and Asproangeloi, about 19 miles from Ioannina.

[Reuters, London, 16th] A British Foreign Office spokesman solemnly denied that any form of British troops had actively participated in Greece's war against the guerrillas. When asked whether British officers had assisted the Greek government forces attacking the guerrillas in an advisory capacity, he replied that the mission of British troops in Greece was to help maintain order, which was well known to all. It is reported that Greek guerrilla commander Markos claimed to have captured British officers and soldiers, and the British Foreign Office made the above statement in response.

[Reuters, London, 26th] Tirana Radio reported a report from the Albanian Telegraph Agency denying that Albanian guerrilla units were fighting in the Konitsa area of northern Greece, and denying the claim that an "international brigade" had invaded Greece from Albania.

### Large Numbers of Greek Leftists Deported

[United Press, Athens, 17th] Police announced that several women had been arrested during the cracking down of a communist women's organization and would soon be deported to the island of Sikinos. The 1,250 leftists arrested on Monday have been deported to the island of Ikaria. The government will send an investigation committee to the island on the 19th to determine who can be released immediately after submitting a letter of repentance.

### Holy Land Issue Included in the Provisional Agenda of the UN General Assembly

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 16th] Acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Beattie, told the press today that the Palestine issue has been included in the provisional agenda of the United Nations General Assembly to be held in September. There are currently 38 items on the provisional agenda, most of which were left over from the previous General Assembly without a decision, such as the Spanish issue. The provisional agenda will be sent to the governments of the member states on the 17th of this month. The Palestine issue will be presented in three aspects: (1) The request submitted by Britain, which mainly discusses the Palestine issue during the ordinary session of the General Assembly; (2) The report of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine; (3) The request submitted by Saudi Arabia and Iraq, which mainly advocates that Britain terminate its trusteeship over Palestine and recognize the independence of Palestine. According to officials in charge, the next session of the United Nations General Assembly will last for seven weeks.

### Dutch-Indonesian Crisis at a Critical Juncture; Indonesian People Make Final Efforts; Sjahrir Has Declared Rejection of Dutch Demands

[Our Report] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: The special cabinet meeting in the Netherlands has been changed to Thursday night to await Indonesia's final response to the ceasefire proposal.

[Our Report] London, 17th Broadcast: The Dutch cabinet will convene an emergency meeting on the afternoon of the 17th to decide whether to use force against the Indonesian Republican army, which refuses to accept the ultimatum for a ceasefire within the time limit. News also: It is widely believed that the Dutch cabinet will decisively break with the Republic of Indonesia, or mobilize 100,000 Dutch troops in Java to respond to the incident. The Dutch believe that the Republic of Indonesia has violated the ceasefire agreement signed on March 27 of this year.

[Our Report] San Francisco, 17th Broadcast: The Indonesian National Army recently issued a bulletin listing 300 incidents of the Netherlands violating the truce agreement in mid-June, including cross-border shelling, aerial reconnaissance, and conflicts of varying degrees on land and sea.

[United Press, Batavia, 27th] According to the Dutch News Agency: Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Gani and Deputy Foreign Minister Thamrin carried the Republic's response to the Dutch proposals for a joint gendarmerie and ceasefire with them when they flew from Yogyakarta to here on the afternoon of the 17th.

[Reuters, Batavia, 17th] Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister Setyadjit suddenly fell ill last night after holding talks with Dutch Indonesian Governor-General Van Mook. This morning, Indonesian Deputy Foreign Minister Thamrin continued to meet with Van Mook in a final attempt to save the Indonesian crisis. It is reported that the British Consul-General in Batavia, Mr. Mitchison, sent a letter to Van Mook last night supporting Indonesia's request for a 24-hour extension to allow the Republican cabinet to consider the joint police force proposal. After meeting with Van Mook, Thamrin took a Dutch plane back to Yogyakarta to obtain the most recent decision of the Indonesian cabinet.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 17th] Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir declared on the radio yesterday that the Indonesian government had rejected the Dutch proposal to organize a Dutch-Indonesian joint gendarmerie. The Dutch also rejected Indonesia's request to extend the deadline for stopping hostilities along the demarcation line by 24 hours. The original deadline was midnight on July 16.

### British Cabinet Reorganization; India Office Abolished

[Reuters, London, 16th] Sources here reveal that the transfer of political power in India has forced the British cabinet to make changes. After the abolition of the India Office, Lord Listowel, who was originally the Minister of State for India and Burma Affairs, will now only be the Minister of State for Burma Affairs. Mr. Henderson, who was originally the Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma Affairs, will become the Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, responsible for British relations with India and Pakistan, and will represent Lord Listowel in being accountable to the House of Commons for Burmese affairs. The Commonwealth Relations Office is the former Dominions Office, renamed because the name "Dominion" no longer suits the environment. The Minister for Commonwealth Relations is Lord Addison, and in addition to Mr. Henderson, the Under-Secretaries of State already include Mr. Bottomley.

### Churchill Attends the House of Commons for the First Time After Recovery

[Reuters, London, 16th] Opposition leader Churchill appeared in the House of Commons tonight for the first time since undergoing hernia surgery on June 7. Mr. Churchill, at the age of 71, is as vigorous as ever, and his colleagues in the parliament congratulated him one after another.

### Gandhi's 79th Birthday; Indians Celebrate for 79 Days

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 16th] October 2nd is the 79th birthday of the Indian Mahatma Gandhi. Today is the 79th day. The city of Meerut, the political activity center of the National Congress Party, has begun celebrating Gandhi's birthday. 79 men, 79 women, 79 boys, and 79 girls will perform spinning for 79 days. They will also raise 790,000 yards of cloth and 7,900 rupees in cash, which will be dedicated to the 79-year-old birthday celebrant Gandhi.

### Soviet Union Proposes Control of Atomic Energy; Establishes International Distribution System; Representatives of Various Countries Have Not Expressed Opinions

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] Soviet representative Gromyko proposed at a secret meeting of the Political Committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission on the 16th that a world atomic agreement be signed to control the mining and distribution of uranium and thorium resources in various countries. He also said that if this proposal is accepted, there may be decisive progress in the global control of atomic energy. The scope of the Soviet proposal may include all atomic energy equipment and atomic energy elements, and will detail the methods and limits for each country to use atomic energy equipment and elements. Gromyko advocated the establishment of a separate special committee to study these limits, so that the Atomic Energy Commission would not have the power to intervene in this matter. Gromyko also argued that the limits should be adjusted each time, and the agreement could also be amended. Representatives of various countries were unwilling to express their opinions on the Soviet Union's sudden proposal. This proposal is the Soviet Union's third proposal. Gromyko had previously proposed concluding an agreement to immediately destroy atomic bombs and then proposed the organization of an international control agency to investigate and control atomic energy. The United States advocated that the International Atomic Energy Agency should have the right to handle all uranium resources that have been mined in the world, but this was opposed by Gromyko.

### Soviet-Controlled Japanese Communist Party

Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Department

The Soviet Union's strategy of using the Japanese Communist Party to oppose the American occupation authorities created the most critical situation since the American occupation of Japan in January of this year. Labor unions controlled by the Communist Party were brewing a general strike to sabotage the Japanese economic system. At that time, strike leaders received notification from the occupation authorities prohibiting the strike. According to Japanese people familiar with the inner workings of the Communist Party, the Communist Party committee that directed the strike had contacted Soviet personnel stationed in Japan to obtain Soviet support.

According to a certain labor union report: Soviet authorities told the Japanese Communist Party: "You should remember the sixteen principles." (Note: The Far Eastern Commission announced sixteen principles regarding Japan on December 18, 1946, one of which permitted strikes for "political action.") A Soviet adjutant told the Japanese Communist Party to simply ignore the occupation forces' orders prohibiting strikes. At the same time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued an order, shamelessly stating: "Regarding our strike, we have already obtained the understanding of the Soviet representative on the Allied Control Committee. Therefore, there is no need to fear the orders of the occupation authorities." Although the Japanese Communist Party claims to have 50,000 members, only 25,000 Communist Party members dare to defy the Japanese occupation forces. However, their influence far exceeds their actual numbers. They run newspapers and many Japanese magazines, organize cultural societies and people's fronts, establish youth groups and a university. The Communist Party often exploits the general ignorance of the common people, launching demonstrations, waving red flags, and shouting slogans they do not understand, which ultimately led to a ban by the occupation authorities.

The Japanese Communist Party is now making every effort to instigate the historically conservative farmers. They were the behind-the-scenes instigators of the recent disturbances that prevented rice and grain from being transported to the cities. During the last general election, they did not focus on parliamentary elections, but instead devoted all their efforts to local elections. Several non-partisan candidates later became Communist Party members. They are also trying to get Communist Party members into schools to make up for the 120,000 Japanese teachers who were purged.

However, the main method by which the Communist Party expands its influence is by infiltrating and controlling various labor unions. In Japan, where the labor union movement is still in its infancy, the Communist Party can also manipulate labor unions in other ways, such as often being able to win over inexperienced labor union leaders. They can also recommend technical personnel such as bookkeepers and typists to new labor unions, and gradually rise to important positions such as secretaries. The Japanese Congress of Industrial Organizations, an important labor union organization, is controlled by the Communist Party. Many of the labor unions affiliated with the Congress are effectively controlled by the Communist Party. The two major strongholds of the Communist Party are the National Railway Workers' Union, which has 540,000 workers, and the Transportation Workers' Union, which has 380,000 workers. In Japan, as in other countries, the Communist Party is using all its strength to control key industries that could cause the country's economy to collapse instantly.

In January of this year, the Japanese Communist Party used the labor union power it had already acquired to stage a surprising demonstration. As usual, they put forward a resolute demand, citing high prices as the reason, and demanding a wage increase. The Communist Party then organized the "National Federation of Government and Public Employees' Struggle Committee," which was soon expanded into the "National Federation of Labor Union Struggle Committee." The Communist Party occupied one-third of the forty-six members of the committee, which was more than enough to control the committee. At the same time, the three leaders and senior cadres of the committee were also controlled by the Communist Party.

The purpose of the "United Struggle Committee" was to implement the policies of the Communist Party and launch a general strike of the two million workers represented by the committee. Part of the goal was to overthrow the conservative Yoshida Cabinet. Therefore, the committee deliberately put forward extremely high demands that the government could hardly accept. Therefore, this strike was clearly political, which was admitted by Shiga, one of the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party. The Communist Party could invoke the sixteen principles announced by the Far Eastern Committee in Washington at any time.

However, the main purpose of the Japanese Communist Party was to create chaos in Japan in order to undermine the American occupation. The consequences of the strike, in addition to the industry falling into a state of paralysis, would immediately lead to starvation and social unrest. This is the result of the deepening resentment between the occupation authorities and the Communist Party. The Communist Party initially thought that the Americans treated them very well, because the Americans not only released them from prison, but also received them very politely. However, by the autumn of 1946, the Communist Party realized their mistake and began to oppose and attempt to undermine the American occupation mission.

The Communist Party's attempt to brew a general strike ultimately failed. MacArthur resolutely issued an order prohibiting strikes, and warned of severe punishment for violations. At that time, the Soviet Union was unable to fulfill its promise to support the Japanese Communist Party. Since then, Japanese public opinion has been unanimously opposed to the Japanese Communist Party. But the Japanese Communist Party forced MacArthur to interfere in Japan's internal affairs against his will. In addition, the American occupation is still bound by the sixteen principles of the Far Eastern Commission, the White House's orders encouraging the labor union movement, and the Potsdam Declaration. Until the above-mentioned orders are changed, the Japanese Communist Party can still openly challenge the American occupation authorities. (Translated from Newsweek)

### Far East Economic Commission Establishes Contact with Japan and South Korea

Non-UN Members Permitted to Attend

[Central News Agency New York, 16th] The plenary committee of the Far East Economic Commission passed a proposal made by the U.S. and the Soviet Union today to formally establish contact between Japan and South Korea and the committee. The United States proposed the following terms of reference to the committee: The committee may consult with representatives of the Allied Headquarters in Japan and representatives of the occupation authorities in Korea, and the latter may also consult with the committee in order to exchange information and provide opinions on economic issues related to other Far Eastern countries and the economies of Japan and South Korea. The Soviet proposal was almost identical to the American one, except that it did not directly name Japan and South Korea, but only referred to "occupied areas." The Soviet Union further requested that the committee's powers be expanded to make recommendations to member states. The plenary committee finally passed a joint US-Thailand proposal today to resolve the procedural dispute over allowing sponsoring conferences to participate in the committee. The proposal stipulates that any country within the geographical scope of the committee in the Far East that is not a member of the United Nations may apply to the country responsible for its diplomacy to become a sponsoring member. If those countries are already responsible for their own diplomacy, they can apply directly. The latter is clearly designed for Burma and Ceylon, as these two non-UN member states will likely gain dominion or independent nation status.

### Qiantang Train Derailed in Danyang Early Detection Prevented Major Accident Passengers Transported to Shanghai in Two Batches All Trains Delayed

[This newspaper reported] At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, the Qiantang train (Beijing-Hangzhou express train), train No. 1, from Beijing to Shanghai, derailed on its rear wheels of the third FD 613 first-class dining car at 10:14 a.m. after passing Danyang Station (non-stop). Fortunately, the speed of the train was very low at this time, and there were many people on the station. The stationmaster had not yet left, and witnessed the train making strange noises and violent shocks, knowing that an accident had occurred. He immediately dispatched two station workers to catch up with the locomotive with red flags to notify them to brake immediately, avoiding a rollover. All passengers were safe and sound. The passenger car was also undamaged, only two sections of steel rail were slightly curled, and more than 200 sleepers were broken by the shock. Changzhou Station heard the sound and urgently dispatched a rescue train to the scene of the accident. Chen Baoxing, the chief of the engineering section, personally led more than 100 technicians to repair and replace the damaged steel rails and sleepers, which took 40 minutes to repair. After the accident, the train had unloaded the third dining car. The locomotive and the first and second first-class carriages were not affected and departed for Shanghai at 10:50 a.m., arriving in Shanghai at 4:23 p.m. The six passenger cars behind the dining car were temporarily added to the locomotive and drove to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station of this city at 7:01 p.m. The first and second first-class passenger cars arrived in Hangzhou only 55 minutes later than usual. The fifth, seventh, and fifteenth trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line were delayed by two or three hours, and other trains were not affected.

### Disturbance at Danyang Station

At that time, Danyang Station was blamed by the passengers of the Qiantang train, which once caused a disturbance. Because this accident did not cause a major disaster, the passengers were deeply grateful. Since it was close to noon, and the station informed them that the repair would take a long time, the passengers went ashore to Danyang city to eat. Unexpectedly, when they returned to the station after the meal, the locomotive had already towed the first two passenger cars away. Many of the passengers in the first two sections had placed their briefcases, long gowns, and tops in the cars. The passengers in the last six sections complained that the locomotive should not have towed the first two sections first, and also rose up to blame. The Transportation Department of the Railway Bureau promised to send a telegram to the stationmasters along the line to carefully protect the ownerless luggage and sundries in the first two cars, and to send another locomotive to tow the last six passenger cars to Shanghai and Hangzhou.

It is reported that the reason why this derailment did not become a major disaster was that the recent Railway Bureau's traffic safety meeting decided that from the 11th to the 22nd of this month, it was the week of work safety competition, and the speed of all trains was generally reduced. The speed of the Qiantang train at the time of the accident yesterday was 33 kilometers per hour (the slowest limit). If it was still at the normal speed (50 kilometers), it would have led to a fatal rollover. As for the cause of the derailment, the Engineering Department and its colleagues were still puzzled after studying it, because there was no broken rail there, and the sleepers and steel rails were all in good condition, and the driving speed was extremely slow, so there was no reason to explain the cause of the accident. Danyang Station has taken detailed photos of the situation and reported it to the Administration, and experts will study it further.

### North Railway Station Renovation and Expansion Expected to be Completed by End of September Order Should be Improved

[This newspaper reported] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration believes that there are many passengers at the North Railway Station in this city, and vehicles are frequent. Although there is a large square in front of the station, the entrances and exits are narrow and uneven. The vehicles parked in the square are also lacking in meticulous distribution. The Engineering Department of the Administration has prepared a large-scale renovation and expansion plan, and has agreed to assist with the City Engineering Bureau, raise special funds, and start construction on the 13th. The various projects will be carried out in stages, and it is expected that all work can be completed by the end of September this year. According to its engineering plan: the entrance to Tianmu Road does not include three entrances. Cars in the middle row can directly reach the main entrance of the terminal station. The left and right entrances are used by rickshaws, tricycles, or pedestrians. All rickshaws and vehicles used by passengers in the second, third, and fourth classes will use the right-hand entrance, pass through the road in front of the dining room, and go directly to the large waiting room. Rickshaws used by first-class passengers will use the left-hand entrance and get off at the south right side of the station. There is a private car parking lot in the middle of the square, 56 meters long and 30 meters wide, which can park more than 60 cars. The ground is inlaid with iron sheets to mark the location of each car. A horseshoe-shaped lane is built around the parking lot. The exit leads to Baoshan Road. The original road width is only 6 to 12 meters. Now it is decided to widen it to 20 meters uniformly, rebuild the large stone road, and pave a 7.5 cm thick asphalt concrete pavement. The area in front of the large waiting room is still a parking area for traffic vehicles, and the Baoshan Road intersection on the east side is designated as a parking area for business trip vehicles (can accommodate 15 vehicles). More than 30 private cars can be parked on the south side of the road to supplement the square. In the east, a 40-meter-long and 5.5-meter-wide rickshaw parking area is designated, which can park more than 70 rickshaws. The sidewalks around the station are twice as wide as before. After the entire project is completed, there will be no more congestion in traffic, and order will be improved. Pickpockets and thieves will not be able to use their skills, which is a great benefit to passengers on both roads.

### Detaining Ships and Extorting Taxes Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Strict Punishment

The City Chamber of Commerce received a joint letter from the members of the Pig Industry Commercial Guild, Yuansheng, Huiyuan, and Tianyuan, stating that at 7:00 a.m. on July 9, a sailing ship transporting fresh pigs from Nantong Ren Port to Shanghai arrived at Tangqing Port (transliteration) upstream of Liu River at about 2:00 p.m. A team of ten people wearing grass green uniforms and hats with the military symbol (one person in a suit), approached on two ships and ordered them to pay taxes, at least 70,000 yuan per pig. When they were told that they had no money to pay the tax, they detained the ship in the port. After repeated requests, they initially demanded ten pigs to offset the tax, but eventually reduced it to eight pigs (and were extorted 60,000 yuan in cash), forcing them to send them to the team headquarters, and gave them a receipt, claiming to be the First Joint Defense Patrol Team. The association believes that the military's supplies are planned and allocated by the Ministry of National Defense, and should not be borrowed from the people privately. The chairman has repeatedly issued strict prohibitions, which are published in newspapers. They have telegraphed to the First Pacification Headquarters of Nantong and the Zhenjiang Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting a thorough investigation and strict punishment, to protect merchants and people's livelihood.

### Two Wage Dispute Cases Solved

Shanghai Machine Factory Workers Petition

[This newspaper reported] The index dispute in the iron can manufacturing industry has been resolved.

### Shanghai Silk Mill Closes; Social Bureau Approves Layoffs

[Our Correspondent] Due to sluggish business, the Shanghai Silk Mill has announced its closure. The Social Bureau has approved the dismissal of all workers, who will be paid severance according to their years of service and the layoff plan decided by the Labor-Management Arbitration Board, based on the cost of living index for June.

### Rental Management Measures Deemed Unfair by Guild

[Our Correspondent] Chen Tingkun, Secretary-General of the Real Estate Industry Guild of this city, expressed his opinion on the city government's decision on the "Rental Management Measures for Houses in This City" the day before yesterday, stating that, generally speaking, the measures can take care of both landlords and tenants, but what is regrettable is that the phrase "based on 10% of the total of the above actual expenses" added in parentheses after adding profits in the first article is not fair. Judging from the provision in Article 4 of these measures regarding the subletting of houses, which states that "the maximum shall not exceed twice the original rent," the bias is very obvious. Because the original rent of the sub-landlord is the total amount of expenses for the house, in other words, the profit of the landlord, which can only be based on 10% of the total expenses, while the profit of the sub-landlord can be 100% of the total expenses. Moreover, the owner's investment in the property and the depreciation of the house have not been taken into account. In this regard, it seems that only the interests of the sub-landlord's subletting have been paid attention to, and the rights and interests of the owner are still suppressed.

### Military Service is a National Obligation; Conscription is to Establish National Defense; Commander Fu Elaborates on the Significance to All Sectors

[Our Correspondent] Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, held a tea party at 3:00 p.m. yesterday on the third floor of the Tanggu Road Municipal Council to entertain people from all walks of life and the press, reporting on the promotion of military administration, and issued a "Notice to the Citizens of Shanghai," listing three points to explain the significance of the government's implementation of conscription: (1) Military service is the obligation of modern citizens, (2) The conscription system is the foundation for establishing national defense, (3) The military service system is a common system in ancient and modern China. He once again explained the reason for changing conscription to voluntary service, and finally announced to the citizens four working attitudes: (1) The recruitment of volunteers will be handled in accordance with regulations, (2) Sound personnel management to eliminate malpractices, (3) Pay attention to training and improve conservation, (4) Take the opinions of the public and publicize government orders. Xu Siping, Director of the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, delivered a speech, citing various aspects of military administration in detail. Mayor Wu, Director Fang, Zhao Yangxiong, and others also delivered speeches one after another, hoping that all citizens would understand the difficulties of the times, jointly assist, establish a military service system, lay the foundation, and complete the century-old plan of national construction. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 p.m.

Xu Siping, Director of the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, after attending Commander Fu's tea party yesterday, met with reporters from this newspaper and said: In view of the various malpractices in handling military administration during the war, the government will pay close attention to the conservation of recruits and the preferential treatment of the families of strong men in the future to promote military administration, so as to ensure that recruits can serve with peace of mind and reduce their fear.

Director Xu has completed his official business in Shanghai and took a car back to Nanjing last night.

### Believe it or Not: Flying Saucers Visit Shanghai

[Our Correspondent] Three flying saucers have visited Shanghai! This was stated by an Italian expatriate to a reporter from the English-language "Da Mei Evening News" yesterday. He spoke vividly, claiming that his residence was near Longhua in the western district of the former French Concession. At 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning, he was tossing and turning in bed and could not fall asleep. He happened to look out the window and suddenly saw a gray-white object flying over the top of an apartment building across from his apartment, flying quickly towards the Bund at about the speed of an ordinary airplane. It was flat in shape, shiny, but did not emit light. At that time, it was not yet dawn and the sky was dark, so he saw this gray-white, aura-like object very clearly. About fifteen minutes after this "flying saucer" flew past, he saw two more, but they disappeared in a flash. Whether they had flown out of his sight or were hidden by clouds, he did not know. Since the mystery of the flying saucer has been hyped up in the United States, people all over the world have been suspicious. It has been reported that flying saucers have been discovered in Shenyang and Xi'an in our country in recent days. Now there is a saying that they have visited Shanghai. Whether to believe it or not is up to the readers to judge for themselves.

### Passenger and Freight Rates on Ships Are Being Brewed for Another Adjustment

[Our Correspondent] Passenger and freight rates for ships were adjusted on June 12 of this year, and then again on July 7. According to news from the shipping industry, shipping companies are still unable to make up for the increased costs of all raw materials, fuels, etc., so the guild is studying another adjustment to the freight rates to provide financial support.

However, passengers have been significantly affected by the previously increased fares, and if they are adjusted again, they will not be able to afford it.

### Zhang Jia'ao Continues the Romance in Beiping; The Newlyweds Fly to Shanghai Today

The bride, Zhou Bixia, was once famous in social circles

[Our Correspondent] Zhang Jia'ao (see picture), Governor of the Central Bank, recently married Ms. Zhou Bixia in the former capital. According to reliable sources, Mr. Zhang's trip to the Northeast has now been cancelled. He returned to Beiping from Tianjin at noon on the 16th, and took a trip to the suburbs at noon on the 17th. He is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai this morning (the 18th).

Ms. Zhou is over forty years old. Before the war, she graduated from Shanghai McTyeire School and was quite famous in Shanghai social circles fifteen or sixteen years ago. Zhang Jia'ao was then the President of the Bank of China, and they met and became friends at that time. During the Anti-Japanese War, Ms. Zhou traveled to the United States, where Mr. Zhang was also inspecting railways. They interacted more and more frequently, and their feelings grew stronger. After the victory, when Mr. Zhang was ordered to preside over the Economic Commission of the Northeast Headquarters, Ms. Zhou was still in the United States and did not return until last year.

Mr. Zhang held the wedding in Beiping this time without a public ceremony. He only invited a few tables of guests, and a few friends attended to congratulate him. According to a telegram from a special correspondent of this newspaper in Beiping: Mr. Zhang married Ms. Zhou secretly at a certain place on the third day of his arrival in Beiping. Local transportation and financial tycoons seemed to keep silent about this matter. However, when Li Zongren and his wife hosted a banquet for Hu Zhengzhi without his wife at 7:00 p.m. on the 4th, Zhang Jia'ao also accompanied his new wife to the banquet. Those present at the time also included He Siyuan and his wife, Wang Hongshao (Chief of Staff of the Beiping Executive Headquarters), and Xiao Yishan. According to witnesses, Mrs. Zhang wore a light blue cheongsam that day and looked as beautiful as a woman in her thirties.

It is rumored that Mr. and Mrs. Zhang live upstairs in the Beiping Office of the Northeast Economic Commission at Dengshikou. People around Zhang insist that the several female guests upstairs are Zhang's sisters and relatives. It is reported that Mr. Zhang is now 59 years old and has been widowed for several years. He has nine children, the youngest of whom is nicknamed "Little Nine" and is currently studying in Beiping.

### An Additional 10,000 Yuan in Expenses for Each Shi of Low-Priced Rice; Industrial Workers Get Two Jin of Cooking Oil per Month

[Our Correspondent] The Municipal Food Allocation Committee held its third meeting at its meeting place on Huangpi South Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The meeting was presided over by Director Wu Kaixian. First, the persons in charge of the investigation, review, and distribution departments reported on the work situation, and then the discussion began. The important proposals are as follows:

Low-Priced Rice for Poor Households to be Distributed Soon

(1) Low-priced broken rice for poor households is calculated at 168,000 yuan per shi. Recently, an order was received from the Ministry of Food to increase 10,000 yuan per shi for excavation expenses. The low-priced rice for June can be distributed after the low-priced rice certificates are issued in a few days. The budget for handling low-priced rice expenses reported by each district is uniformly approved as: 1. Transportation fee is 4,000 yuan per shi in the urban area and 7,000 yuan per shi in the suburban area; 2. Warehouse fee is 1,300 yuan per shi; 3. Office expenses for each low-priced rice handling by the district office are 1 million yuan per district; 4. Handling fee for rice shops selling low-priced rice is 800 yuan per shi; 5. Loss is generally limited to no more than 0.2 liters per shi. Because the stipulated handling fee for each low-priced rice station (rice shop selling low-priced rice) is only 800 yuan per shi, each district will generally sell 500 shi through each low-priced rice station, and the suburban area may appropriately increase the amount.

Private Hospitals to Stop Allocating Rice

(2) The "Implementation Measures for Oil Allocation for Industrial Workers" were approved, with two jin per person, once a month, handled by the Food Allocation Committee. Each factory only needs to list the grain allocation order number, household number, and number of people of the original rice allocation to apply for allocation, without having to create a separate roster. The "Implementation Measures for Oil Allocation" will be announced after President Zhang of the Central Bank returns to Shanghai from North China and the China Trust Bureau signs an agreement with the Allocation Committee. The committee also received an order from the Ministry of Food to stop allocating rice to private hospitals from now on.

Coal Briquettes for Allocation Yet to be Decided

The matter of allocating coal briquettes to workers was also mentioned at yesterday's meeting. Some committee members believed that the Food Allocation Committee should only handle food and should not be responsible for allocating coal briquettes. Wu Kaixian believed that the Allocation Committee has already handled the allocation of rice and oil to workers, so it seems easy to handle, and the allocation of coal briquettes is for cooking, so it seems that the Allocation Committee can still be responsible. No final decision has been made on this matter, but in principle, it will generally be handled by the Food Allocation Committee.

### "Quanhe" Supply and Marketing Cooperative Increases Allocation of Daily Necessities

In order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures plan, the National Cooperative Goods Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Ministry of Social Affairs has expanded the in-kind allocation for public education staff in order to effectively improve the lives of public education staff. In addition to the six kinds of daily necessities allocated to public education staff by the government, it plans to increase the allocation of six kinds of daily necessities such as towels, socks, shirts, and undershirts. It will be piloted in Nanjing and Shanghai first, and then promoted to other provinces and cities after it is effective. Regarding the funding, it will be passed by the Four Banks Joint Office and handled by the representative of the Central Cooperative Bank. The cotton gauze raw materials will be supplied by the China Textile Company, and production is currently being stepped up. It may be possible to first allocate and sell several items such as shirts next month. As for the allocation method, the cooperative has formulated detailed methods and will invite representatives from 11 units such as the Central Cooperative Bank and the China Textile Company to form a review committee to preside over matters such as pricing and distribution. All public education staff in Nanjing and Shanghai who are allocated firewood, rice, and other six kinds of in-kind goods can be issued a purchase certificate by the cooperative every month or every quarter to purchase goods at a specified cooperative.

### Commander Xuan Explains His Powers Again; Criticizes Parents of Arrested Students as Unwise

Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, made a statement on the matter of the families of arrested students filing an appeal with the High Court, explaining the imposition of martial law in this city. Yesterday, the families of the arrested students responded to Xuan's statement, and Xuan explained the powers of martial law again. His words are as follows: The martial law implemented by this headquarters is not the temporary martial law stipulated in Article 3 of the Martial Law Act. If it is temporary, this headquarters may announce it at any time without special approval. The procedure is only to submit it to the National Government for retroactive recognition. The beginning of martial law in this city was reported by the former headquarters to the former Military Council for approval, and the Military Council forwarded it to the National Government, which approved the implementation of martial law. More than a year has passed, and the martial law has not been lifted. Moreover, because the situation in this city is unstable and there are many incidents around, this headquarters has not considered lifting martial law in order to protect the safety of more than four million citizens. This legal and factual basis cannot be shaken by argument. As for the provision in Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Constitution that the person should be transferred to the judicial organ for trial within 24 hours at the latest, the article clearly stipulates that it only refers to the organ that executes the arrest or detention, not the organ that has the power to prosecute. Otherwise, the suspects investigated by the prosecutor must also be transferred to the criminal court within 24 hours. Moreover, the Provisional Constitution was promulgated and implemented on June 1, 1931, and the Martial Law Act was promulgated on November 29, 1934. The habeas corpus began to be implemented on March 15 of last year. If it is believed that martial law is in conflict with the Provisional Constitution, then why did the National Government promulgate laws that conflict with the Provisional Constitution that was implemented three years ago, and wait for the Habeas Corpus Act that was implemented twelve years later to remedy it? The parents' unfounded reliance on Article 84 of the Provisional Constitution as the reason for the habeas corpus is even more wrong. In short, the powers of this headquarters to investigate military personnel related to military affairs in accordance with the Martial Law Act are clearly stipulated in the law, and cannot be arbitrarily abandoned by non-military organs, let alone be required to be abandoned by the people. Moreover, after the communist party's underground work program was uncovered, it was discovered that many of the arrested elements were instigated by the communist party, shouting slogans, posting slogans everywhere, opposing conscription and grain requisition, and inciting strikes and markets. Their performance corresponded to the communist army that advocated rebellion. It is a well-known and undeniable fact. The parents are defending their children and do not hesitate to quote out of context and distort the law in an attempt to confuse the hearing. This is the most unwise thing.

### Flood Relief Association to Elect Flower Queen

The Relief Committee for the Flood in Guangdong and Guangxi has launched a fundraising campaign. It is reported that in addition to deciding to issue disaster relief lottery tickets, the committee plans to hold an election for "Flower Queen" in order to call on citizens from all walks of life to actively donate and not forget disaster relief during entertainment. It is predicted that the grand occasion at that time will be no less than the Shanghai Miss election last year.

### Cooperative Bureau Formulates Three Measures for Surplus Distribution of Cooperatives

[Our Correspondent] The annual surplus of consumer cooperatives should be distributed in proportion to the amount of transactions of the members, after deducting the public reserve fund, public welfare fund, and staff remuneration, according to regulations. The Cooperative Bureau has formulated three measures because various cooperatives often fail to comply with the regulations: (1) Establish a special register to register accounts separately. (2) An invoice should be issued for each transaction, and the calculation should be based on the saved invoices at the end of the year. (3) It should be handled with a transaction manual containing a purchase certificate, and the members should be notified in advance to save a copy. All cooperatives should refer to these measures and implement them from this year.

### Regulations for Reviewing Standards and Methods for Price Allocation of Japanese Compensation Materials

[Our Correspondent] The "Measures for Private Enterprises to Apply for Price Allocation of Japanese Compensation Materials" have been approved by the Executive Yuan and instructed the Shanghai Municipal Government to comply with them.

The specified review standards are: 1. The applicant has been experienced and successful in operating this industry. 2. The organization is sound and sufficient to be competent. 3. The plan is perfect and feasible. 4. The amount of fundraising can reach the plan. Private enterprises that meet the above items and have the following circumstances will be given priority for price allocation: 1. The applicant has suffered significant losses to the materials to be allocated and purchased during the Anti-Japanese War, and there is factual evidence to prove it. 2. The current business urgently needs replenishment and has been approved by the government. 3. This industry has made significant contributions in the rear area to the materials to be allocated and purchased of the same type of industry and mining.

### Maocheng Warehouse Fire Case; All Four Defendants Failed to Appear

[Our Correspondent] The Maocheng Company warehouse at No. 60 Nansun Road caught an unprecedented fire on the night of April 8, which lasted for three days and nights, causing great losses, especially to the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications.

The court adjourned the hearing to 10:00 a.m. on the 26th of this month for continued hearing.

### Yangsi District Health Sub-Office Transfers to Establish Epidemic First Aid Station

### Cai Miao, Charged with Double Crimes, on Trial; Vehemently Denies Joining the Communist Party

[Our Correspondent] Cai Miao, who once held a puppet military position, served as the Captain of the Third Detachment of the Second Brigade of the Songhu Vanguard Army of the Third War Zone after the victory. He later defected to the Communist Party and served as the Chief of the First Group of the Communist Party's Shanghai Communications Station. The High Procuratorate charged him with the crime of being a traitor and the crime of internal disorder. The case was tried in the High Court yesterday. The defendant admitted that he had held a puppet position, but claimed that he was engaged in underground work.

### Case of Collapsed Wall at Chongshi School: Principal Offers Two Justifications

[Report from our Newspaper] The brick wall of the side entrance of Chongshi School at 440 Huangpi South Road suddenly collapsed at 12:30 PM on June 8th, crushing Zhang Daoqing, a worker at the egg roll factory next door, to death. After the police department interrogated Shen Xibin, the school's principal, and Zhang Ding, the mother of the deceased, Shen was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on suspicion of negligence leading to death due to his failure to repair the wall. Yesterday, Shen submitted a plea to the District Prosecutor's Office, stating two reasons; (1) The Education Bureau stipulates that the school should be repaired every six months, and the school buildings were not damaged, so the responsibility to prevent danger in advance has been fulfilled. (2) The factory next door built a bamboo shed next to the school, and the wall became loose after nails were hammered into it, leading to the collapse. Therefore, the school should not be held responsible for negligence leading to death.

### Robbery with Bloodshed in Yangjiadu, Pudong: Two Shot

[Report from our Newspaper] Tian Junfa, a resident of No. 1002 Xiaopudong Road, Yangjiadu, Pudong, has been working as a foreman at the Ning Shao Wharf and earns a good monthly income. His wife, Ms. Ni, has one son and one daughter. Around 6 PM the day before yesterday, two robbers suddenly appeared, one wearing a beige raincoat and the other wearing a black cloak, pacing back and forth at the gate. Tian went out after dark, and the two robbers broke into the house, threatening with guns. As a result, they robbed a gold bracelet from Ms. Ni's hand.

Xu Wenxian and a young woman, Du Tan, rushed to the scene upon hearing the noise to help Ms. Ni capture the robber.

### Motor Vehicles Prohibited on Certain Bridges, Pedicabs Dispersed to Suburbs, Improving Traffic in Central District, Review Meeting Held

[Report from our Newspaper] A review meeting to improve traffic in the central district of the city was held in the city government conference room at 3 PM yesterday, chaired by Mayor Wu. After the Public Utilities Bureau, Police Bureau, and Public Works Bureau reported separately, the following resolutions were made on the spot:

(1) It is stipulated that a license for a motor vehicle will only be issued if there is a parking space. (2) Unlicensed pedicabs and rickshaws will be auctioned off by vehicle dealers from other places, and the proceeds will be returned to the original owners. The detailed methods will be discussed by the municipal government meeting and then submitted to the Municipal Council for approval. (3) The Shanghai Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang believes that bridge traffic is congested, and motor vehicles should be prohibited from passing through certain bridges, while rickshaws can pass through at will, to benefit the common people. Because motor vehicles are highly maneuverable and convenient, and the time and gasoline required to take detours are negligible, the above proposal was approved in principle. Now that the Shanxi Road Bridge has been repaired and the Fujian Road Bridge will also be completed, it is decided that these two bridges will be exclusively for rickshaw traffic.

Ten-Wheel Trucks to be Equipped with Iron Nets

(4) Ten-wheel trucks are most likely to cause accidents because their lower bodies are very high and there are no covers on the left and right sides. If people are knocked down and fall under the truck, there is no escape. It is decided that truck owners or users should install wire mesh on the left and right sides of the trucks as soon as possible as a barrier. It is also stipulated that vehicles without this equipment will be banned, and strict enforcement will be carried out during vehicle inspection and licensing. (5) In order to solve the traffic congestion in the central district, it is decided to draw lots to move the existing pedicabs to the suburbs. Vehicles that win the lot will be allowed to continue to operate throughout the city, but they must repaint their bodies yellow and their canopies gray within a limited time, and they will only be allowed to operate after their equipment has been inspected and approved.

Horns Used to Summon People Should be Banned

(6) Citizens are disgusted with car horns at night, so special measures are stipulated to ban them. In addition, most cars use horns as a tool to summon people, which is fundamentally wrong and should also be banned. (7) The Municipal Council previously sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau stating that parking signs have not been widely erected, causing drivers to be at a loss as to where to park, and the Cao traffic police often impose penalties, which seems unfair. It was resolved that the enforcement of traffic fines should be temporarily suspended until the signs are widely erected, but it was resolved that fines should still be imposed.

Setting up Command Platforms and Building Safety Islands

(8) On Nanjing Road from Xizang Road to the Bund, cars are not allowed to obstruct the width of the tram line between 8 AM and 6 PM every day. If they violate the regulations, they will be punished according to the traffic rules. If accidents occur, the car drivers will be fully responsible. It is decided that the Garrison Command, Military Police, and Police Bureau will each send representatives to maintain traffic order at all times. (9) In order to improve traffic congestion in the central district, it is stipulated that vehicles on north-south roads are only allowed to park facing east, and vehicles on east-west roads are only allowed to park facing south. (10) It is decided to set up fixed traffic control platforms at the following locations: (A) The intersection of the Bund and Nanjing Road, (B) The intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Henan Road, (C) The intersection of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road, (D) The intersection of Zhongshan East Road and Suzhou Road (i.e., the foot of the Waibaidu Bridge). It is decided to build a safety island at the intersection of Xizang Road and Fuzhou Road to prevent traffic confusion and obstruction of traffic order. The conference believes that most of the traffic improvement work is of a technical nature, and in order to facilitate discussions and decisions during the meeting and to make full use of expert opinions, it is decided to set up six specialized working groups to conduct regular research.

[Report from our Newspaper] Many students who were arrested in the previous student unrest have been released this week if their circumstances were minor. If any of these students are graduates, they can still obtain their graduation certificates from the school after participating in the graduation make-up exam. Those who have not graduated can obtain transcripts from the school and transfer to other schools.

Feng Jiasheng, Dean of Academic Affairs of Shanghai University, told reporters yesterday that Ling Chengyang, the president of the university, has completed his lectures in England and is scheduled to return to China in mid-August. Zhu Xirong and Xiao Minan, graduating students, and Cai Wenlong, a second-year student, who were arrested at the beginning of last month, have been released a few days ago. Zhu and Xiao are currently preparing their lessons to participate in the graduation make-up exam, and Cai will transfer to another school next semester.

Also: Among the eleven students arrested at Fudan University, the families of Meng Qingyuan, Dai Hanmin, and Chen Wangyou are not in Shanghai. The school's alumni association has asked senators Chen Baotai and Zhao Yangxiong to bail the three students in accordance with the law in their capacity as alumni, and has obtained the consent of the authorities. However, the three students are not on the first list of released students.

### Private Schools in Northeastern Shanghai Tentatively Set Tuition Standards

300,000 for Elementary School, 450,000 for Junior High

The Northeastern Shanghai Private School Presidents' Association held a full-district principals' meeting at 2 PM the day before yesterday in the auditorium of Jizhou Road Jizhong Middle School. Member schools included Shenpei, Dalu, Youheng, Nianhua, Ronghai, Sigaoli, Zhonghua Girls' Elementary School, and Qinghua, totaling 135 schools. Zhu Junti, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Liu Xunshou, Head of the Private School Section, attended the meeting and gave instructions. Wang Shiying, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by a discussion of the proposals. It was resolved that: (1) Only a few schools in the district have not yet registered with the Municipal Education Bureau. If the procedures are legal, the Education Bureau will be asked to approve the registration leniently. (2) The schools in the district are located in factory areas, and the tuition fees are extremely low. The equipment cannot be compared with general central schools. The Education Bureau will be asked to appropriately lower the equipment standards for schools in the district. (3) Currently, more and more parents are going to various schools to inquire about tuition fees for the next semester. In order to make it clear to parents, it is proposed to temporarily set the following tuition standards for the next semester: at least 300,000 yuan for elementary school, 450,000 yuan for junior high school, and 600,000 yuan for senior high school, not including textbooks and miscellaneous fees. Teachers' salaries will also be increased according to the proportion of the previous semester. (4) The Hudong branch of the National Education Cooperative was officially established last month. Please inform all teachers in the member schools to join as soon as possible.

### Many Cases of Forged Documents Discovered During National Education Certification Registration

The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau is holding a certification examination for national school teachers this year, originally planned for 5,000 people. Since the start of the process, the application forms prepared have been almost completely issued in just three days. The bureau is now rushing to print more. Distribution has been temporarily suspended from today and will resume on the 23rd. Also, many forged graduation certificates and service certificates have been submitted in the past three days. Among the more serious cases, Wang Shucheng and Sun Shuying forged the seal of the county government. There were also two people who forged the seal of the former Shanghai County Rural Normal School. Yao Jinggao, deputy director of the Certification Committee and head of the registration team, told reporters: Forging documents is a violation of criminal law and constitutes the crime of forging official documents, with a minimum sentence of one year. However, in consideration of the first offense, we will not pursue the matter. If it is discovered again in the future, it will definitely be transferred to the judicial authorities for handling in accordance with the law. If anyone has submitted forged documents, we hope that they will confess themselves immediately and they will be treated leniently.

### Textbook Shortage Extremely Serious

National Standard Textbooks Proposed to be Abolished

[Dahua News Agency] Since the copyright of national standard textbooks was opened, many houses have requested to print them, but in fact, almost none have submitted samples and published books. Several book industry typesetting joint ventures in Shanghai are said to have invested a total of only 600 million yuan, which is like a drop in the bucket compared to the total national demand of 100 billion yuan, and cannot actually help. Moreover, there are no branches in various places, making it even more difficult to supply them in abundance. Those with a shortage of funds have collected deposit fees at low prices, stipulating that the books will be delivered in early this month, but due to the soaring prices of raw materials and printing, the funds have long been used for other purposes. Therefore, the books cannot be delivered on time, and disputes have arisen repeatedly. Local governments are frantically inquiring with Nanjing and Shanghai about what is going on. In the market, except for Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, World, Datong, Kaiming, Jiaotong, Children's, Chinese Culture, Independent, Victory and other eleven companies, which continue to supply a considerable quantity, other versions are only seen in advertisements, and are rarely found in reality. The textbook shortage this autumn will inevitably be extremely serious.

[Another News] According to a certain educator: No matter how revised, national standard textbooks are ultimately deemed to be outdated and unusable. The institutions that are currently printing these national standard textbooks are unrestricted. Individuals, groups, institutions, and ordinary printing houses, regardless of whether they have storefronts or distribution centers in various places, can apply for printing, as if it were a perpetual calendar that everyone can print. This is a case of everyone following suit, causing extreme disruption. The quantity cannot be estimated, and the distribution network cannot be widespread. At a time when the country is poor and the people are distressed, it seems inappropriate to take such an "annoying" and wasteful action. It would be more reasonable to abolish these national standard textbooks that only cause disruption as soon as possible and allow bookstores to freely print approved versions.

Li, Ju, and Zhang showed their prowess, returning the favor in kind, tying the score at 3-3. In the final match, no one from Shanghai Star was able to play, so they forfeited.

Haiying's right to compete should be revoked, Xinsheng's protest is upheld, and the deposit is returned.

(2) The Post Office Team B basketball team of Group B expressed dissatisfaction with the game after the finals against Xianshi, but since no protest was filed according to the rules and false advertisements were published, which violated the spirit of sportsmanship, a warning should be issued.

Xianshi — (Pingguang (Replay) 6:15 PM

### Dong Shouyi's Trip to Europe

Hao Gengsheng and Wu Yunrui Requested to Submit a Report

[Guoguang News Agency, Nanjing] It has been learned that Mr. Dong Shouyi, China's representative to the Olympic World Sports Committee meeting in Sweden, has flown from England to Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. The sports community is shocked that Dong requested that the 1956 World Games be held in Beiping, China. The All-China Sports Federation believes that this matter is of great importance. Executive Directors Wu Yunrui and Hao Gengsheng and others have jointly sent a letter to Dong. A reporter from Guoguang News Agency obtained a copy of the original letter, which is recorded below:

Dong's Trip to Europe: No Resolution from the Council

"Brother Shouyi, greetings: This time you went to Europe to attend the preparatory meeting of the World Games in the name of representing the All-China Sports Federation, but in reality, you represent the Republic of China, which is of great importance. However, the decision to go was made entirely through private agreement between individuals, without any basis in the resolution of the Council meeting. This is ridiculous. If the people of the country were to learn of this inside story, not only would the members of the Council of the Sports Federation be criticized, but you personally would also be despised by the people of the country. We feel that this matter is inappropriate and dare not remain silent. We hereby ask you to pay attention to this matter and convene a Council meeting as soon as possible to report on the situation and results of your attendance in order to remedy the situation. This matter concerns the All-China Sports Federation and your personal future. Please pay attention to it. Best wishes, Hao Gengsheng and Wu Yunrui, together."

### Implementation Plan for Regulating the Gauze Market: Submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for Approval Today

Establish Guangzhou Office to Eliminate Gauze Smuggling

[This newspaper reported] The sixth regular meeting of the Textile Regulation Committee was held at the committee's conference room yesterday afternoon from 4:30 PM. Deputy Chairman Liu Siying and ten other people attended, and the meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM. The main points of the discussion are recorded as follows:

Deputy Chairman Liu will take them to Beijing today and submit them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval before being announced and implemented. (2) In order to completely eliminate the smuggling of gauze to Nanyang, the committee decided to first establish a branch office in Guangzhou.

It was also decided to first send personnel to the Guangzhou area to inspect the production, sales, and smuggling situation of gauze in the area. (3) The replication industry in this city requested to improve the current method of allocating yarn. After discussion, it was considered that the method of allocating yarn to the replication industry in this city does need to be improved, and the yarn allocation of the replication industry in other places also needs to be considered.

(4) The Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District requested to improve the grading standards for cotton yarn purchases. According to the current standards, there are five grades: A, B, C, D, and E. Only those classified as Grade A are considered qualified, and the standard seems to be too high.

It was decided to transfer it to the committee's technical office to discuss with the Sixth District Association for handling. (5) Regarding the negotiated price of cotton yarn, it was decided not to adjust it in the short term.

Finally, according to Deputy Chairman Liu to reporters: Regarding the allocation of yarn to distributors, there are clear regulations in the implementation plan for gauze regulation, and it is also intended to allocate according to the plan. It can be implemented once it is approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

### Chinese Stocks Oversupply: Market Transactions Sharply Reduced

Chinese stocks yesterday, Meiya replaced Yongsai, followed by Xinhuo and Jingfu. Off-site credit is still tight, and those active outside the industry are unable to move forward. People within the industry are gradually disappointed and are closing out their positions, forming an oversupply. Spot market sentiment is depressed, and transactions are sharply reduced. Swap arbitrage is decreasing, and it is difficult for the banking sector to find counterparts for funds. The interest rate has been reduced to less than 1.2%, half the rate of the off-site black market. People's hearts are not encouraged. Except for miscellaneous brands, underwear, and semi-cooked French Xinhua, which saw a slight increase, all stocks were generally unhappy. Xinhuo's current and forward prices fell to the limit, and Shangwu Cement also stopped falling, making the overall situation difficult to be optimistic about.

The opening in the morning was still stable. The forward Meiya opened high to 620 yuan, a difference of as much as 50 yuan from the spot Meiya, which attracted arbitrageurs to increase supply. This forced the spot and forward Meiya down to 565 yuan and 588 yuan. No. 231 and No. 146 sold the spot and forward Xinhuo, which also fell to 3680 yuan and 3850 yuan. At 9:30 AM, No. 35, No. 97, and No. 223 came in to buy Meiya, and No. 185 and No. 152 came in to buy Xinhuo, and there was a rebound. Shangwu was first listed low to the limit by No. 142 Shoughuag at 9:40 AM, and No. 89, No. 69, No. 4, No. 224 still sold, and finally it was unsustainable. After 10:00 AM, it was heard that the investigation of walkie-talkies in the building became stricter, and people were very afraid. Meiya was forced down to 520 yuan (spot) and 546 yuan (forward), a low price. Xinhuo fell to 3500 yuan, the limit of the fall. At 10:20 AM, No. 197, No. 226, No. 106, and No. 14 bought in at low prices. Meiya rebounded to around 545 yuan and 565 yuan, and Cement was listed by No. 149 to the limit of the fall.

At 12:00 PM, Meiya rebounded to around 557 yuan and 578 yuan, and Xinhuo rebounded to above 5700 yuan and 5600 yuan. Forward Xinguang rose to 205 yuan, and Jingfu rose to above 172 yuan. No. 224, No. 157, No. 97, and No. 235 sold Meiya, No. 163 sold Xinhuo, No. 112 sold Xinguang, and all three popular stocks had a small decline and ended in a flat market. However, the forward Meiya closed as high as 572 yuan. No. 223 and others closed out, and there was a slight shout down after the close. The remaining stocks were still relatively stable. The result was that the spot stock Xinhuo fell to the limit and then rebounded, falling by less than half. Huafeng fell by a weak 10%, and Xinguang, Jingfu, Meiya, Dongxing, and Yonggong each fell by about 5%. Zhongfa Xinhua still had a slight increase, Guohuo Lian was the only one that was flat, underwear rose by a weak 50%, Shangwu Cement fell to the limit and then rebounded, the former fell by a weak 50%, the latter fell by less than half, and the rest had slight declines. Forward stocks fell by a strong 50% after Xinhuo fell to the limit and rebounded, Huafeng fell by 50%, and Xinguang and Yonggong Jingfu fell slightly. Meiya was the only one that was flat, and Qinxing fell by a strong 50%. Off-site old stocks Nanyang Zhonghua Wuzhou rebounded slightly by half, and the rest were flat and tired.

Arbitrage Trading Concentrated in Meiya

Arbitrage trading yesterday was concentrated in Meiya. The premium continued to deteriorate, and the spot market lacked activity. Banks were unable to find a way out. No. 2207, No. 110, No. 181, No. 45, and No. 155 and others bought in, and Meiya fell from 25 yuan to 14 yuan at the close. The interest rate fell from 1.9% to around 1.1%.

### Export Tax Problem Solved for Silk Fabrics Intended for India

[Central News Agency, this city] China's silk production cannot match overseas market prices in terms of cost, resulting in sluggish sales. Since Hugh White, a silk expert from the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group, conducted inspections in various regions, he has drafted a plan to recommend that the authorities develop new avenues for raw materials, weaving silk fabrics, and promote them to India to compete for overseas sales of Chinese silk fabrics. At the same time, labor fees can also be exchanged for foreign exchange. The relevant departments organized a silk weaving management and guidance committee to be responsible for supervision. Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales Joint Company jointly with various silk weaving factories obtained 2,200 dan of raw silk and 2,400 boxes of rayon from China Trust Bureau in accordance with the prescribed procedures, and started weaving silk fabrics for export. It is expected that 110,000 pieces of silk fabrics for export can be produced by the end of August. According to the current overseas market price, the total value can reach 6 million US dollars. According to the cost of living index, the estimated labor cost is 60 billion national currency. As of the end of last month, 62,000 pieces of finished products have been shipped to Mumbai. The reason for the delayed transaction is that our side insisted on paying taxes based on the export valuation, while the other side insisted on paying taxes based on the local market price. After further negotiations, a compromise was reached. The first three batches of goods will be taxed entirely according to our country's export valuation, and the rest will be valued according to the local market price. This news was reported here yesterday by our representative in India.

### Textile Construction Plans to Manufacture Jute Bags: Monthly Output of Approximately 200,000 Bags

### Steel Ball Bearing Manufacturing Plant: Request for Details on Japanese Machinery

[This newspaper read] The preparatory work for the Joint Steel Ball Bearing Manufacturing Plant, which plans to use Japanese reparations equipment, is actively underway. Recently, the convener of the plant submitted a document to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, stating that the manufacture of steel ball bearings is very complicated, and the equipment of machine tools is different from ordinary machines. The manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States and Japan are different. The Japanese reparations equipment list in the past only included the quantity of machines, without specifying their parts, performance, and working procedures; therefore, four requests were specially made and transferred to the delegation in Japan for handling: (1) The name of the machine to be dismantled, the weight of each machine, and the horsepower required. (2) Whether there is any damage to all machines to be dismantled. (3) The layout of the original factory and plant in Japan for the bearing factory should be immediately displayed. (4) The name of the products produced by the factory in the past and the maximum production capacity, and the working procedures adopted. In addition to these four requests, it is hoped that personnel will be sent to Japan for on-site inspections.

### Deadline for Purchasing Cased Tea: Approved for Extension by Five Days

In the case of the tea loan in the 35th year of the Republic of China, the method of handling the pledged cased tea was that the Four Joint Offices previously stated that tea merchants borrowed money from national banks and bureaus to purchase tea and pledge it for nearly a year. The board of directors has now decided that China Trust Bureau will purchase all of the tea based on the domestic tea prices proposed by the tea merchants, with a deadline of July 20. Now the tea merchants have requested to increase the purchase price. The department has now submitted a proposal for discussion. It is generally believed that the government's assistance to tea merchants in purchasing, transporting, and selling tea has given the tea merchants the greatest convenience. The amount of the past pledge loans has been repeatedly increased, and the tea merchants have already recovered their capital. The currently set purchase price is also based on the requests made by the tea merchants in May. This time, they have repeatedly requested to increase the price, which is excessive. It was decided yesterday that the request could not be granted, but the deadline for purchase was extended to July 25.

### Rayon Factory: Too Much Capital Required, Construction Quite Difficult

[This newspaper reported] According to the person in charge of the Rayon Association in this city, it is quite difficult for our country to build a rayon factory by itself because too much capital is required. For example, building a factory with a daily output of ten tons of rayon requires a capital of ten million US dollars. When a representative of a major US rayon factory came to Shanghai a month ago, they discussed the matter of building a factory in China with a certain industrial magnate in our country. The terms of cooperation were that the US party would supply the equipment, and the Chinese businessmen would raise five million US dollars as construction costs and working capital. Due to practical difficulties, it was not fully negotiated. In the past, Japan had a rayon factory in Andong, with a monthly output of 25 tons. The Textile Construction Company originally planned to move this factory south and start work in Shanghai in July. However, the situation in Northeast China changed several times, and the factory suffered heavy losses. In the end, only 15 trucks of equipment were transported out, so this relocation plan has become a pipe dream. Taking this city's rayon market as an example, when the Qianlun is scheduled, it will bring back more than 1,000 boxes of rayon. The current market price has fallen slightly, and the selling price per box is about 27 million yuan. In the future, after Japan's trade is opened, there will be more sources, and the price may fall. Before the war, the selling price of rayon per box was about 120 yuan, and the city's monthly demand at that time was about 8,000 boxes. At the end of last year, the rayon price was about 3 million per box, and the city's demand was about 4,000 boxes. Now the selling price has approached 30 million, and the demand has been reduced to about 2,000 boxes per month.

### More Than 10,000 Tons of Coal from Qinhuangdao Arrive in Shanghai

The Fuel Committee recently dispatched the giant ships Tangshan and Hange Maler to Qinhuangdao to load coal, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The amount of coal loaded by each ship was very large. It is estimated that the Tangshan carried 7,000 tons of lump coal, and the Hange Maler carried 7,300 tons of coal dust. After unloading the goods within a few days, the two ships will continue to transport coal to Qinhuangdao. In addition, a large amount of coal from the Keelung coal mine in Taiwan will also be transported to Shanghai, and the committee has sent ships to load it.

### Yarn and Cloth All Stop Falling and Rebound

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was still weak at the opening, but because the overnight price fell too much, credit became loose, the market was in a buying mood, and there was active buying. The market turned from weak to strong. As a result, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix rose by 1 million yuan, to 18.2 million yuan, because there were more transactions, Double Horse 20-count was 11.8 million, up 600,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn also rose by 800,000 yuan, to 10.8 million yuan. Other thick and thin yarns, such as 42-count Bao Guang Shui Yue, 40-count Jincheng, 32-count Blue Phoenix, 20-count Big Woman Bell, 16-count Guangming Red Bee, and 10-count Italian Zi Jun, also rebounded by 400,000 to 1 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market also saw easing credit, and retail investors and industry insiders bought in at low prices. Buyers also placed orders to supplement their inventory, and the market stopped falling and rebounded. As a result of the closing, the price of 12-pound Dragon Head cloth rose by 10,000 yuan compared with the previous day, to 428,000 yuan. Various grades of fine cloth, such as Five Blessings Color Ball, Blue Chicken, and Yang Crane, also rose by 7,000 to 10,000 yuan. The demand for Four Gentlemen and Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance fabrics was quite strong, and the price rose by 10,000 to 16,000 yuan. The remaining raw cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth remained at the original price.

### Woolen Fabrics Sales Are Sluggish

The woolen fabric market is still strong internally and externally, except for summer goods. Most of them are moving towards their peak. However, the turnover is very sluggish, because those with strength have already absorbed a considerable amount in the previous two weeks. The prices of autumn and winter woolen fabrics continue to rise, increasing the cost, and those who want to purchase are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude.

### Reasons for the Surge in Prices of Tallow, a Major Soap Raw Material

Recently, the price of tallow, a major raw material for soap and candles, has risen sharply, significantly impacting the cost of soap production. Yesterday, a reporter visited authoritative figures in the industry, who said that the main production areas of tallow are Hankou, Jingzhou, Lanxi, and Jiaxing, with Hankou being the largest distribution center. In the past month, the amount of tallow shipped from various production areas to Shanghai has been extremely small because the inventory in the production areas is also becoming increasingly scarce. Furthermore, large soap factories in Shanghai with greater financial resources are also going to the production areas to purchase directly, which has also made local tallow prices very buoyant. Currently, Hankou tallow is priced at 1.4 million yuan per picul (司馬担), which is comparable to prices in Shanghai. Moreover, daily telegrams continue to report rising prices. Shanghai tallow merchants believe that with Shanghai and production area prices being equal, the high transportation costs, and the high exchange rate in Hankou, they are unwilling to go to purchase tallow without any profit to be made. Additionally, due to the hot weather, the demand for soap in the Shanghai market is relatively strong, and many factories have increased production, so tallow sales are indeed booming. In this situation of supply falling short of demand, rising prices are inevitable, which is completely opposite to the phenomenon of oversupply and falling prices this spring. They also stated that although the asking price for tallow has been high recently, the market transactions have been very limited, and the thinness of funds in the market is the main reason. Even those holding inventory are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, as new tallow will not be available until after autumn.

### Rice Prices, Initially Firm, Then Level; Slight Rise in High-Quality White Indica Rice

Yesterday, the North and South markets received more than 7,000 shih (石) of rice. The market conditions were firm in the morning and leveled off in the afternoon. High-quality japonica and indica rice slightly rose by 3000 to 5000 yuan, while medium and low-quality rice remained stable. There was little change in white rice.

After continuous declines, wheat flour rebounded by 2000 to 3000 yuan, but the market was still sluggish at the close, and the momentum for further increases appeared weak. Oil cakes and miscellaneous grains declined across the board. Soybean cakes were selling very slowly and continued to fall by 2000 to 3000 yuan. Yingkou cakes also fell by 3000 to 4000 yuan. Wheat bran fell by 1000 to 2000 yuan. Soybean sales were stagnant, and prices fell again by 5000 to 10000 yuan. Southern soybeans were weak and gradually declined, dropping by 10000 yuan. Raw peanuts continued to decline, falling another 10000 yuan. Sesame sales were also sluggish, and prices continued to plummet by 10000 to 20000 yuan.

Corn from Northern ports has ceased trading, falling back by 3000 to 5000 yuan. Broad beans had sluggish sales, showing signs of decline, and fell by another 2000 to 3000 yuan. Field peas were stable. The oil market declined in a straight line. Soybean oil fell again by 10000 to 20000 yuan, sesame oil fell sharply by 30000 to 40000 yuan, rapeseed oil plummeted by 30000 to 40000 yuan, and clear oil also fell by 20000 to 30000 yuan. Raw oil also fell by slightly under 10000 yuan. With trading from other ports suspended, the local market is still difficult to be optimistic about.

### Argentine Rice Grain Temporarily Cannot Be Shipped to China

[Our Newspaper News] He Molin, manager of the Materials Exchange Office of the Central Trust Bureau, went to Argentina at the beginning of this year to assist the Chinese Embassy in Argentina in negotiating trade barter between China and Argentina. He has now returned to Shanghai after six months. It is reported that the China-Argentina trade was originally intended to take the form of barter trade, but the Argentine government hopes to increase exports, especially rice and grain exports. Currently, an agreement on prices has not yet been reached, so Argentine rice cannot be shipped to China for the time being. In addition, on his way back to China, Mr. He inspected the bureau's procurement operations in the United States. The general impression is that it was quite good.

### Green Tea Exports Are Sluggish

Yesterday, the foreign tea market for green teas such as Chun Zhen and Zhen Mei remained sluggish due to imbalanced inventory adjustments. However, Wuchang Tea Company continued to absorb Qimen old tea and low-grade black tea, and the trend was driven by sellers' intentions, with consistent vigor. For various domestic sales, although local shops and traveling merchants had some interest, they were all waiting and watching due to the influence of the Ming Ying compilation, and the number of transactions sharply decreased, but the situation was still stable. According to industry insiders, new Qimen black tea for this year has recently arrived from the Anhui Tea Company, etc., but because the production cost is very high, the asking price is staggering, reportedly reaching around 3 million yuan per dan, and it is still unknown whether it can be sold smoothly.

Furthermore, the Tianxiang Foreign Company's Tei Hai Lan Tai ship, carrying more than 220 tons of tea, and the Baohe Dehang's Laukesmi ship, carrying more than 200 tons, both left Shanghai yesterday for Europe.

### Export Promotion Committee Discusses Silk and Tea Export Issues

[Our Newspaper News] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held consecutive meetings on the 15th and 16th, chaired by Chen Guangfu, to study the export issues of tea and raw silk in detail. Although several conclusions have been reached in principle, the technical implementation issues still need to be further planned, so no resolution was made immediately. As for the improvement measures for the purchase of tung oil and pig bristles, they are currently being submitted to the Bristle Subcommittee of the committee for research at the request of various exporters. It is said that improvements are expected in the purchase method and price.

### Musk Cannot Be Exported; Domestic and Foreign Prices Are Inverted

Musk from Kang and Shu provinces is generally bartered for rice and tea locally. However, recently, affected by the sharp rise in rice and tea prices in the local area, the purchase price of musk has also gradually increased. Musk from Kang Province was once sold well in countries such as Britain and France, while musk from Shu Province was only sold to the domestic medicinal materials industry. Therefore, there are fewer buyers for the latter. It is said that there is quite a lot of musk arriving in Shanghai currently, but it cannot be exported because the difference between domestic and foreign market prices is too large. Currently, the selling price is about 8 million yuan per catty, while the recent foreign market price is less than 3.5 million yuan.

### Import and Export Committees to Be Considered for Merger by the National Economic Council

The National Economic Council is currently considering merging the Import Control Committee and the Export Promotion Committee. Since their establishment, the two committees have made remarkable achievements in promoting China's international trade. The National Economic Council intends to strengthen the connection and effectiveness of import and export, so it has the intention to merge them.

### Representatives Designated for Various Units of the South China Import and Export Committee

[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that since the South China Import and Export Management Committee was approved for establishment, it has been actively preparing and has now formed ten units. The representatives of each unit have also been designated and are expected to be formally established soon.

Raw Pencil Leads Still Permitted for Import

[Our Newspaper News] Major pencil manufacturers in Shanghai previously requested the Non-Quota Allocation Office of the Import Control Committee to allow the import of special pencils made abroad, which cannot be manufactured domestically. It is now learned that the request has been rejected. However, it is said that raw pencil leads are still permitted to be imported as usual.

### Match Industry Lacks Raw Materials

Proposed Request to Import Control Committee to Increase Import Volume

[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that the match industry in Shanghai is currently feeling the crisis of a lack of raw materials deeply. The main raw materials for matches are red phosphorus and potassium chlorate, which are listed as Class II chemicals in the list of commodities under import control. However, the import quota for chemical raw materials in the first quarter of this year was only 800,000 US dollars, and only over 7,000 US dollars were allocated for the above two raw materials. Among this amount, part needs to be allocated to chemical raw material merchants, so the number that manufacturers can obtain is very small. Although the Ordnance Department of our country can self-produce red phosphorus and potassium chlorate, its own needs are very large and it has no surplus capacity to supply civilian factories. The total amount of raw materials required by the match factories in Shanghai for the whole year is about 4 million US dollars, and the current quota is far from the actual needs, so except for a few large factories with particularly large inventories, most match factories cannot maximize their production capacity. It is now reported that the match industry plans to negotiate with the Import Control Committee to remove these two essential raw materials from the list of Class II chemicals, so that the import volume can be increased to meet the legitimate needs of various factories. In addition to the lack of raw materials, the increase in wages also makes manufacturers feel heavily burdened. In terms of sales, there are no imported goods, and relief supplies are rarely seen in the market. In the past, the domestic sales market in South China was supplied by Shanghai, but recently matches from Guangdong have been found in the market, although not in large quantities. The main reason for the sales from South to North is that raw materials are easier to obtain in South China, so the cost is lower than in Shanghai.

### Cigarette Market Firm

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with firm sentiment, and asking prices immediately showed strength. Rumors of advantageous buying circulated in the market, and demand from all sides was strong. It was also rumored that the Yi Zhong Company would stop distributing goods before the tax increase, and the amount of inventory on the market was insufficient. There were more buyers than sellers, and the market sentiment soared. As a result, ten boxes of British American Tobacco cigarettes rose by 260,000 yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 8.7 million yuan. Old Gold also continued to rise by 170,000 yuan, reaching 7.55 million yuan. Among Chinese cigarettes, the sales of the Beauty brand were relatively strong, with each carton rising by a huge 3,700 yuan. Other brands such as Golden Mouse, Crest, Three Cats, Bank, and Brandy mostly followed suit, rising by 300 to 1,300 yuan. However, American goods such as Camel, Six, Morris, and tin-packaged cigarettes remained stable.

### Fir Wood Firm and Stable

Yesterday, the fir wood market was slightly firm and stable. Large pieces were difficult to obtain at 2,700 yuan. The foreign pine market showed signs of weakness.

### Towel, Blanket, and Other Industries Call For Restrictions on Cotton Textile Imports

In mid-next month, Japan will open up foreign trade and ship large quantities of manufactured industrial products to our country. People in our industrial sector have unanimously expressed their opposition, and the Import Control Committee has stated that materials outside of quotas are absolutely prohibited from being imported. However, the Shanghai Towel, Blanket, and Cotton Textile Industries Associations believe that the current import and export trade interim measures Appendix 4 only lists silk fabrics as prohibited imports and does not list cotton fabrics. Therefore, according to this regulation of the Import Control Committee, Japanese cotton fabrics may still be dumped in China. Judging from the current domestic cotton textile production situation, there is a surplus in addition to self-sufficiency, which can be shipped to the South Seas Islands without relying on foreign goods. Moreover, in terms of the post-war monetary system, Japan's degree of currency inflation is far less than that of our country, so both labor and material costs are cheaper than in our country. Once a large amount of dumping occurs, it will be difficult to resist. Our towel and blanket industry will have no room for survival, and hundreds of thousands of workers will face unemployment. Therefore, the associations have jointly appealed to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that cotton products be added to the list of prohibited imports to prevent Japanese dumping.

### Science and Superstition Are Mutually Exclusive

— Bing Li

Before the Dragon Boat Festival, someone wrote to suggest: Imitating the method of designating "Qingming Festival" as "Arbor Day" the year before, they also advocated designating the fifth day of the fifth lunar month as "Epidemic Prevention Day." The reasons were three: First, every family in the mainland must paste a "Talisman for Expelling Plague and Preventing Epidemics" sent from the City God Temple on the main beam of the house on May 5th. This is tantamount to reminding people to pay attention to summer hygiene; otherwise, they are prone to being infected by the plague and becoming ill. If we put aside superstitious beliefs in gods and ghosts, pasting it on the house can be regarded as a warning sign like morning bells and evening drums. Second, there are many seasonal activities on the Dragon Boat Festival, such as pouring realgar wine, which is tantamount to spraying disinfectant; burning Atractylodes lancea and Angelica dahurica, which is tantamount to vaporizing disinfectant; and hanging mugwort leaves, Acorus gramineus, and garlic in front of windows and doorways, which is tantamount to spatial disinfection using volatile agents. These all contain the meaning of indoor disinfection; why don't we promote them and use the existing customs to promote science? Third, seasonal measures are more likely to arouse the interest of the general public compared to all new designs and new initiatives; it will definitely be of great help to the health authorities in implementing policies!

The words are not bad; but the fact is not so. Because old customs contain very strong traditional superstition. Superstition is the enemy of science. Trying to reconcile superstition and science; many people have tried this attempt before, and have repeatedly failed. There is no need to repeat the mistakes in the future, so as not to waste manpower and resources! Starting with summer hygiene: The prevalence of summer diseases is well known to everyone, regardless of age. And the occurrence of the disease is unexpected, and it is also obvious to everyone. It is an indisputable and iron-like fact; but to explain the causes of the disease, not due to the mischief of ghosts and gods, but due to the high temperature and the activity of many seasonal microorganisms; I am afraid no one will easily understand! Then how can we use the old Dragon Boat Festival customs to promote science? In short, science and superstition cannot coexist. To guide science, we must get rid of superstition! Not only those who generally believe that there are plague gods in the world, we must make them understand that the "plague gods" referred to by the ancients are actually the summer sun (referring to heatstroke; that is, what is commonly known as "fasha"; that is, what science calls sunstroke and heatstroke). Those who believe that there are epidemic ghosts in society, we must let them know that the epidemic ghosts referred to by the ancients are actually bacteria (referring to cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery) and protozoa (referring to malaria and relapsing fever); which is impossible in fact! Taking a step back, teaching people to recognize that the five poisons referred to by the ancients may not immediately cause people to become ill; but the five kinds of small creatures that everyone has always considered non-toxic, such as flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches, bedbugs, fleas, etc., can often be sufficient to transmit diseases; I am afraid it is not easy! Then, on the Dragon Boat Festival, teaching people not to pour realgar wine, but to pour DDT; not to burn Atractylodes lancea and Angelica dahurica, but to burn sulfur; not to hang mugwort and Acorus gramineus, but to hang deodorizers like those used in modern toilets (commonly known as mothballs); is it feasible? If it doesn't work, then what is the meaning of changing the Dragon Boat Festival to "Epidemic Prevention Day"?

In my humble opinion, education is not universal, and people's wisdom is difficult to enlighten! This is a major prerequisite. If the general level of knowledge of the general public gradually improves, superstition will be defeated without attack; and science will penetrate people's hearts without promotion. But can the education problem be solved overnight? Just like the general public in the current society, have they all undergone modern scientific education? Recently, I saw a letter published in a major newspaper advocating that public vehicles should be disinfected. In particular, rickshaws often carry seriously ill people, which is considered to have a risk of infection; therefore, a request for urgent disinfection was put forward. This proposition is certainly reasonable and deserves everyone's sympathy. However, the article also mentioned that passengers should know how to protect themselves, that is, teaching people to bring Bagua pills when going out. When riding a rickshaw, it is better to hold a corner in your mouth. I really don't know if this article is a disguised advertisement for promoting Bagua pills? If the author is indeed sincere and earnestly promoting hygiene, then the level of scientific knowledge cultivation in advocating that holding Bagua pills in the mouth can prevent infectious diseases can be imagined! I think this person may already know that when going out in summer, you should wear a hat and carry an umbrella to avoid strong sunlight. Also, you should get vaccinations to enhance your resistance to cholera and typhoid fever, so as to avoid accidental infection. However, this article does not mention a single word about this; instead, it mentions holding Bagua pills in the mouth. Isn't it like wishful thinking? The difference is probably due to the superstitious misunderstanding of the five elements and six qi of traditional Chinese medicine; believing that Bagua pills can support righteousness and ward off evil spirits!

From this point of view, it is certainly not right to be superstitious about divine power, but is it right to be superstitious about unscientific old sayings? In short, science and superstition cannot coexist. What we should strive for in the future is that the road ahead is arduous and difficult to measure!

### Preventing Cholera!

— Yu Zhengxing

Recently, rumors of the discovery of true cholera have often spread in Beijing and Shanghai. This terrible rumor is tantamount to a death sentence for people who are nervous. Many people feel inexplicable anxiety, and many people shake their heads and sigh, lamenting that the world is no longer ancient, and that natural disasters and man-made disasters are coming down together.

Cholera is an acute infectious disease in summer. It spreads rapidly and widely. It can kill people in a few hours, and many people suffer from it. In 1854, the cholera mortality rate in London rose to 220 per 10,000 people. In 1892, the cholera in Hamburg, Germany, affected 640,000 people. From August 17th to October 23rd, more than 17,001 people were infected, and 8,605 people died from the epidemic. On the most serious day, 1,000 people contracted cholera. The situation of cholera epidemic in our country is also very terrible. It was rampant during the Yellow River flood in 1932, the epidemic in 1936, the widespread epidemic in 1939, the epidemic again in 1942, and the widespread epidemic in 1945, which spread throughout the country. There are no accurate statistics available for reference on its mortality and patients. Last year, the cholera epidemic affected 54,197 people, and 15,460 people died, with a mortality rate of 28.53%. From May 23rd to the end of August, 4,243 confirmed cholera patients were identified in Shanghai, with 3,348 deaths. If we include the unconfirmed suspected cases, the number reaches 11,837, and there are naturally many omissions. However, this huge number is enough to show the rampant spread and terrible invasion of cholera. These many innocent victims are still in people's memory.

Cholera is a special acute gastrointestinal infectious disease. The disease progresses very quickly, with vomiting and diarrhea as the main symptoms, as well as collapse, cramps, general weakness, cold hands and feet, thirst, and coma. Because patients often vomit and have diarrhea, they lose a lot of water. The eyes and fingers are often sunken. The vomit is like fruit juice, and the pathogen of this disease—Vibrio cholerae—can be detected.

There are many cholera bacteria in the patient's stool and vomit. If this bacterium is transmitted to the gastrointestinal tract of another person, if this person's body has no resistance to Vibrio cholerae, cholera will occur in as little as a few hours and as long as three to five days. As for the route through which this bacterium invades the human body, there are probably the following ways:

1. Hands: Cholera is transmitted through hands because the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients will contaminate the patient's body, clothes, bedding, and other items. Therefore, touching the body of cholera patients or their clothes, bedding, utensils, or even using manure to water vegetables, or using hands to swat flies lying on the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients, can all cause hands to be contaminated with cholera bacteria. Before eating, if you have not washed your hands, this is a very easy opportunity for transmission.

2. Water: Cholera is transmitted through water because the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients are arbitrarily discharged without treatment and seep into the water. If you drink this contaminated water or eat food made with this sewage, you can contract cholera.

3. Flies: Cholera is transmitted by flies because flies like to burrow in dirty places. Therefore, it is very easy for them to stick cholera bacteria on their bodies because they have burrowed through the vomit and diarrhea of cholera patients. When they fly to food, they will send these bacteria into our food, and we can get cholera by eating these foods.

Remember, cholera is transmitted orally. In addition to the patient themselves, the source of the pathogen can also come from "carriers." So-called carriers are people who are not sick themselves, but carry pathogens in their bodies. People who have just recovered from cholera still have cholera bacteria in their feces, and these are carriers. There are also people who are not sick themselves, but often excrete cholera bacteria in their feces. People who come into contact with patients may also be temporary carriers, and they can spread cholera bacteria to healthy people.

Now that we know how cholera is transmitted to people, we know how to prevent and control cholera. Cholera is a summer infectious disease transmitted orally. If we eradicate the source of the disease and cut off the transmission route, we can naturally prevent and control it. Now, let's try to explain it in two aspects:

(1) Personal aspect

First, we should develop the habit of washing our hands before meals and not putting things into our mouths with our hands. Because our hands will come into contact with various things at any time, we don't know when we will accidentally touch things contaminated with the vomit of cholera patients. Therefore, washing hands frequently and not putting things into the mouth is a proper prevention method. In addition, pay attention not to get close to patients, and pay attention to disinfection after getting close.

Second, boil all drinking water, such as water used for drinking, washing, washing dishes, and food utensils. The water source should also be properly protected and disinfected when drinking to prevent cholera bacteria from surviving.

Third, prevent the breeding of flies, use gauze covers in kitchens and canteens, naturally and effectively improve environmental sanitation, and properly dispose of feces.

Fourth, do not eat raw or cold food, do not drink raw water, do not eat melons and fruits sold by street vendors, do not use raw water to rinse your mouth and brush your teeth, and do not overeat. These are all simple and easy-to-implement important methods.

Fifth, increase the human body's resistance to cholera by injecting cholera vaccine once a year. But please note that if there are symptoms of chills, fever, redness, and swelling after the injection, it doesn't matter and there is no harm. Vaccination does have immunity, which can last for three to six months, but this is not foolproof. If a large number of cholera bacteria enter the stomach, you will still get sick, but the illness will be much milder. Therefore, you must also be careful about your diet after getting a vaccination.

(2) Public aspect

First, if a suspected cholera patient is found, report it to the health authorities immediately to diagnose whether it is a true cholera patient. If it is a true cholera patient, the patient should be isolated immediately so that they do not come into contact with healthy people. The patient's feces and vomit should be thoroughly disinfected immediately. All items used by the patient or all of their belongings must be disinfected. The food left over by the patient should be burned. Second, people who have been in close contact with the patient should be quarantined for five days from the last possible day of contact. If there are cholera bacteria in the stool, the time should be extended. Contacts should also be immunized immediately.

Third, search for unreported cases and carriers, and investigate whether it may be transmitted by dirty drinking water or by contaminated but uncooked food in order to eradicate the source of infection.

Fourth, caregivers should strictly implement personal prevention, pay close attention to cleanliness, and disinfect their hands after each time they serve the patient or come into contact with vomit and contaminated objects. Avoid eating or drinking any food in the patient's room, or taking food out of the sickroom, and prohibit caregivers from entering the kitchen.

Fifth, in cholera-stricken areas, only cooked food is allowed to be eaten. After the food and drink are cooked or cooked, prevent flies and others from touching and contaminating them.

Cholera can indeed be prevented and eradicated. In European and American countries with advanced sanitation, the word "cholera" is already a noun in the dictionary and no longer as rampant and deadly as it is in our country. Before cholera is discovered, pay close attention to preventing its occurrence. This work is the common responsibility of the people and the health authorities. Efforts from either side alone will not succeed. I hope that citizens will pay close attention to summer hygiene and work hard on personal hygiene. I also hope that the health authorities will make a comprehensive, systematic, and complete plan and method as soon as possible to prevent cholera from attacking.

We recognize how cholera harms human beings, and we know how to defend ourselves. The lessons of past deaths are today's ability to defend ourselves. Let's not let cholera become a shameful and terrible epidemic in our country.

### Why Do We Get a Fever?

— Ji Ting

If a feverish patient is discovered in a home, whether adult or child, the harmonious atmosphere immediately turns to gloom and depression. Fever is a common symptom of many diseases. Therefore, fever is both commonplace and important. Why do we get a fever? To understand this, we must first understand the normal state of the body.

The body's heat is generated by various metabolic processes. Excess heat is dissipated through the evaporation and conduction of the skin and lungs, maintaining the balance of body temperature. Muscle movement can generate a lot of heat, but the dilation of skin blood vessels, the excretion of sweat, and accelerated breathing all dissipate heat, reducing body heat. If body temperature tends to drop, or the climate is cold, skin blood vessels constrict and sweat production decreases, storing heat within the body to maintain a normal temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), but it varies slightly with time and location. For example, the temperature in the anus is one degree higher than in the mouth, and the temperature in the evening is higher than in the morning, due to work and rest.

The brain has a center dedicated to body temperature, which keeps the body temperature normal. If the body temperature center is stimulated, the body temperature will change. Animal experiments have shown that when the body temperature center (striatum or hypothalamus) is punctured with a needle, the body temperature immediately increases, resulting in fever. So, under normal circumstances, body temperature is very well regulated.

Fever is a complex phenomenon in the body. Not only does the regulatory function of the skin change, but digestion, respiration, and blood circulation are also affected. Before a fever, the blood vessels of the skin constrict, blood flow decreases, and heat dissipation is reduced, naturally increasing body temperature. Therefore, one often feels cold due to the constriction of skin blood vessels before a fever. Fever is a good sign, in other words, fever is beneficial to the body. Fever is a physiological defense mechanism of the body. The body, like an administrative organization, discovers that an enemy—a germ—has invaded. The ruling center immediately issues an order to capture and destroy it, attacking with all its might to eliminate the enemy. We know that blood contains many defensive substances. Besides some that are invisible, there are many cells with phagocytic action. If germs are discovered, they all pool their strength, fighting bravely until the germs are eliminated. During a fever, blood circulation increases, enhancing the power of transporting troops, making phagocytic cells more active, which can accelerate the elimination of germs. At the same time, some germs can grow at normal body temperature but cannot survive in high-temperature environments. The antibodies produced during a high fever are also more abundant than at normal temperature. Therefore, fever invisibly increases the body's resistance to germs, like increasing the military force for defense and security.

In hot and dry environments, many people who drink too little water cannot dissipate heat. Or, in hot and humid climates, where body heat cannot evaporate, body temperature can increase, causing a fever. This is called "heatstroke," which mostly occurs in the summer. This is caused by the body's temperature regulation mechanism being hindered. If heatstroke lasts too long or the fever is too high, it can be life-threatening.

Many diseases can be diagnosed by observing the process of a fever. For example, malaria, with few exceptions, is known to start with cold, then heat, then sweating. This can help diagnose the disease by its fever pattern. Similarly, typhoid fever, pneumonia, and relapsing fever can all help doctors diagnose the illness by their fever patterns.

To know if someone has a fever, or the degree of the fever, the only way is to measure it with a thermometer. A thermometer is a necessary item in the home. Having a thermometer can save a lot of wasted money and anxiety, and reduce unnecessary worries. Housewives should also have some basic knowledge of fever to prevent adverse consequences and improve family health and happiness.

### Medical View of Fresh Milk

— Shou Wu Peiqing

Milk is a liquid food, a collection of nutrients. It is fully equipped with fat, protein, carbonized hydrogen, mineral salts, moisture, and vitamins. From infancy to old age, it is suitable for all seasons. Some use it to replace meals for their entire lives. Some use it temporarily to fill their stomachs when sick in bed. And many infants hold it as their lifeline. Its nutritional importance need not be repeated. As we move into the height of summer, when the weather is hot, drinking fresh milk naturally has its values to be aware of.

(1) The Quality of Fresh Milk: Fresh milk with pure and excellent quality is the best choice, the so-called Grade A milk. Grade B milk is inferior in composition. Milk with the TT mark indicates that the cow has been tested with Tuberculin and proven free of tuberculosis. Milk delivered early should be drunk in the morning. Milk delivered in the afternoon should be delivered in the afternoon, so that the freshness is not reduced and the quality is not damaged.

(2) Preservation of Fresh Milk: Preserving fresh milk is quite difficult in summer. Fresh milk straight from the farm, cannot be preserved permanently without changing its quality. If there is air-conditioning equipment (electric refrigerator, cold storage, etc.), preservation is convenient. Milk delivered in the morning, except for drinking, the remaining milk can be sterilized by boiling. After sterilization, let the pot cool and put it in the refrigerator for afternoon use. It is not advisable to store it for more than a day and night. Unsterilized milk should not be refrigerated, otherwise it will easily spoil.

(3) Bacteria Contained in Fresh Milk: Fresh milk contains many microorganisms. The first milk squeezed out contains even more bacteria, which gradually decreases later. In addition, dust flying in the air, filth from the cowshed, unhygienic fingers of the milker, and unsterilized utensils contribute to the abundance of bacteria, which goes without saying. In foreign countries, formal licensed dairy farms produce milk that, before sterilization, must not exceed 10,000 bacteria per 1 c.c. Milk of lower quality contains about 50,000 bacteria per 1 c.c.

(4) The Response of Fresh Milk to Heat: When fresh milk is heated to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, a thin milk skin forms on the surface. This is because a portion of the casein is broken down, floats to the surface, and dries. At the bottom, there is a thick sediment that sticks to the sides, formed by the melting of calcium salts. If boiled for a long time, the pot emits a unique and fragrant milk odor, caused by the decomposition of sulfur compounds in milk protein. At the same time, it turns a caramelized color, and some of the milk fat floats to the top, resulting in a poorer taste and reduced nutritional value.

(5) Methods of Sterilizing Fresh Milk: Fresh milk must be re-sterilized before drinking. Milk from the farm, even if it has been sterilized by the Pasteurization method, is not always reliable. This is because the time between bottling and delivery to the consumer's home is always several hours, and the delivery en route is subject to bumps, dust, wind, rain, and snow, which inevitably cause contamination. It is difficult to drink with peace of mind without re-sterilization. According to the Pasteur method, milk is heated to 145 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 minutes and then rapidly cooled. Its advantage is that the composition of the milk does not change, vitamin loss is minimal, and the milk is sterilized. All countries in the world adopt it, but it is difficult to implement without trained personnel. Within the home, the boiling method is more convenient. Pour the milk into a pot, heat it briefly, and when it boils, remove the lid to prevent it from overflowing. Take it out after about two minutes and drink it slightly cooled. A double-boiler method of heating milk is the safest and most convenient. However, it takes too long, which is its only drawback. Raw milk that has not been sterilized is particularly dangerous and should never be drunk.

(6) What Diseases Can Fresh Milk Transmit? Fresh milk has a high potential for transmitting diseases, with tuberculosis being the most frightening. Next are scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, dysentery, and cholera. Then there are foot-and-mouth disease and anthrax. Transmission can also be caused by unclean water. Diarrhea in children during the summer is often caused by poor milk. Therefore, health authorities in large cities strictly manage it to avoid the spread of disease.

(7) The Effect of Fresh Milk on Medicines: Fresh milk has a direct relationship with medicines, so patients who drink milk and take medicine should have a timed schedule. Medicines containing mercury, silver, or iodine, when taken with milk, can reduce the efficacy of the medicine. Taking them with various phage solutions can also reduce their effectiveness. Therefore, in cases of acute drug poisoning, doctors administer large amounts of fresh milk to neutralize the toxicity of corrosive drugs and lubricate the gastric and intestinal mucosa. As for taking alkaline medicines such as limewater and baking soda, they prevent the coagulation of milk, keeping it in a fluid state in the stomach. Acidic medicines, such as acetic acid, lactic acid, and dilute hydrochloric acid, cause fresh milk to coagulate rapidly into hard lumps that are difficult to digest. The stomach naturally secretes acid, so milk coagulates into lumps in the stomach. Fortunately, enzymes help the milk lumps gradually digest. The vomiting of milk lumps by infants is clear evidence of undigested, acid-coagulated milk.

Conclusion: Fresh milk is a nutritious mixture. Its effect is indeed better than dry milk powder and concentrated canned milk. In industrial chemistry, it is used as a natural raw material for manufacturing rayon, synthetic rubber, and artificial glass. In military chemistry, it is used as a raw material for manufacturing certain explosives. From a medical point of view, fresh milk has even wider uses. Because it is a liquid food, it is convenient to use. Whether for the sick or the healthy, for nourishment or leisure, it is universally applicable. It is also the only supplement to make up for the shortcomings of medicines.

On the other hand, fresh milk, because it contains rich fats and proteins, is also unsuitable for certain diseases, which may not be widely known. Here are some examples to clarify:

(1) Newborn infants, when breast milk is insufficient, and fresh milk is used as a substitute, after a considerable period, the infants become thin and have weakened resistance, lacking natural immunity, and are prone to diseases.

(2) Older infants, when breast milk is insufficient, using it for mixed feeding can easily cause indigestion, resulting in facial eczema (commonly known as milk rash) or other skin diseases.

(3) Acute nephritis, skin edema, reduce the input of protein to allow the urine to be excreted smoothly.

(4) Typhoid and paratyphoid fever, during the period of high fever, often have abdominal distension. To reduce the production of gas, avoid drinking milk.

(5) Dysentery and enteritis, frequent bowel movements, mixed with blood spots on the membrane, in order to reduce the breeding of bacteria, milk is also not suitable.

(6) Children with chronic indigestion, abdominal distension, rumbling sounds, to reduce the bloating of the intestines, fresh milk is also not suitable.

(7) Obese patients, weighing more than two hundred pounds, to avoid excessive diet and the absorption of large amounts of fat, fresh milk is also not suitable.

(8) Gout patients, uric acid excretion is not smooth, pain is abnormal, avoid drinking milk, in order to promote the discharge of uric acid.

(9) Patients with special neurological diseases and those with nervous hypersensitivity should avoid drinking it to avoid the peculiar smell of milk.

(10) Asthma patients, avoid drinking milk, sometimes to avoid the onset of paroxysmal asthma.

(11) During the convulsive period of pertussis children, drinking milk can easily cause the entire contents to be vomited, so semi-solid food is more suitable.

(12) Jaundice patients, bile duct blockage, should reduce the intake of milk, to avoid stimulating the secretion of bile.

(13) In the early stages of acute appendicitis, before surgery, the intake of milk should be completely stopped, in order to reduce the peristalsis of the intestinal tract.

(14) On the morning of administering general anesthesia, milk should be stopped, to avoid suffocation of the trachea when vomiting occurs during anesthesia.

These are just a few examples. But each disease has its stages, each doctor has their own opinions, not to mention nationality, region, old customs, personal habits, and personal quirks, which are all different. Some may also consider them not absolutely relevant, but my medical viewpoint should not be considered excessive criticism. I ask the readers, is it so?

(2) Murder and Jailbreak

Wang Yao-hua asks: The security section chief of our township office, Mr. A, was sentenced to life imprisonment in the past for intentional homicide. Later, he escaped from prison when the Japanese invaders captured the county seat and is now at large, running rampant in the countryside. Please advise: If Mr. A's sentence has not expired, should he be returned to prison to continue serving his sentence? Also, does a life-term prisoner still have civil rights? A detailed answer is desired.

[Lawyer Zhu Ya-kui Answers] If he escapes from prison before his sentence has expired, he should still be returned to prison to continue serving his sentence. Also, the period of deprivation of civil rights should depend on the court's judgment. However, those sentenced to life imprisonment should be declared deprived of civil rights for life.

### Seeking Girl Zhang Xiaomin

Continued by Mr. Zhang, who is poor, sick, unemployed, and has a family of four, making it difficult to survive. Last July, his wife led her second daughter (named Zhang Xiaomin, six years old, with a Wujiang accent) to Shanghai to make a living, intending to work as a domestic helper. However, she could not find a place to settle with the girl, so she sent her to a certain charitable children's organization, but forgot its name and location. It is reported that the organization did not agree to take her in at the time. Fortunately, a certain staff member saw that the child was clever and her mother's situation was truly pitiful, so they adopted her. A year has passed before Mr. Zhang learned of this. He has come to Shanghai several times to search for her but has not found her. He is so heartbroken over his daughter that he has developed a nervous disorder. The separation of flesh and blood is extremely tragic! We are now seeking her on his behalf. It is hoped that the person who adopted the girl will notify this newspaper immediately so that Zhang Xiaomin can be reunited with her parents and her father can be rescued from his predicament. This would be a great good deed.

Spring and Autumn

### The Warbling Bird

— Xie Zi

We have moved to our current address for several years. In this alley, there is another family that moved here with us. This family is just like what Wordsworth said in a poem: "We are seven in number," father, mother, two sons, and three daughters. But before long, the eldest son and his father died one after another, and the seven became five. Now it has become four, because the middle daughter has married.

Except for this married daughter, the others are all just over four feet tall. But they have one appealing thing, that is, their home is filled with music all day long. When we first came, we heard the second daughter singing and practicing her voice. Her voice was very loud, and she was not afraid of people watching, listening, or laughing. She not only sang but also used musical instruments to accompany her. At first, it was a harmonium, and later it became a piano. The piano was borrowed from her lover, but she couldn't play it, she simply couldn't distinguish between the musical notes. Fortunately, she sang very well, with the style of a certain soprano. And she deliberately learned from her, becoming more and more like her. We thought she was probably a music teacher in a small school. But how could she be a teacher with that piano of hers? Among the three daughters, the eldest did not like to sing, and the youngest followed her second sister's example. Sometimes the second son would also hum along, but his voice was a bit unbearable. But his sisters did not object to his singing, and sometimes they would sing with him. It was truly a happy musical family.

But slowly, the second daughter's interest turned elsewhere. She began to fall in love. She saved her singing time to write love letters or talk to her lover. So the only one who continued to play and sing in this family was the youngest daughter. She was more persistent in singing than her sister. She not only sang for fun but also treated it as a serious matter. She not only wanted to learn from a certain soprano but also from many other singers. Unfortunately, her family was not very well off. Her older brother and sister were working outside, and she had to help her mother with household chores. But she never relaxed in her remaining time and devoted it all to singing. Although she was still young, her singing was inevitably childish, but she was fat and her voice was exceptionally round. Besides, she had another advantage, that is, she became more and more beautiful day by day. Of course, this beauty was only a childish beauty, but her future was by no means bleak, so she was very happy in her heart. Every day, after doing her duties with a happy heart, she began to play and sing. Sometimes, when she was tired of singing, she would go outside to plant flowers and prune the flower garden. But before long, she would suddenly remember something important, run into the room, and pick up her songbook. So the chaotic piano sounds and her clear singing would start again.

Year after year, her singing improved a lot, but her sister's singing became a thing of the past. Before long, her sister got married. After she got married, she took the piano with her, so the youngest daughter had to use clappers instead of the piano. Sometimes she would go to her sister's house. The purpose of her visit was not to see her sister, but to see the piano. She was now seventeen or eighteen years old, and she looked fresh, lively, and in the eyes of most people, she was invariably praised for her beauty. There was only one drawback, that is, she could not be as outstanding as her second sister and grow taller. Her height was probably less than four feet, and she was at the age of development, so she could not wear high heels, she could only grow horizontally, so she became fatter day by day. Fortunately, what most people paid attention to was often just a face. As long as the face was beautiful, they would not be too demanding of other things. So, whether in the eyes of others or in her own eyes, she belonged to the category of beauties.

Perhaps it was this self-awareness of beauty that created a new situation for her. She can sing at home, why can't she sing outside? Those who are not as good-looking as her and sing worse than her still want to be singers, why can't she be one? In fact, she had long had this ambition in private. She had been painstakingly learning to sing for years, all for this. Now that the time was ripe, why didn't she start immediately? No, she has already started. Every day, she wears beautiful clothes, dresses up glamorously, and goes to engage in her new career. She goes out very late and comes back even later. Her family has gained a new batch of acquaintances, all of whom are fancy girls.

But she doesn't go out during the day. She still stays at home to sing during the day. And because she now has a slightly better income, she bought a radio. So, as long as she is at home, not a minute or a second goes by without popular songs being broadcast. When one station's program is over, she switches to another station. Sometimes she sings along with it, and the singing becomes even louder. Now the weather is getting sultry, and no one can avoid turning on the fan, so songs like "You're Obsessed," "Is It True or False," and "I Want You" are everywhere. If there is someone who is in the dancing business, they can't help but dance in their pockets.

One day, I was reading the newspaper and unintentionally saw an advertisement for a coffee shop, which read, "Special Guest Performance by Miss Gu Jing." I knew that Gu Si was not her, because I had seen Gu Jia. But I couldn't help but think in my heart, if I gave her the name Gu Jia, how appropriate it would be! "A Warbling Bird from the Valley" is a perfect portrayal of her!

### The Names of Grasses, Trees, Birds, and Beasts

— Zhu Wen

Wang Yun wrote in a poem: "Frost covers the creeping fig on the locust tree, wind startles the grass guarding the door." It is said that Changshan has a herb called "Hundred Spirits Grass." If placed under the door, when something harmful passes by, the grass will scold it, hence the name. "Creeping fig on the locust tree" is mentioned in the Erya, its leaves curling up during the day. Gu Yaofan wrote in a poem: "Startling the talking myna bird, monkeys cry along with the 'indeed' bird." Yuan Weizhi wrote in a poem: "'Indeed' bird's skin is better than silk, myna bird's tongue is like a human's." "Myna bird" resembles the starling, entirely black, with yellow fleshy crests behind the eyes, yellow feet, and a red beak, capable of imitating human speech. "Indeed bird," according to Tianzhong Ji, resembles a macaque and calls out its own name. Lu Guimeng wrote in a poem: "Resting often in the shade of the 'crow uncle', often seeing the 'mouse aunt's' heart when picking." "'Crow uncle'" is a kind of bird, also known as "slap cheek," or "mountain call." "'Mouse aunt'" is another name for the peony, mentioned in the herbal classics. Nowadays, those who casually recognize the names of plants, birds, and beasts may not be able to explain these.

### Cuckoo

— Ren Weiyin

The cuckoo is cruel,

It is the ornament of twilight.

But fair God, the cuckoo is innocent!

Because without it, this sorrow still exists.

The mountains and forests are dense and desolate, the fiery red of the pomegranate flowers has faded, this is the time when the cuckoo cries blood, as the poet says; this is the sorrow filtered out by the web of life. I do not know what this little black-feathered creature thinks of the universe, but I am infected by this desolate chill, this bottomless melancholy.

I have always been afraid of the word "homecoming," homecoming is the end of everything; including the beautiful desolation of a wanderer at dusk in the cold. I love the character of the Gypsies, I love that musical people, when the cooking fire is lit in the wilderness, when the door of tomorrow has not yet opened, isn't the mystery of the future the most touching? Cuckoo! Tonight, in my sleepless hearing, I hear your call again, are you sighing for tomorrow, or are you longing for the past, when the ancient warriors under the yellow sand are all sleeping soundly, can you not help but indulge in unrestrained reveries towards the vast sky, do you love the spirit of Emperor Wang (Note 1), or do you still miss the ancient beauties and lands?

Ah, cuckoo! Only the wise have sorrow and indignation, only those who die for love have eternal sleep, perhaps you understand the taste of retiring after success, but you are willing to throw yourself into the torrent, transforming into wide-spreading wings soaring through the world (Note 2), but life is just a cup of bitter wine, you can only drink it once, and after this drink, will it bring your complaints morning and evening? No, cuckoo, I know that this complaint is the end of the season, a sign of people's distress, but it is the beginning of everything for you.

Tonight, I wander alone under the silent eaves, your cries come from further and further away. At this moment, there is not a single ray of light in the long sky, the white radiance of the stars and moon are all flickering outside the thick dark clouds; I cannot shorten the distant distance of space, lift your skin to the sky; however, the stars and moon shining in the sky seem to be bright in my heart. Although the darkness is all around me, the dense rows of mountains and forests are already containing the night dew rising.

Where is the edge of the desolate wilderness? Where does the writing of dusty history begin? Where are the famous officials, beauties? Where are the giants, sons, famous kings, and famous generals? Cuckoo! Underneath is piled up the stale continuation of history, in that stale wax, there are bones and white bones; skulls and white bones forever have your sigh, a cup of bitter wine can only be drunk once, and after this drink, what can be done to redeem you?

Ah! The source of the overflowing water, the highest peak of the mountain, whether it is high in the sky or deep in the sea, is turning in a circle. The Creator did not ignite the fire deep in the earth, expelling the severe cold in the sky; but through ancient times to uninhabited centuries, icebergs have frozen the fierce water, and the fierce fire has also scorched the ocean. Not a single poet, not a single hero has ever thought of this. Cuckoo! Do you feel that human beings are too small? Therefore, I understand your complaints, your powerful sigh;

But this sigh is just un-notated music, like a laborer's dream, waking up leaving only vague impressions. I don't know how much difference there is between talent and foolishness, the distance of this question, then destined your weaving fate. You are a poet of grief, you sing of the old age of the season, you ignite feelings for the insignificant human beings.

In the night of Bashan, the thick and fragrant flowers have already dissipated. The always hungry green velvet is now silent in the middle of the night; what does the poet of destiny want to do? From across the window sill comes your lonely lament.

Note 1: "Huayang Guozhi": Shu chancellor Kaiming admired the beauty of Emperor Du Yu's empress, and even assassinated Emperor Wang to seize his queen. Emperor Wang's resentment did not dissipate, and he entered Qingcheng Mountain and transformed into a strange bird, which is Du Juan, also known as Du Yu. Li Yishan's line "Emperor Wang's spring heart entrusted to Du Juan" refers to this.

Note 2: Li Bing controlled the waters, dredged the Minjiang and Tuojiang rivers, and completed the water conservancy of Sichuan Province. As soon as the work was completed, Li Bing threw himself into the water and transformed into a cuckoo. See "Qingcheng Mountain Records," and also the Sichuan people's legend that Lady Huarui transformed into a cuckoo.

### Small Gathering Listening to Cicadas

— Lao Kai

Cicada

The cicada represents the coming of bright summer, shedding its ancient yellowish-brown shell, and is such a powerful symbol of health!

It squats on high green branches, overlooking the bustling world, looking askance at everything. In order not to sink and float with the world, it would rather feed on the wind and dew, living a simple life.

At dawn, when the morning breeze and the waning moon remain, it is the first to awaken. When dusk quietly falls from the peaks, it leisurely sings its song.

Its song is so noisy that those who compete for fame and profit cannot help but feel disturbed and agitated when they hear it.

However, this noble hermit always opens his stubborn eyes, and does not easily stop his singing because of other people's disgust.

It sings, even when the sun is shining white in the scorching noon, it does not feel the threat of heat or a trace of weariness.

Bad children walk towards it with bamboo poles. "Born of dust, die of dust." is its ready-made eulogy.

Shooting Star

On summer nights, one can often see shooting stars passing through my window, passing through the plains of Guanghan.

Shooting stars are like sparks of hope that flash and disappear; they are also like the lengthened tear lines of a passionate girl in longing.

When I was a child, I often wanted to get some explanation from it, but I couldn't. I once thought of it as a flying firefly with a tail.

I love it for finally having a moment of brilliance in the deathly dark night; finally burning the flame of life.

Summer Clouds

Clouds are beautiful, and summer clouds are especially beautiful.

Some say: Clouds are illusions woven from color; clouds are rich poems.

Stretching outside my window: there is a high and strange sky, and there are all kinds of floating clouds, these clouds are sometimes peach-colored, gray-colored, and sometimes milky white, lead-colored. Its traces are also quite difficult to grasp: here, it sometimes hangs upside down at the edge of the forest, like a wine flag, sometimes lying horizontally on the mountainside, like a huge white python; sometimes it wanders in the azure sea of the sky, making people think of ancient, clear sails.

In vulgar busyness, or in lonely leisure, taking the time to look at the clouds, perhaps it is not entirely meaningless, right?

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 348

— Ye Jingfeng

The oracle is a very auspicious one, a series of killings. It only advocates sweeping away demons, not revenge. Because of the guidance of this oracle, Dingyuan also returned to his original advocacy; instead of seeking private revenge, it is better to keep a useful body to avenge the country. He felt that although the old Taoist had limited knowledge, he was a sincere person, so he planned with the old Taoist on how to kill the demons. The old Taoist originally advised Dingyuan to "disguise himself as a Taoist priest, which can prevent the demons from suspecting him," but unfortunately, Dingyuan did not have long hair and could not pretend to be a Taoist priest; he simply shaved his head and became a temporary Buddhist disciple. The old Taoist said, "Very good, Buddhism and Taoism are one family. In the past, the Three Purities often visited Tathagata Buddha, and the Bodhisattvas Cundi, Amitabha, and Guanyin all came from Taoism..." Before Dingyuan left, the old Taoist returned the pistol he had found on Dingyuan, and promised to burn incense for him every day, asking the Three Purities and the Demon-Subduing Erlang God to silently bless him and sweep away the demons.

Dingyuan's disguise was very much to the liking of the Japanese devils. After several contacts, the Japanese army actually invited Dingyuan to chant scriptures for the Japanese soldiers who died in battle, because their "military monks" had not accompanied the army on this expedition. The Japanese secret service also gradually contacted Dingyuan, using him to inquire about some trivial news...

"This is my little experience," Dingyuan told me; "It's going quite well... I'm very good at fabricating intelligence, but I'm just suffering from the fact that I can't transmit the devils' movements to our own army... I have also tried my best to act within the range restricted by the devils..."

"It wasn't until the night before yesterday that I suddenly learned that the Japanese secret agents had captured several 'anti-Japanese elements' here in Changping, that I decided to get involved with them. They told me to pay attention to other comrades active outside, there are dozens of them in total, especially to pay attention to their leader, a big girl in her twenties, who might pass through Changping..."

"That night, I accidentally ran into Miss Ji Yaoqun, who was dressed as a man. Originally, I didn't recognize her, but she saw through my disguise and called out my name in one breath..." As soon as I heard that Yaoqun was really here, I interrupted Dingyuan and asked him if he could bring Yaoqun here, or if we could go find her.

"Not today," Dingyuan sighed, "If it could be done, Captain Sun (〇4) would have invited Miss Ji over just now..."

"What do you mean?" I heard Dingyuan sigh and was afraid that Yaoqun had also been captured by the Japanese secret agents.

"Don't worry," Dingyuan rushed to reassure me: "It's just that she's too brave: she went to Zhiyi Bridge last night..."

"What for?" I couldn't help but exclaim with concern.

"To arrange an action, probably related to the several comrades who were arrested here, to rescue them from danger."

"Why go to Zhiyi Bridge?... Where is this bridge?" I seemed to have lost my mind, pressing Dingyuan to ask.

"Zhiyi Bridge is seven or eight li south of here, not far from Xiyan Town in Shahe County, it is the headquarters of the Japanese secret service..."

"Why would she run to the demon's den alone?" I asked myself; and asked the other question? "Is she alone, or does she have helpers -- that troublemaker from Yihu City?..."

"I'm not too clear about that," Dingyuan seemed to be recalling something. ... Sighing, as if

I am delighted to hear that the municipal government has formally convened various parties to discuss the issue of rents in this city, because this concerns the livelihood of all people in Shanghai, we cannot help but hope that the municipal government can use a "quick knife to cut through the mess" this time, and completely solve the case that has been unresolved since the victory.

Shanghai has a dense population, much higher than before the war, that is a fact; government agencies are concentrated in the downtown area, and office workers have to live in the city center, that is also a fact; the number of military units in the suburbs of Shanghai has increased, and they demand housing, that is also a fact; the number of military vehicles in Shanghai has increased sharply, with the total number of various military vehicles reaching 210,000, causing civilian housing to also reach saturation, this is also a fact; due to these factors (plus price fluctuations, and the soaring black market prices of gold and US dollars), they can all create the abnormal state of rents in Shanghai.

There are many empty rooms in Shanghai, and skyscrapers are everywhere, what they want are gold bars, US dollars, and legal tender, some people calculate interest rates, and are not willing to let the house; people without gold bars and US dollars have no way to rent a house. This causes; there are houses without people living in them, and people without houses do not know where to squeeze in?

We ask the municipal government to open up these empty high-rise buildings, open up those empty rooms closed off with gold bars and US dollars! Establish fair and impartial leasing regulations, so that Shanghai can return to the pre-war rental state!

Just like the municipal government's several battles with the black market for gold and US dollars, the rent issue will also require sending out a large number of inspectors, using lightning-fast tactics, and forcing those empty houses to open up, if necessary, encouraging citizens to report in secret, conducting a comprehensive investigation of all the surplus houses in Shanghai, so that they can be legally rented out.

### Returning from Iron Anchors: Remembering the Sino-Japanese Naval War of 1894

— Bao Qing

Following the anchor chains and shells brought back to the motherland by the Flying Star Wheel, two iron anchors also returned with the Long Shun Wheel. When we saw the foot-long iron anchors, we could still imagine the heroic posture of the Zhenyuan battleship, the mother body of the anchor. For fifty years, the anchors and shells were displayed as trophies in Hibiya Park in Japan. After several negotiations after the victory, they finally returned to the motherland. How can we not be filled with emotion when we see this?

Recalling before 1894, the total tonnage of the national navy reached as much as 145,900 tons. If inland river vessels are removed, there are still 85,000 tons, which is more than four-tenths greater than Japan's total of 59,000 tons. In the 17th year of the Guangxu reign, Ding Ruchang once led six battleships and cruisers on an eastward tour of Japan. Two years later, Li Hongzhang held a grand naval review in the Xianhaiwei, and the strength of the fleet shocked and frightened Japan, causing them to prepare for war. However, not long after, in the war of 1894, China was defeated, its weaknesses were fully exposed, and the navy was completely annihilated. What was the reason for this?

People in the past have lamented the uselessness of our navy, but in reality, they have not thoroughly understood the environment, situation, and combat process at that time. The Sino-Japanese War of 1894 had the main battle of the Yellow Sea and two defense battles in Lushun and Weihaiwei. Soviet historians once commented on the Weihaiwei military battle: "The Chinese army showed indeed heroism." After the Battle of Fengdao, the sea power of the Korean Peninsula was lost. The Battle of the Yellow Sea was comparable to the Battle of Jutland between Britain and Germany during the European War. Later, in the Lushun and Weihaiwei defense battles, the army abandoned the fortress, which forced the tragic fate of the fleet. In terms of the Battle of the Yellow Sea, the enemy had 12 ships totaling 39,487 tons. Our Admiral Ding commanded the Beiyang Fleet with nine battleships and one Guangjia ship, totaling 31,345 tons, so the strength was already inferior. The Zhenyuan ship was protecting Ding Ruchang's flagship, the Dingyuan ship. The 12-inch shells were exhausted, the deck was severely damaged, the third officer died, and the first officer commanded the battle with his whole body covered in blood. The officers and soldiers suffered many casualties. The ship fought bravely in the Weihaiwei battle and was captured, but the new captain Yang Yonglin committed suicide with a pistol in his mouth, and his death was particularly tragic. Therefore, the return of the iron anchors is due to the war history of the past, and it is not ashamed of the motherland. Because our warships had low speed, the cannons were old and few, and the armor was weak, the comparison in quality was large, but they were still able to fight and resist the enemy. However, the cause of the defeat was not only this.

We examine the history of the Sino-Japanese Naval War and gain a few lessons: First, the government was corrupt, arrogant, and did not pay attention to naval preparations. For example, Li Hongzhang strongly requested the court to purchase warships and rapid-firing guns, but he was blocked by his political enemies and those who opposed war, such as Weng Tonghe, who said, "How can Japan dare to offend our superior country? The preparations made by the Beiyang Fleet are enough to break Japan's courage, and it is expected that they will not cross the sea and come from afar." The officials in the court were contemptuous of the enemy and arrogant, did not understand the situation, and neglected naval defense, especially since the 20 million taels of silver used for military ships were moved to repair the Summer Palace, and there was no hope of adding ships and purchasing cannons. How could one speak of fighting with a majority of simple ships against the newly built Japanese ships that were unanimously built by the court and the public? Second, military discipline was lax. At that time, the generals ate dirty things and embezzled military pay. Some of the cannons were unbearable to fire. The people who purchased the cannons only sought to reduce the price by 30% to 20%, without asking if they were usable. The Weihaiwei fort's garrison commander suppressed the pay for three months, and moved them to his home during the war. The supplies that should have been issued to the various ships were also contracted and embezzled; and the staff of the armory actually acted as spies, selling the list of Chinese naval heavy artillery and the number of soldiers and information on troop transports. Third, military administration and military orders were not unified, and the army and navy did not coordinate in combat. Li Hongzhang commanded the Beiyang Navy, Zeng Guoquan commanded the Nanyang Navy, and the Minyue Navy and others also managed themselves, and did not interfere with each other. The Naval Yamen had no power to command, and Admiral Ding Ruchang could not command the national fleet (he himself was a land general). Without a commander, how could one not be defeated? And the army and navy also had no coordinated plans for overall combat. Fighting without an overall strategy and unified command, the signs of defeat were already obvious. For example, the cannons were actually under the control of the army, the forts were neglected, the port defenses were empty, and the navy's liaison was ineffective, and they were forced into an inferior position everywhere. Although Li Hongzhang was a sincere person, he was unable to plan effectively overall before and during the war. Without repairing military equipment and unifying military orders, it is difficult to control the chances of victory.

Looking back on the lessons of the past, at this time of building the army, it is precisely the time to focus on reforms. But our coastal defense , coastal defense is still not firmly established by words, we must work hard. What's more, Japan is now attempting to make a comeback. Recently, the general allowed the Japanese to establish a whaling fleet and go to the Antarctic to hunt whales and fish in the central sea, which is a premonition of the Japanese future conspiracy to establish a medical team, and should be guarded against. Our country should take the same position as Australia and resolutely oppose it.

### One of Germany's Mistakes

— Gu Bin

The British scientists, in assisting their navy to gain an advantage in the war against German submarines, certainly played an important role and constantly forced the enemy to frequently change its tactics.

According to relevant sources, in the early spring of 1944, German Admiral Doenitz once gave a speech containing "pep talks" to German naval officers in Weimar, in which he made an interesting comment on British science, especially mentioning "Radiolocation." He said: "At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, one development on the enemy's side (referring to the British side) has obviously made us feel worried, and will always make us feel worried, that is, the enemy's use of radiolocation to deprive our submarines of a very important characteristic - its element of surprise. Now they have used this principle to gradually overcome the threat given to them by our submarines."

Doenitz went on to say that the scientists who invented radiolocation had been revered as saviors of their country. It can be seen that what led to success in submarines was not any superior strategy or tactics, but really due to the superiority of scientific research.

"Germany withdrew her very valuable scientists, ordered them to serve in the armed forces, and did not allow them to continue to engage in scientific research, until after a long period of eight months, the highest authorities finally ordered them to be exempted from service and ordered them to return to the laboratory to work again. We should admit that we have made a big mistake."

However, the British authorities did not make such a major mistake. On the contrary, since the outbreak of the war, they immediately directed their scientists, both inside and outside the armed forces, to quickly engage in scientific research. Specifically, the Admiralty hired more than 3,000 scientists, buried in their various laboratories and offices, so they were slightly better than the scientists in any other country. And they were also recruited into the newly formed "British Royal Naval Scientific Research Institute," and given very generous monthly salaries.

From this point, we can know that the British Navy was the first in the world to recognize the importance of maintaining scientific research work, regardless of wartime or peacetime, so it first established such a special research institute that recruited various talents, such as those familiar with magnetic mines and invented hymophones.

A Small Lamb Can Be Made Large

Weilu Suoji contains a story about "A Sheep Coming Out of a Sleeve":

"In Zhili Province, whenever it is time to sacrifice to the sages on the Shangding day, the butcher prepares sheep and pigs, but the school official will repeatedly criticize them for being thin and scrawny. Even after ten exchanges, none are suitable for use. Only when the butcher bribes the Guangwen can he agree. There was a fortunate butcher who, on the eve of the provincial sacrifice, the sheep still did not arrive. The officers urgently pressed him, and the butcher slowly entered, wearing wide clothes and sleeves, with something heavy in his sleeves. The officer said: You supply the sheep several times, has the sheep arrived? It's late. The butcher took out a small lamb from his sleeve. The officer said: A lamb is not enough for the sacrifice. The butcher said: There is something else, and then took out more than ten thousand banknotes, and said: The lamb is small and thin, this is to help the lamb get fat and make it large. The officer laughed. The butcher left with an arrogant look."

Here, the face of the school official is thoroughly sketched out. The officer's "laughter" and the butcher's "arrogance" are both wonderfully portrayed, worthy of a "Record of the Appearance of the Official Arena." "The yamen opens its eight characters, don't come in without money." With money, a small lamb can be turned into "large", decay can be turned into magic, and a bribe is more than just "can communicate with the gods."

American Secret Service Agents

Where there is government, there are secret agents. Secret agents are the ears and eyes of the government, the nerves of the government. The Qing Yongzheng Emperor had a very thorough secret service organization, but their scope of activity was limited to the palace, and they could not be fully utilized. The secret agents of Germany, Russia, and Japan are all famous in the world, but the quality of the Americans is the highest. Washington has a secret agent training school, which is the main camp for the United States to manufacture secret agents. The qualifications for admission must be graduation from a university with a degree in law, economics, or political science, having worked as a lawyer or accountant for three years, and must have a proper appearance, elegant demeanor, and be well-spoken, without any white-collar air. After being trained rigorously for several years after entering the school, they must be able to speak and write multiple foreign languages and be able to use all kinds of small weapons, such as various pistols, machine guns, and air guns, before being assigned work. These agents are mostly neatly dressed in suits and ties, carrying briefcases in one hand, or wearing gold-rimmed glasses, appearing like university professors, and no one suspects that they are secret agents. American secret agents often enter society with identities as lawyers or foreign businessmen, bankers, educators, military officers, business tycoons, and artists, and thus can infiltrate various industries without being suspected by outsiders. Their murder weapons are hidden very carefully, most of them hidden in their overcoats or raincoats. Their marksmanship is extremely precise, and they never hit vital points when capturing criminals alive. The head of the secret service, Hoover, is the nephew of former President Hoover, and he is indomitable. Whenever capturing major criminals, Hoover personally takes the lead. When he captured Public Enemy Number One, Capone, alive, he only led three armored vehicles, blocked the main road, and used loudspeakers to persuade him to surrender. Public Enemy Number One, seeing that there was no way to escape, surrendered. Hoover shook hands with him and rode in the same military vehicle. When President Roosevelt went to Africa to attend the Three Giants Summit, the American secret agents made arrangements in Cairo a month in advance. Heavy artillery was placed in any tall building. The Japanese secret agents detected that the Three Giants were meeting in Cairo, but in fact they were meeting in Tehran. This was an American secret agent trick. The British Ambassador to Jiang learned from South America that someone should secretly meet with President Roosevelt. The Jiang's secret service sent a group of troops directly from Cairo, disguised as sailors to Nanzhen, and the British sent an envoy to present Roosevelt with a list of German secret agents in the United States, and then they captured all the German spies. Hoover has now published a portion of these stories in books. (22)
