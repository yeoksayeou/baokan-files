The destroyed tracks have been repaired and traffic has resumed.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Thirtieth of This Month] A semi-official source stated that the outside world has overemphasized the issue of opening the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section.

### US Ammunition Depot in Xinhe Transferred to Nationalist Troops

Surplus Ammunition Like Scrap Metal

[United Press Dispatch from Tianjin, Thirtieth of This Month] U.S. Commander Howard announced today the transfer of the U.S. ammunition depot in Xinhe to the Nationalist troops, stating that after the depot was attacked by the communist forces on April 5th, most of the shells and other ammunition were loaded onto warships for self-use. The remaining small amount of ammunition was also transferred to the Chinese troops on April 21st. The depot was then handed over to Sun Suzong's troops for takeover. This matter was carried out on the orders of the U.S. Navy Department. After the communist attack, most of the stored ammunition was unusable and could not be moved. The exact amount of ammunition transferred to the Nationalist troops was not specified, only that it could mostly be used as scrap metal and was dangerous to move, at most only suitable for target practice. The Chinese authorities were also aware of this situation. There were also some Japanese tanks, which had been disarmed and could only be used as scrap metal. He also explained that the U.S. military was withdrawing completely (the U.S. troops in Tanggu will withdraw within the month), so transferring this ammunition to the Nationalist troops was for convenience. Destroying it on the spot would take at least two months. However, this action by the U.S. military does not set a precedent, and ammunition stored elsewhere does not need to be handled in this way, but should be regarded as belonging to the respective units. Tanks and other heavy weapons will be transferred with the troops to new defense areas in the Pacific, but none will be transferred to the Korean Peninsula.

### Wu Xianzi's Statement

[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] After arriving in Shanghai, Wu Xianzi, Vice Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, has been busy mediating internal party disputes. Yesterday, he issued the following statement: "I, Xianzi, saw reports in Hong Kong about internal disputes within the Democratic Socialist Party. At first, I did not believe them, but after learning that they were true, I was very surprised. I immediately sent a telegram to my party colleagues, asking them to calm down and seek a solution, and not to publish any more attacking remarks to the outside world, so as to increase the difficulties. After arriving in Shanghai on the 26th, I immediately visited various parties within the party and listened to their reports with a calm mind. I have never made any statements or comments to any party within the party. However, a certain newspaper reported yesterday that Xianzi "After meeting with Mr. Zhang Junmai, he reportedly told people that if it were 30 years ago in his youth, he would have slammed the table and shouted." Such records do not correspond to the facts. I sincerely hope that the press will not use speculative words to make inaccurate reports about the party's disputes, and I urge my party colleagues to think from a big picture perspective, calm their emotions, and not distort the facts or use them as propaganda to increase the difficulties of resolving the issue and confuse the public."

### Zhang Qun Talks About Current Important Matters; Says There is No Reason to Be Pessimistic About the Economic Future; Currency Reform is Only a Matter of Time

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Thirtieth of This Month] At a cocktail reception for the Beijing and Shanghai press on the afternoon of the 30th, President Zhang said: "There is no reason to be pessimistic about the economic future. If we can make good use of our country's resources and potential, it will not be difficult to be self-reliant. The press is paying too much attention to loans, as if it would be difficult to revive the country without loans. The actual situation is not like this. Economic problems should be solved from an economic perspective, and we should not rely solely on political forces. I will ensure that the short-term and long-term measures I have proposed in the policy guidelines can be realized. Governing is not about empty talk or playing tricks. If we can take both short-term and long-term measures into consideration and work hard, we can achieve results. Currency reform is only a matter of time, but we cannot act rashly until all preparations are completed. Balancing the budget will be the main work goal of the government in the future." When reporters asked him to explain in detail the "Executive Yuan Responsibility System" and the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, Zhang said: "The Executive Yuan is a whole, and should be fully responsible." As for the relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, the two institutions should maintain close contact. The Executive Yuan is the agency that implements the resolutions of the National Government Council, and the various laws and regulations drafted by the Executive Yuan must be completed through the legislative process by the Legislative Yuan. He believes that there will never be a situation of confrontation with the Legislative Yuan. Zhang attaches great importance to enhancing administrative efficiency, but said that increasing administrative efficiency cannot be achieved overnight. The problem of people, housing facilities, etc. are all related to it, and even the smallest details, such as a telephone, can affect administrative efficiency. He joked to reporters: "Please forgive me for not providing cigarettes and tea when you visit me in the future, because although this is a small detail, it is not very expensive, but it also affects administrative efficiency." Some Shanghai reporters hoped that Zhang could go to Shanghai for instructions. Zhang said: "I have been in the government for thirty years and come from the people, so I know the hardships of the people very well. In the future, I will do my best to relieve the suffering of the people. I have lived in Shanghai for two or thirty years, and I once served as the mayor of Shanghai, so I am very concerned about everything there. However, since the political capital is in Nanjing, there is no need for me to shuttle between Beijing and Shanghai. Even for the governor of the Central Bank, it is better to be stationed in the capital." Today's cocktail reception was the largest gathering of the press in the capital since the closing of the National Assembly. In addition to Zhang himself, government officials who attended included Gan Naiguang, Dong XianGuang, and Peng Xuepei. Over a hundred people from the press attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Zhao Junhao, Zhao Minheng, Xiao Tongzi, and Chen Bosheng. The reception began at 5:30 p.m. and ended happily at around 7:00 p.m.

Deputy Directors Zeng Xubai and Deng Youde were also present. Dong said first: "I welcome you today as the Director of the Information Office and extend my sincere respect. The establishment of the information agency by the Executive Yuan was only recently announced. Organizing this new agency, formulating work plans, and determining the scope of work for each department will not be completed overnight. However, I will do my best to quickly complete all preparations and promote our work officially as soon as possible. The establishment of an information agency under a multi-party government is still a new initiative and has a novel significance. I will find another opportunity in the future to explain the Information Office's work plan to you. The regular weekly press conference, which was very successful under the leadership of Minister Peng, will continue to be held in the future. The government's completion of preparations for constitutional government relies heavily on the contributions of the press. I hope that in the future, in addition to press conferences, there will be other ways to facilitate the work of the press."

Dong then answered the following questions raised by reporters:

Question: Please explain the situation of the attack on the Wuhu newspaper office. Has the government taken steps to prevent such incidents from happening again?

Mr. Shen further stated that China urgently wants to clear and dispose of the closed banks that engaged in the expansion of Japanese finance and economy in the occupied areas of China, and inquired with the banking experts of the Allied Headquarters attending the meeting about how to handle the assets of the Bank of Taiwan, the "Central Bank of Manchuria," the North China Development Company, the Central China Development Company, the South Manchuria Railway Company, the Taiwan Development Company, and the China Heavy Industries Development Company. However, the Headquarters banking experts stated that the handling of the above banks and companies is extremely complicated and that it would take several months to collect the materials. Mr. Shen informed the Council that the above institutions were related to Japan's financial and economic expansion in China, and that the Chinese government reserves the right to express its views on all liquidation matters through appropriate channels in the future.

### Executive Yuan Allocates 9.5 Billion Yuan to Handle Aftermath in Yellow River Flood Area; Temporary Executive Committee for Flood Area Affairs Established

[This City News] The Executive Yuan has recently established a Temporary Executive Committee for the Affairs of the Yellow River Flood Area in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The first meeting was held yesterday (the 30th). The responsibilities of the committee are to coordinate the temporary affairs of the flood area. The committee members include Xiang Jingyun, Zhu Bingnan, Xu Fuqi, Sun Dehe, Weng Wei, Shen Weining, Xu Yongshun, Chen Hongduo, Ma Baozhi, and Zhang Bingrui, totaling ten people.

The Executive Yuan has recently allocated 9.5 billion yuan, which will be distributed to the three sub-bureaus in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, to handle the emergency aftermath in the flood area of the three provinces.

According to Xiang Jingyun, chairman of the Temporary Executive Committee, the use of the allocated funds has been specifically designated, including: 2 billion yuan for relief expenses for returning refugees in the Henan flood area, 1 billion yuan for relief expenses for refugees in the Jiangsu flood area, 500 million yuan for relief expenses for refugees in the Anhui flood area, 1 billion yuan specifically for the purchase of seeds, and 500 million yuan for the purchase of agricultural tools, food, and business expenses. The Temporary Executive Committee decided yesterday to increase the number of plowing machines allocated to the Henan flood area to 400 to assist local returning farmers in cultivating the yellow mud silt. Henan currently has 113 plowing machines, and 119 more will soon be transported from Hankou to Henan, and 168 will be transported from Shanghai to Henan.

The returning refugees in the flood area are most in need of seeds, so the Executive Yuan prioritizes seeds for transportation to the flood area. Recently, 100 tons will be transported from Shanghai to Kaifeng, and more will continue to be transported in the future. Before the harvest from this year's cultivation in the flood area, farmers must rely on relief food. The Executive Yuan is increasing the transportation of food to the flood area. The first 10,000 tons of food are scheduled to arrive by May 15, and the second batch of 17,000 tons of food is scheduled to be transported by the end of May. The priority order for transporting materials to the flood area has been stipulated: seeds and food are transported first, followed by plowing machines, plows, and gasoline, then agricultural hand tools, and finally tools for agricultural tool manufacturing and blacksmithing.

### U.S. Congressman Judd Urges Loan to China

[United Press Washington 29th Dispatch] Congressman Judd issued a statement advocating that the Export-Import Bank should immediately lend 500 million U.S. dollars to China, with conditions similar to the military and economic aid programs for Greece and Turkey. The period for granting or withdrawing this loan is only two months away, and the State Department is currently busy collecting opinions from all parties to decide how to handle it. According to reliable sources, the general view in Congress is that most people agree to extend the deadline of June 30 so that China has sufficient time to submit its plans for use, and then make a decision. However, Judd does not agree with this, and said that Sun Ke and Zhang Qun have now been appointed as Vice President of the Chinese National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan, which shows President Chiang's sincerity in "expanding the government." This is the prerequisite for the loan insisted upon by President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall. However, according to the opinion of State Department officials, China has almost no chance of obtaining a specific loan by June 30, and it is stated that the State Department will still insist that China submit its plans for use before lending any part of the loan. Therefore, when China submits this plan next month, it will not be approved and a large amount of loan will be granted. Regarding the extension of the deadline, State Department officials also stated that they have not heard of it, and believe that at least a decision will not be made within two weeks.

### Editorial: The Significance of Commemorating Labor Day

Today is "May 1st" Labor Day, the 62nd Labor Day since 1886. The use of "May 1st" to commemorate labor is meant to remember the day that European and American workers fought and shed blood after the Industrial Revolution. This anniversary has great significance for the international labor movement. They use this as a goal to demand the unity of laborers and fight for survival, which has a mission of social evolution. Social evolution is inherently peaceful and gradual, but only the Communist Party mistakenly believes that social evolution must go through class struggle and bloodshed. Therefore, for half a century, the International Communist Party has stained the solemn "May 1st" with fresh blood. This anniversary has its great significance in China. The Chinese national spirit is peace and unity, and there is no class opposition in Chinese society, which is very different from the situation in Europe and America. We Chinese value labor very much, and therefore we also value "May 1st" Labor Day. Today, not only working people are enthusiastically welcoming this great anniversary, but also all Chinese people, regardless of gender or class, are enthusiastically welcoming this solemn anniversary.

The Chinese nation is the most diligent nation in the world, and this spirit of hard work is the embodiment of labor. China has respected labor since ancient times and regards labor as a virtue. The instructions of the sages are seen in the classics, such as the "Book of Rites": "Labor first, then reward;" the "Book of Changes" says: "Pleasing to the people first, the people forget their labor." Guanzi said: "Enrich the people by teaching them to labor;" the "Analects" says: "When there is something to do, the disciples take on the labor." This illustrates that China was the first to advocate labor and encouraged later generations to establish the country and conduct themselves with labor. Therefore, the Qing scholar Yan Xizhai said: "If one person moves, then one person is strong; if one family moves, then one family is strong; if one country moves, then one country is strong." Our country has not only always valued labor, but also valued the comfort and happiness after labor. Looking at the lunar calendar festivals: the spring scenery is pleasant, with the Qingming Festival for sweeping tombs in the suburbs; early summer is exhausting, with the Dragon Boat Festival for dragon boat races; the autumn is clear and refreshing, with the Mid-Autumn Festival for moon gazing; the harsh winter has just passed, and the minor spring turns, with a respite from agricultural work, there is the New Year's Day to the Lantern Festival for rest and celebration. This is a good inspiration, giving laborers rest and encouraging laborers to share joy and happiness. Comparing this with the origin of today's Labor Day, we can see that our commemoration of labor is based on historical origins and social customs; it is not for a certain class, nor for struggle and bloodshed. We hope that those who commemorate Labor Day clearly understand this point.

Our country values labor and commemorates Labor Day for the peace and happiness of all mankind and for the progress of the entire society, creating a happy and prosperous environment. Unfortunately, after the war, people's lives are difficult, industry and commerce are declining, and the unemployment crisis is becoming increasingly serious, leading to various social problems one after another. Individual lives and social stability are facing significant threats. Therefore, today, on Labor Day, we raise two major important issues: social problems and labor problems, and we ask for the attention of politicians and jurists, and the understanding of people in society.

The solution to social problems should focus on social security; the solution to labor problems should focus on protecting labor. Looking at the governments of various European and American countries in recent years, whether in the executive or judicial branches, they have carefully planned for social security and labor protection, reversing the previous protection of capitalism and instead protecting laborism. Our country was founded on labor, and today, in this era, we should pay close attention to these two major issues, considering the domestic situation and looking at external trends. The Constitution promulgated on New Year's Day this year, in its Chapter 13 on Basic National Policies, put forward the policies of social security and labor protection. This is an extremely far-reaching national policy. However, the provisions of the Constitution are limited to a listing of principles, and the specific implementation and details still require the completion of laws in the legislature and then progress in the administration to achieve good results. We believe that social security should not only focus on social insurance and social services, but also on full employment. Protecting labor should not only focus on factory inspections, wage adjustments, and labor-management coordination, but also on reasonable working hours, compensation, and the establishment of entertainment systems, which can be considered progressive legislation. If we can do this, the so-called social problems and labor problems will naturally not exist or develop. If we can do this, it also demonstrates that our emphasis on labor is consistent from beginning to end.

In short, "May 1st" Labor Day is a sacred and solemn anniversary. Its significance is renewed daily with social evolution, and its mission is increased with peaceful and happy life. "May 1st" Labor Day is always new and always a sacred and solemn festival!

[United Press, Flushing, April 30] The efforts of five Arab countries to demand the termination of the British mandate and the independence of Palestine for immediate discussion by the United Nations Special Session seem to have failed today. As the Steering Committee prepares to reconvene at 11:00 AM this morning (midnight Shanghai time), the British and American delegations, supported by the Soviet Union, appear to have concentrated sufficient forces in the 14-nation Steering Committee to defeat the Arab countries' demand to make Palestine an independent state. Although Soviet representative Gromyko expressed sympathy for the Arab group's goal of making Palestine an independent democratic government, this action, coupled with the transformation of Latin American countries, which further supports the leadership of the United States, has actually guaranteed the failure of the Arab group's motion when the Steering Committee votes on it today. Currently, only Egypt and India are certain to vote in favor of adding the issues of trusteeship and independence to the agenda. The Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, Canada, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, and Equatorial Guinea have already announced their opposition. Although Poland has expressed its support, it will abstain from voting. Iraq, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia, although able to attend and speak, have no voting rights.

The Arab group has formed a united front, and the statements of various countries are quite consistent. The main points can be summarized as follows: (1) The Covenant of the League of Nations allows the people of Class A mandate territories to eventually become independent. Since the British mandate over Palestine belongs to a Class A mandate, the freedom of Palestine is actually in the hands of Britain. Palestine's preparation for freedom is as unquestionable as that of other Class A mandate countries in the past, such as Syria, Lebanon, Outer Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. (2) Unless the United Nations acts quickly, the current terrorist disturbances in Palestine are bound to spread to the Near East and Middle East before September. (3) When Palestine has already been recognized as independent, refusing its independence violates the mandate system. The Arab countries continue to form a united front. Last night, the Arab League discussed whether the Arab delegation might vote against the establishment of an investigation team if their motions fail. The Soviet Union and Poland expressed their support for a full discussion of the issues of trusteeship and independence as requested by the Arabs, but both countries also stated that they would rather debate this issue after the investigation rather than before the investigation. The US position, which is likely to be supported by the majority, is that all countries deeply hope for the independence of Palestine, but there are still conflicting opinions between Arabs and Jews on the form of independence to be adopted.

### Marshall Meets with Austin; US Opposes Jewish Representatives Having the Right to Speak

[Reuters, Washington, April 29] A State Department spokesman said that Secretary of State Marshall will meet with Austin, the US representative to the United Nations, tomorrow to discuss the policies of the United Nations and the debate on the Palestine issue at the Special General Assembly. Austin is scheduled to leave New York for the capital tonight.

[United Press, New York, April 30] According to reliable sources today, the US delegation opposes allowing any Jewish representatives to attend and speak when the United Nations Special Session discusses the Palestine issue, unless there are unexpected changes in the situation. According to the US delegation, since the United Nations is organized by countries, only national representatives have the right to attend and speak at the General Assembly. If Jewish groups have opinions, they can only submit them in writing or attend the investigation committee for questioning.

### Dulles Reports on the Foreign Ministers' Conference; Says the US Will Not Hesitate to Take Unilateral Action

[French News Agency, New York, April 29] Dulles, an advisor to Secretary of State Marshall and a prominent Republican, returned with Marshall from Moscow and gave a broadcast speech today reporting on the Foreign Ministers' Conference. He said that this conference has at least contributed to the determination of future US foreign policy. The reason why the Moscow conference could not reach an agreement on important issues was due to the attitude of the Soviet Union. A Germany restored according to the Soviet plan not only presents the danger of Germany becoming a highly industrialized country, but also the risk of Germany becoming a Soviet factory. If the Soviet Union's ideals are put into practice, Austria will be reduced to a puppet state. The US delegation has established a closer relationship with France in Moscow this time, and the United States will not hesitate to take unilateral decisions in the future, which seems necessary for the welfare of Europe.

The US does not want to be repaid for materials of a purely military nature or those destroyed during the war, and what it wants to be repaid for is industrial materials, now used by the Soviet Union to implement its five-year plan, estimated to be worth about 4.5 billion US dollars.

### Senate Foreign Relations Committee Unanimously Passes the US Foreign Aid Bill; The House of Representatives Plans to Reduce it to $200 Million

[French News Agency, Washington, April 29] Regarding the US bill to provide $350 million in aid to China, Greece, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and Austria, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a meeting to discuss it and it was unanimously passed. Afterwards, the chairman of the committee, Republican Senator Vandenberg, told the press that the Trieste area is also within the scope of this aid plan. In addition, it has been learned that when the House Foreign Affairs Committee met to discuss this aid bill, Republican Congressman Junkman proposed an amendment to reduce the aid to $200 million, which was passed by a vote of 165 to 138. Some congressmen wanted to restrict aid to countries controlled by the Soviet Union, but the Foreign Affairs Committee refused to accept this request. It is expected that the Senate will try to restore this aid plan to its original state as proposed by President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and State Department Assistant Clayton.

[French News Agency, Washington, April 29] Mexican President Alemán arrived in the United States for a visit today. President Truman personally welcomed him and said that the friendly relations between the two countries are sufficient to prove the spiritual strength of Pan-Americanism and also sufficient to prove that all countries in the Western Hemisphere can peacefully resolve all disputes.

### Report on the Moscow Conference Proceedings - Full Text of Marshall's Speech (Continued)

The Foreign Ministers' Conference participants apparently all agreed to establish a self-sufficient and democratic Germany, with various restrictions to prevent Germany from rearming.

Excessive Centralization of Power in the German Government is Inadvisable

The Central Government Issue - The degree of centralization of the future German government is an extremely important issue. It is understood that in a country like Germany, individual rights and association rights traditionally lack sufficient strength to control the exercise of government power. If power is excessively concentrated, it would be very dangerous. The Soviet Union seems to favor a strong central government. The United States and Britain oppose this type of government because it could easily transform into a regime similar to the Nazi group. Britain and the United States advocate strict limitations on the scope of power of the central government, with other powers reserved for the states or provinces. As for France's proposal, the central government should only have very limited responsibilities. They fear that the trick of Hitler's regime seizing national power in 1933 will be repeated tomorrow.

Under ordinary circumstances, countries always have differing opinions on the nature of government restructuring. However, in this case, it is mixed with a reasonable fear of the resurgence of German military power, as well as anxiety about the open or hidden desires of those with ulterior motives.

Germany's Economy - Regarding the nature of Germany's economic system and its relationship with Europe, various disagreements are even more serious and difficult to reconcile. Currently, Germany's economy is crippled due to the lack of unified action, and it is necessary to make an immediate decision to rebuild Germany to a self-sufficient state.

Regarding the desire for German economic unification, all parties unanimously declared their agreement, but when it came to discussing the practical conditions for managing this unification, everyone held their own views. One of the most serious difficulties encountered in the effort to achieve economic unification is the go-it-alone policy within the Soviet occupation zone, which disregards other occupation zones, and even if there are reports, very little is known about what is happening within the Soviet occupation zone. They have no intention of cooperation and refuse to declare the food situation and the extent and nature of the reparations taken from the Soviet occupation zone.

The Soviet Union is Unwilling to Cooperate in the Economic Merger of Germany

The Soviet Union's unwillingness to cooperate with us in establishing a balanced German economy in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement is the biggest obstacle to achieving a self-sufficient Germany capable of supplying its neighboring countries with coal and other essential goods. The coal and other essential goods of Germany's neighboring countries were originally mostly supplied by Germany. Britain and the United States have worked hard to win Soviet cooperation in this regard, but to no avail. Therefore, the two occupation zones of Britain and the United States merged to improve the German economic situation, which allows the free circulation of materials and products in the two occupation zones to achieve a regulatory effect. This merger has been relentlessly criticized by the Soviet Union, which believes that this is a violation of the Potsdam Agreement and a step towards splitting Germany. The Soviet Union's refusal to implement the agreement is the only reason for the merger, but the Soviet Union has failed to understand this point. We have no choice but to view it this way: the Soviet Union's criticism has no other intention than to cover up the fact that they have failed to fulfill the Potsdam Agreement on unifying the German economy. There is no doubt that if we take certain steps towards German economic unification, it will be much better than not taking any steps at all.

The issue of the nature of the control of the Ruhr industrial zone (Europe's largest coal-producing area and heavy industrial zone) is still the subject of debate. We should not decide on it merely for the sake of reaching an agreement, because extremely important considerations and future consequences are related to it. (To be continued)

### Improving Calculation Index - Seeking Thorough Resolution - Wu Kaixian and Shui Xiangyun Express Opinions

[Our Newspaper] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian and General Labor Union Chairman Shui Xiangyun yesterday spoke separately with reporters about the cost of living index issue.

Drafting a Plan - Awaiting Adoption

Director Wu stated: He holds great determination to seek a thorough solution. The Labor-Management Appraisal Committee small group meeting is scheduled to be held on May 3rd. At that time, relevant organizations such as the Industrial Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union will be invited to attend. During the meeting, the opinions of each attendee on this issue will be solicited, compiled, and then another meeting will be convened to decide on a plan to recommend to the central government for adoption. If Minister Gu is still in Shanghai at that time, he will be invited to attend the meeting. Director Wu also stated: It is rumored that the types of daily necessities used to calculate the differential allowance will be increased, but he has not considered it. Director Wu stated that he has drafted a plan, which will be studied and discussed with Minister Gu after he comes to Shanghai, and will await adoption by the central government. It cannot be publicly released at present.

Suggesting Seeking - A Democratic Approach

Shui Xiangyun stated: From a general perspective, it is inevitable that the index will be unfrozen. However, it is still impossible to unfreeze it completely. Currently, the opinions of various parties on this issue can be summarized as follows: (1) Those with a base salary of less than 50 yuan will have the index restored, and those with a base salary of more than 50 yuan will have it calculated with a discount. (2) The cost of living index will use the January figure of 8,000 times as the base, and then be issued with discounts according to the circumstances of each industry. (3) Conduct a class survey and separately assess wages for each industry. (4) Increase the types of goods used to calculate the differential allowance. It is still undecided which method the central government will choose to compensate workers' livelihoods. The General Labor Union, imprisoned and assessed the different situations of labor, management, and the government, and each has its own difficulties. All parties speak subjectively and neglect objective conditions and the environment. Therefore, it is suggested that the Social Affairs Bureau convene a talk between the government, the capital side, and the labor side to seek a solution in a democratic way. The fact that workers cannot maintain their livelihoods, that some factories will announce their closure, and that the government is in a difficult situation are all facts. Why don't we speak frankly and seek solutions together? The Social Affairs Bureau has adopted this suggestion and will convene this three-party talk after the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee opens a meeting on the issue of unfreezing the index on May 3rd. At that time, labor and management will each have more than ten representatives attending, and the government representatives will be the heads of various competent authorities.

[Another Report] Director Wu spoke with reporters yesterday: 'The factors that cause price increases and decreases are raw materials, sales channels, productivity, interest rates, and wages. Therefore, wages are only a small part of prices. If the cost of living index suddenly returns from more than 7,900 times in January to the current level it should be, he believes that it will not stimulate prices. And prices are absolutely sufficient to determine wages.'

Among them, ten pieces had been hoarded and unsold since they were distributed on May 23rd of last year until February 15th of this year. After the investigation, in addition to suspending further yarn distribution, the government will also recover the stored yarn at the original price.

### Young Woman Dies Tragically by the Blade in Houjiabang

Love Triangle Leads to Murder - The Murderer Xu A’gui was Immediately Arrested - Details of the Incident Given, Love Rival on the Run

[Our Newspaper] In front of the Dianye Public Office at No. 38 Wujia Lane, Houjiabang, in the city, at around 10:30 a.m. yesterday, a young woman was murdered at that location. Afterward, upon receiving the report, Deputy Chief Shen Deting and Chen Jingshan of the Yimiao Police Precinct personally led Criminal Section Chief Zhou Nan, section members Mai Wenlin, police chief Bai Faxiang, and police officers Gu Zhicheng, Li Xuewei, Ju Bin, Zhang Minghui, Chen Yuzhi, and Patrolman Yang Yiyi of the Fuyou Road Police Station to surround and search the area. They finally arrested the murderer Xu A’gui and brought him to the station.

According to the confession: The deceased was Wen Shunna, from Zhenze Town, Wujiang County, 26 years old. She had a husband named Xu Jinsheng in her hometown, who worked as a farmer. She had been carrying on an affair with him for about ten years. For this, she had sold two mu of cloud fields and a boat. In February of this year, they came to Shanghai together. Because it was difficult to find a house, she lived in the home of a fellow villager, Shen Hesheng, at No. 39 Wujia Lane, in the city, and made a living selling pickled mustard greens. The deceased was employed as a maid at No. 27 Zhengxiang Lane, Fangbang Road. The two still visited each other from time to time. The landlady of the Tan Maoxing anvil shop at No. 246 Pingjili Road, Tan Fei, was the sister-in-law of Shen Hesheng's wife. They often went back and forth, and the deceased got to know this old woman as a result. They talked congenially, and Madam Tan induced the deceased to have a relationship with her son, Tan Lianqian. Over time, he became very angry. Recently, because of a lack of capital for selling

discovered

pickled mustard greens, he returned to his hometown to raise funds. She also went with him. After delaying for a few days, they agreed to return to Shanghai on a certain day. Unexpectedly, the deceased left one day early. He tracked her down the next morning and arrived here. After discovering that the deceased had arrived in Shanghai that day, he went to Tan Maoxing to stay for the night. The night before, he had gone to the shop to visit her and was insulted by Tan Fei and her son. This aroused his intention to kill the woman. Before leaving, he agreed to meet at a teahouse in Laoximen at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to

reason

and invited the deceased, Wen Shunna, to attend and break off the relationship. Later, he heard that the other party had invited people, so he hesitated. Suddenly, Tan Fei, Wen Shunna, and Tan Xueqian (shop assistant) took a streetcar with two men in suits to Shen Hesheng's house to reason with him. The deceased's attitude was tough, which made his anger even more difficult to suppress. After a few minutes of negotiations, he invited the deceased out to talk. As soon as they reached the side of the road at the entrance of the lane, he took out a sharp blade (a fruit knife purchased from Zhang Dalong Scissors Shop on Yan Hai Road for 5,000 yuan in the early morning) and

stabbed

the deceased once in the left chest and once in the mouth. At that time, the deceased ran five or six steps with the wound and fell to the ground and died due to the vital parts being injured. At the same time, he ran away but was chased by Tan Xueqian and others. The police also surrounded the area, making it impossible for him to escape.

During the struggle, Tan's right rib was also stabbed with a knife, and the blood flowed non-stop. Fortunately, it was still minor. Later, he surrendered himself to the hospital for treatment. The deceased, Wen Shunna, was sent to Tongren Fuyuantang by car to await a report from the District Attorney's Office to send personnel for inspection. The murderer, Xu A’gui, Tan Fei, and others are now being held in the police station, awaiting the arrest of the fugitive Tan Lianqian for joint investigation.

### Garrison Command Expands Jurisdiction - Songjiang and Other Eight Districts Included - Reorganization of the Inspection Office's Mission

From now on, cases of banditry will be handled separately by the Police Bureau and the Military Police Corps. The Inspection Office will only be in an auxiliary position. However, in the event of major cases, the Inspection Office will still handle them.

### An Ideal Couple - Actually in China?

Mrs. Yang Enqi Says This - Separate for a Week Every Three Months

[Our Newspaper] Mrs. Yang Siqi, representative of the Paris Evening News, gave a public lecture at the Lyceum Theatre yesterday with the theme of "Traveling Around the World to Seek an Ideal Couple."

Mrs. Yang said: She traveled to the ends of the earth but could not find an ideal couple. Finally, she came to China and finally found them. This couple told her that there was no secret, it was very simple - they must separate for a week every three months to let the whole family rest. During this week, if it is necessary to talk, use words instead.

Mrs. Yang has only been in China for a few months, and she has already discovered an ideal couple in China. I wonder if the compatriots who grew up in the motherland have also had the same discovery? Whether or not the ideal couple cited by Mrs. Yang is considered suitable for reality and is agreed upon can only be answered by the readers themselves.

### Impersonating to Seize Enemy Property - Zheng Desheng Interrogated Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] Zheng Desheng, a suspect in the instigation of the assassination of Huang Bohui, the former owner of the Shishi Daily, was recently reported to the Ministry of National Defense by hardware merchant Chai Yonglie and firewood merchant Ruan Teng, who said that Zheng had used the name of a major general counselor of the Military Commission at the beginning of the victory to seize the Anli warehouse on Beizhe Jiangxi Road, Tiantong Road, and the Wujing Yanghang warehouse on Chengdu Road, Nanjing West Road, which stored more than 100 tons of enemy property such as electrical materials, copper wire, and steel. The Ministry of National Defense sent the case to the Shanghai High Procuratorate for investigation. Because Zheng was detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center for the assassination of Huang Bohui, he is currently being questioned and investigated by the District Procuratorate under the instruction of the High Procuratorate. Yesterday, the original informant Chai Yonglie was specially summoned for questioning, and Zheng was also summoned for interrogation. The defendant Zheng Desheng is a major criminal involved in two cases, and was returned to custody after interrogation.

### Indictment of Five Japanese and Korean War Criminals - Including Elements Who Used False Names to Form a Party to Plot Misconduct - Torture and Coercion to Confess, Cruel Harm to Our Compatriots

[Our Newspaper] Five war criminals were indicted by the military court yesterday: (1) Ikezaki Michinari, who served as the branch manager of Shanghai Meifeng Foreign Company, the deputy manager of East Asia Trading Company, and other positions. In July 1944, under the command of the "Ordnance Factory of the China Expeditionary Army Headquarters" of Japan, he organized a "party organ," served as the head of the organ, operated military supplies production, and manufactured hand grenades for the enemy army. After the end of the war, he used the pseudonym Tang Zhen, mixed into the Third Advance Army Headquarters of the Soviet-Zhejiang-Anhui Military Commission as a major staff officer, secretly organized the Yamato Party, and planned to recruit fugitive Japanese troops in the Soviet-Zhejiang provinces after surrender to plot misconduct. He was detected by the former Third Front Army Jinghu Area Prisoner of War Management Office, detained, and sent to the military court for trial. (2) Korean Jiang Jianghu, formerly the chief of the Special High Department of the Weijing Police Bureau in Muping County, Shandong Province. In 1944, our guerrilla team Sun Zhenxian's team killed a Japanese in Xitanjiabo Village in the county. The criminal arrested the village chief Liu Kunji and subjected him to torture such as hanging and waterboarding, forcing him to confess the hiding place of our guerrillas who killed the Japanese, and imprisoned him for more than 20 days before releasing him. After the victory, he was detained by the Qingdao Garrison Command and brought to justice. (3) Former Mochi Yuzuru, the captain of the squadron of the Qingdao Naval Special Base Fleet of the Japanese Navy, and (4) Fujiwara Keisuke, a third-class machine gunner of the first detachment, killed our government workers and innocent people. He often tied the convicts to trees and instructed the team soldiers to either chop off their heads with sharp blades or stab them with bayonets, which was extremely cruel. (5) Former Sergeant Major Kurakoshi Hakuji of the Shanghai Military Police Headquarters arrested Su Jiarong, an underground worker, and used torture to force him to confess, which was inhumane.

### Sinan Road Detention Center - Overcrowded - Sudden Increase in Criminals - Panic Over Prisoner Food - Currently Negotiating Purchase with the Social Affairs Bureau

[Our Newspaper] Since the Sinan Road Detention Center in this city handled the amnesty at the end of January this year, two-thirds of the prisoners originally in the prison have been released, leaving only 749 people at the minimum. However, since the beginning of spring, the number of criminals has suddenly increased. Many of the criminals who were released after the amnesty have returned one after another because they have committed crimes again. As of yesterday, the total number of prisoners in the office reached 2,073, exceeding the number before the amnesty. All the prison cells are full, and an average of 50 or 60 new criminals are constantly being sent in every day. There are not enough prison cells to be distributed, so the newly imprisoned people have to temporarily settle in the corridor. The more serious problem is that the prisoner food will also be insufficient. Director Tian Lixun told reporters yesterday that the office currently has enough rice to last only one day, and there is a danger of having no rice to cook tomorrow. Director Tian went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to visit Director Wu Kaixian the day before yesterday and applied to purchase 1,000 zu of red rice to supply the four institutions of the Detention Center, the Temporary Detention Center, the Shanghai Prison, and the High Court Temporary Detention Center. Yesterday, he contacted Ji Mingzhai, Section Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. Because rice prices have been soaring for days, the Social Affairs Bureau is planning to sell a large amount of its existing rice reserves to try to suppress the price, so it is not yet known whether the 1,000 dan of prisoner food can be fully approved. However, according to Director Tian, even if it cannot be fully purchased, a small amount must be handled, and a tragedy of food shortages may not occur. Director Tian also informed that each prisoner is given 20 taels of food per day, and currently consumes about 17 dan of rice per day, and said that the shortage of food this time is because the number of people decreased after the amnesty, and not much was prepared, and after the number of prisoners suddenly increased in the past half month, it coincided with the soaring food prices, resulting in an unprecedented food shortage. According to the office's food account, there is already no grain left. The remaining rice today is the surplus from the previous month. He also said that fortunately, the prisoner food expenses can be reimbursed according to the actual situation, otherwise it would be impossible to raise funds.

### Transgender Person's Physiology Shows No Abnormality; Three Women Remain Deluded; Sharing Food and Clothes in Prison

[Report from Our Newspaper] Shen Junru, the "transgender person" arrested by the Municipal Police Bureau in a den discovered at No. 1327 Fuxing Middle Road, Elizabeth Apartment, and the deceived women Zhou Shuzhen, Ding Baoshu, and Fan Guanheng, along with the "transgender person's" personal maids Xu Aqiao and Zhang Xiuzhen, were transferred to the District Court on the 28th on charges of drug offenses and offenses against public morals. They were detained in the temporary detention center for women attached to the District Court. The detention center, considering the special nature of the "transgender person," did not allow them to be mixed with other inmates and instead kept them in a "special room" individually. The court has dispatched a forensic doctor to examine the "transgender person's" physiological condition, and the results prove that the "transgender person" is a normal woman and has no special abnormalities. It is reported that when ordered to change into women's clothing upon entering prison, the "transgender person" insisted on refusing because they had no women's clothing. The detention center ordered them to wear prison clothes. After hearing this, the three deceived women each took off their own clothes and gave them to the "transgender person," and pleaded on their behalf to avoid being forced to change into prison clothes. Zhou Shuzhen, Ding Baoshu, and Fan Guanheng are all abandoned women, wealthy widows, who possess huge amounts of property. After being detained, their relatives sent them exquisite dishes. The three women transferred part of their own food to the "transgender person." Zhou, Ding, and Fan's actions of sharing food and clothes in this way prove that they are still deluded. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter went to the temporary detention center and saw the "transgender person" wearing a light green short jacket, purple long pants, and black soft satin men's cloth-bottomed shoes, pacing back and forth in the room. Because the clothing was neither one thing nor another, it was quite laughable to look at. When they noticed someone coming to visit, they immediately burrowed into the quilt and covered their head, seemingly knowing shame and being afraid of being seen. According to the court, the case will be tried in a few days. The drug offense part is still awaiting court appraisal, and it will be difficult to grant bail to the three women, Ding, Zhou, and Fan, before the trial concludes.

### China Reclaims Victory Over America, Wins Roosevelt Cup, Reversing Defeat in the Last Two Minutes

[Report from Our Newspaper] The second fierce battle of the Roosevelt Cup Sino-American basketball tournament was held last night at the city gymnasium, with over three thousand spectators. Throughout the game, the American team consistently led, disappointing the audience. Unexpectedly, in the last two minutes, the Chinese team awoke like a sleeping lion, reversing the situation with a score of sixty to fifty-seven, defeating the American team and winning the championship. The audience's worries turned to joy, and they were ecstatic. The Chinese team frequently adjusted its lineup due to being at a disadvantage, while the American team ultimately suffered the consequences of "carelessness losing Jingzhou." For thirty-eight minutes, the Chinese team had little to commend, with a scattered and disorganized state often seen. Only in the last two minutes did they show their true colors. Good luck also played a significant role.

The game started at 7:35 PM. Both sides began with the same lineup as in the first game. The audience frequently urged the teams on, with applause and cheers rising together. Upon initial contact, Brochie of the American team immediately scored five points. Chen Xuechong of the Chinese team made a basket from the left corner. Brochie attacked again, and with no one guarding him, he easily scored another basket. Following this, Trimier scored, making it 9-2. The Chinese team had to reorganize, replacing Liu Fushan with Cai Yanxiong. The Chinese team's situation gradually improved, but they committed numerous fouls, all of which were converted into points by the opponent, making it 15-6. Liu and Cai switched again. Bao Songyuan added three points, and the American team called a timeout. Wu Chengzhang's shot was accurate, making it 17-13, closing the gap. When Whiteford replaced Asche at fifteen minutes, Chen Xuechong received excellent support from Zhenzhong, making it 19-18, only one point behind. The American team called another timeout. Asche re-entered, and with excellent teamwork, added seven points, reaching twenty-six. The audience worried for the Chinese team. The first half ended with a score of 30-21, with the American team leading by nine points. During the intermission, the Mayor's Cup awards were presented. The Mayor was absent, so Section Chief Zhang Peter of the Social Affairs Bureau represented him. The Columbus team, champions of the men's division, was led by Brochie to receive the award. The entire team smiled broadly, expressing their appreciation and joy for the silver cup.

The second half began with Lao Bao intercepting Brochie's high ball under the basket. He passed the ball to Cai Yanxiong, who quickly passed it to Xuechong, who scored. The action was crisp, and the audience was very satisfied. At 33-25, Zhenzhong was replaced by Fushan. Brussie's sprinting made the Chinese generals dumbfounded. At 39-26, the Chinese team called their fifth timeout. Asche was so agile that sometimes two people could hardly contain him. When the scoreboard clock pointed to thirty minutes, the score was 49-32. Lin Weicong replaced Cai Yanxiong, and Ma Canxi replaced Chen Xuechong. The Chinese team's score, after the rapid chase by Lin, Li, etc., showed signs of revival. At 53-44, Oberlin "graduated," and Little John replaced him. Ren Zhang, Songyuan, Xuechong, Lao Bao, etc., fought hard to tie the score at 53. At the last two minutes, Wu Chengzhang scored a basket, exceeding the score by two points. Asche made it 55-55. Big John committed a foul, and Chengzhang made one free throw. Xuechong scored, reversing the situation to 58-55. The atmosphere in the gymnasium was wild. Little John scored a basket, increasing the score to 57. Cai Yanxiong scored the final basket, and the game ended. The Chinese team reversed the defeat with a score of 60-57.

Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, and Yu Ruizhang each scored more than 14 points, making great contributions. They will meet another strong local team, the Navy, tomorrow.

### Production Area Prices Rise, Production Volume Low, Edible Oil Reaches New High Prices

Our Factory Soybean Oil Jumps 30,000 Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the edible oil market continued to rise sharply, with prices for all types of edible oil reaching new highs. Soybean oil from our factory was 580,000 yuan, up 30,000 yuan. Qingdao Jeep barrel raw oil was 600,000 yuan, up 20,000 yuan. Pure raw oil was 550,000 yuan, up 20,000 yuan. Prices in the production areas also continued to rise. Wuxi was 630,000 yuan, Changzhou was 620,000 yuan, and Qingdao was 430,000 yuan. Although Yingkou was cheaper, transportation was difficult, and even if goods were shipped out, most were transported to the North China Tianjin area for sales. Private oil factories in the city all felt a shortage of raw materials, resulting in low production volumes and even lower sales. If oil were extracted at the current raw material prices, the income from oil extraction would only be enough to cover the raw material costs, leaving nothing for labor and other expenses. In Bengbu, Hankou, and other places, the quality of raw materials was inferior, but the face sales price was even higher, making it impossible to use.

Edible Oil Merchants Plan to Form a Joint Management Office

[Report from Our Newspaper] In response to the recent soaring oil prices in Shanghai, the Shanghai Edible Oil Commercial Guild believes that the edible oil allocation office is unable to cope. Therefore, they plan to establish a joint edible oil management office and have submitted a request to Mayor Wu for approval. The planned joint edible oil management office will be based on all wholesale group members of the Edible Oil Guild, targeting retail group members. The fixed capital is 100 million yuan, with shares divided into different levels and paid in installments. Subsequently, all edible oil produced by Chinese-owned oil factories and private factories in the city will be purchased by the Guild's joint management office at negotiated prices and distributed to all retail group members and members of the sauce garden and brewing industry guilds. If there is a shortage, the wholesale group members will be responsible for transportation to ensure supply.

Allocation Office to Expand Organization

The fourth meeting of the National Economic Council decided to stabilize edible oil prices in Shanghai. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, the China Plant Oil Factory of the Ministry of Food, the China Edible Oil Company, and the Oil Extraction Industry Guild will jointly establish a unified allocation office for edible oil. Yesterday, a telegram with the reference number Jingwu Zi 16 was sent to the city government, requesting investigation and handling. The Social Affairs Bureau's supervisor, Li, will expand the organization of the edible oil allocation office within the week and uniformly register retail shops. The total number of retail shops currently allocated by the allocation office and China Plant Oil Company is 1,800. After review, this number will be reduced to 800.

Northeast Soybeans Arrive Within Days

Another report: The first batch of 6,000 tons of soybeans purchased in the Northeast by the China Trust Bureau and various banks will arrive in Shanghai within days. It is said that this batch of soybeans is specifically for oil extraction by Shanghai oil factories.

It is also learned that the China Trust Bureau has only completed two soybean trades with foreign countries. One is with Italy, amounting to 13,200 tons, and the other is with the Netherlands, amounting to 5,000 tons.

### Depleted Sources, Scarce Arrivals, Rice Prices Reach New Peak, Flour and Grains Also Increase Linearly

[Report from Our Newspaper] Rice, beans, flour, and grains all rose sharply yesterday, reaching new highs. Black market white japonica rice exceeded 200,000 yuan, and white yuan reached 230,000 yuan. Due to chaotic price increases in the production areas and depleted sources, only 1,315 shi arrived at the city market yesterday. Samples from various sources were almost completely exhausted, and market transactions were virtually suspended. Apart from a small amount of allocated rice for door-to-door sales, most rice shops were empty. The Social Affairs Bureau released a total of 9,000 bags of white rice and Siamese rice into the market yesterday. Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai from Beijing this morning and is expected to bring back countermeasures for the city's food problem from the National Price Conference.

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau analyzed the reasons for the rising prices to reporters yesterday, believing that it was not due to artificial factors. The government has very strict controls on this, and with the rainy season approaching soon, no one dares to hoard large quantities.

Yesterday, wheat flour rose to 130,000 yuan, a jump of 13,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Domestic flour was 89,000 yuan, up 7,500 yuan. Dalian green beans were 163,000 yuan, 23,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Pudong Du beans were 185,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan higher. Bran was 69,000 yuan, up 6,000 yuan. Jiangbei corn was 89,000 yuan, up 9,000 yuan. Chongming sand red beans were 195,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. Changzi soybean cake was 56,000 yuan, up 4,500 yuan. Yingkou soybean cake was 88,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan.

### Sugar Price Increase Slightly Calmed

The sugar market's rising trend slightly calmed yesterday, but still increased by ten thousand to several thousand yuan. Peruvian fine sand was 428,000 to 4,000 yuan, up ten thousand to six thousand yuan. Coarse white and medium sand also increased by about ten thousand yuan. Green sugar was relatively flat. Shantou green sugar had no Xuan Qing, Gao Shunde green was 260,000 yuan, followed by 255,000 yuan, Diao Qing was 242,000 to 250,000 yuan, Gao Xinghua white was 420,000 to 400,000 yuan, Gao Xinghua red was 330,500 yuan to 300,000 yuan, and Extra Gao Shantou white was 440,000 yuan.

### Additional Collateral for Tea Leaves Reaches 16 Billion

The China Farmers Bank has been handling additional collateral loans for tea merchants for a month. It is reported that the bank has lent out more than 16 billion yuan to date. Only a small portion of the tea leaves from last year's tea loans has not been processed for additional collateral. It is expected to be completed next week, with the total additional collateral loan being around 20 billion yuan.

### Longjing Declines Openly, Flat Secretly

New Hangzhou Longjing tea continues to arrive, but it is all from the third or fourth batches, and the quality is far inferior to the previous fresh and tender teas. Therefore, the prices offered by traders to each other have been reduced again, but the underlying trend is that the decline continues openly while remaining stable in secret. Other varieties still only include the 1946 Bailin black tea. The Yingkou gang is still inquiring, but the rest are not selling well, and the situation remains unchanged. The foreign tea market's appetite remains narrow, and the attitude is stubborn. They are selective, so negotiations are difficult to succeed, and the volume of transactions is not exciting. The market is still inflated as before.

### Chairman of the Banking Association, Li Fusun, Takes Office

After the National Banking Association Joint Conference closed in Beijing, it held a temporary board of directors meeting at the Shanghai Banking Association yesterday (30th). More than 30 directors and supervisors attended. Mr. Du Yuesheng served as the temporary chairman and unanimously welcomed Chairman Li Fusun to take office. Mr. Li delivered an inaugural speech on the spot and then presided over the meeting to continue discussing the progress of the association's affairs. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.

### Cotton Fabric Market Remains Firm

The cotton fabric market initially saw strong rumors that cotton yarn prices would be raised, causing the market to surge. The Four Gentlemen, Golden Seal, and Yuan Biji fabrics were widely absorbed, with prices reaching as high as 242,000 yuan. Holders still planned to maintain prices. Twenty-count unlicensed fine cloth rose from 219,000 yuan to 242,000 yuan due to limited allocations from the Textile Construction Company the day before. Leading fine cloth also rose to 270,000 yuan. Other white and colored fabrics, such as Shilin, all showed stability.

### Market Sentiment Firm, Chinese Stocks Continue to Advance

Chinese stocks remained firm yesterday. Silk prices soared, and secondary and miscellaneous stocks continued to advance, bringing up Yong yarn as well, which was relatively cheap. The key issue for the future will be the money supply.

At the start of the morning, all stocks rose, except for Deli Yong yarn. After the opening, 231, 153, 78, 97, 98, and 125 were offered for sale, falling from 4,900 yuan to 4,800 yuan. The Meea and other secondary stocks were initially reported lower but then rose steadily. 153, 76, 112, 116, 117, 226, 223, 106, 4, 13, 89, 142, 129, and 224 took the opportunity to buy, gradually rising back to 5,000 yuan. 117 and 160 settled, showing slight fluctuations. When China Silk and Five Harmony reached their limit, 106, 117, 4, 94, 89, 95, and 224 further advanced to 5,080 yuan. 14 and 95 advanced again to 5,100 yuan. New Asia also announced a price freeze. 163, 91, 107, and 137 settled at high prices, falling back to 4,980 yuan. 126, 106, 95, 231, and 89 all advanced. At noon, Deli Yong yarn was raised to around 5,150 yuan and then stabilized slightly. After the close, the asking price was raised to 5,180 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Ji Yong yarn, Meea, New China, and Hua Feng each rose by more than half a percent. The Sino-French remained flat, New Light and Jingfu rose slightly, Yong Gong rose slightly, Qin Xing rose by half, and Xinyi had no transactions. For deferred delivery, Xinyi and Jingfu rose slightly, New Light was flat, and Yong Gong, Hua Feng, Yong yarn, and Meea each rose by about half a percent. Among the cold stocks, China Silk and New Asia hit the limit, domestic underwear was stable, Tong Yi rose slightly, and Five Harmony hit the limit. The remaining stocks each rose by more than half a percent.

In the afternoon, only spot transactions were conducted. China Silk, New Asia, Rongfeng, and Commercial Affairs first announced price freezes. Yong yarn was advanced by 142, 232, 170, and 223, rising to 5,260 yuan. 94 and 107 sold off, retreating to 5,210 yuan. 160, 223, 224, 185, 94, and 85 fiercely bought in. Jinglun Firecrackers, New China, Five Harmony, Yong Gong Cement, Qin Xing, Jiu Fu, and Datong successively reached their limit, raising Yong yarn to 5,310 yuan. 63, 31, 104, 76, 188, and 14 were sold, falling back to 5,200 yuan. Under the support of 223, 145, and 105, there were rumors of differences in the four lines and two bureaus. After 3 o'clock, it rose again to 5,300 yuan. This news was actually a false rumor. 215, 60, 177, and 62 successively sold off, forcing the price down to a low of 5,190 yuan before stabilizing. It rose slightly after the close. As a result, compared to the previous close, Qin Xing, New China, and Yong Gong hit the limit, Sino-French rose by 10%, Xinyi and Meea rose slightly less than 10%, and Yong yarn, Jingfu, and Hua Feng rose by slightly more than half a percent. New Light rose slightly. There was only half a day of trading for deferred delivery. New Light was flat, Jingfu and Xinyi rose slightly, and Yong yarn, Meea, Yong Gong, and Hua Feng each rose by about half a percent.

China Textile and Rong Feng rose after hitting the limit, each rising within 10%. Underwear rose by half a percent. Yongye rose sharply and then quickly fell back, resulting in a low result. Among the off-market stocks, Five Continents was flat, and the remaining stocks each rose slightly, up to half a percent. Dasheng's rising trend was the most significant.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Stimulates, Foreign Stocks Rebound

Foreign stocks rose after initially falling yesterday, mainly because the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate narrowed again. Jardine Matheson opened at 600,000 yuan, rose from 603,000 yuan, was pressured down to 591,000 yuan by securities firms and retail buyers settling. The Guangdong gang came in and stabilized, then was stimulated by the Hong Kong exchange rate, approaching 610,000 yuan at the close in the afternoon. Trading of Jardine Matheson was quite lively. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, British United, and Kaiping Paper each rose by more than half a percent, and the rest rose slightly.

Rooms 503, 552, and Taifeng all sold, with about 6-7 million transactions. As a result, compared to the previous close, A, B, and E each fell by 400 yuan, while C and D were slightly mixed.

### Ministry of Finance Convenes Meeting to Discuss Grain Export

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting at the Central Bank at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the quantitative export licensing methods for soybeans, sesame, peanuts, rapeseed, and their extracted oils. Representatives from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Export Promotion Committee attended the meeting. Zhang Fuyun represented the Ministry of Finance and chaired the meeting. After discussion, it was proposed to submit a request to the authorities to designate a specialized agency to be responsible for the licensing matters. At the same time, it is necessary to investigate the current domestic production volume of the above raw materials and their extracted oils, the domestic demand, and the quantity available for export in order to determine the accurate export volume.

In another report, the Central Trust Bureau received a report from New York observing the world oilseed market, believing that the supply of oilseeds in the international market has been excessive recently. The United States also has a considerable production of soybeans. Furthermore, in recent months, the rate of increase in international oil prices has exceeded the general rate of increase in prices, so it is predicted that the trend of international oil futures market will weaken.

### Following the Price Control Committee's Resolution: Textile Construction Adjusted Yarn Prices Yesterday

Fourth Month Pricing Also Decided by the Committee

[Report from this Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company began selling yarn yesterday according to the new negotiated prices for cotton yarn discussed and decided by the National Price Control Committee. The selling price for 20-count standard yarn is 4.6 million yuan per piece. Details of the selling prices for other counts of cotton yarn can be found in the commercial section of this newspaper below. Yesterday, in addition to selling a certain number of pieces of 32-count double-strand and 42-count double-strand cotton yarn on its own, the company also sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Committee as usual, selling a total of 1,697 pieces of various counts of yarn, including 1,343 pieces for domestic manufacturers and 354 pieces with yarn numbers. A total of 554 application forms were received from manufacturers, and 354 households applied for yarn numbers.

This reporter interviewed Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, yesterday. He had just returned to Shanghai after attending the National Price Control Committee meeting. He told the reporter that the National Price Control Committee felt that the Shanghai pricing negotiations were indecisive and not a good strategy. Therefore, based on the cost of cotton supplied by the Joint Headquarters and quota-imported cotton, plus processing fees and legitimate profits, the fourth-month negotiated price was determined to be 4.6 million yuan per piece for 20-count standard yarn. This is about 27% higher than the negotiated price of 3.7 million yuan in March. The prices of other yarn counts are determined proportionally based on cotton prices. The purchase price is the same. Regarding the current yarn and cloth issues, he listed several points to report to the National Price Control Committee: (1) Cotton Issues: The cotton shortage is a major cause of the recent yarn and cloth price increases. In the past, factories had an average of four to five months of cotton inventory, but now there is an extreme shortage. Quota-imported cotton cannot arrive in Shanghai as scheduled, and new domestic cotton will not be available until late October at the earliest, or late December to early January at the absolute earliest, which is too slow to alleviate the problem. Therefore, factories are panicked about the cotton supply and are willing to buy cotton from the market at any cost, causing cotton prices to rise higher and higher. Therefore, the first step to solve the yarn and cloth problem is to ensure that cotton is supplied to factories on time and in sufficient quantities. (2) Although the current electricity supply situation has improved, there has been no significant increase in yarn and cloth production, and China Textile Construction Company is no exception. Internally, the company's employees are treated poorly, which affects production efficiency. Externally, China Textile Construction Company loses 4 to 5 billion yuan per day by selling yarn and cloth at prices set by the government. It seems that the Price Control Committee should be asked to consider eliminating this contradictory phenomenon. (3) Regarding his views on the general situation of yarn and cloth, he believes that the current rapid rise in prices means that the cost of yarn and cloth reproduction should be considered. Therefore, the evaluation should be slightly more lenient, but the control should be strictly enforced.

It is reported that due to the repeated increases in yarn and cloth market prices in various regions, some members of the National Price Control Committee believe that the government is currently supplying foreign exchange for cotton purchases and is also finding ways to coordinate the purchase of domestic cotton funds. The government has invisibly grasped the supply of raw materials for yarn and cloth, so the market price of yarn and cloth should be reasonably controlled. It is generally expected that the government will issue more effective control measures in the near future. It is heard that the Shanghai private yarn factory's proposal for a unified production and sales plan for cotton yarn was considered to have considerable merit by the Price Control Committee and has been kept on file for reference.

Timber Slightly Recovers

As the market price of fir wood rose, sellers took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the market price slightly recovered. The price of foreign pine remains stable.

### A New Path for the Labor Movement

— Ma Chaojun

The labor movement has been a worldwide trend since the 19th century. In this great movement, due to the different economic development situations in various countries, there are differences in the nature of the labor movement between industrialized countries and economically backward countries. In the early days, the working class in industrialized Western European countries was weak in both politics and economics. In politics, they were the ruled, and the parties representing labor occupied a very weak position in politics. In economics, they were exploited, and the fruits of economic (workers') progress were almost entirely enjoyed by the bourgeoisie. The lives of the working class were very difficult. Under these circumstances, the purpose of the labor movement in the short term was to demand increased wages and reduced working hours to improve daily life, and in the long term to implement social revolution.

Means of the Labor Movement

The means of the labor movement are, on the one hand, to organize labor groups, implement collective bargaining, and use strikes, walkouts, violence, or other similar methods when necessary to achieve their demands. On the other hand, it is to organize labor parties to implement various reforms in a bloody or bloodless manner. Later, labor groups became increasingly sound, and the power of labor could be manifested anytime and anywhere. If the Labor Party is in power, it uses political power to formulate various laws and regulations or programs related to labor to improve the political status of labor, increase labor welfare, and improve the working environment and daily life of labor. As for economically backward countries, the situation of the labor movement is completely different. Economically backward countries are still stuck in the stage of agricultural society, and the division of economic classes is not obvious. Therefore, many unreasonable labor problems caused by the "industrial" development of modern capitalist society do not yet exist in these countries. The mission and tasks of their workers are also different from those of workers in Western European countries. The nature of the labor movement is also different.

Economically Backward Countries

What path should the labor movement take in economically backward countries? First of all, we should pay attention to several characteristics of economically backward countries. First, in these countries, the exploitation and oppression suffered by the working class are far more serious than in other countries, and the labor movement is more urgently needed. Second, in these countries, industry is underdeveloped, the number of workers is small, and organization is not easy, so they are unable to resist capitalists. Therefore, the labor movement is not easy to promote. Third, these countries have lower living standards than economically developed countries due to backward production. They must concentrate all their efforts to rapidly increase and improve production in order to improve their living conditions. Fourth, these countries must have political and economic stability in order to concentrate all their efforts on production or industrialization. Fifth, according to the development of the socio-economy, these countries must implement industrialization. After industrialization, the number of workers will inevitably increase, and many labor problems in capitalist society may arise. From these five points, we know that the labor movement in economically backward countries needs to be developed urgently, but the labor movement in these countries cannot adopt methods such as strikes, walkouts, or violence to disrupt social order and reduce production like the labor movement in capitalist societies, which would make the labor movement lose its meaning. We believe that the only reasonable solution is to alleviate the economic oppression suffered by labor, assist in strengthening labor organizations, support the political status of labor, and protect the rights that labor should have, on the one hand, and persuade labor to cooperate with other classes and strive to increase production and complete the arduous task of industrialization, guaranteeing that the fruits of industrialization are reasonably distributed for the enjoyment of the laboring masses. If this path is adopted, the economic life of labor can be improved, the political status can be improved, and many labor problems can be solved accordingly. Strikes and walkouts are unnecessary actions.

Characteristics of the Chinese Labor Movement

China is an economically backward country, and it also has several characteristics of general economically backward countries. Therefore, the nature of the Chinese labor movement is generally the same as that of other economically backward countries. Therefore, the labor policy of our party is based on the spirit of labor-capital cooperation, focusing on the needs of the country, on the one hand, ensuring the economic interests and political status of labor, so that the Chinese labor movement does not have to use strikes and walkouts to demand increased wages and reduced working hours, and that the Chinese labor movement does not have to use bloody or bloodless means to fight for its political status, and on the other hand, seeking to improve the work efficiency of labor to increase production, promote the prosperity of national industry, and complete the task of national construction. Therefore, the labor movement in our country should earnestly follow the labor policy of our party and strive to promote the following path.

Labor Organization and Democracy

(1) Improve the organization of labor itself and cultivate a democratic atmosphere: The purpose of labor organizations is to use collective strength to seek legitimate economic and political rights and interests. In the future, China's politics will tend to democratize, and China's economy will tend to industrialize. The importance of a sound organization for labor is becoming more and more urgent. Therefore, I hope that labor comrades will recognize the importance of their own organization and quickly participate in the legal labor union. The so-called cultivation of a democratic atmosphere refers to the fact that the organization, actions, and activities of labor should be subject to the will of the majority, respect the interests of the majority, and make the development of the labor movement on the right track, and enable the foundation of our country's democratic politics to be established.

Promote Labor-Capital Coordination

(2) Promote labor-capital coordination: In our country, because industry is underdeveloped and class concepts are not obvious, the current labor-capital problem is not a labor-capital opposition problem, but a labor-capital cooperation problem. The labor-capital disputes that have occurred in various places are mostly due to price factors and less due to class contradictions. Therefore, the labor and capital of our country should join hands to jointly devote themselves to the great cause of national construction in order to enhance each other's welfare.

Increase National Consciousness

(3) Enhance national and national consciousness: Enhancing national and national consciousness is based on the principle of reducing class consciousness and coordinating people's consciousness. We should unite and cooperate to avoid struggle, so that human and capital resources are not wasted, and concentrate all our efforts to develop national industry, so that the Three Principles of the People can be realized as soon as possible, the country can be prosperous, and the living standards of labor comrades can be improved.

Improve Work Rate

(4) Improve work efficiency, strive to increase production, so that national income can be increased. Increased income can enable industrialization to be achieved at an early date, improve the living standards of labor, smoothly implement various social systems, and improve the political status of labor. During the Anti-Japanese War, our labor comrades were able to strive to increase production, enrich the strength of the Anti-Japanese War, and achieve victory. Now we must strive to increase production to complete the arduous task of national construction.

Comply with Labor Discipline

(5) Comply with labor discipline: The establishment of labor discipline and the welfare of workers themselves, industrial development are mutually causal. If labor is undisciplined and strikes at every turn, industrial production cannot be stabilized. As a result, industry is weak, factories close, and workers lose their jobs.

Wage Stability and Rationality

(6) Strive for the stability and rationality of wages: The wages of labor must be able to maintain a minimum living standard, but if wages are too high (exceeding the level that the national economy can afford), industry will not be able to maintain itself sooner or later. As a result, the number of unemployed workers will increase, national production will decrease, and inflation will increase. If production does not increase and the currency is unstable, the actual life of workers cannot be truly improved. Therefore, wages must strive for rationality and stability.

Restraint on Private Capital

(7) Restraint on private capital and development of state capital: so that the means of production will not fall behind in the hands of a few capitalists, the power of capitalists will not expand excessively, dominate the lives of workers, and the increase in the living standards of workers can be proportional to the degree of industrialization. Since the President led the party's revolution, and the Director-General inherited his legacy, he has paid close attention to the labor movement and has been able to follow the above points. Therefore, the party's national congresses and the Central Committee have detailed plans on how to solve the economic situation of labor and support their political status. The Labor Law, the Outline of Labor Policy, and the Outline for the Implementation of the Workers' Movement have been formulated one after another to protect and improve the lives of workers, relieve unemployment, actively guide workers to organize trade unions, and support their development, enhance the strength of labor itself, and strive for all the rights and interests that labor should enjoy. During the period of one-party rule of the party, the government also followed the party's established policy for labor comrades. In the economic aspect, it actively developed industry, so that labor comrades could be fully employed and improve their economic lives. In the political aspect, it guided them to participate in politics. In the legal aspect, it stipulated that the trade unions organized by our labor were legal persons. Among the 56 delegates of the vocational circles of the National Assembly, it stipulated that the number of delegates of our farmers and workers accounted for 60%. From this, it can be seen that the political status of our labor comrades has been increased in the Constitution, and our labor comrades have the opportunity to participate in politics. At present, the government's foundation has been expanded, and the constitutional period is near. The party is still fighting for our labor comrades based on the established labor policy, but I hope that my labor comrades will, based on the spirit of self-reliance, initiative, and independence, move forward in accordance with the labor policy of the party to strive for and maintain the rights and interests of labor comrades.

I have been engaged in the labor movement for more than 30 years. I know the suffering of labor comrades the most, and I am most eager to solve the suffering of labor comrades. This time, I am in charge of the Central Morning Labor Department, and I will take this opportunity to work with my labor comrades to develop the labor movement in our country to seek the true interests of labor comrades.

### Workers' Own Festival: Talking About the Future Direction of China's Labor Movement

— Lu Jingshi

"May 1st" Labor Day is coming again. This is a festival for workers themselves. We encounter this festival once a year. It is really unspeakable excitement and emotion. This year's Labor Day is even more worthy of our heated celebration, because our workers have done their best in this anti-aggression war, for the purpose of destroying barbaric and dark violence and fighting for freedom, progress and democracy. We finally won the victory. The biggest gain of this war is the establishment of the concept of economic democracy. We use the word "concept" here because it is still in the "conceptual stage" and has not formed a sound system. However, the trend is very obvious. People have felt that it is not enough for each person to have an election vote. Everyone must have food to eat. In other words, in addition to political democracy, there must be economic democracy.

In the United States, political democracy is fully developed. However, the opposition between the rich and the poor in economics is extremely obvious. The US government and all sectors of society have seen this and are trying to abandon the old capitalism and engage in the establishment of a new capitalism. They believe that the old capitalism is monopolistic and prevents others from competing, thus destroying the opportunities of the less powerful. The new capitalism wants to encourage competition and competition, not only for material things, but also for will leaders, positions and ideas, to give them opportunities to compete and make them reach reasonable standards, and at the same time to improve life.

In the United Kingdom, socialization of production plans is also being carried out on a large scale. Many transportation undertakings and heavy industries are implementing state-run and state-owned plans by the government. At the same time, the government regards the Beveridge Social Security Plan as the key to administration in order to maintain full employment and protect the basic living rights of the people. The government also wants to make efforts to ensure that anyone with the will to work, regardless of whether they can work, should have a minimum income, so that they can enjoy appropriate clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, hygiene, and the life of reproduction.

In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and in many countries in Europe, the post-war socio-economic system has a significant trend, which is to gradually move towards the direction of socialization. The acquisition of power by various political parties is through free and democratic methods, and at the same time, legal power is used to implement socialist improvement plans. All of this is roughly the same as our Principle of People's Livelihood in terms of ideals and practices. The Principle of People's Livelihood uses the method of "equalizing land ownership and regulating capital" to achieve bloodless economic reform. In other words, we want to appeal to reason, not to violence. The difference between the Principle of People's Livelihood and communism is: the former advocates class coordination, the latter advocates class struggle, the former implements constructive reforms, and the latter purely implements destruction and violence. However, this is contrary to the needs of our country's people and contrary to the spirit of our country and the direction of national construction.

The Most Blatant Destructive Force

The trend of the development of various regions in the world after the war is very obvious, but the efforts of governments and people of various countries have not completely overcome the economic panic, and the recession is still shrouded in every corner of the world. What is this for? First, the destruction of this war was too great, and it is not easy to recover in the short term. Second, the political and social instability of various countries has affected the progress of economic reconstruction. This phenomenon is especially profound in China.

The obstruction of China's reconstruction work and the destruction of the economic foundation are well-known facts. The Chinese Communist Party is the largest and most blatant destructive force. After Japan's surrender, the CCP continued to follow in the footsteps of the Japanese bandits, using all means of licentiousness, looting, robbery, and killing. At the same time, it destroyed transportation, destroyed industrial equipment, destroyed mines, and drove a large number of people to war and death. The CCP thought that this could not only drag down the government, but also create poverty, disease and famine, which could increase their "revolutionary" power.

Although the Communist Party's wishful thinking is like this, they did not expect that the foundation of the revolution cannot be built on the beach, and destruction alone is not necessarily revolution. Saying that the CCP's approach in China is bandit-style, there is no exaggeration of them. We have only seen the success of real revolutions in history, and we have not seen that bandits can conquer the world and consolidate it at the same time.

China, after eight years of hard-fought resistance, really cannot withstand any more destruction. The world has evolved to the atomic age, and whether it is our national defense industry or the general national economy, we are 108,000 miles behind. How can we survive in a world of the survival of the fittest? We should learn from the Soviet Union after the October Revolution and France after World War II, and bury our heads in hard work with the spirit of going to the national disaster. In this way, even if we cannot catch up, we will not be too far behind.

Labor Policy Measures

This is already the second Labor Day since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In this year and nine months, the government's labor policy measures and the route of labor movement development have been generally correct.

First of all, the government's policy of calculating wages based on the cost of living index is a wise and progressive measure. This method not only corrects the erroneous concept of "those who labor with their minds govern people, those who labor with their strength are governed by people" in China for many years, but also eliminates many unnecessary labor-capital disputes. Secondly, the government's policy of handling labor-capital disputes is also correct. As in the United States, the government uses mediation and evaluation methods to resolve labor-capital disputes, which is in line with democratic principles. In the process of mediation and evaluation, both labor and capital have representatives to participate. This can also promote labor-capital cooperation and enhance understanding between labor and capital.

Again, the government has also made its best efforts to support trade union organizations. At present, there are more than 7,000 industrial and vocational trade unions across the country, and most of them are very sound and pay close attention to the welfare of workers. When the constitution is implemented in the future, the relationship between trade unions and workers will be very important.

Furthermore, the Constitution promulgated on January 1 this year also has specific provisions for the protection of labor and social security. According to the Constitution, the state must not only protect the people's right to work, but also implement social insurance, implement women and children's welfare, promote health care, and public medical systems to protect the people's lives. These are all progressive measures that are in line with the trend of the times.

The task of the Chinese labor movement is arduous: First, it must seek the freedom and liberation of the nation and the freedom and liberation of labor itself. Second, it must fight for human justice and world peace. This requires long-term and unyielding struggle. To achieve this task, the direction of the Chinese labor movement in the future is as follows:

New Directions (1) Workers must participate in politics. Various trade unions should launch outstanding workers to participate in the election of national representatives and legislators, so that workers' representatives can participate in the legislative organs, supervise the government and fight for the status and reasonable life of workers, and promote the implementation of democratic politics.

(2) Step up labor education. The biggest obstacle to China's democratic politics is that education is not universal enough, especially among the working class. In the future, workers must understand and ask about politics, and labor education must be strengthened. Self-education should be carried out with tools such as film, drama, music, and art, and methods such as training classes and cram schools. Each trade union should take this as its central work.

(3) Promote work competition, promote labor-capital cooperation, improve machine equipment, improve work efficiency, develop production, and increase social wealth. China's economy is backward, and industry is depressed. The labor community must recognize the needs of the country, grasp the key points, and strive to move forward. Society should also cultivate a culture of valuing labor, so that everyone can use their hands and brains to work hard and increase production.

(4) Promote the organization of the National Federation of Trade Unions. It is a pity that the labor community does not yet have a national organization. In order to promote labor unity and assist in the implementation of constitutional government, the organization of the National Federation of Trade Unions is imperative. It is hoped that the organization of the National Federation of Trade Unions will be carried out after this year's "May 1st", and it is hoped that after it is established in the future, it will not only exert great power on the contact and unity of domestic workers, but also on international labor organizations.

### Nation Building Through Labor

— Wang Xielun

May 1st, is the glorious and beautiful anniversary of the world's workers. Regardless of country, race, gender, or age, all will greet this annual event with joy and excitement.

With labor, humanity can transition from being slaves of nature to masters of nature, from primitive to civilized, from cave dwelling and consuming raw food and blood to the atomic age. Labor is the mother of creation. We Chinese workers have built over 5,000 years of splendid culture with drops of sweat. Through our labor, we have conquered fierce birds and beasts, wind, thunder, water, and fire, slave owners, feudal lords, tyrannical monarchs, brutal warlords, and domineering imperialists, defeating countless historical criminals.

One share of labor, one share of harvest. Give one share of heat, emit one share of light. Freedom and happiness are not something that can be achieved overnight. Regardless of how the bloodthirsty scum within the country, who are prone to causing chaos, purely for their own and their party's interests, are destroying transportation, hindering construction, devastating the vitality of the nation, and ruining the nation's lifeline; regardless of how international neo-imperialists, arms dealers, warmongers, and financial speculators, purely for the vested and coveted interests of a few groups, are clamoring wildly, creating an atmosphere of killing and desperately launching and deploying a new world war; we know how to clearly recognize the country's and our own precise needs, we know how to temper ourselves in suffering, we know how to strengthen our will, we know what kind of path the creators and leaders of the Republic of China have shown us we should take.

We are honored that, on the soil of the Republic of China, especially in the recent half-century, so many brilliant and outstanding revolutionary movements and leaders of worker movements have emerged. They led us to fight against the Manchu Qing government, led us to fight against the Northern Warlords, and led us to fight against Japanese imperialists, and all achieved excellent results. Today, the constitution has been formulated, and the joint government has been established. Although there are thorns and obstacles on the road to a new China of democracy, freedom, prosperity, strength, and happiness, we have taken the first step of rebirth in these dark and turbulent times. Walking is always better than not walking, and doing is always better than not doing.

However, having said that, the actual work of nation-building is not as easy as empty talk. Industry is the backbone of a modern country, and workers are the real supporters of a modern country! We must not underestimate labor, let alone belittle ourselves. In peacetime, what aspect of clothing, food, housing, and transportation can do without workers? In wartime, what aspect of offense and defense, advance and retreat, can do without workers? On this riddled and troubled land of China, to build a modern nation of, by, and for the people, our work is urgently needed. In the current situation of chaos and fragmentation, with everything waiting to be rebuilt, we workers should build the nation with a pioneering spirit. Let us add a unique brilliance to the construction of the new China with our labor. (Shanghai, on the eve of the Labor Day in the thirty-sixth year)

### New Topics on Labor Movement on May 1st: Focus on Work, Supplemented by People

— Lu Keming

This year's commemoration of May 1st coincides with the time when our party (Kuomintang) is ending political tutelage and implementing the return of power to the people. Therefore, the new task entrusted to the labor movement by the times is: "How to guide the labor masses to correctly use their rights and powers." This is definitely not something that can be achieved through empty theories or passive discipline. We should inspire the labor masses to recognize their importance and cherish their interests. In other words, we want the labor masses to respect and value themselves. The strategy of "cadres decide everything" is no longer applicable today! Using cadres to lead the grassroots had more advantages than disadvantages during the period of political tutelage, but after the implementation of constitutionalism, it will have more disadvantages than advantages! Because the top-down leadership method often means that senior cadres only contact a part of the middle-level cadres, and the middle-level cadres maintain contact with the lower-level cadres. The broad labor masses are separated from the core organization by levels, forming, at best, an idolatrous blind worship of the overall movement policy and leaders, or only an indirect understanding. If the cadres are not sound, the labor masses' confidence in the entire policy will be shaken, and even doubts will arise. This system that relies on people is very dangerous. Therefore, today we should focus on work and supplement it with people in our labor movement. We should not create things because of people, but use people for the sake of things. In short, leadership should not be decided by a few cadres, but should consolidate the organization on the basis of welfare undertakings. What is especially important is to inspire laborers to participate and design automatically. The cadres responsible for leading laborers can no longer stubbornly maintain a high-handed and commanding style. They must replace it with a spirit of serving laborers, serving on the one hand and leading on the other, advancing on both sides, so that the labor masses feel that they are not being led, but experience the greatness of service enthusiasm. In the opportunity of service, patiently guide them to the broad road of self-motivation. This is an urgent innovation, and I would like to encourage all labor movement leaders together.

### Guidance on Selecting and Studying in University Departments

— Wu Daquan

Written by Du Zuozhou, etc., published by China Cultural Service Society

When young students enter university, which courses should they choose to study? Regarding this question, I think everyone can feel its importance. Many young people who have stepped out of the school gate and entered society often feel that "what they have learned is not useful" due to the difficulty of finding employment. Of course, the ultimate reason is that the various departments of social construction in our country are still unable to develop evenly, and at the same time, the personnel system is not yet on the right track. However, the selection of courses in school at the beginning is indeed the biggest cause.

"Guidance on Selecting and Studying in University Departments" helps students solve this difficult problem. Of course, it cannot be said that it already includes all university courses, but in the twenty-three articles in the book, it already includes thirteen different department courses. Almost every article is equivalent to an introduction to a subject. For a student who has not received proper guidance on methods of advancing to higher education, this is undoubtedly an excellent teacher and companion. It clearly analyzes and introduces the inside workings of each department and the preparations for admission, and then lets you assess your abilities, interests, aspirations, and future career prospects before selecting a subject.

Correcting students' concepts of any department is also deeply instructed in this book. For example, studying politics, because politics is not a practical science, and the path for studying politics is to become an official. It seems despicable to take becoming an official as the goal, which causes some young people to be unwilling to study it, but the author clearly points out "...if the most conscious and revolutionary young people now regard politics as a daunting task and are unwilling to study politics and engage in politics, and a group of unconscious and corrupt elements are appointed to political work, how can we expect progress in our country's politics?..." (See page 108) Another example is studying education. Some people may think that education is a hard work, and for personal gain, studying education is not suitable. But the author says: "...; Education is indeed hard, but there is joy in hardship. To appreciate the benefits, you must delve into it and devote yourself to it for life." (See page 72) From these two paragraphs, we are told that we must face the value of each course squarely. As long as you have achievements in your studies, the so-called "every profession produces an expert," each has its own way out. The question is whether you can work hard academically.

How to work hard in your studies after selecting a course is also something that every student should pay attention to. Many people often enter a department, study for a while, feel that it is difficult or boring, and then change to another course. Such a change of course will not only fail to achieve your goal, but will often lead to nothing. As the author says, "For a kind of learning, if you can persevere, your interest will gradually increase. As the saying goes, 'When skill is achieved through practice, pleasure naturally arises.'" Such encouragement and enlightenment, in addition to guiding us in selecting department courses, will also be of greater help in the progress of our studies.

"Studying blindly without interest is unfavorable to the country and the individual." Whether young people can develop and achieve success is related to the future destiny of the country. "Guidance on Selecting and Studying in University Departments" points out a clear path for us. "If this problem can be properly solved, not only can individual talents develop smoothly and concentrate on deepening their studies; the success of one's life career and the happiness of life will also be established here. At the same time, society and the country will also benefit from the healthy development of individuals, meet their needs, prosper their construction, and benefit from it."

### Maugham on His Recent Works

— Translated by Cai Xue

Somerset Maugham, a British writer who has been writing for fifty years and is now seventy-two years old, still looks so healthy, agile, and respectable. He says what he wants to say, and what he says is not necessarily what people want to hear. Unlike other celebrities, he doesn't feel he has any mystery; he has no "airs." His voice tells people that he is intelligent and kind; his eyes let us know that he still has some illusions about himself and others. In a crowded room, you may not have seen him, but he has already noticed you.

During the last war, he worked in intelligence and wrote the novel about a spy, "Ashenden." This time he is in the United States dedicated to improving Anglo-American relations. He also wrote a novel called "The Razor's Edge," which sold three million copies. Americans respect such an "ambassador." Someone asked him if the book sold so well because of its religious motivation. "Yes," he said, "From the letters I received, I am very sure of this; Americans are now dissatisfied with their philosophy of life. Power, money, and success have not brought them the results they hoped for."

He also said: "I plan to write two more books; a final collection of short stories, a novel about Spain during the time of Philip III—not historical—after which I will 'retire' and select and publish my notes, which I have been taking since I was eighteen."

Maugham went to the East after the last war, where he found the most perfect material. Apart from "The Painted Veil," Maugham showed the essence of his being a writer in these Eastern stories.

When asked how young writers should live, Maugham said, "Only two kinds of writers can live off their books—novelists and short story writers. No poet has ever done that."

He donated a sum of money to the Writers' Association to set up several travel grants. Those who receive this grant (four hundred pounds) should try to stay away as long as possible, with no other conditions.

What does Maugham think of the West? He said, "I am optimistic about the future; I don't believe there will be another war. I think Russia is now exhausted and somewhat fearful. We must find a way to reduce his fear. But what I fear is the United States. Now there are generals in the United States who think that Russia must be defeated while it is still weak; and there are businessmen who want to rule the world. The United States is somewhat anxious and neurotic. When people are nervous, they are prone to making mistakes."

Maugham does not intend to stay in the United States forever, although he likes Americans quite a bit. He misses Europe and plans to spend his remaining years in Cap Ferrat, France (where he has a villa). (This article is taken from Post)

### Recent Situation of the Japanese Publishing Industry

— Yu Shouzhong

In 1946, the Japanese publishing industry published a total of 2,702 first editions and 1,125 reprints, excluding magazines.

Based on this calculation, Japan published an average of more than ten kinds of books and magazines every day last year. But since this year, this number has increased again. Currently, Japan has an average of more than twenty kinds of books, including first editions and reprints, transported from printing houses to bookstores for sale every day.

In terms of content, new books are mostly in the category of literature and art. Among literary and artistic books, detective novels and popular novels are more common. Secondly, there are also many "complete works." From soft writers Riki Yumoto Okamoto, Mantaro Kubota, and Soseki Natsume to hard writers Kiyoshi Miki, Ikuo Oyama, and Minzo Kushida, the complete works have been published successively. In addition, complete works of European writers such as Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gide, and Valéry have also been published one after another.

In addition to literary and artistic books, there are also quite a few children's books, but most of them are reprints, and whether they are appropriate for modern children's psychology is questionable. The content of some children's magazines is even more outdated.

In terms of social sciences, socialist books have gradually decreased after the Yoshida Cabinet came to power. What has replaced them are more moderate books. However, books such as Masao Takahashi's "Words of Socialism", Masakazu Ibe's "History of the Development of Socialism", and Kenzo Kiga's "Theory of Modern Socialist Thought" are still popular.

Of course, books on democratic issues are popular for a while. However, the content is nothing special. At best, it has only changed from focusing on "quantity" in the past to focusing more on "quality" now. Among these books, Masanori Oshima's "Basic Concepts of Democracy" and Masamichi Shinmei's "Introduction to Democracy" have more readers.

Books on current affairs are very rare. Anti-Soviet things have a tendency to gradually rise. Books on reviewing the war are almost extinct.

After Japan's surrender, people from all walks of life often talked about why they were defeated. Most attributed it to the fact that science, technology, resources, and population were inferior to others. Few talked about the aggressive nature of this war and the responsibility that should be borne. The publishing industry is no exception. Recently, due to the evolution of the international situation and the gradual recovery of Japanese production, the past reflections on the war have long been forgotten. What is being discussed has become how to make Japan a strong country through the next war. The future trends of the Japanese publishing industry seem unlikely to deviate too far from this topic.

### Chinese Geography Textbook Map

— Lu Caihe, Sun Panshou

This atlas was compiled by Mr. Jin Qingyu of the "Chinese Historical and Geographical Atlas Compilation Society" and was revised and republished in December last year. When flipping through this atlas, the first impression is that the drawings are very detailed and aesthetically pleasing. There are a total of forty-six maps, with provincial maps accounting for thirty-one of them. The others are general maps of astronomy, the world, terrain, administrative divisions, river systems, climate, soil, population density, industry, transportation, and national defense. In front of these maps, there is a national three-dimensional terrain map rendered in natural colors, allowing readers to recognize the true appearance of our country's territory, which is a major feature of this map. The terrain map at the back is perfect in terms of accuracy and color. It is very interesting to study them in comparison with the three-dimensional map. The national river system map lists all the important rivers in the country without omission, and the division of their basins is also very reasonable. However, the term "river system flow machine" listed in the legend could be changed to "slope washing area," which would have a clearer meaning.

The population density map is very clear. As for the two industry maps, it is best to differentiate the various symbols by size according to their importance. For example, the Chengdu Plain produces rice, and the Hexi Corridor also produces rice, but the output of the two differs greatly. Therefore, the "rice" character printed on the Chengdu Plain may be larger, and the one printed on the Hexi Corridor may be smaller. This way, the person reading the map will naturally know where a certain industry is important and where it is secondary.

The content of the transportation map is very detailed. The distances between the main ports are explained separately in the lower left corner of the map, which has reference value. However, both highway lines and air routes are indicated in red, which easily confuses the perception of the person reading the map. It is better to use two colors. The air routes can be drawn thinner. If the navigable sections of waterway transportation can be indicated with symbols, readers can understand them at a glance, saving a lot of effort in flipping through newspapers and magazines. If you feel that a map contains too much material and the map is too messy and complex, you may wish to omit the provincial boundaries, otherwise draw two separate maps, because transportation is an important part of geography.

It is best to indicate important cities with red dots of different sizes according to the population level, so that it is more clear. Shanghai is our country's economic center, and Nanjing is our country's political center. It is very meaningful to combine them into a single map in this atlas. The astronomy map and the world map seem unnecessary to be inserted into this atlas, because this inevitably repeats the materials of the world geography atlas.

The provincial maps at the back, except for the nine northeastern provinces and the two provinces of Suiyuan and Ningxia, which are combined into one map due to the intricate regions, the rest are one province per map. Although the scale of each map cannot be unified, which affects the reader's sense of area size, this configuration method is indeed more in line with reality in today's China, where the concept of provincial divisions is very strong. The maps of each province are very detailed. The main and branch lines of the highway are indicated by thick and thin lines, and the reader can see the difference in importance at a glance. It is just that there are too many place names listed on each map. The maps of provinces such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Yunnan, Hebei, and Shandong are densely occupied by place names, and it is very laborious for the person reading the map. Because this atlas is a textbook map, most of the names cannot be mentioned, and if unimportant place names are written less, the map will be simpler and the reader's perception will be clearer. The editors must have been afraid that everyone would not be able to find the place names, so they inadvertently sought details instead of simplicity. We can infer this good intention.

The explanations in this atlas are extremely concise, and no nonsense can be found in them. In the explanations of the general map section, it is best to explain in detail the topographic overview, climatic characteristics, population distribution, industrial situation, and urban formation.

The above-mentioned opinions, whether right or wrong, our main purpose is to arouse discussion among the editorial authorities and interested people.

### "Introduction to Literary Theory"

— Huran

Written by Cai Yi, published by Cultural Life Publishing House

The book "Introduction to Literature" includes several questions on the nature of literature, namely: (1) What is literature? (2) Why is literature? (3) How does literature arise and develop? In this booklet, the author has made in-depth analyses and explanations of these three questions. We will now briefly describe his central ideas below to provide readers who love literature with a reference:

(1) What is literature? Literature is what gives us impressions of things, arouses our emotions, and can increase our knowledge—that is to say: when we are reading a novel, the characters described in the book, their appearance, attitude, words, and actions, always appear in our minds. When he falls into some unfortunate encounter, you are angry and sad for him; when he is struggling, you will be excited and worried for him; and it is the background depicted in the novel that allows us to clearly recognize how dark and complex the circle we live in is; we should have what kind of vigilance in our after-reading meditation.

Literature is to describe the things of the objective real world, the people and events of society, and never to narrate the empty theory of images; it not only tells us about the birds, beasts, grass, and trees of natural things, but also allows us to have a knowledge of things, because we can understand the social and historical movement of the production of a certain thing; a novel may express much historical knowledge that many history books cannot express in detail, and a short poem can express great truths that a long paper cannot express—literature can increase our knowledge, so that we can obtain a holistic understanding of the environment in which the thing itself exists.

(2) Why is literature? Literary works are not exclusively a tool to publicize an idea or promote a lesson; nor are they a form of entertainment for people to pass the time; strictly speaking, they are a tool to organize society; if a person wants to live with other people, they must have a way to transmit and receive thoughts and emotions, so that human beings can help each other and contact each other to live a social life; literary works are this best medium of transmission; because they can express things more concretely and completely, and at the same time their readership is also larger; they not only reflect objective things, but also show the development of society; therefore, a true literary worker, the social consciousness he expresses, must be forward-looking, correct, and full of revolutionary spirit.

(3) How does literature arise and develop? Literature is a relatively refined product, a crystallization of human evolution to a considerable stage; its occurrence and development are determined by the social foundation. The origin of literature is not only due to the development of human religious emotions, but also due to labor; the sound of "Hang Yu" from the mouths of coolies is thought by some to be the origin of literature; the songs of savage peoples in the hunting era are the prototype of poetry; so we list poetry as the earliest literature; at that time, poetry was inseparable from music and dance; after narrative poetry and lyric poetry were differentiated; narrative poetry that could be sung and performed by two or more people was the beginning of opera; and narrative poetry sung by one person was the beginning of ballad singing; when opera reached the eve of capitalism, it developed into spoken drama, and ballad singing and the like developed into modern novels; this is the general situation of the occurrence and development of the various forms of literature today.

Literature follows the development of social history; it can be divided into the following four classes:

(1) Literature of slave society—the literary content of this era, in addition to being related to religion, partly reflects the life of slave owners, and very little reflects the life of slaves. The content is dominated by praising the compassion of gods; and pays attention to form, so "poetry" became the best form at that time. Those theoretical articles that cannot be expressed in poetry use the form of fu, and the sentences of Lao Tzu's I Ching are rhyming—this is the characteristic of the literature at that time. (2) Literature of feudal society—at the end of slave society, the personality and creativity of free people could be brought into play, so from the Han to the Sui Dynasties, my country's literary achievements were remarkable (at this time, Western Europe was in a period of literary decline), and the poems and lyrics of the Tang and Song Dynasties had developed to the most brilliant stage, but most of those authors were from the ruling class, so they only sympathized with the oppressed serfs. After the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, novels and plays gradually developed, their expression was relatively strong, and they were easily welcomed by readers, and the content often exposed the incompetence and crimes of feudal landlords, "Dream of the Red Chamber", "Water Margin", "Officialdom Exposed" and so on, are real examples. (3) Social literature of capitalism—after the rise of capitalism, human beings struggled to break free from old shackles and sought the development of personality. They took equality and freedom as their central ideas, so the achievements in literature were relatively outstanding. The purpose of the New Literature Movement was precisely to oppose all feudal shackles. (4) Literature of the new century—the century of the people, needs freedom in politics and economy. At this time, the people's artistic requirements have been reflected in literature, becoming the people's literature; and it is also slightly different in nature from the past; first, it is the people who are the protagonists, second, it is to grasp objective things from the people's point of view; third, it is to express it in the language of the people; Gorky and other great writers' creations have these factors; therefore, the future of literature is not only related to the efforts of literary writers, but also matches the growth of people's power and the progress of society.

"Introduction to Literary Theory" is a purely theoretical small book. The author allows us to understand some of the main points of the essence of literature in a very short time in the simplest way. We now use a small number of words to introduce the main ideas, just to hope that readers can have a more kind of understanding of several basic questions about literature.

In addition to being clear in explaining the theory, this book has no other obvious features. At the same time, the author did not list the bibliography at the end of the book, which is very inconvenient for readers who want to delve into this issue.

### The Laboring Society – Written for May First Labor Day

— Ge Yi

Our society, all of its civilization and education, is the product of human labor. Whether it be mental or physical labor, our goal is to acquire more living resources for humanity and to seek more joy and happiness. In the past, during primitive times, human labor advanced toward this goal, and in the present atomic age, human labor is still the same, and it will not change in the future.

Logically, with society having evolved to the 20th century, and with the fruits accumulated from our human labor, today we should all certainly have enough happiness in life, and at the very least, there should definitely not be anyone suffering from hunger or cold. However, in reality, we know that most of the people today are living difficult lives under the torment of survival, and countless people die young due to the lack of food and clothing.

Clearly, although human society has evolved, an unreasonable social system that devalues people has also emerged along with it. Let us not mention anything else; why is it that some people exhaust their mental and physical strength to labor, but in the end, there is nowhere for them to use it? Why is it that the income of laborers cannot even support themselves and their children? On the contrary, those who do not labor can enjoy a comfortable life, even extending to their sons and relatives? It is also very obvious that these people are plundering the fruits of the laborers. Laborers have completely become the private property of capitalists—like cattle, horses, or machines.

However, although our society has unfortunately experienced the so-called era of capitalism, people have eventually realized that this system is a shackle on human progress, a wretched fate of slavery. After the wheels of time have rolled over that difficult track, no one is willing to return to that painful path. Now, even though our future is still rough, the torch of democracy has already illuminated our eyes.

Everyone should have reasonable work, this work is for oneself and for society; all those who labor should have adequate living resources, whatever they need, they should have. The work of society is divided, but division of labor does not mean creating human classes; in creating a more civilized life, everyone is a hero. Moreover, mental labor and physical labor are integrated with each other.

Everyone has books to read, jobs to do, and all the sustenance and needs. We must strive towards this direction, and the meaning of today's Labor Day lies here.

### Chinese Studies

— Meng Ping

A question in the test published in the Ta Kung Pao regarding whether Japan will invade China has caused me to feel quite melancholy after reading it.

Before surrendering, Japan had specialized organizations studying China, such as the South Manchuria Railway Research Department, the East Asia Economic Research Bureau, and the East Asia Research Institute. These organizations were dissolved and eliminated following Japan's surrender; however, many newly emerging organizations have been established to conduct comprehensive investigations and research on Chinese issues, such as the "China Research Institute" established in January last year, which has as many as eighty-eight scholars and experts familiar with the Chinese situation.

Currently, there are various publications on Chinese studies, such as *Chinese Literature* (Shenghuo Publishing House), *New China* (Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha), *Chinese Review* (edited by the China Research Institute and published by Nihon Hyoron Sha), *Monthly China* (Kodo Sha), and *New China* (Teikoku Shoin). On the other hand, how many specialized publications do we have studying Japan? It can be said that, apart from sporadic articles published in newspapers, there are almost none.

Needless to say, their purpose in studying China is to grasp the reality of modern China, study China's international relations, and critique Japan's past policies towards China in order to establish a new relationship between China and Japan. (The above is part of the business outline of the China Research Institute.) They feel that the Chinese problem has a great impact on them, directly and indirectly. In reality, Japan's every move has an even greater impact on us.

Their style is still to create a "Japanese industrial nation," and with MacArthur's support, they are gradually moving towards this path. But what about us? We are still in turmoil, and "Japanese studies" is even more out of the question.

### A She-Devil, Not a Demon

— Qi Lou

I saw the news about the she-devil in the newspaper and saw her picture. This "demon" neither has three heads and six arms, nor a blue face and fangs, and doesn't look monstrous at all: she looks like what Shanghai people call a mistress from a "white collar" family, without any demonic aura.

Looking at her behavior; first, she dresses as a man. Dressing as a man doesn't necessarily make one a demon. What kind of clothes should a woman wear anyway? You can't say, and I can't say either. Ancient Han Chinese clothing? Western women's attire? Or a fire-colored coat, a short jacket on top, long trousers on the bottom, and a Manchu qipao in the middle?

Second, she seduces good women. If this also counts as something only demons do, then there are too many she-devils in our society. The tools for seducing good women vary, among which the most important are money, power, status, beauty, intelligence, eloquence, and so on. This woman only used a set of men's clothing, without any magic involved.

Third, she commits indecent acts against the seduced women. Speaking of this, we can't help but think of many gentlemen and ladies, celebrities and socialites in society, it's better not to talk about it. In short, this woman and these people are not enough to be considered demons.

Fourth, she induces addiction to smoking, which has even less to do with demons. Fifth, she instigates discord between husbands and wives. There are many divorces in this era, and it is not said that there are demons causing trouble in them.

Sixth, she defrauds people of money. If this old woman did not defraud people of money but only engaged in the first five things, then although she is not a demon, she must be called a freak. Now, just as the Western saying goes, all roads lead to Rome, she is no different from you, me, and him, busy and bustling, all for the sake of profit. What demon is there in this? What freak is there in this? It is truly too mundane, too much like the so-called "popularization."

Since the she-devil is not a demon, the story about the she-devil has a bit of a demonic air. The news report said that among the victims of the she-devil are many concubines, and one of them is said to be the concubine of a certain wealthy merchant. The wealthy merchant and the concubine are naturally not demons either, but there is always something strange about their relationship. It is from this strangeness that the story of the she-devil arises.

### The Tragedy of the "Counter Lions"

— Li Quan

I have been involved in labor movement activities for less than a year. I have become aware of many obstacles to the labor movement, which have given me the impression of being thorny and distressing, empty and sad. What is discussed here is the labor movement of old-fashioned shops, not involving the scope of industrial workers.

Logically, in this democratic era, all actions and words of the people that are in accordance with the proper path should not be subject to any restrictions. Moreover, labor movement organizations are a link in the national "use of the people" organization, and should of course be fully guaranteed. However, because this is the beginning of democracy, and all laws related to the labor movement have not yet undergone a complete transformation; therefore, those engaged in the labor movement still feel endless distress at any time; the workers' hearts are also still filled with endless sadness.

Look, this is the common situation of shop workers, working sixteen hours a day, getting up at six in the morning and not going to bed until after ten at night; they are like birds closed in a cage, silently doing shop duties in the store all day long, not getting any right to entertainment, especially under the apprenticeship system, constantly destroying lively children. Low wages, hard life, serving like this until death, I don't know how much resentment is buried underground, but they have never received sympathy from the outside world. How pitiful are this group of people called "counter lions"? Can they still engage in labor movement activities? Can they still enjoy labor movement rights?

If someone is elected as a director or supervisor of the labor union, then he must be sensible and manage less labor union affairs; otherwise, his job will be in trouble. Although, the dismissal of a labor union director or supervisor by the capital side in the serving store must be submitted to the authorities for approval, but where there is a desire to condemn, there is no lack of excuses—paying him a few months of dismissal salary, what else can be said?

A labor union clerk who runs out to solicit members can see everywhere; it is the old man or manager with a sullen face, squinting his eyes, glaring at the employees; this situation, even in the hot weather in June, will make people feel chills. Of course, he can also make the employees remain silent, not daring to join the labor union. Therefore, most of the employees hope that the labor union can forcibly make them join the union. But who has ever heard of using the current "People's Organizations Compulsory Membership Measures"? This is not the laziness of the labor union clerk, it is that the "measures" cannot be applied to reality! (Above)

### Not Murder

— Hua

Man A: I want to shoot and kill the person who married my wife.

Man B: You can't do that, that's committing murder, isn't it?

Man A: No, it's just suicide.

### American Car Stores

— Ying Dong

Every Sunday morning, the streets of American towns are filled with the sound of horns. White trucks crawl on the roads, stopping every fifty or sixty yards. Most of them are children and women, loaded with groceries, vegetables, and household goods. These newly designed stores are mostly converted from wartime vehicles, driven by veterans. They put grocery stores on cars, symbolizing the vitality of American small businesses.

### Literary and Art Circles

Our Hong Kong-based reporter Lin Youlan, after translating "The Bell of Adano," recently submitted the translation of the new book "Arch of Triumph" by the famous German writer Remarque to "Banana Publishing House" for publication. The book has been shipped to this city for sale. Banana Publishing House is the only publishing center in South China composed of cultural figures who returned from the rear areas of Yu and Kun after the war, and there are currently many new books in the process of being printed.

The novelist Ai Wu is still living in the Chongqing orphanage. He recently wrote to a friend in Shanghai saying: "Four children are all suffering from measles, writing has been suspended for nearly a month." (Jing Cheng)

SY (Liu Shengya) is currently engaged in translating Soviet novels. Some of them are old Russian novels that have not yet been translated by Chinese people. Mr. Liu is currently translating from German texts. (Jing Cheng)

Mao Dun brought back a large number of paintings and photographs from the Soviet Union. There are also many Soviet publications. In addition, he brought back many Soviet chocolate candies, which taste very good. (Jiu)

Many writers and editors went to Hangzhou for sightseeing this spring, but the Hangzhou plan of the Literary and Art Association has been cancelled, reportedly because too few people participated. (Qing)

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

"However, she is already Mrs. Hu!" someone objected.

"What does marriage matter?" Xiao Zhang immediately retorted. "Didn't you see her helping us rush to paint the scenery a few days ago?"

"I think that Fei Fei is also very cute!" Lu Qian also joined their conversation. "Yesterday, she went out with us to perform 'Put Down Your Whip,' and many people were moved to tears. It's a pity that the problem of them leaving has not been resolved until now. Alas! This world is fundamentally unreasonable!"

In fact, the evacuation problem of Lan and Fei Fei has other twists and turns, not simply because there is no car. Dai Shaoming recently received a telegram from Hu Juewen from Chongqing, asking him to be sure to find a way to bring his wife and children back, and promising to pay for the travel expenses; while Old Xu's wife had another idea, because she is a woman who loves vanity and loves to show off the most, using humiliating others and exalting herself as a kind of life pleasure. She is very jealous of Guan's rich knowledge—of course, she will never admire her beauty—and hates her upright and unyielding personality that does not easily bow her head to others. She has even seen through some of the past friendship between Lan and Zhu Zhaonian; thus, a strong desire arose in her heart to take advantage of their current environment where they have to ask Xu Fatty for help, to forcibly subdue this knowledgeable and ambitious enemy, so that she can vent her commanding habits more happily, and in the future, she can say to acquaintances with a dismissive expression:

"Mrs. Hu? What's she! She wouldn't dare to speak to me!"

Therefore, she instead encouraged Xu Shaoming to take their mother and daughter away.

However, Lan, who loves art, also has a smarter mind than that Mrs. Ni. She had already seen through the personalities of Xu Shaoming and his wife. In any case, she did not want to let herself and her beloved daughter fall into their trap, to be controlled by them, to be bullied by them. She declined their invitation very happily, preferring to find other ways. Zhu Zhaonian also respected her wishes. From the day Xiao Rong left with Jin Ai, he moved out of the small school dormitory in Dongting and lived with Lu Qian and Zhang Chang in the art museum, so as not to be slanderously criticized by the eloquent Mrs. Xu. (59)
