### Common Policy Guidelines of the Three Parties Officially Announced by the National Government Today; List of Government Commissioners to Be Announced Followed by Assumption of Office

[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] The date for the announcement of the common policy guidelines of the three parties has not yet been finalized as of tonight. Wu Dingchang, the Chief Secretary, advocates for the announcement to be made by the National Government on April 18th, as that day marks the 20th anniversary of the National Government's establishment in Nanjing. He believes it would be more meaningful if the policy guidelines and the list of government commissioners were announced on that day. However, the final decision awaits the President's review.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] The common policy guidelines have been finalized. The previously reported twelve articles remain largely unchanged. However, a preamble has been added to the articles decided upon during the meeting at Sun Ke's residence at 5 PM on the 15th. The general idea is as follows: In order to implement constitutional government and promote democracy, the National Government has been seeking to invite individuals from various parties and social elites to jointly participate in the government since the Political Consultative Conference. After continuous efforts, an agreement has been reached with representatives from various parties regarding the policy guidelines of the reorganized government, which has been approved by the Central Standing Committees of the three parties and is now ready for implementation. The contents of the twelve articles are hereby announced as follows: (Note: The original twelve articles are largely consistent with what this newspaper published last month. The main points are summarized as follows:) (1) The reorganized National Government will continue to use the Principles of Peaceful National Reconstruction as its policy guideline, with various parties and social elites jointly responsible. (2) The principles of political democratization and the nationalization of the military will serve as the foundation for cooperation among various parties. Under this joint cooperation, political progress and national stability will be pursued. (3) If the Chinese Communist Party is willing to pursue peace, the government will seek domestic peace through political means after railway transportation is restored. (4) Provincial and municipal councils should make every effort to involve members of various parties, and provincial and municipal governments should also make every effort to involve members of various parties. Furthermore, the revised Article 11 is as follows: "All foreign debts incurred in the future shall be specifically designated for stabilizing and improving people's livelihoods and for production and construction."

[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] A meeting was held at Sun Ke's residence at 5:30 PM on the 15th to finalize the common policy guidelines. Government representatives present included Chen Bulei, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Qun, Wang Shijie, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, Shao Lizi, and Sun Ke; representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party included Zhang Junmai and Jiang Yuntian; and representatives from the Youth Party included Chen Qitian and Zuo Shunsheng. After making slight revisions to the content, it was decided that each party would prepare a copy and exchange them via mail on the 16th. The Kuomintang will hold a Central Standing Committee meeting on the morning of the 16th to approve the guidelines. Afterwards, the Chairman will convene representatives from various parties and social elites for a final review, which will also serve as a signing ceremony. The lists of government commissioners from the three parties and social elites will be submitted at the same time. After the National Government announces the lists, the new government commissioners will be sworn in and form the new government. The first session of the National Government Committee will be convened on the same day to discuss the reorganization of the Executive Yuan.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] The candidates for government commissioners from social elites are as follows: Mo Dehui, Hu Shi, Zhang Shizhao, and Wang Yunwu. However, if Hu Shi firmly declines the position, or if Wang Yunwu continues to hold a ministerial position in the Executive Yuan, Chen Guangfu will succeed him. The above five individuals have been agreed upon by all parties. It has also been decided that there will be five political affairs committee members, with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party each nominating two members. The social elite representative is Miao Yuntai.

[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] Jiang Yuntian recently told reporters that the list of candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party for the Government Committee has been largely finalized. Wu Xianzi initially requested to resign due to illness, but it has now been agreed upon, and he is expected to arrive in Nanjing in about two weeks. The remaining members are Ji Yiqiao, Xu Shiying, and Hu Haimen, making a total of four. Furthermore, the political affairs committee members from the Democratic Socialist Party are He Daming and Jiang Yuntian.

### Legislative Yuan Passes Resolutions in Plenary Session; Recovery of Government Shares in the "Little Four" Banks; Draft Banking Law to Be Further Discussed Today

[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] The Legislative Yuan held its 321st regular session at 9:30 AM on the 15th, chaired by President Sun. The session discussed various proposals, mostly related to economic affairs, including the recovery of government shares in the "Little Four" Banks and the organizational regulations of the National Economic Commission. Regarding the four banks—China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, China Industrial Bank, National Goods Bank, and Siming Bank—these were not originally national banks. Prior to the War of Resistance, due to a run on the banks, the government, in order to stabilize the financial situation, invested over ten million in government shares (wartime legal tender), accounting for about 80% of the total shares of the "Little Four" Banks. However, over the years, these banks have largely failed to remit government dividends and earnings to the national treasury. The Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan previously resolved at the 40th joint session of the Fourth Session that the government shares in these banks should be recovered based on the net value of each bank's assets minus liabilities. When the proposal was presented at the regular session on the 15th, while some committee members such as Sun Jiulu advocated for conditional recovery, the majority voted in favor of immediate recovery in order to delineate public and private boundaries and establish a national banking system. Zhang Zhaoyuan traced the history of government investment in the "Little Four" Banks and analyzed the proportion of government shares, noting that the government's initial investment of over ten million would be worth over a hundred billion at current currency values, while the government's annual revenue is only 6.5 million, just reaching pre-war levels, with the profits being pocketed by those in charge, causing a great loss to the nation. Wei Tingsheng also believed that from a financial perspective, the government's investment was not worthwhile and that it would be better to sell the shares to make up for the national budget deficit rather than allow a few people to profit. Li Qingchen did not advocate for the recovery of government shares but suggested that the government purchase the relatively small number of commercial shares, turning the "Little Four" Banks into national banks. In the final vote, with over eighty members present, seventy-two voted in favor, passing the resolution that the government shares in the "Little Four" Banks should be recovered based on net value, with the specific procedures to be drafted by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with relevant agencies. The session then discussed the proposal by Committee Member Mei Shuzeng and thirty-eight others to sell the government shares withdrawn from the "Little Four" Banks at a publicly assessed value based on the total existing assets. The proposed method was to have the process overseen by supervisory agencies and to distribute the shares proportionally between government and commercial interests for public sale, with the names of the purchasers disclosed. Personnel handling the case and managing the "Little Four" Banks would be prohibited from purchasing the shares to avoid suspicion. During the discussion, many legislators believed that the implementation would involve too many complications and would not be easy to handle. It was resolved to pass the principle and send it to the government for adoption and implementation, along with the previous case. Another important item on the agenda was the organizational regulations of the National Economic Commission. After Economic Committee Chairman Lou Tongsun explained the review process, Committee Members Jian Guansan and others immediately stood up to oppose the proposal, arguing that this redundant agency was unnecessary, as the National Economic Commission would have too many members and excessively broad powers, without any participation from people's representatives. Since there was already an Executive Yuan Council, there seemed to be no need to establish another agency. Zhong Tianxin and others believed that under the current economic conditions, the establishment of this agency was necessary and that its powers would not necessarily overlap with those of the Executive Yuan Council. Lou Tongsun pointed out that the National Economic Commission would be an "economic advisory body" focused on research and coordination of economic affairs, and that it would be better to have such an agency than not to have one. It was resolved to refer the matter to the Finance, Economic, and Legal Committees for further review of the content. The session adjourned at around 3 PM. Because important matters such as the draft Banking Law and the detailed rules for the election and recall of National Assembly delegates were still pending discussion, it was resolved to hold the 322nd regular session on the 17th to continue the deliberations.

### Increase Education Funding; Establish More Vocational Schools

[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 15th, after the reporting items, the following were discussed: (1) The Finance Committee, together with the Criminal Law Committee, reported on the review of the draft amendment to the Mining Law, and it was resolved to pass it. (2) The Finance Committee, together with the Economic Committee, reported on the re-examination and amendment of the draft Provincial Bank Regulations, and it was decided to approve it with minor amendments. (3) The Finance Committee, together with the Legal System Committee, reported on the review of the proposal by Committee Member Chen Anren and others, suggesting that the government increase education funding, establish more vocational schools to accommodate high school graduates who cannot enter universities, and establish more vocational schools to accommodate junior high school graduates who cannot continue their studies. It was resolved to approve the proposal based on the review opinions and send a letter to the competent authorities requesting them to pay attention to establishing more vocational schools within the possible scope when compiling the budget for the next fiscal year. High school graduates who have served in the military should be assigned to universities or preparatory classes according to their academic level, and those who have already entered universities should be given preferential treatment. Provincial governments should also be instructed to establish more vocational schools. (4) The Civil Law Committee, together with the Legal System Committee and the Economic Committee, reported on the review of the case regarding the repatriation of real estate mortgaged by overseas Chinese, and it was resolved to approve it based on the review opinions. According to the review opinions, the provisions of Articles 7 and 12 of the Supplementary Regulations on Civil Litigation After Restoration are sufficient to address the issue of the redemption period and the requirement to redeem at the original price, so it does not seem necessary to formulate separate measures. (5) The Finance Committee, together with the Economic Committee, reported on the re-examination of the proposal to have the government recover the government shares in China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, China Industrial Bank, National Goods Bank, and Siming Bank based on net value, and it was resolved to approve it based on the review opinions. The recovery of government shares will be handled by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with relevant agencies. (6) Committee Member Mei Shuzeng and others proposed that the government shares withdrawn from the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, China Industrial Bank, National Goods Bank, and Siming Bank should be sold at a publicly assessed value based on the total existing assets, and it was resolved to approve the principle and send it to the government for adoption and implementation together with the previous case. (7) The Criminal Law Committee, together with the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee, reported on the drafting of the Regulations on Penalties for Trading in Gold and Foreign Exchange, and it was approved with amendments. (8) The Economic Committee, together with the Legal System Committee, reported on the review of the draft organizational regulations of the National Economic Commission, and it was resolved to refer it back to the Economic, Finance, and Legal System Committees for further study and review of the content. (9) The Criminal Law Committee, together with the Legal System Committee, reported on the supplementary regulations for the disposal of property of traitors who die before trial, and it was resolved to amend Article 8 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors. (10) The Criminal Law Committee reported on the amendment of Article 16 of the Regulations on the Suppression of Opium and Narcotics.

### Yang Liangong Returns to Nanjing; Reports on the Inspection of the Taiwan Incident

### He Hanwen Claims in Interrogation That China and Taiwan Are Inseparable

[Report from Our Nanjing Office on the 15th] He Hanwen, the supervisor who recently returned from an investigation in Taiwan, told our reporter on the 15th that the situation in Taiwan has become stable, and he sincerely hopes that after the reorganization of the Taiwan Province, it can be on equal footing with other provinces of the country and embark on the path of democracy. He particularly emphasized that China cannot be separated from Taiwan, and Taiwan cannot be separated from China. He frequently mentioned the important position that Taiwan occupies in China's future construction and believes that "suppression should come before leniency, and leniency should be applied to suppression." He declined to make any announcements regarding the suppression part. In his report, he made several suggestions on the points that should be paid attention to in future administration. He believes that the main causes of this incident are: (1) The Japanese ruled Taiwan for more than fifty years, and what they usually promoted was the idea of ​​disdaining China. In addition, the authorities' facilities after the recovery of the island were not completely ideal, and the Taiwanese people changed from hope to disappointment, and finally caused a big wave of opposition. (2) The Japanese left some evil forces in Taiwan. (3) Too many mainlanders were employed by the Chief Executive's Office, which inevitably led to corruption, and Taiwanese people rarely had a chance to set foot in various agencies. (4) The public office and the monopoly system made it difficult for small and large businesses to survive. Mr. He believes he will assume the new position of Taiwan Supervisor. It is said that the new Supervisory Yuan Organizational Law has abolished the Supervisory Office system, so the Supervisory Office may not be set up again there. When asked by the reporter whether Chen Yi would come to Nanjing recently, Mr. He did not give a definite answer.

### Dalian's Takeover Still Pending; China and the Soviet Union Have Different Opinions on Fortification

[Report from Our Beiping Office on the 15th] The Dalian issue will be difficult to resolve in the short term. The key is: (1) The Soviet Union believes that it must still be able to station troops in Dalian before the conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. (2) Regarding the fortification of Lushun, the Soviet Union believes that it should be handled separately. China advocates that both parties should build fortifications separately.

Personnel receiving Dalian are still arriving north one after another.

For the position of mayor of Lushun, Xiong Shihui intends to appoint Sun Guiji and is soliciting opinions from all parties.

### National Federation of Banking Associations Established: Chairman Chiang Sends Congratulatory Telegram, Hoping to Gather Collective Wisdom to Achieve National Reconstruction

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] The National Federation of Banking Associations (全國銀錢業同公會聯合會) held its inaugural meeting at the Lizhi Society (勵志社) in Nanjing on the 15th. The venue was simply and solemnly decorated. Guests included Wu Dingchang, Chief of Staff of the National Government; Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance; Xu Kan, Director of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics; and Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank. Eighty-one representatives attended, including Du Yuesheng, Li Fuxun, Xu Jiyin, Liu Hangchen, and Hu Zi'ang. The ceremony was grand. After the formalities, Li Fuxun, the director of the preparatory committee and chairman of the meeting, delivered the opening speech, stating: The organization of the Banking Federation did not start today. It was established as early as the 9th year of the Republic (1920), but was suspended in the 13th year (1924). Now it is being re-established. Banks in our country have a history of more than 50 years, but none have been able to gather the industry nationwide in one place as it does today. In the recent ten years, science and technology in various parts of the world have become more and more prosperous. Both economy and culture need cooperation and mutual assistance. Therefore, the organization of a national institution such as this Federation is urgent. In the future, we must make our best efforts in serving the society and developing our business.

Next, Secretary-General Li Ganzai reported on the preparatory process, and Chief of Staff Wu read President Chiang's congratulatory telegram. Leaders of various agencies who delivered training speeches included Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization; Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance; Pan Xulun, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs; Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank; Shen Yi, Mayor of Nanjing; and Wang Xiaolai, Shanghai representative. Finally, member representative Hu Zi'ang delivered a reply speech, and the meeting adjourned.

The original text of Chairman Chiang's telegram is as follows: To the National Federation of Banking Associations: The rise and fall of the financial industry is closely related to the prosperity and decline of the national economy and the people's livelihood. This has become a established rule in both China and foreign countries. During the War of Resistance, the financial community in our country was able to unite and overcome difficulties, achieving the merits of stabilizing the precarious situation and supporting the War of Resistance. Looking back on the enthusiasm and perseverance of the past eight years, there is much to commend. Since the victory and recovery, in addition to the devastation caused by the enemy, and the decline of production, we still rely on the consistent sincerity of the national financial community to strive towards economic recovery. Although the difficulties and setbacks are even greater than during the war, we were still able to assist the government in implementing laws and regulations. Recently, the promulgation of the Economic Emergency Measures Program and the issuance of treasury bonds and public bonds have been smoothly implemented, which is also due to the financial community's understanding of national policies and diligent implementation. Now that the General Assembly is held in Nanjing, gathering representatives from all over the country, and with good intentions and wise plans to help achieve national reconstruction, there will surely be profound thoughts and intentions. In the future, what is hoped is how the financial community should work together to gradually achieve a balance in the national budget, establish a solid foundation for currency reform, so as to stabilize the people's livelihood, increase production, and promote construction. I hope that you can express your excellent insights and gather collective wisdom to accomplish the mission that the financial community should bear for national reconstruction. Chiang Chung-cheng (蒋中正 印).

Chen Lifu: Hopes for Three Points

Chen Lifu's speech briefly stated: The establishment of the General Assembly is of great significance. We place great hopes on it: (1) Strengthen the organization so that it can generate the function of responding to the top and bottom, and can cooperate with the implementation of national policies; (2) Study financial issues so that the country can embark on the path of construction, establish financial institutions everywhere, and complete the financial framework; (3) Banking business should move towards developing agriculture and industry.

Yu Hongjun: Hopes to Create a New Atmosphere

Yu Hongjun's speech briefly stated: The national organization of the banking industry is a pioneering undertaking, and its significance is significant. The history of banking in our country is less than 60 years, but it has achieved today's results, which is really the result of everyone's efforts. At present, according to the branches of banks approved by the Ministry of Finance, there are already more than 1,200 units. In the past, it made great contributions to supporting the War of Resistance. The progress and stability of banking business are symbols of the progress and stability of social economy. In the future, our goal is how to create a good atmosphere in the banking industry. First, we must encourage, persuade, and supervise each other among colleagues. We especially hope that the Association can take its responsibility. I hope that the banking industry can open up a new path in the future and add a new force to the country's economic construction.

Zhang Jia'ao: Describes Central Bank's Policies

Zhang Jia'ao's speech briefly stated: I am very happy to come and participate in the capacity of a colleague. China's economy, from before the war to the present, can be said to have gone through three turning points and three glorious records: that is, the gradual success of China's yarn factories and flour factories, which enabled domestic products to develop, this was the first era; the second was from the 16th year of the Republic (1927) to before the 24th year (1935), during which the deposits of domestic banks in China far exceeded those of foreign domestic banks; the third was today's economy after eight years of the War of Resistance, which is still gradually recovering. Although there are some difficulties at present, we are all confident that we can overcome them. Then Zhang declared three points of the Central Bank's business policy in the future: (1) Restore the standard of commercial ethics; (2) Integrate the interests of banks with the interests of the country and the interests of all the people; (3) We should focus on the domestic economy and restore the countryside.

Hu Zi'ang

Hu Zi'ang delivered a reply speech, putting forward four points: First, financial policy should not be biased towards how to control, but should lead to the path of production and construction; second, the financial industry and financiers hope to have a common banking law to follow, determine economic policies, and stabilize the financial market, so that the financial industry can meet the needs of national construction; third, the business of the financial industry itself should exist rationally within a legitimate scope in order to cooperate with the national economic policy; fourth, eliminate common misconceptions and do not think that the chaos in the financial market is a disturbance by financiers. The financial industry should closely cooperate with economic policy.

### Jurisdiction Level of Appeals for Enemy and Puppet Property Cases

Executive Yuan Decides to Issue Orders for Compliance

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 15th] Since the enemy and puppet property handling agencies in various places have undergone many changes, the Executive Yuan has made the following decisions regarding the jurisdiction level of appeals for enemy and puppet property cases and issued orders for compliance: (1) For enemy and puppet property handling bureaus that still exist (Hebei, Tianjin-Beijing area, and Qingdao area of Shandong), the original plan will still be followed. (2) For areas where the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee and the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office coexist (Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area and Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian area), those who disagree with the decisions of the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee will still appeal to the Executive Yuan according to the original plan. As for those who disagree with the decisions of the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office, they can only request the competent Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee to review the case through the usual litigation method, because the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office is only a business organization and not a government agency as defined by the Appeals Law, and no appeal can be filed against its decisions. (3) For areas where only the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office is established (Wuhan area), those who disagree with the decisions of the Central Trust Bureau's Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office should request the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee to review the case through the usual petition method. (4) For areas where only the Office of the Special Commissioner for Handling and Receiving Enemy and Puppet Property is established (Henan area), those who disagree with the decisions of the Office of the Special Commissioner for Handling and Receiving Enemy and Puppet Property will appeal to the Executive Yuan.

Commentary

### The Prerequisite Issues of Overseas Chinese Affairs

The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission was established on April 16th, 1932, and this year marks its 15th anniversary. Since the establishment of overseas Chinese affairs agencies in the ninth year of Xianfeng's reign during the late Qing Dynasty, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has undergone nine changes, experiencing a sea of changes.

The commission was born on the eve of an unprecedented storm, when the country was in great distress. The flower of overseas Chinese affairs blossomed dimly, without brilliance. Later, the external threats, painfully experienced layer by layer, approached step by step. An unprecedented storm blew for eight years, and heavy rain poured for eight years, blowing the flower of overseas Chinese affairs to pieces. After eight years of hardship upon hardship, the leaders led their colleagues to tenaciously guard their posts, relying on a few bowls of thin gruel and a few thatched huts, enduring worries and dangers. When the enemy surrendered and victory came, everyone thought that after the rain the sky would clear and overseas Chinese affairs would bear some fruit. Who would have thought that storm after storm would follow, and the fruit of overseas Chinese affairs would never grow big? There were few people in charge and many critics, and everyone couldn't help but feel resentment and depression. However, how much help can emotions really give to facts? Everyone could only endure, endure the endurance needed in the revolutionary process, enduring and waiting for next year, the year after, and the year after that... In days like stagnant water, in circumstances like mold and rot, we passed day by day. This is how the 15-year history of overseas Chinese affairs was made. This is a history of hardship and also a history of steadfastness.

There is no country in the world with as many overseas Chinese as China, with as many as 12 million. There is also no country in the world where overseas Chinese suffer so much, to the point of being precarious. The large group of overseas Chinese scattered in 64 countries toil day and night, cultivating the land, doing manual labor, and working as tenant farmers, while others reap the harvest, become big merchants, become landlords, and fatten themselves to live in big houses, drive big cars, and enjoy themselves. Our overseas Chinese live in bad houses and eat bad food, and still have to be told that overseas Chinese are uncivilized. They scold when they want to scold, hit when they want to hit, slaughter when they want to harm, and massacre when they want to massacre. What a picture of quasi-colonial overseas Chinese!

After an epoch-making war, humans who have heard the sound of atomic bombs still harbor malicious thoughts. During the war, overseas Chinese suffered the enemy's cruelty, and the crystallization of their blood and sweat was completely destroyed. Wronged ghosts filled the wilderness, and the sea of blood was stained everywhere. After the war, still in shock, they suffered again as innocent bystanders, facing the threat of the death penalty. The rulers went all the way to the end, and the ruled went all the way to revolution. We overseas orphans, caught between two extremes, have become the unfortunate children of victory! The disasters of overseas Chinese are our pain, and they are also a major issue for overseas Chinese affairs today. Looking to the future, the prospects for overseas Chinese in colonial countries are bound to be bleak. Look at the bloodshed in Siam, the massacres in the Dutch East Indies, the burning and looting in Vietnam, and the anti-Chinese sentiment in the Philippines. Then listen to the voices of Malaysians opposing the granting of citizenship to foreign nationals. The arrogance of "exclusivity" has risen to the sky. In the past, the question for overseas Chinese was how to "manage themselves." In the future, the question for overseas Chinese will be how to "survive." Self-management is a matter of livelihood, and survival is a matter of existence. The self-management and survival of overseas Chinese are intertwined to form the problem of overseas Chinese affairs today.

The problem is getting more and more serious, but simply turning thoughts on the problem itself will not solve it, because the problem itself is not a problem, and the hundreds of millions of problems are caused by other problems as the main cause. The weakness of the country and the poverty of the people are really big problems. Therefore, relying solely on a weak overseas Chinese affairs agency that has no money, no power, and is ignored by others is, frankly speaking, of no help. But at present, the overseas Chinese affairs agency should do things other than the problem itself. This is the prerequisite problem of overseas Chinese affairs. Taking advantage of the 15th anniversary of the association, let's talk about some prerequisite events that the overseas Chinese affairs agency should do today.

1.  Awakening the awareness of overseas Chinese affairs: Awareness is attitude and behavior. What kind of awareness, there must be what kind of deeds. However, the awareness of overseas Chinese affairs among Chinese people seems to be too insufficient. In the future, schools should set up courses such as overseas Chinese affairs and the history and geography of Southeast Asia. The public opinion should greatly promote the importance of overseas Chinese affairs. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission should use more pens and tongues to widely report on overseas Chinese affairs. It is necessary to let every household understand overseas Chinese affairs and feel from the bottom of their hearts that overseas Chinese affairs are indispensable. Only when the awareness of overseas Chinese affairs is consistently increased from top to bottom, and the seeds of overseas Chinese affairs are planted in your heart, his heart, and everyone's heart, can overseas Chinese affairs be rescued from the perfunctory situation.

2.  Administrative cooperation: The government is an organic whole, and the functions and powers of the administrative agencies of each department must be clearly divided. All administrative matters must cooperate with each other. Europe and the United States practice the "position classification system," setting up officials according to events and managing affairs according to officials. Each event determines its boundaries, and each official abides by his powers. Exceeding official duties is "usurping the altar on behalf of the chef," and dereliction of official duties is even more "holding a position without contributing." The departments related to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission are the five ministries of internal affairs, foreign affairs, economy, education, and society. Except for overseas Chinese education, cultural undertakings, and social organizations that have been clearly defined, with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in charge of overseas affairs, there are still immigration, trade, relief, and condolences to be determined. I think it would be good to hold a meeting to discuss and decide. Once the decision is made, there is no need to compete for power, no need to shirk responsibility, no credit should be attributed to oneself, and no blame should be attributed to others. Overseas Chinese affairs are not a publicity business. Many things often cause misunderstandings among outsiders or irritate outsiders. Sometimes things are published first, and the person in charge feels resistance afterwards. This harms the country and harms the overseas Chinese. Everyone must recognize that all activities are for the sake of the country, and all benefits should be attributed to the country.

3.  Striving for the Centripetal Force of Overseas Chinese: It is the nature of overseas Chinese to love the country and love the government. They have an instinctive tendency, and they are especially protective of their motherland because they love and suffer from the oppression of foreigners. Their patriotism is even higher than that of the people in the country. Even if the motherland forgets them, they miss the motherland at all times, just like a one-sided love. When they see a small flag with a blue sky, white sun, and red earth, they entrust their pride and hope to that flag. Therefore, there is absolutely no question about the centripetal force of overseas Chinese towards their motherland. The problem is that the motherland itself has erected too many obstacles, forcing their centrifugal force to grow day by day. For example, the protection of overseas Chinese is weak. Often, after a tragedy occurs for a long time, the grass has grown on the graves of the dead, and then personnel are sent to express condolences or file protests. But how many overseas Chinese lives and property have been saved by condolences and protests? It seems that there is nothing else to do besides condolences and protests. Kowtowing diplomacy is really heartbreaking for overseas Chinese. The second problem is the restriction on the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in their places of residence. Mr. Liu Xinru said, "Countries such as the Netherlands, France, and England all restrict remittances from overseas Chinese, which cannot exceed ten pounds per month." Mr. Guo Xin, the representative of Malaya, said, "The local government restricts remittances from overseas Chinese, which cannot exceed forty-five yuan per month." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not negotiated to open these shackles that bind overseas Chinese. The third situation is the decline in the value of the national currency. The savings bonds and national salvation bonds purchased by overseas Chinese in the past, such as Australia, paid more than 150 pounds in Australian dollars to buy the national difference. If calculated by a thousand times, one pound in Australian dollars is equivalent to 10,000 yuan in national currency. In this situation, what is the loss for the overseas Chinese who have exhausted all their possessions to purchase bonds of various periods?

4.  Cultivating Overseas Chinese Talent: To build a country, we must first build people. To build people, we must first build officials. If we want to build overseas Chinese affairs, we must first build overseas Chinese administrative staff, so that each overseas Chinese administrative official can play a major role and a great efficiency in the process of building the country and building overseas Chinese affairs. The people who run overseas Chinese affairs are not necessarily overseas Chinese who have returned to the country, nor are they necessarily people from places where overseas Chinese originated. Sometimes these people are not as good as people from other provinces, because these people have opinions, cliques, regions, clans, and other traditional animosities. If we want the great unity of overseas Chinese, it is easier for a middleman to take charge and preside over the matter to achieve a unified effect. However, people who have not been abroad to handle overseas Chinese affairs must go abroad for internship after training, and must visit and investigate several places overseas, so as not to make what they have learned become empty talk and turn office work into building cars behind closed doors. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is really a university of overseas Chinese affairs. They are exposed to it and immersed in it on weekdays. If they are willing to learn seriously, they may not be able to become experts in overseas Chinese affairs. The most important thing is that the country should establish overseas Chinese affairs or overseas Chinese institutes in several universities, select young people who understand, have enthusiasm, and have ambitions for the country, and cultivate talents in overseas Chinese welfare, management, education, economics, trade, and supervision. When necessary, short-term overseas Chinese training classes can be held. The more developed the career, the more talent is needed. Whether you want talent or not depends on whether you want a career or not.

### The United States Plans to Draft a Four-Power Treaty, the Soviet Union Proposes Six Amendments, the Content of Which Overturns the U.S. Draft

[United Press Moscow, 15th] At the Foreign Ministers' meeting today, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall urged the appointment of a four-power plenary subcommittee to draft a 40-year treaty on the disarmament of Germany in accordance with the terms proposed last year by former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes. The British and French representatives expressed their approval. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov did not directly express his approval or disapproval, but merely read out his previously prepared amendments, the content of which completely overturned the U.S. draft. The meeting was inconclusive and decided to postpone the discussion until tomorrow.

[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 14th] Article 1 of the four-power treaty proposed by Marshall today stipulates that: (a) The German army, navy, and air force, as well as all military-related units, shall be disarmed and disbanded; (b) Germany is prohibited from manufacturing military equipment in the country or purchasing military equipment from foreign countries; (c) Germany is prohibited from retaining military-related equipment or engaging in manufacturing and research for military purposes. Article 2 stipulates that until the Allied Powers cease to occupy Germany, the Four-Power Control Commission shall implement a monitoring system, and Germany's acceptance of the above two articles is a major condition for the Allied Powers to cease to occupy Germany. Article 4 stipulates that the Four-Power Control Commission shall report its work to the United Nations Security Council at any time, and shall notify the Security Council immediately when it believes that Article 1 of the Four-Power Treaty has been violated or is about to be violated. If Article 1 of the Four-Power Treaty is violated, the Four Powers shall take necessary actions using military force.

[Associated Press Moscow, 14th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today proposed six major amendments, all of which concern the Soviet Union's demands for a German peace treaty, and advocated that they be included in the U.S.-proposed Allied treaty in order to implement Germany's disarmament. The six amendments are listed as follows: (1) Include measures to eliminate German Nazism and implement demilitarization; (2) Stipulate four-power control of the Ruhr region; (3) Liquidate Germany's large enterprises and confiscate their property and return it to German state ownership; (4) Stipulate land reform measures; (5) Establish a democratic order in Germany; (6) The term of the four-power occupation of Germany should end only after Germany has fully fulfilled the payment of reparations, eliminated war potential, and established democratic politics, as recognized by the four countries. In this regard, Molotov's proposal is to demand that the treaty be redrafted, completely changing its foundation, and including the Soviet Union's demands, such as the four-power co-management of the Ruhr region, which the United Kingdom and the United States have resolutely opposed.

### Four Powers Reach Agreement on Free Exchange of Information in Germany

[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 14th] The expert committee on the free exchange of information throughout Germany has recently reached an agreement, the original text of which will be sent to the Allied Control Council in Berlin, which stipulates that the exchange of information and democratic ideas is limited to the following three items: (1) those required for the security of the occupying forces; (2) those required for Germany to fulfill its obligations to the Allied Powers; (3) those required to prevent the regeneration of Nazi or military movements. In addition, a special four-power meeting was held this morning, chaired by Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army in Germany, to discuss a number of issues related to Germany's disarmament and political democratization.

### U.S. Statement on German Peace Conference and Peace Treaty

[Agence France-Presse Moscow, 14th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall recently issued a statement to the press, saying that the United States proposes that the German peace conference should be in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, and all countries that have declared war on Germany should participate in the peace conference. However, when voting in the conference, countries should be divided into two categories: those with the right to vote and those without the right to vote. The former category of countries can be divided into two types: (1) Germany's neighboring countries; (2) Those who have militarily participated in the war against Germany. In addition, the United States proposed that a clause be added to the new German constitution authorizing the German government to ratify the German peace treaty. When the German citizens vote to approve this constitution, the entire German people should be responsible for accepting this peace treaty. Under this condition, the German peace treaty should be signed and ratified by the German government, and the United States does not express its opinion.

### France and Czechoslovakia to Sign Agreement

### Many German Generals Planned to Overthrow Hitler

[United Press New York, 14th] A new book by Allen Dulles, former director of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services in Switzerland, "The Underground Organization of Germany," is scheduled to be released today. It reveals that many German generals secretly plotted a coup in 1938, one year before the outbreak of World War II, to overthrow Hitler. However, when the coup was being secretly discussed in the office of the former German Army Chief of Staff Halder, former British Prime Minister Chamberlain suddenly came to Munich to seek peace, and the coup plan ended. This was caused by German democratic civil servants and generals, who believed that if a war broke out, Germany would be defeated, so they were determined to save it. However, Hitler's diplomatic victory in Munich led to the disappearance of the coup idea. Thereafter, secret plots continued, with coups and assassinations of Hitler combined, but all failed. Finally, a major exposure occurred in July 1944, and most of those in charge were executed.

### U.S. Supplies to Germany Total Approximately $500 Million

[U.S. Information Service Washington, 15th] From the end of the war to the end of 1946, the total value of U.S. supplies of grain and other materials was approximately $500 million. According to the U.S. military government report, from August 1, 1946, to the end of the same year, relief to Germany and displaced persons, just for the food bill alone, reached $395,460,000. Other materials such as medicines and petroleum amounted to several million tons, worth approximately $65 million.

### U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee Demands Indictment of Wallace, Wallace Has Expressed Disregard

[United Press Washington, 14th] Congress today demanded that criminal charges be filed against former Vice President Wallace and re-condemned Wallace's speeches abroad, but President Truman remained silent. The House Un-American Activities Committee intends to indict Wallace under the old Logan Act, which stipulates that any U.S. citizen who "conspires" with a foreign government to undermine U.S. policy may be sentenced to three years' imprisonment and fined $5,000. Committee Chairman Thomas, a Republican, said that the law applies to Wallace, the case is clear, and Attorney General Clark must indict him. Clark refused to comment. White House Press Secretary Ross declared that the President had nothing to say about the Wallace affair.

[United Press London, 14th] After Wallace's speech criticized President Truman's foreign policy, the U.S. Congress criticized him. Wallace responded here today with contempt, saying, "If a state of war exists, then my expression of my own opinion can be accused of promoting the enemy. But for the rest of my life, wherever people are willing to listen to my speeches, I intend to continue to express my views on peace."

### Stettinius Hosts Reporters, Discusses His Meeting with Stalin

[United Press Moscow, 14th] Stettinius, the U.S. Republican presidential candidate in 1948, hosted reporters here today and revealed part of the content of his conversation with Marshal Stalin last Wednesday, all of which concerned censorship and newspapers. It is said that Stalin told him that some American journalists harbor malice towards the Soviet Union, "It will be difficult for our country to abolish censorship." Stalin said that the news published by some reporters described the Soviet government "like a zoo." Stalin also said that the Soviets do not find any major differences between the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties. Stettinius said that the rest of the conversation, which concerned economics, will be published in a general report on the European economy that will be submitted after his return to the United States.

### Soviet Union Agrees to Begin Negotiations on Wartime U.S. Lend-Lease Account, Totaling $11.4 Billion

[United Press Washington, 14th] The State Department announced today that after six notes from the United States urging the Soviet Union, it finally agreed to discuss with the U.S. side the liquidation of the $11.497833 billion military lend-lease account, and negotiations can begin as soon as Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov returns to office. From March 11, 1941, to September 30, 1946, the U.S. supplied the Soviet Union with a large number of tanks, aircraft, and civilian equipment. How much the Soviet Union needs to pay is expected to be determined in this negotiation. After breaking fourteen months of silence on this matter, the Soviet Union may reapply for a $1 billion loan from the United States. The United Kingdom and France are the two countries among the five major powers that have already agreed to liquidate their military lend-lease accounts and have also obtained huge loans from the United States. However, because the State Department and the Kremlin cannot agree on the terms of this loan negotiation, the Soviet Union's request for U.S. post-war financial assistance has remained deadlocked to this day.

### U.S. Representative Speaks at International Trade Conference

Advocates That All Countries Should Make Mutual Concessions

[United Press Geneva, 14th] John Kindleberger, Deputy Leader of the U.S. Delegation and Economic Expert at the State Department, delivered a speech today to representatives of 18 countries at the International Trade Conference, asking them to negotiate the reduction of tariffs with the greatest speed. The United States promises to support mutually beneficial tariff schemes. President Truman has declared that the Geneva negotiations cannot fail. However, unless other countries respond, no country is willing to take unilateral steps, because etiquette is reciprocal, and all concessions must be reciprocated by corresponding concessions from other parties. The United States has previously submitted a table listing the concessions it is willing to make in terms of tariffs. Now, in view of the concessions that the other seventeen countries intend to make, it is prepared to revise this table.

### UN Special Session

Eagerly Awaiting Our Country's Announcement of Representative Candidates

[Central News Agency New York, 15th] According to reliable sources, when the United Nations General Assembly holds a special session on the Palestine issue on the 28th of this month, the United States will send one representative, and the candidate may be Austin. It is heard that the United Kingdom will also only send its representative to the Security Council to participate. The special session was held at the request of the United Kingdom, and United Nations Secretary-General officials hope that other member states will also save money for the United Nations and send as few representatives as the United States, because the United Nations budget has difficulties. However, the Secretariat has not formally notified the governments of various countries. Observers are now awaiting the announcement of the candidates for China's attendance at the meeting, and are universally concerned about their attitude towards Palestine.

### Churchill to Visit France

French Government to Award Military Medal

### Japanese Reparations Issue

Demands from Various Countries Exceed Total Value of Japanese Assets

[Asia East News Agency Tokyo, 15th] It is reported that the amount of reparations demanded from Japan by China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada, India, and New Zealand exceeds the total value of Japanese assets. The United States demands 130 to 150 billion U.S. dollars, and the amount proposed by China is even more than that of the United States. The figures demanded by other countries such as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are also considerable. However, MacArthur believes that the following two principles must be adhered to: (1) Allow Japan to retain industries that maintain the minimum standard of living for the people; (2) Distribute assets above this standard to various countries. In addition, the United States has priority to obtain Japan's liquid funds to be used for (1) the occupation expenses of the U.S. military stationed in Japan; (2) the payment for food supplies to Japan; (3) the payment for raw materials for reproduction to Japan.

### United Nations Headquarters Officially Accepted on the 13th

[U.S. Information Service New York, 14th] The United Nations officially accepted the New York City headquarters on the 13th of this month. President Truman issued a special statement, saying that the United States is very pleased with the progress of the United Nations, and expressed sincere gratitude to the people of New York for their "great act" of donating the headquarters to the United Nations.

### Gromyko Attacks Again: U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill

[United Press, Success Lake, 14th] Soviet Representative Gromyko today again attacked President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey at the Security Council session, demanding that aid to Greece be limited to economic aid only, opposing military aid to Greece and any aid to Turkey. Gromyko denounced the amendment proposed by Vandenberg, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as merely exacerbating the whole situation, and that such unilateral action was detrimental to the United Nations organization. According to Vandenberg's proposal, the U.S. could stop aid to Greece and Turkey if a majority of the eleven-nation Security Council or two-thirds of the fifty-five-nation General Assembly voted to do so, and the Security Council would not be allowed to use its veto power on this case. Gromyko denounced this move as a "preemptive arbitrary decision" on the United Nations' voting method, and that no country has the right to issue this. U.S. Representative Austin said upon leaving the meeting that he did not intend to reply to Gromyko again, and that he was now prepared to vote. The Security Council now faces three issues: (1) Austin proposed that the Security Council instruct representatives of the Balkan Investigation Committee to remain in the disputed area pending the Security Council's discussion of the investigation report. Gromyko believed this was unnecessary and therefore opposed it. (2) Gromyko proposed organizing a special committee to supervise all aid to Greece from any country. (3) Austin requested that the Security Council postpone discussion of Gromyko's proposal pending a decision by the U.S. Congress on what kind of aid to give to Greece and Turkey. The Security Council is scheduled to continue discussing the Greek issue on the afternoon of the 17th of this month.

### Student at Jiaotong University Killed by Car: District Attorney's Office Indicts Driver; Mayor Convened Mediation Yesterday; Texaco Company Agrees to Allocate 50 Million for Funeral; Family Awaits Court Decision on Compensation

[Reported by this Newspaper] In the case of Mai Zigan, a student at Jiaotong University, being killed by a Texaco gasoline company truck, the defendant, Huai Jintantang, was detained by the Xinshijie Police Station and sent to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. Prosecutor Lu Zhennan believed that the defendant confessed to the facts of the crime and said that the cause of the accident was "the brakes were not very good," and believed that the defendant, who was engaged in business, should have been aware and able to pay attention but did not, resulting in death, which constituted a crime under Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

Regarding this case, Mayor Wu convened a mediation yesterday morning with the manager of the Texaco Company and representatives of the students of Jiaotong University. At around 10 o'clock yesterday morning, more than 500 students from Jiaotong University marched to the Municipal Government to appeal. Later, because Mayor Wu insisted that the student ranks disperse, leaving only a few representatives to participate in the negotiations, Jiaotong University then sent 20 representatives, along with Tax Director Wu, Director Wang, Lawyer Yan, and more than 20 family members of the deceased, to the Mayor's Office to negotiate with the Texaco representatives. Mayor Guo immediately suggested two solutions: (1) Resolve through legal channels, which can be directly filed with the District Attorney's Office. (2) Self-reconciliation between the two parties. Mayor Wu also expressed his willingness to assist. Texaco Company believed that civil compensation claims were acceptable, but criminal responsibility should be borne by the driver himself. Although there were several compromises, no satisfactory result was achieved, because the distance between the two sides was still far. Jiaotong University, based on the opinions of the victim's family, requested Texaco to compensate the family's pension from the age of 29 to the age of 60, with a monthly amount of one million yuan, plus the deceased's education expenses, totaling 585 million yuan. Texaco initially only admitted 20 million yuan. Wu Shi, the company's American legal advisor, said that the company has always handled such cases in this way, with precedents to cite, which aroused dissatisfaction among the students of Jiaotong University. After Mayor Wu's mediation yesterday, the company agreed to first allocate 50 million yuan for funeral expenses today. As for family compensation, they will await the court's decision. The negotiations came to an end at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.

Also: This newspaper received a letter from the Student Union of Jiaotong University yesterday, the original text of which is as follows: "Respectfully, after reading the news published in your newspaper on April 15 about a Jiaotong University student being run over, and the 'detention' of a lawyer yesterday, it was found to be inconsistent with the facts. The details are briefly described as follows: Jia Junzigan, a student in the Department of Mathematics of our school, was injured and killed by a truck of the Texaco Company on the 4th of this month. The school authorities negotiated with the company and instructed it to take care of the aftermath and compensate the deceased for the loss. However, the company returned the official letter twice, saying that foreigners do not understand Chinese, obviously shirking responsibility. On the 14th, Texaco sent one Chinese and one foreign staff member to the school. Principal Wu Baofeng and Director Wang of the Living Management Group of the Training Department met with them. However, the two members refused to negotiate, saying that the family must come to Shanghai before a solution can be discussed. The principal, the student union, and the fellow-villagers association are not enough to represent the family. Moreover, their attitude was arrogant and their words were rude. All of this shows their disregard for the dignity of our country and blasphemy of the sanctity of education. Our classmates were extremely angry, but because our school values reason, we only asked them to notify the person in charge of the company to come and temporarily let the two of them rest in the affairs group, with tea and cigarettes, and lunch was provided. However, they did not contact the company, but reported to the Municipal Government, the Police Bureau, and the Consulate by telephone, falsely accusing the students' actions of 'detention', 'extortion', and 'blackmail'. Afterwards, they shamelessly spread rumors to the outside world and various newspapers. Their arrogance is so great that it is hateful. If we do not refute it sternly, how can we correct public opinion and maintain national integrity. Your newspaper has always been known for its fair and just arguments, and its upholding of justice, but the sections published on the 15th are very different from the facts. Please investigate and correct them." (Note: The news on April 15 published by this newspaper, "Jiaotong University Student Run Over, Mayor Urges Reconciliation," was a Central News Agency draft, and there were no words such as "detention," "extortion," or "blackmail.")

### Solving Fisheries Difficulties: Exchanging Revival Opinions; Opening Ceremony of the Fishermen's Associations Conference of Various Provinces and Cities

The representative meeting of the Fishermen's Associations of various provinces and cities held its opening ceremony at Henshe, Jianguo West Road, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 30 representatives from eight units, including Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Taiwan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Beijing, and Shanghai, attended. Representatives from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Water Conservancy Corporation, and the Shanghai Fish Market were also present. Xu Pan'yun, the chairman, delivered a speech.

Strengthening Solidarity and Developing Production

He briefly said: "The purpose of this meeting is to gather colleagues from the Fishermen's Associations of various provinces and cities to jointly discuss in order to solve the current difficulties in the fishing industry, exchange opinions on the revival of the post-war fishing industry, and hope to take this meeting as a starting point to organize a national fishing industry organization, so as to strengthen solidarity, consolidate maritime rights, and develop production." Then, Fang Lian, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered a speech: "He pointed out two points: (1) China's fishery production and technology are backward, and it is urgent to improve so as to catch up with advanced countries. (2) A national organization is conducive to the development of the fishing industry. I hope that all colleagues will actively work hard to ensure that it is realized as soon as possible."

Focusing on Fishery Loans and Fishery Salt

From 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., the meeting continued. Representatives reported on the fishery situation and plans of their respective provinces and cities, with particular emphasis on the two major issues of fishery loans and fishery salt. The representatives believed that, based on the current actual situation, the so-called fishery loans are often like drawing cakes to satisfy hunger, and even if there are occasional disbursements, the amount is extremely small, which does not help fishermen's production. The fishery salt distributed by the Salt Affairs Bureau, in order to prevent it from flowing into the black market, is mixed with red soil and yellow sand, which makes the salt products easily rot and discolor, causing huge losses to fishermen. Therefore, if we want to revive China's post-war fishing industry, these two major pains of fishermen must be fundamentally solved. According to reports, the meeting is scheduled to last for three days and close on the 17th. The proposals of various regions will be discussed tomorrow, and various fishing facilities in this city will be visited the day after tomorrow.

### Qian Nengxia Remanded for Retrial; Request to Summon Zhao Binggu as Witness; Allegedly Participated in Underground Work

[Reported by this Newspaper] Qian Nengxia, the former director of the Economic Bureau of the puppet Nanjing government, who was previously sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment by the High Court, was remanded for retrial by the Supreme Court. He was tried in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Qian claimed that during his tenure as the director of the Social Welfare Bureau of the puppet Nanjing government, he established rural welfare centers, civilian experimental centers, and housing rental consolidation and mediation committees, all of which were beneficial to the people. He also claimed that when he was working in the puppet Ministry of Communications on September 9, he was introduced to Zhao Binggu by Ding Mocun. Zhao was engaged in subversive work and often traveled between Shanghai, Nanjing, and various parts of the mainland. In 1943, the Southeast Working Group of the Military Commission was established, and Ding introduced the defendant to Huang Qingzhong to participate in the work of the group. In the winter of 1943, the group set up a radio station at Ding Mocun's residence at No. 12 Chibi Road, communicating with He Guoguang, the director of the General Office of the Military Commission. The defendant was assigned to manage the radio station affairs. After the victory, Zhao Binggu appointed him as the deputy director of the Nanjing Office of the Southeast Working Group. If Zhao Binggu can be summoned to court to testify, it can prove that the previous confession was not false. After a long trial, because evidence still needs to be investigated, the hearing was adjourned to a later date, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### The News Industry Makes Deng Sacred; It Should Not Be Destroyed or Insulted; Feelings of the Secretary-General of the Freedom Protection Association

Recently, incidents of beating up newspaper offices have occurred one after another in various places. He Yuanming, the secretary-general of the People's Freedom Protection Association of this city, expressed his feelings: "The news industry bears a sacred mission, praising the good and punishing the evil, and its contribution to the foundation of society, improving customs and habits, is above all else. It has also played its greatest role in advocating revolution and publicizing the War of Resistance Against Japan. Its merits are no less than those of soldiers who defend the country with their spears. How should we respect and cherish it, and how can we destroy and insult it? Recently, incidents of vandalizing newspaper offices have occurred in various places, and they are the hands of knowledgeable young students, which is very regrettable. If the newspaper has inaccurate records, you can conduct negotiations and solutions in a reasonable way. Now, resorting to force is not only the misfortune of the news industry itself, but also a bad trend in society. In this upsurge of democracy and freedom, we should first respect the freedom of others, and we must not misunderstand democracy, so as not to make foreigners laugh." It is heard that the association has also sent letters to the People's Freedom Protection Associations in various places to provide just and strict assistance to the destroyed newspaper offices.

[Reported by this Newspaper] One hundred bags of sugar recently transported from Taiwan to Shanghai are stored in the Xintai Chang Shipping Company at No. 1 Zhongzheng East Road.

All Teachers Suspend Classes to Demand the School Rectify Discipline

[Report from our newspaper] All teachers at the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road in this city suddenly suspended classes the day before yesterday and issued letters to students and parents. According to the spokesperson for the teachers, this action was a last resort, taken to urge the school to strictly enforce student discipline to maintain the future of education. Last Saturday, a few students, believing that the school's punishment of a certain student was "inappropriate," unreasonably demanded that the school retract its decision. They even forcibly entered classrooms, coerced teachers to stop teaching, and even maliciously insulted teachers, issuing leaflets attacking the faculty. In view of this, all the teachers of the school, considering that if this trend continues, the teaching profession would be disgraced and the school's discipline would be unimaginable, had no choice but to temporarily suspend classes and demand that the school strictly punish the students involved. Since yesterday, some orderly students have been attending temporary make-up classes with the teachers. Formal classes will resume as soon as the school fulfills all the teachers' demands.

Approximately six or seven schools in Shanghai, five or six in Hangzhou, and several schools in Suzhou will be designated by the relevant departments for the foreign guests from over twenty countries attending the conference to visit.

Boy Scout Council Relocates

Basketball Notes

Since the opening of the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament, the situation was most exciting last night. Hualian is indeed the most popular team, but their opponent, the US Navy Mingxing team, was weak and easily defeated, disappointing nearly a thousand spectators.

Da Li did not play, and Lao Bao also remained on the sidelines. Hualian fielded Xuesui, Adi, Xiangcheng, Guangyi, and Guorong. At the beginning, the five players used extremely beautiful and clear passing to break through to the basket and score. At this time, the Mingxing team had two or three shots, none of which were successful. Hualian took the lead with a score of 11 to 0.

Adi had to assist the two guards, Kong and Zhuo, in protecting their own basket, so Xuesui took on the responsibility of scoring. Once, he went straight to the bottom of the basket and successfully scored, and he spun to the ground behind the basket, winning applause from the entire stadium.

When the score was 17 to 5, Adi scored two consecutive reverse shots. Lao Kong, confident of victory, was at ease and scored two long-range shots. At halftime, Hualian was ahead 25 to 7.

In the previous game against Pei'er, it was already expected that Mingxing was only a mid-level team. If only shooting is considered, then they are not even comparable to mid-level teams.

In the second half, Zhang Liangxiong replaced Ren Xiangcheng. The score once became 31 to 7. The Mingxing team still fought tirelessly. This spirit is worth emulating. (Chang Nian)

Commander Xuan Delivers Speech Yesterday, Warning Shanghai Speculators; Economic Inspectors of the Garrison Headquarters Have Been Deployed

Yesterday afternoon, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with reporters and issued a stern warning to speculators who create rumors, manipulate monopolies, and raise prices. Xuan stated that speculators employ any means to achieve their goal of getting rich, seeking only profit. They must know that a few people getting rich means exploiting the right to survival of the majority of people. When the survival of the majority is seriously threatened, they will inevitably rise up in resistance. Then, the few speculators who "come for profit" will inevitably "leave with losses." Xuan also stated that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is most concerned about the price problem in this city and has instructed the municipal government and the garrison headquarters to jointly take responsibility, strengthen control, thoroughly investigate hoarders and speculators, and severely punish them. The garrison headquarters has now deployed economic inspectors to carry out work, and the results obtained will be transferred to the competent authorities for handling.

Analyzing the Reasons for Price Increases

Xuan analyzed the reasons for price increases. In addition to the artificial ills that should be eliminated, it is also necessary for the people of the whole country to be mindful of the difficulties of the current situation, reduce unnecessary consumption, practice frugality, and overcome difficulties together. Xuan expressed disagreement with the view that price increases are due to excessive demand and inflation. He believes that this is the view of capitalist countries, and it does not hold true in our country, which practices the Principle of People's Livelihood. He pointed out that the main problem with prices in our country lies in "waste" and "uneven distribution." If waste can be effectively curbed in terms of materials, and distribution is strictly implemented, then the seriousness of the price problem will disappear. As for inflation, the United Kingdom and the United States also had this phenomenon during the war, but the price problem was not serious after the British and American governments implemented material distribution systems.

Generate Power to Assist the Government

Regarding the implementation of the distribution system, Xuan said that the government has considered it, but he solemnly pointed out that the public should be aware, generate power, and assist the government, so that government orders can be effectively implemented. The root of all diseases in China today is that society does not yet have this power. Otherwise, all problems in China can be solved, he said.

Government Bonds Stable with a Weak Trend

Government bonds were initially stable yesterday but later weakened. There were rumors that the Assembly would intervene, making people more nervous. Although the physical bonds were advancing, the real estate offices 503 and 512 and retail investors were selling. The Class C bonds opened at 13,700 yuan in the morning, with a high of 14,200 yuan and a low of 12,400 yuan before settling down. As a result, compared with the previous close, Class A and B fell by 300 yuan, Class D fell by 200 yuan, and Class E fell by 400 yuan. Class C plummeted by 1,400 yuan, with a turnover of only 40,000.

Foreign Stocks Saw Mixed Ups and Downs

During yesterday's foreign stock trading, securities brokers, noting that the regulations requiring self-provided foreign exchange had been cancelled, predicted that the black market for gold and foreign currency would fall and decided to sell, resulting in weakness. However, land reclamation and coal mining stocks were favored and saw strong buying, resulting in profit. People from foreign companies continued to absorb Yi Sha and Mei Lian. Later, with the addition of buying from the Guangdong community, the market rebounded. Zhi Sha initially fell from 39,900 yuan to a low of 38,000 yuan, but ended with a high of 42,500 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, steel stocks fell slightly, land reclamation stocks rose by 10%, and Jardine Matheson, Wheelock, Yihe Brewery, and telephone stocks were flat, while the rest rose slightly.

Rediscount Committee Held Third Meeting Yesterday

The National Bank's Rediscount Committee held its third meeting at 3 PM yesterday, presided over by Qin Runqing, in the conference room on the third floor of the National Bank, lasting one and a half hours. The content included: (1) Of the 39 cases submitted by the Industrial Loan Review Committee, most are likely to be approved, with a total approved amount of approximately 1 billion yuan. (2) The Rediscount Committee decided to notify the Bankers Association to urge all banks and firms to submit cases regarding export material loans, as no cases have been submitted by the Export Material Loan Review Committee since its establishment. In addition, regarding whether the Industrial and Export Material Loan Review Committees are only limited to Shanghai or should be launched in major cities across the country, the Secretary-General of the Committee, Lin Chongyong, stated that this has not yet been considered. Currently, it is only being launched in this city. If the results are good in the future, it will be gradually extended to all parts of the country.

Foreign Tea Market Steady, Price of New Longjing Tea Tends to Soften

The foreign tea market, which had been sluggish for a long time, saw buyers still trying to lower prices, but sellers, considering that prices had fallen to a considerable extent, gradually became unwilling to sell at lower prices. Therefore, only Meixing traded yesterday, but the market was able to barely hold steady, with prices hovering. As for various domestic teas, there was little change in supply and demand, and the market remained steady. The source of new Longjing tea from Wen and Hangzhou continued unabated, but the quality was deteriorating. Traders often softened prices, resulting in a clear fall and a hidden stability.

[Additional News] According to news from the production area, the new batch of Tunxi Maofeng tea, known for domestic sales, has been priced in the production area at around 15,000 to 16,000 yuan per catty. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. It is also learned that, due to the warm weather this year, the products from various production areas are better than in previous years, and the harvest is very optimistic.

[Additional News] This year's new Longjing tea from Wenzhou has been on the market for two weeks since it appeared at the beginning of the month. In terms of supply, tea shops such as Tongtaixiang and Fuyu have been shipping tea continuously, with approximately 400 dan arriving in Shanghai so far. It is also heard that the production area has little left to produce. Although it is currently the peak season for tea trees, the leaves are no longer suitable for making Longjing tea and are mostly used to make fried green tea and baked green tea. Therefore, the supply of new Longjing tea from Wenzhou is expected to decrease sharply in the future.

Affected by High Prices in Production Areas, Rice Prices Continue to Rise; Poor Absorption of Red-Tipped Rice Sold by Social Affairs Bureau

[Report from our newspaper] Rice prices continued to rise yesterday, affected by high prices in production areas. The transaction price of white japonica rice reached 144,000 yuan, and other prices also rose. White yuan rice rose to as high as 170,000 yuan. The North and South markets received a total of more than 7,000 shi of goods, and the Social Affairs Bureau began selling red-tipped rice from northern Jiangsu in the market at a price of 120,500 yuan per shi, totaling 2,130 packages, but the market absorption was poor. Yesterday, the price of high-quality white japonica rice in Wuxi exceeded 150,000 yuan, and rice merchants found procurement and transportation difficult.

Flour Prices Rise

Fixed-price oil is still being rationed as usual, and the retail prices in oil shops remain unchanged.

Flour prices are gradually rising, with local flour continuing to rise by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and foreign flour rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Bran continues to rise by 1 to 2 yuan, and soybean cake is also selling well, rising by more than 1,000 yuan in a row.

Yellow soybeans are rare and can be hoarded, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Green beans from Southeast Asia are in high demand, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame is stable and firm, with supply falling short of demand for raw peanuts. Sales to Southeast Asia are strong, rising by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Red beans from South China continue to rise sharply, jumping by another 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Red sorghum rose slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, corn remained stagnant, and broad beans had poor demand and remained flat. Grain prices are rising sharply, with no end in sight.

Woolen Fabric Sales Strong, Prices Flat

Recently, the woolen fabric market has gradually improved. As the weather gradually warms up, actual sales have increased. Sales of men's and women's Chinese and Western clothing have been brisk, and merchants from all over the country have been replenishing their stock. The various groups on this street have made progress, resulting in lively wholesale and retail transactions in tea houses and large wholesalers and retail shops. Sales are mostly limited to light-colored, thin fabrics and summer goods. Prices remain flat, similar to previous days, without much fluctuation. There is a situation where prices cannot rise or fall.

Pharmaceutical Industry Leaders Petition for Foreign Exchange Allocation

The Pharmaceutical Industry Association of this city, in order to request a special quota of foreign exchange to resolve the raw material shortage, publicly elected Chairman Yi Kemin, Party Committee Members Bao Guochang and Ge Yong, and Committee Members Chen Mingshan, Wu Zhiwei, Huang Sufeng, and Zhou Wentong as representatives to petition the Import-Export Control Commission and submit a written request. The Director of the Quota Allocation Department, Mr. Li, received them and appointed Dr. Shao Jialin and Dr. Shi Zi Li as representatives to discuss the matter in detail. They expressed deep sympathy for the application for foreign exchange allocation to allow the import of raw materials and promised to convey it to the authorities, so that the foreign exchange problem related to the survival of pharmaceutical factories can be quickly resolved.

Cotton Yarn and Cloth Transported to Tianjin

[Report from our newspaper] The Linge freighter sailed from Shanghai to Taiwan the day before yesterday, carrying over 770 pieces of piece goods to Keelung. Yesterday, the Qimeilun sailed to Tianjin, carrying over 1,800 pieces of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, over 2,600 packages of food identification, and approximately 2,600 tons of general merchandise to Tianjin. The Garrison Headquarters sent personnel to investigate.

Sugar Market Announces Suspension of Trading

With the rising trend of the sugar market expanding, the Garrison Headquarters yesterday sent special personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth. To avoid responsibility, the Commission announced a temporary suspension of the market, causing people to become nervous and the black market to soften slightly. Off-exchange, Peruvian raw sugar fell to 355,000 yuan, and dry-packed raw sugar also fell by 10,000 yuan.

Yarn Prices Soar, Especially in Tianjin and Shenyang; Merchants Mostly Purchase and Transport Northward; Rising Raw Cotton Affects Cotton Yarn Costs

[Report from our newspaper] Although the yarn market has lacked formal market prices recently, the actual trading price of 20-count standard yarn has exceeded 5 million yuan per piece. Yesterday, the Northern merchants telegraphed that 20-count standard yarn could be sold for a net price of 5.3 million yuan per piece in Tianjin and 6 million yuan per piece in Shenyang (the above prices have deducted interest, wear and tear, and transportation costs). Therefore, even though the market price in this city is as high as 5 million yuan, a transfer can earn a net profit of 300,000 yuan per piece, so the merchants are happy to purchase and transport northward.

In addition, the cost of cotton clothing is currently increasing daily. For example, based on yesterday's price of 1.15 million yuan per load of 20-count yarn Indian raw cotton, each piece of cotton yarn requires three and a half loads of cotton, which already costs more than 4 million yuan. Adding processing costs of over 1 million yuan per piece, the cost of 20-count yarn per piece has exceeded 5.3 million yuan. If the yarn factories sell at the freely traded negotiated price in March, they will suffer losses. It is heard that since last week, the price of 20-count yarn quoted by various yarn factories has been around 4.7 to 4.8 million yuan.

(Another Report) According to people in the industry, yesterday's raw cotton market saw prices soar again after hearing that the authorities had cancelled the policy of allowing imports with self-provided foreign exchange. Before the relevant authorities set the relevant policy, the market price of 20-count yarn Indian raw cotton was approximately 1.1 million yuan per load. After the policy was agreed upon, various raw cotton importers planned to gradually raise foreign exchange themselves and place orders abroad. It was heard that the order price of 20-count yarn Indian raw cotton was 700,000 yuan per load, and adding the two-month interest, the cost was 900,000 yuan per load. Therefore, the market price gradually fell below the 1 million yuan mark. It was heard yesterday that the policy of allowing imports with self-provided foreign exchange had been cancelled, and prices rose again to 1.15 million yuan per load.

Glimpse of Off-Exchange Bidding

Yarn prices initially opened stable yesterday, but with a slight preference from factories and merchants from other ports, speculation became active, and bidding continued to rise. The off-exchange bid price of 42-count phoenix yarn broke the 10 million yuan mark, reaching 10.2 million yuan, and 20-count special double horse yarn was bid at 5.6 million yuan, and double horse was bid at 5.15 million yuan, but there were few transactions.

Cotton Cloth Sees Mixed Fortunes

Cotton cloth bids were mixed yesterday. As the authorities strictly controlled the market, it was difficult to buy new products. General speculators intended to sell at high prices, resulting in a weak market. Top-quality fine cloth was bid at 215,000 yuan, and Five Blessings was bid at 255,000 yuan, but it was heard that some were secretly selling at 190,000 yuan. There were no major changes in other colored cloths and linings. It was also learned that Morning Textiles Jiankai was selling various cloths yesterday, with the listed price for white plain cloth being 159,000 yuan for 20-count grade B, which was the same as the previous period, and the off-exchange bid price was 220,000 yuan.

General Meeting Discusses the Allocation of Union Cotton

[Report from our newspaper] The General Assembly yesterday specially convened various parties to hold a meeting to discuss the allocation of Union Cotton. Those present were Li Chemin and Huang Chengdao of the General Assembly, Kong Habao of the Union, Liu Wenteng, Director of the Business Office of the Textile Control Committee, and Li Gan, Chairman of the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Import-Export Control Committee. After discussion, it was decided that the allocation method of Union Cotton should first be based on the original allocation method set by the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee and the data provided by the Textile Control Committee. Priority will be given to the 39 units of various yarn factories in Shanghai that have purchased half of the cotton yarn acquired by the Textile Control Committee, based on their inventory levels and the urgency of their cotton needs. Consideration will be given to allocating cotton to various yarn factories in other ports. It is heard that the current stock of Union Cotton in Shanghai is approximately 90,000 bales. Currently, over 20,000 bales have been allocated, and 60,000 bales are awaiting allocation. In addition, 40,000 bales are expected to be loaded in Shanghai soon. As for the various grades of cotton and their prices, they were also determined separately yesterday. Cotton with a length of 7/8 inch and Middling quality was priced at 650,000 yuan per load. The prices of other grades will be reduced or increased proportionally.

This Year's Silkworm Cocoon Production and Sales Plan May Be Discussed at the Next Executive Yuan Meeting; The Goal is to Show Concern for Silkworm Farmers and Increase Production

[Report from our newspaper] It is learned that after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek listened to the elders of the sericulture industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Chu Fucheng and Leng Yuqiu, about the 36th year's silkworm cocoon production and sales plan, he ordered the Executive Yuan to review the case after returning to Beijing. However, due to the backlog of cases, the case was not submitted for discussion and approval at yesterday's Executive Yuan regular meeting. However, it is expected that it will be submitted for discussion at the next regular meeting.

Relevant parties emphasized that this year's cocoon production and sales plan was submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in March of this year. It is thought that the personnel changes in the Executive Yuan have caused a slight delay. However, as the matter has been ordered by the highest authority to be expedited, it is expected to be approved and implemented soon. However, the content of the plan is quite complicated. The technical problems of future implementation require much research. Moreover, in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the cocoon collection period will arrive in another month, and the time is very tight. Before that, it is necessary to make full preparations for various promotion work. Therefore, the authorities of the China Cocoon Corporation and representatives of the sericulture industry and silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are actively studying concrete opinions so that they can be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and coordinated implementation after the production and sales plan for this year is approved by the Executive Yuan.

It is learned that the total target of this year's silkworm production plan is 70,000 to 80,000 dan. Among them, the Guangdong area accounts for 14,500 dan, the Sichuan area accounts for 17,800 dan, and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas account for 35,000 to 40,000 dan. The government will purchase 30,000 dan of this total production at production cost for export to earn foreign exchange. The calculation of the cost of silkworm cocoon production this year is based on a ratio of one dan to four dan of rice (the ratio was 1 to 3 last year, and 1 to 5 before the war). The goal is to show concern for silkworm farmers and increase production. It is also learned that the national silk production volume before the war reached 278,000 dan per year. Therefore, the production volume in this year's plan is less than half of the pre-war volume. However, people in the silk industry observe that if prices are stable, domestic order is restored, and transportation is smooth, then the pre-war production volume can be restored within three years.

Three Reasons for Rising Silk Prices

[Report from our newspaper] The price of silk in this city has recently followed the price of everything else, rising step by step. The reporter specially visited a relevant authority yesterday to inquire about the reasons for the rise in silk prices. They said that the general rise in prices and the proliferation of currency are certainly the main reasons. However, in terms of silk itself: (1) Silk production has decreased after the war. Before the war, the production volume in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, including native silk, reached 100,000 dan per year. At present, the annual production volume is only 35,000 dan, approximately one-third of the pre-war production volume. (2) The silk stock in this city that can be circulated in the market is currently no more than 3,000 dan. Before the war, the stock was regularly maintained at 7,000 to 8,000 dan. At present, the stock is thin, and occasional price fluctuations often create a situation of supply falling short of demand. (3) There is a shortage of rayon in the market recently, and rayon has always been used by various silk weaving factories as a substitute for silk. The shortage of rayon has invisibly increased the demand for silk. All of these reasons are enough to promote the rise in silk prices.

### Jiangwan Airport: Reporters Gathered, Midnight Vigil, Waiting for Bombs: A Chronicle of the "Renault Bomb" Plane's Stopover in Shanghai

[Special Report by Our Newspaper] Since the victory, Jiangwan Airport has become the air transport hub of this city. Dignitaries come and go, welcoming the new and bidding farewell to the old. News reporters can often witness magnificent scenes there. At two o'clock in the early morning yesterday, Jiangwan Airport once again became the target of reporters' interviews. The "VIP" being awaited was the "Renault Bomb" plane piloted by the atom-pen king, Renault. On the silver-white searchlight-illuminated runway, they witnessed a historically significant and interesting scene.

The great ambition of atom-pen king Renault is to break the round-the-world flight record set by Howard Hughes in 1938. At that time, Hughes' record was 91 hours and 14 minutes. Renault hoped to reduce the time for flying around the world to 65 hours.

The U.S. Air Transport Command at Jiangwan Airport received news of Renault's arrival in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The control room constantly received phone calls from reporters from various newspapers, inquiring about the time of Renault's arrival. By 10 o'clock in the evening, more than 20 reporters were waiting at the airport for the landing of this supersonic aircraft.

However, there was still no news of Renault's special plane by midnight. According to a telegram from Calcutta, Renault took off from India at 6:03 PM Shanghai time. According to the estimate, he should have arrived in Shanghai by midnight. If there were no radio or other incidents along the way, the communication control room at Jiangwan Airport should have received reports of Renault's progress long ago. However, there was still no news after midnight. For a time, reporters and U.S. Air Force personnel at the scene suspected that Renault had encountered an accident while flying over the Hump.

At 1:45 AM, the receiver in the airport's communication control room suddenly received a very clear call sign. The loudspeaker repeatedly said: "Calling Shanghai Jiangwan Airport, calling Shanghai Jiangwan Airport!""Renault Bomb is preparing to land, Renault Bomb is preparing to land!" Thirteen minutes later, Renault's plane finally landed smoothly on the runway. After the special plane came to a stop, Renault happily disembarked, accompanied by his pilot, Odom, and his mechanic, Sally.

As soon as the plane landed, personnel from the U.S. Air Force rushed up to refuel, inspect the aircraft, and organize parts, while the reporters surrounded Renault to inquire about the flight. Zhang Peter, the chief of the municipal government's protocol section, stepped forward on behalf of the mayor to welcome him and presented him with a copy of the mayor's signed biography.

According to Renault, after taking off from Calcutta, he immediately increased his speed to 365 miles per hour. On the way, because he had to cross the Hump, the average flying altitude was above 19,000 feet. Regardless of whether Renault will be able to break the round-the-world flight record in the future, his flight time from Calcutta to Shanghai (eight hours) is already a new record.

Although Renault had not slept for more than 30 hours since taking off from New York, he did not appear tired. While his special plane was refueling, he went into the U.S. military cafeteria and ordered a ham and eggs meal to satisfy his hunger. His pilot and mechanic, however, collapsed under the wing of the special plane and slept for more than half an hour.

Before leaving, Renault took two specially made atom-pens and gave them to the mayor and Section Chief Zhang. He said that creating a new record of 65 hours was not a problem. Renault's mechanic, Sally, even sent a telegram to his fiancée, saying: "I will arrive in New York tonight on time. The wedding tomorrow will proceed as planned." Renault said with a smile: "I will make every effort to get back to New York tonight for my friend's wedding!"

At around 3 AM, the airport staff had prepared the special plane, and the fuel tanks had been filled with 1,200 gallons of gasoline, enough for a direct flight to Tokyo.

At 3:22 AM, Renault's special plane gradually moved towards the runway, and in an instant, it accelerated and took off from the ground towards Tokyo.

The reporters waited in the airport for five or six hours in the deep night dew. Only then did they breathe a sigh of relief. By the time they returned home, it was already dawn. Although they were extremely tired, they felt it was worth it to be able to see the real face of this fast plane that would create a new record in aviation history.

### Emergency Landing in Adak: Encountered Strong Headwinds En Route

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a United Press report last night, Renault's round-the-world flight special plane made an emergency landing in Adak in the Aleutian Islands at 6:25 PM yesterday (Shanghai time) due to a mechanical failure. The hope of creating a new record has suffered a serious setback. It is reported that after the Renault Bomb took off from Shanghai at 3:20 AM yesterday, it flew to Yokota Airport near Tokyo, Japan, at 6:58 AM on the same morning, stayed for 90 minutes, and continued to fly to Alaska. According to the estimated flight plan, it should have arrived at Anchorage in the Aleutian Islands at 8:23 PM on the same day. However, at an altitude of 19,000 feet over the North Pacific Ocean, it encountered strong headwinds, bad weather, and a lot of fog. Later, Seattle received news from Northwest Airlines in Anchorage that it had been forced to land.

[United Press Midnight Broadcast on the 15th] Renault's special plane left Adak at 9:27 PM (Shanghai summer time) and flew to Edmonton in Canada. Renault denied the claim that there was a mechanical failure on the plane. He said that he only made a temporary stop in Adak for safety reasons due to the bad weather. After arriving in Edmonton, he will fly directly to New York and still hopes to break Hughes' record.

### Fire Department Approved Establishment of Volunteer Fire Brigade
