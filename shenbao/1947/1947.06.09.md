### British Advisor Goes to Hong Kong to Discuss Preventing Smuggling

[United Press, Hong Kong, Eighth Day] The Chinese government is increasingly troubled by large-scale commodity smuggling in South China and is pressing the Hong Kong government to take measures to suppress it. Rogers, a British advisor to the Executive Yuan and the Central Government, has come to Hong Kong for the third time, accompanied by Chinese officials, to discuss this matter with the Hong Kong government. According to well-informed official sources, there is currently little hope of taking any action. They believe that the cause of large-scale smuggling should be attributed to China's strict import and export regulations. Another problem troubling the Chinese government is the flight of foreign funds to Hong Kong. Officials here also blame China for this, saying that the exchange rates set by the Chinese national banks encourage the transfer of foreign remittances to Hong Kong.

Heaven did not spare them, leaving us without consultation. Their achievements are inscribed on bronze tripods and vessels, their portraits painted in vermilion and blue.

At this time, when bandits fill the mountains and foreign troubles lurk, when the wind and rain are dark and the cicadas buzz noisily, we cannot but lament the passing of this experienced man. Tracing back to the revolution in the late Qing Dynasty, he served as a brilliant party member, inspired by the late Father of the Nation, revering him as a deity, abandoning his pen to join the military, aspiring to wait for the opportunity, and you were one of the most prominent among them. First forming an alliance in Jiangnan, then seeking refuge in the Northeast, and with your face to the island of Japan, your name became famous, and the world mostly did not know that Dun Chu and you were, in fact, his right and left hands. But fortune has its ups and downs, and times have their failures and successes. Continued achievements were not evident, Dun Chu having retreated to Japan, and you also hiding your tracks in the rivers, old comrades could not but sigh for you, but your spirit grew stronger, and your will became more firm. On New Year's Eve of the Gengxu year, you sold your fur coat and arranged a banquet, inviting all your friends and drinking until you made a decree, how magnificent it was. The following year, when the banner of righteousness was first raised, comrades in the Northeast contributed funds to support your journey, waving your hand to Qin Ning, laughing and riding in the carriage, with tears and laughter together, how heroic it was. Within a month, you had summoned all the strong men of the Huai and Si Rivers, and an army was formed day and night. The red flag of Jiangpu rose suddenly and prominently, and when you settled in Datong and entered Anqing, as the Governor-General of Military Affairs, opening a mansion in Anhui, how glorious it was. In the year of Guichou, the army was defeated, but your ambition was not diminished. In the intervening years, during the wars against Yuan and the protection of the Constitution, you traveled between Yunnan, Guangdong, Sichuan, and Hubei, in the tents and on the battlefields, great achievements were gathered, you can be called a good soldier. In the year of Bingyin, during the Northern Expedition and the establishment of the capital, you released your troops with a smile, content and at ease, which is enough to be a model for revolutionary soldiers. Twenty years of crusading against the fate of the military, twenty years of assisting the central authorities, hoping to determine fate and jointly face national disasters, although living in the capital, you still had the spirit of the mountains and forests, with a beginning and an end, without boasting or arrogance, alas, you were truly a complete man. At this time, when human desires are rampant and inexperienced youth are everywhere, the dens of jackals and wolves are right in the place where you used to advance, if you had knowledge, you would be overwhelmed with emotion! Alas, pacifying chaos and building the nation, we are relying on experienced men, why did Heaven not spare you, and took you away with your ambition? The pain is hidden in the yellow earth, as distant as mountains and rivers. A cup of clear wine is offered with respect and sincerity, may you examine and come. Alas, may you respond to our thoughts."

(3) The Public Memorial Text of the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to the late Member of the National Government, Liu Shangqing: "On the eighth day of June in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Zhongzheng, President of the Chinese Kuomintang, and all members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, with clear wine and offerings of grain, pay tribute to the spirit of the late Member of the National Government and Vice President of the Control Yuan, Comrade Liu Haiquan, saying: Looking west to the foot of the Bai Mountains, the Silver Ridge stands tall, the winding streams of the Chang and Liao Rivers flow nearby, responding to the essence of the mountains and rivers, a loyal and virtuous person is born, in youth, he developed literary talent and passed the county examination, then studied jurisprudence and managed the salt tax, economic development brought prosperity to the people, he met the loyal and steadfast commander, a hero in one area, a brilliant man who recognized the times and returned to the central government, to unify the great cause without hesitation, to manage the interior and govern the vast territory, to regulate the Lantai and be strict as the autumn frost, all these achievements, how can we record them all? Suddenly he became ill and traveled to a foreign land, medical treatment in Qin was difficult to cure the blindness, soul, return to us from the distant wilderness, looking to Dongyang there are many cicadas, the bear devours people and spreads rampant, when will the traveler return to his homeland? People lament and together with the emperor feel sorrow, members awaken and tears flow, spirit if you know, come and taste."

(4) The Public Memorial Text of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to Member Tan Zhen: "On the eighth day of June in the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, Chiang Zhongzheng, President of the Chinese Kuomintang, and all members of the Central Executive Committee, with offerings of flowers and paper money, pay tribute to the spirit of the late Member of the Central Supervisory Committee and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, Comrade Tan Liming, saying: You, comrade, a hero of Taoyuan, followed the Father of the Nation early on and made your name in the register, diligently studying jurisprudence, with a spirit that swallowed the Hu and Mian Rivers, the spirits of the Yangtze and Han Rivers shone, the waves of Dongting Lake surged, no battle was missed, returning to wield your weapons, although Chu had only three households, it would surely destroy Qin, the Han banners rose in four directions, and the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, the Republic was established, and together you planned for peace and security, you first received the mandate of the people and gave your opinions from the rostrum, embracing the principles and cutting off heterodoxy, having endured many hardships, you greatly helped the difficult times, assisting in the management of the judiciary, assisting the five powers, during the eight years of the War of Resistance, you returned together in victory, for forty years, the Party and the country relied on you, hoping that you would open up and assist, and that your plans would always be with us, but Heaven was unkind, and took away this virtuous man, the air darkened in Heng Mountain, and tears choked in the Yuan and Xiang Rivers, with sincerity and respect, we offer this incense, may your spirit come and accept it, and may it respond to our thoughts."

### Middle and Lower Level Members of the Democratic League in Various Places Submit Inquiries to the Headquarters; Written Answers Have Been Provided by Luo Longji and Others

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Eighth Day] It is learned that middle and lower-level members of the Democratic League in various places, feeling that the Democratic League itself is facing a crisis on all sides, have shaken their confidence in the organization and have submitted inquiries, writing to the League's headquarters to request clear answers: (1) How many democratic political groups have joined the Democratic League? (2) Who are the main figures of each political group? (3) Did Deng Chumin go to Hong Kong to plan for the relocation of the headquarters to Hong Kong? (4) Why did Hu Mingna write to the headquarters requesting to withdraw from the League? (5) What is the situation of the League's income and expenses? (6) Will the Democratic League parliamentarians participate in the Fourth Session of the Third Plenary of the Political Council? (7) Xu Deheng and others plan to contact the Democratic League to launch a peace movement. Does the Democratic League agree? (8) Why does the Democratic League adopt a secret system? (9) What is the future of the Democratic League? After receiving the above questions, the leaders of the Democratic League held several meetings to study and decided that Luo Longji and Zhang Bojun would jointly be responsible for providing written answers. The main points of the answers are extracted as follows: (1) The original participants in the Democratic League were three parties (namely the Youth Party, the Workers and Peasants Democratic Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party) and three factions (namely the National Salvation Association faction, the Vocational Education faction, and the Rural Construction faction). Since the Qingmin and Liang parties withdrew, the China Democratic Constitutional Government Promotion Association and the China Democratic National Construction Association were invited to join. (2) The main figures of each political group: Zhang Bojun and Qiu Zhe of the Workers and Peasants Democratic Party, Cai Tingkai and Chen Jiageng of the China Democratic Constitutional Government Promotion Association, Zhang Naiqi and Li Zhuchen of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Shen Junru, Shi Liang, Zhang Shenfu, Liu Wang Limin, and others of the National Salvation Association faction, Fei Yanpei and Jiang Hengyuan of the Vocational Education faction, and Liang Shuming of the Rural Construction faction. Other factions and individual figures include Zhang Lan, Du Qiancheng, Deng Chumin, Zhou Xinmin, Guo Moruo, Li Xiangfu, and Wu Han, among others. (3) The headquarters will not be relocated for the time being. Deng went to Hong Kong to represent the Democratic League at the Hong Kong celebration of the "May Fourth" Literary and Art Festival and the Youth Festival, and to contact the Democratic League's relations in Hong Kong. (4) Hu Mingna is the general manager of Hecheng Bank. The problem arose because Zhang Lan was involved in Hecheng Bank loans. This time, the Democratic League raised funds, and Zhang asked Hu to donate 10 million yuan, but Hu refused and requested to withdraw from the League. Shen Junru, Luo Longjin, and Zhang Bojun are mediating. (5) The headquarters has financial difficulties and has no choice but to solicit donations from members. Regarding income and expenses, you can check the accounts of each branch. (6) It is feared that it will be difficult to participate in this session of the Political Council without the consent of friendly parties (referring to the Communist Party). (7) The Democratic League does not take the initiative in the peace movement. (8) The headquarters sometimes has to keep the organization and personnel secret. (9) If the CCP can support itself militarily until the second half of the year, the international situation will change, and the Democratic League can then rise to prominence. The reason why the Democratic League does not participate in the government is to wait for this day.

### Although the CCP Refuses to Participate in the Conference and Calls for Peace, the Government's Plan Remains Unchanged and Drafting Peace Proposals Will Continue

[United Press, Nanjing, 8th] The Communist Party's official newspaper, the Liberation Daily editorial, categorically rejected the Political Consultative Conference's call for peace, disheartening members' enthusiasm for the peace movement. Persons close to the government said: This embodies the Communist Party's tendency to seize power, as indirectly announced by Mao Zedong after the cessation of peace talks last year. They pointed out that it is now clear that, unless a miracle occurs, peace talks in China cannot be restored, because the CCP's ultimate goal is one-party autocracy, rather than multiple parties participating in the government together, which is the same as the Soviet political forms in various parts of the world. Observers also said: It is expected that the Communist Party's attitude will not affect the government's new peacebuilding plan proposed for discussion in the next State Council meeting. This will be the government's final peaceful action against the Communist Party to resolve the internal conflict by political means. The government's immediate reaction to this is to continue drafting peace proposals. According to Interior Minister Peng Lisheng: The government will not modify its plan as a result of the Communist Party's broadcast.

Mr. Gu was participating in a weekly broadcast program by the National Broadcasting Company of the United States, together with the Indian Ambassador to the United States, to discuss "Asia's Responsibility in World Affairs." He said: China is eager to obtain financial assistance from the United States to promote economic recovery and increase agricultural and industrial production. China has no intention of using foreign aid for political purposes, such as balancing the budget. China's eagerness to accelerate its economic development is also because China occupies a most strategic front line in the global defense line for world peace. The United States has enormous economic power and should fulfill its responsibility to help freedom-loving nations restore and improve their economic environment. Mr. Gu also said: In world problems, the economic and political aspects are very closely related.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Dr. Gu Weijun said in his speech today: "The Chinese people have a deep faith in the motives of the United Nations organization. China believes that the United Nations is still in its long development period from infancy to adulthood. Before the United Nations can effectively guarantee world security and peace, it must improve its institutions and establish the necessary tools. Therefore, the Security Council should formulate satisfactory solutions to the issues of controlling atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction, organizing international police, and establishing military bases. The Security Council must reach an agreement on the issue of universal disarmament, especially on effective supervision and control."

### Authorities Begin to Stabilize the Economy, Military Spending Will Be Reduced as Much as Possible, and the Principles of Property Tax Collection Are Largely Determined

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Self-sufficiency will be the supreme guiding principle of our future fiscal policy. On the central government side, military expenditures will be reduced as much as possible, various administrative expenses will be reduced as much as possible, no new institutions will be added, and new projects that are unprofitable will not be undertaken. Furthermore, the current subsidies for various state-owned enterprises account for a considerable proportion of the total national expenditure. This kind of measure, in which "all the people bear the burden to reduce the burden of a part of the people," is not reasonable. In the future, this will be gradually reduced. Except for some poor provinces, the central government will no longer subsidize local finances in the future, so as to ensure that local finances can achieve self-sufficiency. What will complement cost savings will be revenue generation. This process will be slightly more proactive. After the work of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure is completed, the management and stabilization of the entire economy can be formally and concretely started.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The authorities believe that military expenditures are important to the balance of the budget, and the Minister of National Defense is not a member of the National Economic Commission, so there are many gaps in discussions. Therefore, it is planned to amend the Organic Law of the National Economic Commission and make the Minister of National Defense a member of the Commission.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The principles for levying a one-time property tax have been largely determined: (1) Property evaluation work will be assisted by local public opinion organs; (2) The collection agency will entrust local administrative organs to collect taxes on its behalf; (3) The tax objects will be both objects and people; (4) The tax rate will be progressive for the amount of property exceeding a certain limit; (5) The scope of property includes land and houses, as well as deposits and assets of Chinese people abroad.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Regarding the handling of foreign deposits and assets, diplomatic negotiations have not stopped. The past difficulty was that foreign banks refused to disclose the list of account names. The authorities are now trying to levy property taxes on such deposits and assets. This matter is different from expropriation in nature, and the negotiations are expected to succeed.

### Allied Powers' Treaty Terms with Japan: The US Government Will Make Proposals; The Date of the Peace Conference Has Not Yet Been Decided

[United Press, Washington, 8th] According to well-informed officials: The US government's proposals on the terms of the Japanese peace treaty have been largely completed, and when Secretary of State Marshall believes the time is ripe, it will begin consultations with relevant countries. According to them: the United States will undoubtedly submit various difficult issues, such as the date of the peace conference, the procedures of the peace conference, and the outline of the draft treaty, to the major countries of the East this summer, but the exact date has not yet been decided.

US officials anticipate that there will be no difficulties in resolving the territorial issues in the treaty. They believe that most countries will agree to the Soviet Union's rule of the Kuril Islands and South Sakhalin, as stipulated in the Yalta Agreement, and that the post-war borders of Japan should be restricted to within its native soil, as stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement. It is also believed that the United States' rule of Okinawa and other former Japanese islands, which the United States considers necessary for its Pacific defense line, will not cause serious disputes among the countries. However, regarding the economic issues of Japan, and regarding the issues of economic and political regulation of Japan, it is expected that various major differences will occur between the major countries. For example, it is expected that China and the Soviet Union will want Japan's economy to remain lower than the level that the UK and the US want it to maintain. Regarding the issue of long-term regulation of Japan, it is believed that China, the Soviet Union, and Australia may have very different opinions from the UK and the US regarding the form, degree, and period of regulation. However, officials in the United States believe that all issues are easier to resolve than European treaties, because there are no vastly divergent opinions regarding the territorial issues in the Far East.

### Japan Plans to Restore Foreign Trade and Plans to Set a Foreign Exchange Rate Before the Treaty is Signed

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese business people privately hope that Japan can follow the example of Italy and use a temporary exchange rate as a foundation to restore foreign trade before the treaty is signed. Regarding this matter, we can also mention the hopes of Japanese officials, that is, they hope that the treaty with Japan can be concluded in the manner of the treaty with Italy. Recently, the local English newspaper "Japan Times" published the full text of the treaty with Italy, with the title "Trying to Adopt." Japanese traders and industrialists are all looking forward to the restoration of foreign trade with great enthusiasm. When the US trade delegation visited, a large-scale raw silk exhibition was held in Tokyo last month. Shortly thereafter, the Foreign Trade Development Association, the Foreign Trade Association, the Foreign Trade Development Committee, and the Trade Association jointly organized a trade association to study the prospects for foreign trade after the war and to make some plans for the future. Last week, the Japanese government established a committee to study international trade regulations. Officials and business people are busy with various activities, hoping to reopen foreign trade. However, according to a reporter who learned from officials of the Japan Trade Bureau that they are cautious about the future of Japan's foreign trade and emphasized that the principle of controlled trade will not change until the treaty has not been signed. At the same time, the Association of Commerce and Industry conducted a survey of various trading companies, and the results showed that most of them are eager to first restore trade with the United States and China, and then with various parts of Southeast Asia. Japan is willing to export textiles, tea, cosmetics, and medical equipment, and hopes to import machinery, cane sugar, wood lacquer, fats, oils, and machine tools. The Association of Commerce and Industry is preparing to build the Tokyo Foreign Trade Building to exhibit Japanese products.

### Dredging Yunzaobang and Suzhou River: Shanghai Municipal Government Proposal Passed

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The National Water Conservancy Conference passed the proposal of the Shanghai Municipal Government to dredge the Yunzaobang and Suzhou River, and to build a connecting waterway between the two rivers, so that inland cargo ships can directly exit Wusongkou and connect with sea transportation. The contents of the case are as follows:

Reason: The Huangpu River, Yunzaobang, and Suzhou River (Wusong River) are collectively known as the first-class main rivers of this city. The deep-water coastline along the Pujiang estuary of Yunzaobang is an excellent pier location for foreign ships and a joint transportation station at the end of the Jinghu Line. The upper reaches of the Yunzaobang, from the north of Dachang District, enter Jiading County via the border of Baoshan and can connect with Taicang and Changshu water areas. The Suzhou River enters Jiading and Kunshan via Zhenru District and can connect with Wuxian County. In the past, the number of ships on the two rivers was comparable and freight transportation was smooth. In recent decades, siltation has become increasingly serious, and the riverbed is narrow and unbearable. Only during high tides can navigation barely be maintained, which has greatly affected the supply of rice and grain in the Shanghai area. Furthermore, various types of ships gather on the river surface of the Suzhou River below Caojiadu, and water transportation is almost impossible to maintain. It is urgent to find ways to disperse them. If the upstream can follow the tributary into Yunzaobang and directly connect to sea transportation, the congestion of the midstream and upper reaches of the Huangpu River can also be improved. For the above-mentioned two rivers, it is most appropriate to use the old river course from the Muguanggang Port of Suzhou River, via Yangshunanxiyi, to connect with Yunzaobang. It is most appropriate to widen and deepen it.

Method: For the above-mentioned projects within the jurisdiction of this city, the Suzhou River is 26 kilometers long, the Yunzaobang is 15.5 kilometers long, and the connecting tributary is 16.6 kilometers long. If a water depth of 2 meters is maintained at low water level, the required engineering funds will reach approximately 8.1 billion yuan based on current prices. It is proposed to subsidize 4 billion yuan from the central water conservancy funds so that it can be held immediately, and it is hoped that the water conservancy authorities of the province of Jiangsu province will dredge outside the territory of this city at the same time to facilitate navigation.

### Wuxi Daily and Evening Newspapers Cease Publication: Mediation Yesterday Did Not Yield Results

Various Agencies and Organizations Will Arbitrate

[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 8th] The five major daily newspapers in this county have been suspended for three days, forming a city without newspapers or printing. The headquarters, county government, council, county chamber of commerce, general labor union, and other agencies and organizations made the greatest efforts to mediate from 8:00 AM on the 8th to seek a rational solution to this serious problem. The results of the discussions are still not close. It is said that a public arbitration method will be used tomorrow. The Daily Newspaper Association is sincerely afraid that it will affect the newspaper associations in the counties along the Jinghu Line, so it telegraphed the Provincial Social Affairs Office, asking Director Niu to come to Wuxi to preside over the mediation. One of the evening newspapers decided to cease publication on the 9th, and the situation is very pessimistic.

[This Newspaper, Jiangyin, 8th] The Wuxi Evening Newspaper will act in concert with the Daily Newspaper Association and stop publishing in Cheng from the 9th. The Tide Report decided to change to a weekly to avoid disputes.

### Philippine Consul in Amoy Guilty of Corruption; Illegally Extorting from Overseas Chinese; Philippine Foreign Ministry Recalls for Investigation

### Kunming Market Stable; Grain Prices Decline Slightly

### President of the Viet Minh Republic Ho Chi Minh Issues Statement; Hopes for Moral Assistance from All Countries

[Reuters, Saigon, July 7th Dispatch] In a letter answering written questions from a reporter, the President of the Viet Minh Republic stated that if the French government could issue a clear new declaration regarding the Viet Minh, such as that issued by the British government for India and Burma, it would greatly facilitate the resumption of French-Viet Minh negotiations. Ho also said that the Viet Minh issue is not a French domestic issue, so the Viet Minh will submit this issue to the United Nations General Assembly when necessary. In referring to the attitude of various powers, Ho said that China views the Viet Minh as brothers, the United States has a friendly attitude, and Britain is either conservative or neutral. Ho then stated that recognizing the unity and independence of the Viet Minh is the minimum requirement for negotiations. Unity refers to the organization of a purely unified government by uniting Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin, with each of the three states establishing an autonomous government directly controlled by and responsible to the central government. Independence means that the Viet Minh people have the right to manage their affairs without external assistance. The Viet Minh government cannot allow only the merger of Tonkin and Annam, while Cochinchina awaits a popular vote to decide. Ho also said that the French side has said that establishing a solution with Ho Chi Minh will allow the Soviet Union to gain a foothold in Vietnam, but this is purely an excuse, as the Soviet Union did not even exist in 1916, while France has ruled the Viet Minh for eighty years. Ho Chi Minh personally may be a fascist or a follower of Confucius, but the Viet Minh government has representatives from various parties as well as non-partisans. Ho then criticized the French claim that the current turmoil was initiated by him, saying that the Viet Minh government desires peace and has therefore abolished the Supreme Resistance Committee and launched a three-year recovery plan, but the Viet Minh people will continue to struggle until unity and freedom are achieved. Ho finally issued a declaration to the people of the world, stating that the world's democrats must unite to protect the democracy of all countries, large and small, so that the rights guaranteed by the Atlantic Charter and the Charter of the United Nations can be enjoyed by all nations. Asian brothers, I hope that you will fully support the independent struggle of our Viet Minh compatriots. The Vietnamese people depend on the moral and material support that you can provide.

### The Truman Doctrine and the Far East

President Truman delivered a speech in Kansas City yesterday afternoon, reiterating that the United States has the firm determination to lead the people of all countries in the world towards a path of lasting peace. He stated that the United States should remain strong, develop its natural resources, improve agriculture, and increase production, so that the United States can provide the greatest assistance to countries in need. He also clarified the so-called Truman Doctrine, saying that the responsibility of the United States is to lead the people of all countries in the world in a way that provides assistance to the people of all countries who are experiencing misfortune and seeking freedom and independence, and to create world peace. The United States Army, Navy, and Air Force must remain strong, but since the surrender of Germany and Japan, the United States military has gradually demobilized and dispersed, which is tantamount to encouraging countries that see the weakness of peace-loving countries as an invitation to aggression. He concluded by saying that the people of all countries in the world should accept the principle that "there is no peace without sincerity," and that the United States should remain strong and have faith in fulfilling its responsibilities, which is the obligation of the United States.

After listening to President Truman's speech, we were reminded of the Washington dispatch from the United Press International two days ago, which stated in essence that "President Truman may reaffirm the United States' policy towards China in the coming weeks, because Chairman Chiang's work to expand the foundation of the government has made some achievements, so the obstacles to the US Export-Import Bank's 500 million loan have been completely cleared away, and Secretary of State Marshall is also strongly advocating for this, as he firmly believes that it is wise for the United States to assist the Chinese National Government as soon as possible." Although this dispatch is merely the speculation of UPI reporter Hansley, there are various signs that President Truman will indeed reiterate the necessity of the United States' policy towards China.

From a distance, the European political situation is deteriorating day by day. The coup in Hungary was created by the Soviet Union. Not only did the Hungarian cabinet change, but it also involved many foreign envoys. This is clearly part of the Soviet Union's political plan for the Balkan Peninsula. The second is Bulgaria. The arrest of opposition leader Petkov has created an atmosphere of fear in the Bulgarian capital, and opposition newspapers are being suppressed by the government, and there is the possibility of a political upheaval at any time. The same situation exists in Romania, where the Soviet Union is taking a high-pressure policy in Romania and may stage a coup similar to that in Hungary. The United States cannot turn a blind eye to the Soviet Union's interference in other countries' internal affairs. Needless to say, the United States is about to protest to the Soviet Union about the Hungarian coup and demand an investigation into the truth of the Hungarian coup. From this, we can see that US-Soviet relations have evolved to the stage of close combat.

Secondly, looking at the United States, there are three major events in the United States recently in terms of domestic and foreign affairs that are most worthy of our attention: (1) Secretary of State Marshall requested Congress to continue to aid European countries affected by war, not only aid to Greece and Turkey; President Truman stated to the press on the 5th that he would not abandon the plan to aid foreign countries. (2) The United States Senate had extremely divergent opinions on the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, but all amendments were rejected by the Senate, and finally they were approved by a majority of seventy-nine votes to ten; once these five peace treaties are ratified by France and the Soviet Union, they can formally take effect, and it can be seen here that the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States can still work together and adopt a bipartisan foreign policy. (3) The State Department requested the Senate and House of Representatives on the 6th to extend one of the President's wartime powers, namely the government's power to control export trade, for one year, so as to supply some urgently needed countries with goods that are still scarce in the United States.

From the above, it can be seen that recent US domestic and foreign policy is all implementing the Truman Doctrine. In theory, the United States is actively stepping up aid to China, which was originally not a problem. The US Export-Import Bank's 500 million loan could have been loaned to China long ago and used for the great cause of national reconstruction; but why has it not been realized to this day? This is very obvious, that is, the scope of implementation of the Truman Doctrine is limited to Europe, and China is still outside its scope of implementation. As the editorial in the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" stated two days ago: "Up to now, the US policy with the Truman Doctrine as its backbone has not included China in its scope of implementation. US policy towards China has been at a standstill since Marshal Marshall left China and returned home." At the same time, according to the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Gold, who returned to Shanghai from the United States, said: "The United States' view of China has not fundamentally changed. Although the United States itself has many difficult problems, it still expresses great sympathy for the disasters that China has encountered; but the recent trend is that emotional sensitivity is not as acute as before. The general public believes that both the friends of the country and China itself have made some mistakes after the war, and these accumulated mistakes need to be reflected upon. What we should do in the future is to pay attention to realism, in other words, to provide assistance only where it is effective."

However, the Truman Doctrine is essentially global, and its scope of implementation should not be limited to one corner of Europe, otherwise the Truman Doctrine will lose its unity. Moreover, the situation in China today is no different from that stated by President Truman regarding other countries. First, China has suffered from eight years of war, and its people have long been impoverished and its wealth exhausted, and its vitality has been greatly damaged, urgently in need of foreign aid and relief; second, the Chinese people all seek peace, democracy, and freedom, and sincerely hope to build a free and independent country by adopting innovation and reconstruction methods; third, China's biggest crisis at present is the threat of communism, so China needs US aid most urgently, even more than Greece and Turkey; fourth, under the current international environment, international relations are becoming increasingly close, and the world has long been indivisible. If the Truman Doctrine is truly based on peace and justice, then the United States' policy towards China cannot abandon the Truman Doctrine and follow others.

In short, it is time for the Truman Doctrine to be implemented in the Far East! The inconsistency of US opinions towards China has created the current static state. For the sake of lasting peace in the Far East, and also for the sake of the United States' own interests, the United States cannot allow this situation to continue for a long time, so the UPI reporter's statement that President Truman will reaffirm his policy towards China in the coming weeks is not only possible but also necessary! Let us wait here quietly for President Truman to make an important statement!

Deficiencies of the Draft Property Tax Law

At the previous direct tax conference, someone proposed levying property tax, and we immediately pointed out: (1) It is technically too difficult, (2) The result may still be that real estate is the main target. It is now heard that this plan has been drafted by the Ministry of Finance and will be submitted to the National Economic Commission for discussion on the 10th. The six standards proposed by the Ministry of Finance have (1) and (2) that are entirely real estate, (4), (5) and (6) that are partly real estate, and only (3) foreign exchange that is purely movable property. This is largely consistent with our predictions.

The reason for this is simple. In our country today, accurate statistics on households and land are still lacking. Personal property has always been a taboo subject, kept secret and unsuitable for discussion. The government has not conducted any form of investigation. Although there are tax registers for real estate items such as house rent and land tax, most of the registered names are not the real names, and local methods are not necessarily consistent. After the war, even this incomplete register was mostly lost and incomplete. If the situation of real estate is like this, what about other movable property? It is often heard that the authorities originally had a plan to conduct a general investigation first, which, although slow, was a very proper method. However, this time, the plan was hastily completed, avoiding the above-mentioned procedures. It was naturally necessary to cope with the current situation, but mistakes and omissions, uneven burdens, and other phenomena are feared to be unavoidable in fact. Looking ahead, we cannot help but feel worried.

Since the proposal to levy property tax was announced, there have indeed been many people in society who have expressed their support. The Senate recently also passed a resolution on this matter, as reported in the newspapers. In principle, we do not want to express any dissenting opinions again; however, upon careful examination of the arguments supporting this proposal, the focus is mostly on the point of "those with money should pay money," which is to say that the wealthy class should fulfill more of their tax obligations. Their argument is not unfair. The six standards set by the Ministry of Finance all have a starting point for levying the tax, and those who do not meet the starting point can of course be exempted from the tax. Their views can also be said to be the same. The problem is that movable property is hidden and difficult to investigate; all of the truly wealthy have long had a place to settle their cash and valuables, whether it is in the Americas or nearby Hong Kong. Moreover, it seems that the authorities have also stated that the (3) foreign exchange item is difficult to handle diplomatically and is practically a dead letter. In that case, the wealthy property that can be collected will undoubtedly fall below the second and third tiers. Judging from the original purpose, even if it is not greatly different, it will still be greatly discounted.

The starting point for the land tax item is set at more than 50 mu, and the scope of their vision is inevitably limited to one corner. Because the north is more sparsely populated and land is usually calculated in terms of hectares or squares. If the plan is implemented as it is, it will be equivalent to a general collection, which is somewhat different from the original intention of the plan. Also, the value of the house is set at more than 30 million yuan. In terms of numbers, it seems to be considerable, but in terms of current prices, houses below 30 million yuan seem to be in the minority in the city. Moreover, the housing shortage is extremely serious now, and rents have become unbalanced. Taking Shanghai as an example, the generally well-meaning landlords are running out of options, and this new tax still focuses on the real estate industry. It seems that only real estate owners are considered to be "easy targets," which, in theory, is not entirely satisfactory.

Now the national treasury is empty, and we have to resort to the means of increasing the issuance of banknotes to make up for it, which has led to inflation and economic depression, and the national economy is in a precarious situation. If we can open up another source of tax revenue to help adjust, there is naturally nothing wrong with it; however, the standards of the various property taxes set by the Ministry of Finance have too many shortcomings. Fortunately, it is still a draft, and it is not too late to mend the fence after the sheep are lost; it is hoped that the National Economic Commission must carefully discuss and decide before making a decision, so that we do not add another tax policy that disturbs the people in the midst of deep water and hot fire, and also prevent a law from being promulgated hastily, and soon being criticized to the point that the government admits that there are indeed loopholes, and then come to revise it, so as to damage the government's credibility!

### Soviet Union Extends Influence in Southeastern Europe; British Government Reviews Countermeasures; U.S. and Britain to Take Unified Diplomatic Action

[Reuters, London, 7th] The draft of the U.S. protest to the Soviet Union regarding Hungary, currently under study by the British Foreign Office, has necessitated a review of Britain's entire policy towards Central and Eastern Europe. The complete reorganization of the Hungarian government, the arrest of opposition leader Béla Kovács, the rehabilitation of Yugoslav opposition leader Ivanović, and the imprisonment of members of the Romanian American opposition have marked a new phase in the Soviet Union's influence in Central and Eastern Europe. Diplomatic observers believe these actions are part of a deliberate plan by the Soviet Union to consolidate the position of pro-Soviet elements in the region before the Balkan peace treaties come into effect and Soviet troops withdraw. The question Britain must decide now is whether to wage a genuine battle against serious violations of democratic freedoms, or to formally protest and then acknowledge the expansion of Soviet power, as in the past. The British government's decision on the U.S. protest to Hungary will serve as a guide to Britain's future attitude towards Central and Eastern Europe. The U.S. note states that it will bring charges before the United Nations, intending to oppose Soviet policy in practice, beyond mere formal protests. If Britain approves this policy, it will inevitably be unable to adopt a more lenient stance towards developments in Bulgaria and other countries. Well-informed sources believe that the United States and Britain will take similar diplomatic action in this regard, and it is expected that the two countries will continue consultations before formally submitting notes.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] Authorities responsible for diplomacy here state that the United States intends to present a note to the Soviet authorities regarding recent developments in Hungary. Before submitting it, they will seek the opinions of British officials. The wording of the note may be revised accordingly to reduce its severity. The British side believes that the current measures taken regarding the situation in that country should focus on establishing a three-member committee to investigate the entire situation in Hungary. Although the content of the note will not lose its resoluteness, it is generally believed that detailed information about recent developments in Budapest is still lacking, and it is not appropriate to form any final conclusions before understanding the situation. A State Department spokesperson said today that the note to the Soviet authorities has not yet been submitted, and he does not know when it will be sent, but after it is sent, Britain will also submit a similar note. Judging from general signs, the U.S. government does not intend to formally recognize the new regime in Hungary.

### Austrian Communist Party Attempts to Seize Power; United States Closely Monitoring; Romanian Prime Minister Arrives in Yugoslav Capital for Goodwill Visit

[United Press, Paris, 7th] Reports from Vienna today indicate that the Communist Party is plotting to control the Austrian government. From the capital, Britain has made a second stern request to the Soviet occupation authorities for information regarding the Hungarian Communist Party's seizure of power. Most Western diplomats believe that recent incidents are Stalin's response to the Truman Doctrine. At the same time, Romanian Communist Prime Minister Groza's visit to Yugoslavia is consistent with rumors of a Balkan bloc under firm Soviet control.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Government authorities declared today that the United States is now fully prepared, if necessary to prevent the Communist Party from seizing the Austrian government, to abandon efforts to sign an Austrian peace treaty as soon as possible. In this situation, the United States is prepared to continue occupying Austria indefinitely. Reports from Vienna indicate that the Communist Party's influence over the current coalition government has made the situation in Europe tend towards the type of developments seen in Hungary and Bulgaria. The State Department anticipates that this trend will spread to Czechoslovakia.

[Agence France-Presse, Yugoslav Capital, 7th] Romanian Prime Minister Groza and Foreign Minister Tătărescu, accompanied by the Minister of Economy and the Minister of Agriculture, arrived today for a visit. Yugoslav President Tito hosted a banquet to welcome them. During the banquet, Groza said in his speech that Romania does not wish to expect rescue from overseas, and our strength will ensure our salvation and guarantee our future. We will fight shoulder to shoulder with the Balkan countries to create and consolidate peace. If we can succeed, we can prevent war.

### Hungary Has the Right to Build Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union; Dinnyés Issues Statement

[Associated Press, Budapest, 7th] Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés stated to foreign reporters today that Hungary has the right to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union. When asked what attitude the Hungarian government would take if the matter were brought before the United Nations, Dinnyés said, "The Hungarian government will not keep any secrets and will answer all questions in the United Nations."

### Hungarian Communist Leader Seizes Great Power

[United Press, Budapest, 7th] The de facto dictator of Hungary is a short, bald-headed Soviet general named Rákosi. Although he only serves as Deputy Prime Minister, Rákosi has seized supreme power since the Communist coup on June 1, which forced Prime Minister Nagy to resign. He is a Soviet citizen, serving as a Major General in the Soviet Army, and is also the head of the Hungarian Communist Party. A year ago, Rákosi accompanied Nagy to Washington to negotiate and obtained U.S. promise to return to Hungary the gold seized from Hungary by Germany.

### Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy Discusses the Course of the Coup; Denies All Allegations

[Reuters, Geneva, 7th] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy issued a statement here today expressing surprise at recent developments in Hungary. He said that when I came to Switzerland for vacation, the domestic situation was quite satisfactory. On May 18, I received a phone call from Budapest informing me that Lieutenant General Sviridov, the Soviet chairman of the Allied Control Commission, had refused my request to hand over Béla Kovács, the former secretary of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, who had been arrested by the Soviet authorities. At the same time, he provided the Hungarian authorities with Kovács's written testimony, including accusations that I participated in a coup plot. Thereupon, Communist leader and Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi convened an emergency cabinet meeting, resolving to urge me to return home immediately. I telegraphed back that I was ready to return and stated that the allegations against me were groundless. The next day, I called President Tildy again, who also urged me to return and assured me that everything could be resolved. Hungarian Minister to Switzerland, György Gábor, then visited me, carrying letters from Hungarian friends, advising me not to return. I told him that I had decided to return and asked him to call President Tildy again to ask if his warning to me was credible. When I arrived in Bern, Gábor informed me that the President also advised me not to return. On May 30, State Minister Father Balogh called, saying that if I returned to Hungary, there might be accidents along the way, and he suggested that I resign to help resolve the crisis. I replied that the allegations were unfounded, and I had no constitutional reason to resign. However, in order not to make the situation worse, I agreed in principle to resign in accordance with the constitution. Therefore, I did not participate in any conspiracy. If there was a conspiracy, it was a conspiracy against me personally.

### British and American Political Representatives Visit Bulgarian Prime Minister

Inquiring about the Arrest of Petkov

[United Press, Sofia, 8th] The Bulgarian government issued a communiqué today stating that the U.S. and British political representatives to Bulgaria, Pennett and Horner, met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov (Communist) yesterday, with Foreign Minister Georgiev also present. The British and American representatives stated to the Prime Minister that the arrest of opposition leader Petkov might be of "international importance." The communiqué continued, stating that Bulgaria's handing over of Petkov to the judicial authorities was purely a matter of internal affairs, and it hoped that the public would patiently await the verdict of the Bulgarian Supreme Court.

### Eden on the Hungarian Political Situation

[Reuters, London, 7th] Former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech in the House of Commons today, stating that the events in Hungary are a blatant example of interference in the internal affairs of a small country. At present, due to a lack of sufficient information, a final judgment cannot be made. However, the events in that country are clearly an attempt to establish a communist regime in Hungary after the peace treaty comes into effect and Soviet troops withdraw.

### Palestine Fact-Finding Mission Leaves New York for the Holy City; Jewish Congress Condemns British Policy

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] Representatives of the United Nations Palestine Inquiry Committee departed by plane for Jerusalem yesterday. They were forced to return twice due to engine trouble. They took off again today, a total of thirty-six people, including Shertok, a member of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Zionist Movement.

[United Press, Lake Success, 7th] The United Nations Palestine Inquiry Committee announced today that 20,728 Jewish refugees in refugee camps in the U.S. occupied zone of Germany have applied to United Nations agencies to immediately facilitate Jewish immigration to Palestine. Previously, United Nations Secretary-General Lie announced that Britain requested that Jewish illegal immigration to Palestine be prevented during the committee's investigation. A spokesperson for the Jewish Congress said that Britain is asking United Nations agencies to authorize and cooperate with an illegal act, making member states accomplices to its conspiracy, which is unbelievable. Today, there are no criminals among the Jews immigrating to Palestine, and prohibiting them from immigrating is illegal. British officials did not immediately comment after hearing this statement from the Jewish Congress.

### Spanish Parliament in Dramatic Performance Passes Law of Succession

[Reuters, Madrid, 7th] The Spanish lower house passed the Law of Succession today, restoring the Spanish monarchy, but approving Franco's continuation as the head of state. All members of parliament stood up and cheered. At the same time, supporters of Don Juan, the heir to the Spanish throne, issued a statement in Madrid stating that royalists do not recognize this new law. Government officials expect Franco to submit the succession law to a public vote in early July, but some believe that the vote will not take place until after the summer. The order for holding the referendum has been drafted and is awaiting General Franco's signature. During the discussion, the Speaker of the lower house, Bilbao, defended the succession law, saying that since circumstances require a restoration, the restored monarchy must be a continuous and stable power, and a guarantee of national order. The king is for the people, not the people for the king. The parliament now proposes the establishment of a peace-loving regime to guarantee as much as possible that there is no danger of revolution. He added that Spain has no other leader besides Franco, so the restoration must be agreed upon with Franco, otherwise it cannot be restored. After Bilbao finished speaking, he loudly asked if the parliament passed this law. All members of parliament stood up and answered yes, and cheered for Franco for several minutes.

### U.S. to Expand Aid to Europe to Counter Pan-Slavic Alliance

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] Well-informed observers here, in studying Secretary of State Marshall's recent call for "unity" in Europe, are discussing the possibility of the United States providing $6 billion annually in aid to European recovery over the next three years. Washington believes that the immediate need is to help Europe make up for its trade deficits, and then supply the necessary production resources, the beginning of what is called a plan of mutual assistance among related countries. Officials here hope that Britain and France will respond to Marshall's call and first assist in the reconstruction of Europe. The United States cannot openly invite European countries to assist in a reconstruction plan that would prevent countries within the Soviet sphere of influence from participating, but Marshall's call at Harvard University clearly indicates that if Europe can help itself, the United States will immediately respond. U.S. officials fear that Soviet foreign policy will lead to the formation of a Pan-Slavic alliance by the countries of Southeastern Europe in the early summer of this year. If this happens, the United States, Britain, and France must immediately provide reconstruction assistance to the countries of Western and Northern Europe to counter it.

### Japanese Reparations Issue

—Translated specifically for this newspaper

The question of how much and what kind of industrial equipment Japan will give to its victorious nations as reparations will soon be clear.

(1)

If the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission is unable to break the current deadlock, then the United States will preemptively order MacArthur to allocate the Japanese factories and machinery designated as reparations to the countries entitled to apply for reparations. Therefore, the Japanese reparations issue is expected to be finally resolved within two months.

Judging from the current situation, Japan must hand over nearly 1,100 factories. Perhaps it will have to retain the entire textile industry as well as insufficient merchant ships and railway equipment; however, it must hand over all wartime factories and most of the steel, synthetic oil, rubber, shipbuilding and ship repair equipment, machine manufacturing tools, and chemical materials.

(2)

The United States is resolving the Japanese issue in advance, intending to enable Japan to become self-sufficient, thereby reducing occupation costs. MacArthur believes that in order to stop the current decline in Japanese industrial production, the reparations issue must be resolved as soon as possible. Some U.S. officials in Washington and Tokyo believe that Japan is using the United Nations' delay in resolving the reparations issue as an excuse not to reorganize the Japanese economy. Once this excuse is eliminated, Japan will have to implement the necessary economic reforms and strive to develop its remaining industries.

Since the Far Eastern Commission issued directives stipulating the minimum level of Japanese industry, the Japanese reparations issue has been largely determined. Since then, the occupying authorities have designated the factories that are not intended for reparations, allowing factory owners to begin restoring production.

(3) The final resolution of the Japanese reparations issue will be based on the recommendations of the U.S. Reparations Commission, chaired by Pauley in 1945, but the original recommendations have been amended by the Far Eastern Commission. Regarding the amount of Japanese industry that each country requesting reparations should receive, the Far Eastern Commission is currently trying to reach a resolution. This is an issue that has caused great controversy, and unless it is resolved quickly, the United States will carry out the allocation in its capacity as the main occupying power.

The main countries requesting reparations are China, Britain, France, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, and India. The United States does not intend to request any industrial reparations from Japan, but it may request some industries for the reconstruction of the U.S. occupied zone of Korea.

The secondary countries requesting reparations are: Canada, which participated in the defense of Hong Kong; Mexico, which dispatched an air force squadron to the Far East in the late stages of the war; Outer Mongolia, which fought against Japan for a few days; Portugal, which suffered losses in its Pacific territories and is requesting reparations; and Greece, Norway, and Italy, which are requesting reparations for damage to ships, etc., during the Pacific War.

The Soviet Union is partly responsible for the delay in resolving the Japanese reparations issue because it insisted that all Japanese assets in the nine northeastern provinces under Soviet control should be considered "war booty" and separate from reparations. The occupation authorities in Tokyo estimate that the Japanese assets already plundered by the Soviet Union are worth nearly two million dollars.

Thirty percent of the total amount designated for reparations by the United States will be dismantled and allocated to the Far Eastern countries and colonies most severely affected by Japan's war of aggression. When instructing MacArthur to begin the allocation, the U.S. government specifically emphasized that items that can be used for relief immediately should be allocated first.

In the early allocation of reparations, China will receive 15 percent, or approximately 165 factories. However, the Chinese government insists on obtaining another 15 percent in the final settlement.

Five percent will be allocated to the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, British Burma, Malaya, Hong Kong, and Borneo. Australia and France have voiced strong objections to the allocation method. Australia argues that it should receive a share to compensate for the damage caused by the Japanese army in New Guinea, and France believes that it should receive compensation for the damage in Vietnam.

Seven United Nations groups have been investigating industries in Japan that can be used for reparations. U.S. authorities have not yet received formal requests to designate certain factories or machines, so it appears that the dismantling of Japanese factories will not begin in the coming months.

The final decision on dismantling factories rests with MacArthur. MacArthur's current policy is to protect Japan's necessary factories and to prohibit the dismantling of any factory until its equipment and workers have been transferred elsewhere. Therefore, it is expected that the final resolution of the reparations issue will not seriously affect the Japanese economy.

### Marshall Plans to Submit Refugee Immigration Bill to the House, Advocates Allowing 400,000 to Immigrate Over Four Years

[United Press, Washington, 7th] It is reported that Marshall and his staff will attend the House Judiciary Committee to request the House to pass legislation allowing 400,000 refugees to immigrate to the United States. The legislation is currently being studied by the Judiciary Committee, with most members expressing opposition to the current form of the bill. The bill was proposed by Representative Stratton, allowing 100,000 refugees to immigrate to the United States each year for four years. A House member said that Marshall will attend the House hearing after the subcommittee reports the legislation to the full committee. Secretary of the Army Patterson and Attorney General Clark may also attend the House hearing. A few members of the subcommittee said that they were optimistic about the committee's report on the bill. It is rumored that some members are considering reducing the number of refugees allowed to enter and shortening the period allowed for entry. Supporters of the bill expressed fear that if Congress fails to pass the bill, other countries will not participate in the plan to resolve the issue of millions of refugees in Europe.

### U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan, Roosevelt Has Already Set a Precedent

U.S. Representative to Greece, Paul, said

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 7th] Paul, former U.S. Price Administrator and current U.S. Presidential Special Investigator on the Greek issue, said at a dinner party for leaders of the Liberal Party today that the late President Roosevelt, in his speech in October 1937, had already set a precedent for today's plan to aid Greece and Turkey. I strongly support President Truman's aid plan because this plan can enable Greece to establish political freedom and free the country from the fear of aggression. However, it is an undeniable fact that there are many corrupt and reactionary elements in the current Greek government. In short, American isolationists should also appeal to peace-loving people to make them understand that if President Truman's plan is not implemented, there will be no peace.

### Wallace Speech

Explaining Attitude Towards the Democratic Party

[Agence France-Presse, Montgomery, 7th] Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace, speaking here, said: It is still difficult to say at this time whether I will leave the Democratic Party in 1948. If the Democratic Party becomes a party representing war and injustice, then I will no longer be able to support it. The Truman Doctrine is not based on a peace plan, but on a war plan. If this continues and expands, the result will inevitably lead us to a recession. At this point, someone asked if it was possible to organize a third party. Wallace immediately replied that he would do whatever he thought was necessary for peace.

[United Press, Montgomery, 7th] Wallace continued his national speaking tour here, saying, "Finding an agreement with the Soviet Union is the main task facing those who formulate American foreign policy."

### Floods and Tornadoes Cause Disaster in Northeastern United States

[United Press, Chicago, 7th] The United States today encountered floods and tornadoes again. At least forty people died, more than 16,100 were displaced, and property damage amounted to tens of millions of dollars. Rivers in Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Nebraska, and Kansas swelled, flooding both banks. Tornadoes passed through Pennsylvania and Ohio. Sharon, Pennsylvania, was hit hardest by the tornado, and Warren, Ohio, was also hit by a tornado. At least two people died and about one hundred were injured in each city. Flooding was most severe in Ottumwa, Iowa. About one-third of the city's 32,000 residents had their homes flooded and had to move out. At least seven people drowned. The Des Moines River flooded, leaving about 16,000 people homeless.

### General Hodge Released Working Report of Korean Military Government in Tokyo Yesterday; Expanded Authority of South Korean Legislative Assembly

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] As the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission's plan for a Korean provisional government entered its third week, MacArthur disclosed the Korean military government's working report for February on the 8th, stating: The United States has guaranteed the South Korean provisional legislative assembly "a wide range" of government responsibilities. Items that have been submitted to the legislative assembly for discussion include the early formulation of a universal suffrage law and universal suffrage regulations, discussing methods to prevent inflation and tax increases, as well as controlling the black market and salvaging industrial production. In addition, the Korean legislative assembly opposed the suggestion of employing Japanese technicians in Korean industry by an absolute majority of forty-nine to zero. In addition, the U.S. authorities also hope that the Korean legislative assembly will carry out land reform, implement labor laws, eliminate all personnel in the military government who sympathize with the former Japanese oppressive policies, collect grain, allocate and dispose of Japanese property. Lieutenant General Hodge issued a proclamation on February 5, reiterating that the work of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission has not changed the 1945 Moscow Resolution and that it is promoting its realization.

### Mountbatten Consults with Indian Leaders on New Measures for Dividing India; Also Urges Indian Interim Government to Resign

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 7th] A radio station here has just issued a message stating that Indian Governor-General Mountbatten held meetings with leaders of the Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Sikh community this morning to discuss measures to be taken to divide India.

[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] Reliable sources say that Indian Governor-General Mountbatten has requested the entire current Indian interim government to resign. This is believed to be in preparation for establishing two interim governments immediately upon the implementation of the partition plan. In addition, Nehru and his colleagues will submit their resignations in early next week so that the central government, which cannot avoid partition, can be divided into two governments, Pakistan and Hindustan, before the end of June. [Reuters, New Delhi, 7th] After holding a two-day meeting with three leaders from the Congress Party, three leaders from the Muslim League, and one Sikh leader, Indian Governor-General Mountbatten is expected to determine the charter of the border demarcation committee for the provinces of Bengal and Punjab. These seven major leaders are Nehru, Patel, and Kripalani from the Congress Party, Jinnah, Ali Khan, and Nishtar from the Muslim League, and Singh from the Sikh community. The Muslim League Council is scheduled to meet on Monday to approve Britain's plan to transfer power in India because Jinnah only offered verbal acceptance with reservations, and the final decision must be made by the Muslim League Council.

### Respect for Freedom of Residents of French India

It is also reported that the Governor-General of French India, Baron, stated that the National Congress would not exert pressure on the residents of French India. Nehru and Jinnah have both acknowledged that the residents of French India have complete freedom to decide their future constitution. The future of the Gorkha people has yet to be decided. A senior Indian military officer stated that approximately 16,000 Gorkha soldiers in ten brigades were originally planned to be retained within the Indian Army. It is now understood that approximately 8,000 soldiers in five brigades will be incorporated into the British Army and stationed in Ceylon. Therefore, the Indian Army will only retain approximately 8,000 soldiers.

### Argentine First Lady Arrives in Spain for Visit

[Agence France-Presse, Madrid, 8th] It is learned that the wife of Argentine President Perón arrived in Spain today for a visit and will later visit Britain and France in a private capacity.

### Soviet Union to Establish Legation in Siam

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 7th] According to the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Union will send diplomatic representatives to establish a legation here. The delegation of twenty people is expected to arrive in mid-October of this year. Diplomatic relations between Bangkok and the Soviet Union were about to be restored when the last World War broke out, but negotiations were unable to continue due to wartime conditions.

### German Prime Ministers' Conference Concludes, Adopts Multiple Resolutions to Be Submitted to Allied Control Council, Prime Ministers of Soviet Zone States Did Not Participate

[Reuters, Munich, 7th] The conference of the prime ministers of the states in the British, American, and French zones of Germany, which was held here, has now declared its conclusion. As a result, multiple resolutions have been formed, listing various demands to be submitted to the Allied Control Council and the military governments of each zone. Since this conference decided not to discuss the issue of political unification, the prime ministers of the Soviet zone states withdrew before the conference. The issues involved in the resolutions include food, coal, industry, denazification, and transportation. The main points include allowing Germany to enjoy fishing rights equal to those of other countries (including whaling), land reform, the minimum coal needs for this winter, establishing a prisoner-of-war control bureau, and that denazification laws should apply to all zones. The economic resolutions also call for loans to import food and raw materials so that German traders can participate in the world market. Other requests include reducing the burden of occupation, seeking the opinions of German experts to immediately revise Germany's industrialization plan, and that relations with the occupying countries should be determined in accordance with the Hague Convention. Observers were surprised by the boldness of the aforementioned requests. Six months ago, such a request would have been unimaginable. The intention of the conference is clearly to use these resolutions to attract public attention, showing that it is not affected by the withdrawal of the prime ministers of the Soviet zone. However, it is generally believed that the latter's withdrawal is sufficient to indicate the failure of this conference.

### Municipal Food Allocation Committee Established Today, Overseeing the Rationing of Rice, Grain, and Cooking Oil, Investigation of the Number of Poor People to Be Conducted in Each District Starting Today, Distribution of Food Rations for Public School Employees for May Begins

The Municipal Food Allocation Committee of this city is scheduled to be formally established at the Shandong Native Place Association Hall at 10:00 AM today and begin its work. The concurrently serving Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Wu Kaixian, will hold an establishment meeting with all committee members and discuss various issues. It is understood that after the establishment of the committee, it will carry out three important tasks: (1) The allocation of rice to factories and schools has been registered by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the first batch of more than 20,000 shi (a unit of dry measure) has also been approved. In the future, the committee will be responsible for unified management. (2) The allocation of rice to impoverished households, the implementation measures have been approved by the Municipal Council. The investigation of the number of impoverished households will be carried out by the Baojia (local administrative units) chiefs in each district starting today, to serve as the basis for issuing rice ration certificates. (3) For the allocation of cooking oil, the existing Joint Food Oil Allocation Office will be under the jurisdiction of the committee to ensure unified allocation. In addition, the allocation of rice to factories and agricultural schools will soon be expanded, and professional personnel and industrial workers will be able to enjoy the right to rice rations. In August, it will be further expanded to a city-wide household ration of one dou (another unit of dry measure) per person.

In addition, according to the person in charge of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, the warehouse has prepared rice for the city's rations and is determined to open four warehouses every day, with a maximum output of 12,000 bags per day. It is also stated that the municipal school employees' food rations for May have been notified to the rice and flour shops to begin receiving goods, and they can be sold separately starting from today.

### City Council Authorizes Discussion of New Standards for Slaughtered Animal Weight

[Our Report] The slaughter tax rate in this city is 5%, and the tax amount and weight of slaughtered animals are subject to a specified average standard. Cattle are calculated at 200 catties (a unit of weight) per head, calves at 33 catties, sheep at 20 catties, and pigs at 80 catties. Because the Municipal Finance Bureau had previously decided to actively reorganize tax revenue at the City Council meeting, it believed that the specified weight standards were inconsistent. After sending personnel for on-site inspections and investigations, a total of 125 heads of cattle were weighed, with a total weight of 44,494 catties, averaging 355 catties per head. It has been verified as 300 catties, an increase of 100 catties compared to the original standard. The average weight of calves is 51 catties, which is verified as 50 catties, an increase of 17 catties compared to the original standard. The average weight of pigs is slightly more than 86 catties, which is verified as 80 catties, remaining the same as the original. Each sheep will also remain at 20 catties. However, the verified standards are opposed by meat merchants, who believe they are too high. The case has now been authorized by the City Council plenary session to be discussed by the subcommittee.

### Intensify Preventive Work to Eliminate Summer Epidemics

[Our Report] With the arrival of midsummer, cholera has not yet been discovered in various parts of the country. However, because it was quite prevalent last year, it is generally predicted that there will still be some lingering effects this year. The municipal health authorities have paid close attention to this and are intensifying preventive work. Among the 200,000 shantytowns in the city, which are considered sources of infection, 70-80% have been vaccinated against epidemics. Other measures, such as fly prevention and elimination, opening water sources, DDT spraying, food and beverage management, and soil disinfection, are also being implemented in conjunction with each other. The immunization goal for this summer is 2 million people, and more than 400,000 people have been vaccinated so far.

### Dispute over Foreign Currency Deposits of the Former French Municipal Council, French Consulate Sends Letter to Liquidation Team, Hoping to Continue Negotiations for Resolution

[Our Report] Although the method for former Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese employees to register for and receive retirement benefits has been announced, the issue of the payment of savings funds for former French Concession employees and police officers has not yet been resolved. The reason is that the Liquidation Team of the assets and debts of the former French Concession held a meeting and decided: (1) Chinese employees of the former French Concession police force can register with the savings certificate issued by Mr. Fabre, the former Chief of the French Police; (2) The multiple of increase shall be calculated according to the salary multiple of civil servants of the Shanghai Administrative Organ at the time of payment; (3) The savings to be paid shall be paid from the foreign currency deposits of the former French Municipal Council in banks such as Chase, Citibank, and HSBC that have been frozen. The remaining amount will be requested from the central government. After the decision was made, a notice was published in the newspaper asking the Chinese employees of the former French Police Department to register. From April 16 to April 30, a total of 1,143 people registered, and the total amount of their savings when the pseudo-municipal government took over the French Concession in 1942 totaled Central Reserve Bank notes 1,253,488.16 yuan. If it is refunded according to the conversion of 200 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes to 1 yuan of legal tender today, very little will be obtained. Therefore, it was decided to calculate and pay according to the multiple of the civil servant's salary.

The current problem is the foreign currency deposits of the French Municipal Council in banks such as Chase, Citibank, and HSBC that have been frozen, totaling US$1,275,211.15 and £14,579 14 shillings and 1 pence. The Chinese government believes that assets must be liquidated in order to assume debts, and these deposits should be returned to the Chinese government. On the French side, it is said that after the pseudo-government took over the concession, the French government advanced a larger amount of money to cover the living expenses and return travel expenses of the French employees of the former French Concession administrative authority than the amount of the deposits, and should be used to offset the outstanding payments first. However, the municipal government found in the files taken over that the French side had agreed with the pseudo-government that the maintenance costs and return travel expenses would be borne by the French side, so it does not recognize this. At the previous plenary session discussion, Mayor Wu had a disagreement with the French representative due to this issue, and the issue was delayed. It is now learned that the French Consulate General sent a letter to the Liquidation Team yesterday, hoping to continue negotiations in order to seek a solution.

### YMCA Launches Summer Program

Anyone who applies will receive 300,000 yuan once accepted, but the lyrics or scores must be submitted to the YMCA by the 15th of this month. (2) Summer Academy for Employed Youths - The courses of the academy are divided into journalism, politics, economics, literature and art, history, psychology, philosophy, etc. It will be open from July 1 to August 31, for a total of two months. As for the swimming pool, it will also be open immediately, and a summer camp for young people will be organized to be held in Xikou and other places.

### Municipal Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei Broadcasts, Public Health Facilities and Measures Over the Past Year, With Summer Approaching, People are Warned to Maintain Cleanliness and Protect Health Together

[Our Report] This newspaper held its tenth Sunday special broadcast at the Cooperative Radio Station yesterday, inviting Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau to speak on "Public Health Facilities in This City Over the Past Year." The following is a record of his speech:

It has been exactly one year since I took office as the Director of the Health Bureau on June 10 last year. I will now divide the public health facilities of the past year into five items and give a comprehensive report.

Prevention and Control of Epidemics

(1) Prevention and Control of Cholera: Last year, cholera was prevalent. After the joint efforts of all sectors of society to cooperate and inject vaccines, vaccinations have already started on April 16 this year, with the goal of completing 2 million people. Other measures, such as disinfection of patients' homes, disinfection of drinking water, opening 74 fire hydrants, adding safe water supply stations in civilian areas, DDT eradication of flies and mosquitoes, and other measures such as saline injections, stool inspections, and traffic quarantine, are all sufficient to reassure the citizens. This year, we will promote prevention work even more vigorously. (2) Compulsory Vaccination: In the spring of this year, compulsory vaccination was implemented, and 1.5 million people have been vaccinated as of May. Other diseases, such as diphtheria, meningitis, epidemic typhus, dysentery, smallpox, scarlet fever, and relapsing fever, have also had sporadic cases, but thanks to our efforts in prevention and control, they have not become widespread. There have been more cases of dog disease, but the mortality rate is still low.

Cleaning Work

(1) Garbage Removal: The average daily garbage production in this city is approximately 2,500 tons. The population has increased after the war, but there are only 3,500 sanitation workers. In addition, due to high prices and insufficient budget, the amount of garbage removed in a year under such difficult circumstances totaled 900,000 tons. (2) Removal of Feces: The average daily number of vehicles of feces to be removed by the Cleaning Bureau in this city is 7.315. However, the work is greatly affected due to the dilapidated vehicles and the long-term disrepair of the docks. We are now planning to solicit bids from merchants to contract the work in order to improve it. On the one hand, we still have to emphasize that citizens pay attention to public morality and jointly maintain cleanliness in order to be effective.

Medical Relief

(1) Increased Free Beds: The number of beds in municipal hospitals in this city was originally only 909. A total of 400 beds have been added over the years. The municipal government has allocated funds to subsidize 278 fully free beds and 235 half-free beds. This year, 50 free beds for tuberculosis patients and 40 free beds for laborers have been added, and free clinics are also subsidized. (2) Low-Priced Medicine Distribution: Two mobile clinics provide completely free services in poor areas. Recently, 100 members of the Medical Association and more than 70 pharmacies that are members of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association have been specially contracted to add the stamps "Poor" and "Low Price" to prescriptions, which can be used to reduce fees and provide preferential treatment.

Insurance Diversification Facilities

(1) Maternal and Child Health Care: 5,332 people had prenatal check-ups, 5,372 people had safe deliveries, 9,511 post-natal care visits, 160 mothers' meetings, 465 children's meetings, and 497 infant health clinic visits in various municipal hospitals and health offices in the past year. (2) School Health: In the past year, student health examinations totaled 86,756 people, defect correction 127,831 cases, disease treatment 19,184 cases, isolation of infected persons 180 cases, vaccination 89,425 people, health education 142,146 times, and environmental hygiene inspections 1,742 times. (3) Children's and Youth Health Campaign: In the past year, a total of 72,760 children and youths participated in health examinations. The number of people whose defects have been corrected is 20,940, and defect correction is still in progress.

Medical and Health Management

All hospitals, doctors, dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, pharmaceutical students, nurses, midwives, Chinese and Western medicine merchants, as well as vegetable markets, milk farms, slaughterhouses, public cemeteries, crematoriums, mortuaries, funeral homes, barber shops, bathrooms, food commodities, and vendors in this city are under the jurisdiction of this bureau for health management. We pay close attention to cleanliness and hygiene and supervise and correct them at any time. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that midsummer is coming soon. Cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, malaria, enteritis, etc. are all summer epidemics. They may be discovered any day. Please everyone be vigilant at all times, be careful about diet, prevent malarial mosquitoes, be diligent in cleaning, and protect our homes together.

### Cries Outside Xiaonanmen, Miracle in the Fire, More Than 40 Thatched Sheds Burned Down, One Household in the Center is Safe

[Our Report] More than 40 thatched sheds have been built in the Diandang Lane area of Nancang Street outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi, and most of the residents are tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers. At 2:10 PM yesterday, Zhu Dezhuang (28 years old, from Huai'an), a resident of No. 28, accidentally dropped sparks on the thatched shed while cooking, causing a fire. In addition, the wind fanned the flames, and in an instant, they spread to the neighboring shantytowns, turning them into a sea of fire. After receiving the alarm, the Shanghai South District Fire Fighting Association immediately dispatched more than ten pump trucks to rescue the fire. Due to the narrow location and lack of water sources, the fire was not extinguished until 4:30 PM. When reporters went to inspect the scene after the incident, they saw that all the thatched sheds had turned into scorched earth, and some women and children were still trying to find relics in the ashes. Many people were wailing in grief. The most amazing thing is that the Zhang family's shed at No. 57 in the center was safe and sound. Mrs. Zhang believes that God is protecting them, so she specially prepared incense candles to light and worship Heaven.

### Joint Conference of Labor Associations Discusses Wage Issues, Petitions the Minister of Economic Affairs Afterward, Requesting Restoration to the Base Figure of Late 1936

[Our Newspaper's Report] Industrial Association Directors Hu Boxiang, Rong Hongyuan (represented by Zhang Mengzhao), Yan Yaoqiu, Dong Shuying, Tian Heqing, and members of the Industrial Trade Associations' Living Cost Index Wage Study Group Liu Qingyi, Ye Fukan, Yang Liren, Xue Huichen, Yao Siwei, Qian Mengwei, Pan Xingyu, Song Baolin, Zhang Zhiming, and fourteen others, held a joint conference yesterday afternoon at the Industrial Association on Xiangyang Road to discuss the issue of wage payments after the lifting of the living cost index freeze. They immediately drafted a telegram to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting two things: (A) that wages be paid according to the current living cost index, and that the wage level of 1936 be restored as the base for wage calculation; (B) that before a reasonable adjustment to the living cost index and base salary is obtained, this month's wages be temporarily paid according to last month's index.

Planning to Organize Security Insurance

As factories fear worker strikes or the threat of gatherings, they plan to establish a security insurance organization through the Industrial Association. If any factory is destroyed by worker violence, the organization will fully compensate for the losses, while the Industrial Association will legally file a lawsuit, demanding compensation from the authorities and the labor union. (This proposal is temporarily reserved for detailed planning by the Industrial Association's board of directors.) They also plan to request protection for factories from the security authorities to strictly prevent illegal activities by workers. At the same time, it was resolved that each industrial trade association should investigate the evolution of pre-war and post-victory wages in their respective industries, as well as the actual income of workers calculated using the existing base salary and index, filling out a detailed survey form to be submitted to the central government by the Industrial Association for reference. After the meeting, all representatives went to the International Hotel to petition Minister Chen of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who was in Shanghai, and submitted the aforementioned telegram. Hu Boxiang, Tian Heqing, Yan Yaoqiu, and others described the current crisis facing the industrial sector and the difficulties faced by factories under the pressure of high wages.

Promise to Submit Request to the Executive Yuan for Discussion

Minister Chen promised to forward their requests to the Executive Yuan. Regarding the adjustment of the living cost index or base salary, he will also consult with the heads of the Ministry of Social Affairs and other relevant departments after returning to Nanjing to seek a balanced solution that takes into account both protecting workers' livelihoods and ensuring the "reproduction" capacity of employers, submitting it to the National Economic Conference for discussion. Representatives of the Industrial Association will gather at the Handkerchief Trade Association on Jiujiang Road at 9:00 AM this morning to petition the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau again.

### A Milestone in Railway History: The Railway Bureau Self-Manufactures Streamlined Train

The Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Administration, considering the high cost of ordering vehicles from abroad, directed its Qishuyan Machinery Plant to independently manufacture a single vehicle to save foreign exchange. After several months of effort, four blue steel-skinned cars have now been officially completed. According to the Railway Administration's plan, a complete train will be manufactured, including seven first-class passenger cars, one dining car, and one baggage and guard car, for a total of nine cars. The interior is fully equipped with air conditioning and heating, and the seats and windows are the latest style. The car body and underframe are electrically welded. The bogies are currently being prepared by the plant and are expected to be completed within a few months. Streamlined steel-skinned passenger cars have long been popular abroad, but this is the first time they have been created domestically. The Railway Administration's self-manufacture of streamlined passenger cars, with all designs based on European and American models and incorporating scientific methods, is truly a milestone in China's railway history.

### Husband Values Righteousness, Young Woman Heartless: Returned Veteran Finds Wife Remarried, Irrefutable Evidence of Bigamy Found

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhou Laifu, a Jintan native residing at No. 134 Baoyuan Lane, Zhabei, married a fellow villager, Genying (currently 21 years old), a few years ago. After their marriage, their relationship was very good. Last spring, they returned to their hometown together and temporarily made a living by farming. At that time, the countryside was conscripting soldiers. According to the Bao Tian Chu regulations, Zhou's elder brother should serve. Zhou, considering that his brother had many children and would have no one to take care of them if he were conscripted, agreed with the Bao Jia Chu to serve in place of his brother. Unexpectedly, after her husband joined the army, Genying secretly came to Shanghai, asked someone to be a matchmaker, and remarried Huang Jinming, who makes straw rain covers (lives at No. 1, Huahuacheng Lane, Xiaoximen, Nanshi). This year, Zhou Laifu returned home and could not find his wife, so he came to Shanghai to search for her. After learning that his wife had abandoned him and remarried, he went directly to the Penglai Sub-bureau to accuse Huang Jinming of seduction. The police were dispatched to arrest him and also found two copies of the wedding invitation with "Heaven and Earth Made" written on it. With the evidence in hand, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial according to law.

### Russian Criminal Difficult to Subdue, Speech Impediment Causes Panic in Prison, Then Resort to Violence

Russian criminal Gajigarou was previously sentenced to three days of detention by the Changning Road Medical Inspection Bureau for committing violence against others. On the 6th, Gajigarou was in the detention center of the Changning Road Police Station, and because many other Chinese prisoners were talking and discussing enthusiastically, Gajigarou wanted to join the conversation, but due to language barriers, the other prisoners ignored him.

Fortunately, the police officers of the bureau quickly sent him to the hospital for treatment, and Gajigarou was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on the charge of assault.

### Regulations for Purchasing Enemy and Puppet Buildings Set by the Liquidation Office

Regarding the enemy and puppet buildings on privately owned land and the enemy and puppet buildings on land requisitioned by the enemy and puppet regimes, regulations have been formulated for unified handling. However, it has recently been discovered that some enemy and puppet buildings are not built on the land of the same owner, and the land has been approved for return or redemption of property rights after application by the owner. Except for land with barracks and airport buildings, which are requisitioned according to law, the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office is now formulating a method for other alley residences: (1) The landowners will jointly purchase the building. If the landowners cannot jointly purchase, and one of the landowners is willing to purchase alone while the other landowners express their willingness to give up, they may be allowed to purchase alone. (2) If none of the landowners are willing to purchase, the government will take over and sell the building through bidding. This method will be implemented after it is reviewed and approved by the Enemy and Puppet Property Review Committee this week.

### Zhang Boling Returns to Tianjin Tomorrow - Expresses Thoughts on Student Protests to Reporters Yesterday

[Our newspaper's dispatch] Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, having completed his participation in the Political Consultative Council, came to Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago and is scheduled to return to Tianjin tomorrow with Professor Zhang Zi-jian of the university via China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight. The Shanghai Alumni Association of the university welcomed Mr. Zhang at Fengzelou in the International Hotel yesterday at 3:00 PM, with more than 70 alumni in attendance. In his speech to the alumni, Mr. Zhang first stated that he personally was not as optimistic about the current situation as before, but he was not pessimistic about it. He said that domestic peace and stability are what the people of the whole country are seeking, and the Political Consultative Council had organized a special committee for this purpose, spending a day and two nights thoroughly researching and discussing the peace plan, still based on the two points of "political democratization and nationalization of the army." The plan was submitted to the government for reference and announced to the people, and it is hoped that members of the Chinese Communist Party will come to Nanjing to jointly seek a path to peace. Mr. Zhang used the analogy of the country being a house, and if the walls collapse and the house falls, everyone will suffer damage. He encouraged the alumni to take the "nation" as the premise, to maintain composure, and to overcome difficulties together. Mr. Zhang was pleased that the Nankai alumni working in the Tianjin municipal authorities, the Senate, and various other aspects in Tianjin were able to cooperate seamlessly. Subsequently, Professor Huang Zi-jian, who came with Mr. Zhang, reported on the school's affairs in great detail, and explained that the political consciousness of young students is now higher than before, but the political struggle of Nankai students is not as sharp as that of other universities, and there have never been any incidents of mutual beatings. This is because they can all understand that students also have the identity of citizens, and can engage in any political activities outside the school, but within the school they only know how to study. The professors also never have factions due to different political opinions. This is all due to President Zhang's influence. Later, at the request of reporters, Mr. Zhang expressed his feelings about the student protests, saying: This student protest cannot be said to have no background, nor can it be said to have a complete background. The main reason is that it was triggered by high prices. If the authorities of each school had been able to properly resolve the students' livelihood problems in advance, the student protest might not have expanded so much. Also, according to Professor Huang Zi-jian of the engineering school; the establishment of the College of Engineering at the school, with the establishment of three departments of chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, has been approved by the Ministry of Education and is currently undergoing procedures. Enrollment will begin next semester.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Discusses Fuel Issues, Remedial Measures Have Been Drafted, Textile Adjustment Committee to be Established Soon

[Reported by this Newspaper] Economic Minister Chen Qitian, accompanied by Vice Minister Zhang Zizhu and others, went to the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to individually summon the heads of various institutions affiliated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai for discussions. Those present included Securities Supervision Officer Wu Zongbi, General Manager of the China Silk Company Ge Jingzhong, Director of the Spinning and Construction Company Wang Dasui, General Manager of the China Vegetable Oil Factory Zhang Yujiu, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee Xu Letian, and Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau Cai Wuji. The meeting concluded at 12:00 PM.

When Chen met with reporters at 11:00 AM, he stated that the purpose of his trip was to inspect the affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and talk with the people in charge. As of today, there are several things that can be reported: (1) The fuel problem is very serious due to the difficulty in obtaining sources. I have thoroughly discussed it with Mr. Xu Letian and drafted remedial measures, so there will be no major problems at present. (2) The government has decided to establish a Textile Adjustment Committee to replace the former Textile Management Committee. During my visit to Shanghai, I have consulted with Mr. Zou Rongwen three times. Mr. Zou is an agricultural expert and has studied the textile industry, so I have invited him to serve as the chairman. After personally requesting him, there are generally no more problems. After I return to Beijing and determine the organizational measures, the Adjustment Committee can be established in the short term. It is expected that after the establishment of this committee, it will greatly benefit the improvement of the production and sales of yarn and cloth in our country.

(3) Yesterday afternoon, I had a sincere conversation with the responsible personnel of the Spinning and Construction Company. All members had previously submitted their resignations, but after my repeated persuasion, they have agreed to continue to be responsible. During the tenure of former Minister Wang, General Manager Shu made outstanding contributions to the development of Spinning and Construction. With his vast experience and responsible work ethic, the future of the Spinning and Construction Company is very promising. Yesterday, I visited the 17th Textile Factory and Dyeing and Weaving Factory of the Spinning and Construction Company and was very impressed, but I regret that I was unable to inspect everything due to the limited time. (4) On the evening of the 6th, the heads of the affiliated institutions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai hosted a public banquet for me at the Jinmen Hotel. The responsible personnel in Shanghai are all working hard and diligently, which is commendable. I am determined to be humble and sincere, seek truth from facts, and ensure that technical personnel and working staff can work with peace of mind. I am also willing to accept any good suggestions. Shanghai is an important location and has a close relationship with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. I hope to have close cooperation with the municipal authorities and leaders of the business community to solve various economic problems, especially those related to Shanghai. Furthermore, yesterday at noon, Xu Jigong, Li Ming, and other leaders of the Shanghai business community hosted a banquet for Chen at the Hongqiao Club. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mayor Wu will hold a tea party to introduce Chen to various people in the city.

### 蠶絲產銷協進會通過　委託代收春繭辦法
### The Silk Production and Sales Promotion Association Passes Measures for Entrusting the Collection of Spring Cocoons

[Reported by this Newspaper] The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee recently passed a measure for entrusting the collection of spring cocoons at its sixth committee meeting. The full text of this measure is as follows: 1. In order to regulate the funds used by cocoon firms in various regions for collecting cocoons, the association has negotiated with the China Silk Company to borrow funds from the China Farmers Bank and hand them over to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang offices of the association for regulation. (The northern Anhui region will be handled by the China Silk Company itself.)

2. The regulation of funds for cocoon firms is limited to the following two items:

(1) Cocoon firms that have been approved for establishment but have not yet had manufacturers come to collect cocoons, and where it is necessary to establish a firm to collect cocoons.

(2) Cocoon firms of various manufacturers whose funds for collecting cocoons exceed the prescribed quota and have no remaining funds available for transfer, and where there are still surplus cocoons in the area, the quality of the cocoons is good, and the equipment and management of the cocoon firm are complete.

However, in cases where manufacturers have cocoon loan remittances that have not arrived and there is an urgent need to pay cocoon farmers, they may be given a discretionary advance loan, but after the remittance arrives, it should be repaid as soon as possible.

3. When entrusting cocoon collection, the group leader, together with representatives of the cocoon firms and cocoon collecting manufacturers, shall sign a contract for entrusted cocoon collection with the association's office, and each cocoon collecting manufacturer shall be responsible for guaranteeing it.

4. The quantity of entrusted cocoon collection shall be approved by the office at its discretion, and cocoon funds shall be paid at any time according to actual needs. When cocoon collection is completed, any remaining funds shall be returned in full immediately.

5. When receiving cocoon funds, the group leader accepting the entrusted cocoon collection shall, together with each cocoon collecting manufacturer, fill out a receipt form, attach a receipt, and submit it to the office or branch office for verification before drawing from the lending bank. In addition to the receipt form being kept and transferred as required, a copy of the receipt shall be submitted to the association for record.

6. The entrusted small group and the manufacturer of the entrusted firm shall strictly comply with the regulations of the association in terms of the drying discount, reeling discount, payment of cocoon prices, and all expenses of the entrusted cocoon collection. If there is any fraud in drying or any other violation of regulations, the small group and the manufacturer of the entrusted firm shall bear full responsibility.

7. The silkworm cocoons collected on behalf of the entrusted party shall be allocated proportionally according to the regulations and the actual amount of cocoons collected at the end of the cocoon business. After entering the warehouse, all the dry cocoons allocated shall be handed over to the China Silk Company for storage. When allocating the excess cocoons collected by each cocoon firm, the dry cocoons shall be distributed by drawing lots based on the total amount of dry cocoons dried by each cocoon firm and the proportion of fresh cocoons collected. The cocoon price and all fees paid shall also be borne proportionally within the prescribed limits.

8. The procedures for distributing the above-mentioned silkworm cocoons to manufacturers will be determined separately. However, the manufacturers of the contracting small group and firm shall be given preferential treatment to reward their labor for handling the agency.

9. The various reports to be filled out and submitted for entrusted cocoon collection shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the association, but the words "entrusted cocoon collection" must be clearly indicated for identification.

10. All procedures for entrusted cocoon collection shall be handled in accordance with the various regulations of the association. Any matters not covered shall be decided by the association on an ad hoc basis.

### 蘇省繭汛　量志質均有進步
### Jiangsu Province Cocoon News: Volume, Quality, and Enthusiasm All Improved

[Reported by this Newspaper] The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Economy, considering that cocoon firms in various parts of Jiangsu have all started weighing, dispatched personnel to Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places on the 5th of this month to inspect the cocoon collection situation in various districts. It is understood that the general impression of this inspection was very good. Since the price of cocoons was increased by 20% based on the original price, to 1.2 million yuan per dan, the interest of cocoon farmers has doubled. After collecting cocoons, they actively organized mulberry fields and carried out fertilization work. Currently, the amount of fresh cocoons collected in Jiangsu has reached 70,000 dan, and it is estimated that another 40,000 to 50,000 dan can be collected. The total amount of cocoons collected may reach 110,000 to 120,000 dan. Once the increased cocoon loan of 50 billion yuan is remitted, it can be fully collected. According to a senior official of the Four Joint Office, after inspecting various districts in Jiangsu, it is believed that in addition to the originally increased loan of 50 billion yuan, another 30 billion yuan is needed to meet the needs, and relevant parties are currently negotiating to apply for an increased loan. In terms of general quality, it has improved compared to last year. The work of drying cocoons in various firms is also stricter than last year. It is expected that the cocoons collected will be completely dried in another three to four days. The cocoon collection work in Zhejiang has come to an end, with more than 90,000 dan of fresh cocoons collected.

### 皖北開始收繭
### Cocoon Collection Begins in Northern Anhui

This spring, the sericulture industry in northern Anhui was guided by the China Silk Company, which distributed improved silkworm eggs. Cocoon collection has recently begun. To understand the actual situation, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Yin Liangying, the director of the secretariat of the company, who returned from an inspection in northern Anhui yesterday. According to him, the Anhui sericulture industry was said to be developed, and before the war, the sericulture industries of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui were mentioned in the same breath. During the war, it was severely damaged. Only northern Anhui retained cocoon drying equipment. Hao County has 12 sets of cocoon drying stoves, and this spring, 10,000 egg sheets were distributed. Bo County has 7 sets of cocoon drying stoves, and Taihe has 8 sets. Each distributed 6,000 egg sheets. The silkworms developed well and have already started cocooning. The best results were 40 jin of cocoons per egg sheet, and the average was about 8 jin per egg sheet. Cocoon collection points have been set up separately in the suburbs of Hao County, Junyang, Huamiao, and Taihe Shuipu, where the cocoon drying stoves are located. Bo County has collected more than 400 dan, Hao County more than 100 dan, and Taihe only more than 60 dan because the cocoon funds were robbed by bandits. All are still continuing to purchase. It is expected that the total amount of cocoons collected will be more than 1,000 dan. The highest price for improved cocoons is 7,500 yuan per jin. Northern Anhui has been flooded by the Yellow River for many years, and the people are poor. The cocoon farmers are all happy to receive benefits. Mr. Yin also said that this spring's pilot program in northern Anhui had too few silkworm eggs, and that nine out of ten mulberry leaves along the way were not used, which is a pity. If the sericulture industry is developed in Feidong, Fuyang, Taihe, Linquan, Mengcheng, Hao County, Woyang, and other counties, at least 100,000 egg sheets must be distributed. Moreover, northern Anhui is a continental plain with a dry climate and a dense population. The future of the sericulture industry is very promising.

### 產區存棉減少　各地棉價飛漲
### Cotton Stocks in Production Areas Decrease, Cotton Prices Soar Everywhere

According to textile industry news: Since this month, cotton stocks in various cotton production areas have been decreasing daily, and prices have continued to soar. According to statistics, the market price in Nanjing has increased by 253% compared to last month, making it one of the places with the highest price increase.

According to sources, the main reason for the increase in cotton prices is that a certain party is purchasing heavily in the production areas, leading to this situation.

### 本年浙茶滯銷　浙建廳正謀補救
### Zhejiang Tea Sales Stagnant This Year, Zhejiang Construction Department Seeks Remedies

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 8th] The tea production in Zhejiang Province this year has fallen into a difficult situation. More than 100 tea factories in the province have not yet started purchasing raw tea. According to estimates by the Construction Department, the tea production in various places this year is less than last year. The total amount of tea purchased for export is more than 60,000 dan, and the amount for domestic sales is 50,000 dan. The situation this year is dire, mainly due to the low price. Currently, the market price in Shanghai is between 400,000 and 500,000 yuan per zu of raw tea. However, the cost for tea farmers is also 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. As a result, tea merchants are reluctant to purchase, causing millions of tea farmers across the province to sigh at the state of the tea industry. The Construction Department has suggested to the central government that the government purchase tea at the actual cost, similar to the current method of purchasing silk, in order to provide relief.

### 高級香烟堅定
### High-End Cigarettes Remain Firm

Yesterday, the cigarette market situation was that Yongtaihe will distribute 50 packs of Qialike and 10 packs of Da Ying Lao Dao brand cigarettes. It was also heard that Sino-American Tobacco Company will distribute "Samsung and Black Label" two types today (9th), and the factory price is lower than the original, so the market is tired and cannot be revived, and the transactions in the market are also quiet. In the morning, ten packs of Da Ying opened at 6.1 million yuan, and once fell to 0.08 million yuan. Then there were scattered sales, and transactions occurred slightly at 120,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the market tightened slightly, and Da Ying cigarettes rose to 6.13 million yuan, a recovery of 20,000 yuan from Saturday. However, Lao Dao continued to fall by 130,000 yuan due to distribution. Throughout the day, the trend was that the high-end Da Nan Wei Da San Pao and the hot-selling stocks of the Shanghai merchant cigarettes remained firm. The remaining Meili Qianmen brand and American strip cigarettes mostly continued to weaken. As for the 50-pack listened cigarettes, there was no lack of absorption. San Wu brand Qialike sailors and others were all quite smart.

### 香港銀行家商討　防目僑匯逃港辦法
### Hong Kong Bankers Discuss Measures to Prevent Overseas Chinese Remittances from Fleeing to Hong Kong

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 8th] When bankers here informally discussed issues related to capital, especially overseas Chinese remittances fleeing to Hong Kong, they suggested abolishing the current official exchange rate. It is understood that Rogers, a British consultant to the Central Bank, has rejected this suggestion. Bankers here believe that the large difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate is the only factor causing overseas Chinese remittances to flee to Hong Kong. Because in Hong Kong, legal tender can be exchanged at black market prices, the black market price of US dollars here is about 35,000 yuan. The bankers believe that the only way to absorb overseas Chinese remittances is to adopt a free exchange rate determined by supply and demand. However, it is reported that Rogers said that he could not accept such opinions, because the official price could not be adjusted in the near future. He believed that adjusting foreign exchange at this time would affect the entire national economic policy. It is understood that the remittances from overseas Chinese in Malaya, the Philippines, Borneo, Siam, Annam, and other places are estimated to be at least 2 million Hong Kong dollars per month. It is not yet known what measures the Chinese government will take to address this serious situation. It is believed that the rumor that a financial institution has been established within the Hong Kong Central Bank seems to be the measure taken by the government.

### Rebuilding Shandong

— Dispatch from Jinan via Air, Three Days - From Our Special Correspondent, Li Tian

Following the assumption of command by Commander Wang Yaowu, who concurrently manages the administration of Shandong, a three-year governance program for Shandong province was drafted based on the principle of equal emphasis on politics and military affairs, under a unified military-political system. In January of this year, a pacification zone political affairs conference was convened, which adopted many practical and feasible resolutions, and formulated key points for Shandong Province's emergency coordination with military affairs. These three elements serve as the guiding principles for all administrative actions in Shandong Province. Although the rampant activities of the Communist forces and the fluctuating military situation have frequently increased difficulties in implementing the program over the past six months, Wang Yaowu has persevered in his determination to create a new Shandong.

Originally, the county grading system established by the central government based on population, taxation, etc., was no longer applicable under the current special circumstances in Shandong. To address reality, the Shandong Provincial Government decided to divide counties into the following five levels based on the degree to which government orders could be implemented: (1) Controlled Area, (2) Semi-Controlled Area, (3) Strongpoint Controlled Area, (4) Mobile Area, (5) Occupied Area. It was stipulated that Controlled Areas and Semi-Controlled Areas would have seven departments, Strongpoint Controlled Areas would have civil affairs and military affairs departments, and Mobile Areas and Occupied Areas would have no departments. This grading system could be changed at any time based on the degree to which government orders were implemented, in order to create a flexible system and reduce difficulties in manpower and resources.

Returning Refugees - Land to the Tiller

According to investigations, the number of refugees from Shandong who have fled to the areas controlled by provincial troops within the province is 7,857,000, while 1,813,000 are in the Nanjing and Xuzhou areas outside the province. The total number accounts for more than one-quarter of the province's total population. To address this, Wang Yaowu has requested and received 3 billion in relief funds from the central government for distribution and has arranged for the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) to allocate materials for distribution to various regions. He is also assisting in organizing self-aware, self-motivated, and self-governing homecoming corps, applying to the central government for agricultural loans, and requesting raw materials, fertilizers, small agricultural tools, and other production tools, funds, and weapons. With production tools, they can become self-reliant; with weapons, they can defend themselves. Such homecoming corps, possessing both production and self-defense organizations, can not only form a kind of mobile production group, gradually moving back to their hometowns, but can also, when necessary, still move out again in an armed and planned manner, avoiding sacrifices, until the area is stable before returning.

Returning to their hometowns, the people are absolutely prohibited from retaliating against those who remained behind when the Communist forces were in control. They are also implementing a substantial policy, expanding the unified construction movement. All land disputes will be resolved in accordance with central government laws, protecting tenant farmers, supporting owner-farmers, and earnestly implementing rent and interest reduction measures to realize land to the tiller. People's representative bodies at all levels below the county level will be established as soon as possible, and popular elections of township heads, chiefs, and county magistrates will be implemented step by step.

Guns Never Leave People - People Never Leave Their Homes

Regarding the rebuilding of local armed forces, it is necessary to specifically and particularly explain that in the early days of victory, Shandong Province, due to overly strict downsizing of local troops, overlooked the uniquely complex environment of Shandong. This inadvertently created an opportunity for the Communist forces. As a result, the government forces were cut back, the Communist forces expanded, and the central government troops, being too far away, could not provide timely assistance, leading to the current situation. Since assuming concurrent management of the province, Wang Yaowu has been steadily proceeding with the work of census taking, organizing baojia (collective responsibility system), and improving mass organizations in the recovered areas, especially in rebuilding local armed forces. In addition to reorganizing the provincial security regiments in accordance with central government regulations, self-defense forces will be established in the special commissioner areas according to actual needs. In the southwestern Shandong areas, the original large and small peasant associations will be organized into eight corps. In addition to police detachments, each county will have a self-defense battalion, each district a self-defense company, and each township a self-defense platoon. The organizational principles for each unit emphasize "guns never leave people, people never leave their homes, and non-separation from production" to strengthen the self-defense organization and training of counties, districts, townships, and baojia.

Increase Production - Stabilize Life

In terms of economic construction, in order to stabilize the people's lives, in addition to restoring farming, attention is also being paid to promoting special economic crops. Shandong's cotton production was second only to Shaanxi. This year, there was a plan to promote one million mu of cotton fields along the Jiaoji Railway and in southwestern Shandong, but it could not be fully completed due to military reasons. Regarding the plan to promote American tobacco varieties, the Provincial Department of Construction, Shandong University, and the North China Extension and Breeding Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry jointly established a breeding farm at the Chengyang Farm in Qingdao this year. Next year, it will be able to obtain enough American tobacco seeds to plant 50,000 mu. Other projects, such as straw braid, handmade cloth weaving, and the development of coal and iron production in Zaozhuang, Yixian, Laiwu, and Xintai, are also progressing steadily. In particular, Shandong Province has the largest reserve of gypsum in the country, accounting for the first place nationwide. As long as military operations progress, the future prospects are unlimited. In addition, utilizing relief materials for work-for-relief projects, carrying out the Grand Canal water conservancy irrigation project, and fully repairing highways and restoring transportation as military operations progress will closely coordinate with the needs of the National Army.

Consolidate Finances - Strictly Prohibit Apportionment

County-level finance is the key to relieving the people's suffering and competing with the Communist Party for the hearts of the people. If this point cannot be done well, or is not done well enough, all efforts will be in vain. Therefore, since Wang Yaowu assumed concurrent management of Shandong Province, he has determined the steps for clearing up finances based on the extent to which government orders are implemented in each county, approved expenses according to the new county-district grading system, and issued them on time without delay, sweeping away past malpractices to restore the provincial government's credibility. On the one hand, legal taxes are levied and tax sources are broadened; on the other hand, unified planning methods are used to implement reasonable burdens and thoroughly eliminate extra apportionment. Regarding the self-defense expenses of counties and cities, it is stipulated that the Unified Planning Committee will uniformly manage and disburse them. Although only four months have passed since its rigorous implementation, it has already achieved great results.

Over the years, after Shandong was split and divided by Communist Party occupation, the old social organization has completely disintegrated. Not only has politics disintegrated, but also the economy, society, and even culture have disintegrated. Since Wang Yaowu assumed concurrent management of Shandong Province, he has deeply understood that military affairs are only a temporary solution. The fundamental way to cure the problem lies in political construction and a highly developed political offensive, and the foundation of politics lies in the reconstruction of a new social organization. We have witnessed that the people of Shandong in the recovered areas have gradually been able to move from displacement to stability, from stability to progress, from being able to live to living a better life, and from being able to defend themselves to being able to govern themselves. Under the leadership of Wang Yaowu, overcoming all difficulties, they are gradually moving towards a new Shandong based on the Three Principles of the People: of the people, by the people, and for the people. This, on the other hand, also demonstrates that the Communist Party's policies of "liquidation," "struggle," and "overturning" are incompatible with the national character of the Chinese people and will inevitably encounter historically unavoidable failure.

### The Significance of the Qingdao Base

— Dispatch from Qingdao via Air, Fourth Day - From Our Special Correspondent, Shao Shenzhi

The Qingdao base holds inestimable significance for a strong navy.

The Chinese navy currently has more than 70,000 tons of ships. If distributed among the four planned naval bases in Qingdao, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Hainan Island, each base could berth less than 20,000 tons of ships. In the near future, more than 30,000 tons can be received from Japan. As for the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, its strength is uncertain. U.S. warships entering and leaving Qingdao naval port do not have procedures to notify the Chinese authorities. Generally speaking, Chinese officials in Qingdao are not clear about this matter.

In fact, the commander of the Chinese Qingdao base was only recently appointed, and Colonel Dong Muzeng has not yet taken office. The Northern Patrol Fleet of the Chinese fleet stationed in Qingdao receives oil from the U.S. military warehouses, with bills drawn and accounts kept, which the government will settle. A small ship of less than a thousand tons requires at least 1,500 gallons of diesel fuel for 24 hours of sailing (my estimate). Even when stationary, running a generator requires at least 100 gallons of diesel fuel per day. Supplying the navy is not the same as feeding an infant. Because essentially these ships are not built in Chinese shipyards, their situation is no different from that of the air force.

If the Qingdao base is viewed in isolation, it possesses the elements of a good port. There is heavy fog in May, June, and July, most severely in July, like London, where it is impossible to see even a short distance. However, it dissipates before 8:00 AM and is not so serious as to require daytime lighting for vehicles. Under current military equipment conditions, it will not be a problem. Military experts worldwide consider it to be one of the world's foremost naval ports. Its transition from German to Japanese to the current situation may serve as one of the examples for geopolitics scholars.

Two Powers Confront - Broad Implications

If viewed in conjunction with other factors, the problem is undoubtedly complex, but the true value can be revealed. It and Lushun/Dalian are separated by the Shandong Peninsula and the Bohai Sea Bay, facing each other from afar. The range of fighter jets is less than one hour. The Shandong Peninsula is under the control of the Communist armed forces, while the Liaodong Peninsula is in a state of intertwined control by the Nationalists and Communists. Coupled with the presence of Soviet and American forces, there is a hidden confrontation between two different forces in the world. The phenomena occurring around the Bohai Sea, between 35 and 40 degrees north latitude, are of serious concern to China and the world. The issues that arise are enough to stimulate China and the world because they are too concrete and extensive.

Connected to Sasebo in a Line

Qingdao and Sasebo can be connected in a line, forming a triangular zone with Shanghai on the Yellow Sea. The entire Yellow Sea is within the 12-hour sailing range of cruisers. This is like a tight net that holds the entire Yellow Sea. But Qingdao is a hub. Without the Qingdao base, Shanghai could be connected to Sasebo in a line, which would be equivalent to completely withdrawing from the Yellow Sea. Therefore, Qingdao has become a symbol of the Yellow Sea.

American Advisors - Not Paid Salaries

The United States "established a base in Qingdao to train the Chinese Navy." There are 70 American advisors at the naval academy. The Chinese government does not pay their salaries. They specialize in training the Chinese Navy to receive American ships. Colonel Wei Jimin, the director of education, said that there is a lot of American teaching equipment, and just the installation alone puts a great strain on our finances. The training level is generally based on being able to completely control the ships as a preliminary standard. The Chinese Navy is receiving warships from the Americans, but there is "no fixed curriculum." Students at the naval academy in Shanghai are still arriving in Qingdao. It is expected that all 158 students will arrive by the middle of this month. Twelve ships are waiting to be delivered to the Chinese Navy. In the past, Qingdao has received 36 ships, while Shanghai has received 50 ships. Including the 12 ships, the total number is still less than 100, totaling about 70,000 tons. The pre-war figure of more than 100,000 tons for the Chinese Navy must be supplemented by receiving more than 30,000 tons of Japanese ships. Only then can it be called "restoration" of the naval numbers.

Russian-Speaking Residents - Continue to Increase

Through TASS reports, the Soviet Union is showing serious attention to Qingdao. On the other hand, among the foreigners in Qingdao, the largest number is Soviet and quasi-Soviet (White Russians, who can become Soviet citizens at any time). There are about more than 1,000 people. They are almost equal to the total number of foreigners of 38 other nationalities (including Jews). They increase with the increase in the U.S. Marines. The occupations they hold are the same as those in general capitalist countries. Although there is a serious "housing shortage" in Qingdao, the number of Russian-speaking friends continues to increase.

Radar Emissions - Military Depots Rumble

From the seaside docks, radar emitters on several large buildings can be seen rotating in the sky from afar. U.S. military vehicles rumble incessantly on the roads, while the latest model sedans are mostly owned by Chinese. At the Qingdao City Council, a councilor questioned the mayor, saying, "The U.S. military has been stationed in Qingdao for a year and eight months, but more than 400 citizens have died at the hands of U.S. soldiers or under their vehicles. I hope the city government can find a solution." The mayor said, "There have been more than 200 cases of U.S. military personnel injuring people. Every case has been negotiated, and more than two-thirds have been resolved, while one-third is still under investigation." The questioning took place when Shandong University on Daxue Road was in a mess. This day was "June 2nd." This day was a full-blown fight.

Swimming Beaches - Scheduled to Open

Qingdao has wind blowing every day, shaking the windows, as if foreshadowing what might happen. U.S. sailors walk on the streets, and Chinese naval personnel also walk on the streets, especially whole teams of naval students, dressed so neatly, with the vast and beautiful sea as their background, giving one a sense of inexplicable excitement, and also a feeling of the significance of Qingdao.

High summer is coming, and every small contact on the periphery can be thrilling, but this year's swimming beaches are still as beautiful as ever. The painted bathing sheds, competing for novelty and ingenuity, require much effort. They are scheduled to open formally on the 15th, and I will have the opportunity to describe them to readers. We have such good bathing beaches, we can really be proud.

### The Temple of Confucius - The Confucian Forest

— Quick Dispatch from Qufu, One Day

The current county town of Qufu was once the capital of the Lu state in ancient times, and also the hometown of sages and virtuous men. Every year during the spring and autumn seasons, the number of visitors is very large. Recently, with the restoration of railway transportation, there has been a gradual stream of visitors.

The name "Qufu" comes from the mound (fu) to the west of Fangshan Mountain in the east of the city, which meanders for seven or eight li.

The Temple of Confucius is located in the city, slightly west of Confucius' old residence. Its main hall, the Dacheng Hall, has nine rooms, is seven zhang eight chi six cun high, fourteen zhang two chi seven cun wide, and eight zhang four chi deep. The front pillars, to the right, are all coiled dragons. Beside and behind the eaves are stone pillars engraved with flowers, and the tiles are covered with yellow. In front is a platform, surrounded by stone railings, with two levels, and twelve steps on the middle steps and on the left and right. (See Figures 1 to 4 for a panoramic view of the Temple of Confucius.)

The Confucian Forest is located three li north of the county town, facing the Zhu River and backing the Si River. The Historical Records says: Confucius was buried north of the city of Lu, on the banks of the Si River. The tomb is like a horse's back, one zhang five chi high, and ten steps wide from north to south. There are two stone tablets in front of the tomb: one is the old tablet from the Xuanhe year of the Song Dynasty, and the other was erected by Yan Sheng Gong Chan Jin during the Zhengtong period of the Ming Dynasty. To its southwest is a three-room chamber, the burial place of Zigong. (See the panoramic view of the Confucian Forest above and below.)

Ancient cypress trees stand densely and solemnly beside it. At first, the forest was only one qing, and then it was expanded to twenty-nine qing, then to forty mu and nine fen. The circumference is more than ten li. Since Confucius, all members of the Kong family have been buried outside the walls of the saint's tomb, within the walls of the forest. This is what the ancients called family burial. (Special correspondent Zhang Yunzhi photographed and wrote this report.)

### Response to the Export of Taiwan Tea

— Dispatch from Taipei via Air, Second Day - Our Correspondent, Yang Yu

Among the cultivated land in Taiwan, the area for tea production ranks fourth, only after rice, sweet potatoes, and sugarcane. For more than 50 years during the Japanese occupation, the rise and fall of Taiwan tea had a closely related impact on the entire economy of Taiwan Province. During the peak period of Taiwan tea, the cultivated area was nearly 700,000 mu, and the output of refined tea was about 26 million catties. This was the result of the Japanese replacing manual labor with machines in a colonial manner for more than 20 years after occupying Taiwan. They actively exported and expanded foreign trade. At that time, in the world market, it was sufficient to compete with China and India. The hard work and sweat of the compatriots were exchanged for considerable profits for the Japanese. Until after the Pacific War, the U.S. sales of Taiwan tea were completely cut off. In the years 1944 and 1945, Taiwan tea suffered an unprecedented disaster. Tea factories stopped work, tea gardens were deserted, and tea farmers were unemployed. Now, when we talk about revival, it is truly an arduous task to revive everything from scratch.

If tea farmers have profits, manufacturers must also be guaranteed. Therefore, the Bank of Taiwan has now undertaken tea factory loans, with tea companies receiving 300 million yuan and private tea factories receiving 200 million yuan. With sufficient capital turnover, production will not be hindered. Last year, the total output of refined tea in the province was only 6 million pounds. This year, it is expected to reach 13 million pounds. If everything goes smoothly next year, it will not be difficult to match the pre-war annual output of more than 20 million pounds. The company itself can produce more than 4 million pounds of refined tea this year, accounting for one-third of the total output. One million pounds of raw materials are taken from its own tea gardens, and the remaining must be purchased from private tea gardens. The company plans to further establish tea farmer cooperatives and encourage tea factory production in the future. After the establishment of the Agricultural and Forestry Enterprise Co., Ltd., the tea company also launched the work of raising private shares and preferred shares. This is not competing with the people for profit, but rather sharing profits with the people. The company's income is the government's income, and this income is still invested in the tea industry. To ensure that Taiwan tea has a future, there must be no barriers in between. Only through everyone's cooperation, and with the company not regarding private workshops as competitors, but mainly striving for the international market to earn foreign exchange for the country. When the reporter asked Mr. Tao, the Chief of General Affairs of the former Tea Bureau Company, about the export situation of Taiwan tea, he told me quite frankly that only Formosa Oolong tea can show off a bit in the American market. Although the profit margin is small, it must be maintained in any case; otherwise, if Americans forget the taste of Formosa Oolong tea, it will be difficult to open the market again. The Taiwan tea export began with a batch of 400,000 pounds sold to the New York branch of the China Trust Company at the end of last year. It was not until May of this year that more than 180,000 U.S. dollars of foreign exchange was settled at the official price of 11.85 yuan, at a rate of 45 cents per pound. The response was: the size of the samples matched; there were no impurities; and the aroma was standard enough. Therefore, another batch of 7,000 boxes was shipped to the American branch of the Bank of China yesterday. The China Trust Company has announced a price of 44 cents per pound, but hopes that someone will offer a higher price.

Looking at the tea company's accounts from last year, it seems that some money was made by selling the accumulated raw materials at market prices, but it is not so simple to replenish them. Therefore, maintaining quality, grasping sales channels, and opening up markets are important, and the tea company becomes a pioneer. It is said that many tea merchants can deceive the inspectors and mix old tea for re-processing and export. The impact of this is unthinkable. When the harm is felt, the entire Taiwan tea industry will collapse. The reporter often hears the call to "take a long-term view and act with conscience." Thinking of the future of Taiwan tea, this call is loud enough to be deafening and shocking!

Currently, the tea company is seeking solutions to the following difficulties: (1) the restoration of tea gardens, (2) the impact of commodity prices on production costs, (3) the replenishment of materials, (4) the instability of tea farmers' lives, and (5) the inability of Taiwanese compatriots to understand the government's tea industry policy. These problems are mostly related and interdependent. Therefore, to prevent the shakeup of the entire Taiwan tea enterprise, from production in the tea garden to loading for export, there needs to be a comprehensive plan that takes care of everything from start to finish, and a definite and unwavering fixed direction. The tea company has unlimited optimism about this.

### On the Right Path to Nation-Building

— Zhou

Currently, the aspiration of the people throughout the country lies in seeking domestic peace, political democracy, and economic construction. This is to implement the Three Principles of the People as the "constant path to saving and building the nation." If domestic peace is absent and wars continue endlessly, internal strife will inevitably invite external aggression. As a result, the final victory obtained through eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, at the cost of the lives and property of tens of millions of compatriots, and the glory of being ranked among the five great powers, is now almost subject to the humiliating disgrace of being discussed as a problem at the Moscow Conference of Foreign Ministers due to years of war and the disappointment of peace! If various parties, factions, and people throughout the country do not prioritize the nation and its people above all else and quickly follow the path of peaceful nation-building to resolve their own problems, they will inevitably plunge the nation and its people into an irredeemable abyss, becoming the subject of international conferences for discussion and disposition. The blood of revolutionary martyrs and those who fought in the War of Resistance will be shed in vain, and the nation's independence and people's freedom will inevitably be lost again! Therefore, at the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Central Committee, President Chiang Kai-shek earnestly encouraged everyone to "gather patriotic and ambitious individuals from across the country to fight together," and instructed, "On the eve of the implementation of constitutional governance, we should cultivate the magnanimity of our party members and interact sincerely with other parties." If we can follow President Chiang's instructions, sincerely cooperate with other parties, work together harmoniously, tolerate each other for the sake of the country, and embark on the path of peaceful nation-building to eliminate international interference, strive for national freedom, and realize the ideals of nationalism, this is the primary task of revolutionary nation-building today, which should be carefully considered and rationally resolved.

The Kuomintang is the oldest and largest party in Chinese history, and it is undeniable that there are many shortcomings and inertia within the party. Since the Kuomintang came to power, many party members have been able to be public-spirited and law-abiding, working for the country and the people. However, there are also many selfish and self-serving corrupt officials who rely on their party membership to engage in corruption and seek promotion and wealth. Once officials become corrupt, politics become inefficient and ineffective. Therefore, to improve political efficiency, corruption must be eradicated; to eradicate corruption, governments at all levels must make economic, administrative, and personnel matters public. Governments in all democratic countries have an obligation to publish financial budgets and final accounts to the public. Not only should financial figures be published, but other figures should also be published as much as possible. Not only should figures be published, but all economic measures should also be easily understood by the people and should not contain elements of concealment or even deception. Before any administrative measures are decided, they should always be publicly announced and even widely publicized to allow the people to understand the true situation. The promotion and demotion of government officials should be fair and selfless, prioritizing the country over the party, selecting the virtuous and capable, conducting regular assessments, and publicly rewarding and punishing them. Only by making everything public can we achieve impartiality, eradicate corrupt officials, build a clean and efficient government, increase administrative efficiency, implement all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and move towards the path of democratic constitutionalism. Democratic countries emphasize protecting the rights of the people, so it is necessary to ensure the freedom of the people in terms of body, thought, religion, belief, speech, publication, assembly, association, residence, movement, and communication. Existing laws and regulations that conflict with the above principles should be amended or repealed accordingly. In particular, it is necessary to strictly prohibit any agency or individual other than judicial and police organs from engaging in the arrest, interrogation, and punishment of the people. Democratic politics is a politics that reflects public opinion, promotes the rule of law, and implements governance by the people. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and universally establish provincial, county (city) councils, and public opinion organs below the county level to express public opinion, ensure the unity and independence of judicial power, free from political interference, strengthen court personnel, improve their treatment and status, uphold their sacred duty of enforcing the law impartially, and promote the supervisory system to severely punish corruption, so that the whole country follows the law, and to promote the rule of law; actively promote the new county system, complete local autonomy, and realize governance by the people. From now on, Kuomintang members should particularly respect public opinion, abide by laws and regulations, promote autonomy, and move towards the path of democratic constitutionalism. Young party members with ambition, talent, and integrity should go deep into the grassroots, become sound rural autonomous officials or rural elementary school teachers, faithfully serve the people, and cultivate healthy seedlings for the nation. It would be even better if they could go deep into the border areas, become border reclamation members, and devote themselves to border construction to consolidate national defense. These are all new trends and styles that the party headquarters and party members should adopt at present. As for improving the composition and quality of party members, we should focus on the education of party members and the cultivation of a spirit of self-examination, self-criticism, and self-improvement. The goal is to continuously improve the standards of health, morality, knowledge, and ability, and to enhance the spirit of service to build the country and create happiness for the people. To train the people to exercise their four powers, to instill political common sense in the people, so that the people of the whole country can truly use their own strength to manage their own affairs, to achieve true "returning power to the people," and to embark on the bright path of true democratic constitutionalism, and to realize the ideals of civil rights, is the constant path that should be followed in saving and building the nation today.

Today, the people are suffering from poverty and disease, and their lives are unbearable. Therefore, to carry out revolutionary nation-building, we must earnestly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, improve the people's lives, pay attention to the problem of nourishing the people, and seek sufficient food and clothing to enrich the people and the country. The method of implementation should follow the "Industrial Plan," formulate an economic construction plan, welcome international capital and technological cooperation, and prioritize both industry and mining, and agriculture and commerce. To promote China's industrialization, the government should convene a national economic conference on a regular basis, inviting people from all sectors of society related to the development of economic construction to absorb public opinions and decide on government measures. Large-scale industries that are monopolistic and cannot be run by private capital should be classified as state-owned or publicly owned, such as railways, machinery manufacturing plants, and electrical undertakings, which should be run by the government. Other smaller-scale industries should be given incentives by formulating incentive regulations and be subject to government guidance and supervision to achieve the goal of regulating capital. Similarly, for the exploitation of mineral products, in addition to a part stipulated to be operated by the state, we should also vigorously encourage private exploitation, because more mining means more power for nation-building. In this way, while exploiting mineral resources and establishing the foundation of heavy industry, and encouraging the operation of light industry, we must also develop and improve local handicrafts. As for the types of handicraft products, we must select those with huge needs and first try to rush production. The government should pay special attention to supporting this type of industry and promoting its success, so that it can be self-sufficient. If there are still some domestic raw materials that are not available, we can conduct research to imitate or use other similar substitutes, so as to minimize the use of foreign goods as the first priority. For large machines and industrial supplies, except for those that China cannot currently manufacture by itself, which can be purchased abroad, ordinary parts can be manufactured by ourselves. The general principle is to create by self-reliance and use domestic products as much as possible, so as to develop resources, reduce imports, and balance foreign exchange. In addition, attention should be paid to the suitability of transportation and geographical environment in the selection of industrial locations, because if transportation is inconvenient and transportation is blocked, it will prevent the balance of supply and demand, and it will also be uneconomical in terms of time and economy. Other measures include the implementation of labor laws, the improvement of working conditions, the trial implementation of the labor dividend system, the establishment of unemployment insurance and disability insurance for workers, the effective protection of child labor and female labor, the formulation of industrial association laws to enable industrial operators to have separate organizations, and the improvement of factory management regulations to promote labor-management cooperation. Widely establish workers' night schools, technical schools, and industrial and mining research institutions to improve workers' cultural standards and promote industrial and mining construction. Encourage scientific research and invention, and catch up with the material civilization of Europe and the United States. These are all necessary measures to promote national industrialization. As for agriculture, it is necessary to implement rent reduction and interest reduction, protect tenant rights, guarantee rent payment, expand agricultural loans, strictly prohibit usury exploitation to improve the lives of farmers, and implement land law to achieve the goal of "farmers have their own land." We should also reclaim national wasteland, develop farmland water conservancy, develop farmers' organizations, promote collective farms, implement a warehousing system, establish agricultural financial institutions, encourage rural cooperative undertakings, pay attention to scientific experiments, promote agricultural extension, and engage in agricultural product processing to promote the industrialization of agriculture. The export of agricultural products in our country is mainly tea, silk, tung oil, etc., so tea leaves, silkworm seeds, and tung seedlings must be improved in quality to meet inspection standards, so that international trade can flourish and exchange for a large amount of foreign exchange. Other measures include consolidating the legal currency, stabilizing prices, reforming the tax system, eradicating excessive taxes and illegal apportionments, merging collection agencies, simplifying audit procedures, determining progressive tax rates based on assets and income, promoting specialized methods of national banks, supporting the development of industrial and agricultural undertakings, implementing protective tariff policies, and managing the import and export of goods. Promoting our country's international trade, raising funds for the demobilization and employment of soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance, guaranteeing the lives of disabled veterans, providing pensions and education for the families of soldiers who died in the War of Resistance, confiscating all enemy and puppet property in the recovered areas, providing relief to displaced refugees and overseas Chinese, and assisting their repatriation and resumption of business are all urgent economic priorities, and are the constant path to saving the poor and becoming rich, implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood, and saving and building the nation.

The health of the people is the driving force for saving and building the nation, and it is the most valuable resource of the nation and the people. Therefore, Americans regard health as the first thing to do to love the country, and the British also have the saying that "a nation with third-class physique cannot create a first-class country." Westerners often regard health as wealth, and the Soviet Union's revolutionary nation-building, which especially emphasizes hygiene and strives to strengthen the people, is the most recent and best example for reference. Therefore, to build a rich, strong, healthy and happy new China, we must strive to strengthen the people and strengthen the species. To strengthen the people and strengthen the species, we must also pay attention to the "education" and "happiness" of the people. This is why the Principle of People's Livelihood, in addition to discussing the four major issues of food, clothing, housing and transportation, also has the two major issues of "education" and "happiness." Although these two issues have not been discussed in the Principle of People's Livelihood, according to the author's humble opinion, the meaning of "education" is to ensure that the people of the whole country have full development in both body and mind, and special attention should be paid to the two causes of "hygiene" and "education."

In terms of hygiene, it is necessary to popularize medical and health facilities, such as the widespread establishment of various specialized hospitals, provincial, municipal, and county hospitals, health centers, health branches, health stations, health workers, etc., as well as the large-scale establishment of various health institutions such as hygiene materials factories, pharmaceutical factories, blood serum vaccine factories, hygiene experiment institutes, and hygiene training institutes, to complete the construction of a hygiene network, and implement public medicine and public drugs, so that the whole people can receive free medical treatment to promote national health. However, medical and health care is only for treating and preventing diseases, while exercise is for strengthening the body and removing diseases. Therefore, if we want to promote national health, we must popularize national fitness exercises, such as widely organizing sports groups, widely establishing sports venues and enriching their equipment, and encouraging various sports competitions.

We should also spread the exercise methods suitable for each person's body, so as to increase the interest of the whole people in sports and promote their health. However, some people, because their parents and ancestors have hereditary diseases, may get this hereditary disease during pregnancy or after childbirth. If we want to reduce them, or even eliminate them completely, then we must implement the national eugenics policy. The method should be that the government should set up marriage authorities, promulgate various laws and regulations to encourage the reproduction of superior species, and stipulate that both parties to the marriage must exchange health certificates to encourage the reproduction of superior species and prevent the inheritance of inferior species. However, healthy children who are born will definitely become unhealthy after a while if they do not have good living habits and exercise methods, so we must actively promote health education, such as instilling health knowledge, training hygiene habits, managing the hygiene environment, implementing school hygiene, and paying attention to mental health. The health of a person! Whether innate or acquired, is closely related to the family, because the family is the place to raise children and educate children, and it is also the cell of the social country, so we must improve the family to build a sound society, such as implementing maternal and child hygiene, and improving family environmental hygiene and food, clothing, housing management, etc. Various places should also widely establish nurseries, kindergartens, youth and infant hospitals, and children's welfare homes to implement children's welfare and education. And enable working women to foster their children when they work, so as to reduce their responsibility for raising children and increase their effectiveness in serving the community. These are all constant paths that should be followed in protecting healthy children and people.

Spring and Autumn

### The Life and Death of Yu Dafu

— Mengnong

The weather is undergoing drastic changes. This really doesn't seem like early summer. As evening approaches, a musty air appears. Outside the window, the lush green but slightly yellowed elm leaves fall from time to time with the wind, making a rustling, monotonous sound. I silently closed the "Complete Works of Yu Dafu" in my hand, and in a dreamlike state, I silently reminisced about this respectable and mournful literary giant!

Yu Dafu's life is over. He was tragically murdered in the autumn wind of August two years ago, just like the elm leaves falling in the torrential rain outside the window, and it seemed that he didn't even make a rustling, weak cry! Andreyev said: "People who come from the darkness and return to the darkness are sucked into the infinite void of time, and no trace remains." Could he have become one of the people Andreyev referred to as "no trace remains"? Perhaps this is the common fate of literary figures of that era.

Yu Dafu's life is a great tragedy, and also an epic of heroism. His works, his art—art that entrusted his own life, are unfolding before my eyes, giving me encouragement, giving any young person new inspiration. Therefore, I can better understand the true meaning of Andreyev's warning-like maxim, because I really can't help but sigh and grieve for those people who are submerged by time. Perhaps they had valuable thoughts and feelings, but unfortunately they all disappeared from the ticking of time, and fell like elm leaves in iron rain without a trace. They could not or were unwilling to leave any traces.

Fortunately, Yu Dafu, in his thirties, compiled his own "Complete Works," collecting his main works before the age of thirty. He didn't seem to value the past very much, but he didn't deny it either. He called his entire works "cold ashes," "worn-out shoes," "chicken ribs," "broken remnants," and "fern vegetables." At the same time, he lamented the present and forever placed his hopes on the future.

His past was an endless wandering. In the second year of the Xuantong reign, he wandered from his hometown of Fuyang to Hangzhou, where he studied at the First Middle School. He always went to Meihua Stele, where there were many local bookstores, to take a walk. At that time, he loved to read the two books "Tales of West Lake" and "Traces of Flowers and the Moon." Two years later, the revolutionary army rose up, and the provincial schools were suspended due to the current situation. He changed to a church school, but he still loved to read the talented scholars and beautiful women's dramas "The Peach Blossom Fan" and "The Swallow Letter." That year he was only seventeen years old. In September, he went to Japan and worked hard. The next spring, he entered Tokyo High School. From then on, he came into contact with Western masterpieces. From Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gorky, Chekhov, to writers from Germany, England, Japan, and France. According to him, he read about 1,000 masterpieces in four years. Later, he entered the Department of Economics at Tokyo Imperial University, but he still loved literature. This is how his creative life unfolded—his first work, "Sinking," expressed a romance of his study abroad days. Later, although on the one hand he was criticized as "garbage" and "wounds," on the other hand he was loved by readers.

He returned to China in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, but he could not find a job. He began to write novels and joined the Creation Society. The following year, he was hired by Peking University as a professor. In the twenty-fourth year, he was a professor at Wuchang University, and a year later he returned to Shanghai. Since then, he went south to Guangzhou and north to Jinghua, and his journey was hurried, with almost no peaceful days. Although he had published some works in the meantime, he himself said that "he had never sat down to do great things."

His years entered China in wandering uncertainty. He hoped to end his past unstable life. He had longed for the pleasure of indifference and tranquility many times: "I don't need brocade clothes, and I'm content with wild vegetables, but the house to live in, the car to travel in, or at least a pair of shoes and socks, must be there before I can speak." ("Notes on the Thatched Cottage in the Wind and Rain") He also said: "My nature of traveling and liking to stay overnight has gradually decreased in recent years;" he "only wants to not change his usual state, eat some exquisite dishes at home, drink some fragrant wine, take a nap, and read some leisurely books, and is unwilling to move his actions and peacetime - in short, he is too lazy to move."

When the War of Resistance broke out, his life not only could not be as stable as he had hoped, but became even more bumpy. He detoured into Fujian and served as an official for a period of time, and then went to Nanyang to run a newspaper. When the Pacific War broke out, he left Singapore in February of the following year and fled to Selat Panjang, Pengkalan Island, on Sumatra Island. He changed his name to "Zhang Deqing" and made a living by doing small business. The violence and terror of the Japanese soldiers became more and more intense every day, so he decided to escape to the western part of Sumatra Island - Paya Kumbuh. At this time, he used the alias "Zhao Lian" and in September of the thirty-first year, he raised a little capital and opened the "Zhao Lian Winery." The purpose was to use this as a cover and solve the lives of some poor friends who were fleeing. But this way of life could not be concealed from the Japanese for long. The Japanese military police may have already known that he was Yu Dafu, and using the excuse that this "Zhao Lian" could speak fluent Japanese, they ostensibly asked him to be an interpreter for the military police department, but in reality, they placed him under house arrest and surveillance. He was forced to serve as an interpreter. Although he was unwilling, he had no choice. It was not until February of the following year that he resigned from the position of interpreter for the military police department, claiming to be ill (lung disease). During this period, he did help a lot in rescuing overseas Chinese.

After the Japanese surrendered, Yu Dafu encountered an even more unfortunate accident. I don't know if this was his misfortune or his good fortune. On August 29 (the Central News Agency telegram said August 28, but it is not known which is correct), he was suddenly arrested by the Japanese army and "executed by shooting at the same time as several Europeans. His tomb is located seven kilometers from the Fort de Kock." Indeed, Yu Dafu knew the atrocities, secrets and intelligence of the Japanese army well in Sumatra for four years. How could the Japanese army let him go? If they left him, wouldn't they be leaving a living witness? Yu Dafu's tragic death was of course inevitable. Yu Dafu may not have been unaware of this conspiracy of the Japanese. But at the same time, he also knew the way to give up his life for righteousness. Where righteousness lies, death is not a resignation. This death at least proves that he is not drifting along with a group of vulgar people, but on the contrary, it shows that he is after all "a modern Lu You who is full of vicissitudes and cares about his family and country!"

The story has to be told again: If he had not been sacrificed under the iron hooves of the Japanese army, he would only be fifty years old this year. He would definitely be able to gather his remaining courage and write a powerful work or even many powerful works to strongly accuse the Japanese army. However, now, what else can be left besides this "Complete Works of Yu Dafu" that he wrote early in his life as a will? No, no, a thousand no's! Thinking like this, his complete works are his monument. At least in my opinion, it is worth remembering, worth stroking, and worth embracing!

The closed "Complete Works of Yu Dafu" was finally opened again. The elm leaves outside the window are still fluttering in the wind and rain. Accompanying it is the ticking of the clock on the wall.

It was ticking like this in the past, it is ticking like this now, and it will still be ticking like this in the future. Some writers have disappeared, some writers have emerged, and Yu Dafu is immortal. He was brave and intelligent. He used his life and career to fill this short, gloomy, and empty time. He chose the path of self-sacrifice. He has completed the tortuous and varied path of a writer. Rest in peace, farewell, our poet and novelist!

Mr. Yu Dafu has already established an undeniable achievement in the Chinese New Culture Movement. In terms of novella and short story creation, Mr. Yu Dafu has also given us many new forms and techniques. He has the demeanor of an Eastern literary figure, the passion of a Western writer, chic and melancholy, respectable and lovely. This year is the third anniversary of his death and the fiftieth anniversary of his birth (his birthday is the fourth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar). This journal is now able to publish Mr. Menglong's introduction to his life and death. In the future, on the anniversary of his birth, we can also ask several friends who know Yu Dafu well to write a few more articles. (Editor)

### Ten Years

— Cheng Tixuan

Ten years have passed in the central government, it seems like a moment. The capital city is contained in my heart, my sleeves are still as clean as the wind. By the Lion Bridge, I watch the moon above the tall buildings; by the Jiming Dike, I relive the spring in the small courtyard. I am still me, I still have my writing to serve the country; thirty or forty years old, please remember my youth. To show my relatives and friends, and to express my feelings of separation and reunion.

I have been entrusted with the important task of the central government for ten years, my official post is pure, and my hair has turned grey (Pan Yue was thirty-two years old when he first saw grey hair, and I am now four years older than him as a Yellow Gate official). Good news is waiting to be spread like the warbler singing from the valley, and the new residence is comparable to the phoenix moving its nest. I want to see the Stone Chamber and the Orchid Terrace, still the lofty palace of jade. It is still difficult to forget the country, when will I dream of county sabers on the roof beam?

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 529

— Ye Jingfeng

"Are their two 'telegrams' the same?" I felt very interested.

"That's what's truly strange! ... After we carefully compared the two 'spiritual messages,' only the order of the items was different. The content was practically identical... That wouldn't be so special, but that old man, Juechang, in addition to noting the spiritual message, also attached two sentences. Looking at those two sentences, I was utterly shocked from my toes to the top of my head: it turned out that the old man even knew the results of our discussions here in advance! So the old man said, 'Elder Aoki's plan is not much different from the method you proposed, so you can proceed with confidence...' Isn't this a heap of strange things?..." (Tsurumi)

"I don't think it's strange at all!" I told Tsurumi, looking at his bewildered face.

"What?" Tsurumi asked, eyes wide.

"I ask you, do you know why Elder Aoki insisted that Heizi invite you to Shanghai?"

"That's because Heizi can't handle the work of breaking the 'Secret of Eight,' only I can..."

"Here we go again!"

"I don't understand the meaning of what you're saying."

"It's very simple... Didn't you just say that the most important thing in Elder Aoki's 'spiritual message' was the 'numerical factor,' that he calculated that the date of August 1st was very auspicious for Japan's dispatch of troops? The Japanese, especially those military leaders, are extremely superstitious. Before planning to invade the mainland, they must have had astrologers calculate it; Elder Aoki wouldn't calculate it himself, but of course he would have news. So, he figured that only you could use your direct reports to Konoe about the news unfavorable to the Japanese dispatch of troops to prevent the launch of the 'Secret of Eight.' At least you could disturb them and miss the auspicious day they calculated..."

"Brother, the more you say, the more confused I become. Do you mean to say that Elder Aoki had already planned everything in advance, so this 'Secret of Eight' must have been broken in order to succeed?"

"That's right!"

"Brother, you're talking nonsense... I won't argue about anything else, just one thing. Elder Aoki, even if he had arranged everything properly, waiting for Heizi to invite me to carry it out. But I have to ask, such telegram reports, I could do them anywhere. Let's say those telegrams had to be sent from Shanghai and Nanjing. Zheng Yan in Shanghai and Tian Yiichi in Nanjing could also do it, as long as I sent a few more telegrams, right?"

"Do you think you're the only one who's awake in the world, and everyone else is a blockhead?" I explained, "Your actions, Heizi's actions, everything, Konoe is probably getting detailed reports. Elder Aoki has a detailed ledger of the mutual attacks of the three Mei, Lan, and Song special agent groups, your jealousy and my envy; then, he must have predicted that something would happen when you and Heizi came to Shanghai. Do you know that this time they troubled Heizi, they also wanted to catch you in the net, only because you and Heizi didn't understand the meaning of '0915,' that's why you luckily escaped the net—furthermore. Elder Aoki probably determined that something would happen as soon as you two arrived in Shanghai, and the occurrence of this incident itself could prove the internal discord of the Japanese army; just this kind of news of internal discord, once it reaches Konoe's ears, wouldn't it lightly warn him against rash action?..."

### Children's Drawings

— Ji Guoping

The issue of children's drawings has gradually attracted the attention of the general public, especially those responsible for education, with the development of art education. Many scholars in foreign countries have done such research work, such as Legrange in France, Kerstienssteiner in Germany, and Kamezaburo Hino in Japan, all of whom have detailed studies. Schestel of Austria even organized a world-renowned children's art class to study children's drawing.

Children are happy and lively, and their love of art can be said to be an innate instinct. Therefore, when we see a child holding a pen to draw, they are always focused and concentrated, full of strong interest. But in fact, children's drawings are incomplete, disproportionate, unorganized, and uninformative. We cannot observe and criticize them with adult eyes. We need to know that children's drawings have their own realm, their own feelings, and their own views.

Children's drawings are sometimes intentional and sometimes unintentional. Because all healthy children like to scribble, chalk, charcoal, bricks, and tiles are their tools; the ground, walls, paper, and books are all places for them to express themselves. This is a kind of muscle movement and a pure expression of inner movement, which is never subject to any restraint or coercion, as if expressing themselves in words. The purpose of drawing is completely disregarded.

Generally, in the early stages of children's drawing, it is always out of imitative impulses. For example, when they see someone writing or drawing, they will definitely take a pen and scribble randomly. This is completely an imitative action; in addition to imitative actions, because of close association and similar association, drawing a horse leads to drawing a cow, and drawing a fish leads to drawing a shrimp. What's more, due to mechanical movements, drawing a circle leads to drawing many circles, drawing a line leads to drawing many lines; because of this, they can express many things by scribbling at will.

Children have the habit of preserving past impressions, that is, they like to draw things they have drawn before. Once they have drawn something, that impression is firmly remembered and does not change easily. For example, when drawing a landscape with two peaks and a sun in the middle, they will still draw the peaks and the sun unchanged when drawing a landscape after a long time. Their preservation of past impressions is an unconscious revelation, so we can know that they have a "internal impression" before drawing, so what they depict is a reproduction of external things that has been organized by their "internal impression".

Children's selection of drawing materials is also different from that of adults. For example, when drawing a house, they draw the upper half of the house, but not the lower half; when drawing a person, they draw the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth all at once, regardless of distance or size. This is a expression of what they consider important and what they consider unimportant, or what they consider cute and what they consider unlovely.

Therefore, children's drawings are a accumulation of many impressions of external objects and various internal activities, forming another kind of impression, a unique form of children's drawing.

### Casual Talks on Poetry

— Kengqiang

Poetry is the lighthouse on the coast, it guides ships lost in the vast ocean, sailing into the bright and happy harbor.

Poetry is the kite in the sky, it can lead people's hopes to fly everywhere.

### Life Without Laughter

— Zhang Mingchun

As the beautiful sound, one of the special gifts of humankind, has almost vanished like citizens fleeing an air raid alert. We are enduring days without laughter. A normal human life is inevitably filled with laughter.

Laughter is precious. Have you ever calculated its benefits? It is the solvent of tangled disputes, a necessary gift for lovers, a safe investment for merchants, a catalyst for friendship, an introducer of happiness, a great tonic for health, a special effect cure for fatigue, and the most precious and rare thing is that the giver does not spend any real capital, while the receiver feels like they have received an eternally unforgettable favor.

The most beautiful things in the world must be the various forms of laughter, right? "Let me hold the baby," when you want to take that endearing infant from the hands of a healthy mother to caress, that baby has already responded with the most innocent and lovely smile.

The laughter of chivalrous heroes after revenge, on a night with a bright moon and high buildings, in a pot of murky wine, will be as majestic and shocking as spring thunder.

In the cold dusk, on a boundless journey, a traveler suddenly hears a few chuckles from some unknown girl. Like red apricots peeking out from beyond the wall, this small embellishment to the journey is enough to make the lonely traveler forget the pain of the trek.

In a village where the autumn harvest is over, have you ever seen the old farmers with wrinkled faces basking in the sun on piles of straw in front of the eaves? They are talking about ancient and modern absurd rumors as if they were true history, and when they get to the exciting parts, they let out a burst of "haha" laughter that is as simple as their lives.

No laughter is cheaper than that of middle school girls. Some say that the laughter of three of them together is worth three acres of rice paddies filled with the sound of frogs in April.

Who says that good flowers don't last long, that good dreams and good moons don't last long either? Haven't you seen the mysterious smile of the "Mona Lisa" painted by the artist Vinci? Isn't that a semi-open flower that never fades? A crescent moon that never sets? Light clouds that never dissipate? A good dream that never shatters? Guess, what is she smiling about?

The power of laughter is great beyond compare. A woman can control the degree of another person's sadness by adjusting the depth of her smile. Many people who are as calm as old monks, as hideous as fierce ghosts, as brave as the best in the army, and as wealthy as emperors, often wave the white flag and surrender unconditionally to the "dimples." Aren't those emperors who didn't hesitate to use beacon fires to deceive the feudal lords and throw away their thrones like worn-out shoes good examples?

Bad money drives out good money, and this law can also be applied to laughter. Those laughter worth savoring were all chased away by the "haha" of the bullies. What we can hear today are all morbid laughs, such as the terrifying sneer of the violent, the treacherous laughter of the insidious, the cold laughter, the flattering laughter of the shameless, the faint smile, the tragic laughter of the insulted and injured, the bitter laughter, and the hysterical laughter of various kinds of gamblers.

Knowing smiles, innocent smiles, and joyful laughter for no reason are gradually being eliminated, so we are living days without laughter.

The laughter of the twentieth century, like wealth, has also experienced a skewed phenomenon, as if someone is hoarding and speculating, monopolizing the market for laughter. The wider their smiles spread, the higher the cries of others become.

Look at the smug look of those with fat necks, their fleshy waves overflowing from their collars as they throw their heads back and laugh!

### Sitting in the Shade of Banana Trees

### Thanks to the "Apology Delegation"

— Ying

Tetsu Katayama is singing the old tune of Sino-Japanese cooperation again, and even said that he wants to organize an "Apology Delegation" to apologize to China, "representing the Japanese people to apologize to the Chinese people for the looting behavior of the Japanese army in China." If we are not forgetful, when Prince Higashikuni was prime minister, there was also a similar plan, but it was not implemented because it was obstructed by the opposition at that time. The Japanese authorities, on the one hand, as a "defeated but not miserable" party, frequently send amorous glances to the victorious countries, saying things like "kindness is as heavy as the sky," "profound friendship," "benevolence and generosity," etc., flattering and smiling to praise the victory to the sky; on the other hand, they actively put forward plans, requesting the special privilege of immigrating to Taiwan, requesting joint administration of Ryukyu with the United States, requesting continued trusteeship of various small islands, requesting the production capacity of factories to reach a certain standard, requesting a security force of 100,000 troops... Obviously, Japan has its own wishful thinking. The dream of "rising again" is unforgettable for the Japanese people. To say a little further, please look at the imperial edict of the Japanese Emperor and the bulletin of the Suzuki cabinet at the time of surrender: they only mentioned the "Greater East Asia War" of nearly four years, but silently erased the great debt of blood that had been imposed on the Chinese people for eight years; to say a little closer, how many Japanese people, after shaking hands with you intimately, would casually say: "Japan did not launch any war of aggression!"

In their hearts is stubbornness and smirk, but on the outside they are doing their best to bow ninety degrees, which shows that the Japanese are in a delicate two extremes. They are doing their best to hope that others will be generous, so they have to do their best to suppress themselves.

What trick are they playing? Nothing else, to put it bluntly, they are on the one hand trying to rise up under the rule of the Allied countries; on the other hand, they are saying in their hearts: Let's fight again in ten years!

Looking at the current situation, the United States is accommodating Japan everywhere, sometimes even at the expense of China, which is very terrible. If Japan becomes the "watchdog of East Asia," it will not be a blessing for China, nor will it be a blessing for the world.

If the Chinese people still have a little self-awareness, I think the answer to the "Apology Delegation" that Japan is about to organize should be to ask them to put more effort into establishing a Japanese democratic government that loves peace, which is more meaningful than things like the "Apology Delegation."

### Drunk in the Spring Breeze

— Hulu

On June 1st, this newspaper reported that in this city, seven elementary school students, mistakenly believing in people's words, ran away from home, wanting to fly to the United States and enter the "Sino-American Junior Air Force School." At dusk, they got lost, stayed overnight in a hotel, were discovered by a volunteer police officer, and were taken back by their parents. Having lofty ambitions but being delusional, being young and ignorant, innocent minds not knowing the difficulties, often go astray! Vainly enlightened as immortals, wanting to be flying generals, young heroes are so ambitious!

University ideals are like high waves, diverging paths increase confusion, the long sky and thousands of miles, the wish is difficult to fulfill, regretting and sighing! Sadly opened doubts, dreams sunk hopes, the world is full of deception?

### May in the Countryside

— Mengping

Last Sunday, I returned to the countryside of Changzhou due to some business. After getting off the train, I heard that the departure time of the bus was uncertain, so I hired a bullock cart (single-key small cart) to go to the countryside. The carter bargained for the price to be calculated in rice, about one dou of rice for twenty li of road. It cost 30,000 yuan and included one meal.

Along the way, I saw that barley and wheat had already been harvested, and wheat was also waiting to be harvested. The tender green soybeans were about five inches long. Farmers and farm servants were weeding in the fields. Seven or eight-year-old and ten-year-old children herded cattle by the graves. The scene was quiet and peaceful, unlike the Shanghai people who worked hard for profit. The difference was like mud and clouds.

There were no student strikes or rice抢 (qiang) tides in the countryside. Everything was quiet. What there was was busy work (working for one day or several days) and how young and middle-aged men could avoid military service.

"There are few idle people in May in the countryside." In times of peace, there is a shortage of labor during the busy farming season in May.

Because of the shortage of labor, women began to participate in field work, which is similar to the situation in the villages near Shanghai, where men go to work in Shanghai and women till the fields. The daily wage for busy work is five jins of rice, which is 20,000 yuan, and includes meals. The price of wheat is less than 200,000 yuan per shi, which adds joy to the farmers.

"Grain is cheap and injures farmers." What farmers feel today is that when new grain or new rice is on the market, the price of wheat or grain is always particularly suitable, but when there is a shortage of grain, the price of wheat is expensive, and they are already as empty as the county magistrates, and some have to borrow money to survive.

Rural elementary schools are closed for busy farming, and teachers and students go home to help with the operations. This kind of vacation is more meaningful than ordinary summer vacations.

"May in the countryside" is the general mobilization period for agricultural producers, but unfortunately, agricultural technology lags behind and cannot cooperate with industry to improve the lives of farmers, let alone in today's world.

### The Rule of Law—Miscellaneous Notes on History—Part Eight—

— Xiao Dai

In the nomadic era when the Chinese nation was initially formed, the ancestors were busy fighting against nature; until the slightly stable agricultural era, each person "dug wells to drink and tilled fields to eat." There was little contact with other tribes, and no economic relations occurred. Moreover, the social order at that time was not established, so no one would have thought of the so-called rule of law. As history slowly evolved, because of the mutual conquests of various tribes, it entered the economic relationship from the political field. Following the gradual development of the economy, living conditions also became superior. Therefore, the luxurious life corrupted the general aristocratic class and shook the rule of the hegemons.

When Guan Zhong assisted Qi, he saw that Qi's economic situation was more advanced than other countries, and urban life was also quite developed. Therefore, many of the state's nobles were corrupted. Taking Duke Huan of Qi as an example, he had three wives and six concubines. Guan Zhong wanted to save this decadent trend and set an example, so he advocated the adoption of the rule of law to Duke Huan of Qi. His proposition is made very clear in Guan Zi Ming Fa:

The enlightened ruler is one who measures the standards and adheres to them firmly, so orders are issued and the people follow. The law is the program of the world, and the instrument of all things. ... The enlightened ruler has a system of laws, so all the ministers come from the administration of rectitude and dare not commit adultery. The people know that the Lord is engaged in the law, so the officials are used in the law, then the people follow it, and there is no way to stop it. The people use the law to resist each other, and the lower people use the law to engage with the upper people. Therefore, those who are fraudulent cannot deceive their lords, those who are jealous cannot use their treacherous hearts, those who are flattering cannot use their skills, and those who are thousands of miles away do not dare to do wrong without permission. Therefore, the Ming Law says: "Those who have laws and regulations cannot be tricked with cunning and deception."

Also, Guan Zi Ren Fa says:

"The law is the supreme way of the world and the practical use of the holy ruler. ... There are those who create the law, and those who abide by the law; the one who creates the law is the ruler, the one who abides by the law is the minister, and the one who is in the law is the people. The rulers, ministers, superiors, inferiors, nobles, and inferiors all follow the law, which is called great governance."

The author has not found reliable records of the effect of Guan Zhong's advocacy of the law, so I dare not speculate, but from Shang Yang's rule of Qin and his advocacy of the rule of law, as well as the reduction of criminal law by the Han Dynasty, etc., it also has its own advantages.

But the problem also followed. Jia Yi's criticism of the Qin law said: "Putting the world in laws and criminal law, without any kindness, and resentment filling the world, the lower people hate it as an enemy."

From here we can see that it is the "people" who are "in the law" who suffer; and the so-called "ministers" who "abide by the law" not only do not "abide by the law" but also do not suffer, but instead play with the law there. Naturally, there is no need to talk about the "ruler" who "creates the law".

### Cost of Living

A: Do you know if there is a reliable formula for estimating the cost of living?

B: Yes. Take your income, no matter how much it is, and add one hundred percent, and you can get it.

### Relief and Poverty Alleviation

— Chen Dexin

When I was a child, my teacher taught me a motto: "The best thing in life is to relieve the poor. Leftover rice and leftover food can also save people from hunger; old clothes and rags can also help people from the cold. Save one or two dishes from a banquet, save one or two gifts from generous gifts, buy one or two fewer sets of clothes, build one or two fewer houses, and buy one or two fewer pieces of furniture; save some surplus to help people in need. Getting rid of useless things can achieve great use; accumulating small favors can achieve great virtue." I think most people can do these things. Accumulating wealth is not as good as accumulating virtue, why not strive to do it?

### China Can't Build Cars

— Zenghui

On the 4th of this month, it was reported that during the discussion of the Senate on the collection of car municipal construction donations, there was the following debate:

"Zhou Xiang'sheng said, 'Business cars in foreign countries are not subject to donations.' Qu Yue retorted: 'Foreign countries can build their own cars, but China cannot build its own cars' (causing a burst of laughter)."

After reading these two sentences, I couldn't help but laugh and cry. The reason why it caused a burst of laughter was that Senator Qu's words were sharp and directed at Senator Zhou's words, but in fact, Senator Qu's words pointed out China's weaknesses and contained profound meaning.

If China could really build cars, not to mention not having to collect car construction donations, other exorbitant taxes and levies would definitely be reduced a lot, and China's economic crisis would not be so serious.

It is not that our country does not have the talent to build cars. This is a problem of the entire industry and economy. To build cars, we must first have excellent raw materials, from mining to smelting steel, building large-scale manufacturing plants, and hiring scientists to research and improve. Now we need huge funds. And in today's poor China, how can we talk about these? No wonder we collect several kinds of donations and taxes!

It is said that among the materials that Japan compensates our country, there will be a large number of town iron factories, machinery factories, and other heavy industrial equipment. I hope we can make good use of it, otherwise, in a few decades, China will still not be able to build cars.

### Literary and Art Circles

### Visiting Mei Lanfang (4)

— Feng Zikai

However, what touched me the most at that time was not these trivial matters, but the feeling of the impermanence of life. He is older than me, and is fifty-six years old this year. No matter how good his health is, how many more years can he perform? God's handmade masterpiece, which is incomparably exquisite, must collapse and become ineffective in more than ten years; and this collapse is absolutely impossible to repair! Politicians can lay the foundation for eternity, so that they can live even after death; literary and artistic artists can pass on their works to future generations, so that life is short and art is long. Because their magic weapon is not entirely in the physical body. The special masterpiece sitting in front of me now has its magic weapon entirely in this six-foot body; and this body is more fragile than this teacup. It is less durable than this sofa, and less durable than this cigarette can (he invited me to smoke Three-Five brand)! In contrast, how emotional and regretful I am? So I warmly urged him to record more phonograph records and shoot more sound and color movies in the future. Although records and movies are also perishable, they are much more permanent than these short ten years, and can also be used to comfort feelings. But according to him, there seem to be various obstacles, and he cannot do what he wants. What led me to visit was the photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan, and the two gentlemen Chen Jingyu and Sheng Xueming, who brought their cameras. The two gentlemen took many photos of us in Mr. Mei's yard. After the photography was over, I said goodbye. He shook my hand for a long time. A palmist said: "A man's hand is valuable for being soft, and a woman's hand is valuable for being hard." The softness of his hand surprised me.

After separating from Mr. Lang and others, I thought alone on the way home: From the perspective of religion's great personality with no beginning and no end, art is originally a fleeting flower and a flash of lightning; when it is spiritual, it fades, so why cherish it! It is strange that the creator is too uncalculated; since it is made so exquisitely, its warranty period should be extended; since the warranty period is not willing to be extended, then there is no need to make it so exquisitely; it can be done casually and perfunctorily, which can also make people reduce a lot of foolishness.

Alas! Mischievous creator! Suddenly, the dark clouds covered Shanghai's thousands of people. I vaguely heard the voice of the creator: "Your warranty period is one day shorter!" (End) Written in Hangzhou on June 2, 1936.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

September 17th of that year

Burnt to ashes. Jin Chengjiang, a place devoid of everything except various epidemics, unexpectedly detained the New China Theater troupe for five days. Because they had no gold bars or US dollars and were unwilling to easily disband, they couldn't find a ride to take them away quickly. Finally, gritting their teeth, they squeezed onto a slow, ox-paced vehicle together, quietly leaving this desperate place.

The rumors spread like wildfire, growing more intense daily. Some even said that Japanese soldiers in plainclothes had entered Guizhou.

Life on the train was truly unbearable! The locomotive, pulling a mixed passenger and freight train three or four times longer than usual, lacked sufficient coal and couldn't move as it pleased. Every few kilometers, obstacles appeared on the tracks, so its speed was even slower than a hand-pushed wheelbarrow. The train was so crowded that every place where one could stand, sit, or hang was utilized. Lao Zhu spent an entire day and night holding Fei Fei, perched high on the back of a seat in a third-class carriage, like a bird huddled in a cage, or even worse. Because even though a bird in a cage cannot fly, at least it can turn its body or hop up and down, but Lao Zhu absolutely could not. He seemed to have become a taxidermied bird, pinned to the cedar-wood backrest. People were all around him, and if they didn't jostle him, he couldn't move at all. In reality, even if they wanted to give him space, they couldn't, because they were also squeezed by others. The entire carriage, with hundreds of people, had frozen into an immobile mass. The air was filled with carbon dioxide exhaled from people's mouths and noses, plus the unbearable stench from people relieving themselves everywhere, causing the old, weak, women, and children to gradually become unable to endure it and faint.

Fei Fei was a child under eight years old, forced to curl up in Lao Zhu's arms, not moving for an entire day and night, which was even more painful than adults enduring the journey. Getting food was so difficult. Not to mention meals, even plain water was often unavailable for four or five hours at a time. When she needed to relieve herself, Lao Zhu had to negotiate with the people sitting nearby to make way for her. He was anxious that Fei Fei would get sick from hunger and thirst, so from the moment he boarded the train, he was worried about Fei Fei getting sick.
