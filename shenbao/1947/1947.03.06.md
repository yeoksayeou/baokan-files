The Communist Army in Jiaodong Continuously Increases
Fierce Street Fighting Occurred in Gaomi Yesterday
Intense Battles Rage in the Outskirts of Jimo and Jiaoxian
〔Our Jinan Office, 5th〕Battles are intensifying in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, particularly in the outskirts of Gaomi and Weixian. In Gaomi, the number of Communist troops attacking from the north and south had increased to 40,000 to 50,000 by the evening of the 3rd. Facing such a disparity in numbers, the National Army shortened its defense lines, abandoning Xia Village in the north of the city and Chaigou in the south. On the morning of the 4th, fierce fighting began in the suburbs. By the evening of the 4th, the Communist forces had further increased, with some infiltrating the city, resulting in ongoing street fighting until the morning of the 5th. Moreover, in the Zuoshan area outside Weixian, the Communist forces, in overwhelming numbers, besieged the railway station, leading to intense battles for four days and nights, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. As of the morning of the 5th, the situation there was unclear. The Shamatun railway station between that station and Weixian also became a battleground, with fierce fighting. It is reported that after the Communist forces attacking Changle and the vicinity of Changyi were repelled, the 9th Division of the Liberation Army was being redeployed from Zhangdian to the southeast of Shouguang, attempting to attack the northwest side of Weixian again. However, the National Army's strength in that area is substantial, making this strategic point in the central section of the Jiaoji Railway likely to be secured. Around Qingdao, near Jimo and Jiaoxian, there have only been minor skirmishes in recent days, all of which have been repelled by the National Army.

〔Central News Agency, Qingdao, 5th〕More than 10,000 Communist soldiers attacked the outskirts of Jimo on the morning of the 5th, but were repelled by the defending troops in a pincer movement. Additionally, more than 20,000 Communist soldiers, accompanied by over ten artillery pieces, launched a fierce attack on the outer strongholds of Jiaoxian on the morning of the 5th, leading to intense fighting.

〔Our Xuzhou Office, 5th〕Approximately 80,000 Communist troops from four divisions and three brigades of the Shandong Communist Army are attacking Gaomi, and fierce battles are taking place. The 6th Division of the Communist Liberation Army has infiltrated the area more than 30 li north of Gaomi. The 5th Division of the Liberation Army and the 5th Police Brigade have infiltrated Sunkou, north of Jiaoxian. The 3rd Independent Brigade has infiltrated the northern countryside of Zhucheng. The 3rd Reorganized Brigade departed from Xinhe, northeast of Changyi, on the 3rd and is heading towards Pingdu. The 9th Division and the 7th Division of the Liberation Army advanced rapidly through Yidu and Shouguang towards the northeast of Weixian on the 4th. The battle situation in the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway has reached a decisive stage.

〔Our Jinan Office, 5th〕The strength of the Communist forces outside Jinan has slightly increased in the past two days. However, the National Army is strong, and security is assured. Moreover, the situation at Tanjiafangzi Railway Station, west of Changle, is unclear.

〔Our Jinan Office, 5th〕A major battle is brewing along the Jinpu Railway, but there are currently no intense clashes. The majority of the Communist forces continue to concentrate near Tai'an.

〔Our Xuzhou Office, 5th〕More than 10,000 troops from the Communist New 10th Division have recently infiltrated the area around Gao Village, Xiji, and Guojiazhuang, about 30 li north of Zaozhuang. The National Army recaptured Guoliji, 32 li northeast of Zaozhuang, at 11:00 AM on the 4th, and continues to encircle and annihilate the Communist forces in the area north of Zaozhuang.

Taiwanese Residents in Shanghai Hosted Press Yesterday
Reporting the Beginning and End of the Taipei Conflict
〔Reported by this newspaper〕Regarding the unfortunate incident of the recent military-civilian conflict in Taipei, six organizations in the city—the Shanghai Branch of the Taiwan Provincial Political Construction Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Fujian-Taiwan Construction Advancement Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Taiwan Reconstruction Society, the Association of Taiwanese Compatriots in Shanghai, the Taiwan Students Association in Shanghai, and the Taiqing Innovation Association—organized the "Joint Support Association for the February 28th Incident in Taiwan" to report the truth about the tragedy and call for reforms in Taiwan's administration. They hosted a press conference at the Atlantic Restaurant at 5:00 PM yesterday, gravely reporting the course of the tragedy and the various inappropriate measures taken by the Taiwan Governor-General's Office over the past year. According to reports, on February 28th, armed military police from the Taipei Monopoly Bureau arrested street vendors near the train station for inspecting "non-monopoly" cigarettes. Nearby residents went to the Monopoly Bureau to plead for leniency but were shot at, resulting in the deaths of two civilians. This provoked the masses to petition the Governor-General's Office, but they were met with machine gun fire from the guards surrounding the office. While the crowd dispersed, they were relentlessly pursued, leading to widespread military-civilian conflicts. The bloody tragedy lasted for dozens of hours, resulting in 100 to 200 deaths and 3,000 to 4,000 injuries. The above information was obtained by Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai through four long-distance phone calls to reliable sources in Taiwan. Since the tragedy occurred, the entire region from Taipei to Keelung in the north and Kaohsiung in the south has been in turmoil, and armed uprisings have erupted in various places. Taiwanese compatriots in Shanghai are deeply concerned about the crisis and are calling for reforms to the current situation, putting forward twelve demands for the people of Taiwan: (1) Demand equal treatment from the motherland; (2) Oppose the special treatment of Taiwan; (3) Immediately implement autonomy, with popularly elected governors and county magistrates; (4) Abolish the special Administrative Governor system and all other special laws and regulations; (5) Eliminate Taiwan's unique monopolies and provincially-controlled trade; (6) Eradicate bureaucratic capitalism that relies on the Bank of Taiwan and trade companies for national profit; (7) Remove Chen Yi and severely punish the perpetrators; (8) Provide compensation to the injured and the families of the deceased, immediately release the arrested civilians, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again; (9) All state-owned land, forests, mines, factories, and railways in Taiwan should belong to the public for the benefit of the people of Taiwan; (10) Oppose the plundering of Taiwanese rice and sugar; (11) Taiwan is not a colony; (12) The people of Taiwan demand the right to survival.

Regulations on Constitutional Governance Will Soon Be Drafted
〔Our Nanjing Office, 5th〕The Legislative Yuan's Constitutional Law Committee held its first meeting at 10:00 AM on the 5th, chaired by Liu Kejun. The drafting representative, Hong Lanyou, was invited to explain the process. Representatives from the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior also attended. Hong initially explained the drafting process regarding the population figures in the regulations. The discussion then focused on the population issue, with participants recognizing that population is a fundamental issue for all election laws and should be given special attention. The participants felt that the population statistics from the Ministry of Interior were extremely inaccurate. It was then decided that the Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Food, Ministry of Social Affairs, and Ministry of Interior would jointly reach a conclusive agreement, to be submitted to the Yuan within ten days so that a second meeting could be held to discuss the regulations. The meeting would then be submitted to a plenary session for discussion and is expected to be completed by the end of the month.

The Course of Victory on the Outskirts of Changchun
Du Yuming Receives Chinese and Foreign Reporters for Talks
Minister Bai and Chief of Staff Chen Issue Special Telegrams of Commendation
〔Our Changchun Office, 4th〕Minister Bai and Chief of Staff Chen issued special telegrams to Director Du Yuming (see picture) and Army Commander Sun Liren, among others, to commend them for the victory in the battles on the outskirts of Changshikou.

〔Our Changchun Office, 4th〕Director Du Yuming and Deputy Army Commander Mai Youqiao of the New First Army, who had just recovered from illness and were busy with work, seemed to be in a relaxed mood on the 4th. Reporters who visited found that the tense atmosphere of the past was gone, and they were told that good news would be shared regarding the battle situation.

Counter-Encirclement and Defeat of the Communist Army: National Army Achieves Strategic Success
〔Central News Agency, Changchun, 4th〕Director Du spoke freely on the 4th about the victory on the outskirts of Changchun. According to him, the Communist army had launched a full-scale offensive, originally planning to encircle Changchun from both flanks. However, our forces countered with an encirclement of their own, breaking their plans. When the Communist forces bypassed Dehui on the Chang-Ha Railway front, they assumed that our army would also defend the Chengan line on the Chang-Tao Railway and the Jiutai line on the Ji-Chang Railway. However, when they launched fierce attacks on these two cities, our army had already withdrawn. The Communist forces, having failed to achieve their goals on both flanks, then dug in on the main front, attempting to prevent reinforcements from the National Army while simultaneously attacking Dehui in order to eliminate the threat to their rear. At this point, our initial strategy of "strategic retreat, luring the enemy in deep" had succeeded, and reinforcements had arrived. We then ordered our forces to extend their flanks and implement a counter-encirclement, defeating the Communist forces in one fell swoop. Du expressed great satisfaction that traffic on the Chang-Shen section of the China Chang Railway had remained open throughout the engagement. He also praised the county magistrates along the line for their efforts in maintaining local order and for their quick response, as well as the military transport personnel and railway workers for their contributions. He also noted that the mopping-up operations conducted in Suizhong and other areas along the railway not long ago had played a significant role in maintaining traffic on the Chang-Pan Railway. Du stated that the Communist forces that had attacked consisted of 15 divisions (including approximately 2,000 Japanese), one independent brigade, and 120 to 200 small field guns of 115mm and 75mm caliber, as well as 21 tanks. He estimated that they had lost at least 20,000 men killed or wounded, as well as 4 tanks and a number of large guns. Our side, including local militia, had suffered only about 3,600 casualties. After speaking with Du, reporters continued to visit a senior officer directly involved in commanding the front-line operations, hoping to obtain a more precise figure for the Communist army's casualties. According to this officer, "The Director is always very careful in estimating the enemy's casualties, and the figures he mentioned have likely been discounted. To my knowledge, the Communist army's casualties were at least no fewer than 30,000."

Only 38,000 Communist Troops Remain on the South Bank of the Songhua River and Near Jilin
〔United Press, Changchun, 4th〕Du Yuming, Commander of the Northeast Security Headquarters, met with seven foreign reporters at the residence of Mayor Zhao Junmai on the 4th and discussed the military situation in the Northeast. He stated that the National Army's 54th and 71st Divisions had rushed from Shenyang and Sipingjie to the rescue, shattering Lin Biao's spring offensive. The Communist forces, with a force of 140,000, had failed to capture Dehui, 52 miles northeast of Changchun, and had briefly infiltrated to within 20 miles of Changchun. However, after seven days of bloody fighting, the siege of Dehui was lifted, and the Communist army's five infantry divisions and three artillery divisions were routed, leaving only 30,000 men remaining near the south bank of the Songhua River and near Jilin. Du also stated: (1) The National Army could recover Harbin within ten days, but has not yet received orders to attack. (2) He expects the Communist army to launch another attack on Changchun within a month. (3) Before the attack, Lin Biao had told his subordinates that if he failed to capture Dehui, he would resign. (4) Peace in the Northeast could be achieved if the Communist side repented. Du added that Lin Biao's forces had launched their six-month-long spring offensive, with Changchun as their destination, deploying 20 divisions, of which 15 had crossed the frozen Songhua River. Ten thousand Communist troops attempted to breach the National Army's bridgehead at Taolai Zhao, but were repelled by a defending force of less than a company. Lin Biao's plan was to first attack Jiutai, then Dehui, and finally advance on Changchun, aiming to capture Dehui within four days. However, due to the National Army's reinforcements and counter-attacks, 20,000 Communist soldiers were defeated and retreated.

The Issue of the National Army Taking Over Dalian Must Await Government Orders
〔Our Shenyang Office, 3rd〕Regarding the issue of the National Army taking over Dalian, it is widely believed that a decision must await the conclusion of the fighting in Jiaodong.

〔Agence France-Presse, Changchun, 4th〕General Du Yuming stated: "I am not entirely clear on the current situation in Dalian. Once I receive instructions from the government authorities, I can lead my troops into Dalian within a few days." When asked by reporters when the Soviet army would withdraw from Dalian, General Du immediately replied, "Please ask Stalin." Regarding the deployment of Chinese and Soviet troops on the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula, Soviet outposts are currently stationed six miles south of Pulandian, while the National Army remains in its original position. The demarcation line between the Soviet-occupied zone of Lushun and other parts of the Northeast is patrolled by Soviet troops. This demarcation line is consistent with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Between the Soviet patrols and the National Army patrols is a "no-man's land" approximately 10 to 20 kilometers wide, in which a fully equipped Communist army division, under the command of Lin Biao, commander of the "Northeast Democratic Allied Army," is stationed.

The UNRRA Central Committee Approves
The Cotton Shipment to China Sales Plan
An Amount of Five Million US Dollars Will Be Allocated to Relieve the Poor
〔Central News Agency, Washington, 5th, United Press〕The UNRRA Central Committee today approved a $5 million China "Open Market" cotton sales plan. The nine-nation committee, which is the policy-making body of the UNRRA, held a three-hour closed session to consider the plan. The approved plan is a modified version of the original proposal to ship millions of dollars worth of cotton to China to be woven into cloth, which will then be sold by merchants. It is reported that the profits from the sale of these goods will be mainly used to support the Chinese Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. UNRRA officials say it is doubtful whether this batch of cotton can be shipped in the near future due to the current financial situation of the UNRRA, which is still being sorted out. The plan also stipulates that China should allocate 10% of the cloth and 5% of the cotton directly to the poor for mending winter clothing.

〔This City News〕Chen Jiakang, Pan Zinian, and thirty-one other members of the Communist Shanghai Liaison Office and Xinhua Daily personnel, departed yesterday morning at 9:00 AM by military transport for Beijing, en route to Yan'an.

〔Our Nanjing Office, 5th〕The thirty-three Communist Shanghai Office personnel arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at 4:10 PM on the 5th. They were escorted along the way and arrived safely.

The US Military Attaché Stored Farewell to Dong Biwu, Wang Bingnan, and Others at Noon on the 5th.
Zhou Enlai's Residence is Empty
Shaking Hands at the North Station
〔Reported by this newspaper〕At 7:00 AM yesterday, Sinan Road was still quiet with few pedestrians, but Zhou Enlai's residence at No. 107 was unusually busy. All luggage had been packed in advance, and the cups and bowls in the living room were in disarray after a hasty breakfast. Security personnel were busy directing trucks and assisting with moving luggage. Foreign and Chinese journalists on the scene were capturing this memorable scene with various cameras.

At 7:15 AM, a large military truck carrying luggage arrived, and the staff of the office carefully counted each piece of luggage as it was loaded. To unsuspecting passersby, it might have seemed like a mansion was moving. Around 7:30 AM, a large blue car arrived, and thirteen staff members of the office boarded the car and set off. Part of the Sixth and Seventh Mobile Army of the Garrison Command escorted them along the way, along with the reporters' cars, forming a formidable procession. However, not many people stopped to watch as they passed Linsen Road, perhaps because the common people were busy with their lives and not very interested in such dramatic political scenes. The cars arrived at No. 25 Xikou Road around 8:00 AM, picked up the twenty-one staff members of Xinhua Daily, and headed straight to the station at 8:15 AM.

The North Station was heavily guarded yesterday, with many personnel deployed. The captains of the Garrison Command, Qi Zaiyu and Liang Zhiping, personally directed the operations on the scene. A first-class special train was already prepared, and the Communist personnel boarded the train one after another, with the security personnel assisting with loading the luggage. It was planned that a detachment would escort them to Nanjing.

The Communist personnel were very silent yesterday. Chen Jiakang still greeted acquaintances with a smile, but the smile was somewhat forced. He said that the office building would be temporarily managed by the Lujiawan Branch Bureau, and they were willing to provide it for use by the Democratic League, but whether it could be done would have to be decided by the government. Pan Zinian told reporters that there were more than two hundred employees at the Chongqing Xinhua Daily, but only one hundred of them had a way to fly to Yan'an.

At the North Station, Chen Jiakang boarded the train last. He thanked Captain Wei Zaiyu and the deputy captain in a "gentlemanly" manner and bid farewell to the reporters who were seeing them off, expressing his hope to return to Shanghai soon and have a joyous reunion.

Since the 28th of last month, the Communist office had been under strict protection. Yesterday was the last day of activity, and it will be a long period of calm afterward. The staff of the police bureau and the garrison command were polite and enthusiastic in assisting with the Communist Party's move yesterday, and there was plenty of courtesy and politeness between them. However, the people who saw them off on the scene were all aware that this was a major event of the year, and that the state affairs would enter a new stage from now on.

US Side Announces Work Progress in Assisting Communist Personnel with Withdrawal
〔Our Nanjing Office, 5th〕The US government announced the progress of its work in assisting Communist personnel with their withdrawal to the Communist-controlled areas: This work includes Communist Party personnel from the Executive Headquarters in Beijing and Communist personnel involved in peace talks in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing. It was originally scheduled for seventy Communist personnel to depart on two C-47 aircraft from Chongqing to Yan'an today. However, the actual number of passengers was only twenty today. Later, due to a malfunction, the aircraft returned to Nanjing. It is now planned that the aircraft will carry fifty Communist personnel from Chongqing to Yan'an on the 6th and another fifty on the 8th. The number of Communist personnel withdrawing from Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing exceeds the number of peace talk personnel mentioned by Zhou Enlai to General Marshall by forty-six. They all urgently need air transport. To avoid disputes, the US side has accepted this increased number. The number of Communist personnel ordered to withdraw by the garrison commands in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing, including personnel from Communist newspapers and bookstores, exceeds the number carried by the US aircraft. The Chinese government has notified the US Embassy, requesting that the government provide the necessary transportation for the withdrawal of these Communist personnel to the Communist-controlled areas.

The New Portuguese Minister Arrives in Beijing
〔Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th〕The newly appointed Portuguese Minister to China, Ferreira, and Secretary Afule, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 5th. In the afternoon, they met with reporters from the Central News Agency alone, emphasizing the urgent need to strengthen Sino-Portuguese relations and hoping that the new Sino-Portuguese Treaty and the Sino-Portuguese Commercial Treaty could be finalized soon. Ferreira stated that extraterritoriality for Portugal in China had been abolished in practice long ago, and the Portuguese government had stated that it was only waiting for the new treaty to be put in writing. Sino-Portuguese trade had been interrupted due to the war, and a new commercial treaty was urgently needed to serve as a guideline for future trade. Ferreira declined to comment on the Macau issue, but according to sources from the Central News Agency, the delay in finalizing the new Sino-Portuguese Treaty was mainly due to the Macau issue, as officials believed that the Macau issue should be resolved at the same time as the new treaty was signed.

Nine Hundred Tons of Japanese Reparations Materials
The United States Supports Our Acquisition of Half
Zhou Maobo, Representative of Our Small Group, Flies to Japan Tonight
〔Reported by this newspaper〕Zhou Maobo, representative of our country's small group for Japanese reparations, took a US Air Transport Command plane to Japan last night. Another representative is scheduled to depart this Saturday. Yun Zhen has not yet decided on a date to go to Japan because the budget for using Japanese reparations materials is still being studied. It is reported that Li Daican, a representative of our five-person group, recently attended a meeting of the Allied Headquarters and decided that our representatives should visit Japanese aircraft factories, ordnance factories, machine tool factories, and twelve thermal power plants for reference when dealing with practical issues. As for the amount of reparations materials that our country may obtain, it is reported that the Soviet Union will support our acquisition of half of the nine million tons, but the final decision needs to be made by the Allied Council for Japan. The transportation problem is not as serious as imagined. According to personnel from the transportation team in the delegation, even if there are millions of tons of materials, they can be transported within a year. In the future, most of the remaining materials will be carried back by our empty freighters returning from Japan to avoid uneconomical breaks in transportation. A large number of Liberty ships will be available. Furthermore, the transportation of reparations materials to China will be based on the principle of direct shipment to the construction site. The steel industry will focus on the Northeast, while other industries will remain centered in Central and Southern China. The government welcomes private manufacturers to participate in the utilization of reparations materials. Some items that cannot be operated by private financial resources will be operated by the state.

Investigation of the Sen Du Grain Hoarding Case
Six Rice Merchants Are Highly Suspected
〔Our Suzhou Office, 5th〕The case of large-scale grain hoarding in Mu Du was investigated for the first time today at the Wudi Procuratorate.

The Ministry immediately dispatched Guo Zhaoxi, an auditor from the Ministry of Finance, Zhu Shengquan, a specialist from the Four-Bank Joint Office, and Long Saxu, a section member from the Police Bureau, to conduct an inspection. In the safe in the office of Huang Hanliang, director of the bank, and in the safe in the deputy manager's office, they found gold, U.S. dollars, and other items, and in Huang Hanliang's office, they found ledgers of private gold and U.S. dollar transactions. Because it was late, the inspectors transferred the relevant ledgers of private buying and selling of U.S. dollars and gold to the Ministry of Finance's office No. 217 in the Bank of China for detailed examination, and instructed Huang Hanliang, Zhou Youmo, and Huang's personal secretary, a Mr. Chen, to come together to explain the contents of the ledgers. At the same time, Xu, the section chief from the Police Bureau, was invited to the office and informed that the suspected criminals should be arrested and handled according to legal procedures.

The three inspectors, Guo, Long, and Zhu, inspected the accounts overnight and discovered that Huang Hanliang was indeed suspected of private buying and selling of gold and U.S. dollars. The inspectors immediately submitted an urgent report. The next morning, on one hand, the original inspectors continued to inspect the remaining accounts of the bank, and on the other hand, Gao, the deputy director of the Auditing Department of the Central Bank, and He, a consultant from the Ministry of Finance, contacted Commander Xuan of the Garrison Command to order the Police Bureau to monitor Huang Hanliang's movements.

Carriages are used to pick up passengers from ships and trains, and most of the large hotels are located in the central district. Now the city government has successively banned carriages from operating in the central district all day, which is tantamount to cutting off the livelihood of all the workers. At the same time, the racecourse has not been opened, making it impossible to find another way to make a living. They have no choice but to request the authorities to lift the ban.

Postage Rates Not Increasing Is Considered Unreasonable: Gu Chunfan Tells Reporters

[Our Newspaper's Report] Director of Finance Gu Chunfan told reporters yesterday: The Municipal Government's budget for this year was originally 250 billion in expenditures. After various efforts to increase income to 240 billion, the remaining 10 billion could still be made up. However, due to the surge in prices this time, various bureaus have successively requested the Municipal Council to add a total of 180 billion to the budget, making it even more difficult to balance the budget. The tax revenue situation this year will be acceptable if the market is good, but otherwise, the deficit will be even greater. Gu said that after the Municipal Council finalizes the budget for this year, he will leave this position and specialize in managing the Foreign Exchange Bureau. At that time, the position of Director of Finance will be taken over by someone else appointed by the central government. Regarding whether postage rates should be increased, Gu said: The government is currently losing a lot of money on postal services every month. If postage rates are increased, the amount of the increase will be borne by the senders of letters. If postage rates are not increased, the amount of the deficit will be made up by the government through issuing more currency or increasing taxes, which will also increase the burden on the people, but the senders of letters will benefit from this. Therefore, he believes that not increasing postage rates is unreasonable.

The Municipal Government Will Reduce Personnel: The Earliest Must Be After June to Avoid Temporarily Affecting Public Affairs; New Budget Compilation Begins Elimination

After the organizational regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Government passed by the Executive Yuan were revealed, Municipal Government personnel, councilors, and people from all walks of life have paid close attention. In addition to submitting a request to the Executive Yuan to send personnel to Shanghai for inspection before making a decision, the Municipal Government Standing Committee has taken no other action for the time being. Yesterday, reporters made a special visit to relevant parties, who claimed: The original staffing of the various bureaus and affiliated agencies of this Municipal Government totaled 18,394 people, but after repeated streamlining, it is now 15,207 people, a factual reduction of 3,187 people. In order to enhance administrative efficiency, for municipal administration in such a large city, such as police affairs, public works, taxation, and other implementation work, it would be difficult to attend to everything and mistakes would be inevitable if the staffing were not appropriate. Therefore, the enhancement of administrative efficiency is not entirely unrelated to the number of people, but rather to seeking appropriateness. As for the organizational regulations of this city passed by the Executive Yuan this time, the reduction is too great, making it difficult to proceed. Therefore, the Municipal Government has requested the Executive Yuan to reconsider. Even if the Executive Yuan still insists on the original organizational rules, the Municipal Government can also follow the regulations issued by the National Government in the early days of the victory against Japan, which stated that the administrative heads of provinces and cities in the recovered areas can establish the necessary institutions according to local conditions to facilitate public affairs, and postpone compliance until after August of this year. Moreover, even after the Executive Yuan approves it, it will still take time for official exchanges, and the earliest it can be achieved will be around June. Therefore, the simplification of Municipal Government affairs can only be implemented in the second half of the year. However, it is learned that in order to avoid eliminating too many people during the implementation period and affecting public affairs, the Municipal Government plans to start a partial elimination during the compilation of the new budget this time.

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the arrest of the "Four Famous Mountains" thief gang members Liu Hangxia, Liu Huaide, and Zhang Zhiqing, the prosecutor Fang Zhengzhi of the District Prosecutor's Office concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution. The indictment stated that Liu Hangxia graduated from Tianfu High School in Chengdu in the 30th year of the Republic [1941] and later passed the exam to work in the Aviation Committee, serving in the 14th Air Force in Kunming in the 32nd year of the Republic [1943].

While in Chongqing, he and his cousin Liu Huaide lived at No. 154 Anle Cave, Tongyi Men. At that time, they joined forces with Li Benchu, Hu Fei, and others to display their stealing skills, committing numerous crimes. Later, they stole 30,000 US dollars from the US dollar market on Shanxi Street in Chongqing. This case attracted great attention from the local military police, and Liu fled to Kunming, Chengdu, and other places to steal. After the victory, Liu Hangxia, Liu Huaide, and their fellow gang members Liu Jinshan, Luo Jixiong, and others went down the Yangtze River and joined Zhang Zhiqing in Yichang. On December 20 of last year, they entered the Nanjing-Shanghai area and opened five inns in this city to hide. They repeatedly used their habitual skills of cutting bags and picking pockets in public places. Later, they stole a "leather suitcase" at Longhua Airport. Liu Hangxia saw that it contained blank leave certificates and official documents from the 1st Battalion of the 5th Military Region, so he discussed it with his cousin Liu Huaide and purchased air force uniforms. Liu Hangxia used the blank leave certificate to fill in the words "Liu Hangxia, Lieutenant Flying Staff Officer of the 3rd Company." Liu Huaide held a pass from the "Political Department of the 55th Army of the Army" and impersonated a soldier to carry out theft. On January 30 of this year, Liu Hangxia and Luo Tiexiong (alias Xia Qing), who was still at large, were caught by the Railway Bureau Police Department while stealing on the 10th Third Class train on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway.

He was released from prison at the time of victory and continued to associate with Liu, often spending time at the residence of Shen's sister on the upper floor of the Yong'an Tofu Shop at No. 57 Xinjiang Road. Recently, Shen learned about Liu's adultery with Liu and went to reason with them, wanting to kill Liu. After Liu agreed, at 6:00 PM on the 26th of last month, Liu invited Liu to Tang Ershun's place at No. 247 Baohechang Chinese Medicine Shop on Baoxing Road. While passing Song Park Road, Shen, who had been lying in ambush at the corner of the road, pulled out a gun and fired three shots. One bullet grazed Liu's left forehead, causing only skin damage, and he fell to the ground. At that time, Shen and Liu fled together. Later, Liu reported to the Zhabei Branch Bureau, and Inspector Wang Shusheng and Police Chief Zhang Hualing arrested Liu, while the murderer Shen Xieshi is still at large.

Four Defendants in the Murder of the Lei A'er Couple Were Tried Yesterday; The Carpenter's Wife Was Strangled to Death; The Shepherd Is Highly Suspected

[Our Newspaper's Report] The District Court tried two murder cases yesterday, which are recorded as follows: (1) Dong Asan and Dong Qilin from Pudong accused Cai Miaogen, Huang Xiaohashang, Lu A'tu, and Huang Amao of murdering Dong A'er and his wife. Their complaint stated: The defendants Cai Miaogen and the other three were neighbors of the deceased. The four had stolen Dong's property and were reported by the deceased to the Pudong Third District Office before their death, thus creating enmity. In November of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], when the National Army withdrew to the west, the situation was chaotic, and the four defendants took the opportunity to conspire to kill Dong. On the 4th of the same month, they took the opportunity when Dong A'er and Wei Tianhong went to Zhoupu to shop and forcibly dragged them to the Liu Family Residence, where they were cut and killed with a knife. At 9:00 PM on the same night, they went to Dong A'er's home and killed his wife in an attempt to silence them. The incident was known to neighbors Zhu Chenjia and others. The case was filed in the puppet court at that time in the 26th to 28th years of the Republic [1937-1939], but no result was obtained. At the court hearing yesterday, Cai Miaogen and the other four all denied killing Dong A'er and his wife. The court ordered a postponement for further trial because it was still necessary to summon witnesses. (2) Huang Miaoxiu, a carpenter at No. 66 Tunliang Lane, Gaoqiao, his wife, Shen Fengxing, was strangled to death in her residence on the night of January 19 of this year. Judging from the situation, it seemed that she had been murdered after resisting rape. Huang 　Gen, a shepherd at her house, was highly suspected and was prosecuted by the prosecutor on suspicion of murder. At the court hearing yesterday, Fei 　Gen denied the murder, but said: It was rumored that the deceased had a housing dispute with Wang Caifu and Wang Yinquan, so she was strangled to death with a straw rope. The court scheduled a retrial for Wang Caifu and Wang Yinquan on March 12.

Vast Acres of Fields Without Seeds: The Spring Lament of the Yellow River Flood Area
Kaifeng, February 25th (Airmail) – Our Correspondent in Bian, Wang Shoumei – The Yellow River breach was a calamity for the nation and is recorded in local history. Twenty counties in Henan Province were affected, with 6,669,554 mu of fertile land inundated. For nine years, the people in the flooded area have been living in dire straits. After the restoration, the government and relief organizations, recognizing the extreme severity of the disaster, mobilized significant manpower and resources for the breach closure project and post-disaster relief. Now that the closure is nearing completion, increasing numbers of refugees are returning home, but the looming food crisis has become a serious problem. According to investigations, the grain yield of the affected counties last year was far from sufficient to feed the current population for even half a year. Government relief is limited, and the people are threatened by starvation. Many are willing to sell their last possessions just to alleviate their hunger, leading to endless, tragic and self-defeating situations. Although the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (ERRRA) and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) have established the "Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Yellow River Flood Area Reconstruction and Design Committee" and proposed comprehensive plans, and although the Henan branch of ERRRA, the UNRRA office in Henan, and the Henan Provincial Government convened a reconstruction meeting last month and made numerous important resolutions, there has been no concrete implementation, and the situation is far from being resolved. The spring plowing season is only a month away. If the government immediately allocates substantial funds to provide seeds for spring plowing and assist the returning refugees in timely cultivation to restore local food production, then this serious problem can be solved. The Henan branch of ERRRA is extremely concerned about this matter. It has drafted a budget for the minimum materials and funds urgently needed for the most pressing tasks from January to April this year, totaling 8 billion yuan and over 7,900 tons of materials. Among the most urgent needs is 4 billion yuan for spring plowing seed loans in the flooded area. The branch has repeatedly telegraphed ERRRA headquarters to quickly remit the special funds, emphasizing that cultivation is time-sensitive and the loan procedures must be completed before April 15th, otherwise the entire plan will become a mere illusion. However, the special funds are still nowhere in sight. Feeling the urgency and pressure of the situation, all the staff of the branch have voluntarily contributed at least 20,000 yuan each for spring plowing seeds in the flooded area, raising a total of 100 million yuan, which has been remitted to Luohe to purchase seeds. However, this is merely a drop in the bucket and cannot alleviate the spring woes of the flood area. People from all walks of life here are deeply concerned about this matter, and newspapers are also paying close attention. The Bian Foreign Correspondents Association, to draw attention to this serious issue, is organizing a variety show to raise funds to purchase spring plowing seeds for the flooded area in conjunction with the government and social relief organizations. However, the key lies in whether the government can allocate substantial funds soon as the fundamental way to solve the problem. If the special funds cannot be allocated as scheduled, then the vast acres of fertile land in the flooded area will remain barren, and the spring woes of the refugees will inevitably turn into summer hardships, autumn fears, and winter deaths.

Yellow River Huayuankou
Zhengzhou, February 24th (Airmail) – Our Correspondent in Zheng, Fan Shiqin – The Huayuankou breach closure project was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of July last year, but it failed. Then, it was rescheduled to be completed by the end of January this year, but it failed again. Now, it has been rescheduled to be completed before the peach blossom flood in April this year. This time, success is the only option, failure is not allowed. Otherwise, waiting for the completion of the Huayuankou breach closure would be like waiting for the Yellow River to run clear. During this extended period of breach closure, there has been a major technical change: switching from "horizontal closure" to "vertical closure." It is said that the horizontal closure method was an innovation in Yellow River breach closures. The method involved driving piles at the breach, building a bridge, and then dumping stones batch by batch under the bridge, gradually closing the breach. Its advantage was that before it was completely closed, the water would flow through evenly, and when it was about to be completely closed, the water would slowly stop flowing behind it, allowing the area behind it to accumulate sediment and turn into fertile land. This method was very scientific and had been tested once, but unfortunately, it failed. The so-called vertical closure is a "final closure," which is an old Chinese method. Old Chinese methods sometimes become popular. This both fuels the arrogance of those who blindly stick to the old ways and provides a merciless mockery of those who blindly admire the new. This time, the breach closure project is adopting the vertical closure method, but it is not entirely the old-fashioned final closure method. In the past, the old-fashioned final closure method involved building high embankments on both sides of the breach, leaving a gap, and then placing a lid over the gap. All the materials for filling the gap were piled on the lid, and finally, all the materials were hammered down at once. This method either succeeds or fails with that one hammer blow. It is similar to the guillotine, but the Yellow River's water is harder than the head of any hero. This hammer blow often fails to sever the Yellow River's water flow. Therefore, this time, the final closure method involves throwing willow bundles one by one into the gap and gradually blocking it. The situation at the Huayuankou construction site during the period when the horizontal closure method was adopted was completely different from the current period when the vertical closure method has been adopted. Initially, a long bridge was built over the breach, and some workers were carrying stones and soil on the bridge and under it. If it were not said to be a breach closure project, one would have thought it was just ordinary bridge work. Now, that long bridge is gone, replaced by long embankments on both sides of the breach and a gap in between. Behind the embankments, there are three square-shaped dams, and workers are filling the squares with soil. The gap is 30 meters wide, with water flowing rapidly at the bottom. It is said that the depth is over 10 meters and the water flow rate is 400 cubic meters per second. An interesting railway bridge hangs halfway across the gap. Walking across it makes you bounce up and down, like walking a tightrope in a circus. From a distance, it looks like you are running in the air, floating like an immortal. Stones are passed from one embankment to the other using a basket suspended above the gap, like the Shanghai Commercial Press delivering money and invoices, saving a lot of manpower. The situation at the Huayuankou construction site has changed a lot since construction began. It is one way for a while, and then another. To put it bluntly, it is like child's play, stacking things up, playing this way one moment, and playing that way the next. We hope that they can finish playing, or else they will not be able to keep playing. The difficulty of the Huayuankou breach closure project lies in simultaneously diverting water into the diversion channel and blocking the breach. Although there is water flowing in the diversion channel, it is not much and cannot alleviate the pressure on the breach. Because the old Yellow River channel has been cut off for many years and has been heavily silted up, it is necessary to raise the Yellow River's water level before diverting water to scour the channel. However, raising the water level too high could jeopardize the breach closure project. This matter is as easy to cause trouble as raising foreign exchange rates. Currently, a third diversion channel is being added near Huayuankou, and water will probably be released around March 5th. This period will be a difficult one. The director of the engineering bureau, Zhu Guangcai, was so anxious when the water was released into the diversion channel last time that he shed tears, but it was useless. Is the Yellow River's heart harder than the Great Wall, or is Director Zhu's sorrow less poignant than that of Meng Jiangnu? The Chinese Communists are constantly creating malicious interludes in the Huayuankou breach closure project. Just when the project is about to be completed, they either destroy your rock drilling machines or drive away your workers, and then file a series of protests. When the project encounters difficulties, they act as if nothing has happened. Recently, all parties have reached a satisfactory agreement, and the situation is calm, but whether this will last is hard to say. The peach blossom flood will arrive soon. Will the Huayuankou breach closure project be completed before the peach blossom flood? If not, must we wait for a senior general who has been sent abroad to study water conservancy to return before it can be completed?

Visit Alishan to See Taiwan's Great Forestry
Chiayi, February 11th (Airmail) – Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu – The Alishan forest has a history of 48 years since it was discovered by the Japanese in 1899. Mentioning Chiayi City in Taiwan Province immediately brings to mind the Alishan forestry, which is one of the best in the Far East. Currently, a quarter of Chiayi City's population of 120,000 directly or indirectly relies on timber harvesting, transportation, and manufacturing for their livelihoods. Large Log Storage Yard Capable of Holding 120,000 Stones of Logs The Alishan lumberyard is a place dedicated to processing logs transported down from Alishan. In the past, it belonged to the Chiayi Lumber Mill of the Taiwan Governor-General's Forestry Bureau. As early as two years before the founding of the Republic of China, the Japanese investigated forestry in the United States, considered the actual situation in Taiwan, and built a large log storage yard here, covering 52,000 square meters and capable of holding 120,000 stones of logs. All other factories are modern steel-framed concrete structures. All machinery, such as generators, high-pressure condensing rotary steam engines, pumps, and sawing machines, mostly use American products. There are also sixteen-ton mobile overhead cranes and four-ton mobile cranes manufactured by the Japanese themselves. It is divided into three departments: lumbering, repair, and log storage. The reporter, led by Deputy Director Chen Nengxin, took a tour. The original factory was destroyed in a major earthquake five years ago, and several new factories have now been built. Huge logs are transported here entirely without human labor. Once inside the lumbering area, they are quickly turned into lumber of different thicknesses and lengths under various high-speed steel saws. The monthly transportation of logs is around 15,000 stones (a stone is a log ten feet long, one foot wide, and one foot thick). The average daily lumber production is 120 stones, all of which are sold. At the same time, it also lumber for lumber merchants at a price of sixty to seventy yuan per stone. In the past, when the Japanese operated the Alishan forest, the highest production quantity for felling, collecting, loading, transporting, storing, and lumbering was around 200,000 stones. However, after the retrocession, due to the difficulty in replenishing equipment and the aging and lack of repair of various facilities, the production in 1946 was only 70,000 stones. The production in 1947 is expected to be 110,000 stones.

Area Inhabited by Indigenous People: Twenty-Year Logging Plan Deputy Director Chen pointed out several crises facing Alishan forestry: After decades of logging, Alishan has virtually no trees left to cut. Therefore, the lumberyard is now only used for collecting and transporting timber. However, the 400,000 stones of timber already felled in the mountains can be transported in just over three years based on the current transportation capacity. The artificial forests in the lumberyard's operating area will not be ready for harvesting for another ten years. Therefore, if Alishan forestry comes to a standstill three years later, it will create an unimaginable situation. Therefore, the lumberyard is now planning to extend the Alishan railway by thirty-two kilometers and penetrate into the primitive forests of the Nanzixian River area inhabited by indigenous people. The estimated area has over 1.4 million stones of timber that can be harvested for twenty years. If this can be realized, the Alishan forestry industry will not be interrupted. Recently, the lumberyard has planned to send people to negotiate with the local indigenous people and is also starting to design the laying of the tracks. We hope that this major plan, which is related to the entire forestry industry of Taiwan Province, will not fail. Secondly, the replenishment of all equipment, oil, and coal is far from sufficient. There are a total of five timber collecting machines distributed in the forest area. The Americans initially insured them for only ten years, but they have now been used for over thirty years. Cutting flesh to mend sores, the repairs are endless, and they have fallen into the most dangerous condition. The timber collecting steel cables are also wearing out and about to break. In the absence of any other solution, UNRRA used thirty-seven rolls of steel cables used in mines to replace the nineteen rolls of steel cables used for timber collecting. The effectiveness is certainly worse, and the quantity is also pitifully small. There are also no spare parts for the trains. Piecing them together, the reporter also witnessed this fact in the repair factory. The Department of Transportation wants 600,000 railway sleepers, and the Ministry of Transportation in the capital wants 1.2 million. There is more than enough lumber to supply, but if many fundamental crises are not overcome, everything will become a problem.

Seventy Li with Fifty-Three Tunnels
The Alishan railway, which embodies the great achievement of railway engineering, will surely amaze you with its grandeur once you have experienced its unique charm. This railway was initially planned by the Fujita Group of Japan in 1889. Subsequently, the Forestry Bureau followed the established policy and completed its construction in 1912. The Alishan main line from Chiayi is over seventy-one kilometers long. There are also other lines like a spider web, such as the Shuishan Line, Shuishan Branch Line, Duoduoja Line, Xiangxueshan Line, and Shishui Line, which penetrate deep into the various forest areas, with a total length of 111 kilometers. It uses narrow-gauge tracks of 760 mm and American-made steam locomotives specially designed for mountain climbing. The structure is very unique. The three cylinders are vertically aligned on one side, and the wheels are driven by gears. Each wheel has air brakes, so driving is very safe. The lumberyard currently has sixteen such locomotives in use, as well as sixteen passenger cars and 235 freight cars. They run between Chiayi and Alishan every other day, transporting workers and timber. There are also three gasoline-powered railcars and one automobile that can seat eight people for sightseeing and official use. It takes eight hours to reach Alishan by steam locomotive, and you have to pass through fifty-three tunnels. The smoke is unbearable. Deputy Director Chen specially arranged for the reporter to climb the mountain in a gasoline car. Initially, I was quite skeptical about the power of this square monster, about ten feet long and seven feet wide. However, when it sped along the tracks like a lightning bolt, I felt an unprecedented interest in it.

Qingdao Stroll
Qingdao, February 12th (Airmail) – Our Special Correspondent, Li Tian – Before arriving in Qingdao, I heard people say that Qingdao has many parks. Whether on mountain peaks, seashores, harbors, or plains, they are everywhere, with a rough estimate of at least seven or eight. After arriving, in my direct perception, this small peninsula, supported by several continuous hills and lying in the southern part of the Shandong Peninsula and the eastern part of Jiaozhou Bay, can essentially be considered a large park. In Qingdao, regardless of the main streets or narrow alleys, the roads are always smooth and clean. All architectural styles may be different, and sizes may vary, but they are all arranged in an orderly manner: milky white walls, paired with scarlet roofs, and surrounded by dense clusters of trees, from the seaside to the foot of the mountain, and from the foot of the mountain to the mountain peak. From a distance, each house is truly an ideal villa, and each street and alley seems to be a beautiful floral path. No one would imagine that this was still a wild and desolate island with lush green grass and sparse population fifty years ago (1897), and today it has become the most beautiful and poetic city in the country. Since I only had one day to stay in Qingdao, after arriving, with the assistance of President Yang Tianyi of the Minyan Daily, which has the highest circulation in the area, I first took a tour along the most prosperous Shandong Road, and then from its end, I walked along the coast towards the naval pier that extends directly into the sea, one of Qingdao's famous attractions. This naval pier, it is said, was built by Li Hongzhang. It is constructed of bluestone and a mixture of sand, lime, and clay. It was originally a place for ships to dock, but later, because the water here was shallow, large ships could not dock, so the anchorage was moved to a larger harbor, and this place was transformed from a military stronghold into a scenic area. A round pavilion was added to the end of the pier, and there are iron pillars and neat rows of seats on both sides of the pier. Braving the northerly wind in the twelfth lunar month, I walked to the end of the pier, thinking silently: This is the dead of winter. What would it be like to cool off here on a hot summer night? Continuing on, I took a car two li north of the pier to the seaside park, the essence of Qingdao and the largest park in the city. If you consider the entire Qingdao as a large park, then this place is even more of a "park of parks." The front of the park is a road, and the back is the boundless sea. The name "seaside" comes from this. Like ordinary parks, the park has pavilions and terraces, towers and halls; there are flowers and plants, and naturally there are trees. All of this seems unremarkable, but what should be particularly praised is that everything, from the smallest grass to the tallest tree, does not focus on artificial embellishment but values natural composition. Except for a magnificent and antique archway that serves as a landmark, the park has no entrances or exits, no ticket offices, and no iron gates like the parks in Shanghai. Anyone can come here to rest and visit at any time. It truly deserves to be called a "public park." I lingered here for a full hour. Finally, I walked to a large rock by the sea, looked down at the blue seawater under my feet, washing against every rock on the edge of the park, rolling into many white waves. The thoughts were touching and thought-provoking. I looked up again at the distant sea, which was connected to the distant blue sky, making me unable to distinguish who was the sky and who was the sea. Seeing this, I could not help but shout: "Beautiful Qingdao! Qingdao is too beautiful!" The nationally renowned aquarium is also located in the seaside park. I followed the direction and walked into this building that resembled a small castle. Unfortunately, except for some specimens and a small number of aquatic animals moved to greenhouses, many precious heroes of the sea died because they could not withstand the cold. The large glass tanks specially prepared for housing these heroes of the sea are now dry and without water! According to the managers, they have to wait until the turn of spring and summer, when the flowers bloom and the water warms, to capture them one by one from the sea and display them again for the public to view. Further ahead from the aquarium is the Industry Museum, which displays samples of all the products of Shandong Province. By the time I went, it was already past office hours, and I did not get a chance to see what was inside. This had already taken up half of my day. In the remaining time, I visited the Qingdao No. 1 Factory of the China Textile Company and the Central Naval Training Corps. Regarding the latter, what I found most interesting was the use and practice of radar. A friend from the Allied countries patiently demonstrated it to me and explained it to me. Due to the limited time, there are still famous scenic spots such as the battery, the seaside bathing beach, the Cangko Airport, and the racecourse, which I can only wait for a later opportunity to complete this wish! Today, the only time left is the evening. Besides visiting my colleagues here and visiting the largest private newspaper in the city, which owns a daily, an evening edition, and an English version, I only briefly browsed the Qingdao night market. On the signs of the shops, the foreign characters are written larger than the local characters. Dragon and phoenix embroidery, antiques, and calligraphy are displayed everywhere in the glass windows. From this, it is not difficult to imagine that the American Seventh Fleet stationed here has become the main target of business for the merchants here. There are also some small-footed women with traditional inland customs, wearing red satin jackets and trousers, willing to be taken by a few mischievous American sailors and parade through the streets, creating a jarring note in this beautiful city.

A Few Words on Suzhou's Public Utilities
Suzhou, March 3rd (Special Dispatch) – Special Correspondent Wu Shouren – Opening the first page of 1947, everyone has an unspoken agreement in their hearts that this year should be a year of true revival and construction. Post-war revival and construction, social needs tell us, is a multi-faceted development, including political clarity, military demobilization, rural reconstruction, economic consolidation, and people's livelihood stability. In addition to these major aspects, the growth of local public utilities, a key to maintaining social prosperity, should also be an important factor that cannot be ignored! Suzhou's public utilities, as of now, are limited to telecommunications, electricity, and public transportation. As for the problem of installing a water supply system, it is still stuck in the incubation period of design and fundraising. In terms of the development of the entire public utilities industry, we cannot deny that Suzhou is still in its infancy! Considering the identity and status of the leading county in Jiangnan, this is something that the people of Suzhou should deeply reflect on and encourage themselves to do! The reporter is writing this report on Suzhou's public utilities precisely to arouse the attention of fellow villagers both inside and outside the city, hoping that everyone will work hard to develop them in the future!

Telecommunications Industry Achieves Glorious Rebirth
Among Suzhou's three public utilities, if we were to evaluate them in order of merit, the achievements of telecommunications should be considered the best. Suzhou's telecommunications industry began in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. Initially, telegraphs and telephones were separate, and there were only over two hundred telephone subscribers. Later, as the area became more prosperous, the demand for telephones increased, and the industry expanded its scope significantly. In 1922, the number of subscribers increased to over 1,200, and the construction of a building and installation of equipment began at the current location of Qiuqifang in Suzhou. At that time, the engineers were Wang Zhijun and Zhang Zuwei, who were well-known in the telecommunications industry. After several years of management by them, it was fortunate enough to receive the title of National Model Bureau! The telegraph and telephone departments also merged in the spring of 1935. When the War of Resistance broke out and Suzhou was occupied, the enemy also saw that the telecommunications industry was the best tool for developing a place. Therefore, they specially established the "Central China Electric Communications Company" to take over the management. During those eight years, it experienced abnormal development for a time. However, this is a painful old debt. The arrogance of the Japanese technicians and the shameless decadence of the telephone operators are still etched in the minds of the old subscribers. In addition, it added a page of bribery and corruption to the history of telecommunications in China! It was not until September 1945 that society faced an epoch-making transformation. Suzhou's telecommunications industry also achieved a glorious rebirth in this transformation! The current director, Mr. Chen Tianzuo, came to Suzhou at that time as a commissioner of the Ministry of Communications to take over and was responsible for rectification. The first achievement that was felt intimately by the public was that the clear and frivolous laughter of the telephone operators could no longer be heard in the earpiece. At the same time, there was no need to strain your wrist or hoarse your throat to call out numbers. Secondly, the technicians and messengers no longer extorted alcohol money from subscribers. Furthermore, the speed with which equipment was repaired after malfunctions was also commendable! Mr. Chen Tianzuo's success in management is a fact that is unanimously acknowledged by all sectors of Suzhou. The reporter once took a leisurely tour of the Wu County Telecommunications Bureau and deeply felt that the current achievements were truly hard-earned under highly difficult material conditions.

Over One Thousand Eight Hundred Telephones Installed
The four hundred thousand residents of Suzhou City use them at any time to communicate their feelings with relatives and friends, to exchange market information with businessmen, and to contact official business between organizations. They are the nerve center for news reporters to hunt for news leads. In a large room on the second floor of the Telecommunications Bureau building in Qiuqifang Lane, eighteen local telephone exchange seats control over one thousand eight hundred telephones. Thirty-eight telephone operators sit upright and are responsible for dispatching, with each person's work area averaging more than one hundred units. The activities of their ears, mouths, eyes, and hands cannot stop for even a moment. Even in this never-ending activity, many people can connect with relatives and friends, no matter how far away, in just a few minutes. We cannot deny that this is a very great and sacred social service! In another corner of the room are four long-distance telephone exchange seats, which are also the command center for news reporters to transmit Suzhou news. Most of the operators are men, and their busyness is no less than that of the local telephone operators. When there are drastic changes in the market, they completely control the happiness or failure of merchants. In order to prevent speculators from continuously dialing and interfering with the calling time of legitimate users, Director Chen specifically stipulated that each user cannot pre-dial a second time until the first long-distance call has been connected, sweeping away the abuses that everyone had been painfully denouncing in the past. "500" is a lighthouse for Suzhou telecommunications users, and it is managed by a small specialist. When you want to find an unfamiliar number and cannot find it even after searching through the entire phone book, you can ask this lighthouse. Often, the moment you finish saying the location and name of the phone, you will immediately get a very accurate answer. Many people are often very curious and wonder how the memory of this guide is grown or trained. In fact, they have checking cards and many reference books organized by strokes, categories, serial numbers, and streets, relying entirely on flexible fingers to check out any number that anyone needs with ease. Recently, Director Chen, in view of the fact that the service scope of the inquiry station is limited to checking numbers, is still too narrow. Therefore, he is preparing to set up a service station, which will regularly report the time, answer water and land traffic procedures, and provide guidance on medical and legal matters. This facility further demonstrates the spirit of the telecommunications staff of "serving others"!

Telephone Operators' Performance Appraisal Is Very Accurate
We may have a question: The service spirit and work ethic of each person inevitably have differences in quality. How can we accurately assess who is conscientious or not when so many telephone operators are working at the same time? This question is enough to determine the reputation of the Telecommunications Bureau, and Director Chen is absolutely unwilling to ignore it. Therefore, he specially set up a monitoring station, equipped with a machine. From this machine, you can hear the responses of each telephone operator to the user and the exchange. Thus, the performance appraisal obtains a very accurate basis. However, the inherent human service spirit and work ethic are not enough to be improved solely by mandatory performance appraisals; the power of education and self-cultivation should also be incorporated. Director Chen is very clear about this point. Therefore, even though there are severe limitations in manpower and resources, he still saves money to run an amateur training class for telephone operators. Every day, all eighty operators must take turns to receive technical and spiritual training in their spare time! In the imagination of ordinary people, a kind of management that governs subordinates must mostly be considered very strict. However, the reporter's impression is that all the telephone operators not only happily accept such strict management, but also reveal their sincere love and respect for the current supervisor, Director Chen Tianzuo, everywhere! Of course, there is a factor that maintains this relationship: In short, it is Chen's meticulous care for the welfare of his colleagues. Between their superiors and subordinates, in terms of duties and work, there are indeed clearly defined boundaries and absolutely strict supervision; but in private friendship, they get along completely like family members. In the past, including before the war and during the war, whenever the employees of the Telecommunications Bureau worked the night shift in winter, they had to bring their own bedding and prepare their own tea and snacks to avoid the cold and hunger. However, now, under Director Chen's planning, several public dormitories have been set up in the bureau, with clean bedding and warm quilts, no different from home. In addition, there are publicly funded snacks, each consisting of two breads and one egg. This is truly a very warm comfort for the night shift employees who all take turns! As for the Moral Endeavor Society, bathrooms, barbershops, Moral Endeavor Flower Garden, fitness field, and other organizations and facilities, they are all unprecedented innovations in the Telecommunications Bureau. Employees enjoy these many excellent benefits that are beneficial to their bodies and minds in their spare time. No wonder they wholeheartedly love and respect this wise director.

Ten Thousand Foot Deep Ravine Dotted with Indigenous Village Huts
Having a fourteen-year-old gasoline car and a driver with eight years of experience gave me the assurance to dare to look down from the car window at the cliffs and precipices under the one hundred and fourteen bridges, the ten-thousand-foot deep ravine, although thinking about it now, I still feel a little lingering fear. The car arrived at Independent Mountain, 741 meters above sea level, which is a famous spiral railway line. The car circled higher and higher, and my nerves became tense every moment. The Zhangnaoliao Station below appeared four times in my俯瞰, shrinking each time. The train that had just left the station turned into a black snake. The dense forest covered the continuous undulating mountains and ridges, constantly sinking down from under my feet. Passing Fendihu Station, we entered the longest tunnel on the entire line, about 850 meters. The gasoline car, climbing at a speed of sixteen kilometers per hour, took a full two minutes. The gas suffocated me so much that I could hardly breathe. In fact, I suffered fifty-three suffocation's before I managed to escape from the darkness. "Duoloma", "Pingzhena", these strange station names are said to be mostly derived from indigenous languages. From here, you can indeed see many scattered small huts of the indigenous villages of Lalaqil, dotted in the deep ravines and valleys. The cliffs of Tower Mountain reflect the brilliant sunlight, giving these primitive inhabitants unlimited vitality. Arriving at Shenmu Station, 2,100 meters above sea level, the cold wind brushed my face, and I already felt a chill. Primitive large trees that could be embraced by more than a dozen people were everywhere. The so-called Divine Tree with 3,000 years of history was just a fabrication by the Japanese. In my opinion, there are many ancient trees that are more ancient than it. From here, the railway suddenly increased the slope by 60 meters per kilometer, so we had to use the N-shaped branching method to climb to the top of Alishan.

Sleeping Soundly on a Simmons Mattress at the Top of Alishan
With the Alishan lumberyard sub-yard, there is today's Alishan town, a paradise, with more than 2,000 people, all employees and their families of the lumberyard. The village houses are arranged in rows, and there are also very modern buildings. Branch Director Yang of the lumberyard cordially invited the reporter to stay at the unique "Alishan Guest House", in a VIP room with a Simmons mattress and thick carpets, which made me sleep the most novel and peaceful night's sleep at the top of the mountain at 2,250 meters above sea level. The Japanese transplanted hundreds of Yoshino cherry trees on Alishan. It is said that many tourists come to the mountain in March and April to see the cherry blossoms. Although the weather is relatively cold now and the flowers have not yet bloomed, I only feel like it is late autumn in the country. The temperature difference on Alishan is very small. The highest is about 57 degrees Fahrenheit in July, and the lowest is 40 degrees in January, with an annual average of 51 degrees. There are no mosquitoes at all. The so-called Taiwanese endemic disease—tropical malaria—does not occur here. The doctor and nurse hired by the lumberyard are idle all day long, which shows that this is indeed a healthy area. Climbing up the muddy mountain road, which had been soaked in rain and mist the night before, I visited the "Alpine Weather Station". Here, instruments are used daily to measure sunlight, temperature, air pressure, and rainfall. There are three seismographs, and the equipment is very complete. Because the person in charge was not there, there was no way to know its past history and achievements. After descending the mountain, Branch Director Yang led a tour of the small lumbering factory and repair factory here. The lumber production last year was nearly 7,000 stones, all for the lumberyard's own use. The repair factory is dedicated to assisting in the mechanical repair work for mountain operations. There are 540 employees here, and their work morale is excellent. The most workers are paid no more than 3,000 yuan, and the average salary for junior staff is calculated at a daily wage of one yuan and six jiao, with a monthly income of 2,300 yuan, plus a subsidy of 400 yuan from the lumberyard, and 300 jin of firewood (worth about 400 yuan on the market) is distributed at a price of 48 yuan. Senior staff receive the same firewood distribution, with only an additional 600 yuan subsidy. The price inflation has gradually blown to the top of the mountain, and life seems to them to be less stable than in the Japanese era, when everything was supplied by the government.

Goodbye to Alishan's Sea of Trees in a Dense Fog
Alishan also has a small school with more than 200 students, sponsored by the Wufeng Township Office. However, the teachers are owed several months of salary, and only two are left to hold the fort, with the children running around barefoot. Next to the school is a mountain museum and a small botanical garden completely planted with Alishan trees. The museum is very empty, with only specimens of flying squirrels and butterflies and models of the homes and clothing of the mountain tribes. There is also a miniature of the Wufeng Temple. The mountain tribes admire this person who sacrificed himself for righteousness. Next to it is a photograph of a round stone, which the mountain tribes regard as Wufeng's head, used as a gemstone that will never be beheaded. It is said that prayers for illness are often effective. Wufeng's seventh-generation descendant, Wu Xiao, now lives in Fanzitan in Minxiong Township and is also respected by the mountain tribes. Alishan, composed of Tertiary sedimentary rocks, is most suitable for the growth of trees. The museum has collected many tree specimens, and "Alishan's Five Trees"—cypress, hemlock, fir, cedar, and thin-barked trees—are planted at the entrance, with charts detailing the distribution of trees in the hot, warm, temperate, and cold zones. Alishan Temple is behind the museum. The quietly silent Sakyamuni Buddha does not enjoy a bit of incense. Perhaps he is also looking forward to the mountain climbing and incense offering of the cherry blossom viewers in March and April! The next morning, I said goodbye to Alishan and slipped out of the primeval forest that never sees the light of day. The spectacular sight of the great sea of clouds unfolded under my feet. Sometimes the white waves were raging, sometimes the ripples were calm. A fluffy white expanse hugged the green mountains into a small island. However, before long, a thick fog enveloped the area, obscuring the surrounding scenery to only about five feet. I anxiously told the driver to pay attention to the road. He widened his eyes and gave me an understanding reply. Without going to Alishan, I would never have imagined the power of nature. Now I began to feel the same psychological fear as when a plane encounters thick fog, but finally this fear was temporary. Alishan Scenery:

### The Overall Situation in the Northeast Has Tended Towards Stability; National Army Troops are Speeding Across the Songhua River, Repairing the Jichang Railway from Multiple Points

[Our Newspaper, Pan Chang, 5th Dispatch] The overall situation in the Northeast is tending towards stability due to the National Army's victory at the Songhua River. It is widely rumored that the National Army may capture Harbin in the middle of the month.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 5th Dispatch] (1) The National Army's advancing troops have already crossed the Songhua River and are speeding towards Wuchang, Wukeshu, and other places. (2) Since the Communist army crossed the river to invade, all areas passed through by the Communist army have suffered serious losses, especially the railways and telephone lines of Changchun, Tongdehui, Yongji, and Nong'an, which have suffered even greater and heavier losses.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th Dispatch] The battles in the outlying areas of Jichang are nearing their end. The remnants of the defeated Communist army have mostly fled back to their old nests before the offensive on February 20. However, this cannot yet be said to be the end of the battle, as the National Army has not stopped pursuing as of the 5th. Today, when the reporter met with Commander Du, he inquired about the pursuit situation at the front. He said, "We will definitely cross the Songhua River today." He did not explain whether this statement had a more active and novel meaning.

[Another Dispatch] The remnants of the Communist army, which were almost completely annihilated during the siege of Dehui, have collapsed in six routes towards Jiangbei. The central route retreated to Taolaizhao and the west city of Shuangcheng, Wujia Station, and the eastern route retreated to Xiushuidianzi, Wukeshu, Minjiatun, and other places. The National Army's pursuit troops are still searching and suppressing in all directions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th Dispatch] After the National Army in the Northeast joined forces in Dehui, the Communist army collapsed in several routes. One route retreated via Dehui towards Wukeshu and Xiushuidianzi, another route retreated via Dehui towards Taolaizhao and Wujia Station, and another route retreated from Nong'an towards Halahai.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 5th Dispatch] According to people from Harbin, the Communist army does not intend to defend Harbin firmly, and the city's supplies have been looted by the Communist army. The price of rice in Harbin is the same as in Shenyang. The Communist administrative staff has not been actively involved in liquidation struggles in the past three months. The funds needed are supplied by the Chamber of Commerce. The president of the Chamber of Commerce is Zhang Fengting, who is nearly 70 years old and the owner of Shuanghesheng, the largest flour mill in Harbin.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 5th Dispatch] The vanguard troops of the National Army in the Qitamu area north of Jilin had already reached Shanghewan, about ten kilometers northwest of Qitamu, at noon on the 5th, and are still continuing to advance.

[Central News Agency, Meihekou, 5th Dispatch] The National Army in Liuhe has made a strategic retreat towards Meihekou. They arrived in Meizhen on the morning of the 3rd and joined forces with the National Army in the town to counter the Communist army invading Meihekou.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th Dispatch] The Jichang Railway, which was destroyed by the Communist army, has begun to be repaired. The Jilin and Changchun rescue and repair engineering teams of the Ministry of Communications have arrived at Hewayazi and Longjiabao separately and are actively working day and night to rush to repair this arduous project of 48 kilometers. The mountain cave of Tumenling, the large iron bridge of Yinma River, and more than fifty bridges of various sizes are all major projects on the Jichang Road.

### Post-War Inspection of Dehui Shows Bullet Marks Everywhere

[Central News Agency, Dehui, 4th Dispatch] The press corps came here on the 4th for an inspection. The first impression after arriving here was that the houses inside and outside the city were badly damaged, with bullet marks everywhere. Commander Pan Yukun's headquarters was close to the station. The water tower on the station was high in the air and conspicuous, so the area near the headquarters was hit particularly hard, and the doors and windows of the headquarters were all destroyed. The reporter met with Generals Sun Liren and Pan Yukun here successively. General Sun held a press conference at 6 pm tonight. It is said that the Communist army collapsed in six routes towards the north bank of the Songhua River, and we are pursuing them fiercely. The front has reached the bridgehead on the river bank. After Sun described the situation of the Communist army fleeing in separate routes, he said: The Communist army's strategy seems to have changed. In the past, they focused on harassment across a wide area, but now they focus on point-to-point attacks. There are still scattered remnants in Jiangnan, which can be cleared. According to General Pan, the four battalions of his troops began to engage in outer battles with the invading Communist army on the 21st of last month. By the 26th, the focus shifted to the suburbs, and the battle was the fiercest on the evening of the 27th. At 2 am on the 28th, a regiment of the Communist army attacked into Liudao Street from the southwest corner of the city, and was annihilated by the mature and fierce crossfire network formed by the garrison troops in our various strongholds. The Communist army that attacked the city numbered about 30,000, firing 50,000 to 80,000 shells. Our army killed or wounded about 15,000 Communist soldiers and destroyed three Communist tanks. We only lost 500 soldiers. The city had abundant pre-stored food and ammunition, and a large amount of food has not been used so far. According to captured Communist soldiers, the old Eighth Route Army soldiers are very tired of fighting, while the newly recruited ones are driven as cannon fodder. Lin Biao ordered the capture of Dehui within four days, and the Communist army even declared, "If we can't capture Dehui, we won't fight anymore from now on." Many Communist soldiers from the Northeast oppose Lin Biao. It is heard that Mao Zedong arrived in Jiamusi on the 15th of last month and launched this offensive on the 20th. According to reports obtained here, seven railway bridges from Mishazi to Dehui were destroyed, 35 kilometers of steel rails and telephone lines were damaged, the water towers at Mishazi and Buhai stations were destroyed, 400 houses in Mishazi were burned, and the losses of railway and highway materials in Meiba were heavy.

### Zhao Jiaxiang's Speech

The Air Force Takes the Top Spot in the Victory in Changji

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 5th Dispatch] Zhao Jiaxiang said that the Air Force took the top spot in the victory in the Changshikou battle this time, because the Air Force's reconnaissance of the Communist army's troop movements was extremely detailed, and it was also very effective in preventing the Communist army from advancing.
