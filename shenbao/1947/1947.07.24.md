### Wedemeyer Visited the Chairman Yesterday, Visited Our Military and Political Leaders in the Afternoon, The U.S. Side is Studying the Provided Information

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 23rd] The 23rd marked the official commencement of General Wedemeyer's activities in Nanjing. He spent the majority of the morning in meetings at the U.S. Embassy. Attending were Minister Stuart, Admiral Cooke, and senior officials from the U.S. Military Advisory Group in the Embassy's Military Attaché Office. During the meeting, in addition to the information collected under the Minister's guidance, the Ambassador offered his personal insights gained from years of experience in China, which Wedemeyer greatly valued. At 10:00 AM, the Minister accompanied Wedemeyer and his interpreter to meet Chairman Chiang and his wife, for a discussion lasting approximately one hour. At noon, Wedemeyer and Cooke dined with the Minister. At 2:30 PM, Wedemeyer, still accompanied by the Minister, paid a visit to President Zhang, holding discussions for over twenty minutes. Wang Yunwu and Weng Wenhao were also present. Subsequently, he visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, speaking for eighteen minutes, followed by a visit to Defense Minister Bai Lexi and Chief of Staff Chen Cheng at the Ministry of National Defense. In the evening, he and the Minister attended a private dinner hosted by Chairman Chiang and his wife at their official residence. The photograph shows Chairman Chiang shaking hands with General Wedemeyer during their meeting (taken by Hu Chongxian of the Lixingshe).

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 23rd] Watson, the press liaison for General Wedemeyer's delegation, told reporters on the evening of the 23rd that they were busy all day. The morning's meeting only covered the review of a portion of the acquired information. On the 24th, they will continue to study the information gathered by the Embassy and the U.S. Army and Navy in China. They have received a small portion of the reports provided by the Chinese government but have not yet had the opportunity to examine them. Watson declined to answer questions regarding the extent to which their investigation and evaluation would influence U.S. policy toward China, stating that their mission was solely to investigate and evaluate the current situation in China and Korea, and to submit a report to President Truman. Beyond that, he could not comment. The delegation's mission does not focus on any specific matter, as China's current difficulties are the result of a complex interplay of factors. They will visit every region they should and can visit. The truth about the Beitashan incident is also under investigation. If the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, or even the Communist Party can provide information or opinions beneficial to the overall situation, they will study them all. They will meet with a number of individuals, but as of now, there is no intention to enter the Communist areas. The delegation's plan of action for on-site investigations will be determined after sufficient study of the available information, possibly in early next week. At that time, each expert will begin their individual work.

[United Press, Nanjing, 23rd] A spokesman for General Wedemeyer stated that the group will travel to Shanghai this week to discuss matters with American commercial organizations.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Admiral Cooke, Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on the morning of the 23rd to visit U.S. Ambassador Stuart and General Wedemeyer, the newly arrived special envoy of the U.S. President, and returned to Shanghai in the afternoon.

[Local News] Admiral Cooke will inspect the operations of the U.S. Navy's various institutions in the city today.

### U.S. Republican Congressman Broadcasts, Advocates Assisting Our Country in Suppressing Rebellion, Dong XianGuang Talks About Wedemeyer's Mission to China

[Our Report] San Francisco, 23rd Broadcast: U.S. Republican Senator Brewster, in a broadcast speech in Washington, advocated extending the Marshall Plan to the Middle East and the Far East, especially to China. He stated, "If China falls into the hands of the Communists, our efforts in Europe will be in vain." He also said, "The United States should assist Chairman Chiang in quelling the Communist rebellion. We cannot pursue one policy in Greece and another policy in China." Senator Taft, Chairman of the Senate Policy Committee, said in the same broadcast that a year and a half ago, when Marshall was sent to China as an envoy, he had strongly urged Chairman Chiang to negotiate with the Communist Party and make concessions to the Soviet Union according to the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. Now, however, our country's policy toward China has changed, and I hope to continue to maintain this policy that has already changed.

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] The U.S. government hinted on the 23rd that what the Wedemeyer delegation is paying attention to during its investigation of the situation in China is how to find ways to complete a new or stable currency reform and how to reduce the large amount of military surplus, which would be conducive to the recovery of the Chinese economy.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Executive Yuan's Information Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 23rd. Director Dong Xianguang answered reporters' questions as follows: Question: It is rumored that the basic salary of civil servants will be adjusted from August, doubling it. Is this true? Answer: This statement is not accurate. Question: Are there any new developments regarding the Dalian issue? Answer: There are no new developments. Question: Is it possible that the Chairman will go to Lushan this summer? Answer: As of now, the Chairman has no plans to go to Lushan. Question: What is General Wedemeyer's mission to China this time? Can the Director provide any clarification on this? Answer: General Wedemeyer's visit to China will certainly enable our government to further understand American opinions, just as he will help the American government understand the situation in China. General Wei's mission to investigate the facts is to promote mutual understanding between China and the United States. The Chinese government will do its utmost to assist General Wei in achieving this task.

### Our Authorities Will Provide Economic, Political, Military and Other Information

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] Chinese officials have prepared a large number of documents, charts, and tables to present to Wedemeyer, including those describing the increasingly tense Sino-Soviet relations, including the Soviet army's removal of industrial equipment in the Northeast, the transfer of a large number of Kwantung Army munitions to the Chinese Communists, and the occupation of Lushun and Dalian, endangering China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Regarding the economy, Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Commission, will be responsible for providing Wedemeyer with all the information the United States needs. He will also explain several construction projects that would be impossible to start without American material assistance. Regarding politics, Wedemeyer will be informed of the necessity of the recent general mobilization order, and it will be emphasized that the current government's foundation has indeed been expanded, including the Democratic Party, the Youth Party, and some non-party members. The government's "democratization" plan for general elections in October and constitutional governance in December has been severely hindered by the Chinese Communists. Chinese military authorities will submit lengthy reports on the military situation in order to seek American assistance and shorten the time required to suppress the rebellion.

### Peng Xuepei Arrives in Dihua

### Welcoming Wedemeyer in a Sweat, The Capital's Unprecedented Heat in Seventy Years

— Our Correspondent Yu Zhenji

[Nanjing, 22nd] General Wedemeyer's third visit to China coincides with Nanjing's unprecedented heat in seventy years. The outdoor temperature is as high as over 100 degrees, and the red line on the thermometer continues to rise. The welcomers waiting at the airport on the Dajiaochang Airport have their clothes soaked through countless times. Even Song Ziwen, who arrived at four o'clock, immediately took off his coat as soon as he got out of the car, and his snow-white shirt was completely soaked with sweat. The strangest thing is that Ambassador Stuart was still wearing a thick woolen hat on such a hot day, and sweat was dripping down. Many people were afraid that the old man would not be able to stand it.

General Wedemeyer, who was originally said to arrive at four o'clock, did not arrive until 5:20 PM. Those who had been waiting at the airport for a long time had been waiting for more than three hours. Before Wedemeyer got off the plane, many people were guessing what clothes Wedemeyer would wear today, but few guessed that he would wear civilian clothes. His tall figure, blue suit, and red face, especially with a "futuristic" tie, made him look more like a diplomat than a famous military strategist.

General Wedemeyer left China only in April last year. This time, he revisited this land only one year and three months apart. Revisiting the old place made him feel more親切. After getting off the plane, the first person to greet him was Ambassador Stuart. Old friends reunited and exchanged greetings, which was indescribably 親切. The photographers took many hours of photos during this opportunity. Then, Director Ling Qihan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs introduced Wedemeyer to the welcomers one by one. When he was introduced to Song Ziwen, they shook hands and both exclaimed "Ha!" When Wedemeyer first arrived in Chongqing, Song had greeted him as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and they had been very close ever since. Old friends reunited, and they held hands tightly. Wedemeyer also said very affectionately: "Long time no see, how are you." Then he introduced Minister Yu, Minister Bai, Chief of Staff Chen, Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui, etc. Everyone was an old friend, so when they greeted him, they all said: "We meet again, how are you," or "I am very happy to meet this time." When introducing Sun Liren and other famous generals of the anti-Japanese war, many people had worked with Wedemeyer in Shanghai or had worked under him. Before shaking hands, they saluted first, which made General Wedemeyer, who was wearing civilian clothes, wonder whether to return the salute or shake hands? One person who was more Americanized simply said: "OSBS, long time no see, how are you." Of course, there were also some new friends, such as Mayor Shen Yi.

After the introductions, they were about to inspect the honor guard. A foreign photographer suggested taking some close-up shots, so they asked Ambassador Stuart and Wedemeyer to act like they were talking cordially. Wedemeyer and the officials of our government took a group photo, and finally asked Wedemeyer and Minister Wu Wen to shake hands and take a group photo. The two faced each other and had to exchange a few words. Wu said in a humorous tone: "It's very hot today," which made everyone laugh.

After the photographers were satisfied, the ceremony of inspecting the honor guard began. When Wedemeyer, who was at least a head taller than the tallest member of the honor guard, walked past the soldiers, I believe he must have thought of the scene when he was training soldiers in Yunnan.

We have welcomed and sent off many people on the Dajiaochang. Here, we have welcomed senior government personnel who returned to the capital after 复员, we have welcomed and sent off Special Envoy Marshall, and we have also sent off the delegation of the Chinese Communists. Each welcome or send-off represents the beginning or end of a political stage. Today, we have come to welcome General Wedemeyer, the special envoy of President Truman, which represents the beginning of a new era. We congratulate Wedemeyer on the success of this trip.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] The war in southern Jilin has gone from tense to stable in the past 36 hours. After the National Army on the Jilin-Haining Road retreated to the Shuangyang Highlands and the strategic strongholds in its southern suburbs to await an opportunity to advance, Shuanghe Town, which had undergone several tug-of-war battles, has become a military vacuum. This is because the 共匪 has sensed the shaking of the Meihekou stronghold and the double crisis of going deep into the ambush, and only uses small groups to harass the villages and towns on both sides of the Jilin-Haining Road. The railway on the northern section of the Jilin-Haining Road between Jilin and Xiyang is operating as usual.

[Our Correspondent in Yanzhou, 23rd] The 共匪 in southwestern Shandong are in a state of exhaustion and fleeing in panic after the National Army's various generals divided up their forces to encircle and suppress them. Among them, after the 共匪 outside Tengxian, Zouxian, and Yanzhou in the Xuzhou-Yanzhou section east of the Jinpu Railway were cleared by the National Army, the remnants of Chen Yi's troops fled to the Phoenix Mountain and Nieshan areas on the border of the four counties of Si, Zou, Fei, and Teng, attempting to sneak back into the Yimeng Mountain area.

[Our Correspondent in Linyi, 23rd] The 共匪's Ninth Column, which attempted to sneak into Nanma, has been defeated by the National Army, with a loss of at least one brigade. In addition, three other columns have also suffered considerable losses. Starting on the 23rd, the National Army on the Nanma and Linqu routes are continuing to attack.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 23rd] The war between Anhui and Henan is quiet. There are only more than 400 bandits in the city of Boxian, led by the puppet county magistrate Feng Dunzi. There are not many 共匪 in the city of Luyi. The main force of Wei Fenglou's troops, more than 1,000 people, is north of Huaidian, with unclear intentions.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 23rd] The 共匪 in western Shandong have begun a general retreat. There was a fierce battle in Jining on the 22nd all night. The 共匪 attacked the city 12 times and were wiped out more than 8,000 people. On the morning of the 23rd, the bandits could not support themselves and collapsed and retreated. The defending army followed and wiped them out, and recovered Daizhuang and Yangshanjie, which are three kilometers north of the city. The National Army's counterattack continued to achieve great victories, killing and wounding more than 5,000 bandits, including one column commander, a chief of staff, and 53 staff officers. The National Army in Wenshang wiped out more than 1,000 bandits on the 22nd. Commander-in-chief Yao Wu went to Taian to see a doctor on the 23rd. The Shandong situation is about to undergo a complete change.

### The Sino-Changchun Railway was Destroyed by Bandits, Causing a Loss of 10 Billion Circulation Coupons

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] During the fifth offensive by the bandit army in northern Songhua, the steel rails and sleepers of the Changwan section of the Sino-Changchun Railway were destroyed. The total value is estimated to be more than 10 billion yuan in circulation coupons. It is estimated that the railway, which is about 185 kilometers long from the north of Siping to Mengjiatun in the south of Kaiyuan, including 438,270 sleepers, 1,759 tons of steel rails, 4,627 telephone poles, and 19 station buildings and railway buildings along the line, were all blown up or burned down. According to the person in charge of the Sino-Changchun Railway here, in addition to searching for the materials needed to repair the damaged railway in the local area of Northeast China, a large number of sleepers have also been ordered from Taiwan.

### The U.S. Transferred Surplus Materials to Our Country, Totaling Nearly 500 Million U.S. Dollars, Washington Officially Announced

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The China and East Asia Office of the U.S. Foreign Liquidation Commission announced today that it has supplied China with approximately 170 million U.S. dollars worth of surplus materials, which is different from the report on May 31 this year. A State Department spokesman explained that the statement was in response to Ye Gongchao's statement, who said on June 4 that China had only received 20 million U.S. dollars worth of surplus materials, most of which were non-military trucks. The official statement said that the transfer was made in accordance with the terms of the large-scale sale stipulated in the August 30, 1946 agreement. Before signing the agreement, the U.S. government had transferred surplus materials worth approximately 324 million U.S. dollars to China at cost. The 500 million U.S. dollars worth of materials include various equipment, including trucks, construction equipment, clothing, food, and medicines, but aircraft, combat materials, ships, and other naval equipment are not included. These materials are located in mainland China and 17 islands in the Pacific Ocean (including Okinawa and Guam). By the end of May, the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau had obtained 59.7 million U.S. dollars worth of surplus materials. Due to transportation problems and various procedures, the speed at which the Chinese side accepted the materials was slower than that announced by the Liquidation Committee. This procedure has long been determined, and a large number of materials have already been transferred to China, but the speed of this transfer is now greatly increasing. According to this procedure, the transfer procedure is expected to be completed within the 22 months stipulated in the agreement.

### Economic Reform Plan Full Text (Continued from Yesterday's Second Edition)

2.  Industry: Without rapidly building an industrial base, China's economy will not easily become sound. However, China's economy is based on agriculture, so without a self-sufficient people's livelihood industry to protect agriculture and ensure that agriculture and industry exchange and complement each other, the foundation of China's economy cannot be established. Therefore, the current development of people's livelihood industries should be combined with the equal importance of basic industries as an urgent plan. Therefore, the government urgently needs to improve the industrial environment, protect industrial profits, and ensure that funds are available and loans are convenient. At the same time, it should formulate a comprehensive plan and predetermine the annual output, and complete it in stages with the combined efforts of the government and the people. The methods are:

(1) Industry should first meet the needs of the rural areas. All industries related to water conservancy construction, engineering, chemicals, fertilizers, agricultural tools, and transportation equipment manufacturing should be planned and implemented first.

(2) In the initial stage of industrial development, emphasis should be placed on: (1) developing fuel and power, (2) developing various minerals, (3) producing cement and other construction materials, and (4) establishing machinery manufacturing factories to lay the foundation for industry.

(3) People's livelihood industries should start with the five major categories of food, clothing, housing, transportation, and printing. We should first focus on the existing foundation and give priority to the development of the textile industry, the food industry, and the mechanical and chemical industries related to the five categories of industries.

(4) Regarding the scope of state-owned and private enterprises. In accordance with the First Phase Economic Construction Principles and Industrial Construction Guidelines Implementation Principles, classify and divide areas, briefly specify, and urge implementation.

(5) Industrial construction areas should be planned as a whole by the central government based on national economic conditions, transportation conditions, and resource distribution.

(6) The government should support and improve small industries (especially handicrafts) and their intermediary organizations, and enable the people to make full use of their spare time to engage in industrial production to meet domestic and international needs.

(7) In order to develop international trade and increase exports, the production of exported minerals, handicrafts, and processed agricultural products should be increased.

(8) The manufacturing of industrial products should strive for standardization.

(9) The government should organize and promote the establishment of various industrial and mining construction projects and investment companies to invest long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects, and use overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange assets deposited abroad to invest in this organization to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad.

(10) Industrial and mining companies should be allowed to circulate their stocks in the market, and should be allowed to issue bonds, so that idle funds in the market can fully participate in legitimate production projects.

(11) Bank loans to industrial and mining enterprises should be supervised to ensure that they are actually used for production collateral, and fixed assets such as factory buildings and machinery should be accepted, not limited to raw materials and finished products.

(12) The fixed assets of industrial and mining enterprises should be allowed to be revalued and the capital adjusted when necessary.

(13) In order to promote the development of industry, the government should clearly define measures to encourage foreign investment and technical cooperation.

(14) Wages should strive to be reasonable in order to stabilize production order and enable labor and management to work together to increase production.

3.  Commerce: Trade deficit is a major disease of the national economy. The government should encourage exports with effective methods in order to gradually balance foreign trade. As for the stagnation of domestic commercial transportation and the heavy taxes, both can prevent goods from flowing smoothly, and market materials are becoming increasingly scarce, and commerce is becoming increasingly depressed. It is urgent to remove restrictions, encourage and punish, so that commerce can quickly return to normal. The methods are:

(1) Domestic trade should make full use of the coordination of financial institutions and the convenience of water, land, and air transportation to stimulate trade and promote the use of domestic goods to increase the total volume of trade in the country and promote balanced development.

(2) In international trade, imports should be strictly restricted as much as possible, except for production tools, raw materials, books, and instruments, in order to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditures.

(3) Export affairs should be given encouragement. The government may purchase materials to facilitate exports, or designate certain items to be operated by import and export, so as to increase exports to offset imports.

(4) Assign the National Cooperative Goods Distribution Office to contact the International Cooperative Trade Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance and the National Wholesale Cooperative, and try the barter system at appropriate times.

(5) Strengthen the organization of industry associations to improve commercial technology, improve commercial ethics, and promote the implementation of the government's price control policies.

4.  Transportation: The transportation industry is a prerequisite for economic construction. After years of hard work before the war, it had already taken shape. However, after the long-term war of resistance and the destruction by the communist bandits, half of it was destroyed. In the future, the government and the people should work together according to the division of labor, and do their best to restore and develop the transportation industry, then the current phenomenon of economic paralysis can be greatly changed. The methods are:

(1) In addition to the railway lines planned and announced by the central government, local and private operations may be permitted and encouraged under the system established by the central government.

(2) In addition to the national highways planned, announced, and built by the central government, all others shall be permitted and encouraged for local and private operations under the standards set by the central government.

(3) Airports shall be operated by the government. After the preparations for airway construction, station equipment, and flight control are completed, private operations shall be encouraged as much as possible for air transport.

(4) The main waterways shall be dredged by the central government, the branch lines shall be dredged by the provinces, and the smallest branch lines shall be dredged by the counties. The important ports shall be operated by the central government, and the secondary ports shall be operated by the cities. All waterways and ports operated by the provinces and cities shall be assisted by the central government with financial and human resources. Shipping shall be encouraged for private operation as much as possible.

(5) Telegraphs shall be operated by the central government. Wireless stations specially needed for aviation and shipping in the sea and air shall be allowed to be set up by themselves under the management of the central government.

(6) Long-distance telephone trunk lines and inter-provincial lines shall be laid by the central government, and branch lines within each province shall be laid by the provinces, but shall not be parallel to the trunk lines or inter-provincial lines (the division of trunk lines and branch lines shall be determined by the central government), and county and township branch lines shall be laid by the counties.

(7) City telephones, except for those in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan and provincial cities, which shall be handled or publicly operated by the central government, shall be encouraged for private operation in other counties, and measures shall be formulated to allow them to be connected to long-distance telephones.

(8) The government shall do its best to supervise and encourage the construction of various transportation projects and the manufacturing of transportation equipment. (The following text continues on the second edition)

### Sino-British Air Transport Agreement Signed. Each Side Approved Seven Air Routes. Sino-Siamese Civil Aviation Draft Treaty Also Signed Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The air transport agreement between the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, together with the attached documents and exchanges of notes, was formally signed at noon on the 23rd at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Minister Wang Shijie and British Ambassador to China Sir Stephen Stevenson, representing the two governments. The main text of the agreement was negotiated in accordance with the standard method adopted by the Chicago International Civil Aviation Conference on December 7, 1946.

### Full Text of Economic Reform Plan (Continued from above) (First Edition)

V. Increase Production of Materials and Stabilize Prices: Currently, there is a shortage of materials and price fluctuations. The government urgently needs to increase production through economic methods and make appropriate use of them to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices. The measures are as follows:

(1) The government should provide agricultural production loans and adopt a procurement approach to promote the production of major agricultural raw materials such as rice, wheat, cotton, and soybeans, and utilize a portion or a large part of them.

(2) The government should supply raw materials to manufacturers, or provide industrial production loans, or adopt a procurement approach to promote the production of flour, cloth, oil, sugar, fuel, and other daily necessities, and utilize a portion or a large part of them.

(3) The government should provide export loans or adopt a procurement approach to promote the production and export of export products such as soybeans, raw silk, mineral sands, tung oil, hides and furs, tea, and pig bristles, in order to enrich foreign exchange reserves.

(4) In addition to the government's planned supply of daily necessities to military personnel and public educators, the surplus materials should be used for rationing and stabilizing prices according to the needs of cities, so that hoarding is impossible and the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods can be achieved.

(5) The government should negotiate loans of machinery and raw materials from foreign countries on preferential terms to increase the supply of materials.

(6) Enemy and puppet industrial and mining equipment in the country and factory equipment dismantled and returned from Japan as compensation, except for those necessary for state-owned enterprises, should be sold or leased as much as possible to capable and experienced private factories to restore and increase production as soon as possible.

(7) Interest rates exceeding the prescribed maximum rate of usury will not be protected and will be punished.

(8) Strictly crack down on speculation and manipulation in accordance with the National Mobilization Law.

(C) Regarding Finance

As production enterprises expand, fiscal revenue will naturally increase proportionally. The government should use effective methods to protect and support agricultural production to increase land tax revenue, protect and support industrial production to increase direct and commodity tax revenue, protect and support trade to increase customs revenue, and protect and support the salt industry to increase salt tax revenue, using the production capacity and total income of all the people to support the entire national finance. As for the various aspects of financial reform, they can be included in the two tasks of reorganizing finance and stabilizing the currency value. The detailed measures are listed below:

I. Reorganizing Finance:

(1) The financial revenue and expenditure system should be revised to increase provincial-level financial resources to achieve self-sufficiency. The statutory taxes of counties and cities should also be thoroughly reorganized, and illegal apportionments should be strictly prohibited, so that local finances can develop soundly and meet the needs of local construction.

(2) The tax rates of direct, commodity, customs, and salt taxes should be carefully adjusted according to the people's ability to pay taxes, in order to increase national treasury revenue and equalize the people's burden.

(3) New taxes should be opened up in accordance with the principle of "those with money should contribute" to meet the needs of national construction.

(4) Adjust the collection agencies, strictly control tax sources, and improve collection procedures to strengthen tax administration efficiency and reduce collection costs.

(5) Enemy and puppet industries and surplus materials should be sold quickly. State-owned enterprises that do not need to be operated by the government should be sold to private enterprises by issuing stocks or other means.

(6) Implement a public debt policy to absorb idle funds to make up for the gap between fiscal revenue and expenditure.

(7) Give priority to allowing people to apply to the Central Bank for foreign exchange with gold for the purpose of purchasing permitted imported goods.

(8) Determine the existence or abolition of agencies based on the needs of national construction. Overly large institutions must be streamlined; redundant institutions must be merged.

(9) Expenditures that are not urgently needed by the state and are not conducive to production and construction must be saved and stopped.

II. Stabilizing the Currency Value:

(1) The government should actively increase revenue and strictly limit unnecessary expenditures to gradually reduce the gap between fiscal revenue and expenditure, so as to control the amount of issuance.

(2) Use effective methods to delay the turnover rate of currency.

(3) The government should be fully prepared and choose an appropriate time to reorganize the currency system. The current special currency systems in Northeast China, Taiwan, and other regions should also be reorganized at the same time to achieve uniformity.

(4) Strengthen foreign exchange control and absorb overseas remittances to enrich foreign exchange reserves.

(5) The government should allow people to use gold to purchase state-owned production enterprises and enemy and puppet industries sold by the government to increase the reserve of legal currency.

(6) The assets of Chinese citizens abroad should be declared within a time limit and used properly.

Conclusion

In short, production enterprises cannot be without the nourishment of finance for a day, and fiscal revenue cannot be without the support of production enterprises for a day. Financial policy, economic policy, and fiscal policy are mutually causal and mutually supportive, and cannot be separated even for a moment. The provisions in this plan that have been implemented by the government but have not yet taken effect should be strengthened by the competent departments; those that should be implemented immediately and prepared for implementation should be assigned by the Executive Yuan to the competent departments to formulate detailed measures and implement them immediately. Secondly, in order to maximize the benefits of the implementation of this plan, three points should be especially noted: First, the treatment of military personnel and public educators should be reasonably resolved so that they can maintain a minimum necessary life, so that administrative efficiency can be improved. Second, state-owned enterprises and private enterprises should be on an equal footing, without any discrimination, and especially without giving special treatment to some private enterprises, which would increase difficulties for legitimate private businesses. Third, a broad economic construction movement should be launched in the social sphere to improve public understanding and interest in the economy, and the difficulties of economic construction should be eliminated with the cooperation of officials and the people. If the above-mentioned reform measures can be carried out in coordination, the current situation of economic recession, soaring prices, dwindling tax sources, and unbalanced income can be changed immediately. It is hoped that there will be many producers and few consumers, quick workers and comfortable users, so that wealth will always be sufficient, and the crisis in finance and economy can be saved. (End)

### Editorial: A Discussion on the Adoption of the Ordering System

—One of the Reviews of the Economic Reform Plan

Regarding the matters of increasing production and stabilizing prices, the original plan of the Executive Yuan's economic reform has provisions for promoting agriculture, industry, and commerce through loans or adopting ordering methods; and the amendment of the Economic Commission has not modified this. Once this plan is passed by the State Council, all industries belonging to agriculture, industry, and export will have the possibility of implementing this purchasing method on a large scale.

The so-called ordering method, its implementation methods, still need to be formulated separately. Its meaning and scope are currently impossible to grasp. Judging by intention, it should be no more than following the precedents of raw silk and frozen eggs, designating institutions to specialize in purchasing. Its meaning is equivalent to bulk ordering, and it is very likely that a certain percentage of the payment will be made in advance to facilitate turnover; however, the scope is larger, and the percentage may be higher. There are ten advantages to using this method:

I. The payment is conditional on the delivery of physical goods, so it cannot be arbitrarily diverted to speculation and hoarding;

II. Since it is conditional on the delivery of physical goods, it seems to be able to promote production effectively;

III. If the manufacturer sells the goods in advance, as long as the calculation is accurate in advance, there is no loss;

IV. Because the goods delivered are physical goods, and they are the products produced by the other party, there is no unexpected risk for the ordering agency;

V. It is possible to obtain unexpected benefits due to the rise in prices;

VI. The state can grasp a large amount of materials and can use them to stabilize prices;

VII. These materials can also be used to promote the rationing policy;

VIII. Since the manufacturer has sold the goods in advance, they can be relieved of concerns about unsalable or falling prices;

IX. If it belongs to export products, all procedures and profits and losses related to export can be borne by the purchasing agency, which has nothing to do with the exporter;

X. If it is agreed to deliver the goods at the factory or on the spot, the manufacturer can ignore the labor costs such as transportation, water freight, insurance, and warehousing.

The above ten points refer specifically to the advantages of the ordering aspect; the reverse side also has shortcomings or concerns, which are listed below:

According to normal theory, the so-called ordering price cannot but adopt the method of agreement. There must always be one party willing to buy and one party willing to sell; only then can the transaction be successfully concluded. However, judging from examples, all government purchases of materials often unintentionally carry a few unreasonable colors; making producers have to make compromises under certain circumstances in order to comply with the conditions it offers. The prices of cotton yarn purchases in the past, as well as the prices of silkworm cocoons and cotton, have all escaped this example. Therefore, the people who handle the purchase also often try to be fair and reasonable and prevent farmers from suffering too much. Now, if we carry out various ordering on a large scale, will it be too suppressed, making producers unable to reproduce? Farmers, with no profit to be made, would rather let the fields be barren? This is one.

When the government sells materials, such as gold, cloth, sugar, and coal, its prices often follow the black market, giving people the criticism of leading price increases. If a large amount of materials are received through ordering, then the quantity of materials it grasps is even greater, and the scope of its operation is even wider; the result is, does it stabilize prices? Or is it leading price increases? This also remains to be proven by facts. This is two.

Government-run businesses must pay attention to various procedures; the bigger the thing, the more complicated it is, and the heavier the delay. In the past, many enemy and puppet materials and relief materials became moldy and unusable because of these reasons. Taking that as an example, I am afraid that no one dares to guarantee that they will not repeat this mistake in the future. This is three.

The so-called ordering method may have to start from mass production and special products, which is indeed unavoidable due to technical and strength conditions. If the ordering method is held at the same time as other methods (such as various types of loans now), there is no problem. If, after this plan is implemented, various loans are restricted and this ordering method is emphasized, then production enterprises with a smaller scope and various products not within the ordering scope will inevitably be affected. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, requesting it to carefully consider the matter of stopping commercial lending and not implement it; it can be seen that its relationship is significant. This is four.

All large-scale purchases are very likely to create a monopoly phenomenon; making it impossible for other aspects to compete or share the profits with it. Not long ago, we heard that many small oil factories in the interior had already encountered this problem with a certain kind of oil-making raw material. Recently, silk merchants have also requested to retain 20%. After this ordering method is widely promoted, how to plan to take care of both sides and prevent producers outside these scopes from being affected by various disadvantages is also worth studying. This is five.

Whether it is raw materials or finished products, there must be many intermediate merchants between them before they reach retailers or consumers. They move, match, deposit, and distribute in the middle, each fulfilling its task of transshipment. Although most of these tasks are interpreted as exploitation, profiteering, speculation, and hoarding, it is okay to eliminate them as much as possible, but the number of people who make a living by this and engage in this business is also quite a lot. At a time when there are many unemployed and life is difficult, the result of direct purchase and sale adds many unemployed people, making them unable to operate. From the perspective of the entire society, this cannot be said to be a serious problem. This is six.

The worst losses are still the majority of farmers, because their units are too small, their output is limited, and they are still unable to use various cooperative mutual aid organizations. As the preamble to the amendment says, the agricultural loans of various banks are currently very small and do not help, which is indeed the case. Therefore, in terms of agricultural products, the so-called benefits of loans and ordering cannot be obtained by farmers. This is seven. Finally, we must talk about the issue of ordering itself, which is the issue of currency supply. Many people think that raising money by printing machines, how much is needed, seems to be no need to worry about. In fact, printing machines also have their own factual limitations, and they are not予取予求, can be whatever you want. It is heard that this serious problem was encountered during the recent cocoon collection, which caused a lot of trouble. If the ordering method is widely adopted, the amount of cash required will be considerable. Regardless of whether the supply can be sufficient, whether the agricultural, industrial, and export industries can each get what they need and satisfy their wishes; but after the currency continues to expand, can prices be stabilized? If there is too much concern and too much caution, will the effectiveness of this ordering method in promoting the agricultural, industrial, and export industries be greatly reduced! This is eight.

Everything has its advantages and disadvantages, and there is no abacus in the world that is completely satisfactory. This plan has many advantages and has been carefully considered. As long as the State Council approves it, it can be implemented. We naturally hope that it will be promoted smoothly and can achieve the maximum effect of increasing the production of materials and stabilizing materials. However, the hidden worries and the thorns ahead must also be carefully prevented and prepared for early. For example, when a doctor uses medicine, the possible reactions should be considered in advance and minimized as much as possible, so as not to cause accidents. Fortunately, the plan sets only a principle: Which industries and products must be ordered first? What is the limit of the ordering? What are the conditions? What will be done after the ordering? How to take care of those who are not prepared to order? We believe that the government must have detailed considerations and a complete set of plans for these technical issues. Because this is a fundamental national plan, it is different from the expedient measures of dealing with things as they come in the past; it will never be fragmented, "only paying attention to the remedy of temporary difficulties"; and it will never just make small calculations, focusing solely on profit and loss.

Bollaert said: "I sincerely hope for understanding. If I do not receive a response from the Viet Minh, then I have decided to end the current situation. Colonialism is already dead, and France does not want it to exist again. If I can obtain the full trust of the government and parliament, I will be prepared to formulate a charter for the future of Vietnam. But before we begin proposing work, the current senseless guerrilla warfare must stop. My contention is purely political in nature, and only when the conflict ceases will there be room for calm discussion. In other words, in the end there will be no victors and no conquered. By recruiting parties from all factions, we will establish lasting peace. Without this peace, the Vietnamese people will have no freedom or prosperity. Due to the misfortune of the Vietnamese people, we will give our full friendship. As for the Free Government of South Vietnam, the French government hopes that it will remain provisional in nature."

### London and Rangoon Simultaneously Announce This Morning: Britain Transfers Power to Burma; Thakin Nu Continues Previous Cabinet Policy

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Reliable sources report: The British and Burmese governments may issue a statement on the transfer of power to Burma simultaneously on Thursday morning. It is expected that legislation regarding the transfer of power to Burma will be submitted to the British Parliament between October and December. Political figures say that after the Burmese massacre, some in Burma believed that Britain would use this incident as an excuse to delay the transfer of power to Burma. The simultaneous statement by the British and Burmese governments should help clarify this suspicion.

It is heard that after the establishment of the Burmese government led by Thakin Nu, it has contacted the British side, expressing the hope that the conclusions reached by the Burmese delegation led by Thakin Nu in recent discussions with Prime Minister Attlee in London will be announced as soon as possible. People here generally expect that the Thakin Nu government will continue the government of Aung San, accelerate the work of the constitutional assembly, and based on the opinions already expressed by the British, they also deeply agree with this policy.

British Troops Prepare to Maintain Order

[Reuters, Rangoon, 22nd] A British Army spokesman for the Burma Command said that if reckless elements intend to take advantage of the situation created by this massacre, Britain is prepared to provide Burma with any assistance it needs. British troops have already taken measures to assist the Burmese army. If the Burmese government requests the assistance of the British Command in Burma to maintain law and order, British troops will provide it. The spokesman did not disclose the strength of British troops stationed in Burma. The British Command ordered British soldiers not to enter Rangoon today to prevent incidents during the Burmese Communist Party and trade union mourning demonstrations.

Burmese Government Offers Reward for Arrest of Murderers

[United Press, Rangoon, 22nd] The Burmese government has offered a reward of 10,000 rupees for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators of the nineteen-cabinet assassination case.

The government also announced that it will establish a special court to investigate evidence and try those arrested in connection with the case.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 22nd] The bodies of the seven murdered cabinet members were displayed in the Grand Hall according to national ceremony, and representatives from student government officials and various organizations flocked to pay their respects.

### Coal Mine Nationalization Case Still at an Impasse; Japanese Cabinet Crisis Intensifies; Conflicting Opinions Among the Three Parties; Consultation Ends Without Result

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The consultation meeting among the three parties of the Japanese cabinet to discuss the coal mine nationalization case was held at 1:00 p.m. on the 23rd, making a comparative study of the government's draft nationalization bill and the three parties' production increase countermeasures. However, regarding the nationalization case, whether it would help increase coal production, the opinions of the government and the Socialist Party were sharply opposed to those of the Democratic Party, so the meeting ended without result. The fate of this issue is expected to be known by the middle of this month.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Regarding the coal mine nationalization issue, the Japanese Liberal Party plans to convene a coal committee on the 25th after the members currently conducting on-site investigations in Hokkaido and Kyushu return to Tokyo, to determine the party's final attitude. Uehara, the chairman of the coal mine countermeasures committee, who returned to Tokyo after inspecting various coal mines in Kyushu, said on the 22nd: "Regarding the nationalization of coal mines, the capitalists are absolutely opposed. As for the opinions of the workers, I have heard them in various places, but there is no firm belief in supporting nationalization. In short, if the funding problem can be resolved, I am confident that the desired production target can be achieved without implementing nationalization."

### US and Soviet Representatives on Control Committee for Japan Debate Japanese Land Reform Policy

[United Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Soviet representative Lieutenant General Derevyanko attacked the Japanese land reform plan on the 23rd, saying that at best it was only an incomplete measure, and even the attempt to distribute land to farmers was hindered. At the meeting of the Control Committee for Japan on the morning of the 23rd, Derevyanko had a heated debate with Chairman Acheson. Derevyanko said: "According to the figures presented, the entire result, from a democratic standpoint, is unsatisfactory." He attacked the Japanese farmers for giving up their right to vote in this major effort due to [reasons not specified]. Acheson resolutely defended this policy. The Soviet representative quoted figures from the "Oriental Economist" newspaper, intending to show that Japan's original policy intended to transfer 1,225,000 acres of land to farmers, but to date not a single acre of land has been sold to farmers. Therefore, I cannot admit that the reform has been successfully implemented.

Acheson ordered Hughes, an agricultural specialist from the Allied Headquarters, to refute the attack that this plan had failed. Hughes pointed out that the Japanese government had purchased 336,000 acres of land on July 2 for resale to tenant farmers. 316,000 acres were acquired before March 31. In addition, 659,000 acres were requisitioned by the government in lieu of taxes and are available for distribution to tenant farmers.

### Liberal Party Members Detained in Japanese Hidden Goods Incident

All those who have been arrested or are under investigation are related to the five million yen worth of materials hidden and associated with a certain political party.

### Arab Representatives State Their Views; Oppose the Establishment of a Jewish State; and Demand Full Implementation of Self-Determination

[Reuters, Beirut, 22nd] Lebanese Foreign Minister Frank, speaking on behalf of six countries, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen, presented his views to the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, demanding that the immigration of Jews into Palestine be stopped immediately. He also believed that Zionist factions were plotting to launch violence in Transjordan, Syria, and Lebanon. He submitted a memorandum to the UN Investigation Committee, stating the threat to the autonomy of the Arab race and the peace of the Middle East, and the Arab governments demanded the immediate and full implementation of self-determination. Now, Zionist factions have established secret army organizations to engage in destructive actions. These activities are bound to cause the Arab side to engage in similar organizations to repel Jewish aggression, which will cause turmoil in the Middle East and harm the position of the Jewish race in the entire Arab world. Frank also stated that if the Jewish race achieves the goal of establishing a state, the Arab countries will implement political and economic boycotts, and the partition plan of Palestine is sufficient to complicate the situation. The Arabs put forward a compromise suggestion, that every Jew who has legally obtained Palestinian citizenship should have equal rights and obligations, and that an independent government should be established in proportion to representation.

### Important Soviet Representatives in the United States All Have Secret Missions; Kravchenko Testifies Before US House Committee

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Former Soviet Purchasing Commission official in the United States, Kravchenko, told the US House Committee on Un-American Activities: "Every responsible Soviet representative in the United States can be regarded as an economic or political spy." Kravchenko appeared today as a key witness at the committee's hearing. The hearing aims to find evidence to arrest the fifth column operating in the United States.

Kravchenko defected from the Communist Party last year and announced the activities of the Communist Party in a widely distributed book titled "I Chose Freedom". He described how Soviet agents gathered secret information about American aviation and submarine aspects, as well as other documents. He accused the Communist Party of promoting policies in the United States to create chaos, disputes, and strikes in order to weaken American power until the United States could not oppose Soviet foreign policy. Kravchenko said: "Only the United States can stop Soviet aggression." He predicted that if Stalin died recently, Molotov might succeed Stalin, but his policies would be the same. He also accused the Soviet Union of seeming to prefer its vassal states to suffer from hunger rather than participate in American relief programs. He warned that the Communist accomplices in the United States were even more dangerous than the true Communists, and claimed that "Chicago Sun" publisher Field was more dangerous than 30% of the well-known members of the Communist Party, and that the trouble he personally caused to the United States would be more than that caused by the people of the Communist Party. Kravchenko admitted that he actively studied the problem of uranium refining in the Soviet Union in 1942. He also warned that the Soviet Union is doing its best to manufacture atomic bombs. He estimated that there are 3.5 million members of the Soviet Communist Party, with another 2.5 million probationary members and 10 million young Communist Party members.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 23rd] The head of the Indian Princes Conference, the Prince of Patiala State, claimed that the Dominion of India is expected to reach a federal alliance agreement with 60% of the princely states in India today, and the Princes Conference will effectively come to an end. Liaison between the states will be replaced by a new organization. Most of the princely states will become an integral part of the Dominion of India, and the powers that must be exercised centrally, such as national defense, diplomacy, and transportation, will be exercised by the Indian federal authorities. The details of this merger are still under study and are expected to undergo significant revisions before being approved by the princes.

### Chinese Painting Exhibition Held in Geneva; Visitors Are Extremely Enthusiastic

In addition, ancient Chinese paintings are also displayed, including a painting called "Surprise on the Rock," which is a genuine work by Emperor Song Zong.

### American Journalist Group Arrives in Seoul

[United Press, Seoul, 23rd] The group of American journalists inspecting the Far East arrived here on the evening of the 22nd and were hosted by Lieutenant General Hodge at a banquet that night.

### British Fleet Visits Turkey, No Less Than Reaffirming the Anglo-Turkish Alliance

[Agence France-Presse, Turkish Capital, 22nd] Regarding the visit of the British Navy fleet to Turkish territorial waters today, well-informed sources here commented: This visit is no less than a reaffirmation of the Anglo-Turkish alliance. The Anglo-Turkish treaty was signed in 1939 and is the only alliance treaty between Turkey and a foreign country that exists today and has not lost its effect or value. The British fleet's visit to Turkey is purely an ordinary visit and does not have any political effect. Turkey's invitation to the British fleet to visit Turkey can be interpreted as meaning that although the country currently relies on the United States in practice, it is still equally loyal to the Anglo-Turkish alliance treaty. The British Navy fleet visiting the Bosphorus Strait is commanded by Admiral Willis, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet.

### Three American Warships Arrive on the French Riviera

There were a large number of warships participating in the review, from battleships and aircraft carriers to submarines and landing craft, totaling 109 ships, which was the only time it had been seen since the coronation ceremony of the British King in 1937. As the British royal family conducted the review, the British Navy fired a 21-gun salute in tribute.

### US Congress Plans to Form Mixed Committee to Go to Europe to Investigate the Economy; US Aid to Europe May Exceed 2.3 Billion Dollars

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The House of Representatives passed a provisional motion today advocating that a mixed committee of 19 members from the House and Senate be organized to go to Europe to investigate the economic situation of various countries during the Congressional recess. The American military occupation zone in Germany and Austria are also included, and estimate the needs of European countries in order to implement Secretary of State Marshall's aid to Europe plan. Among them, some of the representatives are members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, bankers, financiers, and senior military officials from the Army and Navy.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] According to Washington news: American aid to Europe in accordance with the Marshall Plan may exceed 2.3 billion US dollars, for a period of one year, and if the plan proceeds smoothly, funds will continue to be allocated. However, President Truman recently told Congress that even with the European aid plan, American exports are expected to begin to decrease next year.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] Those in charge here say that one of the major controversial issues raised during the Paris Economic Conference was the issue of offsetting accounts. It is extremely difficult for the sixteen countries participating in the conference to balance their budgets in the short term. Under these circumstances, it is generally believed that the finances of the British and American merged zone in Germany do not need to be stabilized immediately. When European countries, especially Britain, are unable to balance their budgets, it is not only unfair but also dangerous to give huge financial benefits to other countries.

### US Congress Will Form Near East Inspection Team

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The US House of Representatives approved the establishment of a congressional group today to go to the Near East for inspection before September of this year. Representative Bolton, a member of the small team, said that the team will investigate Palestine and the Arab movement, and will inspect Cairo, Palestine, Transjordan, Syria, and Lebanon.

### Our Country's Representative to the Security Council Temporarily Replaced by Chiang Ting-fu; Kuo Tai-chi's Health Has Not Recovered

His health has not recovered yet, and the government has approved his continued leave, and at the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 22nd, it was passed that Chiang Ting-fu will temporarily serve in his position. The threat of German invasion, this statement was recently denied by well-informed sources here, and said that we have not heard of it.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] The statement from Washington that the United States and France will sign a military alliance has not yet been confirmed by Paris. A spokesman for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that he had not heard of it and had not received the State Department's [word unreadable]. Also, he said that he knew nothing about the statement made in the newspaper calling for a meeting of the three countries, Britain, America and France.

### American Commissioner to Austria Accuses Soviet Army of Kidnapping Citizens

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] In a report submitted to the War Department, the US High Commissioner to Austria, Keyes, accused individuals in Soviet army uniforms of kidnapping citizens on the streets of Vienna. In June, ten people disappeared in Vienna in this way, mostly nationals of Soviet-controlled countries. Although the official US military report did not mention it, various newspapers have reported it in detail and it has been confirmed by sources who could be relied upon. The High Commissioner's report also stated: The Allied Control Council originally allowed those with passes to cross the borders of the occupation zones. However, the Soviet side broke this agreement without explanation, preventing those with passes from entering or leaving the Soviet zone. Keyes believes that the purpose of the Soviet move is to prevent political refugees from fleeing into the British and American occupation zones.

### Security Council Continues to Discuss Balkan Situation Passes Preface to US Proposal

### Britain and France Agree on Opposing Raising German Industrial Standards Bidault Says France's Policy Toward Germany Remains Unchanged

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Well-informed sources here said today: The United States may maintain its intention to promote a military alliance to prevent possible future German aggression, but it is definitely not like the proposal recently circulated in Washington to form an equal treaty between France and the United States. When the London Foreign Ministers' Conference is held in November this year, the United States may raise the issue of a four-nation security treaty again. At this time, if the proposal of an equal treaty or a three-nation treaty is put forward, it will greatly affect the success of the four-nation treaty. Furthermore, France does not want to increase Germany's industrial production significantly at the expense of granting priority to countries invaded by Germany to restore their steel industries. In other words, Germany can only retain the lowest level of steel mills and foundries. Currently, in the battle over German industrial standards, Britain and France seem to be united in dealing with the United States. British Foreign Secretary Bevin once said: Significantly raising German industrial standards will endanger security. On the other hand, representatives of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee believe that such fears are not appropriate, and Germany's industry is necessary for European reconstruction.

In order to resolve the Korean crisis, we are convening an international conference.

### Be Vigilant Against Japan's Economic Offensive Shao Yulin Discusses the Peace Treaty with Japan

[Exclusive Interview by New Asia News Agency] In recent days, issues such as the peace treaty with Japan and trade with Japan have become imminent. Our reporter specially visited Mr. Shao Yulin, a well-known authority on Far Eastern issues and executive director of the East Asia Association, who recently came to Shanghai from Nanjing. He was asked about his opinions on the principles and attitude towards the peace treaty with Japan, the timing and location of the treaty, the issue of compensation, the issue of trade with Japan, the issue of Japanese debts, and the recent preliminary consultation meeting on the peace treaty with Japan convened by the United States. Mr. Shao spoke freely and said: After I arrived in Shanghai this time, I exchanged opinions with many experts on Japanese issues, such as Wang Yunsheng, Xu Yiqiao, Liu Baimin, Cui Geqiu, Meng Xianzhang, Song Yuelun, Li Qiusheng, Fang Qiuhou, Zhao Nanrou, Liu Juenong, and Zhou Changshou. Now, I will summarize the opinions of various experts and my personal opinions and answer them one by one: We believe that the fundamental principle of the peace treaty with Japan is that, in addition to being based on the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, Japan's armed forces must be thoroughly disarmed so that Japan will never be able to invade again. Politically, it must be democratic, and economically, it must be prevented from harming China and the world. Among the military, political, and economic issues, the economic issue is the most important, because economic power is combat power. Although Japan is under the control of the Allied forces and cannot launch a military offensive, the threat of its "economic offensive" is already facing us.

Regarding the issue of compensation, some people only pay attention to how to destroy Japan's heavy industry, but fail to take into account the possible economic offensive of Japan's light industry. From our country's standpoint, backward heavy industrial equipment is of no benefit to the current and future economic construction. In order to remedy the fact that demolishing old heavy industrial equipment has no practical benefit to us, we should propose a request for cash compensation and production compensation. Some factories for production compensation should also be designated as compensation items and kept for future relocation, otherwise it will only increase Japan's productivity. As for the issue of trade with Japan, I sympathize with the proposal to stop opening trade with Japan and stop sending commercial representatives, but I don't think it is necessary. The latter is only for exchanging and collecting trade information, and its trade behavior must be approved by our government and MacArthur Headquarters. The United States has opened up Japan's foreign trade in order to reduce the burden and maintain Japan's minimum living standards, so its opening up is inevitable. For the sake of our national industry and foreign markets, we should also actively try to guide and restrict it, such as the Sino-Japanese trade method, tariff system, and even export agreements or understandings. The government should also have the right to make overall adjustments to the interests of exporters and importers, national industries, and consumers. When talking about the issue of Japanese territory, Mr. Shao advocated that "Japan is the Japan of the Japanese," meaning that only the territories originally owned by the Japanese nation and not obtained by aggression are Japanese territories. The issue of the Ryukyu Islands can be handled by China and the United States concluding a trusteeship agreement in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Finally, Mr. Shao also talked about the procedures and rules of procedure for the preliminary consultation meeting on the peace treaty with Japan convened by the United States this time, saying that he does not insist on opposing the preliminary consultation on the peace treaty with Japan being changed from the four foreign ministers to the Far Eastern Commission or the current eleven-nation conference. However, if our country's veto power is abandoned and a two-thirds majority voting method is used, under the current international situation and for the sake of our country's interests, it should be carefully considered. I believe the authorities will handle it well. Finally, he said that he agrees with the United States and the authorities to advance the timing of the peace treaty with Japan, but he and his friends unanimously oppose the proposal of some Allied personnel to make Tokyo the location of the peace treaty.

### Japan's Ambitions Are Becoming More and More Obvious Newspapers Repeatedly Issue Calls for "Living Space" Hokkaido Assembly Asks Soviet Union to Return Three Islands

[Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd] Not many days after the proposal to convene a preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace treaty was announced, Japanese newspapers have issued calls for living space. The Yomiuri Shimbun and the English-language Japan Times have successively published articles by Japanese entrepreneur Aoki, mentioning the "deprivation" of Japan's foreign land and the crowding of 75 million people on the Japanese mainland. After mentioning the "China Incident" and the "Manchurian Incident," the author pointed out that Japan's pre-war territory included Korea, southern Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands, and the South Pacific Islands, and at that time, Japan's population was still less than 65 million. He continued: Today, Japan has not only been "deprived" of foreign land, but its increased population has to be confined to the mainland, and its production capacity is less than half of what it was before. The author continued to ask: How much space will Japan's current production capacity have for exports? The solution he proposed is to work hard. Since this article has appeared in Japanese newspapers twice, it means that it has passed the news check of the Allied Headquarters twice. Most of the British expats are deeply concerned and uneasy about the aforementioned proposal to work hard to solve the problem, and believe that it is a smokescreen for the author to conceal the true purpose of the article.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The Hokkaido Assembly of Japan has decided to ask MacArthur to return to Japan the three islands off the eastern coast of Hokkaido that are currently occupied by the Soviet army. According to the assembly, these three islands are rich in marine products, and if they are returned to Japan, they will greatly benefit the relief of food shortages.

### How Shanghai Cooperates with the General Mobilization Order The Mayor Received Instructions in Nanjing Took Kirk's Private Plane Back After Visiting the Chairman Yesterday The Central Government Decided to Subsidize the City Budget Due to Insufficiency

[Our News] Mayor Wu was summoned by Chairman Chiang via telegram and took the night express train to Nanjing the night before last. After meeting with Chairman Chiang, he took Admiral Kirk's private plane back here at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. In addition to Admiral Kirk, the driver who came to Shanghai also included Zhang Peter, head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Municipal Government, and others. The private plane arrived at Jiangwan Airport at 3:50 p.m. yesterday.

After getting off the plane, the mayor went straight back to his official residence on Anfu Road to rest. According to him, the purpose of this trip was purely to report on the price situation in the city, because it had been more than a month since he last went to Nanjing, and the Chairman was very concerned about the living conditions in Shanghai. According to Wu, the Chairman has given some instructions on how Shanghai should cooperate after the promulgation of the General Mobilization Order. As for the rumor that Mayor Wu's trip to Nanjing this time was related to Special Envoy Weidemaier, Wu has denied it yesterday. He also dismissed the saying that Wu will serve as the ambassador to the United States as unfounded. It is said that there will absolutely not be any changes in personnel.

### Tian Yongqian and Min Xiangfan Return to Shanghai After Finishing Official Business

Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Min Xiangfan, Director of the Accounting Office of the Municipal Government, went to Nanjing together last week to ask the central government to approve the supplementary budget for the city government's deficit in the 36th year and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after finishing their official business. Reporters interviewed Director Tian and Director Min separately yesterday afternoon to inquire about this trip. As a result, it is said that this trip to Nanjing was in response to a telegram from the Ministry of Finance. The main thing was to discuss the budget issue of the city in the 36th year. After going to Nanjing, they first visited the Accounting Office of the Executive Yuan and frequently contacted and negotiated with the Local Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance. The original intention of the Ministry of Finance was to balance the city's revenue and expenditure budget, and planned to increase the revenue part appropriately. After repeated negotiations, they were fortunate to understand the local plight. As for the results of this trip to Nanjing, the more important ones are about four points: (1) The central government has decided in principle to provide subsidies to the city. This is an appropriation, and it can continue to be requested when civil servants' salaries are adjusted in the future. (2) The 30% of the business tax that should be allocated to the central government may be completely allocated to the city. According to reporters, according to the budget figures, about 24 billion yuan can be added each year.

Special Business Tax to be Implemented from July

(3) The starting date for the special business tax can also be accepted in principle as the original star of the Finance Bureau, please change it to be implemented from July 1. Director Tian repeatedly emphasized this point, not to fight for income, but entirely to facilitate merchants and improve the tax system. (4) The housing donation regulations stipulate that self-used houses that do not exceed one room per person are exempt from donation. This article can also be transferred for amendment. In short, the central government's perception of the city is that the city is an area where wealth is concentrated, and it is more difficult to request subsidies than in other places. However, after many efforts this time, the results are not yet satisfactory.

### Industrial Workers' Military Service Issue The General Federation of Trade Unions Plans to Request Postponement The Issue of Dismissal Pay Also Becomes the Focus of Discussion Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors to be Held Today

[Our News] The Municipal General Federation of Trade Unions is scheduled to hold the eighth joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the fifth session at 4:00 p.m. today. It is reported that the central issues to be discussed at today's meeting will be three (1) The issue of military service for industrial workers. The General Federation of Trade Unions believes that under the General Mobilization Order, frontline troops are indeed important, but rear production cannot be ignored either, and it is planned to request a postponement of conscription. (2) Workers' income tax, which was previously approved by the authorities to be exempt from taxation, has recently been heard that the Direct Taxation Bureau is planning to levy it again, and the labor community unanimously demands continued exemption. (3) Dismissal issue. The Municipal Labor-Management Evaluation Committee has agreed that workers who have served for more than three years should be paid dismissal pay by the employer, up to three months and at least half a month. It is now heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association have asked the Ministry of Social Affairs for instructions, and it has been said that they have received a reply from the Ministry of Social Affairs, confirming that the dismissal issue should be handled in accordance with the Factory Law. According to the Factory Law, workers can be dismissed, but they must be notified one month in advance, and there is no provision for dismissal pay. Therefore, workers believe that this issue is very serious. If the Factory Law is followed, workers' jobs will not be guaranteed at all, and neither the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau nor the General Federation of Trade Unions has received this decree, so it will be discussed in detail at today's meeting.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhe Ship Hits Stone Near Xiamen No Danger of Sinking But Need to Barge Out Glass Sand

[Our News] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Zhe Ship sailed from Shanghai to Guangdong on the 5th of this month, carrying goods, and also to Xiamen, Taiwan.

The place is located east of Xiamen, between Jinmen Island and Huating Island, west of Axe Bay, and no ships have ever sailed there. The captain of the Hai Zhe Ship hired a pilot because he was unfamiliar with the route there. After being fully loaded with glass sand on the 22nd, it set sail back to Shanghai. At noon, it unexpectedly touched a stone on the bottom of the sea due to shallow water and heavy ship, causing damage to all five cabins before and after. Seawater entered the ship.

### Wu Guozhang's Case Concluded, Judgment Scheduled for the 30th

[Our News] Wu Guozhang, husband of former actress Zhou Manhua, was accused of aiding the enemy with cotton. The case was concluded in the High Court yesterday, and the judgment is scheduled for the 30th of this month. Wu wore a light gray vanadium suit yesterday. According to his confession: Pudong Yuansheng Cotton Mill was opened by his brother Wu Guoxin. Maocheng Cotton Firm was established in the 31st year with a capital of 20 million Central Reserve Certificates. He only invested 2 million yuan and was elected as the manager. The cotton was sold to the same industry and was responsible by brokers. In the 34th year, 500 loads of cotton were sold to Yoshida Yoko, handled by a Mr. Ye. The goods were delivered in two batches, with a price of 200,000 Central Reserve Certificates per load, totaling 100 million Central Reserve Certificates. The court asked, "Do you know that cotton is a military supply! The raw material for making explosives?" Wu replied that merchants do not understand. The court asked, "After the victory, you had a large amount of enemy property cotton. Have you handed it over to the Enemy and Puppet Property Processing Bureau completely?" He replied, "It has been handed over." Then the defense lawyer claimed: In the indictment, the name of Colonel Sasaki of Yoshida Yoko appears, which seems to be a soldier. In fact, "Colonel" is a mistake for "Daizo", who is a Japanese businessman. Therefore, the difference in one word is quite large, so he applied for correction. Also, cotton is a military supply, and only those with specialized knowledge can know it. The defendant is a merchant and cannot understand it. At the end of the court debate, the date of the judgment was scheduled. After meeting with his family, he was sent back to prison.

Wu admitted that he had served in a puppet position, saying that it was because of his popularity that he was spotted by the enemy army and forced to serve as the puppet district chief. As for the crimes accused in the indictment, they are all untrue. He claimed that unemployed vagrants borrowed money unsuccessfully and filed false accusations out of spite. After the trial, he was still sent back to prison.

### Application for Exemption from Military Service for Conscripts Expected to be Completed on the 29th

[Our News] The city is handling the application for exemption from military service for conscripts, which is currently being rushed by the military section of the Civil Affairs Office, supervising the Baojia in each district. This work can be completed on the 29th of this month. Yesterday, according to Section Chief Yao of the section: The 3,000 military conscripts in the city will be filled by volunteers as much as possible.

However, before the lottery, matters such as the preparation of barracks equipment, the raising of resettlement fees, and the care of new recruits must be properly planned, and the conscription procedures (including the application and review of exemption from military service) must be completed.

### Bicycles Not Exchanging for New Licenses: Punished According to Law If Caught

Therefore, it has ordered its subordinates to strictly inspect this year's new vehicle permits starting today. If there are any cases of deception, they will be punished according to the law.

### Ten Thousand Yuan Military Aid Movement: City Divided into Thirty Districts; Comprehensive Promotion Scheduled; Fundraising Based on Voluntary Participation; Exchange Military Aid Coupons on the Spot After Donation

Since the various sectors of this city launched the Ten Thousand Yuan Military Aid Movement to suppress the communists and build the nation, the enthusiasm has been very high. Various parties have been paying money to the municipal government and municipal party headquarters for military aid and inquiring about donation procedures. According to the person in charge of the conference: The fundraising work in this city was originally scheduled to start on the 21st, but it was changed to the 27th of this month due to the careful procedures for printing military aid coupons and stamping war records. The methods are roughly as follows:

(1) The fundraising targets are based on regions. The city is divided into 30 districts for implementation. Each district will form a fundraising subcommittee, with the chairman of the district representative assembly serving as the chairman, the district chief serving as the vice-chairman, and representatives of senators, party members, farmers, workers, and women serving as fundraising committee members. (2) The fundraising time for each urban area district is from July 27 to August 2. The fundraising time for each suburban district is from July 27 to August 5, and all donations must be submitted to the City Bank for settlement by August 6. (3) The fundraising principle is that each household is expected to donate at least 10,000 yuan, but it is based on voluntary participation and does not adopt apportionment methods. Poor households can also be exempted from fundraising. (4) Fundraising procedures: The conference printed five types of military aid coupons, divided into 10,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan, and 1 million yuan, totaling 12.8 billion yuan. All those who donate money for military aid must exchange for military aid coupons as receipts. Please exchange the donation for military aid coupons on the spot for each household's donation. It is best to paste the coupons on the door to show that every household supports the donation of military aid to suppress the communists and build the nation. (5) Procedures for receiving coupons and paying money: All military aid coupons will be issued by the City Bank representative. Each district fundraising committee will receive them from the City Bank with the chairman and vice-chairman's stamps based on the planned amount. At the end, the donations and remaining coupons will be directly submitted to the City Bank for settlement. In addition, the money donated daily by each district will be temporarily deposited in nearby banks or City Bank offices, and then transferred to the City Bank for transfer at the end. (6) Fundraising methods for groups and individuals: In addition to household fundraising, any groups and individuals who respond to the Ten Thousand Yuan Military Aid and voluntarily donate money should purchase military aid coupons from the City Bank and its offices with the donations. Donations previously handed over to the municipal government and municipal party headquarters for transfer must also be handed over to the City Bank to exchange for military aid coupons and returned to the original donors as receipts to show caution.

[Additional News] Mayor Wu attaches great importance to the Ten Thousand Yuan Military Aid Movement. He has scheduled to convene all district chiefs, deputy district chiefs, chairmen of district people's representatives, and fundraising personnel at the Municipal Senate on the 25th to discuss promotion methods and invite media personnel to study together.

### President Zhang's New Wife Secretly Arrives in Shanghai: Flutters Down from the Plane, Shyly Avoiding the Camera; A Puff of Smoke and Drives Away; Mrs. Xu Zhimo Accompanies on the Same Flight

[Our Own Report] Ms. Zhou Bixia, the new wife of President Zhang of the National Bank, arrived at Longhua Airport at 5:35 PM yesterday on the "Air King." As Zhang Jia'ao went to Beijing on official business, his daughter Zhang Junmai, as a niece, represented to welcome the new aunt. Many senior officials of the National Bank also went to welcome and take care of everything. Mrs. Zhang's arrival yesterday was done secretly, and the relatives and friends who went to the airport to welcome her were silent about it. After the "Air King" landed, passengers walked away one after another, but Mrs. Zhang remained seated. An official from the customs office stepped into the cabin to express his congratulations, but Mrs. Zhang smiled without saying a word. He repeatedly asked his accompanying friend, "Are there any photographers outside?" At this time, the welcoming relatives and friends waited anxiously outside the waiting room, not knowing that the bride had her own clever plan. At this time, the flight attendant on the plane told the reporter of this newspaper standing by the plane that all the passengers had disembarked, but as soon as the reporter turned and walked back to the waiting room, Mrs. Zhang quickly walked down the stairs from the plane and left with another elderly female passenger. This noble lady, who has become a news item, was wearing a white-bottomed green floral cheongsam, sunglasses, and a camera. She was of medium height, plump and healthy, and had a graceful and dignified demeanor. When the reporter approached to take a photo, she immediately covered her face with a folding fan. After shaking hands with the welcomers in a hurry, without exchanging greetings, she was accompanied by the welcomers out of the waiting room and quickly boarded a prepared car. When the reporter of this newspaper asked to take another photo, Secretary Lu Dingzhong of the National Bank strongly prevented it, saying that this was "Mrs. Zhu Yigeng", not the president's wife. Then the car drove away quickly. At this time, the relatives and friends of the Zhang family and the staff of the National Bank were busy with the baggage inspection procedures for her at the customs checkpoint, and it took about half an hour to complete. The luggage brought by this noble lady was marked with cloth strips with the words "Zhou Bixia, 60 Cave, Daxi Road". Summarizing all the things heard and seen, this so-called "Mrs. Zhu" is undoubtedly the new wife of Zhang Jia'ao. At about 7:00 PM, Secretary Lu of the National Bank called again, emphasizing that this female passenger was indeed "Mrs. Zhu Yigeng", fearing that this newspaper would mistakenly think she was Mrs. Zhang and send the wrong news, and came to inform us. His concern is very appreciated. But being too enthusiastic makes people feel like "trying to cover up". At 8:30 PM, this newspaper received a special telegram from this newspaper's Peiping correspondent, which read in part: "Ms. Zhou Bixia flew to Shanghai on the Air King at 1:00 PM, wearing a white-bottomed green floral cheongsam, round face, round eyes, plump body, and black glasses, and carrying a red and white coat and a camera. Mrs. Xu (i.e., Zhang's second sister, Mrs. Xu Zhimo) was wearing a gray overcoat, taller, about fifty years old, also wearing black glasses and traveled with her", which is exactly the same as what the reporter of this newspaper saw at Longhua Airport. Therefore, the new wife of the president of the National Bank has indeed arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The so-called "Mrs. Zhu" is just a smokescreen, probably because she was deeply afraid that the new wife would be surrounded and embarrassed by reporters when she got off the plane, and had no choice but to do so.

### Cathay Invites the Press, Film and Drama Celebrities to Express Opinions

[Our Own Report] Cathay Film Company invited the press yesterday to report on the progress of the "Fake Phoenix and False Dragon" dispute. During the meeting, Luo Xuelian, Cao Yu, and Ouyang Yuqian expressed several opinions.

Luo Xuelian said: "This matter is like a sesame seed cake. One says it is sweet, and the other says it is bitter. The problem is very simple. You can know by opening it and tasting it."

"I don't think the Cathay authorities have any intention of insulting. But on the other hand, if all the members of the barbershop industry think about it, they can't be said to be unreasonable for responding to the opposition before understanding the truth. However, this small misunderstanding can be easily resolved if you open the sesame seed cake and taste it, I believe."

"In the structure of the story, there must be characters, occupations, regions, and interweaving. Especially in comedy, laughter, mischief, and humor are necessary conditions, so it cannot be misinterpreted. There is no intention of insult here."

Cao Yu said: "I think the one who should protest the most is that bastard manager. In fact, the kindest is that third-class barber. In the end, he is not only the kindest, but also the bravest."

"Looking at the intention: the whole film is full of lightness. The ending is especially lovely. Without shouting slogans, it uses a method of awakening and kicks the bad guy away."

Ouyang Yuqian said: "Rather than saying it satirizes barbers, it is better to say that it satirizes a certain unreasonable enterprise company's general manager. This story is expressed with joy and is handled very satisfactorily."

"If the barber relied on a woman to take a car and live in a foreign house at the end, this would be a real insult. Now that the third-class finally gives up hypocrisy and ends this story in the situation of self-reliance, it seems that there should be no more misunderstanding."

### Daylight Kidnapping Case in Jiangwan: Principal Offender Wu Jie Caught: Watching a Play in the Theater, Extreme Joy Turns to Sorrow

[Our Own Report] Wu Jie, the principal offender in the daylight kidnapping case that occurred in Jiangwan on the 19th of this month, was at large. It is now known that the offender has been arrested by the Yangshupu Military Police Branch. On the 19th, at noon, Zhang Jingen, a villager from Xizhangjia Village, Jiangwan Town, was kidnapped by three plainclothes men and two uniformed men in a dispatched car. The Jiangwan Police Branch solved the case within four hours, rescued the hostage in a secret room at No. 14, Lane 484, Tongbei Road, and arrested Qi Jiagen and Qi Xiuying, who were guarding the hostage. A note was posted outside the secret room door, which read "This is an important prisoner, no one is allowed to meet, this order, Wu Jie." This principal offender Wu Jie served as the captain of the military police team and the company commander of the puppet army during the enemy and puppet era. Recently, he pretended to be the captain of the Third Brigade of the Fourth Section of the Police Department of the Military Police Headquarters and colluded with local ruffians Wan Yougen, Pu Guisheng, and unruly soldiers Chen Shangguan, Xie Shibing, etc. in the Yangshupu area, extorting money everywhere. He also used the name of soldiers to protect the construction of sheds in the Tongbei Road and Huoshan Road area and extorted 500,000 yuan in legal tender from shed owner Zhou Jintai, committing numerous crimes. After the kidnapping case was solved, the offender was still at large, enjoying himself freely. The next day (the 20th) at 9:00 PM, he went to see a play at the Fulong Theater in Yaojiaqiao, Yangshupu. This was learned by Zhou Hancheng, the captain of the Yangshupu Military Police Team, who ordered his staff Liu Zhongshu to lead four military police officers and Qi Hongxue (the father of Qi Jiagen, who guarded the hostage) to the theater. At that time, Wu Jie was concentrating and elated. Qi Hongxue identified him in the dark, and the military police rushed up and arrested the offender, turning extreme joy into sorrow. After interrogation, he confessed to kidnapping Zhang Jingen and the various crimes he had committed.

### Labor Dispute Erupts Again at International Hotel: Waiters Refuse Transfer: Lin Yili Pulls Out a Handgun

[Our Own Report] A labor dispute has broken out again between labor and management at the International Hotel. According to waiters in the room department: During the previous dispute between the two parties, it was agreed that the base salary for employees in the room department would be calculated at 85% and the base salary for employees on the 14th floor would be calculated at 65%. Recently, the employees voluntarily changed the base salary for the room department to 80% and the base salary for the 14th floor to 60%. On the 19th of this month, the personnel department suddenly posted a notice transferring Wang Guixing, the general representative of the room department employees, to the writing room. All the employees in the room department expressed dissatisfaction with this and requested Manager Lin Mianzhi to withdraw the order on the 22nd.

The employees insisted on withdrawing the order, and during the conversation, Manager Lin took out a handgun and placed it on the table.

### An Old Thief Humiliated by Petty Thieves; Attempting to Gain Without Labor, All Arrested Together

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lu Jiawan Police Sub-bureau Patrol Officer Tai Bolang, Police Chief Hao Chen, Police Officer He Yushan, and others, at approximately 4:30 AM the previous morning, discovered three young men behaving suspiciously near the Yuxing Sheng Rice Noodle shop at No. 2 Nanchang Road. They then observed a man, over fifty years old, climbing down from the wall. The three young men immediately surrounded him. The officers, believing none of them to be good people, rushed forward and only managed to apprehend one of the young men and the old man who had climbed down from the wall.

After taking them to the station for interrogation, the old man confessed: His name is Liao Baorong, from Ningbo, 48 years old, and he makes a living by stealing. He had just climbed over the wall at that location and stolen a burlap sack containing four dou of white rice. Just as he was climbing out, he was suddenly confronted by these three individuals who claimed to be civil servants and seized him. At the time, he did not recognize whether they were genuine or not, so he had no choice but to admit to the theft. They then asked if there were any bicycles inside. He replied that there were. They then ordered him to climb back over the wall and open the iron gate, but because the gate was exceptionally sturdy, he was unable to do so. When he climbed out for the second time, he was unfortunately spotted and arrested by the police. Upon questioning the arrested young man, he claimed his name was Li Miaosheng, 20 years old, from Nantong, residing at No. 35, Lane 4, Cao Xie Wan, Lujiabang, Nanshi. He is a bicycle thief and, along with the fleeing individuals nicknamed "Little Crab" and Yao Yuanxing, they specialize in stealing bicycles for a living. He also confessed that on the 13th, they stole a bicycle belonging to Ding Fuchang, a worker at the Zhengyan Newspaper in front of the newspaper office on Fuzhou Road, and sold it to Zhang Wanlin at No. 12, Haichao Road, Nanshi for 140,000 yuan, which they spent together. This case has been fully investigated and is scheduled to be submitted to the judicial authorities this morning for prosecution.

### Over 5,000 Elementary School Teachers in Shanghai Apply for Certification and Registration

Recently Exceeded 5,000 People

[Report from Our Newspaper] Over 5,000 people have applied for the certification and registration of elementary school teachers conducted by the Municipal Bureau of Education, and many of them have come from other counties. According to the Bureau of Education, this certification is only to protect qualifications and recognize them as qualified teachers, and it does not guarantee job placement. However, starting next semester, all teachers hired by municipal elementary schools must be certified. Private elementary schools will use the number of certified teachers as a standard for evaluation. For this certification, those with qualified documents will be issued a certificate after review. Those with unqualified documents will be asked to submit supplementary documents for review. The reasons for unqualified documents can be divided into two types: one is that documents were lost during the eight years of war and turmoil, which is understandable, and if they can provide sufficient proof of graduation from a certain school or previous service, it will be approved. However, forgery of documents with the intention of deception will not be approved.

### National Textbook Content Outdated; Even the Word "Atom" Not Included in the Atomic Age; Latest Revised National Edition Published by the Seven-Agency Alliance

[Report from the Dihua News Agency] Recently, the issue of new editions of national textbooks has arisen in the publishing industry, causing confusion and bewilderment. To clarify the situation, a reporter interviewed someone who has been involved in the production and printing of national textbooks since the wartime period in the rear and who continues to do so today. The national textbook's initial edition was published at the beginning of the Pacific War, named the "Provisional Edition." It was then revised and compiled into the "Standard Edition" after repeated discussions with various experts. At the beginning of the restoration, it was revised and compiled into the "Revised Edition" after collecting opinions from all parties. Before each printing, personnel from the National Institute for Compilation and Translation were sent to proofread. In the rush, it was inevitable that there would be some minor errors, which is not the responsibility of the publishing industry. However, the publishing houses of the Seven-Agency Alliance have already corrected these errors in books published after the spring of this year, based on the errata sheets compiled by the Institute for Compilation and Translation from the initial Revised Edition of previous years. The versions of the ten-plus publishers of the former Seven-Agency Alliance, including Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, World, Datong, Kaiming, Wentong, Children's, Chinese Culture, and Independent Victory, have been corrected one by one based on several errata sheets. Some merchants recently used "publication announcements" of the newly revised edition to attract cash, but in fact, their versions had become old versions before they were even published. There have been no major revisions to the content of the most recent national textbooks. The so-called new and old revised editions are merely promotional language used in the eyes of merchants. In reality, they are only corrections of a few minor errors. If one insists on distinguishing between new and old, then the publishers of the latest revised edition are still the ten-plus publishers, including Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, and Zhonghua, because these ten-plus publishers have all followed the latest revisions stipulated by the Ministry of Education, with complete supplies of various subjects for primary and secondary schools.

[Another Report] According to an educator, in the atomic age, China is lagging behind in everything, and the national textbooks, which are supposed to nurture the next generation, have not even included the word "atom." The outdated content is almost equivalent to ancient textbooks such as the Three Character Classic. They should be completely abolished immediately and rewritten, and new materials from the new era should be collected as much as possible to provide students with the latest knowledge. This is a fundamental condition for the country to cultivate talent, and it cannot be dealt with perfunctorily or carelessly, or it will always lead to the path of "lagging behind."

### National Education Staff in Shanghai to Begin Summer Training in the Coming Days; Dozens of Teachers Hired to Give Academic Lectures; Director Gu Presides Over Budget of 50 Million

The secondary school and social education staff groups will be postponed. The National Education Staff Summer Training Session will be held at Aurora University on Chongqing South Road, starting on July 27th and lasting for two weeks. The budget is estimated at 50 million, and the Ministry of Education has agreed to subsidize a portion.

### Rumors of Jiaotong University's Dissolution Are Inaccurate; Zhao Zengyu Returns to Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday and Says So

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhao Zengyu and another person, representatives of the Jiaotong University Alumni Association, went to Beijing to provide the Ministry of Education with the association's opinions on their alma mater. They have now completed their mission and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. Mr. Zhao told reporters yesterday that the association's representatives provided two points to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education: First, they requested the prompt appointment of a highly respected person to succeed as the university's president and preside over the university's affairs. Second, the reorganization of Jiaotong University's affairs should prioritize proactive measures over passive measures. Minister Zhu has accepted these points. As for the University Affairs Reorganization Committee established by the Ministry of Education, it is of a transitional nature and will be abolished as soon as the new president is appointed.

Regarding the rumors that Jiaotong University will be dissolved, Mr. Zhao said: They are completely inaccurate because Jiaotong University has a history of fifty years and has produced numerous engineering talents, which is evident to everyone in society.

Charity Tennis Tournament: (Top) Ye Guanxiong and Carson Shake Hands After the Match (Photo by China News Agency) (Bottom) Huang Shaohong Pictured with Jin Ruxuan, Who Purchased Charity Balls (Photo by Our Newspaper)

### Grand Charity Tennis Tournament; Ye Guanxiong and Carson; Tennis Racquet Auctioned for 25 Million Yuan

To relieve the flood disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi, Minister Bai, Vice President Huang, Provincial Chairman Huang, and others initiated a charity tennis match organized by the Tennis Committee. The Tennis Committee specially invited Hong Kong champion Ye Guanxiong, who recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, to participate and compete in a singles exhibition match with Shanghai champion Carson. The meeting of the two heroes from the North and South was a rare and grand event, and the charitable cause made it even more so. Therefore, nearly 1,000 people braved the heat to attend yesterday, making the atmosphere extremely lively. During the match, four charity balls were auctioned off and purchased by Jin Ruxuan of Zhen Tai Sports Association for 15 million yuan. Afterwards, Ye Guanxiong's tennis racquet was auctioned off, and Che Bingrong of Xi Hua Construction Company purchased it for 10 million yuan. Their enthusiasm is commendable. Vice President Huang presented each of the performing players with a medal.

Huang Shaohong Spoke At 5:00 PM, Vice President Huang Shaohong delivered a speech, stating that the flood disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi was serious, and he and the sports community in Shanghai had initiated a charity tennis match. He thanked people from all walks of life for attending on behalf of the flood victims in Guangdong and Guangxi. The match then began immediately. The results of the three matches are as follows:

(1) Ye Guanxiong and Carson (Singles) 3-6, 6-3, 7-7.

(2) Xie Zhaoliang and Li Guoyao Win Against Chen Yiyu and Tian Guang (Doubles) 6-3.

(3) Ye Guanxiong and Wang Wenzheng Win Against Carson and Shi Guiya (Doubles) 6-2, 6-3.

Ye and Carson Compete; Referee Hu Xiansheng Carson served first and won. Then each of them served and won until they were tied at 3-3. Carson then won three consecutive games to win the first set 6-3. In the second set, Ye Guanxiong fought hard and took three consecutive games. Carson counterattacked and was tied at 3-3. Ye made another effort and also won a set 6-3. In the final set, the competition between the two sides became even more intense. Ye Guanxiong always took the lead, achieving a situation of 5-3. Carson won three consecutive games to lead 6-5. Ye Guanxiong again forced a tie and took the lead with 7-6, before Carson once again tied it at 7-7. At that time, dark clouds gathered, and it looked like it would rain heavily. The organizers announced that the match would end in a draw.

Doubles Match Soon After The Dark Clouds Gradually Dispersed, and the Doubles Match Continued First, Xie Zhaoliang and Li Guopan competed against Chen Yiyu and Tian Guang. Because it was already late, only one set was played. As a result, Xie and Li won 6-3. The final doubles match was between Ye Guanxiong and Wang Wenzheng against Carson and Shi Guiya. When the match started, it was already dark. Shi Guiya was older and his eyesight was poor, so Carson had to carry the team. Ye and Wang took the opportunity to go straight in, and as a result, they won 6-2, 6-3 against Carson and Shi Guiya.

Mr. Ye's Performance The Chinese People Have High Hopes The skill of Ye Guanxiong's tennis has attracted a lot of attention. His posture and hitting skills are very good, and his volleying is particularly unique. His draws are also mostly wonderful, but his serve is slightly weak. Carson did not seem to be at his normal level yesterday. His smashes touched the net and he made double faults. It was clear that Ye was not as skilled as Carson, but as a 22-year-old youth, his achievements are already not bad, and his future is unlimited.

### Industrial and Commercial Groups Actively Exploring the Issue of Opening Trade with Japan: While Strengthening Controls Can Limit the Dumping of Japanese Goods, the Problems of Smuggling and Hidden Goods Cannot Be Ignored

Since MacArthur's headquarters approved foreign trade with Japan, our national authorities are also considering technical issues and sending commercial representatives to Japan, which has drawn close attention from the people nationwide. Given the impact of Japanese goods on national industries, Shanghai's domestic goods factories and all workers believe that the entry of Japanese goods will inevitably affect national industries. The Shanghai United Association of Domestically Made Mechanical Goods Factories specially convened a meeting the day before yesterday (the 22nd). The attending current directors, including Ren Daohong, Hong Nian, Hu Xiyuan, Hu Boxing, Gu Keming, and Wang Jiazhen, elected Hu Boxing as the chairman. After detailed discussions, all directors unanimously and enthusiastically opposed the plan. In addition to issuing a declaration asking for sympathy and assistance from all sectors, they also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government to immediately stop considering the plan and suspend the dispatch of representatives to Japan. They stated that independent countries should have their own trade policies and should not abandon their initiative due to international relations. Since the peace treaty has not yet been signed, war losses still need to be compensated, and it is still too early for commercial exchanges. Furthermore, since the people are still recovering from the war and unable to bear economic exploitation, factories struggling to survive cannot withstand the destruction caused by the influx of foreign goods. If there is a shortage of raw materials, barter trade has already been implemented. Under the current circumstances, where proper relations between China and Japan have not been restored, there is no need to open private trade. Japanese goods exported to Southeast Asia will seize the overseas markets of Chinese goods, and if they further invade the domestic market, our national industries will be destroyed, and all reconstruction efforts will be in vain. Therefore, opening trade with Japan will cause great harm to the country and the people, without any benefits, and there is no value in considering it.

### National Industrial Association to Hold Meeting Today

To discuss opposing the dumping of Japanese goods in China, the China National Industrial Association has specifically scheduled a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 24th in Beijing. The association's directors and supervisors from Shanghai, including Wu Yun Chu, Hu Jian Xiang, Rong Hong Yuan, Tian He Qing, Tang Cheng Zong, and Tao Guilin, took the night train to Beijing last night. Directors and supervisors from industrial associations in various regions will also come to Nanjing to attend the meeting. In addition to all directors and supervisors, the chairmen of industrial associations from various provinces will also be invited to participate. Before his departure, Director Tian Heqing told reporters that some people who are not aware of the actual situation believe that the entry of Japanese goods into China will not lead to dumping, in accordance with the country's economic policies. However, they do not know that the import of cheap goods is like mercury seeping into the ground, entering every home. Smuggling and hidden goods are rampant. Last year, domestic factories suffered huge losses from the import of cheap American goods, to the point where it was almost impossible to calculate. Moreover, the current prices of Japanese goods are even lower than those of American goods. Furthermore, according to Hu Boxing, a standing director of the National Industrial Association, all domestic manufacturers firmly oppose the import of Japanese goods, and he hopes that those who hold a different view will change their initial intentions.

According to reporter's inquiry, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Industrial Association, the China Production Promotion Association, the Shanghai United Association of Domestically Made Mechanical Goods Factories, and various industrial guilds will jointly discuss the issue of opposing the sale of Japanese goods in China.

### Explanation of Import Control: Stakes and Concerns

According to responsible persons from the Import Control Committee, from a purely economic standpoint, China can open trade with Japan because China needs a large amount of Japanese industrial raw materials. China needs foreign exchange to order various materials from abroad, and ordering Japanese materials is no different from ordering American materials. However, the United States' opening of trade with Japan this time is of course of great benefit to the United States itself, but if China opens trade with Japan, it will be harmful rather than beneficial to China because China's industry is not as developed as Japan's. Under these circumstances, China must strengthen control measures and prohibit the import of any materials that are not beneficial to China's construction. Furthermore, based on a realistic prediction, the volume of trade after the opening of trade between China and Japan will definitely be small, because China has strict import controls and Japan has joint controls by the Allied forces. Japan will definitely not be able to dump large quantities of cheap goods in China. The concerns of the Industrial Association have also been considered by the Import Control Committee. The Import Control Committee will definitely not allow Japan to ship large quantities of materials to China and destroy China's industry.

### Deputy Director of the Central Trust Bureau Discusses: Concerns Are Unnecessary

Regarding the opening of Japanese foreign trade, opinions vary. Some advocate for a temporary delay, while others express that there is no need to worry. Each side has its own reasons. The reporter specifically visited Luo Yin, Deputy Director of the Central Trust Bureau, to ask for his opinion. According to Luo, various parties have expressed concerns about this issue, which is incomprehensible to him personally. Opening Japanese foreign trade may not necessarily benefit China's industry and commerce, but we must know that although Japan is a defeated country, it cannot be permanently prohibited from foreign trade. Once we understand this point, our concerns are largely unnecessary. As for the concern that a large number of Japanese goods may be dumped in China once Japanese trade is opened, there will be no problem as long as we strictly implement our import control policies. The reporter then asked whether opening Japanese foreign trade would conflict with the government's current barter trade policy with Japan. Luo said that the barter trade policy is conducted between governments and is fundamentally different in nature from general ordinary trade. Moreover, the goods imported from Japan under the current barter trade policy have all been designated by our government in advance and are all essential goods. Therefore, the barter trade policy will continue without conflict after the official opening of trade with Japan and will not cause any harm.

### Loose Money Supply and Low Interest Rates: Chinese Stocks Maintain Trading Range

Chinese stocks fell again yesterday. Many major players in the industry were short sellers and took advantage of the high pressure from news of Japanese silk exports, which was considered unfavorable to Mei Ya. Short covering from the previous day reappeared at high prices, and the fragile stock market was ultimately forced to submit. Short sellers rampaged, long positions surrendered, and the market showed great weakness midway through the day. At noon, despite the extremely loose money supply and low overnight interest rates of around one corner, without the support of buyers, there was a slight rebound, but the market ended within a trading range.

The morning opened high, and after the opening, Mei Ya numbers 231 and 171 were bought, while numbers 142, 223, 185, 24, 94, 14, and 143 were sold.

Numbers 223, 134, 36, and 35 resold, and number 14 even sold current Mei Ya, causing the current delivery price of Mei Ya to fall further to 473 yuan. After 9:45 AM, numbers 40, 8, 231, 42, and 152 took advantage of the low prices to buy up to 484 yuan. Numbers 235, 36, 85, 24, 232, 65, and 149 came to close positions again. Li An first hung low to the limit down at 10:10 AM, causing Mei Ya to fall to a low price of 460 yuan. Current delivery has already been squared at this point. Xin He was sold by numbers 160, 35, 235, 163, and 181, forcing the price down to 2800 yuan and 2820 yuan. The Xin Guang Luban Road store department on the third floor lost their caution. Number 218 and retail investors all sold, causing the spot market to fall to a low of 162 yuan and the forward market to a low of 163 yuan. Jing Fu was simultaneously pressured down to 143 yuan. Numbers 160, 237, 137 sub-branch, and 163 bought. At 11:15 AM, Mei Ya rebounded to 480 yuan, while numbers 84, 69, 179, 104, and 4 sold, causing the price to fall back to 468 yuan. Numbers 157, 232, and 8 bought. With the loose money supply and low overnight interest rates of around one corner, people's spirits were slightly lifted, and Mei Ya rebounded to 485 yuan. Numbers 84 and 197 increased their holding in Xin He. Number 152 slightly increased their holding of current Xin He, pushing the price up to around 3030 yuan after 12:00 PM. Numbers 219, 76, 117, 97, and 60 continued to pressure the market. Numbers 106 and 85 also sold current Mei Ya, causing the price to fall again to below 470 yuan before closing. Xin He was also closed by numbers 157 and 133, falling to around 2900 yuan, and the market ended within a trading range. After closing, Mei Ya was bought by numbers 223, 160, and 231, with short positions covering, and the price was called up to around 475 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, spot stocks Xin Guang, Xin He, Qin Xing, and Xin Hua did not fall much. Mei Ya, Hua Chang, Zhong Fa, and Yong Gong each fell by half a percentage point. Nei Yi, Da Tong, Rong Feng, Match, Cement, and Jing Lun were flat. Xin Ya, Zhong Fang, and Tong Yi each fell by around half a percentage point. Li An rebounded after hitting the limit down, falling by less than 20%. The remaining stocks fell slightly.

### Heavy Selling Pressure and Frequent Disposals: Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Fall Again: 42-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Drops Another 200,000 Yuan

In yesterday's cotton yarn market, the price of yarn offered by Fang Jian Company has been reduced. The listed price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was lowered to 16.8 million yuan for sale. Buyers in the market were hesitant, and cloth factories and dyeing factories were also watching. In the end, due to heavy selling pressure, the price of 42-count Blue Phoenix was 17 million yuan, a further decrease of 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse was 11.4 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan.

Fang Jian Distributes Yarn

[This Newspaper] China Fang Jian Company distributed a total of 728 pieces of yarn yesterday on behalf of the Textile Adjustment Association, all of which were distributed to manufacturers. There were a total of 118 applications.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially showed some promise. Longtou fine cloth once traded higher, but then market sentiment weakened and interest waned. Due to strict controls on this street and a lack of new buyers, and because out-of-town buyers were losing money on the market, there was little activity. Disposals in the market exceeded purchases, and market sentiment collapsed. In the end, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell to 428,000 yuan, a decrease of 4,000 yuan from the previous day. Various grades of fine cloth, such as Wufu Color Ball and Yang He, also fell by 1,000 to 560 yuan. Sijunzi gabardine business was slow and fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Yin Guang bleached cloth sales were also sluggish, falling by 10,000 yuan. Only Yi Ding Ruyi rose by 5,000 yuan, while the market for other colored cloths and Shilin cloth remained stable.

[This Newspaper] The business department of the Textile Adjustment Association is scheduled to convene a meeting with local cotton cloth merchants at 4:00 PM tomorrow. It is reported that the pricing of cotton cloth will be discussed.

### Spot Cotton Trading Improves

Yesterday, spot cotton trading improved due to strong demand from yarn factories in other regions. Prices for high-grade cotton remained weak as fine yarn sales were not strong and yarn factories were less interested in buying. Raw materials for coarse yarn below 20 counts, such as Nantai Cang and Huoji, were in strong demand from local yarn factories, and sales were strong. Prices remained firm, and the trend seemed very stable. Prices offered to factories for each grade were: Brazilian, 2.3 million yuan; Huoji, 1.72 million yuan, 1.73 million yuan. Warehouse prices were: Ling Bao, 2.12 million yuan, 2.13 million yuan, 2.2 million yuan; Han Fine, 2.08 million yuan; Huoji, 1.72 million yuan; Nantai Cang, 1.86 million yuan.

### Financial Control Matters: Only Persistence Can Achieve Results

[This Newspaper] In order to cooperate with the General Mobilization Order, the Ministry of Finance plans to strengthen financial control measures in three areas: (1) controlling the financial market, (2) strengthening the management of banks and money houses, and (3) cracking down on speculative trading. The reporter specifically consulted Li Li, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, for his opinion. According to him, matters related to financial control must be implemented regularly and consistently in order to achieve the greatest results. The new control guidelines formulated by the Ministry of Finance will make the financial system more concrete. He believes that the main focus of financial control at present is to crack down on the black market for gold, banknotes, and foreign exchange. The Ministry of Finance and this department have recently been conducting regular inspections of various banks and money houses, and the main purpose is to actively help them get their money operations on the right track, rather than passively cracking down on them.

### Zhang Yaozhang Returns to Shanghai from India to Discuss the Production and Sales of Indian Cotton; Production Is Gradually No Longer Important to Our Country's Market

Among the Chinese companies that have established branches in India, the Renren Enterprise Company was the first. Zhang Yaozhang, the business manager of the company, went to Mumbai last November to establish a branch. After spending eight months in India and traveling to major cities such as Quanli, Gardarda, etc., to investigate the Indian cotton market, he recently returned to China. Zhang said: Before World War II, the average annual cotton production in India was about 6 million bales. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, cotton production decreased significantly due to the concentration of efforts on increasing food production. Therefore, 1941 can be said to be a turning point in Indian cotton production. It decreased to 4.7 million bales in 1942, increased to 5.26 million bales after 1943, decreased to 3.5 million bales in 1944, and was only 3.4 million bales in 1945 and 1946. Before the war, Japan was the largest customer of Indian cotton, importing about 1.6 million to 2 million bales annually, followed by China. In 1930, the highest amount of Indian cotton exported to China was 1.6 million bales. Later, due to the increase in cotton production in our country, imports decreased year by year. Before the July 7th Incident, the amount of Indian cotton exported to China was negligible. After the fall of Shanghai, there was a slight improvement, increasing to 750,000 bales. Afterwards, it was interrupted again due to the severance of maritime transportation. Last year, Indian cotton exports to China were 450,000 bales, accounting for one-third of India's total exports. This year, our country is no longer an ideal market for Indian cotton. Because Japan is under the control of MacArthur, all textile raw materials depend on the United States, so currently, the sales channels for Indian cotton are only small European countries such as Spain, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia, with extremely small sales volumes. Currently, there are 1.5 million bales of cotton in Mumbai alone. In order to maintain the negotiated price and prevent a cotton industry crisis, the Indian government has automatically purchased 190,000 bales. Starting at the end of June, the government further abolished export control regulations to stimulate cotton prices. India has extremely strict import controls, and the sales of Chinese silk in India are very limited. Among the Chinese goods exported to India, there are six main categories, especially green beans, which are the most. The second is industrial products, such as thermos bottles and steel needles. However, due to the high cost, sales are quite difficult. Zhang had many impressions of India and said that we should no longer discriminate against India, and this incorrect view should be changed. Because at present, India's light and heavy industries are larger in scale than those of our country, and its import and export trade is also larger than that of China.

### The Export Promotion Committee Sends Personnel to Inspect the Actual Situation of Sichuan and Guangdong Raw Silk

[Central News Agency, This City News] The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee previously decided at its 15th meeting that the purchase and expansion of sales of raw silk from Sichuan and Guangdong provinces should be carried out in accordance with the raw silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and entrusted the China Silk Company to formulate a purchase plan. It is now learned that before formulating a plan, the company must first send personnel to the silk-producing areas to investigate costs and actual conditions before making preparations. It has also sent letters to relevant authorities, such as the National Bank, the China Trust Bureau, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee, to jointly dispatch representatives to participate. The above letters were sent out on the morning of the 23rd. It is also learned that the annual output of raw silk (including native silk) in Sichuan and Guangdong is about 10,000 dan each. The quality of Sichuan silk is better than that of Guangdong silk, so the current market price of Guangdong silk is only 60-70% of the price of products from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, while Sichuan silk is 80-90%. However, Guangdong silk is intentionally improved. This spring, the China Silk Company issued 3,000 new varieties for trial cultivation, and the results are excellent. Sichuan has a seed-producing farm that can produce 500,000 sheets of silkworm eggs in spring and autumn, but most of them are old varieties, and new varieties account for only a small number.

### Anhui Roasted Green Tea Is Selling Well

In recent days, the domestic sales of red and green tea have been gradually increasing, and especially this year's Anhui roasted green tea is becoming more and more active with the help of merchants, and the price is showing a trend of rising due to people's confidence. As for the foreign tea market, the Wuchang Tea Company continues to absorb low-grade old red tea. For other varieties such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, which are sold to Africa, buyers are less eager than before because the French Yongxing Foreign Company recently reached an agreement with overseas merchants for 900 tons of green tea, and the current demand is gradually being met. However, holders of goods, considering that the market inventory is not abundant, generally intend to sell at higher prices, so the process is somewhat characterized by both supply and demand being quiet. Although transactions have become less frequent, the market is still sharp.

### World Fuel Conference to Be Held in The Hague

[This Newspaper News] The World Fuel Conference is scheduled to be held in The Hague on September 1st this year to discuss the coordination of world fuel production and sales issues. It is reported that our country will send Liu Tingfang and Chen Kecheng as representatives to attend.

### The Four-Bank Joint Inspection Team Departs Yesterday in Eight Groups to Conduct Work to Verify the Use of Loans by Various Factories

[This Newspaper News] The Four-Bank Joint Headquarters Inspection Team departed yesterday in eight groups to conduct work, going to various loan factories to verify the use of loans. So far, there are more than 600 loan-receiving manufacturers, and it is expected that the inspection can be completed in two months. The eight groups that departed yesterday were assigned two people each from the 16 inspectors dispatched by the group from various banks and bureaus to conduct inspections.

In addition, the Shanghai branch of the headquarters held a meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday in the conference room of the Central Bank, attended by more than ten people including Xu Weiming, Wang Zishuang, Diao Minren, and Li Zhuanzai. They reviewed 14 loan applications with a total loan amount of more than 20 billion yuan, and signed and submitted their review opinions to the headquarters for approval. In addition, they reviewed the current financial and economic situation in Shanghai.

### Food Grain Weakens and Is Powerless; Xian Rice Falls Close to Rationing Price

Yesterday, more than 4,700 shi of rice arrived in the north and south markets. The price of Zhongguan xian rice has fallen close to the rationing price. The shops' appetite has moved slightly, and both japonica and xian yuan rice have seen an increase of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. However, softening was still seen at noon, and new xian rice from Lanxi, Zhejiang, has arrived in Shanghai.

Due to the imminent resumption of normal flour rationing, actual sales are very sluggish, and the price has plummeted by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Wheat bran has fallen by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales are flat, down by 1,000 yuan. Yingkou cake is temporarily flat. Yellow bean appetite is not good, Hankou zha beans and Du Huang are down by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, but Northeast soybeans are still relatively stable.

Green beans continue to rise in price. New Sichuan green beans have arrived in Shanghai. Red beans are selling well, rising by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Field peas are flat. Not much sorghum has arrived, and the price is strong. High-quality goods have increased by 10 to 20 yuan, while medium and low quality goods are mediocre. Corn has no changes.

Raw peanuts are seeing a decline in demand from foreign firms, and the price has plummeted by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Broad beans are gradually retreating. Arrivals are surging, digestion is sluggish, it is difficult to find buyers, and the price continues to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Due to the decline in the flour market, factories' appetite for wheat is weak, falling by a small amount of 1,000 yuan, and the future trend looks short. The oil market digestion is average, raw oil is down by 10,000 yuan, soybean oil is flat, vegetable oil is down by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and sesame oil is 600,000 yuan, and the price of both clear and turbid sesame oil has been raised.

### Large Quantities of Food Supervision Internally Transported

[This Newspaper News] Recently, large quantities of food supervision goods from Tianjin and Shandong have been transported to the Yangtze River. According to estimates by the shipping industry, 150,000 tons have been transported to Pukou, Wuhu, Hankou, Changsha, and other places this month to date. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau's Haihang ship transported 1,200 tons of Jiuda Jingjian from Tianjin to Shanghai, 600 tons to Nanjing, and 600 tons to be unloaded in Shanghai.

### Gasoline Allocation in This City: Priority and Sequence Determined

Representatives from the four major companies, Mobil, Texaco, Asia Petroleum, and China Petroleum, attended. At yesterday's meeting, the principles and priorities for gasoline allocation were determined. It is reported that in the priority sequence, public utilities rank first, followed by automobiles, and then various industries that use gasoline as raw material.

### Cigarette Market Atmosphere Is Depressed

Yesterday's cigarette market situation was that at the beginning of the day, the Fuxin Company universally distributed "Red Gold" brand cigarettes to each store, with a distribution price of 30,000 yuan per pack. The Nanyang Tobacco Company also distributed "Great Bank" brand cigarettes, 150 packs to grade A peers, with a total distribution price of 4.8 million yuan, 100 packs to grade B, and 50 packs to grade C. There were ample chips, and due to the hot weather, the quality of the cigarettes was also becoming ethereal, and the market was quiet. In the afternoon, due to the absorption of low prices, ten British cigarettes rose to 8.8 million yuan, a daily increase of 40,000 yuan. Old Knife was 7.35 million yuan, up 30,000 yuan. The overall trend for the day was that popular goods such as Million Gold Brandy Axe rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while the market prices of other brands fell due to the distribution of goods. American goods such as Camel Six Horsepower and 50-piece canned cigarettes had very abundant sources, and the market was in a slump.

### Shaoyang Demonstration Factory: Watching the Growth of the Seedlings of Rural Industry

— Hengyang, 18th (Air Dispatch) — Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru

Industrialization is a universally recognized way to save the country, but we are an agricultural country that is based on agriculture. Farmers account for 80% of the national population. While saving the country through industry is justifiable, we cannot ignore the countryside and should devote ourselves to rural industrialization, building the foundation of industry in the countryside. Otherwise, indulging in the fantasy of the development of urban industry, thinking that it is the way to save the country, is abandoning the fundamentals and reversing the priorities, and in the end, we will deviate from the ideal harvest.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) was established. Its work focused not only on passively relieving the inevitable disasters but also on restoring and rebuilding, especially the heavy reconstruction of the vast countryside that had been ravaged by war. Therefore, in 1945, Mr. Jiang Tingfu, the former director of CRRRA, discussed with Mr. Clemont, the head of rural industry at UNRRA, and decided to establish a constructive organization under CRRRA. UNRRA provided a large amount of equipment and dispatched technical personnel to China for joint cooperation, to assist local small-scale industries in their restoration and to establish demonstration factories as a trial for constructing rural industry, gradually promoting it to guide the backward countryside to gradually industrialize and enter the realm of science.

On May 1, 1946, the organizational regulations for the Rural Industrial Demonstration Group were approved. CRRRA sent expert Dr. Jiang Guanghui, together with UNRRA experts, to conduct on-site inspections, selecting Shaoyang in Hunan and Qujiang in Guangdong as the first phase of work areas. The Shaoyang area began that year, and the group headquarters was officially established in May.

After the group headquarters was established, it began to requisition land, build factories, and transport equipment. At the same time, in order to cooperate with foreign engineers, it specially requested the establishment of technical training classes to cultivate cadres in preparation for future promotion work. The first phase recruited 14 graduates from university science and engineering colleges and 6 high school students, and the second phase recruited 12 high school students, who were assigned to learn from foreign engineers. It also conducted detailed investigations into the resources, transportation, and original small industrial production conditions in the neighboring areas of Shaoyang and Qujiang, in order to serve as a reference for future work promotion. In November of the same year, foreign factory engineers arrived in Shaoyang one after another, and the factory construction project began.

A Glimpse of the First Completed Mother Factory: The Mechanical Factory

In February of this year, the first factory to be completed was the mechanical factory, located near the Shaoyang East Bus Station at the group headquarters. This factory specializes in producing the necessary machinery for each factory to meet the needs of each factory, so it can be called the mother factory. The machinery and equipment allocated by UNRRA began to arrive in September 1946, and a temporary workshop was first built in front of the group headquarters. When the factory building was completed in February of this year, the equipment was increased, and it was officially established.

The factory has a power house, equipped with two 15-kilowatt generators and two 30-kilowatt generators, providing electricity for lighting the group headquarters and power for the entire factory. There are four large and small lathes, one planer, one milling machine, and four presses. Other equipment includes dozens of types of AC and DC electric motors, air compressors, hydraulic presses, and electric grinders. Although they are small tools, they are all the most standard machines from the American wartime, which are widely used and convenient to construct. Expansion is currently planned, with the addition of one long-stroke planer and one universal welding bed. The foundry originally used a 500-pound iron melting furnace, but now the output is insufficient, and it is planned to add a one-ton melting furnace. The small mold shop is also planning to expand.

This factory specializes in supplying machinery to various factories, so its business is purely internal. Now, in order to expand external business, it plans to repair and assemble parts for various private factories and manufacture a large number of rice milling machines and oil presses to meet the needs of rural farmers.

Cement, Sulfuric Acid, and Fertilizer: Three Factories Completed

The cement, sulfuric acid, and fertilizer factories were completed one after another this year.

The cement factory among the three is set up using small-scale production methods, and its equipment includes: (1) a 5×5 horizontal large tube boiler; (2) a 25HP steam engine; (3) a 15KVA generator; (4) a jaw crusher; (5) a ball mill; (6) a mixer; (7) a blower; and (8) a cement vertical kiln.

The raw material for cement is limestone taken from near the factory, which has the highest calcium chloride content, and the magnesium chloride and sulfide content is extremely low. The nearby clay has abundant silicon and iron chloride content, which can be called a high-quality raw material for cement. Because the factory was established not long ago, its current output cannot meet the needs of the Shaoyang market. It is now planning to add a 100-horsepower boiler and engine, and increase vertical kilns and grinding equipment, with the goal of producing 100 bags per day (each bag is about 100 jin).

The sulfuric acid factory is located on Wutaishan, outside the East Gate. The factory was designed by American engineer Mr. Caricoporez, who participated in the US Army Rural Industry Department's experimental work in South America, so he has rich experience. The factory will use the aluminum chamber method, which is the most economical small sulfuric acid factory. The only important material is lead sheet, and various equipment requires this. However, the output of Hunan's blue lead has been extremely small since the war. After many attempts, 10 tons were purchased from the Hunan Lead Smelting Plant, and the Hengyang Yongsheng Chemical Plant was entrusted to press them into sheets for application. The required acid-resistant bricks are replaced by refractory bricks produced by the Lingling China Industry Company, which are still suitable.

The factory is equipped with: (1) a sulfur burner, with a total of three furnace chambers, which is a dual-purpose sulfur and iron burner. At the beginning of the construction, only one sulfur burner was used; (2) a dust removal chamber with a volume of 20 cubic feet; (2) a denitration tower with a volume of 37.5 cubic feet; (4) five lead chambers, each with a volume of four cubic feet supported by cable stays, and a cooling area of 160 square feet; (5) three nitration towers, each with a volume of 25 cubic feet; (6) three acid pumps (acid eggs); (7) a small steam boiler; (8) an air compressor; and (9) a chimney. In addition to the above items, other equipment such as acid-receiving ponds, water supply devices, water pumps, generators, electric lights, telephones, and measuring instruments are fully equipped and can be used. Because coking has not yet started, the manufactured sulfuric acid is being planned to be concentrated and temporarily supplied to the market. This equipment can be completed before the end of this month.

The raw material source was originally sulfur taken from Shuikoushan in Changning, but the supply there is not smooth and the price is too high. It is planned to use iron pyrite as raw material to reduce costs. There is not much production of this mineral in Shaoyang, and the sulfur content is not high, which is difficult to meet the requirements. Recently, a batch was purchased in Xiangxiang, and the trial results were satisfactory, so the future raw material supply will probably be dominated by Xiangxiang.

The current output is about 1,000 pounds per day, which is worth about 4 million yuan at market prices. It can be increased to 2,000 pounds in a few days. The sales are currently only supplying the needs of the Shaoyang market, and the rest is kept for self-use. There are many orders from all parties, and there is a trend of (difficulty in meeting demand).

The fertilizer factory is located on Shangqiang on the west bank of the Shaoshui River. In January of this year, UNRRA sent sanitary engineer Mr. R. Stone to Shaoyang to start work. The fertilizer department project was completed at the end of April, ten public toilets in Shaoyang were completed at the end of May, and part of the drinking water supply project was completed at the end of June.

The fertilizer adopted by the factory uses the continuous operation fermentation method. The fermentation time is about 20 days in summer and 40 days in winter. During this fermentation period, due to the high temperature and gradual reduction of moisture, most of the bacteria and parasites such as dysentery, cholera, typhoid, roundworms, and whipworms originally stored in the feces die. This can reduce the spread of diseases. Furthermore, the fermentation of these fertilizers is carried out in airtight rooms, so the loss of contained gases is also small, and an appropriate amount of bone meal and straw are added, which increases the phosphorus and calcium, which are needed by plants and are uniquely lacking in feces. This is much better than the old composting method in our country.

The factory is equipped with (1) two sedimentation ponds with a capacity of 1,500 gallons; (2) two septic tanks with a capacity of 4,500 gallons; (3) six waste ponds with a capacity of 13,800 gallons; (4) two separate septic tanks with a capacity of 14,600 gallons.

Shaoyang farmland originally used feces as the main fertilizer. Farmers often travel dozens of miles, spending three or four days, to buy feces in the urban area. Now, the fertilizer produced by the factory is fermented and resolved into a viscous black solid. After being dried in the drying yard, its area and weight are greatly reduced, making it easy to transport, and the fertilizer effect is higher than raw manure. However, conservative farmers use it only after it has been mixed, and there are few adopters.

Refining and Rice Milling Factories Are Undergoing Innovation

What is described above are the four factories that have been completed and are in operation. In fact, the factories planned by the Shaoyang Rural Industrial Demonstration Group are not limited to this. Currently, the equipment is being improved in three factories: rice milling, oil pressing, and sugar making. The traditional methods are being researched and improved in two factories: leather making and papermaking. These factories that are being planned are urgently needed in the countryside, especially oil pressing, sugar making, leather making, and papermaking. If effective results can be seen in the future, they will make a great contribution to rural industry. Oil pressing is the most common in rural areas; sugar making in the sugarcane-producing areas of Shaoyang and Yuping in Hunan is the only side business for farmers, which is as important as sericulture in the villages of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Leather making is a special industry in Shaoyang and Changde; papermaking is an important industry in the villages of Shaoyang, Xinhua, Liuyang, and Taoyuan in Hunan. In paper-scarce China, if new papermaking methods can be applied, it is believed that these paper-producing areas will be able to produce a large amount to meet domestic needs and reduce a large amount of foreign exchange expenditure.

Judging from the current situation, the equipment of the Shaoyang industrial demonstration factories is still in its infancy, and the scale is pitifully small, but its future is limitless. The growth of this seedling will cause the conservative Chinese rural society, which has lasted for thousands of years, to step into the road of industrialization. It can also be said that it will be the driving force for building a new China. However, the success of any undertaking is not achieved overnight. Especially, the conservatism of the Chinese countryside is too strong, and the intellectual level of farmers is too low, making it difficult to accept new reforms. Taking fertilizer as an example, farmers are unwilling to give up their old methods of applying human and animal waste. Therefore, in addition to doing practical demonstration work, we must also carry out extensive publicity work. At the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that Chinese people are often enthusiastic at the beginning but lack perseverance. Looking at history, the "Westernization Movement" of Li Hongzhang 50 years ago was done in a grand manner at the time, but it failed later. Today's rural industrial demonstration, from the perspective of the countryside, its environment is no different from Li Hongzhang's "Westernization Movement" 50 years ago. If the government is not careful, it will become an impractical ornament, self-sufficient and self-destructive. The demonstration is just a name and will not generate any real power. It is said that the foreign experts who are responsible for guiding the various departments of the Shaoyang Demonstration Factory will all return to their countries at the end of the year. The demonstration group also has a plan to sell all of them to private companies after the factories have achieved considerable results. This plan is absolutely correct, and we do not need to discuss it. However, we want to suggest that everyone pay attention to the fact that the Rural Industrial Demonstration Factory must never fall into the hands of speculative market prices in the future; before foreign experts return to their countries, preparations should be made early to select talents, because the machines in the demonstration factory are all the latest American models. We are not self-deprecating, but looking at the phenomenon of Belgium receiving enemy and puppet factories and having to stop the factory chimneys from smoking due to the lack of technical personnel, we are really worried about the talents who will take over the work of foreign experts!

Tanggu New Port: Cross-Section and Explanation From Our Newspaper Information Office

### The Improvement of the Hai River and Dagukou Sandbar Engineering Is Urgently Needed

— Cui Deha

The preliminary plan for the Tanggu New Port project drafted by the Japanese was as early as before the July 7th Incident in 1937. In the author's opinion, the coast near Dagu is not suitable for building a shallow-water artificial seaport because the construction cost is very high. Revenue from ship sales, wharf fees, and mooring fees is not enough to repay the capital spent. Moreover, the new port silts up quickly and the maintenance costs are high. It is better to improve the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar, which is more cost-effective and has a greater effect. Therefore, the author believes that building a new port will disregard huge construction and maintenance costs. According to the author's deduction, the reasons for the Japanese to build this port are as follows:

(1) Political factors: The Japanese wanted a port completely free from foreign influence. According to the treaty provisions, the new port is north of the Dagukou waterway and not within the scope of Tianjin Port.

(2) Strategic factors may also be an important reason.

(3) The estimated construction cost is too low.

(4) Japanese engineers do not understand the local situation and the estimation of sediment deposition is inaccurate, resulting in an underestimation of maintenance costs.

(5) At that time, the navigation conditions on the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar were extremely poor.

After the war ended, the original situation fundamentally changed. A thorough study and comparison are necessary: one is to increase a huge amount of capital to build a new port to adapt to the new environment, and the other is to spend less capital to improve the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar to achieve better results. Which of the two is more economical?

The original plan for the new port was to build multiple docks to accommodate ships with a draft of five meters. Most of the port was reserved for coastal shallow-water steamships to transport coal, iron, and food to Japan from Tanggu.

It is a mistake from an economic point of view to spend huge amounts of capital to build artificial seaports for coastal shallow-water steamships because it costs less to improve Tianjin Port. Since water transport is cheaper than railway transport, cargo transport should make the most use of ships to load goods to the interior. Therefore, the goods should not be unloaded at Tanggu but be traced up the river to reach Tianjin.

The depth of the river was 4.3 meters at the beginning of 1938. After dredging, it reached 4.6 meters by the end of the year. From 1939 to 1947, the depth near Tianjin was from 4.9 meters to 5.2 meters. The maintenance of this depth comes from the scouring of the water flow. If you want to reach a depth of 5.5 meters, you only need to dredge slightly near Tianjin. After the straightening of the bends from Gegu and Nankai, a water depth of 6.2 meters can be obtained without the need for dredging. Because the silting in the low-lying areas upstream of Tianjin is successful, the Hai River sediment problem can be solved, and a better depth can be obtained without the need for frequent dredging. After the depth of the downstream channel of Tianjin is gradually improved, Tanggu and Dagu from Xinhe to the estuary can reach 9 meters. This favorable situation for navigation will enable ships to directly transport goods to Tianjin instead of unloading them in Tanggu.

The silting of Dagukou sandbar in 1937 and 1939 was the main reason for the engineers who did not understand the local situation to decide to build a new port. From 1927 to 1934, the silting of the Hai River was quite severe. From 1929 to 1939, the total amount of sediment was 56,500,000 cubic meters. The sediment was deposited on the sandbar at the estuary after being scoured by rapid currents. The sand surface was silted up quite a bit, and the depth of the channel was drastically reduced. In a period of 1937, the channel on Dagukou sandbar was only 3.1 meters at high tide, and in 1939 it was only 2.75 meters deep, but in December it increased to 4 meters again. Since then, the channel on the sandbar has gradually deepened. The depth in 1940 was 4.6 meters, in 1941 it was 5.2 meters, and in 1943 it was 5.8 meters. When the dredging work was stopped for several months around the time of the restoration, the depth was reduced to 4 meters again. By the end of June 1947, it could reach 4.9 meters after dredging. The situation on Dagukou sandbar has been greatly improved since 1939. The height of the beach was originally 0.3 meters above the Dagu zero point. After the scouring of the tide, it was 1.5 meters below the zero point by 1946. This situation is because the amount of sediment discharged from the Hai River and transported to Dagukou has been greatly reduced, and it will continue to improve in the future. Since 1927, the amount of sediment from the tributaries of the Hai River flowing into the Hai River has also been greatly reduced. In 1927, the amount of sediment entering the Hai River was 10,000,000 cubic meters, in 1928 it was 9,800,000 cubic meters, and in 1929 it was 14,500,000 cubic meters. However, in recent years, it has been reduced to 1,000,000 cubic meters per year. The amount of sediment and the sediment supplied by the other three tributaries are about 2-3 million cubic meters per year and will continue to decrease gradually. In the future, it will be easier to dredge and maintain the deep-water channel on Dagukou sandbar. If two dredgers continue dredging from July 1947, it can reach 5.5 meters within the year. If two suction dredgers are used according to the current method, it can reach 6.1 meters in May 1948.

If a breakwater is built south of the Tanggu New Port breakwater to concentrate the current between the two breakwaters, the average high tide depth of the channel on Dagukou sandbar can reach 7.6 meters. If dredging continues after the south breakwater is completed, the water depth can reach 8.5 meters. Larger ships that now need to anchor outside Dagukou sandbar can be diverted to Tanggu.

This improvement work can also be extended to Tianjin, so that the Hai River can navigate ships with a draft of 8 meters. If the silting of the Chaobai River, the Tuo River, and the Zhang River are successful, the amount of sediment entering the Hai River will be greatly reduced. This silting project can also have the effect of flood control.

If Tanggu New Port develops into a port accessible to foreign-going liners, it is economically feasible because Tanggu is located on the coast of the bay, with a superior location, making it easy to attract foreign ships to anchor here. In terms of the scope of the hinterland and the convenience of land and water transportation north of Shanghai, it is also superior to other North China ports.

The development of Tanggu New Port and the improvement of the Hai River, Dagukou, Dagukou New River, as well as the navigation channel of Tianjin Port, must be achieved in the most economical way to obtain the greatest commercial and transportation benefits.

The advantages and disadvantages of developing the two are compared as follows:

1. Tanggu New Port: Long breakwaters must be built on both sides of the channel near the mouth of the New Port, which requires huge construction costs. Moreover, a large amount of sediment silts up in the port every year, so it must be dredged from time to time. Although the dredging cost can be slightly reduced by using special machinery, the maintenance cost is still very high.

The freezing of Tanggu New Port in winter, which hinders navigation, is another disadvantage. Although the ice in the port can be broken up by icebreakers, these ice floes are not easy to flow out due to the weak tidal force. The advantage of the New Port is that it is isolated from the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar, and the water depth does not change from time to time due to the amount of sediment in the Hai River.

2. The development of Hai River, Tanggu, and Tianjin requires deepening the channel on Dagukou sandbar. The ships currently sailing on the Hai River are limited by the water depth of the channel on Dagukou sandbar, and the current depth of Tianjin Port is actually shallower than the channel on Dagukou. The improvement of the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar should be implemented in the following ways:

A. Dredge the channel on Dagukou sandbar to a depth of 4.9 meters so that it is equal to the current minimum depth of Tianjin Port.

B. Dredge the channel on Dagukou sandbar to a depth of 5.5 meters. Both plans A and B can be worked on in 1947 with two suction dredgers.

C. Dredge Tianjin Port to a depth of 5.5 meters. This improvement work can be completed in the autumn of 1947 with the current dredging equipment.

D. Urgently dredge the channel on Dagukou sandbar to a depth of 6.1 meters. This improvement work can be completed by the end of 1947.

The advantages of the above improvement procedures are:

(1) Suitable for current transportation needs, because most of the goods transported to Tanggu and Tianjin are coastal steamships with a draft of 5.5 meters to 8.1 meters.

(2) The improvement is carried out using existing equipment, and the cost is extremely low.

(3) The force of the tide is enough to carry the sand into the sea, without the need for constant dredging.

It is clear which is more cost-effective and time-saving to improve Dagukou sandbar and the Hai River than to spend huge amounts of money to build a new port only for shallow-water steamships to dock.

The Hai River should be dredged to a depth of eight feet, straight to Tianjin. Even if the cost is more than building a new port, it is still recommended for long-term planning. Dredging an inland harbor's channel to the sea is often costly, but this alone is not enough reason to abandon the inland harbor and build a new port on the coast. For example, the Bremen port on the Weser River in Germany is 65 kilometers from the sea. In the past, the river was shallow, with a depth of only 7.0 meters. After dredging, it can now navigate ships with a draft of 8.4 meters. Another port was built at the estuary to accommodate a few ocean liners with a draft of more than 8.4 meters. However, the cost of the former dredging project is far more than the latter. Another example is the Glasgow port on the Clyde River in England. In the past, the depth was only three feet at high tide. At that time, a ship and theory believed that it was impossible to improve it to accommodate large ships. Therefore, a new port was built at the estuary. However, the result was that the new port project was abandoned, and the Clyde River dredging project was very effective. The width of the Clyde River increased from 135 feet to 450 feet, and the water depth increased from 5 feet to 30 feet. Another example is the Seine River in France. Huge sums of money were spent on dredging between the estuary and Rouen, 76 miles away, to allow large steamships to enter and exit. Its estuary port, Le Havre, is for deep-water ships to anchor.

The river channel of the Hai River in Tianjin has now been improved from 56 feet to 17 feet, and the river width has increased from 220 feet to 325 feet. Therefore, there should be no difficulty in further improvement to a river depth of 26 feet and a river width of 450 feet. In this way, most of the ships currently anchored outside Dagukou can go directly to Tianjin. The above examples of the Weser River, the Clyde River, and the Seine River can be applied to Tianjin and Dagukou in the same way. Therefore, dredging the Hai River and developing Tianjin Port is more important than building a Dagukou New Port to accommodate shallow-water liners. Moreover, if ocean liners can travel 60 kilometers upstream to reach Tianjin, the huge commercial benefits are enough to offset the cost of harnessing the Hai River and more.

The situation of the Hai River and Dagukou sandbar has greatly improved since the construction of the new port was discussed in 1937. The congestion of the river channel and the estuary has become a thing of the past due to the full control. The construction of Tanggu New Port and the harnessing of the Hai River should be carried out simultaneously, and coordinated by experienced engineers. A conclusion can be drawn: it would be a big mistake to ignore the Hai River and only focus on the new port.

### America's Forty-Ninth Star: The Restructuring of Hawaii

— Translated by Zhang Zikang from U.S. News & World Report

The issue of adding Hawaii as the 49th state to the United States passed the U.S. Congress with a vote of 196 to 133 last month on the 30th. Now it is only waiting for the House of Representatives to agree and the President to sign it into law, then it will become a reality.

Before the issue of Hawaii becoming a state, the United States launched a verbal debate. When Hawaii's Congressional Representative Farrigton raised this issue, he said: Hawaii has a population of 519,000, more than the states of Nevada, Delaware, Colorado, Vermont, or New Hampshire. Although the population on the island is complex, with Japanese people accounting for one-third, these Japanese people have proven to be very loyal after the test of this war. Hawaii pays more federal taxes each year than fourteen of the forty-six states. It pays heavy taxes, but not only does it not have congressional representation, but it is also regarded as an "uncivilized" region, and its uniquely produced sugar is partially restricted.

In addition to presenting many reasons, Farrigton also skillfully used words to win the sympathy of his fellow Republicans behind the scenes. He said: (1) If the Republican Party's proposal to make Hawaii a state in 1944 had been successful, it would have benefited the party's election campaign in 1948. (2) The Republican Party's support of Hawaii's statehood would earn it the reputation of not discriminating against race among the northern cities. (3) Hawaii traditionally has Republican blood, and Hawaii's statehood will definitely produce two more Republican members of the House of Representatives.

Farrigton even talked about the issue of the American flag. He said that if Hawaii becomes a state, it will not hinder the traditional symmetry and propriety of the arrangement of the American flag. He provided three styles for Congress to refer to. (See attached picture)

He opposed the idea that Hawaii could not become a state under the unlimited education of the United States. He hoped to see the action performance of the American fair spirit. He said that if the United States agrees to Hawaii's request, it can give a clear impression to any region in the Pacific and the Far East, that is, the United States is cultivating the seeds of democracy everywhere.

However, there were also those who opposed Farrigton's argument. Republican Sabos said: "Hawaii's statehood will guarantee the extension of the financial monopoly of the five major families on the island." Republican Menasha said: "The Brezhnev forces lurking in Hawaiian farmers may elect two 'C.I.O.' (American left-wing industrial workers' union) members of Congress."

Democrat Georgia said: "Does it mean letting 180,000 Japanese people on the island enjoy the same political rights as American citizens?"

But in any case, the issue of Hawaii becoming a state has been passed by Congress. According to the speculation of Nebraska, the chairman of the House Land Committee: the fact of Hawaii becoming a state is expected to be realized this year. His personal opinion is: Hawaii is 2,400 miles away from San Francisco, so it is best to list it as an administrative region of California. Now, Nebraska's personal opinion is left aside for the time being. It seems that the final passage of Hawaii's statehood is not a problem. The problem is, what about the arrangement of the American flag? In addition to the following three types, are there any better arrangements? Readers, guess?

The Mystery of the Forty-Ninth Star on the American Flag

Recently, Hawaii has been resolved by the U.S. Congress to be changed into one of the states of the United States. I don't know how this forty-ninth star will be placed on the American flag: will it be arranged according to the upper picture, the middle picture, or the lower picture?

### Victory Song of Eastern Longdong: Iron and Blood Strength to Stabilize the Northwest

— Qinghai 20th by Airmail, by Xu Tangying

Eastern Longdong is a pocket-shaped mountainous region bordering Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. Strategically, it is a vital chokepoint with a dense population and flourishing crops. Unfortunately, many areas in this region have been ravaged by destructive and murderous communist bandits who have occupied them for over a decade, leaving ten out of ten houses empty and the land barren. In broad daylight, one often sees naked young girls and children, and even adults struggle to maintain proper attire. While such sights may exist elsewhere, they are not as prevalent and deeply ingrained as in Eastern Longdong. In April of this year, the National Army's 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade arrived from Qinghai to garrison the area, stationed in Qinyang, Heshui, and Ningxian, closely monitoring and preventing the westward advance of the communist bandits. Upon arriving in Eastern Longdong, the first thing the 82nd Division and its units witnessed was the tragic situation of the people under years of oppressive communist rule and brutal cruelty. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 82nd Division took special care of the people, refraining from occupying civilian houses, using civilian goods, or conscripting civilian laborers during their relocation. This earned them high praise from the people, which was rare in the past. Previously, when the communist bandits occupied Eastern Longdong, they not only took food and clothing from the people but also forcibly requisitioned shoes, socks, and fodder. All items taken by the communist bandits were never paid for. Under such blatant exploitation, the people of Eastern Longdong had a very negative impression of the communist bandits and believed that soldiers were entitled to take everything without compensation. However, after the National Army's 82nd Division arrived, under the strict discipline of Commander Ma Shaoxiang and his benevolent treatment of the people, all transactions were conducted fairly. This already moved the people of Eastern Longdong to tears of gratitude. When the National Army even paid for the firewood and grass they used at prices higher than the market rate, the people felt it was a miracle. In just over a month, their love and respect for the National Army grew increasingly earnest. This clearly demonstrates the depth of the communist bandits' exploitation of the people of Eastern Longdong over the past decade.

Furthermore, although the communist bandits constantly chanted slogans of democracy and freedom in Eastern Longdong, in reality, they were extremely autocratic and tyrannical. They arbitrarily used pretexts to kill local gentry and village chiefs, accusing them of being Kuomintang spies or providing firewood and grass to the Chiang Kai-shek army. They used intimidation, oppression, and murder to control the people, leaving their lives completely unprotected. At the same time, they absolutely forbade the people from speaking out. We often saw people being brutally murdered for occasionally discussing the Communist Party. When they spoke to each other, even without a third party present, they would cover their ears to speak to those they trusted. If you asked the local people about the past, they would simply weep silently. Therefore, we simply cannot understand how the Communist Party's behavior differs from Qin Shi Huang's "even discussing is punishable by death".

Cities Can Be Conquered, But Not Hearts

When the National Army first arrived in Eastern Longdong, the officers and soldiers were somewhat wary and suspicious of the people of Eastern Longdong, who had been subjected to over a decade of communist indoctrination. However, the facts told us that the honest and hardworking nature of the people of Eastern Longdong remained pure and flawless, and they were all able to follow good examples and steadfastly adhere to what is right. They all had a fair judgment in their hearts and had not lost their conscience to distinguish between right and wrong. When they saw the strict military discipline and the deep care for the people displayed by the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade, they immediately knew who were the armies serving the country and the people, and who were the bandits harming the country and the people. Therefore, they decided to choose what was right and support the National Army's 82nd Division to fight against their enemy, the Communist Party. This was the revival of the conscience of the people of Eastern Longdong, and it was also the great achievement of the National Army's 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade, who rescued the people of Eastern Longdong from the depths of misery. Therefore, the National Army loved the people, and the people were close to the army. At the same time, they poured out their hearts and did their best to help. This spirit of the army and the people working together to defend the country was especially evident in the Battle of Heshui. When the communist bandit Wang Zizai led his 12th Brigade to attack Heshui, our defending force consisted of only 600 officers and soldiers of the 8th Cavalry Brigade led by Ma Shengzhi. The disparity in numbers made it difficult to fulfill the defense mission. However, the National Army's 82nd Division used all available civilian manpower. On May 29th, when the communists attacked Heshui, many compatriots had already come from afar to report the movements, numbers, weapons, and other intelligence of the communist bandits to the National Army, allowing the National Army to prepare calmly and be confident of victory. Once the war broke out fiercely, tens of thousands of communist bandits swarmed from all over the mountains and fields, besieging the city walls of Heshui with intense firepower. Our army, led by Ma Shengzhi, fought bravely, repelling the enemy with one against a hundred, and managed to defend the city walls for three days. Initially, when our National Army fought the enemy, the people of Eastern Longdong were intimidated by the large number of communist bandits and had no faith in the National Army's ability to win with fewer troops. However, when the National Army soldiers fought bravely and charged into battle, causing the communist bandits to repeatedly lose battles and hesitate to advance, the people of Eastern Longdong believed that the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 82nd Division were indeed elite troops of national defense and were sure to win. This confidence was strengthened and established. Therefore, they went from sympathizing with the National Army to admiring the National Army, and from admiring the National Army to actually helping the National Army. Therefore, in the battlefield where bullets flew and flesh and blood were scattered, they risked their lives, regardless of gender or age, and voluntarily cooked meals and fed fodder to the fighting National Army soldiers. Because the cooks and grooms who were on internal duty at this time had all reinforced the front lines to fight and could not come down to cook, all the internal duties were taken over by them. They not only made tea and delivered food and fodder to the National Army, but also cared for the wounded, bandaging their wounds, and became nurses and stretcher-bearers for the National Army. At this time, the defense force of Heshui was no longer the battalion led by Ma Shengzhi, but the entire city of Heshui, united in spirit. In the end, they annihilated more than 5,000 stubborn bandits, and their main force was also defeated. As the saying goes, "When everyone is of one mind, even a mountain can be moved." This can be said to be a realistic portrayal of the army and the people of Heshui in this great battle to defend Heshui.

Helping the Local Government Rebuild the Political and Educational Systems of Eastern Longdong

The National Army's 82nd Division was not only able to win the hearts of the people and defeat the enemy, but also did a lot of great work in Eastern Longdong. Now that the crops are ripe, the army is helping the people harvest their fields. When the people are hungry, the National Army generously provides relief. After recovering Pankezhen, the National Army seized a large amount of grain from the communist army and distributed it unconditionally to the local poor people. In order to get to the root of the problem and eliminate the bandits, they cooperated with the local government to organize Baojia. In this regard, the results were great. At the same time, due to years of war in various parts of Eastern Longdong, the local area was impoverished, and the government had almost no time to care for education. Therefore, it was difficult for all schools to maintain themselves. Seeing this situation, Commander Ma Shaoxiang generously donated money to subsidize them, allowing education in Eastern Longdong to regain vitality. These few major events were truly the greatest happiness for the people of Eastern Longdong.

After the Battle of Heshui, tens of thousands of refugees immediately appeared in Eastern Longdong. Although the National Army has done its utmost to provide relief, the central government still needs to find a way. In addition, the National Army's cavalry damaged civilian fields due to the war. General Ma Shaoxiang believed that this was an unprovoked loss for the people, so he specially allocated 12 million yuan as compensation for the landowners' losses. The people were moved to tears when they received the compensation.

Strengthening the National Army's Equipment to Strive for Greater Victory

Most of the officers and soldiers of the National Army's 82nd Division are valiant warriors from Hezhou. They are all trained and guided by Deputy Director Ma Bufang. Every time they win a battle, they often say: "We feel that we are worthy of the country and the people, but we are only sorry for the Deputy Director, because we have not yet fully utilized the skills and training that the Deputy Director has given us." From this, we can know how bright and promising the future of the National Army's 82nd Division is, and how immortal Deputy Director Ma's achievement in training soldiers is.

Looking at the entire war situation in Eastern Longdong, I feel that all the measures taken in this area make us feel at ease, because there is an iron-clad force of stability here. It has restored the broken hearts of the people, boosted the morale of the demoralized, and re-ignited our national spirit and fighting spirit. However, the spiritual component of this stabilizing force accounts for the major part. As for the material equipment, it is very poor. We dare to sincerely hope and earnestly appeal that the authorities in charge quickly enrich and strengthen the material foundation of this stabilizing force, such as combat equipment. This will surely be of great benefit to the work of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country. This is the hope of the people of Eastern Longdong, and it is also the only measure to stabilize the overall situation in the west and quell the internal rebellion. We hope that the central government will pay serious attention to this and take action.

Now, the National Army's 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade are still calmly stationed in Eastern Longdong. The cooperation between the army and the people prevents the communist bandits from daring to cross the Lei Pond. We are even more confident that the 82nd Division and the 8th Cavalry Brigade will continue to progress and achieve great victories in the future.

### Record of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway

— Wuzhou 18th by Airmail, by Our Reporter Liang Xiaozhong

A withered artery, after a series of connections, has returned from death to vigorous growth. Although it will still take a more arduous time to complete the entire line, it will surely grow more vigorously. The completion of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, which is expected to start from Zhanjiang in the east, reach Guiyang in the north, and connect to Liuzhou to reach Hengyang, joining the Yue-Han Railway to facilitate the development of rich resources in the southwest, is already within reach. The Zhanjiang line, from Laibin in southern Guangxi through Guixian and Wanglin to Guangzhou Bay (Zhanjiang), has already established two engineering offices to actively carry out surveying. The total length is 390 kilometers (300 kilometers in Guangxi), and it will be completed within two years (because a part of the roadbed was built at the beginning of the war of resistance, and the terrain along the way is flat, so it is not difficult to complete it in one go). Moreover, I heard that the transportation authorities are actively engaged in port development in Guangzhou Bay, with the intention of making Zhanjiang City a gateway port for the southwest. If the project is successful, the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which has been operated by a country without a setting sun, will pale in comparison. We can wait and see.

The last and most difficult project of the entire line is the 150 kilometers from Duyun in Guizhou to Guiyang. The mountains rise and fall, and there are cliffs and precipices, most of which are narrow and dangerous paths. Some tunnel excavations are as long as 1,000 meters, and the total length of the tunnels in the entire section is 6 kilometers, with a total of 37. The originally planned Dongshanping Tunnel passing through the side of Yunwu Mountain needs to be excavated for two and a half kilometers before it can pass through. The vast amount of money required is unimaginable, so it is necessary to change the route to another road, passing through Gaojiaqiao along the highway to Guiding. Although the road is 7 kilometers longer, it saves nearly 1,000 meters of tunnel construction. As for bridge construction, it cannot be successful in a short period of time. In the more than 100 kilometers of road section, there are as many as 25 large bridges and 125 small bridges, with a total length of more than 2,000 meters. The Guiding Bridge alone is 180 meters long, and the bridge pillars are as high as 45 meters. The water flow is turbulent, the foundation is difficult to lay, and the cost is high. However, the transportation authorities also pay special attention to this section of the road, and specially allocated 8.4 billion yuan for construction. Since construction began in early October last year, it has now reached September. The earthwork project has been completed. In the future, after the road is opened to traffic, Guiyang will become the center of the southwest railway network (Yun-Qian Road, Chuan-Qian Road, Xiang-Gui-Qian Road). Going north to the frontier and south to the sea, and going back to Beijing and Shanghai, can be achieved in the near future. Its importance can be imagined.

The Xiang-Gui-Qian Road runs across four provinces, starting from Hengyang in the north, reaching Duyun in the west, passing through Guilin and Liuzhou in the middle, and branching to Zhanjiang. The total length is more than 1,000 kilometers. If it is successfully built in two years, it is already expected that the long-barren southwest will change its old appearance. The barren mountains of Guizhou and Guangxi are rich in reserves necessary for the development of heavy industry. From Guangxi's gold, silver, lead, steel, tungsten, tin, iron, and sulfur to Guizhou's coal, iron, copper, mercury, oil, antimony, and lead, as well as the deep wood and special products of the two provinces (such as Guangxi's fennel and Guizhou's mercury), can be transferred to the southeast industrial area in an instant, and the benefits of coastal fishing and salt can be distributed to the mountainous countries in the southwest, so that the people of Guizhou will no longer have to scrape the ground to survive. On the one hand, it facilitates the flow of goods, and on the other hand, it has a deeper meaning in promoting the development of southwest culture. Furthermore, in the event of trouble in the southern border, military resources can be quickly mobilized. The road bears the heavy responsibilities of economy, culture, and national defense. Its importance can be imagined. Especially if the railway plan of the Ministry of Communications is completed in the future (the original plan was: (1) to repair the existing railways in the northeast, southeast, and central plains, (2) to build new railways in the southwest and northwest provinces), with Guiyang as the center, there will be as many as five railways running across the southwest provinces. Once the entire line is open, the veins will run smoothly, and the blood circulation will be unblocked. It is truly full of vitality and prosperity is expected. We cannot help but pay our highest respects to the millions of nameless heroes who are buried in the road!

### Industrial alcohol disguised as local alcohol

[Reader Opinion] Recently, a large number of industrial alcohol disguised as local alcohol has been discovered on the market. If this continues, it will not only harm national tax revenue, hinder the business of brewers, and harm the health of consumers, but it is also very important. I would like to ask your newspaper to disclose this matter, hoping that the governing authorities will strictly crack down on it. I also hope that all firms in the industry will pay attention to this matter.

### New Trends in Modern Democratic Constitutionalism

— Critical Remarks

Author: Yang Youjiong

Publisher: Commercial Press

First Edition: August, Year Thirty-Five

Total Pages: 108

The author, Mr. Yang Youjiong, is a Chinese political theorist and constitutional scholar who has made significant contributions to the promotion of people's livelihood and constitutionalism in China. He has served as a professor of political science at various universities and has authored books such as "A History of the Founding of the Soviet Union" and "Principles of National Construction." "New Trends in Modern Democratic Constitutionalism" describes the recent trends in democratic constitutionalism in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and continental Europe, serving as a reference for China's implementation of constitutionalism. On the eve of the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, all Chinese people should have a clear understanding of the current state of democratic constitutionalism in the world as a point of reference. It must be understood that the implementation of democratic constitutionalism is not a simple matter; this arduous task requires continuous learning, and learning from practice. It cannot be achieved through empty talk, and it is certainly not a deceptive facade.

The book begins by describing the general trend of the evolution of modern democratic politics. He says that the present world is a new era of democracy, and the political tide is the most turbulent and magnificent. The idea of democratic politics has successfully become the highest principle of national construction followed by countries since the 19th century. However, the biggest obstacle to the democratic political movement in the past was the unequal distribution of wealth, which led to a situation of conflict between the rich and the poor. After this war, countries around the world should have a good opportunity to establish a fair and reasonable democratic society. The most important task for democratic countries in the future should be to strive for the balanced distribution of property rights so that everyone's life becomes more stable. A prominent phenomenon in the history of democratic politics in recent decades is the gradual evolution from narrow electoral bases, indirect elections, and unequal suffrage to universal suffrage, direct and equal universal suffrage. Only then can the true stage of democratic politics be reached.

In the second chapter, the author discusses the characteristics and essence of British constitutionalism. The United Kingdom is the homeland of the constitutional system, and the British constitution is a model for the constitutionalism of various countries. However, the British constitution is not a written document but refers to the entire structure including the complete and orderly current political system. Reforms in the British constitution do not have to wait for a revolution to occur before they can be implemented, but are the product of a long historical development. Therefore, the author says: "When we discuss the British constitution, we should not necessarily limit ourselves to specific systems in a certain period, but should include the organization and system of the entire people's life as the object."

The British constitution includes five important factors: (1) Several documents with regulatory properties in history, such as the "Magna Carta," "Petition of Right," "Bill of Rights," etc.; (2) All laws enacted in Parliament, such as determining the power of the king, protecting the rights of the people, and promoting suffrage; (3) All court judgments; (4) The principles and provisions of "common law," most of which are about the duties, powers, methods of execution of the government, and the relationship between various agencies, etc.; (5) Conventions.

The third chapter explains the trends and current forces of American constitutionalism. The characteristics of the American constitution: First, most of it includes documents granting power and prohibiting power; second, the scope of individual freedom it plans is placed under the supervision of the judicial organs to prevent it from being violated by the government. The basic principles of people's constitutionalism established in the American constitution: First, recognize the sovereignty of the people, and the establishment of the government should be based on the principle of conforming to public opinion; second, the power enjoyed by the federal government is limited to that granted in the constitution.

The American constitutional system is based on the two-party system for its operation. The purpose of a political party is to gain power, and the only way to gain power is to get the votes of the majority of the people in the election. The new development of American political theory is not only to seek political freedom and equality before the law, but also to expect the world to be built on the four basic freedoms of mankind. These four freedoms are: (1) freedom of speech, (2) freedom of belief, (3) freedom from fear, (4) freedom from want. Its ideal is to establish a system of social security through international economic cooperation.

The fourth chapter discusses the evolution and characteristics of the Soviet constitution. The characteristics of the Soviet constitution: First, the theory on which its political system is based, that is, the highest principle in law and politics, is to take the dictatorship of the proletariat as the group of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet as the political system of the Soviet Union; second, it is an extremely flexible constitution, which can be amended by the usual legislative procedures. The new Soviet constitution is moving towards democracy. At the Seventh Soviet Congress in 1935, two principles were decided to amend the constitution: (1) to make the electoral system more democratic, to replace the incompletely equal elections with equal elections, to replace the multi-level elections with direct elections, and to replace the open elections with secret elections; (2) To determine the socio-economic basis of the constitution, so that the constitution is suitable for the mutual relationship of the forces of the Soviet stage. The new constitution first stipulates that the Soviet Union is a socialist country of workers and peasants: its political foundation is the Soviet of Workers' Representatives, and all political power belongs to the workers represented by the Soviet; its economic foundation is the socialist public ownership of the means of production and the socialist organization of the national economy, and private ownership is determined by the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work."

Finally, the author briefly describes the evolution of French democratic constitutionalism and the collapse of German democratic politics, and then analyzes the constitutional trends of various countries in the First World War and the new trends in democratic constitutionalism in the future to make the democratic system more perfect and make the people of the world have a stable and happy life.

I only intend to raise two opinions about this book. First, although the author separately criticizes the gains and losses of constitutionalism in various countries, he fails to make a comprehensive review of the overall trend of democratic constitutionalism in the world in the future and point out a general route. Second, regarding the principles and implementation of Chinese democratic constitutionalism, the author has not mentioned it at all, and we feel that he should give a brief direction. Although he has already stated it in other works, we believe that the fact that this point has not been actually touched upon in this book is a defect.

### Maurois' Biography of Dickens

— Xiang Xiu

More than twenty years ago, when we in the literary world were still very unfamiliar with literary giants such as Shakespeare, Goethe, and even Balzac and Tolstoy, Dickens was already very familiar to us. Our readers, relying on Lin Qinnan's translation who did not understand English, read novels such as "The Old Curiosity Shop," "The Story of Little Nell," "The Personal History of David Copperfield," and "A Tale of Two Cities" with curiosity and excitement, and were amazed by the rich and humorous life of the British people, while being subjected to various mental tortures by this passionate author and infected by his humanitarianism. However, at that time, there were very few who could truly understand the founder of British 19th-century realism, because no one had introduced the texts to understand Dickens's life. After this long period of time, today we have the opportunity to read Xu Tianhong's translations of masterpieces such as "David Copperfield" and "A Tale of Two Cities." At the same time, we also read Maurois's "Biography of Dickens." This biography is as brilliant as Dickens's works. The author is a famous contemporary French novelist. His painting "French Tragedy" was once popular in our reading circles. His "Biography of Shelley" was also well-known.

Biography is also a kind of great creation. The author must first deeply understand the character's life, environment, thoughts, historical background, and historical trends. Only after being familiar with his social environment, and then grasping the root of his personality development and the path of his creation, and assessing the impact of his works on the contemporary and future generations, can he make appropriate judgments. This kind of biography is not only a dry historical record, but also the author's arduous artistic creation.

A beautiful biography of a character is itself a complete work of art. This contains the crystallization of the creation of two artists' minds. We have been deeply inspired by this when reading several biographies of heroes by Romain Rolland.

Dickens grew up in the early 19th century in England, when England was transforming from an agricultural society to an industrial society. He saw that the countryside was declining, urban material civilization was expanding, and the distance between the poor and the rich was getting farther and farther, forming an abnormal state of society. He himself was born in poverty, so his works always express sympathy for the poor and a deep satire and attack on contemporary society. But because he is a warm-hearted humanitarian, the way he takes criticism is a kind of sincere, passive naturalism. He advocates that the debtors' prison must be abolished, the poor people's training institute must be abolished, and the bad schools must be abolished, but what should be used to replace them? How to solve the poverty of the people, Dickens does not know. In this respect, he is quite similar to Tolstoy. Dickens uses his "tears" and "laughter" to accuse mankind. The angry laughter of the satirist, and the tears of anger for social injustice, are full in most of his works. On the other hand, Dickens is the founder of British realism in literary history. When the first third of the 19th century was the period when romanticism prevailed, Dickens's "The Pickwick Papers" surprised the romanticists at that time.

After Maurois analyzed Dickens's artistic life in detail, he also made a very interesting comparison of the characteristics of writers in various European countries. He said:

"Dickens provides us with an excellent opportunity to study this effect, which is a sense of humor. Imagine, if a group of writers of unknown nationality encountered a serious social crime, the cause of a disaster, or an absurd thing, what would happen? The Russians will sympathize with this absurd thing, describe it as a beloved friend, and then use "pity" to wipe it away. The Germans will build a hazy, metaphysical wall around it, and then use a poetic, romantic method to turn it into a goblin or a devil; after that, he will feel at ease inventing a very sophisticated machine to cut the devil into many small pieces. If an American is over thirty, he will say that there are no monsters in the world; if he is under thirty, he will say that there are tens of thousands of monsters. The French will preach to the monster and use it to say many jokes. The British will describe this thing in great detail and accuracy, explaining the size of its various organs, imitating its language and even its detailed expressions. At this time, the reader (or audience) will feel that the British writer is really enjoying describing terrible things or oppressible things. Then, suddenly there appeared a slightly distorted line or an obviously exaggerated word, which made people understand that there was a hidden smile in that solemn attitude. The entire terrifying anatomy, the anatomy that was so painstakingly created, will collapse in an instant—in a smile—and more importantly, it will remove the real monster for us."

What a profound and clever observation and comparison. In "Dickens Biography," Maurois expounded many extremely valuable insights. Before there is a better biography of Dickens, this is indeed an important reference book when reading Dickens's novels.

### Literary Handbook

— Wang Huaide

(Author: Ai Wu, Publisher: Cultural Supply Agency)

There are many books on literary lectures that can be bought in the market, but they are either too difficult, making it difficult for learners without foundation to understand, or the materials are too poor, and there is no complete description of the theoretical system of literature. If you want to find a book that beginners can understand and are interested in reading, and can benefit a lot after reading it, it is as difficult as sifting gold from sand. Of course, the literary handbook is not perfect, but in my opinion, it is relatively satisfactory.

The author Ai Wu is the writer who is most able to use the most common and vulgar words to write novels, and his skill is clearly reflected in this book. Therefore, I think the literary handbook itself is a very worthy book. However, the theories in it are not just inherited from other people's old tunes. He himself has a lot of new insights that permeate it, and these insights are often thought-provoking and worthy of our careful study, and we still need to continue to explore them.

The whole book is divided into three parts: the first discusses the essence of literature; the second discusses the tools and materials of literature; and the last dissects the actual creation.

The first part includes the least amount of text, only accounting for one-sixth of the entire book. It discusses the attitude of young people towards learning literature, the function of literature, the occurrence and development of literature, and other issues. In particular, the section "Who Literature Serves" says that "literature always serves the majority of people's happiness, speaks for the majority of people, defends the majority of people, and encourages the majority of people to fight for justice..." Compared with the saying that literature is "truth, goodness, and beauty," it is much more straightforward and delightful. For example, "What is the main function of literature?" The author believes that the first is that it can drive away our selfishness, make us have close concern for strangers, and arouse deep sympathy; the second is that it can drive away inherited concepts, and make us have a correct understanding of true life; and the last is that it can arm us, so that we do not compromise with evil forces. This view, after the author's examples, makes people feel the same. Every time he talks about the difficulties of learning literature, the author always earnestly persuades young people to work hard to overcome them, and the feeling of intimacy is obvious on the paper.

The second part discusses "How We Should Collect Words," and has incisive arguments; from various propositions, we know that the author has put some effort into this aspect. For example, "How We Should Record the Language of the People" is also written quite well. There is also "The Characteristics of the Oral Language of the People," and the author believes that "the prefix is rich," and gives many examples, such as "...very sour, called "slippery sour", very sweet, called "honey sweet", very spicy, called "flying spicy", very painful, called "essence pain", very poisonous, called "widow poison", very far, called "old far"..." Once pointed out, it is felt that we rarely use it in our articles, which is a pity. "Rich in concrete image," such as "If you don't succeed in talking to someone, you will be scolded a few words, called "bump your nose with ashes". Originally, it was said that "it is difficult to protect oneself"...but you still have to add "clay bodhisattva crossing the river" to describe it." These are concrete examples that people can easily understand. "Rich in connotation," such as... the person who buys beef said: "Hey, did you soak water in this beef?" The person who sells beef said: "Nonsense! The best, soaked in water!" The person who buys beef answered: "It's the best! There are benches in the provincial government for you to sit on." The last sentence is implicit,...if you say directly: "The government will arrest you and lock you up." That would provoke the other party to be ashamed and angry, and might even resort to violence." What a funny example! Other problems are also discussed a lot, and I don't want to explain them one by one here.

The third part of "What Are the Main Conditions for Creation," "How to Write Characters in Works," "Creating Typical Characters and Individuality," "How to Write Characters' Speeches," "How to Write Background," etc., all have simple and clear explanations. But the most important thing is "What is the creative process like?", and Lu Xun's "Medicine" is used as material for analysis.

I don't intend to make a big record for the literary handbook, because that is still useless to the reader. If you are willing to carefully read this book, I think that in our minds, there must be a clear outline of literature. In fact, no matter how small the problem is, the author has the appropriate convenience to help you understand it; you remember that example, and you have a thorough understanding of the theory.

In short, the literary handbook is a simple and popular book, and it is valuable—for young literary learners.

Dickens (Charles Dickens, 1812-1870)

### Marshall's Economic Theory

— Gu Wenbin

Written by Zhu Baoyi, published by Commercial Press

In economics, there is Marshall, just like Beethoven in music, Kant in philosophy, and Newton and Einstein in physics. The economics textbooks currently used in universities, eighty or ninety percent of them are based on Marshall's economic theory, and ten or twelve percent are developed under the influence of Marshall.

Since Marshall's economic theory occupies such an important position in economics, then his achievements should be familiar and studied by everyone who studies economics. However, in fact, this is not the case. In China, few people who study economics, except for a few graduate students, have directly read Marshall's original works, and few have a clear concept of the entire system of Marshall's theory. The reason is that Marshall's original works are vast, and there is no introductory book in Chinese to introduce them to people whose theoretical cultivation is not yet in-depth.

Recently, I read the book "Marshall's Economic Theory" (compiled by Zhu Baoyi) published by the Commercial Press, which can be said to satisfy my many years of desire. This is a concise and powerful introductory book. The book is not long, only more than one hundred pages, and it gives a clear description of Marshall's complex and diverse theoretical system. There are very few direct quotations from the original text in the book, and the editor explains them in a third-person tone. In the part of introducing the theory, in addition to describing Marshall's own theory, it also introduces the origin of the theory, the contributions of scholars before Marshall, and the criticisms and revisions of scholars after Marshall, so you can see the process of the gradual change of economic theory. The editor must be someone who is willing to spend time collecting information before writing.

What is regrettable is that there are many typos in the book, and especially many errors in punctuation, and I hope the editor can correct them in the next edition!

In today's world where the flames of war are raging and prices are fluctuating, I am afraid that there are still many people who are willing to read some meaningful books in the summer. I would like to recommend this small book to students who love economics.

### Reading "Rudin"

— Shu Zhang

"Rudin" is the first novel in Turgenev's series of six interconnected novels, a foundational introduction to the subsequent works. They are used by the author to express the intellectual currents of an era and to report on the social dynamics of the time. Particularly, the author's clumsy yet elegant romantic style and his cultivation in various arts have attracted many readers, enchanted countless young people, and established his position in the literary world.

From "Rudin," we can see the social conditions of that time and even find the sprouts of nascent social and political movements. The darkness of the era in which the protagonist lived was no less than today's, perhaps even more so. At that time, the notorious tyrant Nicholas I was in power, cruel and authoritarian. Advanced young intellectuals naturally gathered together to form a group, and Rudin was one of them. This kind of group was a real and deeply meaningful historical fact. They praised truth, art, and the god of morality.

However, these people, living in philosophical contemplation and abstract ideals, were completely unsuitable when it came to actually doing things. Empty talkers are ultimately of no help. Like rootless duckweed, they are forever destined to drift and have a miserable fate. No wonder the author arranged an inglorious ending for the protagonist in the book.

"Rudin" is a book that expresses this theme. Its structure is exceptionally simple, and the content is roughly as follows:

Dmitri Rudin is a thirty-five-year-old Russian landowner, not wealthy. Through the relationship with his friend, the Lefnef Baron, he gets acquainted with a noblewoman, Darya Mikhailovna. On the evening of that visit, at Darya's house after dinner, Rudin displays his eloquent talent, defeating Pigasov, Darya's neighbor, a skeptic who despises truth and culture, who has always been unrivaled in his outspokenness. He wins the sincere admiration and respect of everyone present, the hostess and the neighbors. His endless flow of words, his invincible eloquence, his rich thoughts, and his fiery passion make the hostess feel that she had met him too late, and she sincerely invites him to stay at her country villa.

In the morning, he goes to the hostess's room for tea. During the conversation, a local landowner, Lezhnyov, visits the hostess to discuss the issue of their boundary lines. He is Rudin's former classmate from university, and they had a close friendship, but later separated due to repeated misunderstandings. This meeting still involves a slight debate.

Rudin comes out of the room and encounters the hostess's daughter in the corridor, the seventeen-year-old beautiful Natalya, a pragmatic, passionate girl with a heroic spirit, and her teacher, Miss Pengof, accompanying them for a walk in the garden. The hearts of the two young people both sprout the seeds of love, which causes the unusual jealousy of her usual admirer, Volyntsev.

His heart is heavy, and he slips away from dinner, returning to his widowed sister Alexandra's room. Lezhnyov is sitting with her—they had also loved each other for a long time and later got married—and Lezhnyov is talking about Rudin's family background and his youth, disapproving of his behavior and criticizing his high-flown talk of lofty purity.

One morning two months later, Natalya meets Rudin again in the garden. He hints at his love for her, as agreed, bewildering her. She even runs past Volyntsev without noticing. At the breakfast table, Volyntsev, under the guise of a pretext, sharply satirizes Rudin, causing an uproar, but Rudin actually tolerates it and does not retort.

After the meal, Rudin secretly arranges to meet Natalya in the garden in the evening. This time, he nakedly pours out his accumulated love, and the flames of passion ignite her heart. She bravely replies that she loves him too, and they part hurriedly. Rudin congratulates himself on his happiness, but misfortune immediately befalls him.

Poddalevsky, the hostess's secretary, a flattering little man, peeps at this scene from the bushes and secretly informs the hostess. From then on, the situation changes. Rudin is no longer treated as a welcome guest, but is met with coldness, and Natalya is difficult to meet. That evening, he receives her secret letter asking him to make their final farewell by the Afdu Pond the next morning.

That day, Natalya tells Rudin that her mother firmly opposes their love and wants her to break up with him. When she asks him what countermeasures he has, he timidly says, "Only to obey fate." Therefore, she bitterly denounces his empty talk of independence and sacrifice, saying that he is just a coward who only stirs up love affairs because he is bored. Sadly, she turns around and runs away without hesitation.

Rudin returns in frustration. He writes farewell letters, one to Volyntsev and one to Natalya. That evening, he bids farewell to the hostess and sets off to return to his own estate.

Two years later, news comes that Volyntsev and Natalya are engaged in Moscow. Several years pass. In the first-class hotel in the town of Tebuff, Lezhnyov unexpectedly meets Rudin, who is down on his luck. They restore their old friendship. During dinner, Rudin tells of his wandering life since their separation and the failures of his various undertakings. Time has passed, and he has achieved nothing. He is no longer the eloquent orator he once was. Exhausted and distressed, he admits that he can only talk emptily and will inevitably fail and have a bad ending. Then they part.

Yes, he did not have a good ending. In the July 1848 battle of the Paris Revolution, the Red Republicans were almost completely wiped out. The last one to die was a Polish party member, and this Polish party member was Dmitri Rudin.

The protagonist Rudin is a typical figure of that era, representing the many young people at that time who were full of hot blood and eagerly sought truth and reform. He is a hero of the era and also its victim. He is a braggart without shame, truly a giant when it comes to speaking, but a dwarf when it comes to doing things. He is as eloquent as Demosthenes, but as soon as he joins a difficult test, he immediately loses face and fails.

Is this not exactly the same as the young people we can encounter more than once in the era we are in now? But, please note, Rudin represents 1840, a century ago. How have people progressed since then—which can be found in the protagonist Lavretsky in the second novel "A Nest of Gentlefolk"—to the achievements of a country like today? And what about us? How will we compare and distinguish ourselves?

Dear readers, here, I sincerely introduce this book, "Rudin."

Shanghai Jottings

### Cliques and Others

— Shi Lang

Although Shanghai is chaotic and complex, careful scrutiny reveals that it is orderly. For example, those who push wheelbarrows on the bridge have a specific area, a specific time, and a specific boss; they cannot mess around. Similarly, pickpockets, beggars, and stallholders all have their own remembered cliques and bosses. These bosses are the masters of Shanghai's lower classes. They pay for their own heaven, their own world, their own masses. Everyone is organized and absolutely obeys and follows the rules.

If something happens in a certain area, "follow the map to find the horse"; as long as the boss pats you on the chest, it is a law, an absolutely effective promise. Therefore, if you understand Shanghai, you will not find Shanghai so mysterious or so chaotic.

However, from the opposite perspective, they are absolutely believers in "cliquism" and "turf rights." They are also deeply rooted and unbreakable in these cliques. You absolutely cannot change the outdated rules they have set. No one dares to encroach on their designated areas.

This is a cross-section of life in Shanghai and also a microcosm of Chinese society.

A friend came from XX and talked to me at length about the floating and sinking of officialdom. He felt very pained by the personnel disputes and the atmosphere of exclusion and infighting in the official arena. He said, "You only see 'cliques.' Each clique desperately tries to promote people within its own clique and excludes people from outside the clique from getting involved. So you have one system, and he has another system. They attack each other and hate each other. This situation is really heartbreaking."

In fact, my friend is a bit of an alarmist. Which place doesn't emphasize systems? Which corner isn't a clique? Look, if you want to push a wheelbarrow onto the bridge, and you are not under the command of this "boss," don't even think about getting five hundred yuan for the tunnel.

Free Talk

Biographies

### Impression of Zuo Shunsheng

— Ping Zhai

I often feel that a major characteristic of the China Youth Party is that it does not indulge in empty talk but seeks truth from facts—and, after a policy has been decided, it never looks left and right or hesitates to move forward. The people of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party are not lacking in talent. When they hold meetings, they are eloquent, but it is difficult to reach a conclusion that is both initially and practically sound. As a result, they argue endlessly and remain deadlocked, and each tends toward extremes, eventually leading to a split. In comparison, the China Youth Party is truly much more "mature."

I think that the China Youth Party's ability to cultivate this spirit of facing reality should be attributed to good leadership. Last summer, when the major events of convening the National Assembly, drafting the Constitution, and expanding the foundation of the government were still being discussed, I separately interviewed several key figures from the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party under the scorching sun. Their opinions have already been published in the newspapers and, in today's view, have become relics of the past. However, one impression remains very vivid: the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party had many theories, grand and without substance; the China Youth Party immediately provided many concrete questions that were completely practical, and the one who spoke most frankly and had the clearest attitude was the current Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng.

Mr. Zuo is very talkative and humorous. At that time, because he was not feeling well, he looked somewhat unkempt, with the demeanor of a celebrity. Indeed, the entrance of the China Youth Party headquarters on Haig Road was heavily guarded, and the guards were arrogant, making people hesitant to ask for instructions. However, the living room of Zuo's residence on Difeng Road was often filled with laughter and conversation, without any restraint—because the host often said, "This is just us talking among ourselves; there's no need to publish it in the newspapers." And the guests also respected the host's opinion.

Once, unintentionally, the topic turned to the proposal made by some people at that time to immediately and unconditionally cease fire. Mr. Zuo leaned back in the sofa and laughed, "Originally, when you win a lot at mahjong, you stand up and want to leave, not allowing others to continue playing—but will others who have lost money be willing not to try to win it back?"

In fact, the prelude to the war had not yet begun at that time. But Mr. Zuo affirmed very firmly and seriously, "Shandong and Shanxi are acute illnesses, and acute illnesses are easy to cure; the Northeast and Northwest, however, are chronic illnesses, and chronic illnesses must be treated carefully."

Mr. Zuo has finally taken office as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, but the talk of him heading the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has been around for a long time. When the authorities had just expressed their determination to expand the foundation of the government, the atmosphere of Mr. Zuo taking office immediately became strong again. So I went to visit him again, and he smiled with a frown, "It's the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry again! I don't know why, but there was this rumor in Chongqing, saying that I was going to take on the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and a reporter mentioned this in the newspaper. Oh, it really hurt me! So many letters of recommendation came!" He gestured with his hand, and the height of the pile of letters was probably between two and three feet.

However, the "rumor" ultimately became a reality. He once explained his difficulties frankly, "We participate in the government as a party, which is different from the situation of social dignitaries like Mr. Wang Yunwu participating in the government as individuals. We cannot but have many considerations. For example, we cannot disappoint the expectations of our comrades within the party. Moreover, after joining, will we be able to act freely? There are many, many difficulties. It is also not good for comrades to be concentrated in central agencies. We are competing as a political party, so we must make preparations in local governments as well."

Finally, in the newspapers these past few days, we have read the news that local governments are about to be reorganized in part.

The China Youth Party seems to be adopting a strategy of "advancing step by step and consolidating each position." Is Mr. Zuo's taking office and Li Youhuang's firm resignation as Minister of Economic Affairs two sides of the same strategy?

### Tuition Fees

— Xu Jijing

Although it is still summer vacation, the tuition fee issue for the next semester has already become a concern for all parties. The education authorities have only a pitifully small amount of education funding to maintain a not-so-small education undertaking, which is indeed quite painstaking. In fact, to ensure that schools can survive well, collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees from students is a viable solution. However, in order to take into account the decline of the social economy and the burdens on student families, they have to restrict the fees charged by schools.

The Ministry of Education has set a standard for tuition and miscellaneous fees for public schools in the next semester (see this newspaper on the 14th). In terms of middle schools, a boarding high school student only needs to pay 87,000 yuan, which seems quite small in the current situation of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan per picul of rice. However, the problem for school administrators arises again, because the funds given by the government to public schools and the teachers' salaries are issued according to civil service standards. As everyone knows, civil servants' salaries are far from meeting their living needs. However, the salaries of teachers in general private schools are better, because their source of income is student fees. Therefore, in the general situation of the last semester, private school teachers' salaries were higher than those of public schools, which is a blow to public schools, because the reason why many public schools have their current status and achievements is mainly due to their possession of a group of excellent teachers. If this situation of unequal treatment continues, these teachers with more experience and knowledge will be in danger of slipping into private schools. To save this crisis, public schools then levy a "Respect-the-Teacher Fund," which, although should be a voluntary donation in nature, is in fact a mandatory levy, that is, a disguised tuition fee. The amount of the "Respect-the-Teacher Fund" in Jiangsu provincial schools, as far as I know, is one picul of rice. This money, as the name suggests, is of course used to increase teachers' salaries. However, according to statistical results, the ratio of teachers' salaries in public and private middle schools along the Beijing-Shanghai line in the last semester was 2:3, which means that private school teachers' income was one-half more than that of provincial schools. Now that the Ministry of Education stipulates that the "Respect-the-Teacher Fund" is not allowed to be collected next semester, I don't know how many public schools, especially several famous provincial schools, will solve this difficult problem.

The fees charged by private schools have already been eliminated hard restrictions in Shanghai, and it seems that all regions will follow suit. However, in this period of drastic price fluctuations, private schools are still hesitant to decide on the fee amount for the next semester. But according to the situation, this will be a very alarming amount. The main source of income for private schools is fees. In the current stage of high prices, it is impossible to unilaterally prevent tuition fees from rising. However, I hope that these fees can be collected reasonably and used reasonably. The so-called "collected reasonably" means that the amount should be reduced to the lowest possible limit. The so-called "used reasonably" means that the income should be used entirely for teachers' salaries and the maintenance of the school, that is, absolutely achieving "taken from students, used for students," and not for the benefit of a few private individuals. Only in this way will students and parents be willing to grit their teeth and accept it.

(Editor's note: We hope that relevant parties can specifically list the facts and propose discussions on this issue.)

### Miscellany of Travels in America

— Xu Shuyuan

In the movie theater

We might as well make a dogmatic definition: the more movie theaters there are in a place, the more developed the public education is, because movies have an educational function, and watching movies is easier to understand than reading dead books. The American education authorities have already integrated education and movies. Taking military education as an example, almost every hour of lectures is followed by a movie. Future education will use sight instead of mouth. Teachers can seal their mouths and still receive the effects of education. American movie theaters have almost become licorice root in medicine. Any small city or town has at least two movie theaters. Their movie theaters are small. Except for a few large cities, it is difficult to find a movie theater as grand as the Grand Theater. American movie theaters are the jewels under the chain system. Each movie trust owns one or two thousand movie theaters, so you can see Paramount Theatre, Fox Theatre, and Roxy Theatre everywhere. Movies start at 2 pm and continue until 11 pm. If you don't have air conditioning at home, you can buy a ticket and sit from 2 pm to 11 pm, and no one will kick you out. But Americans have a habit. Except for particularly good movies, they don't want to watch a second showing because it is not easy to arouse curiosity when watching a second showing. If you are not careful, all the impressions of the first showing will be ruined. You have to queue to buy tickets. Since there are no showings, people buying tickets do not stop. The long snake formation has always existed. The box office is along the street, and the ticket-buying queue is lined up on the sidewalk. If a good movie is showing, the queue starts from the box office and turns and winds all the way to the second street, even circling a few times, which is quite a spectacle. There is a small shop next to the box office, specializing in selling ice cream, fried rice, and candy. Each bag of fried rice costs two cents. American women especially like to eat it. It is bland and tasteless, and it is crisper than old cotton, making a soft sound. As soon as an American young lady enters the theater, she lies on the chair with her legs resting on the back of the seat in front, and she eats fake fried rice. They echo each other, which is a bit noisy, but there is one advantage: they no longer talk when they eat fried rice; otherwise, the order would be even more chaotic. People who are accustomed to living in Shanghai and have adopted the style of English gentlemen do not talk in movie theaters and wear swallowtail coats to banquets. Americans don't have that. As long as you don't yell in the movie theater, no one will interfere with you, but don't forget to take off your hat, otherwise someone in the back seat will yell Take it off or knock your headgear off with a coin. In American movie theaters, no one will interfere with you if you hook your arms around your female companion or have more exciting performances, because people watching movies have no reason to be distracted to watch performances other than movies.

### The Life of Zhang Jiao

— Zhou Leng

Miscellaneous Essays on Wei and Jin Dynasty Figures, Part Four

If Yu Ji was the theorist of the peasant movement at that time, then undoubtedly Zhang Jiao was the leader of this movement. Regarding Zhang Jiao's life deeds, there is a good report in the Biography of Huangfu Song in the Book of the Later Han:

"Initially, Zhang Jiao of Julu, calling himself the Great Virtuous Teacher, served the Yellow God's Way, and the people believed in him. Jiao sent his disciples in all directions to deceive people, and in more than ten years, he had hundreds of thousands of followers. Connecting counties and states, the people of Qing, Xu, You, Ji, Jing, Yang, Yan, and Yu eight states all responded. Zhang falsely claimed that the Azure Heaven was dead and the Yellow Heaven should be established, and he wrote in white soil on the gates of the capital city temples and the state and county government offices, and he also agreed with the Zhongchang attendant Feng Xu and Xu Feng to be his internal supporters. They agreed to rise up both inside and outside on the fifth day of the third month, but before they could rebel, the matter was exposed... When Jiao and others knew that the matter had been revealed, they sped to all sides day and night, rising up at the same time, all using yellow turbans as their sign. Within ten days, the world responded, and the capital was shaken."

Although this is a brief report, Zhang Jiao's character can already be seen from it. From his secret deployment to plan the uprising to his sudden action when the case was exposed, this skill and this courage could never have been done by a "demon thief" as most people think.

So, what was Zhang Jiao's political purpose? The best explanation is that they used the yellow market as a symbol. According to the Fifth Volume of the Book of Jin and the Record of Clothing, "The turban is made of kudzu vine, shaped like a Tao, and worn horizontally. It was the common clothing of the noble and the lowly in ancient times." In other words, isn't it very clearly expressed that they are breaking the concept of class and advocating human equality? Moreover, the Biography of Zhang Lu in the Shu Wei Book of the Records of the Three Kingdoms also states: "Zhang Lu occupied Hanzhong and taught the people with ghost ways, all teaching them to be honest and not to cheat. Those who were sick confessed their faults, which was mostly similar to the Yellow Turbans. He also set up 'righteous houses' and hung rice and meat in the righteous houses, allowing travelers to take as much as they needed, and if they took too much, ghost soldiers would punish them with disease." Thus, although their actions were heavily religious in color, aren't these actions denying private ownership and advocating common consumption?

Of course, these measures are not surprising today, but thousands of years ago, Zhang Jiao dared to make such a bold attempt in a society under the strict rule of landlords. Doesn't this idea and this action deserve our surprise? Accordingly, when Zhang Jiao's power spread, the representatives of the ruling forces, such as Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Yuan Shao, forgot their mutual opposition and concentrated their efforts to actively suppress them, and even after Zhang Jiao died, they had to dissect his coffin and mutilate his corpse. This can just explain who Zhang Jiao was after all, and explain that the contradiction of class is really above all reason.

### Bada Shanren

— Ji Ming

The porcelain bowls and dishes sold in the market often bear the inscription "Bada Shanren." I once suspected its origin. After reading the biography of Bada Shanren, I suddenly realized it. It turns out that porcelain mostly comes from Jingde, and Jingde is close to Nanchang, which is the former residence of Shanren. According to Shanren, he was a descendant of the Ming Dynasty imperial family, and his name is lost. When he was young, he encountered the national upheaval and abandoned his family to become a monk, living in the mountains for more than twenty years. His followers once numbered in the hundreds. Later, he was hired by Magistrate Hu of Linchuan. After more than a year, he suddenly suffered from madness, tore his monk's robe, and burned it, pretending to be in the market, and no one could recognize him. His nephew took him to his home, and after a long time, he recovered.

Shanren was skilled in calligraphy and painting and also liked to drink alcohol, but he could not finish two liters. He would often go when poor scholars or butchers in the market invited him to drink. After going, he would often get drunk. After getting drunk, he would splash ink everywhere, not caring much about it. However, he could not be obtained by nobles who sought it with heavy gold. One day, he suddenly wrote the word "dumb" on the door and never spoke a word again. Shao Qingmen (Changheng) was a guest in Nanchang and saw Shanren at the Beilan Temple. They cut candles and talked at night, and they used brushes to write on the table to communicate with each other. His state of first being mad and then dumb was like this.

Shanren's first name as a monk was Xuetong, and he later changed his name to Renwu and Lvhan. He finally ended with the name Bada Shanren. Those who know Shanren today only know him as a calligrapher and painter, but they do not know that Shanren, living in the aftermath of a fallen country and continuing the chaos of mourning, suppressed his weeping, which was no less than that of Xie Die and Zheng Suonan. Alas.

Scientific Essays

### Aerial Dock (Part 2)

— Gu Junzheng

In short, if we consider the aerial dock as the starting point for space ships, all conditions are nearly ideal. Starting with an initial velocity of five miles per second, without air resistance, in fact, adding only another one and a half to two miles per second would be enough to escape Earth and head towards the Moon.

The proponent of this aerial dock is Von Pirquet. Pirquet's original intention was to create a base for exploration and travel within the solar system. Because the base itself has high speed, it can enable spaceships to gain more speed. Also, because the base is almost a vacuum, it can serve as a safe storage for liquid fuel. Those fuels, as long as they are not directly exposed to solar radiation (because radiation is enough to heat and evaporate the liquid), can be stored there for a long time, remaining unchanged.

The aerial dock also has many other characteristics, even if space travel is not undertaken, it still has its own value. Originally, the aerial dock, compared to the ground, has at least three important characteristics:

(1) This dock moves in a vacuum, and this vacuum is more complete and permanent than what can be created on the ground.

(2) It is easier to create the highest and lowest temperatures on this dock. Any object on it, if simply made of a surface covered with sodium metal flakes to reflect away the direct radiation of the sun, then its own heat will be dissipated in the form of radiation, cooling to near absolute zero within minutes, lower than the lowest temperature created in the laboratory. But on the other hand, it is easy to concentrate the sun's rays on an object there, heating it to a temperature exceeding that of an electric arc.

(3) This dock is unaffected by gravity.

Because the aerial dock has these three basic different conditions, if a researcher lives here, he can often complete experiments that cannot be completed on Earth. For example, an electronics expert can build a completely vacuum laboratory in this huge high vacuum. Physicists can study high and low temperatures, as well as solar and cosmic radiation that is not obscured by the air. Astronomers can install large telescopes here without worrying about their weight and without being hindered by the air. Whether biological and chemical phenomena are affected by gravity cannot be tested on the ground. Now, with this gravity-free aerial dock, biologists and chemists will certainly be happy to conduct planned research on this issue.

In addition, some people have proposed building three aerial docks on the same orbit, forming the three vertices of an equilateral triangle, to serve as relay stations for global radio and television. According to theoretical estimates, the cost of such relay stations would be less than building them on the ground. Others have proposed building a huge flat reflector on an aerial dock that orbits the Earth every twenty-four hours, to reflect the light of the sun, which has just set below the horizon, onto the ground to serve as nighttime lighting for large cities. If parabolic reflectors are used to concentrate sunlight and beam it to the ground, it could even change the climate of a region, create or eliminate storms, melt icebergs, and in times of war, it could even be used as an irresistible weapon against the enemy.

In short, the conditions on the aerial dock are completely new in human experience. Under new conditions, new results will be produced, which is beyond question. Therefore, if we have such a base for pure academic research, then new discoveries will inevitably emerge one after another, and perhaps one of those discoveries could repay all the expenses and more!
