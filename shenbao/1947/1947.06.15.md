[Our Correspondent, Changchun, 14th] Sun Liren changed his flight to Shenyang on the 14th at noon, and it is rumored that he may stop briefly in Shenyang before flying directly to Nanjing.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] Liao Yaoxiang arrived in Shenyang from Tieling on the evening of the 13th. He told reporters that the defenses of Tieling have been completed according to the original plan, and the Communists have not dared to attack. Liao analyzed the battle situation, saying: The Communists' siege of Siping in recent days may be a feint; they are only using a large number of scattered soldiers to attack. Their true ambition may still be Shenyang. We can assert that they will definitely not be able to cross Tieling to invade.

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] For the past two days, the focus of the Northeast war situation has been on Siping, where a large number of Communist troops have gathered and are attacking Siping with all their might. On the other hand, in the Benxi area southeast of Shenyang, the Communist forces there are small, but of great importance. The Communist forces gathered outside Siping are strong, numbering about ten thousand troops, and have been fiercely attacking various strongholds on the outskirts for the past three days. On the 13th, the air force went out, and the fighting subsided slightly, but became intense again at night, with several fires breaking out in the city after being hit by artillery.

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] The Battle of Siping has entered a tense stage. On the 14th, the Communist forces launched four fierce attacks with a massive force. The airfield was hit and caught fire. There was fierce fighting within three to five miles of the suburbs of Siping, with the airfield being the most intense.

[Our Correspondent, Changchun, 14th] The fighting in Siping has been quiet since 9 a.m. yesterday. The Communist 1st and 2nd Security Brigades attacked the airfield fiercely and were repulsed.

It is also learned that the 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions of the Communist 2nd Column are still in the area north and east of Changtu and Kaiyuan, and the rumor that they have reached the outskirts of Siping is inaccurate.

The telegram stated: "The Communist forces gathered their main force on the night of the 13th to attack Siping fiercely. From morning to night, the artillery battle did not stop. I have inspired morale and will defend Siping with the spirit of success or death, to live up to your expectations."

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] On the morning of the 13th, the Communist forces invaded Gongyuan and Benxi. The first Communist troops to enter Gongyuan and Benxi were small in number, only a few hundred in each place. A large force arrived on the morning of the 14th, and the National Army is working on a counterattack. Gongyuan and Benxi are both large industrial and mining strongholds on the periphery of Shenyang. The Benxi Railway connects to the Shenyang section of the China-Changchun Railway in the west and the Jiatun Station in the south. The Gongyuan Railway connects to Liaoyang in the west.

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 14th] After Gongyuan, a major southeastern stronghold on the periphery of Shenyang, fell, the situation in that area suddenly became tense.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 14th] Large numbers of National Army reinforcements have arrived in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway.

Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a reply from the Soviet side, and the authorities are still handling this matter with caution.

"Beitashan is the same as Changbaishan; Barbarian soldiers suddenly invade Yumen Pass"

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Zeng Qi, the leader of the China Youth Party, is still recovering from his illness in the Central Hospital. He recently expressed his feelings on the Mongolian soldiers' invasion of Xinjiang, saying that because the situation is not yet fully clear, it is temporarily inconvenient to judge. He insisted on his belief that a second national crisis will eventually come, and the people of the country must unite to save the nation from extinction, and not think that the country can be safe after the victory of the War of Resistance. The Song Dynasty did not perish at the hands of the Jin Dynasty, but at the hands of the Yuan Dynasty. History is there for our reference. Zeng recently wrote four poems on current events and history, intending to alert his compatriots, which are recorded below:

Beitashan is the same as Changbaishan; Barbarian soldiers suddenly invade Yumen Pass. Please ask Zhonghang Yue; Can any Huns return on horseback?

They even become a stepson and call the thief father; There is no shame in this world. In ancient times, there was a traitor Mao Yanshou; That's why he sent Zhao Jun to comfort the barbarians.

Building fortifications to stop the war will ultimately not work; The lobbyists in the Song Dynasty were also in vain. Relying on offense is comparable to relying on defense; A heavenly defense might be completely effective.

The Jin's invasion of the Song Dynasty is laughably foolish; The Yuan's swallowing of China is terrifyingly intelligent. They directly entered the depths of the Southwest; And Zhao's kingdom was completely pacified!

### Premier Zhang’s Economic Plan to Reform Finance, Bringing Floating Capital Back to the Right Track; Will be Submitted for Discussion at the Next Executive Yuan Meeting

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 14th] An senior official of the Executive Yuan stated that the economic reform plan drafted by Premier Zhang will be submitted for discussion at the next Executive Yuan meeting next week. It is said that this plan was drafted based on the economic plan of the Third Plenary Session, and 95% of the original plan of the senators were retained, with only a few points slightly different. The main points of the plan include: (1) Stabilizing the currency value, (2) Reforming finance, (3) Bringing floating capital back to the right track, (4) Increasing production, (5) Developing agriculture, (6) Establishing people's livelihood industries, etc.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 14th] According to semi-official sources, the Chinese government's confiscation of enemy and puppet properties totaled 94.897 billion yuan by March of this year. The enemy and puppet properties that have not yet been processed are estimated to be approximately 76.257 billion yuan.

### Stabilization of Northeastern Currency; Statement by a Financial Figure

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 14th] The currency of the Northeast is the most complicated. According to an authoritative financial figure here: (1) The amount of puppet Manchukuo currency issued before the restoration was 8.2 billion yuan, which increased to 13.6 billion yuan before and after the restoration. Some of it was taken away by Japanese prisoners, so the total amount of puppet Manchukuo currency in the Northeast is about 13 billion yuan. Almost all of the puppet Manchukuo currency in the government area has been recovered. (2) The stamped legal tender was a temporary currency used when the National Army entered the pass, amounting to about 830 million yuan, and has long been completely recovered. (3) The central government is issuing circulating notes prudently. A certain newspaper in Tianjin recently reported that "the Northeast is issuing an additional 8 billion circulating notes per month, which is truly alarming." In fact, there is absolutely no such thing. (4) According to estimates, the amount of counterfeit currency issued by the Communist side in the area under its control has reached 52 billion yuan. (5) There are still about 1 billion yen and Korean yen in the Lushun and Dalian areas. The handling method remains to be determined after the takeover. Regarding the finance of the entire Northeast, the authorities are planning to gradually auction off enemy and puppet assets, and the revenue this year may reach 20 billion yuan, which can recover a large amount of circulating notes. Therefore, there is absolutely no problem with the finance of the Northeast.

### Details of the Beitashan Battle; The Dihua Authorities Received a Report from the Front

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 14th] In the Beitashan battle, the local radio station was destroyed by invading aircraft, and communications were disrupted for several days, resulting in an unclear situation. The military authorities here were extremely anxious and sent people overnight to inquire about the situation and send additional troops to reinforce the garrison. However, due to the long distance, it took time to travel back and forth. A detailed report from the front was received this morning, which is recorded as follows: "At noon on the 5th of this month, about one battalion of Outer Mongolian cavalry, equipped with light and heavy weapons, launched a fierce attack on our Beitashan garrison under the cover of five Soviet-marked aircraft (previously mistakenly reported as four aircraft). The area was guarded by a company of the 7th Cavalry Brigade. Company Commander Ma Xizhen immediately led his troops to fiercely resist. The Mongolian army, with three times the strength, pressed against our troops. The aircraft flew low to bomb and strafe. Under their joint land and air attack, our army fought bloodily for four days and nights from the 5th to the 8th. The area was gained and lost several times. Finally, at noon on the 8th, the invading Mongolian army was repelled. The enemy left more than thirty bodies behind, including one officer. We captured one Mongolian small cannon, three light machine guns, more than ten rifles, one radio station, and many documents and maps. In addition, three photos, four banknotes, and two gold medals were found on the body of the officer killed. All of these are powerful evidence of the Mongolian army's invasion of our Xinjiang this time. Our casualties were also heavy. Beitashan is still being firmly defended by our army." After receiving the above report, Song Xilian, Commander-in-Chief of the entire region, praised Company Commander Ma Xizhen of the Beitashan garrison and his troops for fighting bloodily for four days and nights under the joint land and air attack of the Mongolian side and the superior strength of several times our force, and for finally being able to defend the position and preserve the national territory. Their loyalty and bravery were deeply commendable. He immediately sent personnel to comfort and reward the soldiers of the company with 5 million national currency. Currently, reinforcements have arrived at the front one after another, and morale is extremely high. Our army is on high alert and will inflict a major blow on the invaders. The more than 30 corpses finally abandoned by the Mongolian army have been buried by our side, and the various captured documents have been transported to Dihua and will be photographed and made public to the world.

### Dongting Lake Project Plan Has Formulated Three Principles

[Report from our newspaper in Changsha, 14th] The Dongting Lake Engineering Office of the Saozi River Water Conservancy Commission moved from Beijing to Hunan. Director Wang Huixian told reporters that the following three principles have been formulated for future engineering plans: (1) The existing lake surface of Dongting Lake must be retained for water storage. (2) All construction plans must benefit both Hunan and Hubei provinces and must not favor one side. (3) Persuade farmers near the lake to dredge rivers and discharge water rather than build dikes for flood control. It is not appropriate to build dikes and embankments in the future, but barren islands without dikes can be reclaimed for planting wheat. Before the flood arrives, the wheat will have been harvested. The office is scheduled to go to the lake area for investigation on the 17th.

### Postal Official Talks About Postal Reform Plan; Cannot Be Implemented as Scheduled Due to Economic Difficulties

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 14th] The postal service has improved somewhat in recent months. According to postal officials: At present, some parts of North China and Northeast China are still unable to improve postal services due to damage caused by the Communists. A comprehensive reform has been planned in South China, Northwest China and Southwest China, but due to the current economic difficulties of the postal service and the limited treasury subsidies, the improvement work cannot be implemented as scheduled. The main reason for the economic difficulties of the postal service is that postal rates are too low. Before the war, the postage for each first-class letter was five cents, but now it is 100 yuan, but the commodity price index is only three cents, and the printing cost of stamps is high. The printing cost of each stamp has recently reached 38 yuan. If you send a letter and pay 100 yuan, the printing cost of the stamp has already cost 38 yuan (if you paste two stamps, the cost of the stamp is 76 yuan). If you send a letter at a postal agency, the agency must deduct at least 20 yuan in handling fees, totaling 58 yuan. The remaining 42 yuan is not enough to cover the post office's collection, transportation, and delivery expenses. For example, the fee for sending sporadic newspapers is 10 yuan per bundle, and buying and affixing one stamp costs 38 yuan. In other words, excluding transportation and delivery costs, the stamps alone cost 28 yuan. It is estimated that the post office loses more than 4 billion yuan per month on the transportation of newspapers alone, and other losses are even greater.

### Review of the Hainan Island Province Establishment Issue

The Hainan Island province establishment issue, which has been brewing for a long time, has been resolved by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting: "First, a special administrative region will be established, and a province establishment committee will be organized at the same time to prepare for the establishment of the province. The chairman will be concurrently held by the chief executive." The Ministry of Interior, together with various competent authorities, drafted a plan for the preparation of the establishment of Hainan Island Province, which is generally completed. It is heard that its content will divide the administrative region into three parts: (1) the mainland part, governing 16 counties south of the Gou Lou Mountains; (2) Hainan Island itself, with 16 counties; (3) the four island groups of the East, West, South, and Central Sands. As for the candidate for chief executive, it is probably already internally determined, and will be announced soon. From this point of view, a new and progressive province in the South China region is about to emerge; not only is the whole country paying close attention to this, but the people of Hainan Island, who have been in turmoil for a long time, are especially placing infinite hope on it. Therefore, the establishment of Hainan Island Province is not only a major measure in our domestic affairs, but it also sufficiently illustrates that the government has paid attention to the South China Sea issue.

Hainan Island, also known as Qiongya, is located in the China Sea, that is, in the northwest corner of the South China Sea, between 18 degrees 9 minutes and 21 degrees 11 minutes north latitude, and 108 degrees 36 minutes and 111 degrees 3 minutes east longitude. It is adjacent to the Gulf of Tonkin to the west, close to Vietnam, about 12 nautical miles across the strait to the northwest, and faces the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong Province. It can be reached by civil aviation in half a day. To the slightly north is Beihai, and further away, it looks east to the Philippines and controls the Nanyang Islands to the south. Its transportation line is located between Singapore and Hong Kong, making it a very important island on my southwest international route. The area of ​​its main island is 2,600 square kilometers, which is 268 square kilometers larger than Taiwan, which has an area of ​​2,332 square kilometers. Taiwan is shaped like a sweet potato, and Hainan Island is roughly the same shape. The economic value of the two islands is equal. Strategically, the two islands are like the two eyes of the China Sea. As for the evolution of its political system, as early as 2,000 years ago, when it belonged internally, the Han Dynasty was Dan'er and Zhuya prefectures, the Sui Dynasty added Linzhen county, all belonging to Yangzhou; the Tang Dynasty changed it to five counties, belonging to Lingnan Dao. The Song Dynasty changed it to Qiongzhou, subordinate to Guangnan West Road; the Yuan Dynasty changed the prefecture to belong to Hunan Province. The Ming Dynasty changed the province to a provincial administration commission, divided into three prefectures, and changed it to belong to Guangdong. The Qing Dynasty established Hainan Dao, divided into Qiongya and Yazhou. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the Qing system was followed to establish Qiongya Dao: after the establishment of the National Government, the Dao was abolished and counties were established, dividing the island into 13 counties, and later adding three counties, totaling 16 counties, as the ninth administrative region of Guangdong Province. On February 10, 1939, Japan occupied the island, determined to develop its ports, and plundered its resources, causing the essence of the island to be lost and the people exhausted. After the victory and restoration, Guangdong Province's management was inadequate, the bureaucracy was corrupt, and bandits rose up, plunging the entire island into a tragic situation. In addition, at a time when France invaded the Xisha Islands, Vietnam was in chaos, and Taiwan was uneasy, Hainan, separated from Guangdong by a strip of water, its important position and the precariousness of its situation, if it is not urgently governed, comforting the displaced and slowly developing it, the future is worrying.

The establishment of Hainan Island Province based on the above situation has great significance. This is not only the request of the people of the island, but also the deep expectation of people across the country. However, the establishment of local political systems involves a myriad of details. In the past, such as the establishment of Xikang Province, and the establishment of Suiyuan, Rehe, and Chahar Provinces; in recent times, such as the establishment of the nine northeastern provinces and Taiwan Province, all caused many problems due to incomplete zoning and chaotic political systems. We learn from the past to avoid future mistakes. In principle, we advocate the establishment of Hainan Island Province. In terms of methods and steps, we advocate widely soliciting opinions from the people and experts, following steps and plans, and slowly completing it, not being too hasty. Now, I express a few points regarding the establishment of the province on the island, hoping that the authorities can pay attention to this.

1. The special administrative region system should be carefully considered. The special administrative region system is an unreasonable provincial system; in the past, the establishment of special regions in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe, and the establishment of the administrative chief system in Taiwan a few years ago, were originally expedient measures and made no contribution to local autonomy. The establishment of special regions in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Rehe was due to ethnic issues between Mongolians and Han Chinese and the failure to establish county governments. After the provincial organization law was established, the special regions were abolished. Taiwan adopted the administrative chief system, forming a special system. It was opposed by the people of Taiwan and has recently been abolished and replaced with the provincial system. Hainan Island has had county governments for more than 30 years. Hainan Island is separated from Taiwan by a sea. Taiwan has already experienced the failure of the chief executive system. It does not seem appropriate to repeat it in Hainan. We believe that there are two steps that can be followed for the establishment of Hainan Province: (1) Adopt the transitional province establishment method of the Xikang Province Establishment Committee, and establish the Hainan Province Establishment Committee, directly under the Executive Yuan, to prepare for the establishment of the province: (2) Announce the establishment of the province after establishing the administrative region.

2. The administrative region should be determined. The so-called administrative region refers to the jurisdiction of the province, such as cities, counties, and administrative bureaus. The government attaches great importance to the establishment of Hainan Province and is bound to establish jurisdiction over the islands of the South China Sea, placing the islands under the provincial system, which is a wise measure. However, after checking, the islands in the South China Sea that belong to Chinese sovereignty include the Dongsha, Xisha, Zhongsha, and Nansha Islands, the Tuan Sha Archipelago, and the Spratly Islands, all of which have strategic value. During the Sino-Japanese War, Dongsha, Xisha, and the Spratly Islands were successively occupied by Japan and placed under the jurisdiction of Kaohsiung, Taiwan. After Japan's surrender, our Ministry of Interior placed them under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Province, and the provincial government, together with the naval authorities, took them over, but did not govern them. Now that Hainan Province is established, county governments should be established on the above islands separately. This is not only to determine the administrative region of the province, but also to determine Chinese sovereignty between 8 degrees north latitude and 111 degrees to 115 degrees 5 minutes east longitude.

3. Regarding the name of the province, according to the government's plan, the name of Hainan Island Province will probably be "Hainan Island," and some people advocate "Qiongya Province." We believe that since Hainan Island and the Dongsha and Xisha Islands are located in the South China Sea, and their territorial waters and territory are all Chinese sovereignty, it is appropriate to name it "South China Sea Province." In order to facilitate the operation and management of the islands in the South China Sea in the future, it will be advantageous to establish the provincial capital in Yulin, which is nearly 145 nautical miles from Xisha.

In short, the establishment of Hainan Island Province is a necessary measure. The earlier the establishment of the province is successful, the fewer days foreigners will covet it. The above is what we have discussed, which is the urgent task of establishing the province. We hope that the government will carefully study it and achieve success!

Vandenberg pointed out that regarding the review of the overseas reconstruction issue, "we may wish to cooperate closely with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe and Asia." Vandenberg's statement stated: "The current targets of official and private efforts are the large-scale new US foreign reconstruction plan after the war to prevent the social and economic collapse of many parts of the world. This reconstruction plan is different from the direct relief plan. The public conduct of these discussions is a good thing. But whether at home or abroad, these discussions should not be misunderstood. At home, these discussions should not cause general anxiety, thinking that we will act hastily or make inappropriate plans. Abroad, these discussions should not be taken as a proof that our overseas friendly countries can rely on us instead of relying on themselves. But there is one extremely important question that has not yet been answered. This question involves completing the conditions for stability and peace. These conditions include peace-loving nations that must achieve self-sufficiency and independence, and also include the interests of the United States itself, which can never thrive in a broken world. I advocate that we must deal with this problem in a comprehensive manner and not just scratch the surface. I believe that the United States must deal with the situation with great courage for its own interests. We must conduct a comprehensive survey of our own resources to determine the limits of our consideration of foreign aid. This is a critical issue, because if the United States relaxes, the hopes of the world will also be relaxed."

[US News Agency, New York, 13th] Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Thorp gave a speech here on Thursday, reviewing the needs of foreign countries and the methods by which they obtain foreign aid (especially from the United States). It is said that the disconnect between the two has made the problem increasingly difficult. He analyzed that if the slow economic recovery of certain regions is to be resolved, it is necessary to continue to provide a large amount of aid from the United States, and at the same time, the policies and plans of these countries should be re-examined. Thorp told the meeting of the American Business Council that, to date, "the amount of foreign loans and aid allocated by the United States has reached 13 billion US dollars. Of this amount, about 9 billion US dollars has been spent." He continued: "This expenditure does not include US donations to international institutions. But when paying, it is actually not money, 'most of it is materials and services provided by the United States to support the economies of other countries.'"

### Blunt Warning from Brown: Directed at Some Korean Leaders, Seemingly at Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee

[United Press, Seoul, 14th] At a banquet hosted by the mayor of Seoul for the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission last night, U.S. Major General Brown stated: Any Korean leader who refuses to represent the people and accept the consultation of the commission will be deprived of their rights. Observers unanimously believe that Brown's words were directed at Kim Koo, as Syngman Rhee had previously declared that Chiang Kai-shek urged others to accept the consultation of the Joint Commission. However, both Rhee and Kim themselves still refuse to consult before the U.S. and the Soviet Union clarify the definitions of democratic rights and trusteeship. Brown bluntly warned a few Korean leaders hesitant to fully support the work of the Joint Commission. They are indeed deluded by illusory dangers, deeply fearing "deceitful schemes" between the lines of the Moscow Agreement. If they could conduct a detailed and impartial study of the Moscow Agreement, such concerns would naturally disappear. At this critical juncture, illusory errors should not be allowed to wreak havoc, squandering the golden opportunity for a unified temporary Korean government that the people unanimously desire. According to the mayor, Kim Koo and Syngman Rhee were invited to last night's banquet, but neither of them attended in the end.

Although France once resisted the tyrannical government of Italy, it harbors no hatred towards the Italian people. France deeply admires the wartime underground resistance fighters of Italy and believes that once the treaty is ratified, the traditional relations between the two countries will be restored, and they will move forward along the path of former partners.

### Three Representatives Visit Director Wu, Presenting Difficulties of Business and Industry; Wu Explains Restoration of Base Salary Impossible; Salary Based on Last Month's Index Will Be Considered

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Xu Jiqing, the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jin Runzhao, a director, and Wu Yunshi, the chairman of the Industrial Association, visited Wu Kaixian, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, at 11 a.m. yesterday to present the current difficulties of business and industry and put forward four requests: (1) Restore wages to the base salary of 1936. (2) Economic fluctuations are uncertain, and it is difficult for business and industry products to calculate costs. The monthly wages of all manufacturers should be based on the index of the previous month. (3) All closures and layoffs should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Law and should be given advance notice. (4) Stop illegal actions of arbitrary strikes and slowdowns.

### Pre-War Wages Do Not Meet Standards

Director Wu gave a reply one by one, saying: (1) During the rule of the concessions at that time, the wages of workers were low, and their lives were mostly substandard. Now the Social Affairs Bureau has no reason to make workers return to such a life. It is true that some workers have been given too much, but this cannot be generalized, so it is impossible to immediately require a uniform return to the base salary of 1936. (2) The proposed request can be considered. The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee will convene a meeting next week, and the Industrial Association has already submitted a proposal, which will be discussed and decided by the Evaluation Committee.

### Layoff Methods Can Be Considered

(3) According to the layoff method for workers during the Shanghai Reinstatement Period, the severance pay was issued for a minimum of three months and a maximum of one year, two years, or even longer. Later, the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee revised it to a minimum of half a month and a maximum of three months. This move was to protect factories and was also a painstaking effort. The business and industry community did not object to the unreasonable method at the time, but now they are dissatisfied with the revised and improved method, which is not reasonable. The current layoff method has no basis in the Factory Law, which I also admit, so legally speaking, this point can be considered. (4) The matter of stopping illegal actions by workers was previously submitted to the Municipal Council for discussion, and the mayor and the police bureau agreed. The Social Affairs Bureau and the police bureau have jointly issued a notice to stop such actions, and it is believed that such situations will be reduced in the future.

During the talks, they were very agreeable to each other. Xu, Jin, and Wu agreed to convey Director Wu's opinions to the members.

### Local Association Reorganizes Association Affairs; Held General Membership Meeting Yesterday; Promoting Prosperity and Seeking Welfare for Citizens; Will Assist the Government in the Spirit of the Past

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Local Association held a general membership meeting at the Pudong Native Place Association on Zhongzheng East Road at 4 p.m. yesterday, attended by President Du Yuesheng, Vice Presidents Wang Xiaoying and Qian Xinzhi, and members Pan Gongzhan, Huang Yanpei, Lu Jingshi, Wu Kaixian, Xu Jiqing, Luo Qinghua, Zhang Shizhao, and others, more than two hundred people. The meeting discussed the articles of association, elected directors, supervisors, and secretaries, and passed a declaration. The meeting adjourned at around 6 p.m.

After performing the etiquette, President Du first gave a speech, hoping that the members of the association would assist the government in the spirit of the past and strive for the stability and revival of the city. Then, Xu Jiqing, a member, reported on the association's affairs, saying: The predecessor of the Shanghai Municipal Local Association was the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association, which was initiated and organized by leaders from all walks of life in the city during the January 28th Incident. In response to the needs of the time, it supplemented the government's deficiencies in local order, market finance, and the supply of front-line military needs. After the signing of the Shanghai-Songhu Truce Agreement, the people knew that the enemy's ambition was still in its infancy. In order to encourage them to strive and concentrate their efforts for the future and prepare for the unexpected, it was reorganized into the Shanghai Municipal Local Association. Therefore, in terms of evolution, this association began with the War of Resistance Against Japan; in terms of meaning, the work of this association was not to strive to be the forerunner of mobilizing the people. From 1932 to the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan was the first period. On the one hand, the work of the association was devoted to social undertakings, such as the education of children, with the Zhabei Civilian Education Institute and the Minhang Guangci Orphanage, and the improvement of rural areas, with the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Committee. On the other hand, the statistics on Shanghai's food and other items were compiled annually by the Shanghai Municipal Statistical Committee. And with regard to local reforms, it cooperated with public organizations to promote them at any time. At that time, in order to prepare for the incident, the central government implemented civil training. This association took the lead in advocating and, in response to the situation, quietly observed the evolution, invited interested people to give lectures and discuss, and improve the level of awareness. After the War of Resistance Against Japan began, this association almost became a rear support center, providing relief and rescue. This association almost became a rear support center, condolences and donations were divided into departments, each responsible for their own duties. In addition, it used its remaining strength to assist the northern and southern battlefields, relieve unemployed workers, and encourage factories to relocate internally in a timely manner to maintain production. When the national army withdrew, the society was in the hands of demons in the north and south cities. The society leaders were forced to leave Shanghai one after another, and the handling of association affairs was handed over to Xu Ciacheng. In the midst of difficulties, it continued to work tirelessly. During this period, such as the solicitation of various public debts, the protection of staff, the urgent raising of funds, the assistance of travelers from Sichuan, the maintenance of the lives of those who stayed behind, and the communication and liaison with Hong Kong and Chongqing were maintained, even after the outbreak of the Pacific War, until the enemy surrendered, it was twisted and turned, and it was never interrupted. The name of the local association has always been clean and has never been used by the enemy puppets. The Commander-in-Chief Chiang's surrender instruction to the enemy was transmitted by the secret radio station connected by the local association. When the victory was approaching, the association began to recover. Due to the long-term separation of members, it was urgent to re-investigate and reorganize the association's affairs. A preparatory meeting for the reinstatement was held on February 15 last year. After the meeting, old members were re-registered and new members were absorbed. To date, there are more than 500 new and old members.

After the report, Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Huang Yanpei, and others successively made speeches, praising the work led by the society leader and hoping that the local association would continue to work hard to revive Shanghai.

Then, the articles of association were discussed and passed, saying, "The purpose of the local association is to assist in social construction, promote local prosperity, and seek welfare for citizens." Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Wang Xiaolai, Shui Xiangyun, and other thirty-three people were elected as directors, Wei Rushan, Yang Yinpu, and other eleven people were elected as alternate directors, Li Shizeng, Yu Guitang, Wang Yansong, and other eleven people were elected as supervisors, Zhu Huiqing and other three people were elected as alternate supervisors, and Zhang Shizhao was the secretary-general, responsible for practical work. Finally, a declaration was passed.

### Amidst Central Government's Financial Difficulties: National Education Conference Canceled; National Games and National Art Exhibition Also Canceled

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] During the current session of the National Political Council, some opposed the Ministry of Education's plan to convene a National Education Conference this autumn. Their reasoning was that 90% of the proposals resolved at past National Education Conferences had not been implemented. At a time when the central government's finances are strained and schools are severely lacking in equipment, it would be better to transfer the billions of yuan budgeted for the National Education Conference to emergency equipment funding for schools. Recently, the Executive Yuan also rejected the National Art Exhibition due to budgetary constraints, and rejected requests for subsidies for the National Games. Both events will not be held. Furthermore, UNESCO planned to convene a Far East regional basic education conference in the capital this September. The Ministry of Education had requested 3.9 billion yuan from the Executive Yuan to cover all conference expenses and to subsidize the upgrading of equipment at excellent schools in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou for foreign visitors to see. The Executive Yuan also significantly reduced the allocation due to limited funds. Sources indicate that this year's National Education Conference will also be canceled.

### National Bank Agrees to Bear Losses for Sale of Yarn and Cloth in Nanyang Markets: Types of Cotton Textiles Under Negotiation

Due to rampant smuggling and a sharp drop in overseas market prices, while domestic costs cannot be suppressed due to the lifting of the cost of living index, the legitimate export of yarn, cloth, and cotton products to Nanyang markets has been severely impacted.

The National Bank will compensate for the losses, and the foreign exchange obtained will also be purchased by the National Bank. Reporters inquired with the Fangjian Corporation, and it was stated that although the principle of selling to Nanyang has been decided by the National Bank, the quantity to be sold is still under consideration. This quantity is based on 10% of the output of Fangjian companies in various regions to be shipped to Nanyang, so the quantity is considerable. To facilitate transportation, products from the Shanghai and Qingdao Fangjian factories may be allocated for transportation. Also, there are many types of cotton textiles, and the Joint Operating Company and the National Bank are still in negotiations. The principle is the same as for yarn and cloth, and they will be exported on their behalf, possibly handled by the National Goods Joint Operating Company.

Subsequently, pig iron from Anshan, North China, and Taiwan was shipped to Shanghai one after another, and the problem of iron shortage was resolved. The supply of pig iron will be smooth in the future, so there will be no shortage of pig iron in Shanghai. (2) Wire Rod. Wire rod is a necessary material for manufacturing various needles, iron wires, lead wires, stranded ropes, etc. In the past, there was also a shortage. Most steel rolling mills used scrap iron plates instead to meet the urgent needs of the market, but because the composition was not suitable and the length was insufficient, the quality of the finished product was difficult to meet the standards. However, recently, 1,000 tons of round steel ordered by the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company Rolling Mill from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company have been shipped to Shanghai one after another and will soon start construction. In addition, the company's open-hearth steel will also be smelted, which can be used for self-pouring steel coins for rolling steel, so the problem of wire rod supply can be solved. (3) Various light-pound square steel and ribbed steel materials for construction and machinery. The local steel rolling mills in this city can only produce a part of the needs, and most of them still rely on imports from other ports. For example, Anshan in Northeast China can produce a large quantity. In the past two or three months, there have been quite a few foreign goods imported, and most of them are orders from last year. This kind of material can be manufactured domestically, so the import of foreign goods should be prohibited. (4) Iron Sheet. Black iron sheet and tinplate are still in short supply on the market to date. Before the domestic steel mills have products, the import of foreign goods cannot be avoided. Fortunately, Anshan Iron and Steel Company is preparing to roll iron sheets of numbers 16 to 26 in the near future and ship them to Shanghai for supply.

Fangjian Cloth Sales

[Our Report] China Fangjian Corporation sold cloth yesterday as usual, with a total of 10,390 pieces sold and 260 quilts sold. Fourteen manufacturers applied to purchase, for a total of 56 pieces, and 334 cloth shops applied for a total of 9,830 pieces and 260 quilts.

### Exchange Settlement Period for Exported Consignment Goods Extended to 30 Days

[Our Report] The Central Bank issued Circular No. 102 yesterday to various designated banks regarding the handling of foreign exchange settlement for exported consignment goods before February 17, 1947, stating that the deadline for the delivery of foreign exchange for exported consignment goods before February 17 of this year, as stipulated in the Bank's Circular No. 91, has expired. In order to facilitate the promotion and sale of consignment goods by exporters, the deadline for the delivery of foreign exchange is extended again from May 25 of this year for a period of 30 days, and no further extension will be granted after the deadline. It is hoped that customers will be notified to strictly abide by this. Otherwise, the exchange rate for the delivery of foreign exchange after the goods are sold out will still be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's Circular No. 86. This circular is hereby issued for your reference and compliance.

### Tea Market Transactions Not Brisk Early On, Export Trade Quiet

Yesterday, the tea market transactions in foreign firms were still extremely weak. Several Chinese export companies are currently rushing to pack various grades purchased a few days ago. In addition, the continuous rain dampened enthusiasm for activity. The trend is that those holding goods remain steadfast, and the market continues to fluctuate. Various domestic teas are selling reasonably well in local shops and among merchants from other areas, and prices are quite stable. According to people in the trade, low-end black tea has recently regained favor in Suzhou and other places, and prices are not too demanding, so considerable transactions may occur in the coming days. It is also learned that the demand from Tianjin merchants for non-war silk and tea buds continues to be uncertain due to stalled negotiations, and the process is temporarily unclear.

### Woolen Fabrics See High Prices Again

Yesterday, in the woolen fabric market, except for summer goods remaining unchanged, autumn and winter goods saw repeated high prices. Merchants from Qiyi Street mostly refused to sell, and the trend at the tea houses was consistently firm and bullish. Based on the principle of exchanging one bolt of woolen fabric for one dan of white rice, all firms expect to see the yarn market improve. However, due to the lack of a continuous supply, insufficient inventory, and declining production, factory prices are higher than spot prices. Rumors of profitable purchases pervade the market.

### National Bank Discount Committee Approves 3 Billion Yuan in Industrial Loans

[Our Dispatch] The Industrial Loan Review Committee of the Central Bank Discount Committee held its eleventh meeting on the afternoon of the 13th. A total of nineteen committee members, including Zhu Tongjiu, attended. Twenty-one loan applications were approved, totaling approximately 3 billion yuan. Furthermore, the committee had previously organized a subcommittee to discuss the standards for lenient and strict reviews of industrial loans. After two meetings, the subcommittee drafted four articles of the "Central Bank Discount Committee Procedures for Reviewing Industrial Loan Cases." This draft was also revised and approved by yesterday's review committee and sent to the Discount Committee for approval.

### Public Reserve Funds Cannot Be Included in Capital

Reserves Still Subject to Taxation

The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce recently received a telegram from the Direct Taxation Bureau stating that the revised Income Tax Law and its implementing regulations do not clearly specify whether one-third of the public reserve fund of Category I profit-seeking enterprises should be included in the calculation of capital as a precedent, or whether the year-end reserve fund should be included in the calculation of net profit for taxation. Now, a telegram from the Direct Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance indicates that the public reserve fund cannot have one-third included in the calculation of capital and that the public reserve fund to be set aside in the current year cannot be deducted from the net profit for taxation when calculating the income amount. The Chamber of Commerce has forwarded the above instructions to all businesses for compliance.

### First Batch of Export Silk Suffers a Projected Loss of 7 Billion

According to a person in charge of the Silk Weaving Guidance Association, labor costs have nearly doubled since the de-freezing of the cost of living index. The budget for the first phase of export silk fabrics has been insufficient after adding the increased labor costs in May and June. The association has already compiled the budget table for the first phase of profit and loss and submitted it to the authorities for review. (1) A total of 86,550 bolts have been woven, with 57,048 bolts finished and 29,502 bolts unfinished. (2) 186,602 pounds of raw silk are required (equivalent to 1,400 dan), totaling 156,745,800.00 yuan in legal tender. (3) 460,067 pounds of rayon are required (2,300 cases), totaling 271,440,000.00 yuan in legal tender. (4) The total cost is 54,504,180,000.00 yuan. (5) The total selling price is 47,634,370,000.00 yuan. The difference results in a loss of 6,869,810,000.00 yuan. The above budget is based on the rupee price converted from the selling price per yard in India (the rupee price is 3,400 yuan).

(Another dispatch) Export silk fabrics are being gradually developed for India, Singapore, and Southeast Asia. The future of the first phase of finished products would have been very promising if labor costs had not increased so sharply. Now, they are in a difficult environment. However, the Guidance Association is preparing a plan for the continued weaving of the second phase and submitting it to the authorities for review. As for the request for 20 billion yuan in payment for goods, it is said that the authorities are reviewing it and a decision should be made within days.

### The Northeast Corner of the Inferno—The Communist Army is Mobilizing, Eager to Succeed—The War Situation Will See New Developments in Two Weeks

— Changchun, 4th [of the month], Air Dispatch. Our Correspondent Zhao Zhan

The summer offensive launched by the Communist army in the Northeast has rapidly expanded from the Songhua River basin to the Liao River basin, sweeping across the fertile areas of the Songyuan Plain like an adverse storm. After a period of intense destruction, the Northeast seems to have suffered severe paralysis. From this perspective, the economic and political significance of the Communist army's offensive is far more important than the military significance.

Historically, the northeastern border has often been a breeding ground for unrest, and this remains true today. The creation of the Communist army's power in the Northeast depends on the superior agricultural economic conditions. The alluvial plains formed along the Heilongjiang River, Ussuri River, and Songhua River in the northern part are fertile and rich in agricultural products, known as the "granary." The source of able-bodied men and military rations is thus worry-free. Extending its wings from Harbin, west to Fuyu and east to Yanji, it forms a crescent shape, eyeing the gateway to the Changji area. Harbin is the former command post of the Chinese Communist Party in the Northeast, issuing orders from here, resembling the "red capital" of the Northeast.

Benefits of Geography

Due to the benefits of geography, the Northeast Communist army can obtain foreign aid. In previous battles, a small number of Korean Communist troops and Mongolian cavalry were discovered, and in the recent offensive, their numbers have surged, estimated to total around 100,000. At the same time, Soviet-style weapons were found in the war spoils captured by the National Army.

From this offensive, it can be seen that the Northeast Communist army is using a long-term war of attrition as a military struggle to overthrow the government, using space to buy time. At the same time, it is launching an economic struggle, conducting war to support war. The Communist army invades the recovered areas, seizing food and kidnapping able-bodied men, implementing their "scorched earth" policy.

The Northeast Communist army claims to occupy Changchun, meet in Luoyang, and admire the moon at Shanhaiguan during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. Just look at how boastful they are!

Three Ambitions for Southern Invasion

Military strategists predict that the Communist army's attempt to invade the South this time has three purposes: (1) From Harbin and Dalian, attack north and south along the Chinese Eastern Railway, meeting in Shenyang. The main purpose is to contain the National Army's takeover of Dalian. (2) Open up a corridor from Outer Mongolia to North Korea, control three-quarters of the Northeast's area, and prevent the National Army from taking over Harbin. (3) Use a comprehensive mobile warfare to strike the National Army's field army while conducting widespread raids and destruction, plunging society into chaos and turning the Northeast into the second Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The National Army is also keenly aware of its scheme and is actively deploying, and a major battle will begin soon. The end of this battle will be in two months at the shortest or two months at the longest. And the restoration of traffic will take at least half a year.

Around mid-April, when news of Lin Biao's death was rampant, the Communist army north of the Songhua River gathered in the area along the Songhua River in Harbin. Around Yushu, Shuangcheng, and Wukeshu, a crowd of 100,000 was assembled. The unit designations are the First Column, First, Second, and Third Divisions; the Second Column, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Divisions; the Independent First Division; the Independent Second Division; the Mongolian Cavalry Brigade; and a portion of the security forces. The action to invade southward on a large scale had already been decided.

In early May, the Communist army crossed the river from Fuyu. On the 12th, the Fourth and Fifth Divisions of the Communist army approached the outskirts of Nong'an. The Battle of Huanglong began. However, the Communist army approached the northern suburbs and contacted the defending troops. Knowing the strength of the defending army, it feigned an attack with a portion of its forces, while the main force attacked Huai'de southeast of Changchun via the western territory of Changchun County. The attack on the city began on the 14th. The three divisions of the Communist army's First Column and the Independent First Division took turns attacking using a wheel warfare tactic. One regiment of the 30th Division of the defending army fought bitterly, sacrificing more than half of its soldiers. They broke through the northern side of Changxiao on the 18th, and Guo Changxiang Dianyuan died for the country. The Second Column encountered the 88th Division of the 71st Army, which had advanced from Siping to disturb Huai'de, in the Daheilizi area. The National Army launched a hasty attack, using fewer forces to control a larger number of troops, and suffered losses due to the unfavorable terrain. The Communist army then occupied Gongzhuling, an important town on the Chinese Eastern Railway, in the afternoon of the 19th, cutting off traffic between Changchun and Panjin. A portion of its forces came north to contain Changchun, and the majority of its forces moved south.

The Communist Army on the Pingmei Line

After the Communist army captured Huai'de and Gongzhuling, the National Army that had attacked from Siping retreated to the south bank of the Dongliao River to defend the outskirts of Siping. The First and Second Columns of the Communist army crossed the Dongliao River from Yitong County and advanced towards Siping. The Independent Second Division captured Bianyang County northeast of Yitong on the 22nd and then raided along the Jihai line. The Independent First Division and its affiliated units were entrenched between Huai'de, Gongzhuling, Liling, and Changchun. The Battle of Siping began on the 22nd. Outlying strongholds of Siping, such as Guojia Dian, Shilibu, Hafu, Bamiancheng, and Old Siping, were successively captured by the Communist army, but Siping ultimately had no chance to be exploited. Until the afternoon of the 25th, the Communist army retreated from the entire line outside Siping, detouring south of Siping. The Fourth and Fifth Divisions of the First Column invaded the vicinity of Changtu via the west side of Siping. The First and Third Divisions of the First Column raided the southeast of Siping, threatening Kaiyuan. Two divisions of troops were still stationed outside Siping. Just as the war in Siping eased, the situation on the Pingmei Line became tense again.

The Communist army on the Pingmei Line gathered 80,000 troops. The unit designations are the Third Column, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Divisions; the Fourth Column, Tenth and Eleventh Divisions; the Independent Second Division from north of the Songhua River; the Korean Independent Division; the Li Hongxian Branch of the Korean Communist Party; and the First Security Brigade. Starting on the 23rd, they besieged Meihekou, attacking fiercely day and night. On the night of the 29th, Meihekou was finally captured. Chen Kaiwen's troops of the 184th Division of the defending army fought bravely, fulfilling the highest strategic task. After the Communist army occupied Meihekou, it divided its forces into two routes: one route went south to jointly attack Changtu, and the other route went north, seemingly intending to invade Jilin.

Three Routes to Attack Jilin

When the outskirts of Changchun were tense, the Communist army in eastern Jilin also began to stir. Cao Lihuai, the leader of the Communist army in the Jilin Military Region, decided on a plan to attack Jilin in three routes. One route attacked Jilin from the area north of Jiangmifeng. One route crossed the river near Baiqitun, attacked Wulajie, went south to Tumenling, and detoured to Jilin. One route crossed the river from Jiaohe via Xindian (southeast of Jilin) and attacked Xiaofengman. The Communist army's strength on the outskirts of Jilin was about 80,000 troops, including the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Divisions of the Sixth Column, the Independent Third Division, the Second Security Brigade, and the 24th and 25th Brigades.

On the morning of May 14, a portion of the Communist army attacking Jilin from Jiangmifeng raided Xinjilin, 10 miles north of Jilin, confronting the National Army across the river. Clear gunshots and artillery fire could be heard from Jilin. In the afternoon of the 14th, the National Army crossed the river and counterattacked, driving the Communist army back to Datun, north of Jilin. The Communist army that crossed the river from Baiqitun occupied Wulajie on the morning of the 20th, but was stopped by the National Army south of Wulajie and has not succeeded so far. More than 10,000 Communist troops carrying heavy weapons attacked Xiaofengman starting on the 19th. The war on the east bank of the Second Songhua River was extremely fierce for days. The Communist army tried repeatedly, but failed to attack, suffering heavy casualties, and retreated in the face of difficulties. For two weeks from May 20 to today, the outskirts of Jilin have been relatively peaceful.

Exhausted Troops Suffer Defeat

Currently, the Communist army is using all its strength to attack Changtu. If the Communist army advances further on the agenda of Kaiyuan, it is Tieling, the gateway to Shenyang. Shenyang has already prepared for defense. At the same time, the Communist army transporting troops in large quantities in southern Liaoning has also taken action. They have made tentative attacks in Fuxian and Pulandian, apparently intending to create a full-scale offensive in the Northeast. However, the Communist army's forces are scattered widely, and they are now at the end of their rope. If they can flee to the vicinity of Shenyang, they will be exhausted troops and will undoubtedly bring about their own defeat.

In short, the Communist army's offensive this time is mobilizing all its forces, seeking only to succeed once and completely abandoning the rear. The total mobilized force reaches 300,000, but only half of the troops have combat experience. The remaining half are new recruits without combat experience, and their combat strength is very weak. The reason why they can carry out widespread and in-depth guerrilla warfare is because the National Army is suffering from too few troops, so few that even the defending forces on the inner line feel insufficient. Recently, reinforcements are being transported to the Northeast, and the war situation will have new developments in two weeks.

### Amidst Calls from All Quarters to Take Back the "Monte Carlo of the Orient"—Macau — Hong Kong, 6th [of the month], Air Dispatch

— Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng

The National Senate's 15th General Assembly passed a motion on the 31st of last month to "recover Lushun and Dalian ports and Macau as soon as possible." At the same time, provincial and municipal senates and councils have also passed resolutions to recover Macau. The Guangdong Provincial Senate and various legal entities have even organized a "Committee to Promote the Recovery of Macau" to study specific plans and take practical actions. It can be seen that recovering Macau is a unanimous call from all over the country. In order to investigate the local situation, I recently went to Macau twice. What is recorded below is my observation after the investigation.

Encroached Upon, Territory Lost

The Portuguese enjoyed a prominent period in the 16th century. At that time, their power extended from Europe to India, Ceylon, the South Seas Islands, and even South America in the Western Hemisphere. The extent of their territory was no less than that of the current British Empire. In 1530 AD (the early years of the Ming Zhengde reign), Portuguese people were sent to Macau for the first time. Later, more and more Portuguese people came and forcibly occupied Shangchuan Island, Langbai濖, and the Magge Temple, among other places. Since the Ming Dynasty had no power to drive them away, it compromised by stipulating that they would pay a rent of 500 taels per year. In 1849 (the 29th year of the Qing Daoguang reign), the people of Macau deeply resented the Portuguese for acting arbitrarily and killed the first governor, Amaral. The Portuguese government used this as a pretext to make serious representations to the Qing court. Not only was the rent canceled, but even China's customs could not exist. By the 13th year of the Guangxu reign, the Portuguese saw that China was facing multiple problems, so they officially declared Macau to be their territory. In 1888, China and Portugal signed a treaty in which China agreed that the Portuguese would have exclusive jurisdiction over Macau, but they could not transfer this right to other countries. In this way, although Macau was not formally ceded, in fact, Macau had become a Portuguese colony.

Macau is connected to Zhongshan County, the hometown of the Father of the Nation, and the Portuguese's area of jurisdiction was gradually encroached upon. There was no formally stipulated boundary. The foolish ministers of the late Qing Dynasty believed that Macau was a small place and did not care about its gains and losses. In the Sino-Portuguese Boundary Treaty of the first year of the Xuantong reign, a large area of territory was lost in confusion. The current area of Macau is no smaller than that of Hong Kong.

Opium, Gambling, and Prostitution—Three Malpractices

The Portuguese have consistently adopted a high-handed approach to governing Macau. In order to increase tax revenue, they have used all means possible. Everyone knows that Macau is the "Monte Carlo of the Orient," attracting tourists with opium, gambling, and prostitution. Opium was handled by the Monopoly Bureau, and opium dens were everywhere in the streets and alleys. After the end of World War II, in order to avoid international condemnation, the Portuguese government ordered the Governor of Macau to issue a ban on opium on July 1 of last year, stipulating a ban on sales and smoking, and ordering all stored opium to be handed over to the government. On the surface, they banned opium, but the people of Macau only need to pay money to the Health Bureau to obtain a "permit" and can openly buy opium and smoke it freely. The best part is that the government uses the confiscated opium and sells it back to licensed opium smokers at a high price. This ridiculous ban on opium has increased their unexpected income. Gambling is openly allowed. The most luxurious Central Casino is bustling with activity day and night. There are more than 50 other casinos of all sizes in the city, mainly dealing with Fan-Tan and Yin Pai. In addition, there are Shan Pu Piao, Bai Ge Piao, Ma Gou Piao , and other new and strange forms of gambling, with draws held every day. The Portuguese can earn 600,000 yuan a month from casinos alone, exploiting overseas Chinese and profiting from them. How malicious is their intention! Brothels are divided into three grades: the high-end ones are on Rua da Felicidade, Travessa da Felicidade, Rua de Cinco de Outubro, Rua de Inácio Baptista, Rua do Volong and Rua Nova. The middle-class ones are on Rua do Campo and Rua da Boa Vista, and the lower-class ones are on Rua dos Mercadores and Rua dos Ourives. The Macau government also earns a lot of money from prostitutes.

Afraid of Recovery, Fierce in Appearance, Weak in Reality

The Portuguese in Macau were nominally neutral during World War II, but in reality, they helped the evildoers. The Japanese could set up special service agencies in international hotels and openly kill our political workers. The date when this blood debt can be settled is unknown. After the surrender of the Japanese, the Portuguese saw that the general trend was gone and feared that our country would recover Macau by force, so they transferred many troops from East Africa to strengthen their defenses. They still oppressed the Chinese people residing in Macau at will, indicating that they would never give up Macau. However, this fierceness in appearance could not hide their inner panic. It is interesting that they are unusually strict about checking the news. Any news that is even slightly unfavorable to Macau is absolutely not allowed to be published. Newspapers from Hong Kong and Guangzhou must be checked by them before they are allowed to be sold. Therefore, newspapers from Hong Kong and Guangdong are often confiscated. Even a short essay about "mixed-race children" caused the Hong Kong Sing Tao Daily to be withheld. A Westerner wrote to the Hong Kong South China Morning Post, saying, "The Macau government confiscated your newspaper because you published news that China would recover Macau. But why do they allow Macau newspapers to publish news that China will recover Hong Kong?" These words are humorous enough.

Recently, the Macau government, seeing that the calls for our country to recover Macau are rising daily, feels even more at a loss. In addition to stepping up the blockade of news, they have also sent a large number of secret agents to Zhongshan County and Guangzhou to inquire about news. They even made a fool of themselves due to inaccurate reporting. It turns out that Zhao Yu, the leader of the "Minzhi Party," wanted to establish a branch in Macau, so he brought a group of followers to Macau to inspect. After getting off the ship, the Portuguese detectives had already been monitoring him. When he was receiving a grand reception from local party members at the Central Hotel, the police suddenly asked him to talk. When he arrived at the police station, the director politely ordered Zhao Yu to leave the country immediately. Zhao, as an important figure of the "Minzhi Party," could not endure such an insult, so he took out a passport from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to argue with reason. As a result, the Portuguese ignored him and forcibly escorted him out of the country with armed police. Later, Zhao arrived in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, received reporters, and reported the details of the insults he suffered. In fact, the Portuguese's motive for expelling him was that they were reportedly Zhao Yu's visit to Macau was related to the recovery of Macau. The Portuguese's fierce appearance and weakness in reality are another clear proof.

Population Decline, Loneliness and Desolation

Macau was abnormally prosperous during the war and flourished for a while. After the war, residents moved to the interior one after another, and the population of Macau decreased sharply from 600,000 to 200,000. Moreover, most of those who moved away were wealthy businessmen. Macau's prosperity disappeared with the war in an instant. The current situation in Macau is one of loneliness and desolation, shrouded in an atmosphere of extreme economic downturn. Opium is semi-public, so we will not talk about it for the time being. The largest Central Casino is deserted, and those who place bets are mostly from the working class. Five or ten yuan is considered a large sum. The other casinos can be imagined. Most of the prostitutes have also moved to Hong Kong. Teahouses and restaurants have few customers, and all of them are calling for "price cuts." There is really a feeling of not being able to overcome the differences between the present and the past.

Because of the large decline in population and the market falling, the houses in the high-end residential areas are mostly empty and uninhabited. The low rent is self-evident. Rice, flour, vegetables, fish, and shrimp are all cheaper than in Hong Kong. Macau has no soul. It is heading towards the abyss of decline, perhaps a sign that the end of the Portuguese regime is approaching!

### The Golden Age of Luxury Goods Has Passed: Diamond Supply Exceeds Demand

Diamonds were once popular during the war, but this golden age is coming to an end. Demand for industrial and jewelry diamonds has decreased, and prices are falling. To stabilize the market, diamond production may be reduced.

Industrial diamonds were once rare and highly sought after, but now the market is flooded with them. This industry flourished during the war, but now supply exceeds demand.

Jewelry diamonds were the top-selling luxury item in recent years, but sales have also become sluggish. The reasons for the decline in both types of diamonds can be summarized as follows:

(1) Consumers have less money than before. High wages during the war absorbed countless new customers into the luxury goods market, all vying to buy diamonds. However, due to job reductions, the income of the new middle class has decreased, and they are no longer as eager to purchase luxury goods.

(2) With the influx of cars, refrigerators, furniture, and other items into the market, consumers are spending their money elsewhere.

(3) Retail stores are no longer as eager to promote diamonds as they were during the war due to increased inventory.

Before the war, diamond sales accounted for an average of 10% of jewelers' total turnover, but during the war, due to the scarcity of other commodities, this suddenly increased to 40% to 50%.

In the United States, which accounts for the largest share of global diamond production, prices are falling across the board. Retail prices are down 15% from last year's peak, wholesale prices are down 20%, small diamonds are down about 10%, and lower-quality diamonds are down 30%.

Retailers are facing high inventories and sluggish sales, which will inevitably drive diamond prices down.

The Diamond Producers Association, which controls 95% of the world's production, is taking preventative measures to prevent further price declines.

The association's main method for stabilizing diamond prices is to reduce production. The association has proposed limiting this year's diamond supply to 60% of the 1946 level. Diamond cutters and polishers have agreed to cooperate and reduce working hours.

Regulating diamond prices by adjusting production has been a feature of the industry for 50 years. This not only protects the interests of the industry, but also protects the interests of diamond holders, as one of the reasons people buy diamonds is to maintain a valuable and portable asset that is not at risk of devaluation.

American diamond merchants are launching a campaign to abolish the 20% diamond tax, as this tax is affecting the sales of valuable gemstones.

The drop in diamond prices is not a tragedy, but a return to normalcy. Diamond sales are still better than before the war. The world sales of the Diamond Producers Association totaled $37,000,000 in 1937, $42,000,000 in 1942, and $120,000,000 in 1946.

The global diamond supply is largely controlled by the London-based Diamond Producers Association. The association is mainly composed of British, South African, and Belgian capital, and conducts military mining in the Belgian Congo and the Union of South Africa.

Although individual diamond mines exist in South Africa, Tanganyika, Brazil, Venezuela, and other places, their output is small and does not threaten the London association's dominant position in the world market.

Because diamond production is strictly controlled, the temporary oversupply will soon be adjusted, and diamond prices will stabilize and not continue to fall. (Translated from the May 6th "World Report" weekly)

Spring and Autumn

Where is Chinese Art Going?

### Natural Art

— Li Shizeng

This topic is too broad, and I don't know where to start. I can only limit myself to one of my ideas, which could also be said to be one of the paths of Chinese art, which is what I call "natural art" or "natural painting," or "natural painting"; it can also be said to be "painting without learning." I have done many experiments. Does anyone sympathize with my "lack of learning" in painting? I smile!

### Put Your Soul into Your Paintings

— Fang Junbi

Throughout history, our country has left behind many brilliant works of art. Even today, we dare not compare ourselves with foreign countries in everything else, but we can be proud of our ancient literature and art, and we can feel no shame when talking to others, which allows us to still have a foothold in world culture. How grateful we should be to our ancestors! How hard we should work to protect and promote their unfinished work! Sadly, in the past hundred years, we have not only failed to promote it or intensify our work, but we have not even fulfilled our responsibility to preserve it. Not only can we not preserve it, but we sometimes even destroy it. Think about how unfilial this is and how sorry we are to our ancestors.

"Strive to survive." In this competitive world, this is true not only for countries but also for art. We do not necessarily have to worship foreign countries, nor do we necessarily have to imitate the ancients. In terms of painting, whether it is Western painting or Chinese painting, the difference is only in form and tools. Painters can freely choose to express their feelings. If the feelings are sincere, then they can succeed with any tool. Therefore, no matter whether the painting is simple or complex, freehand or symbolic, methodical or unmethodical, as long as it comes from sincerity, it can become an immortal work. What is sincerity? It is to express one's own soul, not to imitate, not to copy, and even less to steal. Put your whole soul into the painting. When you put down your brush, you must abandon all thoughts of gain, factionalism, and then you will have no scruples and will not want to cater to the tastes of the world or be exploited by some kind of pressure. In addition to "sincerity," being cultivated by poetry, lyrics, and music, and having moral and literary cultivation, history can increase knowledge, and landscapes can broaden the mind. In this way, with a perfect soul, the work will naturally be detached. Even if you don't practice much or have enough skill, you won't be reduced to being low-level or vulgar. Whether it's Western painting or Chinese painting, once it becomes vulgar and low-level, it's hopeless. I hope everyone will unite, learn from each other, and encourage each other, so that the future of Chinese art will be brilliant and shine in the world of art!

"Where is Chinese art going?"

### Read Ten Thousand Books and Travel Ten Thousand Miles

— Xiong Foxi

To answer this question, we should first ask where are Chinese artists going? My answer is an old saying: "Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles." To put it more concretely, artists in the future should, on the one hand, accept the legacy of Chinese and Western art, and on the other hand, go into the masses and learn from the people.

### Spring and Autumn Blames the Wise: Awareness, Repentance, Effort

— Chen Shiwen

Chinese art has already entered a state of decline. The reasons are very complicated: war, politics, economics, the times, and the environment all have a great relationship. There are also a few points that are overlooked, which are listed below:

(1) There are many people who work, but few who understand. They work for a long time, even until death, and still don't know if the path they are taking is correct.

(2) Workers are often limited to a certain time and place, limited to a province or a country, or confined to one person or one school. They do not have the understanding and ability to be inclusive and comprehensive, to learn from the past and present, and from the East and West.

(3) The work is either too sloppy or too immature.

(4) Catering to low-level tastes.

(5) On the streets, in living rooms, in exhibitions, in newspapers and magazines, and even in institutions and schools, almost all of them are works of the calendar girl type.

(6) Reputable writers create forgeries without shame.

(7) Selling fake paintings is not a crime.

(8) Only Chinese artworks go to foreign countries to exchange for money, and no artworks come to China for everyone to view and study.

(9) The preservation of antiquities is not thorough and careful.

(10) The construction of art museums cannot be launched.

(11) The government does not care about art.

(12) Art criticism has become a flattering eight-legged essay, a bunch of cliches.

The above are a few points that I thought of at the moment. The author is writing in the spirit of Spring and Autumn blaming the wise, and only hopes that readers will examine themselves, hoping to immediately become aware, repent, and strive forward on a new path. Then Chinese art will have a new life, and Chinese art can be revived. Moreover, the world art center can also be transferred to the East.

### Always "Imitating"?

— Tan Jinlan

In France, I visited the studios of many famous writers and realized that they were all desperately burying themselves in the study of Chinese art, wanting to find vitamins from it to nourish some of the elements they lacked. That spirit made me feel ashamed and uneasy.

They used everything they learned in their own works - such as Matisse, Geoffroy, and Despiau. But they didn't call it Chinese painting or Chinese sculpture.

But what about us?

Imitating Song, imitating Yuan, imitating Shitao, imitating Siwang, even imitating Matisse, imitating Picasso... The more you imitate, the more proud you are, the more you can be called a great master, the more successful you are. Just like Chinese politics, yesterday we imitated Germany and Italy, today we imitate Britain and the United States, tomorrow we imitate XX. You imitate, I imitate, imitate, imitate, imitate. What kind of art will Chinese art become in the future? Who can answer me?

### Walk Your Own Path

— Shen Yan

During the learning period, follow the teacher. After leaving school, follow the world's famous writers. When you get tired of walking, stop and quietly observe the universe and observe all things - take the true and the beautiful into the picture; put the false and the ugly behind you.

The world is big, the region is wide, and many fertile areas are waiting for us to reclaim.

Especially in the endless sea of art, you can drive freely, without having to follow the waves, and like Columbus, there will always be unexpected new continents to discover. As long as you have perseverance and determination, walk your own path, don't walk the path that others have taken.

### The Boat of Luoxi

— Yu Jianhua

Mount Tiantai is large and the scenery is scattered, and travelers often suffer from insufficient physical strength. Liu Ruanxian left, and the Taoyuan Grotto has long been covered by clouds and fog, and cannot be recognized. The sunset glow of Chicheng is also just an empty name. Only the Luoxi River on Gaoming Temple is clear and playful. A peak stands tall, surrounded by streams, with withered vines hanging down, hence the name "Fishing Boat".

### Popularize Art, Art for the Masses

— Shi Chongpeng

Chinese art is too aristocratic, and the masses do not have the financial resources to enjoy it; Chinese art is too subtle, and the masses do not have the intelligence to appreciate it. Therefore, the slogan of popularizing art has been chanted for a long time. It seems that we want to lower the eternal standard of Chinese art to suit the masses, which is like cutting off your feet to wear shoes. Because Chinese art is more profound than the art of any other country, and its moving and aesthetic power is very great! The only wonderful thing is that it is "beyond the image and gets its essence." If Chinese art is created in a rough and shoddy manner, cultivating low-level tastes, then it will lose the true value of Chinese art and lose its subtle effect of cultivating and influencing.

Therefore, Chinese art should be popularized to the masses of society. The slogan of "popularizing art" should be changed to "art for the masses." The masses do not have the financial resources to enjoy Chinese art. We only need to eliminate internal and external troubles, stabilize society, increase the production power of the masses of society, and improve the economic foundation of the masses of society. Then, when we have enough food and clothing, we will know etiquette and righteousness, and when we know etiquette and righteousness, we will love art! As for the masses not having the intelligence to appreciate it, after the lives of the masses of society are stable, we should first popularize general and complete education (complete education must have the cultivation of art education), and then infuse art knowledge from various aspects. The government should regularly set up various art institutions, gradually promote, advocate, and study, so that the masses can pursue profound art, and do not lower the level of art to suit low-level people.

### Establish Objective Criticism

— Zhao Qingge

The contemporary art world has a major shortcoming, which is that there are only artists and no critics; therefore, black and white are confused, and right and wrong are completely absent.

Most artists only seek skills and neglect theory. The resulting works are light in weight and quality, reflecting empty, superficial, and low-level consciousness. They cannot achieve the level that art should have, let alone progress!

If this continues, Chinese art will decline, unable to get rid of the old, unable to keep up with the new, and will never be able to hold its head up in the face of the world of art.

If we want to reverse this crisis, we can only first establish criticism, objective and faithful criticism, as I say.

### Art is Education

— Ye Zi

Do not go into the wrong path of low-level tastes. Art should reflect reality and influence the masses of the people's education.

### Walk Slowly

— Jian Hua

All sciences can be "one family in the world" and "universal harmony", and do not need to have nationality; all material civilization and enjoyment can also be "treated equally" and "without distinction". Only literature and art seem to have to have some nationality.

Now we won't talk about literature, let's just talk about art? A country's art has its own path to take, and in the middle, it is inevitable that it will often follow foreigners, but halfway through, it often turns back and returns to its own path. For example, in Chinese painting, during the Six Dynasties, influenced by Buddhism, painters used Indian dyeing methods when painting Buddhist paintings. (Zhang Sengyou painted a one-story temple with concave and convex flowers) But soon this method was no longer used. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, when Matteo Ricci brought Western paintings to China, some painters also "abandoned the old and followed the new" and used Western methods, but their lives were not long. Even Matteo Ricci himself could not help but adapt to Chinese painting methods and paint a kind of Sino-Western mixed painting. As for modern examples, it is even more evident. How many people who studied in Europe and specialized in Western painting still paint pictures after returning to China. Even Japan, which is generally recognized as not having its own art and is the most skilled at imitating, but no matter what kind of "Southern Variation" the Japanese compete in, or what kind of "European Painting" Hamu paints, that Japanese flavor is recognizable no matter what.

Nowadays, it can be said that there are only two major schools of art in the world, the Western school, represented by France, Britain, Germany, and Italy, and the Eastern school, represented by China. These two schools of art seem to be "wandering in a fork in the road" and "not knowing what to do". But the situation is not the same. Eastern art has entered an ivory tower, and Western art has walked out onto the street. Eastern art is "frowning" and "crestfallen" and walking slowly; Western art is "rushing around" and "reckless" and driving a speeding jeep. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Do you want to ask the jeep to walk with us? Or do you want to ask us to race with the jeep?

I think it's better to "walk slowly" and take our own way, rather than follow the jeep and cause trouble.

### Weight and Quality

— Song Shouchang

I am a music worker, so let's talk about music: Chinese music has gradually been recognized by the general public after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and it is showing a vigorous atmosphere. Now it has entered the stage of national construction. At present, when there is a large shortage of music teachers, quality is certainly important for future music, but quantity is actually more urgent than quality. I hope that all music colleges and art colleges with music departments and general normal schools will pay attention to this point, so that the art of music, which is most closely related to life, can be more popular!

### Musical Quotations

— Zhong Qi

There is nothing else in the world—even a letter from home is no exception—that excites a soldier's spirit like a good march. (Major Gen. Leonard Wood)

Music is the noblest pleasure in the world. (Dr. F-rank Crane)

### Walk Towards the Road of Revival

— Guan Zilan

Where is Chinese art going?

Go to the road of revival, go to the road of light;

Go to the road of peace and happiness for mankind!

An artist is a person, a person needed by society, a person in Chinese society. He needs to live in society, he needs reality and the evaluation that reality gives him.

A work needs at least humanity, sociality, and nationality, and then it will not lose its universality.

### Establish New Theories and Create New Forms

— Liu Shi

I believe that if we want Chinese painting to progress, we must first eliminate the seemingly familiar name "Western painting." Integrate national painting and so-called "Western painting," abandon their shortcomings, and take their strengths. In terms of content and appearance, we should get rid of the bad habits of "imitating the ancients," "imitating the present," "conservatism," and "inheritance." Jointly establish new theories and create new forms. If we do so, we can leap to a new realm and produce brand-new works with the spirit of the times.

Otherwise, "sailing against the current, if you don't advance, you will retreat." - National painters will forever become antique dealers, and "Western" painters will be merchants of foreign goods for life.

### Cooperation and Death

— Ye Lin

Darwin's principle of "natural selection, survival of the fittest" has established an unshakable position in academia, and has always been regarded as a brilliant view in production science and the principle of biological evolution. Unfortunately, in the past or now, this biological law has always been applied to sociology, so that the inequality of human groups, the existence of the wise and the foolish, the rich and the poor, and the contradiction between satiety and hunger, have also become in line with the evolution of nature and are phenomena that should exist. Only in this way can society evolve and progress. This erroneous view has been criticized by scholars. Because under the theory of evolution, it is believed that the poor and hungry people in society are the weak and should be eliminated, and that the rich and well-fed people are the strong and should be above the weak. Such a deduction affirms the reality of society, affirms the unreasonable phenomena in reality, and hinders mankind from seeking the ideal of equality and happiness.

As Hegel said, everything that exists is reasonable, which helped Hitler, and the application of the theory of evolution to social development also became the essence of the Nazi German-defined racial theory. Therefore, the German nation wants to rule the world and conquer the world, because they are the "most excellent" nation.

Therefore, prescient sociologists have not given up their efforts to refute this erroneous application, which may be the achievement of this war. Recently, Reuters reported that Professor Airy of the University of Chicago has established a new theory, modifying Darwin's theory of evolution, believing that animals are more naturally engaged in cooperation than in anti-social behavior, and that the lives of animals (including humans) are actually governed by a rule - that is, "cooperation and death." It is a natural trend for mankind to move towards goodness in personal, social, national, and international aspects, just as people tend towards wisdom.

Reuters' introduction to Airy's theory is very simple, but he has put forward the most important point, that is, non-cooperative organisms in biological phenomena will always perish. This gives us a new concept after reading Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid", regardless of whether it can overturn Darwin's position in biology. It is only from the point of view of social development that this is a correct view of social evolution. Especially when the differentiation of people has become a serious social phenomenon, the relationship between people has become a new topic that sociology should deeply seek, and when international disputes are unfolding, we feel more and more that cooperation means coexistence, and non-cooperation means death. Therefore, Airy's research results are more worthy of our attention and support.

### The Landlord's Face

— Alin

The rapid increase in the urban population and the failure of urban areas to develop upwards and forwards have caused a serious housing shortage. Although unemployment and high prices have forced some citizens to leave, the unsettled security in various places has brought in many pensioners, which has offset the population that has left. Therefore, the biggest worry for every citizen today, besides the problem of employment, is housing. Today, I don't know how many people are feeling the threat of homelessness under the pressure of being forced to move by landlords, and I don't know how many people are not at peace for a day because they are borrowing and living in the east and west. This is partly due to the housing shortage, and partly due to artificial reasons, that is, the landlord's greed for ill-gotten gains.

We know that high deposits and low rents are a common phenomenon at present. Landowners rely on rental income to satisfy their desires, relying entirely on high deposit fees. Calculated as dark interest income, this deposit is a very considerable figure. But the problem lies here. Ninety percent of the houses in the city are in a state of "long-term residence." Big landlords or second landlords cannot collect deposit fees from them, so the last resort is to force them to leave or increase the rent.

As a result, housing disputes have become serious.

At present. The third tenant who is neither a big landlord nor a second landlord is the most distressed. The landlord is like a creditor, and this mean and fierce face always leaves the second tenants with lingering fears. In recent months, the courts have been crowded with housing lawsuits, which is still a direct dispute between the owner and the tenant. The most serious problem is the oppression of middle and lower-class citizens by second landlords. Not long ago, there was a tragedy in which a second landlord stabbed a tenant to death because he was forced to move. Worse, as in the case of the second landlord on Yanping Road who forced the tenant to leave and planned to "sit and eat," it was even more abnormal.

Now, in addition to directly increasing the rent, there are also disguised methods of increasing the rent, that is, paying the rent according to the declared goods (rice). One landlord asked a civil servant tenant to pay six dou of white rice for rent every month. The civil servant found it difficult, and the landlord questioned him, didn't the government issue eight dou of allocated rice every month? He didn't know that the civil servant's family didn't have enough to eat with these eight dou. This incident vividly depicts the face of a landlord.

Regarding this burgeoning rent dispute, the municipal government has asked the municipal council to formulate a plan to make reasonable adjustments, but the result is that the bill has been retained and there is still no solution. Of course, we do not believe that this shows the power of landowners, but we feel that this is a problem that the citizens of Shanghai are most afraid of, just like food. We should face reality and provide relief. Otherwise, the frequent disputes in the near future will lead to bloody tragedies, which will affect social stability.

### Granting Land to Soldiers

— Xie Tao

The wind and rain all day, sitting idly at the desk is boring, flipping through newspapers and magazines, and in the "Life Daily" I saw that the United States government has a lottery-like preferential method for retired soldiers to grant land to seven retired generals. Originally, between California and Oregon, there was a Tule Lake, which gradually dried up and exposed a large amount of land. During the war, the US government used the labor of Japanese people who were concentrated and detained to engage in reclamation, opening up 86 farms of varying sizes from 61 acres to 140 acres. After the victory, in order to treat retired soldiers preferentially and use this pressed mature land, the government announced that retired soldiers would publicly draw lots to decide, and the winners would receive a farm, but limited to those with more than two years of agricultural experience and possessing 2,000 yuan in cash (this is used for the cost of building houses and cultivating land), and declared that applicants must have honest, thrifty, abstinent, and hardworking personalities. I often see a photo published, a young couple who won the lottery leaning against each other on a small hill, looking down at a vast plain below, pointing and planning where to build their new home, full of light and hope.

We have fertile land that stretches for thousands of miles. Why can't we allocate it to our demobilized soldiers?

### Peach Blossom Fan

— Ma Gao

This is a story that has been circulating for quite some time, and there have been several different adaptations of it. Even for the same author, there are two versions: the Gui opera and the Sichuan dialect drama being performed this time. However, in this new adaptation, we can clearly see that the author has infused new blood into the old story of a scholar meeting a courtesan while seeking refuge from disaster. He intricately weaves Li Xiangjun's poignant tragedy with the deep context of her era, exposing the political decay of the late Ming Dynasty, the arrogance and tyranny of treacherous and powerful officials, their deceiving superiors and oppressing the people, and their shameless acts of losing integrity and falling into disgrace. At the same time, he sings the praises of the unyielding spirit of the people, the righteous and chaste Li Xiangjun, and even lashes out at the unprincipled Hou Fangyu and the two-faced Yang Wencong.

However, we regret that the author's writing is too scattered, diverting the audience's attention with minor details. If he could have focused more on the central events surrounding Hou Fangyu and Li Xiangjun, giving them more room to develop, especially Hou Fangyu's "betrayal," if the facts could have been concretely presented, and his contradictory words and actions could be placed in stark contrast, then Li Xiangjun's suffering would feel even more unjust. Similarly, in terms of directing techniques, there are even many places that feel trivial. I think the reason for this is that the playwright and director are the same person, and he unintentionally emphasized his personal preferences, allowing secondary elements to occupy the primary position, thus weakening the climax.

Of course, there are many successful aspects of the direction. His subtlety, meticulousness, spatial arrangement, and atmosphere changes prove him to be a veteran of the stage.

Ling Ruosuo, who plays Li Xiangjun, gives the most energetic performance, achieving excellent results. I have seen her in several plays in Chongqing and Kunming, but this is her most successful performance. Especially in the several scenes where she is the main focus, she performs with ease and avoids artificial gestures, striving to reveal her inner psychology, which is truly commendable and valuable. Gao Bo's Hou Fangyu fails to convey the talent and literary talent of the character, and also fails to show the despicable side of the role. The character of Yang Wencong is a flaw in the author's writing. The character's personality is incomplete, and his changes and duality have too many sharp edges. However, Fei Ke's performance makes him exceptionally satisfactory; he has chosen a suitable appearance for the role. The actor who plays Ruan Sheng is good, portraying the face of a sycophantic and overbearing petty person quite thoroughly.

The stage design seems too hasty, failing to contribute to the desired effect of the script and even undermining the poetic prose feel of the play in some parts.

### Arts and Literature

The Shanghai Experimental Film Studio will broadcast precious music this afternoon (15th) at 8:00 PM at the China Free Radio (Station 20). Famous musicians will personally perform and sing tunes with rich Chinese flavor. The program includes "Mountains in a Vague Mist" (female three-part chorus), "A Taoist Song" (ancient tune, male and female chorus), "Plum Blossom Dream" (female chorus), "Nostalgic Song" (male solo), "Must Accompany" (Northern folk song, female chorus), and Erhu and Kunpa solos, totaling twenty songs, all accompanied by symphonic music. In addition to various Chinese and Western musicians, the studio's stars, Wang Renmei and Sha Li, will also participate in the performance.

André Gide's "Return of the Prodigal Son," translated by Bian Zhilin; Leo Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyich," translated by Fang Jing; Edith Wharton's "Ethan Frome," translated by Lü Shuxiang; Ivan Goncharov's "The Precipice," translated by Li Lin; and Mao Mei's "Peach Garden" have all been published by the Culture and Life Publishing House.

The second issue of "Asian Century," edited by Fang Qiuwei, has been published. It contains articles such as Geng Danru's "The Korean Question and US-Soviet Relations," Meng Xianzhang's "A Temporary Bomb in Asia," Chu Yukun's "The Core Issue of Concluding a Peace Treaty with Japan," Zhao Nanrou's "The Current Japanese Political Situation," and Zhao Qingge's "Fire and Calamity," with substantial content.

After arriving in Hangzhou, He Jiahuan went to Taoguang Temple to inquire about accommodation, but because it was "full," he has moved to Tianzhu to reside.

The "Xue Feng" semi-monthly magazine, organized by Lü Simian and others, in addition to publishing periodicals on schedule, is currently drafting plans to publish a series of books. It is reported that the books are divided into two categories: one is purely literary, and the other is academic.

Fan Quan recently completed a novella of about 30,000 words, "Happiness," which depicts life on an island, but its content reflects the current turbulent social and political situation. This novella will first be serialized in the "Little Friend" weekly published by the Zhonghua Book Company.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Fortunately, after not much effort, most of the twenty or thirty troupe members scattered in various vehicles had been found. After three or four troupe members who had some medical knowledge examined Feifei's symptoms, everyone said that it might be typhus or possibly meningitis.

"Then, who has aspirin? Please bring it out quickly!" Old Zhu asked anxiously.

"No, Old Zhu, I have Daychienphon!" someone quickly replied. "If it's meningitis, Daychienphon is better than aspirin."

Old Zhu also felt that Feifei's illness was closer to meningitis because she complained of a headache as soon as she fell ill.

"Good! Quick! Quick!"

This person hurriedly pulled down the travel bag he was carrying and frantically searched inside, finally finding a glass tube, but when he took it out, there were only two pills left inside.

Zhu Zhaonian clumsily forced Feifei to swallow one pill first.

"Two pills are not enough, Old Zhu. Alas! Let's think of another way!" Lu Qian, who had been standing beside him watching for a while without saying anything, couldn't help but sigh again.

Old Zhu raised his head and looked at everyone's faces for a long time before finally deciding on an idea.

"Everyone, you have all witnessed what has happened in the past two days!" he said emotionally. "I am now very anxious about her condition. According to this child's condition, I must take her on the road immediately. Whether by car, boat, horse, or even on foot, I must quickly get her to Nandan, where there may still be a hospital. Children's illnesses are simple, and early treatment is always better. However, I have to part ways with you all! You may say that I am too selfish, too irresponsible, or even scold me, hate me, or even never cooperate with me again, but I can only let you do as you please..." Several people wanted to interrupt to express that they did not mean that. But Old Zhu immediately waved his hand to stop them. "I am taking Mrs. Hu and her daughter with me. Mrs. Hu herself knows how to treat typhus, but if she stays in Hechi, I don't know when she will recover, and this child has fallen ill. If I don't take care of her, I really can't live with my conscience. Fortunately, we can't perform anymore, and the money is all spent. It's no different from being with the common people. It doesn't matter much to the troupe whether I am there or not. So, I have decided to take this child away first, please forgive me!"
