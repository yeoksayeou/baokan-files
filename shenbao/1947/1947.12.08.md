### The Center of the Southern Henan Battle Shifts Westward; Part of the Bandits Sneaks Across the Pinghan Railway and is Surrounded; Nationalist Forces Advance Rapidly, Directly Approaching Luoshan

[Special Dispatch from Jiujiang, 7th] Fierce battles are taking place today in the area east of the Luoshan-Xuanhuadian Highway and the Pinghan Railway in southern Henan. The main force of Liu's First Column and about two brigades of the Twelfth Column are fiercely attacking westward. Their vanguard, about 4,000 bandits, secretly crossed the Pinghan Railway south of Xinyang at Liulin Station at dawn on the 7th and fled westward. They are now surrounded and attacked by Nationalist forces in Tanhe Town, not far from the railway, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them. The bandits in Songbu, Macheng, are now being attacked by Nationalist forces and have suffered heavy losses. Yesterday, the bandits set fire in Macheng and Songbu. When our air force scouted over the area in the afternoon, they still saw raging fires.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Hankou, 7th] Provincial Senator Duan Xisan stated at a tea party hosted by Minister Bai that the situation in northern Hubei is also critical, with part of the bandit army crossing the Han River and reaching Yunxi.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Hankou, 7th] The Nationalist forces that captured Luotian are taking advantage of the victory to advance towards Songbu and Macheng. In one fell swoop, they drove the bandits from the Yinjia River area northwest of Songbu towards the northwest, and are still pursuing and suppressing them. In addition, the First Column of bandits that fled to Yuwangcheng is now attempting to cross the road west of Liulin Station. Nationalist forces are intercepting them.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Jiujiang, 6th] The main forces of Liu's First, Second, and Tenth Columns are invading southward on the Xinyang-Huangchuan Highway. Over the past three days, they have been moving southwest under the combined attack of Nationalist forces from the north and south. The focus of the battle has gradually shifted from the highway to intercepting the railway line. The main force of the First Column and part of the Tenth Column crossed Luoshan southeast of Zhou Dangfan on the 6th and fled west along the Xuanhuadian Highway. They are now in the Yangjia Dian and Wanjia Dian area, about 40 kilometers south of Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway line. Nationalist forces are attacking from both the front and the rear. Based on the front-line battle reports and bandit situation assessments of the past three days, Liu's bandits, under pressure in the Dabie Mountains, cannot realize their delusional dream of establishing a base there. They are now determined to concentrate their main forces and risk a westward offensive, attempting to secretly cross the Pinghan Railway south of Xinyang and north of Jigong Mountain to peer into the Tongbai Mountains and join forces with Chen Geng and Li Xiannian, who are entrenched in Nanzhao and Neixiang. In addition, Liu's Third Column, originally based in the area between Macheng and Luotian, is coordinating with Liu's main force in the operation.

The upper left corner of the leaflet is printed with the words "Hand in this leaflet to surrender, the Nationalist army will provide reception and protection." Bai also published a "Letter to the People in the Areas Infested by Communist Bandits," admonishing the people in the bandit areas to take the Nanyang People's Corps in southern Henan, which helped the Nationalist army defeat the Communist bandits, as an example, hoping that the people in the bandit areas will quickly cooperate with the Nationalist army, defend their homes, and eliminate the Communist bandits so that they can live in peace. These two types of leaflets will be distributed by airplanes in the battlefields and areas infested by bandit armies.

Minister Bai then delivered an impromptu speech, emphasizing the importance of the people's self-defense forces, saying that today's suppression of bandits cannot rely solely on field armies to capture points and lines; it is necessary to mobilize the people and destroy the underground organizations of the Communist bandits in order to achieve overall control. Bai then announced the central government's decisions on organizing and training the people: (A) Local self-defense forces are allowed to be privately owned by the counties and townships, and the Nationalist army is prohibited from incorporating or conscripting them. (B) The expenses of the self-defense forces of each county must also be approved by the council, and each is allowed to raise funds locally.

### Hong Lan You Discusses Preparatory Work; National Assembly to be Convened Within a Month; December 25th is the Beginning of Constitutional Rule

[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, stated on the evening of the 7th that the National Assembly's preparatory work is actively underway. When a reporter inquired about the date of the National Assembly, Hong stated that December 25th is truly a landmark day. Before that, it was the period of political tutelage, and from then on, constitutional rule will begin. The 25th is not the day the Constitutional National Assembly will be convened, but constitutional rule has already begun, so the session may not exceed one month. According to Hong's observation, the biggest task in this meeting will be the election of the president and vice president. The constitution has not yet been implemented, so there is probably no need to amend it, but there is no explicit provision that it cannot be amended, so it is not yet known whether a constitutional amendment will be proposed at this meeting. However, based on speculation, the duration of the conference may be ten days. Hong also stated that the preparatory work for this conference will particularly focus on cost savings.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] News on Election Results: The results of the National Assembly election have been reported to the Election Headquarters by more than 600 units.

### Kuomintang Decides to Concede Individual Legislator Candidate Quotas; Central Standing Committee Supports Allied Parties in the Election

[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held a temporary meeting on the 7th to discuss the list of legislator candidates from the Democratic and Youth parties. The three principles decided by the small group meeting on the 6th were approved, and Kuomintang members would make further concessions and do their best to support the election of allied parties, and they were immediately handed over to the small group meeting for discussion and coordination of the list.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Since the Kuomintang Central 14-member committee decided on the principle of legislator self-nomination election in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, the reactions of people from the Democratic and Youth parties here are slightly different. A spokesman for the Youth Party said that in principle, they do not object, but the method is worth discussing. They do not know whether the free election means that the Kuomintang does not support the legislator candidates of the two parties in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, or whether it means that they fundamentally abandon the principle of party nomination. We do not agree with the latter, because party nomination does not hinder free election. The Youth Party's candidates for the Beijing and Shanghai areas have not yet been determined, because Beijing and Shanghai are areas where talents gather, so those who are produced in the future must be well-known figures. The current problem is that those who are qualified in terms of qualifications and prestige are unwilling to serve as candidates, and most of those who are willing to be candidates have problems in terms of qualifications and prestige, so a final decision has not yet been made. A senior official of the Democratic Socialist Party stated: Free election is a question of content, not a dispute over principles. If there can truly be free competition under fair conditions, this party will naturally have no objection. However, if one party occupies special advantages and conveniences and controls the grassroots organizations of various districts and baojia, then it should be discussed separately.

### Appointed Senators from Two Parties; Report After Receiving Notification

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] People from the Democratic and Youth parties here have stated that although the list of appointed senators has been announced, they have not yet received written notification, presumably because the official procedures are time-consuming. Once they receive it, they will immediately report to the local Senate. Regarding the election of supervisors, representatives of the three parties in Nanjing are negotiating, and there are no concrete results yet.

### Hunan Kuomintang Supervisory Committee Member Li Ruxian Commits Suicide Due to Illness

The Naval Headquarters has also scheduled a signing ceremony and a wine party after the signing ceremony on the 8th to celebrate the occasion.

### Ye Gongchao Issues a Statement Reaffirming Our Position on Convening a Preparatory Meeting for the Peace Conference

[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao declared on the 7th: Regarding the convening of a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, the Chinese government notified the relevant countries with recommendations on November 17. After the Chinese government received the Soviet government's reply on this recommendation on the 27th of the same month, it again sent a note to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on the 5th, reaffirming our country's position, advocating that the organization of the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan and its voting procedures should follow the precedents of the Far Eastern Commission. The Chinese government stated in its reply that the task of the Far Eastern Commission has been clearly defined as deciding on all policies related to Japan's fulfillment of its obligations under the terms of surrender, and its importance is no less than that of the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan. The Chinese government believes that, whether in terms of organizational principles or voting procedures, the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan should not deviate from the principles adopted by the Far Eastern Commission, which has been unanimously approved by the eleven member states. Such deviations will only delay the convening of the aforementioned preparatory meeting. Regarding the Soviet government's suggestion to convene a preparatory meeting in China in January 1948, if the relevant countries agree, the Chinese government is willing to accept it. However, if the relevant countries cannot agree, the Chinese government has no intention of changing its original suggestion to hold this meeting in Washington.

### Japanese Foreign Ministry Drafts Secret Memorandum; Plans to Conclude a "Negotiated" Peace Treaty

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] World News Weekly said today: Japan is trying to conclude a "negotiated" peace treaty and avoid accepting a treaty based on unconditional surrender that is completely decided by the Allied countries. The weekly disclosed the full text of a secret memorandum drafted by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, which was secretly obtained from Tokyo. The memorandum reveals Tokyo's strategy for the peace conference, stating that Habomai Island and Shikotan Island, which are part of the territory of the base, should still be Japanese territory. It is also hoped that Japanese residents in Taiwan and Penghu will have the freedom to choose their nationality. According to the plan in the memorandum, Taiwanese people in Japan will acquire Chinese nationality, but compensation for the loss of Allied people's property will not be claimed from these Taiwanese people after they acquire Chinese nationality. According to this plan, since Japan's surrender, various instructions issued to the Japanese government by MacArthur, one million tons, and can own airplanes. World News Weekly analyzed the memorandum and pointed out that other Pacific islands that Japan wants to retain include the Kuril Islands, Ryukyu, Ogasawara, and Iwo Jima. It also said: None of the islands it wants to retain were obtained through aggression. Japanese newspapers have followed the Japanese government's instructions and launched a propaganda campaign to find sufficient reasons in advance for Japan's demands in the peace conference in the future. Japan will try to alienate the United States and the Soviet Union, so that they are opposed to each other, so that it can conclude more lenient treaties with the two countries.

### Major Issues of the China Changchun Railway; We Will Negotiate with the Soviet Side Immediately; Zou Shangyou Flies to Shenyang to Take Office Within Days

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Zou Shangyou, the newly appointed Assistant Director of the China Changchun Railway, is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shanghai within days and fly to Shenyang to take office. This adjustment of personnel in this railway is of great significance, because regarding important issues such as the asset management of this railway, although our side has repeatedly notified the Soviet government to send personnel to Nanjing to discuss solutions, the Soviet personnel have not yet been assigned, so some major issues of the China Changchun Railway remain unresolved. This adjustment of senior personnel in this railway can be regarded as our government's preparation to start negotiations with the Soviet side at any time. From this, it can also be proved that our government has always faithfully fulfilled the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Zou is one of China's senior diplomats and has served in the diplomatic field for more than 20 years, and has repeatedly represented China in handling diplomatic affairs with the Soviet Union, so he has extremely rich experience in handling diplomacy with the Soviet Union.

### British Ambassador in Hong Kong; Will Assist in Resolving the Kowloon Issue

[This Newspaper's Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Guo Dehua, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi, recently came to Nanjing to report on his work. In addition to making requests regarding routine matters, he also reported on the incident of the Hong Kong government ordering Chinese residents in the old city of Kowloon to relocate and demolish their houses. According to him on the 7th: Our country has not abandoned its sovereignty over the old city of Kowloon, and will continue to fulfill its responsibility to protect the safety of life of the residents in the city. However, this matter is not very military. British Ambassador Stevenson happened to be inspecting overseas Chinese affairs along the Chinese coast at this time and traveled to Hong Kong, which can help resolve the issue.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th] Since the afternoon of the 6th, the situation in Kowloon City has been extremely tense, because the Hong Kong police have dispatched many plainclothes detectives outside the old city in an attempt to prevent reporters from contacting the residents of Kowloon City.

### Allied Countries Should Deeply Recognize the Significance of Our All-Out Effort to Suppress the Rebellion; Wu Tiecheng Issues a Statement on the Anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Incident

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The 8th is the sixth anniversary of the Pearl Harbor Incident. Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, issued a statement to the Central News Agency on his thoughts on the Pearl Harbor Incident. Because Wu went to Honolulu after the failure of the Second Revolution in 1914 and went to Pearl Harbor, his feelings about the place are particularly profound. Wu said: We are full of indignation about the attack on Pearl Harbor by the common enemy of the Allied countries, this kind of undeclared war, which is similar to the behavior of barbaric nations in the Middle Ages. Even though six years have passed, not only has our sense of indignation not diminished, but in today's increasingly complex and dangerous international situation, it is even more likely to arouse our greatest vigilance. Gang said: China does not want to see wars in the world again. Under any difficult circumstances, regardless of whether there is foreign aid or how much foreign aid there is, it will definitely do its best to put its own house in order, that is, to quell the rebellion of the Communist Party, so as to prevent the September 18th Incident from happening again in the Far East. However, we cannot help but regret that China's efforts to eradicate the main force of the Communist Party in the Far East have not yet been widely and deeply recognized by the friendly countries. (Continued on column 1 of page 2)

It was decided to push Yu Hongjun, Zhang Jia'ao, and Xu Kan to formulate measures and submit them to the next meeting for discussion.

### Current Financial and Economic Problems: The Government Seeks a Comprehensive Solution; US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Hopper, Praises Recent Economic Measures and Hopes China Will Adopt a Realistic Foreign Exchange Policy

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 7th] The government is urgently seeking a proper and comprehensive solution to the current national financial and economic problems. In addition to the establishment of Financial Management Bureaus by the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai and Wuhan to stabilize the financial market and curb speculative and illegal activities, and the reorganization of the Textile Adjustment Committee into the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs to achieve comprehensive control of cotton yarn and cloth, the Executive Yuan, led by President Zhang Qun, is consulting with the heads of various ministries and commissions to adopt further control measures. It is learned that the extraordinary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 6th was the beginning of this important task, with the focus on "how to seek foreign aid and how to rely on self-reliance." At the meeting, the heads of various ministries expressed their opinions on their respective businesses, especially those they felt were difficult to address. The above points were then discussed, focusing on how we should gain international trust in order to obtain the necessary foreign aid. Regarding the latter, everyone agreed that we should consider how to survive in the absence of external aid, and therefore constantly seek ways to rely on self-reliance. The opinions expressed by various parties at the meeting will be compiled by President Zhang Qun into a comprehensive plan to solve the overall financial and economic problems. This meeting will continue to be convened. It was also mentioned at the meeting that the issue of currency reform was still considered premature by the majority.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 7th] A prominent figure said on the evening of the 7th that regarding the issue of commodity controls, the government's initial control of gold and foreign exchange and the tightening of credit have moved from passive controls to active solutions. This person believes that if the tightening of credit continues, commodity prices will inevitably fall. He also expressed approval for the government's cotton yarn and cloth control measures, especially the principles of entrusted spinning and weaving, which have achieved comprehensive control. In the past, the price of yarn was restricted, but the evaluation of cotton and cloth was not controlled. Now, through entrusted spinning, weaving, unified purchasing, and unified sales, the effect of comprehensive control can be achieved.

[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Hopper, stated that it is very easy for China to absorb US$500 million worth of American production equipment for reconstruction purposes. However, Chinese and American politicians have not yet been able to resolve how to repay this import. Mr. Hopper, who left Shanghai in July of this year to hold discussions with businessmen interested in trade with China, believes that the slow pace of China's post-war reconstruction is due to internal turmoil, inflation, and insufficient transportation. He stated that the many economic measures recently taken by the Chinese government are sound and are "signs of hope," one of which is the revision of foreign exchange regulations and the supply of foreign exchange at market prices. This indicates that the Chinese government has adopted a "wise" policy to encourage domestic economic construction. However, the Chinese government must adopt a realistic foreign exchange policy because the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate is too large. In his conversations with businessmen in various American cities, Mr. Hopper found that many of them are very interested in the possibility of imports and exports in the near future. Mr. Hopper advocated that if American businessmen want to ensure their future in exports to East Asia, they must "have a greater import mentality."

Editorial

### On the Issue of the Undemarcated Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border

With assurances of independence, Burma is preparing to take over British Burmese territory on January 4th next year. Burma is a good neighbor of our country, and public opinion is congratulating Burma on its independence. We also look forward to the future Sino-Burmese relations becoming better and more pleasant. However, a rather unpleasant incident has occurred between China and Burma, caused by misunderstandings arising from the Burmese government's statement on the issue of the undemarcated section of the Burma-Yunnan border. First, Mr. Zhou Kun, Director of the Territorial Affairs Department of our Ministry of Interior, gave a speech to reporters from the Nanjing Central Daily News on November 25th, analyzing the ways to resolve the outstanding issues of China's undemarcated boundaries. Subsequently, a Burmese spokesperson expressed regret over our recovery of Jiangxinpo and other places, even threatening with the words "bloodshed" and "force." In order to explain the misunderstanding, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 2nd of this month, stating that the two countries will certainly be able to seek a legal and satisfactory solution to the issue of the undemarcated section of the Yunnan-Burma border in the spirit of harmony and the provisions of the treaty. Any one-sided statement or action cannot force the other party to consider it valid. The Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not having learned of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement, stated on the 1st that Burma's national borders had already been recorded on official maps and do not need to be referred to the United Nations. The undemarcated sections should be resolved through bilateral agreement, and Burma will never give up any part of its territory. For the Burmese government, in order to ensure their territory, their words are just and righteous. We certainly express our sympathy. However, if this involves the undemarcated Sino-Burmese border, it cannot but cause regret. The statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is fair and clear, and should be cherished by the Burmese government and our people. We are confident that the issue of the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border will not form an unpleasant dispute between China and Burma. We would like to elaborate on this.

China and Burma have close relations. Not only are there glorious records in history, but there is also a relationship of interdependence in geography and position. The area where Yunnan and Burma meet is geographically part of the Yunnan plateau, and the terrain becomes higher the further north one goes. Famous rivers include the Salween River (also known as the Nujiang River or the Salween River), the Lancang River (also known as the Mekong River), and the Jinsha River (also known as the Irrawaddy River). Many tributaries of the three rivers are scattered along the Yunnan-Burma border. This area is indeed rich in produce and has a strategically important terrain, especially the northern section, from Kangzang to Jian'gao Mountain, which is even more important. When Burma was annexed to our country, there was no strict demarcation of the border. After Burma fell to Britain, the issue of the Sino-Burmese border arose. The discussion of the Sino-Burmese border began with the "Sino-British Burma Treaty" in the twelfth year of Guangxu (1886 AD). Later, Xue Fucheng, our minister to Britain, and British Foreign Secretary Lord Salisbury signed the "Sino-British Supplementary Provisions Regarding the Yunnan-Burma Border and Commerce" (the twentieth year of Guangxu, i.e., 1894), and Grand Secretary Li Hongzhang and British Minister Sir Claude MacDonald signed the "Additional Articles to the Sino-British Burma Treaty" (the twenty-third year of Guangxu, i.e., 1897), so that the borderlines between the two sides were stipulated in the treaty. However, regarding the undemarcated section in the north (Kangzang to Jian'gao Mountain section) and the undemarcated section in the south (Nanding River to Nanji River section), because we did not know the actual situation of the border at that time, we were unable to demarcate it. Therefore, it was stipulated in the treaty that special officials should be sent to survey and demarcate it. The inaction and delay of the Qing dynasty's diplomacy led to many disputes on the Yunnan-Burma border in later years.

The Sino-Burmese border is divided into four sections: the first section is from Kangzang to Jian'gao Mountain; the second section is from Jian'gao Mountain to the Nanding River; the third section is from the Nanding River to the Nanban River; and the fourth section is from the Nanban River to Vietnam. Among the above four sections of the border, the second and fourth sections were demarcated during the Guangxu period, and the third section was demarcated on June 18th of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China (1941 AD). However, the first section remains an outstanding issue. This section is located at 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude, that is, north of Jian'gao Mountain in Tengchong, encompassing Jiangxincheng, Yeren Mountain, and the Hukang River Valley, with an area of about 200,000 square kilometers, equivalent to Zhejiang Province. The British army occupied this area for decades, and our country's repeated protests were ineffective. During the Second World War, the Japanese invaded Burma and once penetrated deep into western Yunnan. After the British army withdrew, our guerrilla forces crossed the Gaoligong Mountains and entered Jiangxinpo and other places to carry out meticulous security work. After the war ended, our army withdrew, and the British came again, unfortunately returning to the previous state. Now that Britain has granted Burma independence, this undemarcated section, which in fact was originally Chinese territory, where Chinese administrative agencies were established many times, should be unconditionally returned to China by the British and Burmese, so that the outstanding issue can be resolved and the neighborly friendship between China and Burma can be strengthened. This is not only what the people of our country hope for, but also the common goal that peaceful Far Eastern countries should pursue in today's era. The future of Sino-Burmese relations is vast and boundless. There should be no more border disputes, and threatening words or actions should not be used because of the undemarcated border.

We have placed unlimited hope on Burma's independence. Regarding the Sino-Burmese border demarcation issue, we would like to ask the governments of China and Burma to do three things: First, regarding the resolution of the outstanding issue of the undemarcated section of the Yunnan-Burma border, the two countries should seek diplomatic channels before January next year to break the deadlock in border negotiations. Before the outstanding issue is resolved, any unfriendly action will increase the factors of dispute. We hope that the Burmese government will resume rational management, avoid impatience, and refrain from any emotionally driven behavior. Second, the Ministry of Interior should actively carry out the survey work of the undemarcated line between Yunnan and Burma, legally establish boundary markers according to our geography and orientation, and establish necessary border police to restore security. Third, the issue of the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border does not belong to the scope of internal affairs. Statements by officials can easily cause misunderstandings and only increase diplomatic difficulties. In the future, our country should maintain a cautious attitude. Recalling that in the eleventh year of Guangxu, Zeng Jize made a wrong statement on the Yunnan-Burma border while serving as an envoy to Britain and France, which increased the major difficulties in later negotiations. Zeng cannot escape his responsibility, so statements must be made with caution.

The resolution of the outstanding issue of the undemarcated Yunnan-Burma border will not be difficult to achieve as long as China and Burma establish diplomatic relations and have open and honest discussions. We are confident that the emerging politicians of Burma are rational and farsighted and, in the course of building a new country, will be able to reciprocate the kindness of their good neighbor!

### Wu Tiecheng's Speech

(Continued from page one) When Japan invaded Northeast China on September 18th, Chinese leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek told the world that this was the prelude to the Second World War, but at the time it did not seem to attract the attention of people in the United States and other countries. In order to implement its anti-aggression doctrine, China refused to participate in the Japan-Italian Anti-Comintern Pact, and resisted Japanese aggression alone for as long as four years. Even today, some enlightened people in the United States point out that the Sino-Japanese War was China fighting for the United States in the Far East. When Japan invaded Hainan Island, the Chinese leader again warned the world that this was the prelude to the Pacific War, demanding that the United States stop selling scrap iron and gasoline to Japan and provide China with arms assistance. Although the United States failed to accept China's opinion, China still fulfilled its due responsibility. From 1937 to 1941, China resisted Japan independently. Although the seaports were blockaded and foreign aid was exhausted, the will to resist the enemy was not diminished. Mr. Wu further stated that the current situation of the National Government is almost the same as the experience of September 18th. If the military force of the Chinese Communist Party cannot be defeated, China will become an appendage to international totalitarian politics, and its impact on the peace of the Far East and the world will be threatened. Here, I would like to reiterate what I said earlier: The result of the National Government's efforts over the past twenty years is, first, that China has not been communized; second, that China has not been dominated by Japan. Otherwise, the entire world situation would inevitably be more dangerous than it is today, especially the post-war situation.

### A Journey to Hong Kong
— Special Correspondent Xi Ju

This time, our group of Chinese and foreign journalists, at the invitation of British Airways, was able to revisit Hong Kong after the war. Although the visit was only for three short nights, many impressions surged into our minds, which I can share with readers. The first striking impression, I feel, is that this glittering crown of the British Empire, known as a "six-star" city, when viewed from Kowloon across the sea at night, although still sparkling like a Christmas tree, has lost a significant number of its jewels on the mountaintop. It seems to have faded in color and diminished in glory. This symbolizes everything in Hong Kong today. However, although the crown has faded in color and diminished in glory, it is still a paradise for some people. Before the outbreak of World War II, Hong Kong relied on refugees seeking asylum, creating a distorted boom. In today's postwar era of economic turmoil and political instability, it has become a gold mine for smugglers and a place of refuge or activity for political exiles. At the same time, it remains a haven for Chinese and foreigners seeking high levels of material enjoyment, where they can indulge themselves without dietary restrictions and wear luxurious clothes unavailable elsewhere.

### Empty Houses on the Peak

The buildings in Hong Kong and Kowloon suffered relatively little damage during the war because the Japanese army did not bomb indiscriminately. After the recovery, the British actively repaired them, and by this spring, they had been restored to their former appearance. The destroyed parts that the reporter saw during the war are now almost impossible to find in the urban area. From this, we can see the British ability to rebuild. However, the impression we got when we visited the Peak was completely different. From a distance, the scenery on the mountain is still the same, with Western-style buildings standing majestically amidst the green vegetation. But when we reached the top, we saw that all the houses were dilapidated and empty, without roofs, windows wide open, and deserted ruins. The mountainside used to be a residential area for the British (before the war, higher-ranking Chinese could only live on the mountainside). After the war, Britain suffered deep wounds, and the people lived frugally. Now, the Hong Kong government is still pleading poverty. The number of British people living on the island is far fewer than before, and they are unable to repair the buildings. This time, when the reporter visited Flagstaff Hill, he saw three or four large buildings under construction. As for the mountain roads, they have been completely changed due to destruction by artillery fire, disrepair over the years, and the removal of railings, seats, street lamps, iron pillars, etc., by the Japanese for shipment to Japan. Tourists who visit here are truly filled with mixed emotions. The Hong Kong Island government is now vigorously encouraging residents to build houses and welcoming wealthy Chinese to invest and live on the mountain. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation can provide loans to assist those who can repair these tall buildings, with the aim of restoring the prosperity of the past as soon as possible. This "raising chickens to get eggs" approach has yielded considerable results. In the past, the tram (cable car) to the Peak was crowded with tourists, and business was booming. Now, the carriages are sparsely populated every day, and the company is suffering heavy losses. The British people living on the mountain can now only live in rented houses with ordinary Chinese people, so the "royal" air of the past has been largely eliminated. The way they treat Chinese people is now very different from the past.

### Agreement Signed, Implementation Delayed

Looking at the current style of the Hong Kong government, it is indeed prioritizing the restoration of past prosperity in every way. It is striving for the stability of residents in terms of living standards, and its policies are now much more open-minded than before the war. Chinese newspapers can freely criticize the Hong Kong government. They are hoping to wash away the appearance of colonialism and achieve genuine cooperation with the Chinese people. It is said that they hope to establish a new institution with Chinese participation in politics next year to create a new style of British colonialism in the Far East. This change in policy, although it has a considerable relationship with the previous proposal by Chinese people to recover Hong Kong, is also due to the fact that the political and economic status of Hong Kong itself is closely related to China. If Hong Kong wants to restore its former appearance, it must cooperate with China in a real way. The recent exchanges between Zhang Fakui, Song Ziwen, Hong Kong Governor Grantham, and British Ambassador Stevenson, and the signing of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, are all concrete manifestations of the active efforts of China and Britain to enhance bilateral relations. Although the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement has been formally signed by representatives of both sides and has become a formal international document, the reason for the delay in its implementation is said to be: Hong Kong is an open port without any restrictions. Its prosperity after the war is greatly related to smuggling. If smuggling is cracked down on, smugglers may move to Macau, which would be greatly detrimental to Hong Kong. Once the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement is implemented, it will inevitably establish a fixed exchange rate between the national currency and the Hong Kong dollar. Recently, the Hong Kong dollar has plummeted, and China's currency is experiencing rampant inflation. If an exchange rate is established, not only will the Hong Kong dollar be significantly affected, but also the remittances from overseas Chinese, which are currently centered in Hong Kong, will no longer flow into Hong Kong. Since our country implemented its foreign exchange control policy, the market price of foreign exchange has been adjusted from time to time, but it still cannot keep up with the black market. Therefore, many export goods are smuggled to Hong Kong. However, the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement stipulates that the black market should be cracked down on. Once implemented, the foreign exchange settlement in Shanghai and the foreign exchange settlement in the Maoye area will be about the same. Exporters who used to ship goods to Hong Kong for transshipment will inevitably abandon Hong Kong and choose other ports, which will inevitably cause serious economic losses to Hong Kong. Moreover, Hong Kong was originally a port for the import and export of Chinese goods. The implementation of the new agreement may cause this glittering crown to lose its luster. As a result, its political status will inevitably change accordingly. The British have this inner torment, which is why they are particularly cautious. (Continued on Page Five)

### Four Powers Have Widely Divergent Views on the Future Economic Principles of Germany; Soviet Union Insists on Establishing a Central German Organization First

[Reuters London Sixth Dispatch] The Foreign Ministers' Conference was unable to decide on a way to deal with the third item on the agenda of this session, namely, the economic principles of the future Germany. Finally, Marshall asked Molotov whether he could submit a specific paper on economic principles on Monday. Molotov did not agree, and the meeting was adjourned.

The meeting today was chaired by Marshall. After the meeting began, he first suggested using the British basic document on economic principles as a basis for discussion. However, Molotov wanted to use the two documents that recorded the points on which the four powers had failed to reach an agreement on economic principles at the Moscow Conference as the basis for discussion, which was opposed by the other three foreign ministers. In the documents that Molotov insisted on using as the basis for discussion, there were statements such as "the economic institutions of each region, including one or more occupation zones, should be abolished." If this proposal were adopted, the organization of the Anglo-American Combined Zone would inevitably be abolished. Molotov also submitted three documents today, respectively on the level of German industry, the free exchange of materials in various regions, and the opinion on the establishment of a German Ministry of Economy, but none of them were discussed. Molotov's documents stated: "Free Circulation of Materials Nationwide in Germany": After the establishment of the German central organization and the procedures for Germany to fulfill its reparation obligations are stipulated, inter-regional barriers should be abolished, and the free circulation of materials in the four regions should be allowed. The regional economic institutions including one or more occupation zones should be abolished immediately. "Level of German Industry": The German central organization should draft a plan for the rehabilitation of the German economy within the limits of the new industrial level, but Germany's reparation obligations should be fully fulfilled unconditionally. "Central German Organization": The Control Council recognizes the need to rapidly restore German agriculture, industry, transportation, and raise the living standards of the German people within the scope of maintaining security and preventing the restoration of the German military industry, so that Germany can assist in the recovery of Europe and develop German foreign trade. However, Germany's economic recovery depends on the German people themselves being able to implement appropriate measures nationwide. Therefore, a central economic organization organized entirely by Germans should be established to carry out its tasks under the supervision of the four powers. If the measures of the central German organization violate the instructions of the Allied Control Council, the commander of the occupation zone may suspend the implementation of the measures by the German central organization, and then the Allied Control Council will make the final decision.

[Central News Agency London Sixth Dispatch] French Foreign Minister Bidault submitted a document to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference last night, clarifying the three main principles that the French government has formulated for the economic foundation of Germany: France firmly insists that the restoration of Germany should not have priority over the economic restoration of the Allied countries. France hopes to establish a special government in the Ruhr, the center of German mineral production, in order to meet the necessary conditions for security. The issue of reparations cannot be separated from the issue of security. France believes that we can distribute a large number of non-essential machinery and equipment in Germany to Allied countries that have suffered from the war, in order to limit Germany's industrial potential. Germany must make every effort to prevent it from continuing to become a burden on the occupying countries and must balance its international balance of payments with its resources. France does not object to Germany being a single economic entity, including the Ruhr and Rhineland, but France has always believed that Saar constitutes an integral part of the French economic and monetary area.

### Soviet Intentions Clearly Revealed; Aims to Destroy the Economic Organization of the Anglo-American Zone and Prevent Germany from Participating in the Marshall Plan

[Reuters London Sixth Dispatch] Molotov's unwillingness to allow Germany to establish any kind of economic partnership with the Western powers has now been openly stated. Molotov's proposals on German economic principles only involve general principles, while the three foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France want Molotov to provide opinions on specific issues. Molotov's purpose is nothing more than the following two points: To systematically destroy the economic organization of the Anglo-American zone in Germany; To prevent Germany from participating in the Marshall Plan for European aid, either in whole or in part.

Molotov proposed to exchange the abolition of the economic institutions of each region for Germany's payment of the reparations demanded by the Soviet Union and the free exchange of materials in the four zones of Germany. In addition, Molotov also advocated the immediate establishment of a German central administrative structure. He believed that preparations for the establishment of a German central government should be made. After the establishment of these two governments, regardless of whether they are temporary in nature, Molotov will be prepared to establish a German central organization. However, its specific form and nature have not yet been clearly stated by Molotov. The intention of the Soviet Union is to rapidly concentrate economic power in the hands of the Germans in accordance with the way the Soviet Union wants, but at the same time, it allows the commanders of each region to hold broad powers to formulate economic systems within their jurisdictions. The latter can prevent the excessive expansion of the rights of the German central organization or prevent the development of the German economy in a way that is not approved by the Soviet Union.

### Power Outage at the 16th Pier Last Night, Bureau Chief Gave Instructions in Person, Brightness Restored Immediately

The problem of power outages in the southern city is of great concern to all parties. Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, made a special trip to inspect Zhaojiabang Road, Dengyun Road, the 16th Pier, Zhonghua Road, and Xujiahui last night around 5:00 PM. When Zhao arrived in the southern city, the power supply everywhere was normal. However, at around 6:00 PM, the power supply in the Yimiao District and the 16th Pier area was suddenly cut off. After Zhao personally went to the Huashang Electric Company on Chezhan Road to inspect the power generation situation of the company, he found that the company's power generation had already reached its maximum load. Except for the Yimiao District, which was originally cut off for line maintenance and should be temporarily suspended, the current in the 16th Pier area was due to the surge in demand from factories after several days of power outages. The power for the factories should have been stopped during the exchange of electricity for large lights at around 5:00 or 6:00 PM, but some factories failed to comply, resulting in a sudden increase in the company's load. As a last resort, the power supply to the 16th Pier area was temporarily suspended. After Zhao instructed the company personnel to transfer part of the power to electricity users, the 16th Pier area was restored to brightness at around 7:00 PM.

Insufficient Power Supply Prompts Increased Equipment

According to Zhao, the total power supply for the entire southern city, based on the current situation, requires 10,000 kilowatts. The current power generation of the Huashang Electric Company is 6,600 kilowatts, plus 1,400 kilowatts from the Longhua Cement Plant, which is only 8,000 kilowatts, still short of 2,000 kilowatts. Zhao is urging the company to increase its equipment to make up for the company's total load. In addition, Zhao has scheduled to convene the person in charge of the company this afternoon to study strategies to make up for this power shortage.

### City Councilors Visit Wusong Gas Plant, Production Increases Daily, Economic Difficulties, Plan to Expand Next Year

[Our Newspaper] The Wusong Gas Plant in Shanghai was established after reorganizing enemy property in 1945 and is directly under the Public Utilities Bureau. In the early days of the takeover, the buildings in the factory were full of holes. After the factory employees repaired them, they officially resumed supply on New Year's Day of the following year. The results have been good in the past two years, and the daily output has reached 800,000 cubic feet. In response to the recommendations of the responsible persons of the Public Utilities Group of the City Council, the plant specially invited City Councilors Wang Zhuyi, He Yuanming, Jiang Hao, Qu Yue, Wang Ziyang, Li Wenjie, Wang Jian'e, and others to visit the Wusong plant yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to see the gas production situation. Zhang Rentao, Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, also accompanied them. Xu Baojun, Director of the plant, reported on the progress of its business, stating that: Initially, the gas supply area was limited to a corner of the city center, with few users and difficulties in promotion. Later, due to the insufficient supply from the British Shanghai Gas Company, the plant supplied gas. Initially, it was only 100,000 cubic feet per day, and then increased to 450,000 cubic meters. Although the Wusong Gas Plant has only been around for eight or nine years, it is not impossible to compete with the Shanghai Gas Company, which has a history of 70 or 80 years, in terms of business. It is only because of

Economic Difficulties

That it has not been fully developed. Because the machinery and equipment of the plant were pieced together by the Japanese in those years, reducing labor and saving materials, and were also damaged by bombing and shocks, the service life will inevitably be reduced if they are not repaired immediately. The plant has now prepared a next year's expansion plan: Increase the construction of mechanical gas generators to increase production. Orders have been placed in the United States, and they can be shipped by the end of next year, at an estimated cost of 2.5 billion national currency. Increase the construction of tar separators. Orders have been placed in the United Kingdom, and they can be shipped by the end of next year, at an estimated cost of 300 million national currency. Add eight-inch high-pressure pipes so that the increased gas volume can be directly sent to the gas storage tank of the Shanghai Gas Company. An application has been submitted to the Relief Administration for allocation, and it is estimated that it will cost about 3 billion national currency. Add a 500-foot deep well, which will cost about 1 billion national currency. According to Deputy Director Zhang, the municipal government has

Total Investment

Up to now, the amount is 1 billion yuan. At that time, it cost 600 million yuan to buy machines from the enemy and puppet property office, and 300 million yuan for the land. Therefore, the economic situation is very difficult, just like getting through the New Year every day. Therefore, in order to seek business development, economic assistance must be given. After the councilors visited yesterday, they unanimously agreed that its future is very promising. Qu Yue also said: I hope that everyone in Shanghai will have gas in the future, and I hope that the colleagues of the Wusong Gas Plant can seek benefits for all citizens.

[Our Newspaper] The Longhua Police Sub-bureau received a report from Police Inspector Li Kaixi, stationed at Longhua Airport, stating that China National Aviation Corporation's Flight No. 47, which flew from Pi to Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai at around 4:00 PM on the third of last month. When inspecting several pieces of luggage at around 9:00 AM on the morning of the 25th, it was found that two packages of smuggled goods were hidden in the tail of the plane. After the person in charge of the company took them away for inspection, it was said that they were opium and heroin, weighing about 60 kilograms.

According to his confession: On the afternoon of November 3, someone named Gu told me that Flight No. 47 was carrying smuggled goods such as rhino yellow and asked me to

Find a Way to Take It Down

Send it to Room 206 on the second floor of No. 587 Jing'an Temple Road. That night, I tried to find a way for him, but the cargo was too large to carry out. On the morning of the fourth, the company discovered it, and I immediately went to Room 506 of the Datong Hotel, which Gu had opened, to inform him. According to Gu, these two packages of smuggled goods were not illegal items and still told me to find out the news every day. On the 11th, I saw in the newspaper that the items seized by the company were all opium drugs. In addition, three months ago, Sun Shougao had asked me to take private goods for Gu once, a total of four small packages. It was said that they were also rhino yellow. At that time, I asked Wei Wenxiang to

Help Carry It Out

Took it to the dormitory in Dapu Bridge. The next day, Sun Shougao and Gu took it away, and Sun paid me a reward of 15 million yuan, and I gave Wei Wenxiang 8 million yuan. So, I suspected that the previous items were also opium drugs. I panicked for a while, and then discussed with Sun Shougao, Wei Wenxiang, etc. On the 10th, I took my family back to Chongming to avoid the disaster temporarily. At that time, I saw Nie Chengshan asking Gu for

Nine Gold Bars

And so on. Then, Section Member Guo went to the airport to arrest technician Sun Shougao, who confessed that three months ago, Gu had asked me to take out four small packages of private goods from the plane. It was said that they were rhino yellow brought from Kunming. I was asked to send two packages to Gu's residence on Jing'an Temple Road, and I received a reward of 20 million yuan. The other two packages were instructed to be sent to Yin Liangchen at No. 5 Yu Ye Li, Linsen Middle Road, and I also received a reward of 10 million yuan.

Lin Fengmian's Painting Thought Embodies the Renaissance

In Lin Fengmian's thirty-year painting career, this decade of silence holds special significance. During this time, he never held a single exhibition. While many fashionable artists were exceptionally active, he remained silent, like an ancient prophet, quietly seeking his truth in the desert. His immortal paintings, styles, and tones, after this decade of absolute struggle, are now finally presented to us for the first time, the abundant harvest he reaped in the desert.

Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, for the past few centuries, due to the prevalence of Neo-Confucianism, Chinese thought has consistently emphasized rationality while suppressing instinct (the so-called "upholding heavenly principles and curbing human desires"). The arid atmosphere of absolute asceticism permeated Chinese culture, preventing lively, instinctive emotions from rising to the fore. This tendency to destroy basic human nature was reflected in painting through the popularity of literati painting and the pursuit of mystical, rational realms. Consequently, emptiness, tranquility, and solemnity became paramount, with as little flavor of the human world as possible.

The fundamental characteristic of the Chinese Renaissance must inevitably be

the rediscovery of "man" and the re-emergence of human nature. The stimulus for the revival of modern Chinese art, on the one hand, was certainly classical Greek and Han-Tang art, but more importantly, it was the entirety of art following the Western Renaissance. Only the humanist thought of the West since the Renaissance can rescue the emptiness and aridity of Chinese art in recent centuries. The non-worldly aspects of painting must be based on the worldly to be complete. The ultimate ethereal must be achieved from a vigorous corporeal starting point. True transcendence and emptiness can only be achieved through the real existence of nature and human nature as a source. Here, Lin Fengmian is the first person in modern China to boldly accept the entirety of modern Western humanist thought, use it as a foundation, and then use a completely new gaze to view the East, select from the East, and finally return to the East.

Seeing a New Era

To view Lin Fengmian's paintings, one must penetrate their beautiful exterior and go straight into the depths behind the beauty, capturing the profound core ideas and core emotions. His focus is clearly not on the pursuit of pure formal beauty, but rather on establishing a brand-new belief in the culture of tomorrow, a philosophy of life for tomorrow, and, as the primary foundation of both, the "feeling of tomorrow." Because of this, some decorative, aesthetic works, initially appealing, become increasingly fragile the more one looks at them. These beauties are not enduring. The formal beauty of Lin Fengmian's paintings is underpinned by a profound set of life ideas, so they are solid, durable, and increasingly rewarding to contemplate. His paintings are not just paintings; they are prophecies of the era. In his paintings, we can see a new era, a new human nature, a new cultural essence, and, more importantly, a brand-new "feeling of tomorrow" that serves as the overall foundation for the aforementioned three. If the paintings of the Renaissance masters foreshadowed the tendencies of the European cultural spirit in recent centuries, then Lin Fengmian's female figures, although they are still constantly experimenting and developing, have already begun to depict, to some extent, the spiritual countenance of the future Chinese Renaissance (which is also the beginning of the world Renaissance). Lin Fengmian's paintings (mainly female figures) bring us hope, light, and optimism. In the history of Chinese painting, the significance of Lin Fengmian's ability to occupy a unique high peak lies here. If his painting were merely a revolution in form, it would only be a tributary of the times and would never have become such a major force.

Unique Achievements in Line

Lin Fengmian's achievements in line are almost unprecedented. Before him, no Chinese painter had ever dared to transform lines so boldly. For the past few centuries, painters have been circling within traditional conventions, unlike the ancients who directly delved into nature and observed nature. Although lines were intended to imitate the ethereal spirit of the ancients, they lacked the basic sense of life evoked by delving into nature. As a result, they became increasingly empty and fragile, becoming either imperfect copies of ancient paintings or imperfect copies of copies. These fragile, thin, and stiff lines, through Lin Fengmian's decades of hard work and struggle, were transformed for the first time, revived, enriched, and restored to the scale and vitality they had a thousand years ago. His lines are so unique precisely because he absorbed the essence of oil paint. He is the first person of his time to dissolve the flavor of Western oil paint into Chinese ink, which is why his lines are so charming, solid, spirited, and rich.

The porcelain-like exquisiteness, harmony, and dexterity of Lin Fengmian's female figure paintings are not only the result of his influence from Song porcelain but are also clearly the crystallization of extreme inspiration. Due to the strong ink absorption of xuan paper and the quick-drying nature of ink, these paintings must be painted extremely quickly. The painter must undergo intense patience, forge a high degree of passion, and, in a state of white-hot spirit, use his skilled experience with lines and colors to capture the highest spiritual spark onto the paper in a flash. In creating these paintings, not a single stroke can be flawed (oil paintings are built up). When viewing those female figures, I often have the feeling of watching lightning at night, especially those ink paintings with few colors, where the dark clothes set off the extremely bright face, giving people a lightning-like sense of brightness, as well as a high degree of pleasure, tranquility, beauty, and wisdom. In Cézanne's landscapes, due to those axe-split, emotionally charged lines and wonderful combinations, the same lightning flashes, a harmonious sense of clarity and wisdom.

Deliberate and Refined Pursuit for Thirty Years

Undoubtedly, the works at the highest peak of art history are always the crystallization of extremely balanced emotion and reason. Only such works are exquisite, solid, ethereal, and healthy, a harmonious combination of spirit and flesh. Lin Fengmian, however, only began to achieve this after thirty years of hard work and deliberate pursuit. He is desperately strengthening it, developing it, making it even clearer, richer, more solid, and more mature.

Lin Fengmian strives to pursue the ideal tools of Greek beauty with two things: one is the humanism of the Western Renaissance, and the other is the naturalism of Eastern Lao Zhuang. The spirit of his paintings is clearly a fusion of these two different thoughts, and the artistic spirit expressed after this fusion not only symbolizes the spirit of future new painting but also symbolizes the basic spirit of the emerging world culture after the fusion of Eastern and Western cultures. Lin Fengmian has gone through more than thirty years of struggle. The struggle of the past thirty years is over. This should only be the preparation for another thirty years of his struggle. In this new thirty-year struggle, we hope that he will snatch the most eternal and immortal truth from the deepest part of the Palace of Truth and throw it onto his paintings, not only to open the eyes of the Chinese art world but, more importantly, to open the eyes of the world art world as well.

### The Manager of Maochang Company Talks About Maochang's Eyeglasses

Not long ago, news came from the American medical community that American ophthalmologists could cure blind people who had been blind for many years, restoring their sight. The other day, I received a letter from an elderly blind person in a distant place, asking me to inquire in Shanghai about the truth of this news. Motivated by this, yesterday, the reporter specially visited Zhang Deqian, the optometry expert and deputy manager of Maochang Eyeglasses Company.

His answer was quite disappointing for my blind relative in the distance. Regarding the current situation of ophthalmology in the American medical community, he said, "No one in the United States or other countries has yet researched a method that can completely restore sight to a blind person." Then he said, "There is also no way to cure nearsightedness to this day." Because the tunic of the eyeball is composed of tightly knit fibrous tissue, once the eyeball develops nearsightedness, the tunic tissue softens, elongates, and thins. If one wants to return the position of the tunic to the focal point formed by the incident light, it is an impossible thing. Fortunately, although nearsightedness cannot be cured, it is possible to find ways to slow down its deepening. These methods, in addition to improving school hygiene and popularizing optical knowledge, include wearing accurate eyeglasses, all of which can help alleviate the suffering of nearsightedness. Regarding whether wearing accurate eyeglasses is effective in slowing down the speed of nearsightedness, he said: Anyone with experience believes this to be true.

He led the reporter to visit the manufacturing department upstairs. Thousands of workers were buried in configuring, from polishing rouge to grinding gray sand, lenses, and frames. Almost all are imported goods. Imported goods require foreign exchange, and everyone knows the difficulty of settling foreign exchange today. Therefore, their import of raw materials has become a major problem. Obstacles in ship traffic have meant that their orders in the United States last year have not yet arrived in Shanghai. Funds are frozen, and business development is indirectly hindered. General Manager Hu Gengpei said: Maochang's brand name, MC, is very famous in the "eyeglasses class" in South America, Singapore, the East Indies, and various European countries. That is to say, the precision of their business and products can compete with the United States and remain ahead of various countries in the Far East. Several famous American eyeglasses companies, AO, Baixuelong, Peisidan, COC, Martin, and Rogers, are all Maochang's specially appointed or exclusive dealers in China. Because raw materials are not easy to import, exports are affected, and the foreign markets are now being taken away by others.

Speaking of their MC brand name, which is engraved on the side of the lens and is so subtle that it is not easy to see, there is an interesting story. Last year, a soldier came to Shanghai from Guilin and said that the Maochang branch in Guilin had made a mistake in the degree of the nearsighted glasses they had configured for him, and he asked for a re-examination and a new configuration. They told the soldier that other than the head office in Shanghai, there was only one branch in Nanjing, and the "Maochang" eyeglasses company in Guilin was a counterfeit. Upon inspection of the side of the lens, there was indeed no MC brand name. However, they still gave the soldier a free eye exam and configured another pair for him.

Before the war, when Pan Gongzhan was the director of the city's education bureau, in view of the fact that students' poor eyesight was affecting their studies, he negotiated with the company to provide free eye exams for students in elementary, middle, and high schools throughout the city, and to provide eyeglasses on an obligatory basis at a special price. After the war, encouraged by the hygiene educator Zhou Shang, the company still configured eyeglasses for students at a price of 50,000 yuan per pair. In order to maintain the lowest cost, the price was recently raised to 80,000 yuan per pair. Speaking of their providing free eye exams for customers, it has attracted dissatisfaction from their peers. It is said that several companies charge as much as one million yuan for eye exams, which they believe is an irrational exorbitant charge. For social service and to meet universal needs, they first decided to provide free eye exams. They also only maintain the lowest profit in terms of price.

### The Fish Market Resumed Operations Yesterday

The city's fish market suddenly announced its closure for one day the day before yesterday. According to the person in charge of the fish market, the recent UNRRA relief fishing vessels have been shipping large quantities of fish goods to Shanghai for dumping, creating a situation of oversupply, which has caused the market price to plummet. Therefore, they refused to unload and wholesale goods the day before yesterday as a protest against UNRRA and had no other purpose. It officially resumed operations yesterday.

### The National Postal Workers' Representative Conference Held Proposal Review Meetings Yesterday

Meeting Group: The general union will be renamed the "National Federation of Postal Workers of the Republic of China." The internal organization will be set up with five groups: organization, publicity, general affairs, welfare, and research. An accounting office, inspection office, postal worker movement, design committee, and women's movement committee will also be established. Year-end Index Group: Responsible for studying the cost of living index and year-end bonus issues.

### The Unfilial Son Returns to Fei, Talking to Our Reporter About Escaping Danger and Creation

[Report from this newspaper, Hefei, 6th] Xiang Kaiyan, also known as "Unfilial Student of Pingjiang", who served as a Major General Secretary in the 21st Army Group Headquarters in Dabie Mountain during the War of Resistance, and is famous for his novels "The Strange Heroes of the Jianghu" and "Unofficial History of Studying in the East", was captured after the bandits occupied Lihuang on September 2nd. The news spread, and the cultural circles were holding their breath. Now Xiang has escaped danger and arrived in Fei, converting to the Mingjiao Temple, the only ancient temple in Anhui located in the East Street of the city. In recent days, many people from cultural circles have visited him. Mr. Xiang, with white beard and a bald head, is full of spirit and talks eloquently about his experience as a prisoner, which has become what the cultural circles at home are happy to hear. A special report is as follows:

Captured and Imprisoned in Xiangshan Temple

After the victory, Mr. Xiang, because he was infatuated with Indian Buddhism and indifferent to fame and wealth, resolutely resigned from his military position, focused on research, and wrote a long novel based on historical materials from the early Qing Dynasty to the present, spanning more than 300 years. It is estimated that it will reach 2 million words, titled "Unofficial History of the Revolution", to supplement the shortcomings of official history. At that time, the provincial government, in order to commemorate the late Chairman Liao Yannong (of the founding) and the generals and soldiers who sacrificed for the country, decided to build Liao Gong Ancestral Hall, Loyalty Memorial Shrine, and Victory Memorial Tower in Lihuang, the root location of the Dabie Mountains, and asked Mr. Xiang to stay in the mountains to supervise the construction. Mr. Xiang could not refuse these three major projects and stayed in Xiangshan Temple in front of Liao Gong's tomb. Before the wood project was completed, on September 2nd, with a thunderbolt, the bandits sneaked into Lihuang. On the 3rd, Mr. Xiang was captured by the bandits to the headquarters in Gubeichong, ten miles away, and became a prisoner.

Answering Interrogation at Gubeichong

The next day, he was interrogated about his name by the so-called Minister of Administration, Shi Zirong, etc. Mr. Xiang stated it frankly. Shi and others showed respect. They asked if he had ever studied books by Mao Zedong, Guo Moruo, Lu Xun, etc.? He replied: I have not read books after the Tang and Song dynasties. Asked what he thought of the Communist Army? He replied: Before gaining political power, you abuse policies, only to attract hatred from the people. Moreover, you stubbornly defend the barren Lihuang, and in the future, if you don't freeze to death, you will also starve to death. Shi and others were silent for a long time after hearing this. Later, they asked, would you like to go to Jiamusi to be an instructor? He replied: I have never read books of the Marx type. If you teach me the good plays of Laozi, Zhuangzi, the Four Books, and the Five Classics, I'm afraid it won't be to your taste.

Writing Unofficial History in Mingjiao Temple

The bandits knew that he could not be subdued and placed Mr. Xiang under house arrest for eight days, confiscating his clothes, books, etc. They said to Mr. Xiang: Based on the principle of not killing the virtuous, you can leave at your convenience. Mr. Xiang then escaped from the tiger's mouth and returned to the temple. In the debris, he retrieved the incomplete manuscripts of "Party Life Unofficial History", the crystallization of his years of hard work. After more than a month of sorting and supplementing, one night, in a dark and windy time, he wore a gray cotton robe, waded through water, climbed mountains, left the red circle of terror, and arrived in Hefei, the provincial capital. According to Mr. Xiang, he is still writing 8,000 words of the unfinished "Unofficial History of the Revolution" every day in the incense-filled smoke. Once it is completed and published, he will wear bamboo sandals and return to his lovely hometown of Pingjiang, Hunan.

### Rewards Offered for the Capture of a Leopard and a Tiger

(Report from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 6th) The Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, and Yangzhou Counties Clearing Command has launched a full-scale clearing operation against the remaining bandits in its jurisdiction. Now it is offering rewards of 20 million yuan to inform on and capture bandit leaders Zhao Wenbao and Nie Laohu. At the same time, it issued a brief announcement of the clearing: During the clearing period, all troops and public forces should cooperate and work together, regardless of regional boundaries, and strive to advance the clearing. County, district, township, bao, and jia heads and local gentry should lead the public to fight against the bandits. Those who dare to collude with bandits, hide bandits, let bandits go, conceal bandits, or collect bandit grain on their behalf will be executed by firing squad. Those who report bandits, secretly report bandit information, and automatically kill bandits will be heavily rewarded.

### Zhou Zhongda Happily Recovers His Belongings, Zheng Taiqiu Painfully Suffers Interrogation: The First Attempt to Steal Failed on the Spot

(Report from this newspaper, Suzhou, 6th) Zhou Zhongyuan, a cloth merchant from Yangzhou, carried 49 million yuan in cash on the night of the 4th to travel from Zhenjiang to Shanghai by night express military train to remit funds. Near Suzhou, because he was tired from the journey, he temporarily closed his eyes to rest. Suddenly, he discovered that the leather bag storing the money under his seat was missing. In a panic, he got off the military train and reported to the road police at the Suzhou military station. Upon inspection of the passengers on the military train, a young thief was fortunately caught on the spot, and the leather bag with the cash was recovered. According to the thief, named Zheng Taiqiu, it was his first time stealing. He is currently being interrogated by the police's second branch.

It has been passed by the Provincial Government meeting and ordered the entire province to comply with it. According to this method, the rate of turning brown rice into white rice and wheat into flour must not be lower than 85%. It also advocates simple eating and as much mixed grain as possible. It is forbidden to use major food grains such as rice, wheat, and sorghum for winemaking. Violators will be suspended.

### Will Hong Kong Become the "Eastern Reno"? "Miss Shanghai" Causes a Scene with a Disheveled Divorce

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 4th] These days in Hong Kong, "Miss" seems to always be associated with bad luck, attracting trouble. Shanghai's Miss Xie Jiahua, who doesn't cause problems elsewhere, comes to Hong Kong and puts on a show that is more realistic and exciting than a movie. It is reported in the newspapers and said by people that Miss Xie came to Hong Kong to film a movie under contract with Dachung British Film Company, but who knew that she was actually using this as an opportunity to leave her husband!

Yesterday, her husband, Rong Meixin, rushed to Hong Kong from Shanghai. Miss Xie personally went to the airport to greet him! The two crossed the sea together to the scenic Repulse Bay Hotel. There, the two got into a fight, and the hotel authorities "evicted" them. Miss Xie then ran towards the Great China Dormitory in Kowloon across the harbor, with her hair disheveled and crying all the way. It is said that Miss Xie has telegraphed her mother in Shanghai to come to Hong Kong, determined to get a divorce from Rong Meixin. Hong Kong people have given Rong Meixin the title of "Paint King," in contrast to Xie Jiahua's "Miss Shanghai." This story has opened a new scene for the idle class in Hong Kong, which is already quite lively.

It is remembered that not long ago, Yang Xiuqiong also traveled all the way from Shanghai back to Hong Kong to formally file for divorce, coinciding with the formal divorce of "Miss Hong Kong" Wu Danfeng on the same day! It is said that a Shanghai lawyer named Yu Xiangzhen came to Hong Kong at the same time as King Rong—in due time, this small island in the south may very well become the "Reno of the East"!

### A Trip to Hong Kong

— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper

(Continued from Page 2) Amidst the frequent exchanges between Hong Kong and mainland China, there is also the issue of relocating residents of Kowloon City, which is a matter of public concern. Around the time I arrived in Hong Kong, this issue was causing a lot of uproar, and various newspapers were actively reporting on it. The Hong Kong Government's Public Works Department issued a notice on the 27th of last month, giving over two thousand residents two weeks to move out. Their reason is based on the regulations of the Public Land Rights Ordinance promulgated by the Hong Kong Government, which states that the Public Works Department has the right to order the evacuation of residents or any buildings erected on this land and to demolish such buildings if they do not comply. The Chinese government, on the other hand, believes that the core of the issue lies in the sovereignty over the administration of Kowloon City. It is the third time that the Hong Kong government has asked the residents of the city to move. There was a similar incident in the summer of 1933, but because the area of the city was small, the population sparse, and Guangdong Province did not usually establish officials to govern it, and the Hong Kong authorities also considered the Sino-British treaties, it was not enforced later. Currently, Special Commissioner Guo Dehua of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has gone to Beijing to seek instructions on this matter and has begun negotiations with the Hong Kong government. At the same time, the Guangdong Provincial Assembly has also risen to discuss methods of support and negotiation. During my stay in Hong Kong, when discussing this case with Chinese residents, everyone paid close attention to it, advocating that the government should fight for justice based on reason. Eight years of war have greatly enhanced the political awareness of Chinese residents in Hong Kong, and they are no longer as indifferent as they used to be. This point is commendable and worthy of attention.

Smuggling and Gold Rush Each Display Their Abilities

Based on what I saw and heard during this trip, I feel that the issue of smuggling is still extremely serious. The shops on Hong Kong Island are stacked with goods, and customers are crowded. The bustling scene is in no way inferior to that before the war. Des Voeux Road and Queen's Road Central are mostly occupied by foreign goods stores selling clothing materials, department stores, and so on. The store's flower colors are various and beautiful, with many items, the United States and the United Kingdom may not be able to buy, but in Hong Kong, they are everywhere. Woolen cloth, wool, fabrics and other clothing materials are of good quality and cheap. High-quality women's woolen cloth costs 25 Hong Kong dollars and can be bought much better than 1.3 to 1.4 million in Shanghai. Wool vests are priced from ten to twenty dollars. High-grade nylon stockings sell for seven to eleven Hong Kong dollars. Cosmetics are also very cheap. It is no wonder that smugglers regard Hong Kong as a gold mine. In addition, clock exchange shops and fountain pen sales are everywhere. The price is about one-half or one-third cheaper than in Shanghai. Most of the people walking on the street and negotiating prices in the shops are travelers from various places handling goods. I personally saw a middle-aged woman buying six or seven watches worth tens of millions from a watch shop, discussing the price of watches in Shanghai with a friend sitting next to her, obviously buying them to prepare for business. The hawkers on the street and the waiters in the tea rooms, when they pull out the pens from their pockets to write, are all dazzling Parker type 51 fountain pens. These days, Christmas is approaching, and the shops are all decorated with lights and colors, showing great courtesy to customers, offering cigarettes and gifts, hoping to attract more business. However, during my strolls, I discovered something worthy of attention, which is that any kind of American goods are not much cheaper than in Shanghai. So I asked an old Hong Kong resident, who replied, "This is the specialty of the British! After American goods are loaded into the warehouse, it is always difficult to get them out, and sometimes even a price limit must be set before they are allowed to be sold..." This made me understand the inside story. In addition, I also received a negative answer to the widespread rumor that Japanese goods were selling well in Hong Kong. Because, at least when I was walking around, I had never seen Japanese goods.

Easy to Earn, Generous in Spending

Speaking of the lives of ordinary residents, due to

Because the currency is stable and price fluctuations are small, it seems that everyone is living a stable life. Everyone is dressed quite neatly, and walking around does not have the tense state of striving for survival like people in Shanghai. The Cantonese tea rooms are filled with tea drinkers all day long. In high-end restaurants, female attendants are still dressed up flamboyantly. The sound of mahjong can be heard all over the street. I asked a female attendant how much she earns each month, and she replied that it was about eight hundred to one thousand yuan. I also asked a male attendant, and he said that he could also earn about four hundred yuan a month. However, among these high-end diners, there are fewer Cantonese and Hong Kong people, and most of them are Shanghai buyers who "earn easily and spend generously." I stayed in Hong Kong for four days, and we were worried about food and accommodation every day, because eating and drinking are really shockingly expensive, almost ten times higher than in Shanghai. A reporter ordered a small bowl of shrimp fried rice and paid nearly four Hong Kong dollars. Three reporters went to Jianguo Restaurant once and only ate a set meal of three dishes and one soup, and the bill was more than thirty Hong Kong dollars, which is equivalent to about one million national currency. Hotels are also expensive, costing about thirty Hong Kong dollars per day. This is why travelers say, "Chang'an is good, but it cannot be lived in for long."

Frequent Transportation, Fines for Spitting

In terms of transportation, Hong Kong has become an air transport center, with as many as eleven or twelve international airlines on the ground floor to the left of the Peninsula Hotel. Ships arrive and depart every day, making it more convenient than during the war. The prosperity of Hong Kong is built on the foundation of transportation. Speaking of urban transportation, it is still as well-organized as before. Streetcars start at one dollar and five cents, public buses cost three cents regardless of distance, trams cost two cents first class and one cent third class, and ferries cost two cents first class and one cent third class. In addition to transportation, general municipal administration seems to be more advanced than in the past. Residents believe that the Hong Kong government enforces the law strictly, and the British can lead by example, so they can abide by the law everywhere. Whether traveling by military transport or walking on the road, it is not as tense and chaotic as in Shanghai. Recently, because Hong Kong Island is humid and tuberculosis is rampant, the Hong Kong government has specifically prohibited residents from spitting anywhere, with fines of twenty-five to one hundred Hong Kong dollars for violators. Now, pedestrians on the road are careful to comply, and it has gradually become a habit. In addition, on issues such as commodity prices, once the government sets a price, it is not allowed to be raised without authorization, otherwise, a penalty will be imposed. When I was in Hong Kong, I saw them buying goods at the government price, and both parties could strictly comply. Unlike merchants in our country hoarding and speculating, commodity prices fluctuate several times a day. As for the Hong Kong dollars issued by the Hong Kong government, everyone trusts them, and there is no inflation. All these things show that the British have the ability to govern, which is worthy of our learning.

### Students Returning from Japan Declare Hearts are Pure

[Shenzhou News Agency] Japanese students Yu Zhiqiang, Wang Qingxiang, and others returned to China on the British ship Boktai from Saho last month. The ship arrived here the day before yesterday. Because the students had no place to live in Shanghai, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office provided accommodation and arranged for them to be sent back to their hometowns. Yesterday, student Yu Zhiqiang said that there are currently more than 1,400 students still studying in Japan. They are eager to return to China as soon as possible because life in Japan is extremely difficult, and their families in China cannot remit money to support them. For the sake of their studies, they have to endure hardship. The so-called Imperial Universities in Japan all removed the word "Imperial" in September of this year. Courses related to national defense science, such as "Mechanical Chemistry" and "Atomic Research," have been canceled. The attitude of professors towards Chinese students has also changed. Finally, the student expressed to reporters that although they studied in Japan in the past, their hearts and minds are absolutely pure and holy. He hopes that people in the country will sympathize with and understand them.

Full Round Robin System

Scheduled to Perform at Gymnasium This Weekend The Municipal Sports Association Table Tennis Committee, at the suggestion of Chairman Wang Yi, has reformed the competition system. The new proposal is named the "Full Round Robin System." This method uses five-person competitions, in which members of both teams take turns competing against each other. Each game is scored with ten points for a tie, and each person is counted as a win or loss for one game. Regardless of the outcome of the win or loss (according to the original international rules, the first to win thirteen games is the winner), all twenty-five games must be played. This new competition system allows both strong and weak players to have the opportunity to make contact, saves time, is more intense, and is fairer than other systems. According to Chen Lin, general manager of the association, it is hoped that the scoring for each game will be adjusted to 20 points for a tie, which would be even more thorough. It is understood that the association has decided to hold a public demonstration at the gymnasium this weekend to test the system in practice, and all are welcome to visit.

### Qingbai Bai Initially Meets a Strong Opponent; Loses 2-5 to the Jewish Team

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Qingbai Bai, the brother team of the Qingbai Football Team, made their debut yesterday afternoon in the Jia Group League at Yiyuan, facing the Jewish team. Qingbai Bai ultimately lost 2-5 to the dark horse due to insufficient experience and strength, losing after initially leading. Qingbai Bai scored two goals first, but the Jewish team tied the score, making it 2-2 at halftime. In the second half, the Jewish team was extremely aggressive, and the young players were overwhelmed by the strong opponent, losing three consecutive goals, resulting in a final score of 5-2. The audience at Yiyuan yesterday was estimated at 2,000 people, with ticket sales reaching over 16 million yuan.

Referee Ni Xiaoben. In the first half, the young players of Qingbai Bai were quite active and handled the Jewish team with ease. The Jewish team's tactics seemed disjointed, especially goalkeeper Wen Nuogan's carelessness, which allowed Lin Gui to open the scoring, followed by Xue Peiran, making it 2-0. Ultimately, due to the slight inferiority of Qingbai Bai's defense and midfield, the Jewish team, being veterans, managed to equalize with shots from Stan and Liu Han. Carlory further contributed, making it 2-2 at halftime. In the second half, Xu Guofu committed a foul in the penalty area, and Quebisiqi scored a penalty kick. Mai Lvxika and Carlory each scored again, resulting in a 5-2 victory. Jiang Qing of Qingbai Bai's clearance kicks were commendable.

### A Vital Force in Saving the Sugar Famine: Taiwan Sugar Corporation Strives for Production; Expected to Restore 1 Million Tons of Production in Five Years

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] Among the enemy properties taken over, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation of the National Resources Commission has been operating quite successfully in the past two years, with ambitious goals. In today's widespread global sugar famine, it is no exaggeration to consider Taiwan Sugar as a national treasure.

In early 1946, there were a total of 42 modern sugar factories in Taiwan. When they were taken over from the Japanese, they had either been damaged by air raids or neglected and left to decay due to human negligence. Rails, spikes, wheels, lubricants – everything was lacking, and the railway system was in a state of extreme dilapidation. The high profits from grain cultivation led farmers to abandon sugarcane and plant grain instead, and there was a shortage of fertilizers. Everything appeared fragmented and broken. It seemed that Taiwan Sugar was destined for total collapse, and the Japanese coldly watched, thinking that it could not be utilized!

US Loan Approval Expected

Today, however, Taiwan Sugar is not heading towards decline. The cadres sent by the motherland to take over and revive Taiwan Sugar have overcome numerous difficulties, worked hard, and, together with American technicians, laid the foundation for a five-year revival plan for Taiwan Sugar. Based on this foundation, Taiwan Sugar will continue to improve, and in five years, it can restore its glorious annual production of one million tons.

This is not just an empty plan on paper, but a culmination of efforts by many Chinese and foreign sugar manufacturing technicians and experts, who conducted numerous on-site investigations and studies and racked their brains to come up with it. The first research result was a five-year plan drafted by American sugar industry engineer Rose E.A. Rose. The total budget for the entire plan was US$30 million. This plan was later shelved for various reasons, and a second five-year plan emerged, requiring US$20 million. It was presented to the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which deemed it quite realistic and believed that Taiwan Sugar was a promising industry. Therefore, there are rumors that consideration for approval is likely to occur within one or two months.

Estimated Sugar Production in Five-Year Budget

According to this plan's budget, the progress of Taiwan Sugar over the five years can be seen in the following statistics: Year - Production Area (hundreds of acres) - Total Sugar Production (thousands of tons) - 1946-47: 78,934, 34 - 1947-48: 210,325, 25 - 1948-49: 281,558, 80 - 1949-50: 395,090, 7 - 1950-51: 432,011, 100. The sugar season is usually calculated from December of the previous year to May of the following year, which is also the sugarcane crushing season of the year. From sugarcane planting to harvest, it takes a full 18 months. From this, it is not difficult to imagine how much effort was spent to achieve the Taiwan Sugar production of 34,000 tons in the past year—which was also the most difficult year for Taiwan!

This year's production, according to the planned target, is 325,000 tons. Judging from all the signs this year, this projected target can be fully realized. Let's look at a few factors that support this: This year's typhoons have been mild, and the production fields have not been affected. The US$5 million loan from the Bank of China has enabled Taiwan Sugar to purchase the necessary machinery, railways, and other equipment from abroad to accelerate the completion of the restoration project. Seven or eight out of ten domestic sugar industry experts have been recruited by the National Resources Commission to participate in Taiwan Sugar. Special loans from the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Bank of Taiwan have solved the problem of Taiwan Sugar's local procurement of equipment. The fertilizer problem has been addressed this year with the procurement of 28,000 tons. These factors have provided a stabilizing anchor for Taiwan Sugar, which has been battered by wind and rain.

Encouraging Sugarcane Farmers to Increase Production

However, the problems are not completely resolved. In an environment where grain cultivation is more profitable, Taiwan Sugar came up with the idea of a sugar exchange method last year to bring back the sugarcane farmers' interest. This idea was to take the sugarcane collected from the sugarcane farmers, crush it into sugar, and give the farmers 48% and Taiwan Sugar 52%. Based on the prevailing sugar price, the sugarcane farmers were paid in cash. At the same time, seedlings, fertilizers, etc., were loaned out during planting. As a result, more than 30,000 tons of Taiwan Sugar were recovered from despair last year. This year, efforts are being redoubled to increase the sugarcane farmers' interest, and the sugar sharing ratio has been decided to be changed to 50% each. Based on a large-scale production of 300,000 tons of sugar, half of which will be paid to the sugarcane farmers in cash, it will require NT$25 billion, or approximately 3 trillion legal tender yuan. These funds need to be raised quickly in preparation for distribution between January and April next year. Currently, the Bank of Taiwan's issuance is already at full capacity, so it is said that Taiwan Sugar is negotiating with the Central Bank to find a solution. For the future of Taiwan Sugar, the Central Bank will certainly come up with a clever plan.

A Glimpse of Taiwan Sugar's Export Performance

In today's widespread global sugar famine, Taiwan Sugar's exports will undoubtedly be sought after everywhere. The question is whether we are willing to supply and how much we are willing to supply. From 1946 to 1947, Taiwan Sugar made its maiden export venture, totaling less than 3,000 tons. The largest exports were to Singapore and Hong Kong, and even Java, a sugar production region, imported Taiwan Sugar, with prices as high as £125 per ton, which is nothing short of a miracle. The export plan for 1947 to 1948 is to export 100,000 tons, of which Japan and India account for about 50%, and the rest will be distributed to the Near East, Malaya, Bangkok, and other regions. The current world price of sugar is approximately US$250. Taiwan Sugar is earning considerable foreign exchange for us. Let us pray that the US loan to revive Taiwan Sugar will be approved soon. Sweet Taiwan Sugar, the motherland needs you, and the world needs you!

### China Silk Corporation Invites Relevant Parties to Discuss Next Year's Sericulture Industry; Initial Decisions Reached for Seed Production and Mulberry Seedling Groups

The China Silk Corporation has been sparing no effort in guiding the improvement of the sericulture industry in recent years. It has achieved considerable success in increasing the production of mulberry seedlings, silkworm seeds, and silk cocoons. In order to plan for the national sericulture industry for the coming year, the company invited the heads of construction departments from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as relevant personnel, to hold group meetings starting on the 24th of last month. They discussed together in order to gather ideas, broaden their horizons, and exchange opinions. As of the end of last week, initial decisions had been reached regarding the seed production and mulberry seedling groups. The remaining groups, such as silk weaving finance, guidance, and production and sales, are still under discussion. The results of the discussions of the first and second groups are recorded below:

A. Amount of improved seeds for the coming spring in China: Net aseptic seed production in spring and autumn - Jiangsu: 836,158 sheets, Zhejiang: 237,900 sheets, Yunnan: 140,000 sheets, Other: 20,000 sheets, Total: 1,334,058 sheets.

B. Estimated demand for silkworm seeds in various provinces in China next spring: Jiangsu: 600,000 sheets, Zhejiang: 650,000 sheets, Guangdong: 50,000 sheets, Sichuan: 30,000 sheets (excluding the number imported from other provinces in addition to self-production), Other: 20,000 sheets, Total: 1,350,000 sheets. Compared with the supply, there is still a shortage of 120,000 sheets, and research is currently underway to manufacture in Guangdong and Taiwan, or purchase from Japan to supplement the shortfall. For the mulberry seedling portion, it is planned to purchase and promote 5.2 million seedling plants, with 5 million plants allocated to Guangdong and about 200,000 plants to other regions, all free of charge. In addition, 6 million grafted seedlings will be promoted to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces at low prices, with 2.5 million plants to each province. Approximately 1 million plants will be allocated to other regions.

### Felt Shoes and Felt Socks Exempted from Commodity Tax

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Ministry of Finance believes that the production volume of felt shoes and felt socks is very small, and they are mostly produced by family handicraft industries. Management is difficult. In consideration of the handicraft industry, felt shoes and felt socks are temporarily exempted from commodity tax. Subsequently, wool yarn, wool money, and woolen products such as felt hat blanks and felt are the target of commodity tax collection. Other woolen products will be exempt from tax unless there is a considerable output.

### Deadline for Import Merchant Registration with the Transportation and Management Committee of South China is the 10th

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th] The deadline for import merchant registration with the South China branch of the Transportation and Management Committee is set for the 10th. As of the 6th, 632 import merchants and 358 factories in Guangzhou City have applied for registration. The committee is scheduled to hold an import merchant registration review meeting on the 8th and discuss related matters. The Import Merchants Trade Association of Guangzhou is currently requesting improvements to the import settlement method and asking the Transportation and Management Committee branch to issue import permits promptly. The South China branch of the Transportation and Management Committee has also responded to the requests of merchants in Guangzhou to relax export and import quotas on an item-by-item basis. The important points include: Import merchant registration should be certified by government agencies. Registration certificates issued by tax authorities should be submitted at the time of registration. Agency for foreign manufacturers is limited to one agent. Indirect foreign factory agencies contracted by Guangzhou merchants with Hong Kong and Macau are also valid. The import ban on woolen fabrics cannot be lifted. Shipping companies are not allowed to register.

### Tianjin Commodity Prices Temporarily Stabilized

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 6th] Commodity prices in Tianjin have temporarily stabilized since the National, Provincial, and Municipal Banks stopped lending. Mayor Du Jianshi, in order to completely stabilize prices while considering the operations of legitimate businesses, telegraphed President Zhang Qun and Governor Zhang Jia'ao on the 6th. The telegram stated that in order to curb speculation, the Municipal Bank had been ordered to stop lending, and the Hebei Provincial Bank was also instructed to do the same. Subsequently, the National Bank also stopped lending, which was beneficial to stabilizing people's livelihoods. However, this is not a fundamental solution to stabilizing prices, and if no other remedies are sought, it is feared that legitimate businesses will become increasingly depressed due to difficulties in revolving funds. Please instruct the authorities to promptly review and implement measures to curb manipulation while maintaining legitimate business operations.

### Exports Increase

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 7th] According to statistics from the Tianjin Commodity Inspection Bureau, the total value of inspected and qualified export goods in November was 69.190,163,585 yuan, an increase of one-eighth compared to October. Pork bristles accounted for 45.308,310,385 yuan.

### Calcium Carbonate Production Does Not Meet the Needs of the Rubber Industry

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The price of calcium carbonate is rising, at around 9,500 to 600 yuan per pound. According to rubber industry sources, calcium carbonate is an essential raw material for manufacturing rubber, and various factories have a strong demand for it. Currently, only Da Zhonghua among the rubber factories in Shanghai can produce it themselves. Currently, the factories supplying calcium carbonate in Shanghai, such as Linghu, Meitai, Zhao Xin, and China, have increased their output, but it is still hoped that they will be encouraged to continue increasing production. It is reported that Linghu Chemical Plant, the largest in scale, can already produce more than 250 tons per month and will actively continue to increase production.

### Cigarette Supply Exceeds Demand, Prices Decline

Yesterday's cigarette market opened lower in the morning. Subsequently, it was heard that Yizhong Company had raised the price of ten large British cigarettes per carton (50,000 cigarettes) to 22.5 million yuan, Old Knife to 19 million yuan, and Hardman to 17 million yuan. However, due to tight credit, the industry was inactive. Around 9:00 AM, purchasing agents arrived, but prices remained high, and there was still a large supply. As a result, the prices of both British and Old Knife cigarettes fell by 700,000 to 500,000 yuan, Hardman dropped by 200,000 yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also saw declines.

### Woolen Fabrics Firm

Domestic woolen fabrics from local factories, such as wide and narrow camel wool, are more abundant this year than in previous years. The wholesale price of first-grade is 400,000 yuan per yard, second-grade 330,000-350,000 yuan, and third-grade 250,000-260,000 yuan. Sales are mostly to silk, satin, and foreign goods merchants, while formal woolen fabric stores on Qipan Street are less active. American camel wool, because it can be made into coats, is sold by many woolen fabric stores. Currently, the asking price for first-grade is 1.45 million yuan per yard, and second-grade is 1 million yuan. Formally imported sea otter hair, mohair, and sea tiger hair are very low. Long-haired wool from local factories is most popular among women, and nine out of ten women's winter coats are made from this material. Supply cannot meet demand, and market prices continue to rise. The wholesale price of Hailong brand is 1.25 million yuan per yard, and Yonghe brand is 1.15 million yuan.

### Qihong Tea Transactions Stable

Qimen black tea, under the constant attention of British merchants, continued to be traded over the weekend. However, the situation remains that sellers are numerous, and it is difficult to distinguish between them. As for various types of domestic sales, shops and stores in the street continue to stock up, and people generally express stability, so the market remains stable.

### Lumber Sales Sluggish

Recently, the lumber market has seen soft prices for fir and foreign pine due to sluggish sales and weak demand.

### A Ten-Year Scientific Research Plan for the United States

— Yang Shi

——Look at others, think of ourselves——

In the past, the United States absorbed scientific theories passed down from Europe. Today, it must make its own contributions to theoretical science. It must engage in large-scale scientific research to satisfy eager engineers. Airplanes are flying faster than sound, but there is still no complete theory to explain and prevent dangers. At the same time, the application of atomic energy requires new theoretical discoveries. In the past, the United States mostly used others' theories to invent many groundbreaking things. Previously, two German scientists relied on Italian research to discover the theory of nuclear fission, which inspired Americans to invent the atomic bomb. But today, it is no longer time for the United States to rely on others. Faced with this reality, a group of American scientific researchers, including military and non-military personnel, under the guidance of a presidential science advisor, conducted detailed and extensive discussions and submitted a report on a ten-year scientific research plan to the White House. They unanimously agreed that unless the United States delves into hard work for ten years, it will not have achievements comparable to others. The ten-year plan provides detailed guidance on the content and direction of research.

Exploring the Unknown

This is the first goal in future research. Whether from government or private funding, 90% will be used for new theoretical research, and the remaining 10% will be used for research on existing theories. Moreover, funding for basic scientific research should be four times the current amount. In the future, the amount spent on military weapons research needs to be reduced to be used for other urgently needed departments. It is projected that by 1957, basic scientific research will account for 20% of the total funding, while military research will only account for 40%. The rest will be provided by the Federal Treasury to engage in research. Research funding from the industrial sector is mostly focused on practical applications. In addition to doubling the efforts of government agencies, colleges also engage in this exploration of pure theory.

Medical Research

Currently, the United States spends only $28 million annually on medical and public health research. By 1957, it will have to spend $300 million to engage in medical and health research.

In 1947, the United States spent an unprecedented amount on scientific research. Excluding the confidential atomic energy research funding, there was as much as $1.16 billion, which is exactly ten times that of 1930 and twice the annual average during the war. But according to this plan, by 1957, it will have to be $2.2 billion. At first glance, it is daunting, but it only accounts for 1% of the country's total revenue. Many private companies have spent up to 2% of their annual revenue on new product research, and some have even spent 5% or 6%.

Training Talent

The first step is to train a large number of scientific workers. The current shortage of scientists is quite severe. Many government positions in the scientific field are vacant. The military still needs a quarter of the current number of personnel researching ballistics and radiation; and the Atomic Energy Commission cannot find many suitable scientists. Many urgent research projects in the Navy and public health sectors cannot be started due to a lack of personnel.

The reason is simple: from 1940 to 1947, scientific research funding increased by 335% of the original amount, while scientific workers increased by only 35%. In fact, if the United States had not had the war, it could have cultivated more than 90,000 scientific bachelors and 5,000 scientific doctorates. More serious in this talent shortage is the insufficient scientific guidance in universities. The number of students has more than doubled compared to wartime, while the number of teachers has only increased by 30%. According to the current trend, at least 15,000 more lecturers are needed. Therefore, this talent shortage will not be eliminated until 1952. It is projected that today's freshman students can directly participate in work at that time.

Overall Plan

Direct overall planning of scientific research work by the government is a first for the United States. Forty-one federal research bureaus will be ordered to engage in different work at the same time, so there will be no duplication or omissions. In the past, the US Navy and Army made mistakes due to a lack of communication planning and unified guidance. Now they can be centralized for division of labor and cooperation.

Another important facility is to expand and enrich these decent laboratories. The plan requires $150 million to equip university laboratories.

Transmitting foreign scientific knowledge to the United States is also an important task. Scientific intelligence stations are set up in embassies stationed in various countries. They must regularly report on all scientific activities in that country, just like reporting on commercial news. Currently, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have such agencies in the United States; and it is particularly important to translate all important scientific papers from the Soviet Union into the United States in a timely manner to exchange new knowledge.

This plan should be the minimum effort for the United States in the next ten years. Other countries have already secretly planned scientific research. The Soviet Union spent as much as $120 million on research in 1947, and they will have 700,000 engineers and scientists working when the five-year plan is completed. At that time, the United States may only have 600,000 students in college. Many countries are moving in this direction. The United Kingdom plans to produce twice as many scientists each year as the previous year; Belgium has increased its research funding by two times; India is focusing on building new laboratories and cultivating scientists to engage in the study of its most appropriate product—atomic bomb raw materials. Based on these facts and reasons, the US government must immediately lead all US scientists to explore greater and more extensive new knowledge.

### Bat Radar

— You Ding

That bats can fly at night, swiftly moving without colliding with obstacles in their path, has long puzzled biologists and even physicists. To understand this mystery, many scientists have captured bats for experiments. They discovered that bats flying indoors could not only avoid walls and furniture, but also spiderwebs. Initially, this was perplexing. Later, they discovered that certain disturbances to their hearing might disrupt their flight, making it difficult for them to clearly avoid obstacles as before.

In 1920, Professor Hartridge suggested that when bats fly in the dark night, it might be because they emit a type of ultra-high-speed sound wave (Super-sonic Sounds) that reflects back to their ears, allowing them to determine the location of obstacles. Twenty years later, the invention of radar and sonar made this clearer, as these two devices are theoretically and practically the same as the aforementioned action of bats, except that bats emit neither electromagnetic waves nor ordinary sound waves. The frequency range of the ultra-high-speed sound waves they emit is 25,000 to 70,000 vibrations per second, while the sound waves that humans can hear have a frequency of only 16 to 3,000 vibrations per second. Therefore, the sound waves emitted by bats actually exceed the limits of human perception.

This theory has experimental basis. Two scholars captured bats and tested them one by one, covering their mouths and noses, leaving only their ears. Removing ____, they could still fly as before. Then, they further used an electronic machine, a high-frequency analyzer, to assist in the experiment. The important part of this analyzer is a ____ receiver, which is extremely sensitive to ultra-high-speed sound waves, and an amplifier that can change the frequency of the sound waves from high to low. Therefore, the analyzer can ____ measure any high-speed sound waves it receives. Using this machine, they found that bats are almost constantly emitting ultra-high-speed sound waves. The frequency varies, of course, but mostly around 50,000 vibrations per second. Under this adjustment, each squeak lasts only one two-hundredth of a second. It has been proven that bats squeak about ten times per second when resting, but this increases to thirty times per second when flapping their wings and flying. When approaching an obstacle, their squeaks suddenly increase to fifty or even sixty times per second, but when the obstacle has passed, the frequency immediately decreases to normal. The "rate" of squeaking naturally changes with the distance to the object because they need to calculate the time of the sound returning from the object.

In addition to the ultra-high-speed sounds that humans cannot hear, bats also emit three other types of sounds, including: a normal sound they make while flying, which Hartridge called a signal tone; a ____ sound that humans can hear when ____ it approaches; and a ____ reply, which can often be heard within a few feet. This "signal tone" varies with the species of bat, while the buzzing sound and the reply are ____ byproducts of ultra-high-speed sound waves. However, the "signal tone" may also be accompanied by ultra-high-speed sound waves. Although it is not known exactly how these four types of sounds are produced, observations and studies of their throats have shown that they are very different from those of ordinary animals. The throats of most animals are made of cartilage, but the throats of bats are made of hard bone, with a huge and strong muscle. The rigidity and small shape of the bat's throat suggest that it is extremely suitable for generating ultra-high-speed sound waves.

Although it is not known how ultra-high-speed sound waves are produced, it is known how bats avoid hearing their own squeaks and only receive the echoes from objects. There is usually a muscle in the bat's ear. As soon as a squeak is emitted, the muscle contracts, trying to prevent the squeak from being heard and only allowing the echo to enter.

Bats are not the only animals that can hear ultra-high-speed sound waves, but bats are currently the only ones discovered that can emit ultra-high-speed sound waves and use their echoes to guide themselves. This is also a miracle of nature.

The African giraffe rarely leaves the forest, has protective coloration, disguising itself like a wall, and its neck grows longer with use, truly living up to its name of seeing far and wide. (Xi)

Scientific Common Sense

### Crabs and Persimmons

— Sun Jialin

"Crabs and persimmons are incompatible; they should not be eaten together." This is a very common saying, and many people firmly believe it. This saying has been around for a long time. Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty said, "They should not be eaten with persimmons; eating them together will cause ____ and wind."

Mr. ____ Ji once experimented using scientific methods. He removed the intestines and stomach of crabs, washed them clean, added salt, and cooked them. Then, he mixed them with an equal amount of persimmons (peeled) and fed them to white mice and dogs for two days. There were no signs of poisoning. Body temperature, stool color, and frequency were observed in detail, and the results were normal, with no signs of illness. (The original experiment can be found in "Science" Volume 24, Issue 7)

The saying about incompatibility probably arose because someone who happened to have eaten crabs and persimmons became ill or died; or they ate too much, exceeding their appetite, and became ill from overeating. They immediately blamed the "incompatibility" of these two foods. In fact, eating too much of any single food can cause illness or even death. Why blame only crabs and persimmons?

### Gospel for the Disabled

— Wan Gongyu

We are about to see ____ using "optical canes." These are used to help blind people ____ sense. A beam of light can accurately detect obstacles within twenty feet.

This device is similar to radar, but uses visible light instead of ____ waves. A nine-pound box, about the size of a loaf of bread, is held in one hand with an earphone.

Trees, people, stairs, and other objects can be heard by the blind. After getting used to the various sounds of different lengths emitted by the instrument, the user can skillfully distinguish the distance of objects.

A new, improved electric arm is powered by batteries and a motor, weighs three pounds, is supported on a crutch, and is rotated by a belt attached to the waist. Within a year, disabled American veterans may have this equipment.

Blind people can use a new aid to help them read. This device can convert the letters printed on paper into clear sounds, allowing the blind to hear them. The blind person points a device resembling a large fountain pen at a word. At the "head" of this pen is a beam of light that is connected to an amplifier tube.

Each letter emits five different sounds, and the reader can hear the sounds through a hearing aid. The total weight of this electronic tube device is only five and a quarter pounds, and it can read all printed letters.

Germans have invented an artificial leg that is controlled by an electric mechanism connected to the damaged nerve endings of the amputated leg. German inventors believe that the small currents flowing in the nerves can provide power and can be controlled by the brain, allowing it to act according to the user's will. This "electric leg" was still in the experimental stage when the war ended. American scientists are somewhat skeptical of the performance of this device but are conducting further research.

Science Ramblings

### Talking About Wood Structure

— Tang Yao

People often ask me, "Which wood is the best in China?" My answer is, "It depends on what you want to use it for." Generally speaking, solid wood is good, but it is not necessarily suitable for all purposes. For example, wood for papermaking should be light in color, light in weight, straight in grain, and light in weight. Commercial wood such as Balsa also has its special uses, such as being used as a float for survival. The lightest paulownia wood produced in our country is used by the Japanese to make clogs. It is planed into thin wood and pasted on paper, called paulownia paper, and used for Christmas greeting cards, which were sold well in the United States before the war. From these examples, we can see that the quality of wood is relative, not absolute. Just like judging a person, we can say that A has these good points and B has these bad points. The nature of a person is the same as that of wood.

Each type of wood has its advantages and disadvantages. Compared with metal materials, wood has the following advantages: (1) lighter in weight; (2) easier to saw and plane; (3) easier to bond or fix with mechanical methods; (4) easier to paint; (5) easier to ____ bond; (6) can absorb ____ east, can withstand considerable pressure and bending; (7) does not easily conduct heat and transmit sound; (8) has beautiful color; (9) easy to float; (10) easy to separate for ____ dimensional raw materials; (11) can be injected with preservatives or other chemicals; (12) expands and contracts less due to temperature differences. Conversely, wood also has its disadvantages, the most ____ obvious of which are: (1) easily affected by external humidity, causing wood to constantly expand and contract, warp, and even crack; (2) extremely variable mechanical strength; (3) has knots and other defects, making it difficult to select materials with the same standards; (4) easily catches fire; (5) easily eroded by fungal and insect pests, leading to decay. Therefore, we must understand its structure and composition in order to use its strengths, avoid its weaknesses, and further improve its weaknesses.

Everyone knows that wood is a complex compound produced by plants. In the plant body, it is used to conduct water, support the whole body, or store food. Different plants have different structures. For example, the wood of pine trees is different from that of nanmu. But in itself, they are all well-matched and best suited for their lives.

But when we cut down trees and supply them for our use, for various purposes, it depends on whether we can fully "use materials according to their properties."

Wood is produced by plants; plants are living things, so wood, unlike copper and iron, is affected by the external environment throughout its growth process: for example, the soil, rainfall, temperature, and other climate change factors, the erosion of insect pests and diseases, the density of growth, and even the scientific management of forests, can all affect the final product of the wood. These environmental changes are recorded on the wood, and we can indirectly infer them from the density of the growth rings on the cross-section of the wood or the growth bands on the longitudinal section, the amount of ____ wood (Late Wood Band) in each growth ring, and the thickness of the cell wall (Cell Wall) of the wood cells, and even the number of various cells that make up the wood.

The structure of various woods is quite different; even the same tree species can vary greatly due to different growing locations. Even the same tree species growing in the same place, the roots or base, branches, and the trunk, as well as wood at different heights and different radial distances, are different. Moreover, the degree of these differences may be greater in the same tree species than in different species. Therefore, all these things make this organic wood extremely variable (Variability), causing great difficulties in its use and material property research.

Anyone who knows a little about botany knows that wood is not a solid thing like copper, iron, or cement, but is made up of specialized "tracheary elements or tubular fiber-units or cells" glued together. ____ This specialized cell is mainly used to conduct water in the plant body: it transports the water and inorganic salts absorbed by the roots to the ____ for food production.

If you look at the cross-section of wood under a microscope, it is like a honeycomb. Each tube is empty; in professional terms, the former is called the "cell wall" and the latter is called the "cell cavity" (Cell Cavity). On the adjacent cell walls, there are many small holes or pits, allowing the trees to be well connected during growth; these unthickened cell walls are called "pits" (Pit). The tubular cells in wood can be roughly divided into two categories: one is a non-open tube, connected up and down, like bamboo stalks are composed of sections; but wood is not as neat as that. This type of cell is called "tracheid" (Tracheid), which constitutes the main body of coniferous (Conifers or Coniferae) wood (only three genera of gymnosperms in the world do not have tracheids). Its length averages about 2-4 hao m.m. Its adjacent wall (referring to the cell walls adjacent to the left and right) has bordered pits (Bordered pit). There is also a type of "tubular cell" whose bottom wall is partially or completely missing, forming a vertically connected series of cells, fused to form a tubular structure of indefinite length; their adjacent walls also have bordered pits. The average length of this type of cell is less than one hao, and it is called "vessel," which is unique to various ____ materials (Broaded Leafep Tress) such as poplar and ____ wood (only four genera of ____ materials in the world do not have vessels). Therefore, these two types of cells are very important to the properties of wood.

Speaking of coniferous and ____ materials, there are two fairly common commercial terms that can be introduced. Generally, "softwoods" (Softwoods) are pine, cypress, and cedar. ____ The wood of trees is usually called "hardwoods" (Hardwoods), such as poplar, cypress, and ____ wood. These two terms are commonly used in various countries and are completely equivalent to coniferous or ____ materials in botany. Their meaning only represents two major categories of wood and has nothing to do with the weight of the wood. For example, hemlock, this kind of ____ material, is much heavier and harder than poplar.

### Looking From the Side

— Wang Pingling

People with eyes must use their eyes more. What comes in through the ears can only be used as a reference for the eyes, unless they are blind, relying solely on unreliable ears.

Those who can use their eyes not only doubt their own ears but also do not overly trust their own "naked eyes." They are never satisfied with recognizing the shapes and colors before them. They put on telescopes to see the distant future from the present, and use microscopes to uncover invisible secrets. When a person can stand at the correct angle and see the causes and consequences of things clearly, no matter how bizarre the changes before them, they will not panic and lose their composure. However, those who are innately nearsighted and groping in the dark, even if what lies before them is not a trap, without any obstacles, but a wide open road, dare not take bold steps. Such a life is indeed painful.

Living in this world, one must never stare directly at reality. Staring directly at reality often results from overusing one's eyes, seeing more and more vaguely, and even being enveloped by reality, becoming a part of reality. How about resolutely extracting oneself from the shroud of reality, waving one's sleeves, brushing off the red dust from one's body, and quietly hiding on the side of super interest, looking at reality from the side. Perhaps one can recognize reality and find many undiscovered secrets.

Today, people deeply hate corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods, and have no good feelings for them! Not only that, even those who eat ____ country accumulation, when their conscience is awakened in the morning, must deeply feel guilty, admitting that their sins are heavy and will not disappear on their own, but will bring disaster to the people. However, this extreme argument sometimes lacks moderation and cannot forcibly find useful qualities in useless waste to comfort oneself. Looking at it from the front, the means of corruption and hoarding can certainly harm the country and endanger the people, leading everyone to live a life like years, unsure of the next day; but looking at it from the side, the means of corruption and hoarding are originally a shortcut for Chinese people to get rich. Those who have become rich because of it certainly have self-awareness. All who eat the produce of the land want to get rich, and if they have actually pioneered such a shortcut, then the means of eating ____ and hoarding, although opposed by the majority of suffering people, will undoubtedly be supported by the minority who benefit endlessly.

The US Congress calls clearing up official corruption cases "muckraking." This means that without corrupt officials who create ____, there is no need to rely on muckraking scavengers. Since corrupt hoarders are everywhere, and the muckraking scavengers, for the sake of factual needs, cannot but increase. In addition to extra, various extra titles are added to engage in the work of clearing up corruption and hoarding. Looking at it from the front, the means of corrupting the country are ____; but looking at it from the side, because of the efforts of some people to create ____, achieving brilliant achievements, it also undoubtedly allows some other people to obtain job security. Precisely because more and more ____ is being raked up, the task of muckraking is even more given the meaning of the times. If there were a day when corruption was completely eliminated, those scavengers who specialize in raking ____ for a living would only have to announce their retirement. I think this unemployment problem is also quite serious. Therefore, in all things, one must never stare directly at reality, but should look at it from all sides. If you cannot see it from the front, look at it from the opposite side, from the side. You will know that darkness is the foil of light, that ____ is the emphasis of fragrance. The Creator creates all things, each with its own mystery, and we ordinary people really have no need to waste our brains, sighing and lamenting!

### Research on "Miss"

— Juan

Today, people respectfully address young women as "Miss." According to Qian Weiyan's "Jade Hall Fengchenlu," "Miss Han, a palace maid in charge of tea and wine," the word "Miss" first appeared here. However, it is still a person's name, not a title, so it is not seen in poetry. Since the Ming Dynasty, there has been a line "Three inches of arched shoes are revealed in front of the curtain, knowing that a graceful Miss is coming." The word "Miss" first appeared in poetry.

### Crisis

— Zeng Shen

A French painter, while drinking in a hotel, accidentally saw a newspaper left by someone on the floor. The headline on the newspaper was: "Economic crisis is coming."

When he finished drinking one glass of wine and the waiter asked him if he wanted another, he refused because "the economic crisis is coming."

The hotel owner called out: "Is the economic crisis coming? Then my wife's new coat should not be made." So he went to tell the owner of the fashion company.

The owner of the fashion company said: "Is the economic crisis coming? Then our company should not renovate the facade." So he went to tell the owner of the construction company.

The owner of the construction company ____ed a sigh: "Is the economic crisis coming? Then my wife should not pay a high price to have a painter make a portrait."

The painter received a letter from the owner of the construction company canceling the portrait appointment. Naturally unhappy, he went to the hotel to drink again. The hotel owner was lethargic these days and even too lazy to have the waiters clean up the hall. The newspaper that the painter had seen a few days ago was still on the floor. He read the headline news again. But when he looked at the date of the newspaper again, he couldn't help but call out—it turned out to be a ____ newspaper from two years ago!

### Remembering the New Yorker

— Lei Hong

During the war, we generally felt a magazine shortage. Both Chinese and Western magazines were declining, especially Western magazines. Apart from the machine Bank Copy, there were simply no new ones.

Since last year, Western magazines ____ have poured into Shanghai, allowing us to broaden our horizons again. Among them, several magazines are expired overseas military editions, which are still fresh to those who have not been to the mainland, so overseas editions of magazines sell very well in Shanghai. For example, "The New Yorker" is one of the overseas editions. The format is half the size of the normal one, the text content is exactly the same, only the advertisements are missing, and the font size is halved.

After the overseas edition was cut off, ordinary magazines were imported, but only "The New Yorker" has not been seen with new arrivals until now. Why is it that in today's situation where all kinds of magazines ____ are coming, only this "New Yorker" magazine, which sells very widely and has very popular text content, does not descend on Shanghai. It is really a mystery.

"The New Yorker" is a humorous and serious general reading material. The opening "comments" are humorous and scolding, bizarre and grotesque. Although they reflect a society in New York, they are something that people all over the world like to know a little secret about. Later novels, features, book reviews, movie introductions, and character descriptions all maintain the unique style of "The New Yorker." Even the comics and black and white illustrations at the beginning of the book represent the personality of "The New Yorker." Not only are they their characteristics, but they have also influenced other publications to adopt the same style of comics.

The English Da Mei Evening News sometimes reprints articles from "The New Yorker," allowing us to get a glimpse of them, which makes us even more miss this magazine, which is so good and full of intimate words.

### The "Uselessness" of "Pen Tips"

— Yi Feng

Han Shi Wai Zhuan says: "A gentleman avoids three ends: the sharp end of a warrior, the ancient end of a debater, and the pen tip of a literati." Among these three, the "pen tip" was considered the most powerful by the ancients. The so-called "Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, and rebellious ministers and traitors feared." Why? Because "the punishment of a word is more severe than an axe" is also true.

However, even so, the rebellious ministers and traitors of each dynasty still followed one after another, rising up in every generation. It can also be seen that the "pen tip" is not necessarily really that scary. What is the reason for this? I think it is because many literati who have written books and said things since Confucius have devolved into "being used" or "having literature without action."

Confucius' attitude towards learning and being a person was very serious. If "the way is not practiced," he would rather "ride a raft and float on the sea," and would never be careless. Therefore, the Spring and Autumn Annals he wrote became a great cause of "ice and frost in one sentence, axes for thousands of years." This is something that ordinary literati who are "used" or "have literature without action" cannot even hope to achieve. Therefore, the power of the "pen tip" has become more and more useless.

For example, ____ Wang Yanzhang, although listed in the famous literary circle, was a Tingnan lyricist ____, but judging from his flattery and slander of Li Gang, he was contradictory before and after, and fickle, which will also prove that he is just a small person who "plays with words" and has no backbone. In his article congratulating Li Gang on becoming Right Chancellor, he wrote: "Utmost loyalty penetrates the sun, in the midst of overturning the two ____; heroic spirit traverses autumn, laughing at ten thousand ____. Having a high reputation and charming the crowd, yet ____ and personally endangered. Scholars complained of public injustices, quickly raising banners and gathering under the palace gate; the emperor followed the people's wishes, ordering him to be spared from the stomach to see the people of the country." His praise for Li can be said to be exhaustive. Later, Li was falsely accused by Zhang Jun and dismissed. Yanjun then drafted an edict saying: "Associates with evil to deceive the emperor, those with ____ must be removed from Huan Dou; deceiving the world and stealing fame, Confucius first beheaded Zheng Mao. Special killing still threatens, harming the virtuous of the holy emperors; valuing slander and liking flattery, being the clan of a group of small people for a time." They belonged to the same person before and after, and their fickleness was so great. Of course, such a "pen tip" could not play a big role. If he falsely accused good people in this way, and then turned to "rebellious ministers and traitors," then "rebellious ministers and traitors" would not only laugh secretly to themselves, but would also "use the shield of the son to attack the spear of the son," exposing their faces to the other party!

Naturally, there are as many people like Wang Yanzhang in every dynasty as there are "grains of sand in the Ganges." After the early years of the Republic of China, the warlords stole the country, and the "gun tip" raised its head greatly. With this trend, the "pen tip" naturally went down like the sun setting in the river. The "pen tip," one of the three ends that the ancients said should be avoided, has now become a useless waste. Is it not appropriate!

### Balushu's Humor

— Italian Meaning

Former Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Balushu, once invited a friend to his country villa for a hunt. That friend was determined to shoot a few ducks, but he used up a lot of bullets without success. Balushu saw that his skills were not very good, but naturally it was not appropriate to criticize him.

The friend was leaving the day before his departure. His hunting enthusiasm was still undiminished. He walked into the woods and saw a large wild duck perched on a branch. He quickly and quietly approached, aimed carefully, and with a "bang," the duck fell to the ground!

He was overjoyed and quickly bent down to pick it up, but upon closer inspection, he saw a note on the duck's neck, which read, "Respectfully presented by Balushu."

### Watching "British Landscape"

— Wen Zhaotong

With the rise of the petty bourgeoisie, landscape painting in Europe flourished from the Netherlands around the seventeenth century. However, it was in the work of British painters that one saw the most unusual and beautiful things in this area.

Of course, the development of landscape painting is undoubtedly related to the aversion to scientific life and the longing for pastoral life. Therefore, the industrial revolution was first completed in Britain, and landscape painting flourished in Britain, there is no doubt about that.

Recently, the British Council held a "British Landscape Exhibition" at the Da Xin Art Gallery, displaying fifty reproductions of colored landscape paintings and photographs for the Shanghai public to view. We can certainly feast our eyes on the beautiful scenery of the island, but from the perspective of art appreciation, these twenty-nine colored reproductions of landscape paintings are worth paying attention to.

The world-renowned British painters, Turner and Constable, are the two masters of naturalism. Their landscape paintings had a huge impact on the color and light of Impressionist painting at the end of the nineteenth century. Turner's colors are bright and beautiful; Constable's sunlight is brilliant and pleasing to the eye. In this exhibition, the former has a total of four works, and No. 14 "Crossing the Creek" can be regarded as representative of his style. The others are just watercolor studies. The latter has only one work, No. 13 "Landscape." The arrangement of light and shadow is appropriate, worthy of a masterpiece.

The earlier masters, Gainsborough, Sandby, and Calmen, also have many works included. Although it is impossible to see the entire history of British landscape painting, one can get a glimpse of it.

British landscape painting, especially watercolor painting, seems to have a traditional form. In this exhibition, the works of Pliot and Hunt can be said to be completely conservative in this tradition. However, the style of Cezanne at the end of the nineteenth century, as well as the so-called emerging schools such as New Objectivity, have also entered the conservative British art scene. The expression of the blocks in the painting No. 17 Dukes Dairy (by E. White) undoubtedly inherited Cezanne's technique. However, the emerging schools have after all developed on the European continent. Across the sea, the works of British artists such as Nash and Nevioson have been baptized by the Parisian style, but upon closer examination, their expressive power is still not full and strong enough.

It has been a long time since I have been exposed to the taste of European art. Watching British landscape paintings is indeed of endless interest.

### Method of Washing Away a Bad Name

— Ye

The Ga-Fei tribe of South Africa has a way to wash away the bad name of a criminal. They take a teapot full of boiling water, shout the name of the criminal loudly at the spout, and quickly cover it with a lid. After letting the bad name "soak" in the teapot for many days, the criminal's reputation is considered clean again.

### Illustrated Chongqing Storytelling No. 2: The Painters of Liangshan Marsh

— Bai Wuwen, Painting by Gao Longsheng

A college student in Shanghai found 15,000 yuan on a rickshaw. A professor in Xi'an became a thief, and when it was published in the newspaper, it was mostly labeled with the title "The Intellectuals' Decorum has Fallen to the Ground." In fact, the intellectuals who have fallen to the ground have long become "dog bites man" news (in a fine arts school in Chongqing, there was a dean of studies who stole a colleague's old overcoat to get a full meal).

In Yunnan, a middle school art teacher made a mistake in a painting of a bulletin board heading for students. This is not surprising, but what is strange is that he said: I don't have to worry about rice and firewood every day, and the students don't have to be shocked for me. I am getting benevolence without seeking it.

During the war, the largest market for painters was Zigong in Sichuan, which produced salt, and Neijiang, which produced sugar. Generally, holding exhibitions there would allow them to eat for half a year or three months, because there were plenty of rich people there, and the rich people were willing to sell face and make friends with some elegant friends to dilute the smell of money.

But now, when a painter's paintings are sent, they only get rejection slips.

Some time ago, a fine arts professor in Chongqing took his proud work to the door of a wealthy friend to sell it. The doorman went in to show it. The painting was returned, but the painter was given 10,000 yuan. It was simply not only treating him as a beggar who begged for food, but also a beggar who spent his travel expenses. The professor didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

In Water Margin, the great thieves, the sacred-handed scholar Xiao Rang and the jade-armed ape Jin Dajian, one was a calligrapher and the other was a epigraphist. Unexpectedly, today they were discovered in "Liangshan" not far from Chongqing. Among a group of bandits, a deputy leader was Chen, who studied painting in France.

The desire for survival is compressed to a limited extent. Once this limit is exceeded, one hand holding a painting and the other holding a gun may happen one day. "The tip of the pen sweeps across thousands of people" is Wang Shifu's boasting, but the tip of the gun sweeping across one person is not a ridiculous dream.

Chapter 2: A Gentle Conversation (8)

Qi Wan paused and then said: "I cried when I heard this, but the two teachers were determined to resign and could not be persuaded to stay. This was entirely because my brother offended them with a few words. If they don't teach me opera, what hope do I have for the future! I just cry every day, blaming my brother for being wrong. My father advocated that I no longer need to learn opera. As a scholarly family, a girl should go to school and study. I said that I have already learned opera. If I hold books and study again, I won't be able to study. I cried every day. My father scolded me whenever he saw me. The father and daughter often quarreled over disagreements. When my brother saw that my father was angry with me every day, he let me move out and live at No. 12."

When Qi Wan said this, she was very touched and paused again. After listening, Zhu Zhai felt that a weak woman struggled so hard for art and suffered all kinds of obstacles, and expressed great sympathy in his heart, and said: "So that's how it is. Boss Gu, you are also considered unfortunate to have suffered so much for learning opera." Qi Wan said sadly: "I can only blame my bad luck. "As she spoke, she picked up the teacup on the coffee table, took a sip, and continued: "In my boredom, I finally met an opportunity, the Tianjin Theater sent someone to invite me and my brother to Tianjin to play the leading role. My brother has already agreed, but I don't know why, he doesn't want to go. How can a girl go out alone! I was so anxious that I had to ask Master Zhu for help. Master Zhu refused. I pleaded again and again, saying: Master, since you love me so much, you still have to love me as before. I almost cried when I said it. Master Zhu was also very sad. He said it's a pity you are not a boy. If you were a boy, I would go all out to help you. Your father and brother are not easy to deal with. This time, for the sake of your future, I can't help but accompany you to Tianjin once, but this cannot be an example in the future." This difficult time was all thanks to Master Zhu's enthusiastic help, which got me through. When I returned from Tianjin, Master Zhu thought that since I was playing the leading role in Tianjin, it would hinder my future if I continued to play supporting roles and let others take the credit. In Beiping, I had to continue to play the leading role and sang a few shows boldly, all of which were sold out. From that time until now, I have officially lived a stage life. I am now learning the complete Wang Chun'e, as well as revising a few operas such as "Yang Guifei" and "Yu Tangchun." Every afternoon when I have time, I go to Master Zhu's house to learn opera and practice my skills."

Zhu Zhai said: "Now that Boss Gu has become famous, the old man must be very satisfied." Qi Wan said: "No, my father has a bad temper and has been ill recently. He is still dissatisfied with me. I also feel that my art is still very immature and far from success." Zhu Zhai said: "You are too polite. I would be satisfied if I could sing one or two percent as well as you." Qi Wan said: "Don't say that." Just as she was about to say this, Xiao Wang's mother brought in cocoa and snacks. Qi Wan instructed everyone to eat some snacks while asking: "Mr. Xu, can you also tell me about your opera learning process?" Zhu Zhai said shyly: "I'm completely fooling around. I haven't formally studied under a teacher. Boss Fei is my uncle-in-law. I often go to his house. He sometimes tells me a few things, but it's a pity that he is a Sheng, and my voice is not suitable for singing Sheng." Qi Wan said: "It's very rare to be able to do this. Your voice is really good. If you study further, you will definitely become famous. But you don't need this. Do you work in an organization now?" Zhu Zhai said: "The business office of the Guogao Bank." Qi Wan said: "Who is in your family?" Zhu Zhai said: "My parents and my wife." After hearing this, Qi Wan looked at the lamp again, stared at it for a while, and then said: "Your wife must be very beautiful, right?" Just as Zhu Zhai was about to speak, he saw Xiao Wang's mother nudging Qi Wan slightly, wanting to ask her to leave. Qi Wan sat still and asked, "What's the matter? Tell me." Xiao Wang's mother said: "Director Lin has called twice in a row. I told him that you were not at home. Now he has sent a car to pick you up, saying that if you don't go, Director Lin will come in person." After hearing this, Qi Wan frowned and tapped the ground with the heel of her high-heeled shoe, saying: "I owe him money, let's go!" (End of Chapter Six)

Reader Consultation Legal Explanation Refusal to Return Overdue for Three Years Despotic Local Tyrant Wields Power

Zhang Jinyi asks: In the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, my hometown fell and the enemy puppets were rampant. My late father was kidnapped because he had a slight reputation and was extorted for a large sum of money. Because it was impossible to raise the money at the time, he mortgaged ten mu of ancestral farmland to Shao, a fellow villager, for 4,400 yuan (puppet currency), with a term of three years. When the term expired, my late father asked someone to try to redeem it, but Shao refused on various pretexts. Last year, my father passed away and the family's economic situation became even more difficult. My mother asked someone to build up Shao again to redeem the land with three shi of white rice, but Shao relied on local power to insist that he would only consider it if he got fifteen shi of white rice. After the township head mediated, it was agreed to redeem it with six shi of white rice, but this number was still extremely considerable, resulting in a stalemate. There are several legal questions. I hope your lawyer can take the time to answer them so that I can follow them: Since the mortgage certificate was valued in currency (puppet currency) at the time, can it still be redeemed at the original price? If the number of shi is converted based on the grain price at that time, is there any legal basis? Does the government have any explicit provisions for the disposal of mortgages during the enemy puppet period? Now that it has been overdue for three years, can Shao be pursued for losses during the period of "refusal to redeem"? Is there any agency responsible for mediating this farmland mortgage dispute?

[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin answers] You can redeem it according to the mortgage price on the certificate. There is no legal basis. There is only the promulgation of supplementary regulations for handling civil lawsuits after the restoration. The provisions of Article 12 of the regulations only state that the court should fairly measure the judgment of increasing or decreasing the payment or changing other original effects, but there is no express provision for increasing by a certain number of times. The court often orders repayment at one or two thousand times. If the mortgagee refuses to redeem after the expiration date, the collected rent can be requested to be returned as unjust enrichment, but it cannot be converted into a mortgage price. Directly file a lawsuit with the judicial organ.
