In addition, the fighting at Maozi in the northeast of Dakou and at the Niangniang Temple in the northwest is also fierce.

However, they have suffered a major blow from the National troops, and the Communist 4th and 5th Columns have suffered heavy losses.

[Report from Xuzhou by this Newspaper, 26th] The offensive and defensive battle at Tai'an and Dakou in the central section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is fierce.

The remnants of the Communist troops fled westward to Old Town. In addition, the main force of the Communist troops attacking Tai'an engaged in battle with the defending troops in the suburbs on the morning of the 26th.

Another contingent of National troops recovered Huangya Mountain on the afternoon of the 25th.

[Report from Jinan by this Newspaper, 26th] The all-out offensive launched by the Communist troops towards western Shandong has now officially begun.

Since the evening of the 25th, the Communist 3rd Column, which had originally fled to the area west of Tai'an, namely the Yuchi area, and its 7th Division, have continued to advance on Feicheng. At the same time, a unit of the Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, which had been lying dormant among the people, also launched a fierce attack on Dong'a City.

The National troops advancing towards Mount Culai, south of Tai'an and north of Sishui, have advanced to the line near Old Town and Loude, and are engaging in fierce fighting with the Communist troops. This line of National troops has posed a great threat to the flank of the Communist troops besieging Tai'an.

[Report from Jinan by this Newspaper, 25th] The headquarters of the Communist Shandong Field Army has set up a command post in Xintai, personally commanded by Deputy Commander Piao Yu, and has set a deadline of five days to capture Tai'an.

### Captured American Officer Says He Almost Faced Execution by the Chinese Communists

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] U.S. Assistant Military Attach√© Major Rigg and Captain Collins, in a press conference, recounted their experiences after being detained by the Chinese Communists, stating: During our detention, we learned that the Chinese Communists in the Northeast would hold a "People's Court" to try us for espionage and sentence us to death. It was not until Zhu De telegraphed Li Lisan on April 9, ordering our release, that we were spared this fate. For the first 35 days, we were repeatedly interrogated, with attempts to coerce and beat us into confessing that we were engaged in espionage for the National Army. After receiving Zhu De's order for our release on April 9, our treatment began to improve, and we were allowed to visit Harbin or go shopping on the streets. However, the Chinese Communist army treated us as prisoners of war and did not recognize our status as diplomats. The Chinese Communists in Harbin threatened us three times, claiming they would torture us and that this torture was permitted by international law, but we never believed this, and their threats did not cause us any serious concern.

Rigg also stated that he and Collins, along with a Chinese translator and driver, decided to go to the front lines of Changchun when they heard of Communist troop activity 13 miles outside Changchun, as he was very concerned about his family residing there. They rushed to the front lines, but before they could reach three miles, they saw two sentries. The translator was startled and tried to flee back to the jeep, but was shot by machine guns. Collins was hit head-on, but luckily fell into a ditch and was spared. They were then disarmed and taken to the command post.

They arrived in Harbin on March 6, and the Chinese Communists immediately informed them that they were prisoners of war, and they were immediately imprisoned and their belongings were taken away. On the evening of March 6, Collins was first questioned by the "so-called court," and he was subjected to the same questioning the following night, both being accused of "assisting the Kuomintang." It was not until March 9 that Li Lisan invited them to Li's residence for a meal and issued Zhu De's order for their release.

During their captivity, they enjoyed two Western meals a day, and the place they were living in had heating facilities, and they slept on plank beds with straw mats. The Communist army also provided toiletries. They spent most of their time reading books and newspapers and writing protests. The Chinese Communists provided them with two English Communist books, namely "Red Star Over China" and "China's Angry Roar."

### Review and Approval Process of the International Labour Organization Constitution Amendment in Our Country

[Report from Nanjing by this Newspaper, 26th] The amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization and the Convention on Amendments to Final Provisions have been approved by the 323rd Regular Meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 24th of this month: It has been passed according to the review opinions of the Labour Law Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee and approved. The situation regarding the amendment to the Constitution and the review and approval process in our country is explained as follows:

The International Labour Organization was originally one of the organizations of the old League of Nations. The Constitution of the International Labour Organization involves many aspects of the League of Nations. After the end of World War II, due to the emergence of the United Nations and the dissolution of the League of Nations, the International Labour Organization separated from the League of Nations and established relations with the United Nations. Its original Constitution therefore needed to be amended. On November 5, 1945, the 27th International Labour Conference passed the draft amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization, amending the relevant provisions on three key points: the issue of member states of the organization listed in the original Constitution, fiscal budget measures, and the procedure for amending the Constitution. In addition, the relevant provisions involving the Secretary-General of the League of Nations or involving regulations related to the international community in the various conventions passed before the Constitution of the International Labour Organization was amended and the 28th International Labour Conference were also subject to concurrent amendments. The above amendments and conventions were submitted to the 29th International Labour Conference for further discussion and passage in accordance with the key points of the amendments passed by the 27th International Labour Conference and the constitutions that have been ratified by the member states. Our country is one of the eight major permanent directors of the International Labour Organization and has dispatched government representatives to attend the Working Group on Constitutional Issues and the 29th International Labour Conference. All of the aforementioned amendments and conventions were submitted by the Ministry of Social Affairs to the Executive Yuan, which then transferred them to the Legislative Yuan. After the Labour Law Committee, together with the Foreign Affairs Committee, reviewed them, they were submitted to the 323rd meeting of the Legislative Yuan for resolution and approval. Thus, the legislative procedure has been completed, and the amendment and the Convention on Amendments to Final Provisions will take effect. The original text of the amendment is copied below:

"Amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization": The General Conference of the International Labour Organization, convened by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office, held its 29th Session in Montreal on September 19, 1946. The Conference, having considered the question of the amendment of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization, which is the second item on the agenda of the Session, having taken note of the various proposals made in this connection, decides to adopt them, and hereby, this ninth day of October, nineteen hundred and forty-six, passes the following amendment to the Constitution of the International Labour Organization. That is, the amendment may be referred to as the International Labour Organization Constitution Amendment of 1946.

Article 1 The Constitution of the International Labour Organization whose current provisions are contained in the first line of the unamended annex shall, from the date on which this amendment begins to take effect, take effect in accordance with the amendment method contained in the second line of the annex.

Article 2 Two copies of the model of this amendment shall be signed by the President of the Conference and the Director-General of the International Labour Office, one of which shall be kept in the files of the International Labour Office, and the other shall be sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for registration in accordance with Article 102 of the Charter of the United Nations. The Director-General shall also distribute the corrected version of this amendment to the member states of the International Labour Organization.

Article 3 (1) All formal instruments of ratification or acceptance of this amendment shall be sent to the Director-General of the International Labour Office for notification to the member states of the International Labour Organization. (2) This amendment shall come into force in accordance with the provisions of Article 36 of the Constitution of the International Labour Organization. (3) Once this amendment begins to take effect, the Director-General of the International Labour Office shall immediately notify the member states of the International Labour Organization, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the countries that signed the Charter of the United Nations.

### U.S. Position Unchanged on the $500 Million Loan to China; Ambassador Says He Will Help Our Country in a Convenient Way; We Will Issue New Currency After the Loan is Successful

[Report from Nanjing by this Newspaper, 26th] Ambassador Stuart Lei Den, in response to reporters' questions on the U.S. loan to China on the evening of the 26th, said: "I cannot tell you, but the United States will definitely help China in a convenient way." When reporters asked for his thoughts on the reorganization of our government, the ambassador said "very good." The ambassador also told reporters that he may travel to Qingdao soon, and the original plan to go to Hankou has been canceled due to the bad weather.

[Report from Nanjing by this Newspaper, 26th] It is rumored that after the loan is successful, the new currency will be issued, and the currency will be linked to international currency (i.e., the U.S. dollar).

[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] A report said that China has ordered machinery under the $500 million loan. When reporters inquired to a senior official of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, he replied: The U.S. has not taken steps to disburse the $500 million loan. The cutoff date for this loan is June 30, which is the end of this fiscal year. A spokesperson for the State Department made a statement on the 1st of this month, saying that the State Department's position has not changed. The spokesperson said that before disbursing the loan, China should have the following conditions: (1) China should propose various suggestions, (2) The suggestion should be approved by the State Department, (3) It must be approved by the Export-Import Bank. At that time, the spokesperson emphasized that the Chinese side is well aware of the conditions that China must have domestically in order to obtain the loan, and said that since President Truman outlined these conditions in September last year, the United States' policy has not changed in this regard.

The U.S. government is currently proposing to hold a Sino-U.S. liquidation meeting in Washington for various items under the Lend-Lease and Reverse Lend-Lease cases and loan materials. There is still a distance between the two sides. Since the news released by the United Press is not a formal announcement document of the U.S. government, the Chinese government does not intend to make any formal statement and will formally propose liquidation at the Washington liquidation meeting.

### Nine Years of Blood Debt Now Repaid; Tani Hisao Executed by Firing Squad; More Than 10,000 Spectators Cheer at Yuhuatai

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Tani Hisao, the main culprit in the Nanjing Massacre, was executed by firing squad at 11:50 AM on the 26th in Nanjing, killed by a single shot. The National Government Chairman's approval order was delivered to the Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense on the 25th. At 9:45 AM on the 26th, Prosecutor Chen Guangyu brought Tani from the war criminal detention center for a final interrogation and announced his death sentence. When Tani was escorted to the execution site, his complexion was as before. He was wearing a yellow military uniform and black velvet cotton shoes, without a hat, and his gait was slightly unsteady. As per routine, his age and origin were questioned, and then three sets of family letters were given to Tani to read. At the time, Tani still did not know that his death was imminent. He hastily read them and put them in his pocket. When the prosecutor asked if he needed to write back, he seemed to understand a little and wrote letters on the spot to his wife, son, and grandson, sighing all the while, for about a quarter of an hour. Then, the prosecutor read aloud the Chairman's telegram on the spot (attached below), and continued: "The trial and judgment of your case are very accurate and fair because you not only ordered the massacre in the Zhonghuamen area, but also went to various places in the city to massacre. You must be very clear about this. Other matters, such as the Nanjing Massacre and the killing contest, were published in large articles in Japanese newspapers, so there is no need to argue. Therefore, today's execution is very fair." Hearing this, Tani still made a final sophistry, saying, "Apart from participating in the entrance ceremony, I did not go to the city. Until this moment, I still hope that the court can clarify the whole case before making a decision, otherwise it will regret it in the future." The prosecutor said, "I have no authority other than to execute. Do you have any instructions for your family and after your death?" Tani spoke quickly, looking at the ground, and strongly claimed: "The defendant has nothing to do with this case. The defendant now believes that it will definitely be clarified in the future. I hope that this judgment will not affect future Sino-Japanese relations and that the court will pay attention to the defendant's witnesses in future trials." Finally, Tani asked to write a will to his wife. At that time, Tani's voice was trembling and his body was shaking, with tears in his eyes. Warden Yang of the detention center gave him a cigarette to smoke. He wrote and smoked until 10:45 AM, and then took out his belongings and asked them to be handed over. He was very careful when sorting out the items, and he could not find a watch he had left behind, as if he still had regrets. At 11:10 AM, he finished sorting out and announced the adjournment of the court. Tani was escorted onto the prison van. The presiding judge and prosecutor, etc., all went to the execution ground in person in many cars. Citizens along the way, upon hearing that Tani was being executed, were overjoyed and followed the van. Before reaching Zhonghuamen, the crowd was already lining the streets. By the time they reached Yuhuatai, the mountains and valleys were full of people, cheering. After nine years of blood debt, they were finally able to have their revenge. At 11:45 AM, the van arrived at the execution ground. Tani was escorted down from the van. Except for his unsteady gait, he showed no other changes. At 11:50 AM sharp, the execution began. Prosecutor Chen gave the order, and Hong Ergen executed the shot. A single shot entered from the back of the head and exited from the mouth, exposing the gums. Tani took the bullet and immediately fell backward, dying silently. At that time, more than 10,000 spectators around cheered thunderously. This former demon king who rampaged on Zijin Mountain was now brought to justice at Yuhuatai, which was an unparalleled comfort for the millions of citizens of Nanjing.

Chairman's Telegram Approving Execution

The original text of the Chairman's telegram is recorded as follows: "According to the case presented by Chief Judge Shi: I have read the presentation and documents of this court on March 19 of this year. After investigation, the defendant Tani Hisao jointly ordered the troops to massacre prisoners and non-combatants during the war, and committed rape, robbery, and destruction of property. Since the interrogation has proven this clearly, the original sentence of death is appropriate and should be approved. As for the defendant's reasons for requesting a retrial, they do not comply with the provisions of Article 45 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Trial Law and should be rejected. I hope you will comply with the execution and report the execution date for verification. The judgment shall be kept in the case file and returned, Zhongzheng."

Military Tribunal Announces Crimes

The Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense announced Tani's crimes as follows:

After investigation, the war criminal Tani Hisao jointly ordered the troops to massacre prisoners and non-combatants during the war in Nanjing, and committed rape, robbery, and destruction of property. The evidence is conclusive. This court has already sentenced him to death on March 10 of this year, in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 2, Article 23, Paragraph 3, Paragraph 7, Article 28, Article 46, and Article 47 of the Hague Regulations Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land, Article 2 and Article 3 of the Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Article 1, Article 2, Paragraph 2, Article 3, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 4, Paragraph 24, Paragraph 27, and Article 11 of the War Criminals Trial Regulations, and reported it to Chief of Staff Chen, and then to the Chairman of the National Government Jiang, who approved the execution by telegram on April 25 of this year. In compliance with the order, at 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month, the prosecutor of this court brought the war criminal Tani Hisao, verified his identity, and escorted him to the Yuhuatai execution ground to carry out the death penalty according to law. War criminal Tani Hisao, male, 66 years old, Japanese, residing at 53 Fujimicho, Nakanoku, Tokyo, Japan, Lieutenant General of the Japanese Army Division Commander.

Tani's Will to His Wife, Umeko

The translated text of Tani Hisao's will to his wife Umeko is as follows: "April 26, Showa 23 (1948), my death sentence has been carried out! Before knowing about the execution, I gave you another letter, and this pair of wills, as a memorial for our eternal farewell. Umeko, you have fulfilled your responsibility as a supportive wife, and I want to thank you deeply here. I am being executed now due to the erroneous judgment of the Chinese side, which is truly regrettable. I am confident that one day it will be made clear whether I have committed international crimes. But I alone do not matter. I am finally dying in Yuhuatai, which is ultimately serving my country. I have no emotional struggles. Please help them. Please nurture Kiyoko and Hideko to become useful people. Although my body will turn to ash in a foreign land, my soul will ultimately return to you. It is now noon on April 26th. After saying goodbye to you, I will be gone forever. I hope everyone can be happy. I can still stand and say goodbye to everyone, but in a moment, I will fall down forever. This is unfortunate, but it is also fate. I am a man, and dying for my country is something to be satisfied with. I have completed the journey of life. Lieutenant General Takahashi and Staff Officer SoÁ¨†Âé• personally witnessed my final form. They can tell you that everything is fate. Sixty-six years old has become the last year of my life. Until my death, I believed that I was not wrong and tried my best to the very end, but I was ultimately shot, which is truly regrettable. My dearest Umeko, farewell forever. Please cremate my remains and take the ashes back. I am not afraid. I wish my family happiness. My thoughts and Umeko's thoughts are completely aligned. I pray to the heavens for Umeko's longevity. Farewell forever!"

### Editorial: Countermeasures to Suppress Rice Prices

The food problem for the people has indeed become very serious recently. Although the authorities have repeatedly tried to lower prices and have been selling off rice for days, the market still has supply but no sales. Many rice shops even claim they have no goods to sell, and white rice is nowhere to be seen. The little that is available is only a small amount of indica rice. Some shops do not even have that available. It is truly a strange state of affairs.

Because according to the facts, this city is not short of rice. Not counting the public and private stockpiles, even though arrivals are said to be scarce, there is still a steady stream of 1,000 to 2,000 shi of rice arriving each day, registered in the market. It is impossible to count the rice that is not brought to market. The most reliable statistics are probably the 9,000 bags sold off by the Social Affairs Bureau every day. Among them are white rice, tribute rice, and red-tipped rice. According to population calculations, this supply of over 10,000 shi is more than enough to maintain the food supply for the people of this city. Moreover, the authorities have indicated that they can increase the supply if necessary.

Therefore, the crux of the problem clearly lies not in the supply but in hoarding and smuggling, that is, the so-called flow into the black market. There is strong evidence for this: (1) The authorities have dispatched police to strictly inspect exports and prevent reverse flows. If there were no smuggling problems, why would such strict prevention be necessary? (2) In the past two days, the police and Social Affairs Bureau have investigated and found many rice shops hoarding rice and refusing to sell. Is this not a practical example of rice merchants hoarding for profit?

Now the authorities are taking swift and decisive action, sending out teams to investigate. These hoarding and smuggling problems will undoubtedly continue to be discovered and punished according to law. But the question is whether these measures can eradicate the black market and maintain a normal food supply. In other words, will those black market merchants take this prohibition seriously and change their ways, no longer deliberately trying to outsmart the authorities? Probably no one dares to guarantee that! Now the rewards are the highest, the penalties are the most severe, and the inspections are the strictest for gold banknotes, but the gold banknote black market has never disappeared. It can be seen that relying solely on inspections and arrests to achieve the goal of stabilizing the rice market and maintaining the food supply for the people is probably still quite a distance away in reality.

Since passive measures have not fully achieved their purpose, then, when one avenue is exhausted, one must change course and take further measures. How should one begin with these further measures? We believe there are two possible paths to follow.

First, implement a purchase system to stabilize the lives of public servants and employees. The Economic Emergency Measures Plan stipulates, "Each factory, to supply workers with the necessary food, cloth, and fuel, should request the government to purchase on their behalf and should not freely purchase, which is a disguised form of hoarding." The detailed rules for implementing the measures for supplying essential daily necessities to the people have even more detailed regulations on how to supply and distribute daily necessities to public servants and employees. Article 6 states, "The government will sell goods when necessary to regulate the market." At the beginning of implementation, due to insufficient preparation, cash difference was issued for the employee portion, in order to be simple and quick. This was originally a temporary expedient. Now that rice prices are soaring and rice shops are exhibiting a phenomenon of having no goods to sell, the responsible authorities should earnestly take responsibility for purchasing on behalf and supplying in kind according to the principle of quantitative allocation, in order to stabilize the lives of general employees. Employees and public servants are only a portion of the citizens. Even if the entire food problem for the people cannot be completely solved after implementing quantitative allocation, it is better than the sold-off rice flowing into the black market, only satisfying the pockets of a few unscrupulous merchants. Moreover, with food guaranteed, workers will be more stable, and labor unrest can be expected to decrease. Therefore, in addition to the rice for public servants being handled according to the plan, it is also necessary to allocate actual goods to general employees. The government currently holds a considerable amount of rice. We believe that, in addition to these types of employees, other businesses, organizations, and private schools, all staff and employees, may as well be allowed to submit lists of names and receive a fixed allocation, in order to ensure that everyone shares the benefits equally and to stabilize the rice market.

Second, follow the example of sugar and implement rationing according to household registration. This method is the most thorough and also the most reasonable. Because if this is done, as long as the allocation is sufficient for practical use and the allocation price is not higher than the free price in neighboring areas, a black market will simply not occur. And the rice sold off by the government will naturally benefit the common people, grain by grain. It is heard that relevant parties have also proposed this. The reason for the delay in making a decision is because there are two difficulties. One is that it requires a large number of personnel and expenses to handle, and it cannot be done in the same way as the quantitative allocation of sugar and public servants and employees, which can be done by relying on others to handle it completely. The second is that the rice for allocation must have a source, which can be drawn upon continuously, and it is not convenient to be intermittent or to rely entirely on the central government. These two concerns are both facts and must be carefully considered. Originally, handling rationing is a very cumbersome and costly task. If one only relies on verbal promises and seeks to be simple and economical, then there is no way to even talk about it. Otherwise, the baojia system and household registration already have a considerable foundation, and sugar rationing is already being held continuously. One only needs to establish a responsible agency to take charge of the matter, or to expand and reorganize an existing similar allocation agency, and it seems that the first difficulty in terms of personnel can be easily resolved. As for the source of rice, it is indeed more difficult. But in addition to the Ministry of Food allocating rice, there has also been foreign rice arriving at the port recently. As long as there is a dedicated agency responsible for procuring it, it is not impossible. Because although domestic prices are high, the stock of grain has not reached the point of being completely exhausted. If the local government organizes it in terms of investment and transportation, it should be more convenient than private individuals. It is said that Jiangsu already has a ban on rice leaving the province, and the ability of rice merchants to procure and transport rice will inevitably be further weakened. In fact, it is also unavoidable for the government to take on part of the responsibility to ensure the source. Then, the only concern is that it will cost some money.

All politics inevitably cost some money. One only needs to see if the cost is worthwhile and whether it truly benefits the people. The so-called "take from the people, use for the people," is this principle not often spoken of with pleasure by financial personnel?

Therefore, the expenses for handling rice rationing are not so much a matter of whether they should be considered, but rather whether one is willing to consider them.

Since ancient times, it has been said that "the people regard food as heaven." If rice prices can be stabilized, then the hearts of the people can also be stabilized. As a result, prices, wages, livelihoods, the market, and even social stability and order can be solved in part. Since Mayor Wu took office last year, he has indeed paid great attention to food for the people and has made the greatest efforts. This can be said to be a unique insight. However, in order to eradicate the black market and ensure the supply of food for the people, the two suggestions above, although they are old sayings, seem to be worth considering. If they can be implemented, we believe that their effectiveness will not be less than simply selling off rice and passively investigating and arresting.

### White House Scheduled to Meet Tonight: Reviewing U.S. Foreign Policy; Current U.S.-Soviet Relations Highly Noteworthy; Truman Invites Congressional Leaders to Hear Marshall's Report

[Reuters Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall is scheduled to broadcast the proceedings of the Moscow Conference on Tuesday at 1:30 a.m. standard time (10:30 p.m. Shanghai time).

[Associated Press Washington, 25th] President Truman today invited leaders from both parties in Congress to meet with Secretary of State Marshall at the White House on the evening of the 27th to review the future of foreign policy. Marshall is returning from Moscow to report to the nation on the evening of the 28th about the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference and to answer new questions in Congress regarding foreign policy. According to the State Department, Marshall will broadcast to the nation for half an hour on the evening of the 28th, and will likely hold talks with members of Congress in the following days. When Marshall went to Moscow in February, it seemed that the two major issues of the Italian peace treaty and the $350 million aid plan for liberated countries had been concluded, but while Marshall was abroad, members of Congress who were good at criticizing brought up the old issues again. The senators hope that Marshall will submit a comprehensive report on the current stage of U.S.-Soviet relations based on the results of the Moscow Conference. The main issue is the $400 million aid plan for Greece and Turkey. The plan has already been approved by the Senate and will be voted on in the House of Representatives next week.

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] A responsible official told an Agence France-Presse reporter today that after Secretary of State Marshall returns to Washington, he will likely first discuss the possibility of a Pan-American Conference with President Truman and the measures to be taken to prompt Brazil to convene this conference in June or July. In fact, since the failure of the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference, American diplomats have been in agreement with the Army and Navy Departments that it is necessary for the American countries to sign an international defense pact to ensure the unity of the Western Hemisphere and thwart Soviet attempts to participate. In the current situation, President Truman and Marshall seem to advocate the immediate passage of a law allowing the United States to provide war equipment to Latin America within the scope of the American international pact, so as to standardize all countries in the Western Hemisphere. To achieve this goal, Marshall must eliminate the differences of opinion between Braden, the head of the Latin American Affairs Office of the State Department, and the Argentine government, and determine whether the Argentine government has fulfilled the obligations stipulated in the Chapultepec Pact. Braden believes that the United States must sign the American international defense pact after the Argentine government fulfills all its obligations.

### Marshall Flies from Berlin to Washington

[Associated Press Berlin, 25th] U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's plane left here at 13:26 Greenwich Mean Time (10:26 p.m. Shanghai time) today, flying to Washington. Due to bad weather, Marshall's plane changed to the northern route and is expected to arrive in Washington at 17:00 Greenwich Mean Time on the 26th (2:00 a.m. on the 27th in Shanghai time).

### U.S. State Department Decides to Establish a Policy Planning Staff: Formulating Long-Term U.S. Foreign Policy

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 25th] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson recently told the press that Secretary of State Marshall had requested the establishment of a planning staff within the State Department to be responsible for formulating the long-term foreign policy to be adopted by the United States. This planning staff has already been established and will be composed of five experts, with George Kennan, a senior official of the State Department and a Soviet affairs expert, as the chairman. However, this staff does not have executive power and can only adjust and draft plans, and it can consult with experts outside the State Department. The State Department has drafted an outline of this plan, which is still awaiting Marshall's approval.

### U.S.-Soviet Lend-Lease Accounts to Begin Liquidation

[Associated Press Washington, 25th] U.S. Acting Secretary of State Acheson recently said that the United States is about to negotiate with Soviet representatives to resolve the $11.3 billion lend-lease loan owed by the Soviet Union. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Novikov, accompanied by four economic experts, arrived in Washington on the 24th and will participate in this negotiation.

### Bevin and Clay to Meet in Berlin

[Agence France-Presse London, 25th] Informed sources here are very interested in the news that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will meet with the heads of the Allied Control Council in Berlin, and believe that General Clay, the commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, will participate in this conversation. General Clay recently said that if the Moscow Conference unfortunately fails, then after the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany, a political merger should follow. However, officials here are keeping silent on this matter.

[Agence France-Presse London, 26th] Reports that British Foreign Secretary Bevin proposed to the government the establishment of a Western Germany and the elimination of the boundaries between the British, American, and French occupation zones in Germany have been denied by the Foreign Office.

### Failure of the Moscow Conference: A Glimpse of Japanese Public Opinion

[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] The adjournment of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference without result is met with disappointment and hope in Japan. Those with hope believe that the stalemate in Europe is sufficient to accelerate the negotiation of a peace treaty with Japan, and now hope that MacArthur will make a proposal again. However, those who still painfully remember the war are deeply worried about the stalemate between the Soviet Union and the Western countries. Japanese observers say that the dark situation in Moscow has caused incredible rumors here. Some say that a U.S.-Soviet war will inevitably break out in June, and others say that the U.S. military is stepping up the training of Japanese aviators. Many people in Tokyo are almost neurotic, and some have already moved to the countryside to escape the war. The Japanese have paid close attention to the proceedings of the British Conference, and are particularly comforted by the firm opposition of the United States and Britain to the Soviet Union's immediate claim for reparations from German industrial production, believing that when the same issue is raised at a future peace conference with Japan, Britain and the United States may also advocate on their behalf.

### UN Special Session Opens Tomorrow: Discussing the Palestine Problem; Guo Taiqi Appointed Chief Representative of Our Country

[Central News Agency New York, 25th] According to an announcement today, the official list of personnel of the delegation of our country participating in the special session of the United Nations General Assembly to be convened on the 28th has been submitted to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie. The delegation includes Head Guo Taiqi, Deputy Head Xia Jinlin, Secretary-General and Advisor Zhang Zhongfu, Advisors Xu Shuxi, Zheng Zhenyu, and Wei Xueren, and technical expert Lin Xianrang.

[Central News Agency Washington, 25th, Associated Press] The State Department announced that Austin has been appointed as the chief representative of the United States to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly, and Johnson as the deputy representative.

[Agence France-Presse Lake Success, 25th] Regarding the request made by the Arab countries, advocating that Britain cease its trusteeship of Palestine and establish an independent Palestinian state. According to an official announcement, this request will not be included in the provisional agenda of the UN General Assembly.

Five Powers Discuss the Agenda

[Central News Agency New York, 25th] The representatives of the five powers, including Guo Taiqi of our country, held an informal consultation with Secretary-General Trygve Lie this afternoon on the procedural issues of the UN General Assembly on the 28th. Reporters learned from reliable sources that (1) the attitude of the Soviet Union towards the proposal of the Arab countries to immediately begin a full discussion of the independence of Palestine was not explored during the discussion; (2) the five powers informally agreed that Brazilian former Foreign Minister Aranha would be the most suitable candidate for the chairmanship of this session; (3) In addition, the five powers, in their capacity as vice-chairmen of the General Assembly, may give the remaining two vice-chairmanship positions to Colombian representative L√≥pez and representatives from India or the Philippines. It is also learned that the five powers discussed the issue of the chairmen of the six standing committees of the General Assembly, and agreed that they should be held by Canada, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, Sweden, India, and Poland or Mexico, and they will also discuss the candidates for the powerful steering committee of the General Assembly. It is reported that the five powers also agreed to formally welcome Siam to participate in the General Assembly as a new member state of the United Nations.

Arab Countries Express Their Position

[Agence France-Presse Cairo, 25th] The Arab position on the Palestine issue will be presented to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly by five of the seven countries of the Arab League. The five countries are Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Yemen and Transjordan are not members of the United Nations and therefore will not participate in the presentation. However, the five countries have not been given full authority by their superior, the Supreme Committee of Palestine, which has announced that it can deny any decision made by the five countries. The committee itself is sending two representatives to attend the UN General Assembly as observers, and they will maintain contact with the Arab representatives of the UN institutions. The position of the Arabs of Palestine is clear: they insist on two points, namely (1) establishing an independent Palestinian Arab state; (2) completely stopping Jewish immigration into Palestine. This position is somewhat similar to that stipulated in the British White Paper of 1939.

### Balkan Countries Intensify Cooperation: Organizing an Economic Alliance: To Respond to the U.S. Anti-Soviet Plan

[Reuters London, 25th] Trade negotiations between Eastern European countries have intensified in recent weeks. A trade agreement between Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria has been signed in Sofia. Observers in London believe that the intensified activities between Eastern European countries are related to President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey and the U.S. refusal to aid Yugoslavia. Some quarters even predict that the governments of the pro-Soviet countries in Southeastern Europe may organize a Balkan economic alliance to respond to the U.S. anti-Soviet economic plan. It is reported that trade negotiations between Poland and Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia, and Poland and Romania are all underway. Short-term trade agreements have already been concluded between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria at the beginning of the month.

### Soviet Union Recommends Wold as Governor of Trieste

[Associated Press Lake Success, 25th] Well-informed sources said today that the Soviet Union has appointed Norwegian Supreme Court Justice and former Minister of Justice Wold to serve as Governor of Trieste. Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States on the United Nations Security Council have notified Soviet Representative Gromyko that they are willing to consult with their respective governments on this recommendation. Wold is the second name proposed by the Soviet Union. The first name proposed was Branting of Sweden, who was reportedly rejected by the United States due to a lack of administrative experience. Wold once served as the Norwegian Foreign Minister during the war, and later became the leader of the Norwegian government-in-exile, returning to the country in November 1944. Since then, he has served as the representative of Norway to the Allied War Crimes Commission, the representative to the United Nations General Assembly in London, and the representative to the Paris Peace Conference.

### Japanese House of Representatives Re-election: Socialist Party Emerges as a Force: Likely to Organize a Coalition Cabinet

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 26th] Recent reports of the Japanese House of Representatives re-election show that the Socialist Party has won 136 seats, surpassing the ruling Liberal Party. The Democratic Party ranks third, with 113 seats. The Communist Party won only 4 seats. Although the Socialist Party has won, the conservatives (including the Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, and various small right-wing parties) still hold an absolute majority in the House of Representatives. Therefore, if the Socialist Party wants to govern, it must organize a coalition cabinet. If the victory of the Socialist Party is confirmed, then the party leader Tetsu Katayama seems likely to become Prime Minister. Katayama is a lawyer, currently 60 years old, and has authored many books on socialism.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 26th] The first general vote count results of the Japanese House of Representatives re-election are as follows: Social Democratic Party: 143 seats, an increase of 45 seats compared to before; Liberal Party: 131 seats, a decrease of 9 seats compared to before; Democratic Party: 123 seats, a decrease of 12 seats compared to before; Cooperative Party: 31 seats, a decrease of 32 seats compared to before; Communist Party: 24 seats, a decrease of 2 seats compared to before; Various small parties: 31 seats; Independents: 13 seats.

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 26th] In yesterday's re-election of the Japanese House of Representatives, Prime Minister Yoshida won the vast majority of votes in Kochi Prefecture for the first time and was elected, with nearly 24,000 votes. According to the new constitution, Yoshida still has the right to participate in the new government. Other cabinet members of the current cabinet who participated in the election, including Finance Minister Ishiguro, Interior Minister Uehara, Justice Minister Kimura, and Minister without Portfolio Saito, have also been elected. Yoshida, Ishiguro, and Uehara are all leaders of the Liberal Party, while Saito belongs to the Minseito Party. Veteran member of Congress Yukio Ozaki was elected at the age of 89.

Talking About the Palestine Issue

[Reuters, Paris, 25th] Wallace, hosting reporters here today, put forward two suggestions for resolving the Palestine issue. He believes that the natural resources of the Near East should be developed to allow Palestine to accommodate a large number of residents. At the same time, the U.S. government should remove obstacles to the relocation of European refugees to the United States within three years. Wallace believes that the Palestine issue is one that can never satisfy anyone. He sympathizes with the Jewish people's demands for nation-building and their desire to obtain a voice in the United Nations, but he condemns terrorist activities. Finally, he expressed his belief that Britain will be able to find a solution to the Palestine issue.

### The Soviet Union Continues to Oppose the International Gendarmerie Plan, No Agreement Reached

### The Social Affairs Bureau Announces a Shocking Hoarding Case; 180,000 Bags of Sugar Seized; Stored in Four Warehouses Belonging to Sixty Firms; Ordered to Sell on the Market, Prices to be Evaluated

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau announced yesterday the process of thoroughly investigating a shocking case of hoarding Peruvian sugar, amounting to as many as 187,286 bags. However, because sugar was listed as an item subject to crackdown on hoarding only after the Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice on April 25th, and the hoarding of the sugar occurred in January of this year, the Social Affairs Bureau only imposed the penalty of selling on the market, with the price to be determined at a meeting of the sugar subcommittee of the Price Evaluation Committee.

The Social Affairs Bureau received a tip at the beginning of this month, claiming that a large amount of sugar was stored in the Ewo Packing Company in Tilanqiao, the Xinyi Company warehouse at the Gonghexiang Wharf, the Shanghai Warehouse on Dongda Road, and the warehouse on Shanghai Zha Road. Director Wu then instructed Bureau officials Zhu Baohe and Zhu Baoheng on April 11th to investigate the amount of sugar stored, the names of the stored shops, and the types of sugar. It was found that there were 75,970 bags of Xinyi Company's secretarial sugar stored in warehouses 7, 9, 17, and 28 of the Gonghexiang Wharf. They were stored on January 11th of this year, originally totaling 100,000 bags, which were ordered by the Xinyi Company on behalf of Junyi and 40 other companies. When the goods arrived, all the bills of lading were distributed, and each firm could directly pick up the goods from Gonghexiang with the bill. As for the daily shipment records of Gonghexiang, only Xinyi Company was recorded, and not the name of the sugar shop. Therefore, it was very difficult to ascertain the exact number currently stored by each firm. It was also found that the Ewo Packing Company, located at 1056 Yangshupu Road, stored 80,360 bags of Melun foreign firm's Peruvian sugar, which were stored in February of this year, originally totaling 101,274 bags. This sugar was ordered by the foreign firm on behalf of Changxing and 27 other companies, and the delivery procedure was the same as that of Xinyi Company. It was also found that 29,056 bags of Changxing's Peruvian sugar were stored in the Shanghai Warehouse at 1080 Dongda Road. In addition, 1,900 bags of Changxing's Peruvian sugar were also stored in the Zha Road Warehouse. The actual number currently stored in the above four warehouses totals 187,286 bags, belonging to 60 firms. Among them, Longchang, Lianhe, Zhenhua, Yuantaiheng, Jiuhua, Shengjixin, Lida, Heyuan, Fuyuan, Hexing, Dechang, Rencheng, Yuanfengheng, Yukang, Yufengheng, Li Xingji, Dasheng, Junyi, Donghe, Dadeheng, Dahua Sugar Factory, Dayiheng, Jicheng, Huihuo, Chengda, Zhenye, Changdian, Longchang, Tongshun, Yichang, Xinhe, Gongda, Yihe, Yiyuan, Hengyu, Hengyuanren, and 36 other sugar firms have all applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for business registration. Even Watson's Soda Company has also applied for company establishment registration (but is not a sugar firm). The other 23 firms, such as Lianmei, have not yet applied for sugar merchant registration. After reviewing the situation, Director Wu and Director Gu believed that the case met the provisions of Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times. Sugar was listed as an item subject to crackdown on hoarding only after the Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice on April 25th, and the sugar was hoarded in January of this year. It was decided that regardless of whether the owners of the sugar were merchants engaged in the main business, or merchants not engaged in the main business, or people not engaged in business, all would be handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to supervise the sugar trade association to sell on the market and report to the Bureau for record.

### The Railways Bureau Convenes a Meeting to Review the Causes of Derailment; Believes It Was Caused by Overly Old Sleepers and Loose Ballast; Over One Million Sleepers Need to Be Replaced

For the sake of future driving safety and to study the causes of the two derailments, the two Railways Bureaus convened a driving safety meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by the heads, deputy heads, and technicians of the Transportation Department, Mechanical Department, and Engineering Department. Director Chen was in Beijing on official business, and the meeting was presided over by Deputy Director and Director of the Transportation Department Hou Huahua. The meeting adjourned at about 7:00 p.m. and is scheduled to continue today. According to Deputy Director Hou's statement to reporters: At the beginning of yesterday's meeting, the causes of the derailments of the Jinling train and the Sixth Express train were studied, and explanations were given for various points criticized by the outside world; (1) The width of the current railway tracks and carriages in the United States is the same as that in China, so the addition of American carriages to the Jinling train was not the main cause of the accident. (2) Each carriage of the Jinling train can hold a weight of 18 tons. If calculated with 60 passengers, adding luggage would be only about 10 tons, so it is not related to the derailment. (3) According to facts and experience, the amount of traffic has no effect on the railway tracks, so even though the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has as many as 40 passenger and freight trains per day, it will not cause derailment. In addition to the above points, the main cause of the derailment is feared to be the excessive use of sleepers and the fact that the ballast has not been replaced for a long time, resulting in danger due to looseness. The Railways Bureau has now decided to mobilize all personnel to inspect the sleepers and ballast of the entire line. However, it is quite difficult to replace the sleepers because funding and purchasing materials are not easy. Since the restoration of the Railways Bureau, investigations have shown that over one million sleepers need to be replaced on the Beijing-Shanghai line, but only over 200,000 sleepers have been replaced so far. The Railways Bureau has truthfully reported this difficult situation and the results of yesterday's meeting to the Ministry of Communications, requesting instructions on everything. The Ministry of Communications originally intended to send personnel to attend the Railways Bureau's driving safety meeting, but due to the urgency of time, they could not arrive in time.

### The Police Bureau's Traffic Control Room Will Begin Service on May 1st

### Over a Thousand Tricycles Demand Licenses Be Issued

Appeal from Northern Jiangsu Refugees

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Northern Jiangsu refugees have already manufactured tricycles for business and are requesting the authorities to issue licenses to maintain the livelihoods of over 20,000 people. Yesterday afternoon, they hosted reporters at the Central Vegetable Society. According to the representatives of the refugees: over a thousand of them, along with their families, totaling over 20,000 people, are all good people from Northern Jiangsu who came to Shanghai to escape the war. Forced by livelihood, they borrowed money with interest to purchase over a thousand tricycles. They entrusted various car shops in the city to apply for donation certificates and initially entered the market without licenses to drive, barely maintaining their family's livelihood. Unexpectedly, on July 5th of last year, the municipal government issued a notice to stop issuing tricycle licenses. The car shops took the opportunity to use the provisions of the license tax law that "vehicles that have already donated and obtained licenses in other counties or cities, and pass through or stay in this county or city for no more than two months, are exempt from license tax" to donate and obtain business tricycle licenses from counties such as Baoshan and Jiading, and sell them to them at high prices to continue driving and doing business. However, the police bureau considered this a violation of orders and detained the vehicles, confiscated the licenses, and imposed heavy fines. They then realized that they had been deceived. Although they repeatedly demanded the car shops to return the license fees, they deliberately evaded and ignored their suffering. Although the government has imposed legal sanctions on them, the losses they have suffered have not yet been ordered to be compensated. Therefore, they separately petitioned the authorities, the Municipal Council, and the Tricycle Workers' Union. They also put forward six reasons, demanding that the authorities quickly issue licenses and allow them to drive in the central district to relieve the lives of these over 20,000 refugees.

### Two Japanese War Criminals Sentenced

### The Telecommunications Bureau to Launch Mobile Telegram Service by Car in Mid-May

### The Yang Ge Arms Smuggling Case, the District Prosecutor's Office Files a Public Prosecution

[Reported by Our Newspaper] In the case of Yang Ge, a temporary pilot of the Air Transport Brigade of the Executive Yuan, smuggling arms, during the interrogation by Prosecutor Shen Zushou of the District Prosecutor's Office, the defendant confessed to the fact of smuggling arms, but claimed that the submachine gun was worth 300 US dollars given by a friend in Manila to offset his debts. The .45 caliber bullets were for the submachine gun, the .32 caliber were entrusted to him by someone, he did not know how the .30 caliber got mixed in, and the .38 caliber were for his own pistol. The prosecutor believed that regardless of whether his confession was true, he had violated Article 186, Article 38, Paragraph 1, Clause 1, and Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law by carrying arms from a foreign country to Shanghai without the permission of our country, and filed a public prosecution according to law.

### An Underground Money Exchange Cracked; Private Trading of Silver Dollars; Four Criminals Arrested for Interrogation

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau cracked down on an "underground money exchange" that privately operated in the black market for gold, foreign currency, and silver coins at 361 Fuzhou Road the day before yesterday afternoon. They seized 3,171 silver coins and 395 US dollars that were intended to be "delivered." Four people were arrested and sent for "delivery": Jin Daohong, Qu Qingzhai, Huang Yusheng, and Wang Fenghang. The name of the money exchange is Baohua, and the manager is Pan Zhongying from Zhenjiang, who has gone into hiding after the incident. The police bureau is currently investigating and arresting him. It was found that the Baohua Money Exchange and the Baokang Money Exchange at the intersection of Shandong Road and Zhongzheng Road are the same system, which started by purchasing nickel coins for the enemy during the occupation of the city. After the victory, they resumed their business as an "underground money exchange," operating not only in the buying and selling of gold and foreign currency but also in discounting. Since the government issued an emergency plan prohibiting the buying and selling of gold and US dollars, the money exchange and others still secretly engaged in black market transactions. The Economic Section of the Police Bureau received a report a few days ago and immediately sent personnel in disguise to wait and watch. It was not until 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday that they were intercepted. However, due to a lack of manpower at the time, when they went to the money exchange again with the Baojia chief to inspect the accounts and safe deposit boxes, they found nothing. As for the Baokang Money Exchange's trading in black market gold, evidence has been obtained, and Chen Zhenghong, the associate manager of the exchange, was taken to the bureau for questioning yesterday.

### The City Council Holds a Grand Tea Party to Host Party and Government Leaders and District Chiefs; Exchange Opinions and Discuss Matters of Offering Schools for Birthday Celebrations

[Reported by Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiching, and all the councilors held a tea party at the council at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to host the heads of the municipal government and various bureaus, as well as the district chiefs of various districts and the chairmen of the district people's representative conferences, to exchange opinions on municipal affairs and discuss matters of promoting the offering of schools for birthday celebrations. About one hundred people attended. First, Speaker Pan

Chairman Pan

delivered a speech, saying: The district people's representative conferences and the elected district chiefs in various districts of the city have all been respectively organized and completed, and the foundation of democracy has been established. Today, I hope that the representatives and district chiefs of various districts will express their opinions as much as possible so that they can be adopted by the council at the third meeting to be held in mid-May. And please ask the heads of various agencies to provide policy guidelines for reference. In addition, I also hope that everyone will work together to promote the plan of offering schools for birthday celebrations, which was resolved by the council last year, and complete it as soon as possible.

Mayor Wu

delivered a speech: (1) The spirit of cooperation between the City Council and the municipal government can be said to be the first in the country. The chairmen of the district people's representative conferences and the district chiefs are all elected by the people. I hope that the relationship between the two sides can be more harmonious. At the same time, I hope that the connection between the representative conference and the City Council can be strengthened. After the cooperation between public opinion institutions and government agencies, I believe that even in this most difficult period, we will be able to overcome any difficulties. (2) Regarding the matter of offering schools for birthday celebrations, although the Chairman has sent a telegram ordering us not to hold it, the safety of our country and the fate of the people of the whole country are entrusted to the Chairman. We commemorate his birthday and should do it automatically. On the one hand, it is for culture, and on the other hand, it is for our own children. This move should be supported together.

Judge Cha, the President of the Local Court

stated: Since the victory in Shanghai, the outstanding cases of various courts and temporary courts of various countries in the past are now being heard by the local court, so the affairs are extremely busy. I feel that the responsibility is great and the ability is limited, but judicial personnel must achieve (1) a calm mind, (2) an objective attitude, (3) an impartial opinion, and (4) a fearless spirit to handle cases.

Envoy Yan

expressed several thoughts, saying that the situation in Shanghai is complicated. In the past 100 years, it has been ruled by foreigners, and now the general public has forgotten the old morality and social order concepts. I hope to reorganize them. In addition, there are often unrest in the local area, which causes great pain to the citizens. We must also rely on the public to find ways to eliminate them. Standing in a supervisory position, I hope that the citizens, especially the City Council and the District People's Representative Conference, will often speak out. If there is any misconduct or corruption of the personnel of the municipal government agencies, they can report it to the Supervisory Office.

Committee Member Fang, the Chief of the Municipal Party Committee

hoped that the citizens would jointly build a Greater Shanghai and a New China after the government reorganization, and use the voice of the people to awaken all factions and parties who have not participated in the government, and stop making undemocratic performances, causing the people to suffer.

Then, Director Gu of the Education Bureau reported on promoting the matter of offering schools, hoping that the citizens would have one point of strength and do one point of strength, build schools, no matter how much or how little, just hoping to work hard for cultural work.

Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Department hoped to arouse the citizens' attention to building local autonomy, and the administrative authorities should not only adopt foreign systems for local autonomy, but should implement them according to the inherent local social and economic conditions of our country.

District Chief Wang Jian'e, on behalf of the district people, said that what they feel most painful at present is that the people do not understand local autonomy, and the government officials in charge do not pay attention to it. They hope that the City Council will supervise, guide, and value the district Baojia army. They will work hard to offer schools for birthday celebrations, but they hope that the government's policies can satisfy the people. Subsequently, several district people's representatives and Tao Yishan, the Director of the Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters, also spoke one after another. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.

### Shen Fenggang, the Director of the Pseudo-Special Service Headquarters, Tried; Recounts the Process of Sanctioning Pseudo-Officials; An Ugly Boasting Posture; Chen Gongshu Called as a Witness

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Shen Fenggang, who once served as the Director of the Third Division of the Pseudo-Special Service Headquarters and the Captain of the First Special Task Force, was tried in the High Court yesterday, and Chen Gongshu, the former Director of the Shanghai District of the Military Intelligence Bureau, who was in custody, was called to court to testify. Shen wore a blue cloth robe and smiled, confessing: I was arrested by "76" on August 7, 1939, and was ordered to join the pseudo-organization. On September 3, I was appointed as the Director of the Third Division of the Pseudo-Special Service Headquarters.

A Shot to the Bald Head

He then recounted the process of sanctioning pseudo-officials in an ugly boasting posture, claiming that there were two cases of arson that he had handled, (1) Wang Yongkui, the intelligence director of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" during the pseudo-Reformed Government, (2) Geng Jiaki. He opened a room at No. 1 Zhimeilou on Simalu. When he sent guests out at night, I fired a shot at his bald head, and he fell down in response. The bodyguard next to him was about to draw his gun, but was shot down by my subordinates. I saw that Wang's body was still wriggling, so I added another shot to his chest and then left. This case was reported to Chen Mo, the leader of the Second Action Team of the Military Intelligence Bureau's Shanghai District, and Chen then reported it to Chen Gongshu, who was the Shanghai District Director at the time.

The Surname Was Dian, The Merchant Was Jingchu

Chen Gongshu was then called to testify. Chen was short and capable, wearing a black cloth short jacket and gray cloth pants. He was originally the Director of the Shanghai District of the Military Intelligence Bureau. After being captured by "76," he defected and joined the pseudo-organization. He was initially sentenced to death by the military tribunal, but later the sentence was reduced to twelve years for meritorious service in catching traitors. He is currently imprisoned in Shanghai Prison. He seemed to be full of emotion when he appeared in court yesterday, testifying that "I did not know Shen Fenggang. I only met him once at the racecourse in 1945. Shen claimed to know me. There was a case of sanctioning Wang Yongkui. I was ordered by the Military Intelligence Bureau to carry it out. Chen Mo reported it to me afterwards, but I can't remember the name of the person who sanctioned him." At this point, the hearing was adjourned and changed to a later date for further investigation. The defendant and witness were both returned to custody.

The Shop Owner, Pu Guozhang, Was Punished

### Disputes in the Civil Shipbuilding Industry, Both Sides Almost Came to Blows During Negotiations

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The labor-capital dispute in the civil shipbuilding industry has been dragging on until now and has not been resolved. According to the labor side, the workers in the industry are divided into Ningbo and Shanghai gangs, totaling about 1,000 people. Usually, due to rain and other reasons, there are only ten or more days of work per month. The basic salary of employees was previously stipulated in the minutes signed by both parties on March 15th of last year. Now, the capital side intends to reduce wages in addition to not paying the difference due to the sluggish business. Only about 200 workers are currently working, and the rest have changed careers or returned to their hometowns, waiting for work to arrive in the summer and autumn seasons. The workers are now demanding that the capital side provide meals during the shutdown period and allow each person to advance 100,000 yuan to maintain their livelihood. In addition, they also demanded to rush to resume work. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to convene discussions on the case yesterday. The two sides disagreed and almost came to blows, and the negotiations were interrupted. It will be rescheduled for further discussion.

### Initial Trial of the Jia Zigan Homicide Case; Jiaotong University Students Crowd the Court to Observe; Accompanying Civil Suit Demands 590 Million in Compensation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The trial of the case involving the Texas Oil Company truck that struck and killed Jiaotong University student Jia Zigan commenced at the District Court yesterday morning. The defendants, driver Tan Jintang and manager Raffia, were present. Raffia himself did not appear, represented instead by a lawyer. A large number of Jiaotong University students attended the court to observe, causing considerable crowding. The family of the deceased and the student union filed an accompanying civil suit demanding compensation of 598 million yuan. The first witness to be questioned was Zhang Shili, who accompanied the victim, Jia Zigan, to Tongji University to visit friends. According to his testimony, on April 4th at 2 PM, he and Jia, along with two other individuals, traveled to Tongji University by bus. After arriving at their destination, they alighted from the bus one after another. Immediately after exiting the bus, Jia was tragically run over and killed. The Texas Oil Company truck was traveling at a high speed and did not sound its horn. The defendant, Tan Jintang, testified that he had seven months of experience driving automobiles. On the day of the incident, he was driving the company truck from north to south. The bus that Jia and the others were riding on was traveling from south to north. As he drove past the bus at a speed of seventeen yards per second, he sounded the horn as a warning. The deceased came from behind the bus, and he did not see him or know how he was struck. After the interrogation, the court ordered Tan Jintang to provide a cash bail and adjourned the trial to a later date.

### Training Talents, Building Wooden Boats: Fishery Management Office Undertakes Two Initiatives to Develop Our Fishery Industry

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Renlin, the director of the Executive Yuan's Fishery Management Office on Fuxing Island, who took office last month, has decided to prioritize the training of fishery personnel, so that they will be able to operate new-style fishing vessels and develop our nation's fishery industry on a large scale in the future.

According to Wang, in addition to Shanghai, the office will establish four other locations in Taiwan, Qingdao, Guangdong, and near the Dinghai Zhoushan Islands. The Taiwan branch has already been established, and seven fishing vessels have been dispatched there. Three fishing vessels have also been sent to Qingdao. A vessel is scheduled to be sent to Guangdong at the beginning of next month, and the location near Zhoushan can be established soon as well. This measure will prevent all fishing vessels from being concentrated in Shanghai, while also enabling local training of personnel. Fishery personnel in different regions have different languages, customs, and familiarity with the water, so it is not appropriate for them all to come to Shanghai. At the same time, the office has drafted measures for companies in various industries to send technical personnel for training, and this work will be promoted next week. Because the ownership of the office's current fishing vessels still belongs to the UNRRA, it is necessary to have personnel who can reliably operate the new-style fishing vessels, so that they can be allocated to various fishery companies. The office will provide food, lodging, and miscellaneous expenses for the trainees. The training period is nine weeks.

The second important task of the office, according to Wang, is building wooden boats. UNRRA has provided the office with a total of 35,000 tons of wood, of which two-fifths (14,000 tons) have already arrived, along with other accessories. Therefore, the office plans to build 5,000 new wooden boats and repair 3,500 old wooden boats. The new boats will be distributed according to the needs of coastal areas and the numbers before the war, and materials for repairing old wooden boats will be free of charge, with only labor costs subsidized. Measures will be established, and applications can be submitted by fishermen's cooperatives upon reporting the quantity. This work can begin in mid-May.

Existing Fleet of Over One Hundred Vessels Makes Trips of Three Weeks Round Trip

Yesterday, a reporter visited the Fishery Management Office on Fuxing Island and was given a tour of the fishing vessels. Director Wang, along with administrative advisor Naxi, the UNRRA representative, and Deputy Director Wang Yikang, hosted the reporter and reported on the recent situation of the office. Zhuang Qianding, the distribution director, accompanied the tour. It was reported that the office currently has 34 American fishing vessels, 47 Australian vessels, and over 160 other auxiliary vessels. Each British fishing vessel weighs about 140 tons and is equipped with the latest type of water depth sounder, direction indicator, and radio equipment for communication with fishing stations and other vessels. The vessels also have electric refrigerators for storing food for the crew. Artificial ice is placed in the fish storage holds to keep the fresh fish from spoiling for ten days. Each vessel carries a Chinese or foreign captain (responsible for navigation), a mechanic, a general affairs officer, and trained technical personnel, totaling about fourteen people.

The money earned from selling the fish caught by the office is used to cover some of the expenses on the vessel, and the remainder is divided among the Chinese and foreign personnel as bonuses, in addition to their salaries. The base salary for Chinese fishermen ranges from 40 to 70 yuan per month.

### China National Aviation Corporation Holds Investigation Meeting on the Shanghai-Lanzhou Plane Crash

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Shanghai-Lanzhou route flight 141 crashed on the morning of the day before yesterday, five minutes after taking off from Longhua Airport, when the left engine suddenly malfunctioned, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing, veering off the end of the runway, killing three civilians, two men and one woman. Upon hearing the news in Nanjing, the director of the Civil Aviation Administration, Dai Anguo, immediately came to Shanghai to investigate the truth. Yesterday morning, Dai, along with the director of the administration's Shanghai office, Lin Jixin, and several aviation technicians, accompanied Wang Renai and Alison from the CNAC's aircraft engineering group, as well as deputy director Chen Hongen and other relevant personnel from the company, to the site of the accident at Longhua Airport to inspect and investigate. They also presided over an aircraft accident investigation meeting convened by CNAC to study the cause of the accident and determine responsibility. The meeting ended in the evening. According to Dai, the results of the investigation need to be compiled before they can be released, and he himself will remain in Shanghai for several days.

Yesterday, Director Dai personally approved the dismantling and transportation of the engine and various parts and gasoline from the aircraft back to the airport. The fuselage will remain at the original site temporarily and will be transported back to the airport for repairs within the next few days. At its weekly meeting yesterday, CNAC discussed the issue of compensation for the villagers who were tragically killed in the crash, but no specific decision was made. The company's general affairs department will be responsible for handling the matter after instructions are received.

[Another Report] The Longhua Police Precinct reported the deaths of the three villagers who were crushed to death when CNAC flight 141 was forced to make an emergency landing on the day before yesterday to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Mayor Wu Convenes Meeting with Real Estate Developers to Discuss Extending the Lease Period for Allocated Housing

### Verdict in the Ximo Road Fire Case: Shang Zhikui and Two Others Sentenced to One and a Half Years Each; Public Endangerment and Theft Charges Not Accepted

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case involving twenty-three firefighters suspected in the Ximo Road fire, after being prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office on charges of banditry, public endangerment, and theft, has undergone several hearings at the District Court, and the verdict was announced yesterday. The main text of the judgment for the banditry charge reads: "Shang Zhikui, Dai Guangrong, and Li Chengjun are each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for theft during the fire. The remaining charges are dismissed. Cai Zhiying is found not guilty. The accused are permitted to post a written bond of 5 million yuan during the appeal period to suspend detention." Regarding the charges of public endangerment and theft, "Huang Baoqi, Li Xun, Zhu Qinglan, Zhao Rongchen, Huang Keqin, Liu Jihan, Wang Zhensan, Yang Abao, Zhou Zunwu, Wang Songqing, Tang Changsheng, Yang Qingshan, Luo Qing, Gu Fugen, Wang Zhongxiu, Wang Fengan, and Li Ashan are all found not guilty. Zhou Yuehuan and Liu Lianbi are deceased, and the prosecution is not accepted." The reasons for the judgment by Judge Merrell are as follows: The prosecutor argued that the defendants, Huang Baoqi and others, by watching the fire spread without attempting to extinguish it, were tantamount to arson and should be held responsible for public endangerment. However, at the time, the fire was extremely intense, and the glass had already melted, causing the fire to spread horizontally. Numbers 27 and 29 were also affected. According to the testimonies of witnesses and others, there were many reasons for the spread of the fire, which cannot be attributed to a small number of defendants. Regarding the theft charges, although the defendants had entered and exited the affected households at numbers 27 and 29, there was no evidence of a crime, so it would be difficult to impose criminal penalties. Many firefighters were present to observe the trial, and upon hearing the verdict, they were overjoyed. The major fire case that caused a sensation at the time has thus come to an end.

### Ministry of Education Issues Circular to Schools in Mongolia Directing Them to Pay Attention to the Task of Educational Rehabilitation; Allocates 100 Million Yuan Each in Subsidies to the Four Regions of Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Liaoning

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] In addition to establishing the Jehol-Chahar-Suiyuan-Liaoning Mongolian Education Committee for the rehabilitation of education in Mongolia, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular instructing schools in Mongolia to independently rehabilitate based on local human and financial resources, with the goal of being able to maintain themselves on a regular basis. The Ministry will only provide appropriate guidance. Regarding funding, subsidies will be awarded according to regulations based on genuine rehabilitation. Recently, it has been found that many schools and even the Committee believe that the rehabilitation effort is entirely the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, which is inconsistent with the original intention of establishing a guidance institution. Therefore, an order has been issued to reiterate the points to be noted in the relevant rehabilitation tasks: (1) The 100 million yuan in rehabilitation subsidies previously allocated to the Committee by the Ministry of Education must be spent in a verified and conscientious manner, without any extravagance or waste. At a time when the national treasury is strained and strict austerity measures are being implemented, there will be no increase beyond the original amount allocated. (2) At the beginning of school rehabilitation in Mongolia, it is necessary to first consider whether local security is guaranteed and whether financial resources and equipment can be fully self-funded. The Committee must also consider these factors when approving subsidies. (3) Education is a long-term undertaking, and short-term success should not be sought. If the conditions for rehabilitation cannot be met for the time being, recovery should be pursued gradually. Hasty action should be avoided, and actual conditions should be taken into consideration. (4) If the number of students is insufficient for a rehabilitated school that meets the conditions, the principle of merging schools or adding classes should be adopted. There is no need to greedily seek a large number of schools, which would only increase the burden of dispersing human and financial resources. The above points have been instructed to local people in Mongolia to understand the difficulties together and handle matters conscientiously.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Education is strongly promoting the rehabilitation of education in Mongolia. It has allocated 100 million yuan each in subsidy funds to the four regions of Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Liaoning, and instructed each region not to focus too much on the number of schools but to concentrate human and material resources to strengthen the faculty and equipment of existing schools.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Ministry of Education has historically provided subsidies to public and private border education institutions in various remote provinces and Mongolia. This year, due to fiscal reforms, local finances are reportedly experiencing particular difficulties, and border education undertakings will inevitably be affected. Therefore, the Ministry has allocated border education coordination funds according to the complexity and performance of border education operations in each border province and Mongolia. The amounts range from 10 million to 30 million yuan and will be distributed by the education departments, the Mongolian Education Rehabilitation Committee, or the special banner government for overall coordination.

### Anhui High School Graduation Examination to Implement Modified Measures

[Our Newspaper's Hefei Dispatch] The Anhui Education Department has been approved by the Ministry of Education to exempt junior high school graduates from provincial-level examinations in order to alleviate the economic burden on students due to recent transportation inconveniences and high travel expenses. Modified measures will also be implemented for high school graduation examinations. Examinations will be held for those who meet one of the following conditions: (1) those in the provincial capital and major ports, (2) those in the same location with more than three high schools, (3) those within 50 kilometers with convenient transportation that allows for same-day round trips. High school students in other areas with inconvenient transportation will also be exempted from examinations. Graduation certificates will be stamped with the words "Approved by the Ministry of Education for Examination Exemption" upon reporting to the Education Department. The Education Department estimates that there will be 2,718 high school graduates in Anhui Province this semester and has decided to select the seven students with the best results for recommendation to the universities of their choice, limited to three locations. A circular will be issued to all secondary schools within the next few days for compliance.

### Shanxi Awaits Rescue from Book Famine

Special Plane Flies to Beiping to Transport Books

[Taiyuan Dispatch] Shanxi has long felt the pinch of a book famine. This spring, Commander-in-Chief Yan specially consulted with the Zhengzhong Book Company to establish a branch in Taiyuan. Due to difficult transportation between Beiping and Jin, making book transport impossible, three special planes were dispatched to Beiping to transport textbooks printed in Beiping by the Seventh Associated Publishing House to Shanxi. Fortunately, the book famine problem has been resolved. Recently, the Ministry of Education adopted an open policy regarding the copyright of national standard editions, ordering the Shanxi Provincial Government to find its own way to print and supply them. The Shanxi authorities believe that this piecemeal supply method will inevitably lead to an even more severe book famine. Therefore, they have again consulted with Zhengzhong, Commercial Press, and Zhonghua Book Companies, requesting them to continue to be responsible for the supply. It is reported that each branch has requested instructions from the Shanghai headquarters.

Each school should submit a special report on the training of normal school students to the responsible education department within one month after the end of each academic year. Each department should, within two months after the end of each academic year, report to the Ministry for review a list of the training situation of normal school students reported by each school, with reference to the reports of the inspectors.

### Hong Kong's Xingdao and Seoul Fight to a Draw in Shanghai - Fans are Crazy - Crowd Surges and Yiyuan is Trampled - Many of the 50,000 Spectators are Injured

After the Hong Kong Xingdao Football Team arrived in Shanghai the night before last, it faced off against the Seoul Football Team at Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. Fans were awed by the reputation of both teams, and the number of spectators was estimated at over 50,000. The large stands around the stadium, the flat roof, and the roofs of the houses at the south end were all occupied by fans, an unprecedented record since the start of ball games. Long-distance fans had been standing in front of the gate of the City Sports Center as early as 1 p.m., waiting to buy tickets. The gate of Yiyuan was rushed and broken by the crowd at around 2:30 p.m. More than 20 people were injured in the surge. Two of them were discovered and sent to Guangci Hospital. One was Wang Wei, 23 years old, with serious chest and head injuries. The other had minor injuries. His name was Shen Huixiang, 17 years old, and he was discharged from the hospital for recuperation after treatment. In addition, there were many cases of clothing being torn or shoes and socks being trampled off. The reporter witnessed a Western child wearing a gabardine suit. When he was squeezed out of the crowd, his trousers had turned into shorts, as the two trouser legs had long been trampled to shreds by others.

The game was originally scheduled to start at 4 p.m., but the bamboo fences around the stadium collapsed, and the audience poured into the inner circle of the stadium, causing chaos. With the efforts of armed police, voluntary police from the Chujiawan Police Station, and military police, the game was barely started at 4:35 p.m. However, it was disrupted by some fans again in less than two minutes. Finally, the red police car of the security police brigade arrived at the scene to suppress the disturbance. The police jeep drove into the stadium, and the armed personnel cooperated closely. The crowd gradually dispersed, and the game was restarted at 5:20 p.m. However, the original referees Chen Jixiang, He Chunhui, and Huang Renyi were not present, and Shen Huichun was temporarily appointed as the referee, with Yu Hengzhi and Li Ning as linesmen. Because it was already late, the upper and lower halves of the game were played for 30 minutes each. The result was a 0-0 tie.

After the kickoff, Seoul launched the first attack, with Lim Chang-sik and Jeong Nam-sik working together. "Left-foot King" stood alone, dealing with the situation calmly. Zhang Jinhai dribbled the ball quickly, passing it to the left corner. Cao Qiuting countered with a lob shot, which was saved by Che Chunjong for a corner kick. Qiuting took the corner kick, and the landing point was excellent. Park Gyu-jeong headed to clear the danger, and the ball fell to the center. Li Zhaorong was waiting and swept it with his foot, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Che Chunjong was covered in cold sweat. Before long, Seoul launched a full-scale attack. Xu Jingcheng retreated to defend the third team guard, and Hou Rongsheng was resourceful, heading and kicking, busy in defense. Seoul's attack failed, giving Xingdao a chance to counterattack. Fortunately, the defense was tight, and there were no mistakes. The first half ended soon after. The score was 0-0, with no clear winner.

Switching sides, both teams kept their original lineups. Xingdao launched a general attack. Led by Zhang Jinhai, the five forwards advanced together, with Cao Qiuting and He Yingfen flying on both wings. Li Zhaorong secretly launched cold arrows, and Kim Gyu-hwan headed the ball to defuse the danger. Seoul took the opportunity to attack, with Kim Yong-sik, Jeong Nam-sik, and Lim Chang-sik using triangular passes to launch a large-scale attack. Woo Jeong-hwan broke through an opening and hooked the ball from the baseline, but Yu Yaode jumped up and caught it, escaping the danger. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time, and the time was up, with no goals scored, resulting in a tie.

### Stadium to Be Repaired - No Games Today

### Mayor's Cup Basketball Finals - Columbus Defeats Hualian - A Goal in the Last 20 Seconds Decides the Victory

[Our Dispatch] In the Mayor's Cup basketball final last night, Columbus scored a goal by Bluechi in the last 20 seconds to win the Mayor's Cup with a score of 60-58. In the first half, Hualian was ahead by two points with a score of 31-29.

Due to the disturbance in the Yiyuan football game, the organizers originally planned to postpone the game, but after notifying the teams, it was difficult to change, so it was held as scheduled, with no fewer than 4,000 spectators.

Columbus's Xu Jineng was able to attack and defend and scored 26 points alone, which can be called one of the best performances by Chinese and Western players last night. Bluechi's quick movements were unbelievable, and Lin Hua and Da John were also highly meritorious.

Hualian was supported by five tigers from beginning to end, fighting hard to the end. In contrast, the opponent used an eight-man rotation, waiting for work. A difference of one goal is not a crime of war.

The game started at 7:25 p.m. Columbus's Bluechi and Xu successively scored two goals, Hualian was surprised and called a timeout, and Da John followed with a goal, making it six points. Hualian relied on Chen Xuesong to score in the basket, and Chen, Wu, Bao, and Kong became excited and scored frequently. However, the momentum of both sides was strong, and soon they were ahead by 10-9. Cheng Zhang made one free throw and one shot, tying the score at 12 points. Xuesong scored two goals, surpassing by two points with 16-14. Columbus replaced Beina and Tuo with Lin Hua, and also asked to rest temporarily to discuss tactics again. Both sides were too nervous, and Kong and Li missed two free throws, but Bluechi scored two goals in an instant, and Hualian fell behind by two points. Then they got a good pass, and Xuesong tied the score at 18. The two sides fought fiercely, and the difference was always within one point. Finally, Hualian led by two points with 31-29 in the first half.

In the second half, Wu Chengzhang took the lead, shooting from far away again, and Xu equalized with one goal, 35-31. Da and Xiao John each scored one goal, tying the score at 35. Kong Bao increased the score to 38, and Columbus once again surpassed by one point (40-41). Soon Hualian had an advantage of 44-43 and 51-46. Tuo Lin Hua transferred Xiao John, and after Tuo came on the scene, his sharpness was greatly revealed, changing the situation to a 54-54 tie. Bluechi scored one goal, and Columbus was two points ahead. With great difficulty, Zhenzhong tied the score, and Tuo Lin Hua, Chengzhang, and Bluechi successively scored, and Columbus decided the game with 60-58 in the last 20 seconds.

Columbus Throws Fines Fouls Score
Bluechi 7 2 3 16
Bailao Fu 0 0 1 0
Xiao John 1 0 1 2
Xu 11 4 4 26
Aobolin 0 1 2 1
Beina 0 0 2 0
Tuo Lin Hua 3 0 0 6

### Scraps from the Basketball Sidelines

The Mayor's Cup basketball tournament for men's teams has come to a successful conclusion: Hualian and Columbus fought the final battle last night, and Hualian unfortunately lost the championship in the final moments by a difference of one goal.

Hualian's use of Kong Guangyi and abandonment of Ren Xiangcheng was a miscalculation. Kong is good at long-range shooting, but his speed and movement are not as good as Xiangcheng's. The game in the first half was a competition of strength and speed. Lao Kong's movements were obviously slow compared to the other nine people. When the ball was in his hands, there was almost no way to pass it out, and there was no chance to aim for a long-range shot.

In the first half, both teams focused on offense. All five players of Columbus had formidable stamina and speed. Hualian was obviously using the wrong strategy at this time, competing with the opponent for strength, speed, and shooting. After the strength was exhausted, although they switched to slow attacks and short passes in the second half, they had already suffered a great loss. If they had always used the strategy of the second half, it would have been a different situation.

I believe that the above two points are the main reasons for Hualian's failure last night. In addition, Columbus's shooting skills are improving day by day; they are also gradually familiar with the strategy against the Chinese team, which is also a necessary condition for victory.

Da Li's body after illness was unable to subdue Xu's activity. Da Li temporarily changed his tactics from defense to offense, and scored five goals - breaking Da Li's own record in recent years. Xuesong was steady, and A-di was too greedy for credit, and there were several times when he should not have shot but did. Lao Bao has done his best.

When fighting a team of similar strength, Hualian still inevitably falls into a state of psychological panic, especially Lao Bao and A-di. (Changnian)

### National Federation of Industries Petitions the Import Management Committee Yesterday - The Results of the Negotiations Were Very Satisfactory

President Zhang Largely Agreed with All Points

[Our Dispatch] Industrial representatives Qian Xiangbiao, Hong Nianzu, Tian Heqing, Dong Hefu, Xi Zhengxiu, Yang Liren, and six others, accompanied by Wu Yun Chu, chairman of the National Federation of Industries, went to the Central Bank around 11 a.m. yesterday to petition the Import Management Committee. President Zhang personally received them and answered the representatives' requests as follows: (1) Regarding the allocation of import quotas, the relevant trade associations should first consult on the principles and values, and then the Department of Industry and Commerce Guidance and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should organize review opportunities and jointly agree on a point. Zhang expressed his agreement. (2) Regarding the request to import necessary raw materials, accessories, and production equipment, Zhang asked the representatives: If you get low-priced official foreign exchange, will the finished products be sold at a lower price in the future? Representative Tian Heqing replied: Manufacturers only seek legitimate profits and will never seek exorbitant profits from cheap raw materials. As for the determination of the selling price of finished products, we are willing to adopt a negotiated pricing system. Wu Yun Chu also stated on the spot that since the implementation of the quota system, the price of raw materials has increased tenfold, while the price of finished products has only doubled. Therefore, manufacturers are in great pain, so they hope that raw materials can directly enter the hands of producers in the future. After listening, Zhang expressed great sympathy and hoped that the Federation of Industry and Commerce could do more investigation and statistics on this. (3) Regarding the request to prohibit unnecessary finished products, he expressed sympathy and asked the Federation of Industry and Commerce to provide a detailed list so that it could be forwarded to the Import Management Committee for handling. (4) Regarding the request to increase quotas, Zhang said that he was willing to accept the opinions of the industrial community, but because the government's foreign exchange holdings are limited, it may be difficult to satisfy everyone. (5) Regarding the handling of overseas orders before February 17, Zhang said that each factory should solve it individually. The representative also proposed that each factory export its finished products abroad to earn foreign exchange and add production machinery to the factory. Zhang expressed his strong support.

Regarding the industrial loan portion, the delegation did not propose specific figures for increasing industrial loans; Zhang accepted the request to increase industrial loans and for each association to conduct a preliminary review of the loans; Regarding the request to increase the number of review committee members, Zhang agreed to increase the number by four or five and asked the Federation of Industry and Commerce to work with the associations to nominate them. Also, the Federation of Industry and Commerce has scheduled to convene a general meeting of members on Tuesday of last week to report on the petition process.

### Mayor Calls Rice Merchants for Talks - New Price Limit Set for White Rice - Retail Price of 168,000 Yuan

[Our Dispatch] Mayor Wu convened rice industry representatives again yesterday morning to discuss and set a new price limit. It is stipulated that starting today, the retail price of white rice shall not exceed 168,000 yuan, and the market transaction price shall not exceed 160,000 yuan. Violators will be severely punished. It is reported that the government has ordered a total of about 170,000 tons of Saigon rice, a portion of which, about 20,000 tons, will arrive in Shanghai within days. The China Trust Bureau will allocate the rice to the municipal government for the exclusive purpose of regulating the food supply for Shanghai residents. The authorities have full confidence in suppressing rice prices in this city.

The arrival of goods in both the northern and southern markets yesterday was almost nonexistent, with only 295 stones in total. The Social Affairs Bureau still released 9,000 bags of rice. After the simplified procedures for withdrawing rice from the allocation system, the daily delivery of rice from the warehouses has reached 12,000 bags in the past two days.

The flour market is scarce and sells briskly, rising by more than a thousand yuan. Trade in iron filings is very active, stepping up by two or three thousand yuan. Soybean cake continues to add more than a thousand yuan. Soybeans are in strong demand and supply, with 10,000 bags already arriving from the Northeast, and prices are expected to rise. Broad beans are being vigorously absorbed from Southeast Asia, and high-quality goods continue to rise by two or three thousand yuan, while medium-quality goods are fair. Horse beans are a rare commodity and can be hoarded, soaring by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Red beans are being purchased from South China, and prices are rising steadily, adding another six or seven thousand yuan. The supply and demand of red sorghum are scarce, without any ups and downs. Foreign companies are still keenly purchasing sesame seeds and kernels, making steady progress and continuing to rise by three to five thousand yuan.

### Edible Oil Soars

[Our Dispatch] Edible oil prices continued to soar yesterday, with soybean oil hitting a new high of 510,000 yuan, barrel peanut oil at 488,000 yuan, and Jeep barrel peanut oil at 535,000 yuan. Regarding oil pressing raw materials, market prices remained firm. Soybeans were priced at 159,000 yuan per dan, Hankou and Zhazha beans at 140,000 yuan, and Guide peanuts at 269,000 yuan per Lao Zu.

Industry insiders analyzed the reasons for the continuous rise in oil prices in recent days: (1) In the past, our country signed agreements for the export of edible oil and raw materials, and the amounts were quite large. Recently, they have been shipped out one after another. (2) Recently, the black market foreign exchange has soared, and the trend of smuggling raw materials for oil extraction has also become rampant. (3) The production of oil by each factory is restricted by negotiated prices, and the price of raw materials is rising daily, so the production volume is shrinking daily. (4) It is rumored that the Logistics Department has recently purchased soybeans in Bengbu, Hankou, Xuzhou, and other places, which has a significant impact on the supply of raw materials.

### Man-made Silk Prices Rise Again

The price of rayon rose again in the city yesterday. After the opening price of No. 120 Takayama Yuki was called 1.9 million yuan, people were extremely excited, and the price rose slowly but surely. The closing price at noon was 2.3 million yuan. It was re-priced in the afternoon, with a call price of 3 million yuan for weekly bills. As a result, it rose by another million yuan compared to the previous day. The call price of No. 75 Golden Rooster Semi-gloss also rose by one million yuan, but there were no transactions. Transactions by factories were very rare. Yesterday, the call prices were uniformly increased, with each grade rising by six or seven million yuan. Yesterday, only five dan of D-grade Takayama Yuki were sold in spot transactions, with a price of 15 million yuan. There were no other transactions. Because the price of raw materials has risen, the call prices for silk fabrics have all increased by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, but there were no transactions. Dachun checkered crepe opened at 26,200 yuan and transactions were made immediately, and then it rose to 400 yuan. Although there were no shortages of selling at high prices, call prices continued to rise, and the closing price was 6,700 yuan. Weekly bills opened at 7,000 yuan, and the spot price rose by about 1,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Stable Cotton Cloth Market Conditions

Yesterday, the Spinning and Weaving Company sold various cloths as usual. The price limit policy has been changed to a flexible management approach, which has revitalized the market transactions. Two types of grey cloth were offered. Blue Crane fine cloth was limited to the dyeing and weaving industry, priced at 218,000 yuan. Another 20-count extra fine cloth was listed at 159,000 yuan, distributed to dealers by number. Within the market, Dragon Head fine cloth was priced at 255,000 yuan, Five Blessings at 245,000 yuan, 20-count extra fine cloth at 200,000 yuan, and Basket Chicken at 240,000 yuan. Other colored cloths and shirting remained largely unchanged. Four Gentlemen drill cloth initially opened at 224,000 yuan, and retail buyers, seeing the low price, replenished their stocks, pushing the price up to 228,000 yuan.

### Buying Side Holds the Advantage, Chinese Stocks Rise Again

Chinese stocks advanced again yesterday, but the rise was mainly driven by miscellaneous and new stocks, so the increase was relatively moderate. Funds from the yarn and cloth sector continued to seep in, forcing Jiemian financiers to replenish their positions near the close. New buying from northern financiers joined in, but the limited supply from money exchange financiers and young financiers was still insufficient to reverse the oversupply. The market opened high in the morning. Jinglun continued to hit the limit up due to opening too low. After the opening, Di Yong Yarn No. 1, 2, 65, 224, 117, 154, 83, and 217 were bought up, and Innerwear No. 97, Matches No. 224, etc., were the first to hit the limit up, rising to 4840 yuan.

No. 76 and 56 continued to support, and retail investors rushed to replenish their positions, raising Di Yong Yarn to 4920 yuan at the close. The market was flat after the close.

Among the cold stocks, Sino-French, Commerce, China Textile, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Matches, Jinglun, Wuhe, Jiufu, Xinya, and Innerwear all hit the limit up. National Goods and Datong Cement each rose by about 10%, and China Silk only rose slightly. The rise in off-market stocks was even stronger.

### Few Transactions in Unified Bonds

Public bonds were stable yesterday. Rooms 512 and 360 had deliveries, while Room 556 sold. Unified Bond C opened at 14,200 yuan in the morning, with a high of 14,600 yuan, a low of 13,600 yuan, and finally struggled outside of 14,000 yuan. The final result was a drop of 200 yuan from the previous close for all prices, with a turnover of only two to three million yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Initially Flat, Then Strong

Foreign stocks were initially flat but then strong yesterday. Funds from the yarn and cloth sector were active. New buying was seen from northern financiers, Guang financier also joined, and retail investors mostly liquidated, mainly because the Hong Kong exchange rate was very stable.

Smaller stocks were more active. Compared to the previous close, Yeguang, Paper, and Yi Beer each rose by about 15%, and the remaining stocks rose by 5% to a weak 10%.

### First Preparatory Meeting of the National Federation of Money Trade Associations

It is reported that the interest rate has been approved by the Banking Association.

### Flour Mill Representatives List Difficulties, Mayor Wu Promises to Find Solutions

Next Month's Flour Allocation to Remain at 300,000 Bags, Pricing Issues to be Discussed at Meeting Next Week

Five major flour mills in the city, including Fuxin, Chefeng, Huazhong, Yutong, and Xin, jointly submitted a document to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating that it would be difficult to continue supplying flour for civilian use at the current price limit for next month. They listed the following points: (1) The quantity of old wheat in producing areas is extremely limited, and new wheat has not yet entered the market. The city needs about 80,000 dan of wheat per month for the allocation of flour, and the possible purchase volume at present may be less than one-third, which is far from the required amount. (2) There are many transportation obstacles. Wheat that has been purchased in some areas, such as northern Jiangsu and Hankou, cannot be shipped to Shanghai due to unstable local conditions, lack of transportation facilities, or local bans on exports. (3) Compared to the purchase price and the cost of grinding flour, the difference per bag is as high as 40,000 yuan. Even if the China Trust Bureau distributes profit-sharing flour to subsidize losses, it will not be enough. After the representatives of the factories presented the above three points to Mayor Wu, Mayor Wu promised to find solutions within the month. For the allocation issue next month, the China Trust Bureau will increase the allocation to supplement the flour needed. The profit and loss between the cost and the allocation price will be discussed by relevant parties next week to seek a reasonable solution. The allocation quota for next month will remain at 300,000 bags, without reduction.

### Sales Results of US Dollar Bonds

[Our Report] The New Bond Sales Committee revealed the sales results yesterday. The total amount was USD 168,900 for short-term treasury bills and USD 61,100 for US dollar public bonds, which were sold by Zhejiang Industrial, China Industrial, Xinyong, Qichang, and other firms.

### Few Transactions in Chinese Medicine

The Chinese medicine market is experiencing rising prices in the western drug sector, causing public anxiety and making it difficult to purchase. Aucklandia costus is priced at 40,000 yuan in cash, and Bai Chuan is priced at 16,000 yuan. Although there are transactions, they are small in number. Crude fennel is priced at 1,600 yuan, and Northern Apricot is priced high at 6,000 yuan, with few transactions. Out-of-town customers are quite wary, and local additions are taking a wait-and-see approach.

### Brisk Foreign Tea Transactions

Wenzhou's new Fine Tea was still being purchased by Yudaobang brokers yesterday, boosting market sentiment and pushing prices higher. Other varieties were sold sporadically, with little change in the process. As for the foreign tea market, Wang Yutai is focused on the purchase of last year's third lot of Keemun tea. Transactions remain strong, but the market trend is still very weak. It is understood that Wuchang Tea Company is very interested in absorbing the large batch of Pingshui tea from the 35th year, and Chenchouzhen and Jardine Matheson also have good demand. They are currently negotiating with the owners. If it can be resolved smoothly, the dying foreign tea market will receive a stimulant, and will be able to gradually recover.

### Credit Letter Extension Applications Should Be Submitted to the Import Control Committee for Review

[Our Report] The Business Bureau of the Central Bank issued Circular No. 96 to all designated banks yesterday, stating that the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee has decided that from now on, all credit letter extension applications should be submitted by the designated banks to the relevant departments of the Import Control Committee for review based on the type of imported goods. For applications submitted before November 17, 1946, the extension matters should be handled by the Non-Quota Import Review Office. All procedures for extension applications can still be handled in accordance with the previous circulars issued by the Bank regarding extensions.

### China Silk Corporation Holds Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors, Last Year's Surplus Exceeds 1.3 Billion Yuan

[Our Report] The fifth joint meeting of directors and supervisors of China Silk Corporation was held yesterday at 10:00 AM at the Jinmen Hotel. Directors Zhou Yichun, Pan Xulun, Ouyang Lun, Leng Jun, Chu Fucheng, Zheng Bijiang, Shao Shenpei, Tan Xihong, Ge Jingzhong, Tang Xizu, and others attended. Zhou Yichun chaired the meeting. There were four important reports: (1) Report on the company's business, (2) Report on the final accounts for the 35th year, (3) Report on the participation in the silk weaving joint venture company and the cooperative silk factory, (4) Report on the distribution of the company's surplus.

There were two important resolutions: (1) Review the final accounts for the 35th year. Resolution: Approved, and submitted to the Standing Committee of Supervisors for review. (2) The Ministry of Economic Affairs issued an order promulgating measures for the sale of state-owned enterprises to private enterprises, stipulating that the company should first issue 50% of its shares for public sale. However, how to increase the total assets of the company and how to issue shares is submitted for discussion and resolution. Resolution: An valuation committee will be formed first to discuss the issue of share issuance and valuation. The proposed members include two representatives from the company, private silk factories, and the Central Trust Bureau, and one representative from the Audit Department. In addition, the company's total surplus for last year was 1.38 billion yuan in national currency. 70% of this amount must be turned over to the national treasury, amounting to approximately 1 billion yuan. After deducting the direct business taxes, which total approximately 80 million yuan, the remaining amount is small. However, rumors that the company is a loss-making enterprise have been proven to be inaccurate.

### Sluggish Sales of Hardware

The hardware market has risen by about 20% this week compared to last week. Today's market price is slightly calmer, but the selling price of Kunming Brand green silk cloth is still alarming. However, the actual sales of various goods are sluggish, and the price of sheep liver lacquer has also increased.

### Buyers Absorb at Lower Prices, Yarn Prices Trend Higher Again

Yesterday, the yarn market saw the authorities order each yarn number to sell existing yarn, price limits were lifted, and free trade was permitted. The market resumed trading, with 130 packages traded. The market had fallen too much the previous day, and dyeing and weaving factories absorbed at lower prices. Actual sales on the street were active, and market sentiment was firm. 42-count Blue Phoenix was quoted as high as 12.3 million, and 20-count Double Horse 6 million, a recovery of 200,000 to 800,000 compared to the previous day.

### China Mercantile Bank Celebrates 50th Anniversary

Lumber is Lively

Fir has risen sharply, and foreign pine is also following suit. Yesterday, the lumber market was very prosperous.

### Transportation Issues Resolved, Sichuan and Hubei Tung Oil Can Arrive

Tung oil prices are weak in the foreign market, which has made it difficult for exporters, because the weakness of foreign market prices is still due to our high costs, and the key to high costs is that the transportation problem has not been resolved reasonably. The Export Association is actively trying to help. It is reported that recently, during the flood season, the association specially negotiated with the Chongqing Shipping Allocation Committee, requesting more tonnage allocation, and it is reported that agreement has been reached. It is estimated that within three months, 30,000 tons of dong oil from Sichuan and Hubei can be transported to Shanghai. The transportation problem has been resolved, and the cost of tung oil is expected to be reduced. Compared with foreign market prices, tung oil can be exported continuously in the future.

### Peruvian Sugar Arrives in Shanghai

[Our Report] The former China Toaster arrived in Shanghai, carrying 40,000 bags of sugar from Peru, berthed at China Merchants Bureau Zhongzhan for unloading, and was transferred to buoys 22 and 23 yesterday.

Also, the Haikang wheel arrived in Shanghai from Qinhuangdao yesterday, carrying 1,910 tons of soybeans and 482 pieces of firebricks, and is currently berthed at the Jinliyuan Wharf for unloading.

### Wheat Supply Problems

The most difficult problem currently faced by flour mills is the supply of wheat. In terms of price, Yangzhou wheat costs 105,000 yuan per dan to Shanghai. Wuxi wheat costs 115,000 yuan per dan to Shanghai. Assuming that wheat costs 110,000 yuan per dan, the cost of producing each bag of flour is 76,000 yuan. In terms of wheat quality, due to the rising prices of everything, the trend of adulteration is becoming more and more intense. Often, each dan contains 8 to 20 catties of impurities, which invisibly increases production costs.

According to an estimate by a flour industry magnate, the provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui can roughly harvest 6 million dan of wheat this year. At the same time, it is hoped that 4 million dan of foreign wheat will be shipped in, for a total of 10 million dan of wheat, so the flour production in Shanghai this year can reach 17 million bags. This number is barely enough to supply the consumption of flour in East China and North China. However, this number is incomparable to the pre-war period. In the pre-war period, the wheat production in northern Jiangsu alone reached more than 40 million dan per year. The flour production in Shanghai alone reached more than 30 million bags per year.

### Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury Revise Exchange Rates in Various Regions

[Our Report] The exchange rates of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury for remittances to various regions will be slightly revised starting from the 28th. Quanzhou is 45 yuan per 1,000 yuan (originally 30 yuan), Fuzhou is 40 yuan (originally 35 yuan), other regions in Fujian are 45 yuan (originally 35 yuan). Xuzhou is 8 yuan (originally 5 yuan). Nantong is 8 yuan (originally 6 yuan). Bengbu is 10 yuan (originally 8 yuan). Other regions in Anhui, except Wuhu, Bengbu, Tunxi, and Shexian, are 15 yuan (originally 12 yuan). Ganzhou is 10 yuan (originally 5 yuan), Jiujiang is 10 yuan (originally 8 yuan). Other regions in Zhejiang, except Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Huzhou, Haimen, and Linhai, are 20 yuan (originally 15 yuan). Xufu is 10 yuan (originally 15 yuan), other regions in Sichuan, except Chongqing, Chengdu, Xufu, and Fangxian, are 10 yuan (originally 5 yuan). Yunnan is 5 yuan (originally 2 yuan).

The exchange rates for other important locations will remain unchanged. Guangzhou is 75 yuan, Shantou is 80 yuan, Changsha and Hengyang are both 55 yuan, Hankou and Wuchang are both 50 yuan, Shashi and Yichang are both 55 yuan, and Tianjin, Beijing, Hangzhou, and Chongqing are all 2 yuan, and Chengdu is 5 yuan.

In terms of commercial firms, the exchange rate in Guangzhou is 120 yuan to 170 yuan, Shantou is 150 yuan, Hankou is 70 to 80 yuan, and Changsha is 60 to 80 yuan. The exchange rates are still expensive.

People from national banks said that the national banks have always maintained unchanged exchange rates for Guangdong, Shantou, Hankou, Changsha, and other places in the past two weeks, so they hope to stabilize the exchange rates of commercial firms. If commercial firms do need to remit funds for the purchase of raw materials by manufacturers, and can provide sufficient reasons and documentation, the national banks will be happy to facilitate the transfer of the large amount of funds. Moreover, the national banks also offer commercial firms a discount of 70% to 90% on the stipulated exchange rate for remittances. Commercial firms already have legitimate profits, so they hope not to raise exchange rates further to stabilize the foreign exchange market. At the same time, it is heard that the head of the domestic remittance department of the national bank is currently negotiating with the bank's issuing bureau on a proper solution to suppress the high exchange rates.

The Vietnam Issue Triggers a Great Disturbance - The Tides of the French Cabinet, From Turmoil to Calm

The Vietnam incident began with the Haiphong kerosene case on November 19th last year. The war spread to Hanoi, and then both North and South Vietnam became battlefields. However, neither side declared war, similar to the situation after the Lugou Bridge Incident in our country. France allowed the local garrison to act freely and the local official news agency reported exclusively to France. The news it conveyed did not seem to reflect the facts. It claimed that the Haiphong issue arose because the French inspected small Chinese boats smuggling goods, and the Vietnamese shelled them without investigation. The war in Hanoi was a planned arrangement by the Vietnamese. After receiving the Vietnamese reply agreeing to negotiations at 6 PM on December 18th, the entire city was plunged into darkness and gunfire erupted at 8 PM the next night. The news lightly omitted the first two days (December 17th) when French troops attacked the Vietnamese government and the presidential residence, occupied them after fierce street fighting, Ho Chi Minh escaped alone, and Hoang Minh Giam was seriously injured. This situation is still being concealed in Paris. As for the piles of Chinese corpses, not a word was mentioned. It was only said that the Chinese were deeply protected by the French, their property was intact, and the Chinese government repeatedly asked the French to take care of them, to prove the greatness of French power. Only the Chinese in Vietnam know the suffering.

(I)

The war has passed confusedly for four months. The French Parliament has repeatedly delayed discussions. It is clear that the planned military expenditure will be exhausted by the end of March, and future military expenditure must be approved by the Parliament. Therefore, discussions had to begin on the 11th of this month to determine France's policy towards Vietnam. Who would have thought that this discussion would shift from the Vietnam issue to party issues, to personnel issues, to issues of resisting Germany and collaborating with Germany, to Russia, to government organization, to the powers of the Ministry of Defense, causing the Speaker and the Prime Minister to lose face. A female member of parliament who had been sentenced to death by the Germans slapped a male member of parliament who had curried favor with the enemy and acquired property on both sides of his face. The leader of the Popular Republican Movement, Schumann, and a member of the Radical Socialist Party also got into a brawl in the meeting place because of a mocking laugh, grabbing each other's ties and refusing to let go. As for the numerous adjournments and walkouts during the discussions, that goes without saying. This is a rarely seen state of disorder in the history of the French Parliament. Even the Speaker himself said: "Sometimes reason cannot suppress emotions." Fortunately, the Speaker was an experienced Mr. Herriot, who was able to control the whole scene. From the 11th, there were six sessions of discussions over ten days. Fortunately, meetings could still be held. If it had been someone else, who knows how much worse it would have been. The detailed account of the general assembly is as follows:

The general assembly opened at 3 PM on the 11th. Members of parliament gathered, and the visitor and press seats were packed. The atmosphere was very tense, and everyone held their breath in silence. Herriot sat high on the Speaker's platform, and Overseas Minister Moutet led his colleagues, Sainteny and four others, sitting quietly in the front row below the platform. The first to take the stage to speak was Ramarony, a member of the far-right Republican Liberty Party. He said, "We French have built 32,000 kilometers of roads and more than 3,000 kilometers of railways in Annam for eighty years, and cultivated more than 2 million hectares of land, which shows that Vietnam needs our experience, science, and creative talent. This country is in a state of internal and external troubles. Who else will they turn to for protection in the future if not France? Only France can guide the Vietnamese people towards freedom and morality... Who knew that a few minority elements, taking a risk, would forcibly resort to arms. Therefore, we should adopt strong measures to deal with those rebels who intentionally expel French expatriates, and use gentle policies to treat the people, and maintain France's substantial interests in the Far East. All compromises and hesitant attitudes should no longer exist." After speaking, he quietly walked off the stage. Then, another member of the Republican Liberty Party, Debrun, took the stage. He hoped that the Colonial Minister's promise not to abandon Vietnam "can be realized," because only France can maintain freedom and culture in Vietnam. He clearly stated that Vietnam is not Vietnam. After speaking, his fellow party member, Andre, took the stage and continued to expound the views of the right wing. However, he deviated from the Vietnam issue and first asked a question, "Why is the Ministry of Defense headed by a communist? On the surface, it seems like a nominal cabinet seat, just filling a quota, only dealing with military needs, health, and accommodation in defense planning; in reality, all military orders must be countersigned by him before they take effect. Now it's the Vietnam incident that has expanded, causing obstacles everywhere; furthermore, the communists have always opposed military preparations. Before Hitler came to power, Thorez went to Berlin and gave a speech to German workers on January 15, 1933, opposing the occupation of the Ruhr, Saar, opposing demanding reparations from Germany, opposing the Treaty of Versailles, advocating complete independence for all oppressed colonies, and opposing all military budget estimates. Two years later (1935), Laval signed an agreement with Stalin in Moscow, and the communists changed their tune: they accepted the military budget estimates related to national defense and became the most vehement opponents of Hitler's Germany; at every meeting, before singing the Internationale, they would first sing the Marseillaise. When the Second World War was about to break out, Germany and Russia concluded the Non-Aggression Pact of August 23, 1939, and the communists jointly submitted a letter to the Speaker of the Lower House, Herriot, requesting that a treaty of friendship be signed with Germany immediately; at that time, a communist party member, Lachouette, wrote to the Prime Minister requesting to enlist in the army to fill the vacancy of the communist leader who had fled..." Just as he said this, the communist leader, the current Deputy Prime Minister, Thorez, who was sitting opposite, stood up and said, "That's not right, I didn't flee, I held firm to my position as General Secretary of the Communist Party. If you want, I can give you an explanation right now!" After speaking, the seats on the left applauded warmly, and the communist members of parliament stood up and applauded even more, for a long time. (See page 807, line 1 of the French government gazette for details.) Another member of parliament stood up and said, "Mr. Andre, if you have the courage, you should also describe how Thorez directed the Communist Party to attack and occupy the German army!" Speaker Herriot stood up and said, "Mr. Andre, I am doing my best to protect your freedom of speech, but don't talk about anything outside of today's topic. At this time of national unity, we should not waver or divide. If you continue to talk like this, I will have to announce an adjournment. Please finish your conclusion!" At this time, the meeting place was in an uproar. Herriot, seeing that it was impossible to continue, announced an adjournment. The time was exactly 6:40 PM.

(II)

At 7:05 PM, Herriot returned to the Speaker's platform and announced the resumption. Before continuing the discussion, he said, "The conflict just now is really detrimental to the reputation of the meeting place. Mr. Andre's words were obviously outside the topic and violated Article 43 of the parliamentary rules. Now, please pay attention to the following two points: First, Mr. Andre is too accustomed to the old habits of political party struggles and has forgotten the new spirit of national unity and liberation, which is really an insult to the heroic spirits of all parties who sacrificed themselves for the country; second, Mr. Andre insulted a senior government official, the Deputy Prime Minister, and forgot that scolding is always prohibited in the French Parliament, which really gives the national public a bad impression. Moreover, Thorez has held important government positions, not just today. He was initially invited into the cabinet by General de Gaulle, who was most known for protecting national interests. Mr. Andre, I give you three minutes to finish your conclusion." Prime Minister Ramadier stood up to endorse the Speaker's opinion and said: "Crude scolding is absolutely prohibited in parliamentary discussions, because this will be despised by the French people and the world..." Before he could finish speaking, someone shouted: "There's a fight in the aisle!" It turned out that a communist female member of parliament, Mrs. Inyou Lan, who had been sentenced to death by the German army and imprisoned in a concentration camp, heard the insult to the Secretary-General of the Communist Party and, without saying a word, walked out and, when Andre came out, slapped him twice on both cheeks.

Everyone at this time had no idea about the battle outside the venue. The Prime Minister was still saying: "Now everyone should forget the past, unite, and share the responsibility of building the country. Sometimes we are not as good as the heroes of the past, but it is more difficult and takes more time than in the past. The courage required is no less than in wartime. Forget the small conflict just now, because insulting the enemy party is actually infringing on the public."

Before he could finish speaking, another member of parliament rushed to speak. Herriot allowed him, only to hear him say: "Do you all know who Andre is? It turns out that he was a specialist who, during the German occupation, idled in the German-annexed city of Anci, willing to obey French law and German military law, and to purchase Jewish houses under blockade!" After speaking, he read aloud a letter from Andre and the director of the Anci Jewish property management, Stoller, proving that Andre was an opportunist who took advantage of Hitler's sins. How could he be allowed to take the stage to speak! Herriot stood up again and warned everyone that today's debate is of paramount importance to Annam, not only is the national public looking forward to it, but foreigners are also coveting it, and the United Nations General Assembly is also reacting. He hoped that everyone would calm down. Andre was willing to sacrifice his unfinished speech for the best. Andre did not comply, and Herriot said angrily: "Alright then, but you must not deviate from the topic!"

Andre walked back to the stage and immediately complained, "When I walked out of the meeting place just now, I was unfortunately punched and kicked, and my manuscript was scattered all over the ground, trampled on..." The members of parliament on the left could not stop laughing. One said, "The one who hit you was a woman," another said, "She was imprisoned in a concentration camp," and another said, "She was sentenced to death by the Germans!" Andre said: "Please judge everyone, did I say anything outside of the topic?" This caused everyone to laugh out loud. He defended himself, "I was also arrested by the Germans and imprisoned..." At this time, the whole scene was in a complete mess and unable to continue. Herriot announced an adjournment, and the discussion would continue on the 13th. The time was already 7:35 PM.

(III)

At 3 PM on the 13th, the National Assembly reconvened to discuss the Vietnam issue. Herriot first stated: "The hand-to-hand conflict the other day is absolutely unacceptable, and the responsible committee will determine the method of sanctions in detail to make up for the loopholes in Article 43 of the rules of procedure. If any representative is insulted, only the Speaker can stop it, and others must not abuse means to maintain the true face of French freedom." After speaking, he turned to the right and asked, "Mr. Andre, if you have any opinions on Vietnam, you can take the stage to speak. If it is a comprehensive political issue, it will be discussed separately on another day." Andre agreed to only discuss the Vietnam issue. After taking the stage, he criticized the inconsistency within the French government and the error of still tolerating the Vietnamese government's representatives to reside in Paris, and then stepped down.

At this time, another party took the stage to speak. He was Devina of the Left Alliance, a follower of former Governor-General of Vietnam, Varenne. He first stated the importance of Vietnam, such as: "The location of French sovereignty, the safety of 30,000 French expatriates, the maintenance of interests protected for fifty years, the prosperity and order of 25 million natives of different races, languages, religions, and customs, a few elements who have been influenced by Chinese and Western cultures and demand independence, resulting in famine and terror everywhere, the devastation of cities and villages, losses of up to 50 million, thousands of French expatriates dying, tens of thousands of natives disappearing, everywhere the same as in China, rural farmlands and furnaces turned into ruins, so they take risks, resulting in war causing famine, and famine deepening the war. At present, we should first distinguish between 'Vietnam' and 'Viet Minh' as two different things: Vietnam is a geographical name, including the area from Hanoi to Saigon in the three provinces east of the Mekong River; Viet Minh is a political term (the abbreviation of 'Vietnam Independence League', reporter's note), a revolutionary organization with national ideas, which was produced after the last war, founded by Ho Chi Minh. After Ho's entire family was killed by the French, he fled alone to Hong Kong at the age of twenty-five, working as a private secretary for the Russian consul. In 1930, he returned to Vietnam once, and then went to China; then he came to Europe and lived in Paris for several years, deeply influenced by revolutionary ideas, contacted patriots from various colonies together, and participated in the Moscow International Peasants' Congress, where he planned the Annam Revolutionary Youth Party with the aim of eradicating French forces and restoring Vietnam's independence. He was once detained by the British in Hong Kong and then released. When the Japanese army expelled the French on March 9th of the year, they planned to create a puppet empire but failed, and surrendered in August. Ho Chi Minh announced the independence of Vietnam at the Governor's Office in Hanoi on the 20th of the same month, with the speech as follows:

'For eighty years, French colonial figures, holding the tricolor flag of freedom, equality, and fraternity, have forcibly occupied our land, destroyed our nation, and violated justice and humanity. In politics, these French people do not give us any freedom, forcibly establish barbaric legal systems, adapt to local conditions, prevent the unification of our nation, build prisons on a large scale, the number of which far exceeds the schools built, and kill all patriots who love the people in a pool of blood, stifle public opinion, implement dark politics, and use opium and alcohol to demoralize our nation. Based on the above reasons, we solemnly declare to the world that the Vietnamese nation now enjoys the right to freedom and independence.' (The original text can be found on page 827 of this year's French government gazette.) Under this reasonable statement, France sent troops, and Representative Sainteny shuttled between Kunming, Hanoi, and the Chinese garrison to negotiate the agreement of March 6th last year. First, Mr. Moutet obtained permission for the Chinese army to withdraw on February 28th. I would like to express my congratulations to the Overseas Minister here. Then, 15,000 French troops arrived in Haiphong on March 5th. From March to December, French policy wavered between Paris and Saigon, let alone personnel! This resulted in three mistakes: First, poor publicity; second, administrative corruption; third, political ambiguity. The remedy: First, restore order with military force; then, occupy the important points of Vietnam, such as cities, docks, warehouses, mines, and various raw material producing areas; reassign capable personnel to replace the mediocre ones; restore the devastation of the region. It is not too late now, otherwise, if Vietnam breaks away from France, all other overseas territories will not be able to be maintained." After speaking, he stepped down. Then, former Prime Minister Reynaud, who had been defeated by the German army, took the stage, sparking an unprecedented dispute between the left and right wings of the meeting place. The Vietnamese representative to France, D∆∞∆°ng B·∫°ch Mai, was the sole target of his attack.

### Be Careful of Scams When Walking

Last night (the 14th at 9:30 PM), after closing my store, I was walking home because the tram was not coming. When I reached the entrance of the sports field of Aurora University on Rue Luban, there were few pedestrians. Two people in uniform came from the opposite direction, holding a small bag, and intentionally bumped my hand, causing the bag to fall to the ground. Then I heard the sound of glass breaking. They immediately said, "You have no manners when walking!" They immediately opened the bag and saw three wireless light bulbs inside, saying they were bought from Dongxin Bridge and were worth 240,000 yuan. I knew at the time that I had encountered a scam. First, there were few pedestrians on the road, and second, I still had to work tomorrow and had cash and other items with me. I immediately said to them, "I can't afford 240,000 yuan. I only have 50,000 to 60,000 yuan with me. Can we settle it?" Under a state of intimidation and persuasion, they took the money and left.

Although my loss is small, I am afraid that I am not the only one who has been scammed. Therefore, I advise pedestrians to be aware of scams. (Yuan Yiliang)

### A Junior High School Should Be Established in Tangqi, Hang County

Editor: My hometown of Tangqi is a famous giant town in the canal basin, with many students. Students who graduate from elementary school each year and aspire to further their studies must travel to the urban area of Hangzhou. Therefore, most students' parents are limited by their economic ability to cultivate their children, and some have the financial means, but suffer from the fact that the number of school places in Hangzhou is in short supply, and most are disappointed. As a result, such a large town cannot meet the cultural standards. I grew up in this area, with fertile fields and convenient water transportation, which can be called a model area for national construction. I hope that the Zhejiang education authorities will not forget this beautiful town attached to the county seat and plan to establish a junior high school, so that Hang County will not be difficult to become a model county in Zhejiang Province.

### Dujiangyan - Grand Ceremony of Water Release

‚Äî Reporter Zhou Xueduan stationed in Chengdu

Chengdu, 11th (Airmail)

Dujiangyan is located in Guan County, Sichuan, more than a hundred miles west of Chengdu. The project began during the reign of King Zhao of Qin in the Warring States period. The creator was Li Bing, the governor of Shu, more than 2,000 years ago. On the morning of the 5th, the reporter took a special car from the Water Conservancy Bureau from Chengdu. The morning sun was just rising, and the air was refreshing. The Chengdu-Guan County road is the essence of the Sichuan West Plain, a vast expanse of fields, much like Jiangnan, with green trees on both sides of the road, forming shade everywhere. Passing through Pi County, where "three cups of wine from Pi Barrel are enough, no need to buy more," we arrived at Guan County at 10 AM. Guan County is a major city in western Sichuan, and the main trading center for medicinal materials and tea in Sichuan and Tibet. The city is built against the mountain, with a majestic and dangerous terrain. Looking into the distance, the cloud peaks reach the sky, with green everywhere. To the left is Lingyan, and to the right is Mount Qingcheng, the famous Taoist site. Guan County is historically famous as the hometown of Yang Guifei, and there are still the Phoenix Nest and Huanfeng Tower, relics of Yang Guifei.

The Dujiangyan water release is an annual ceremony in Sichuan. Examining the Dujiangyan project, when Li Bing was the governor of Shu during the reign of King Zhao of Qin, there were floods at that time. Bing and his son surveyed the water situation and opened up the Lidui in the Guan County area at the foot of the mountains, diverting the water into the inner and outer rivers, and setting up the Dujiangyan to control the water power, diverting water to irrigate the Chengdu Plain, turning water disasters into water conservancy.

Observing the Sacrifice

The car arrived at Lidui Park in the city, and first went to Fulong Temple to observe the ceremony of sacrificing to Governor Li. The temple is on Lidui, below is the Baopingkou. According to legend, Li Bing subdued dragons here while managing the water, also known as Yongzhu Temple, built against the mountain, majestic and magnificent. The front hall enshrines Governor Li, and the back hall is Guanlan Pavilion. Climbing the pavilion, you can overlook the Baoping and Bibizi Kou. Overlooking the river from the railing, the torrents roll, the waves surge, and the entire Dujiangyan is in full view. The rapids below are surging, like ten thousand horses galloping, the situation is extremely magnificent. The sacrifice was presided over by Deng Xihou, the chairman of Sichuan Province, with the heads of various departments accompanying the sacrifice, using three livestock, burning candles and incense, firing iron cannons, reading sacrificial texts, and performing the most respectful salute. The ceremony was solemn and grand.

After sacrificing to Governor Li, they exited the temple through the Renzi Dam and went a mile or so to the Erwang Temple. The temple is built next to Yulei Mountain, where Du Shaoling's "Jade stacks floating clouds, changing ancient and modern" is located, towering halfway up the mountain, with flying pavilions and dangerous buildings, remotely facing Fulong Temple with its double eaves and complex buildings. It was built during the Jianwu period of the Northern Qi Dynasty, commonly known as the Xianyingwang Temple. Climbing the steps to the temple, at the entrance you can see the six-character formula for water management by the Li family: "Deep pools, low dams," and the eight-character motto: "Meet a bend, cut the corner, meet a straight, draw the heart": This is the guiding principle of water management for two thousand years, and also the most scientific method of water management. Further up is the main hall, with statues of the two kings, wearing brocade robes, which the temple keeper said were bestowed by Qianlong. Behind the temple is a memorial to Ding Wencheng (Baozhen), who made meritorious contributions to water management during the Qing Dynasty. The ceremony was still presided over by Acting Chairman Deng, and the ceremony was the same as that of the Old King.

Clouds Disappear and Mist Dissipates - Open the Water

After the sacrifice to Governor Li and the two Erlangs, the weir was officially opened. The Dujiangyan project stretches up and down for about four miles, divided into (1) the Baizhang Dam and the water diversion dam: located in the uppermost reaches, the purpose is to protect the bank and force the flood to flow into the right path. (2) Dujiang Fish Mouth, that is, the Dujiang main weir, under the Anlan Suspension Bridge, set up the fish mouth to divide the inner and outer rivers. The outer river is the main stream of the Min River, and the inner river draws water from the outer river to form three major tributaries that flow west into the Chengdu Plain. (3) Maca: On the fish mouth, is the gate for diverting the outer river waterway, which is the main object for regulating the water volume. The Maca is a wooden tripod frame, consisting of a number of tripods arranged in rows, filled with pebbles and covered with mud and sand, as a water diversion gate and dam. (4) Leveling Water Tank: Under the fish mouth, it is used to discharge excess water from the inner river. (5) Flying Sand Dam: The inner river water is introduced into the waterway and flows to Yulei Pass. The water flow turns, and this dam is set up to force the water into the Baopingkou. If the water volume in the inner river is too high, it will flow back into the outer river from here. (6) Baopingkou: Is the final section of the project, carved out of the mountain. Water rules are engraved on the rock to record the water volume in the inner river, from four strokes to twenty-two strokes. If the water surface exceeds eleven strokes, the water use in the Sichuan West Plain is sufficient, if it is lower, it is insufficient, and if it is higher, there is a surplus. The Fulong Temple is on the rock.

The central project of Dujiangyan is the fish mouth and Maca. The fish mouth divides the Min River into two. Usually, the water flow in the outer river is vast, and the riverbed is also high, so Maca is set up to isolate the two rivers. When the inner river does not need water, Maca is set up to block the water in the outer river. When the inner river needs water, some Maca are removed, and the water from the outer river flows into the inner river. Opening the water means that the Chengdu Plain needs spring water, and the Maca are officially removed to allow the water from the outer river to flow into the inner river. The total number of Maca is about fifty holes in the outer river (one tripod frame is one hole) and about seventy holes in the inner river. The amount of water needed in the inner river is determined by the number of Maca that are removed.

The water opening ceremony, after the chief officiant burns incense and respects the gods, and fires iron cannons, dozens of laborers successively pull down the Maca (24 holes were removed this year). The flood from the outer river rushes down. In an instant, the shallow inner river, which was only knee-deep, becomes a vast torrent with surging waves. The water opening ceremony is completely completed.

Chengdu-Guan County Road is Lively

The water opening ceremony is the most solemn ceremony in Sichuan once a year. In this theatrical ceremony, there is the highest respect of tens of millions of people. Each grand ceremony must be presided over by the highest administrative person in charge of Sichuan. This year, under the circumstances that the provincial government did not expand the event, the minimum estimate of the number of people coming to watch the ceremony was over 150,000. The irrigated area reaches about 6 million mu. The prosperity of western Sichuan is really dependent on it.

After the ceremony was completed, and after touring the entire Dujiangyan, the original car returned in the twilight. Along the way, on the Chengdu-Guan County road, more than a hundred special cars for viewing the ceremony, carrying more than 100,000 viewers full of admiration, were driving back and forth, which symbolized the unparalleled greatness of Li Bing and his son and the Dujiangyan water conservancy project they created.

Spring and Autumn

### Flying Catkins

‚Äî Reckless

Spring seems to have arrived not long ago, yet it has quietly departed!

Ill and confined to my small room, I'm unaware of spring's tidings. The weather feels warm, and I feel languid; spring must be in full swing. Outside the window, I hear confused and startled bird calls, and delicate green branches hang in the corner. Not a single sign of spring has been missed. But suddenly, something flies in from the window, floating up and down, so light, so soft. It resembles feathers or cotton fluff, and for a moment, I truly can't recall what it is.

Moreover, it's elusive and intangible. What is this? These frivolous and tiny little things have broken into my lonely room?

Oh, it's willow catkins, telling me that "spring" has already left. They hold endless secrets, fearing I don't know that "spring" is gone, so they entwine around me, gently, softly, delivering this melancholy message. I'm both apprehensive and touched because they report this unwelcome news in such a tender way.

Opening the window, I take a closer look at the garden. "Spring" has indeed departed! Look, haven't many trees already "grown green leaves, providing shade, and their branches are full of fruit"? I blame myself for not going out for several days, making me so out of touch. Looking again at the sky, those things resembling feathers and cotton fluff are pervading everywhere, dancing up and down. They demarcate the seasons but also bring melancholy.

I saw willow branches sprouting "greenery" not long ago. I saw willow branches swaying with the feelings of spring not long ago. Suddenly, they send out the signal that spring is leaving. How astonishing is spring's brevity in the human world! I truly want to, like a poetry-obsessed poet, shout that I want to rush to the ends of the earth, catch up with spring, and reside with spring for a while.

### On Pseudo-Qin Tile, Han Brick, and Inscription Hall Seals

‚Äî Li Baifeng

Seeking Truth and Aesthetics

Ever since the Greek philosopher Socrates showed us that art must pursue the three major principles of "Truth," "Goodness," and "Beauty," these have remained the targets for artists for thousands of years. Although seal carving is unique to our country and excels in its own way, it should also be measured against these international standards.

The influence of philology on seal art is immense. Therefore, if seal carvers wish to abandon the foundation of philology, they will be unable to expand the boundaries of their seal carving. After the publication of oracle bone inscriptions by Liu E and Luo Zhenyu, philology itself entered a new era. Scholars such as Rong Geng, Shang Chengzuo, Guo Moruo, and Dong Zuobin have begun using oracle bone script for seals, correcting the errors in Xu Shu's "Shuowen Jiezi" (Explanation of Characters), such as "Áà≤" (wei) and "È¨•" (dou). This is a significant step forward compared to relying solely on bronze inscriptions. (I have a separate book, "Xu Shu Chong's Shuowen Jiezi Explanation and Interpretation," that corrects these errors in detail.)

In his early years, Bai Shishi (Qi Baishi) became famous for his seals. However, he often created seals based on his own ideas without relying on philology. In his later years, he made great efforts to collect and destroy his earlier works. This single example shows that seal carvers should not rely solely on their talent and act independently. A seal belonging to Mr. Bai Chongxi, carved by Bai Shishi himself, features the character "ÁôΩ" (bai) written as "„ÄÄ." This is because the character "ÁôΩ" has too few strokes, so he added embellishments, thus losing its philological basis and becoming untrue.

I am not criticizing the late master Qi Baishi but rather using this as an example to warn future practitioners.

Most seal carvers rely on the book "Liushu Tong" (Comprehensive Six Scripts), like ignorant villagers relying on the "Tongshu" (Almanac). This is like asking a blind person for directions, which is extremely dangerous. The "Liushu Tong" contains numerous seals with many errors and easily confuses bronze inscriptions with Li Si's seal script, leading to serious mistakes.

Seal carvers should have "Duan Yucai's Annotations to Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi," "Wu Dacheng's Shuowen Gu Zhou Bu" (Supplement to Ancient Zhou Script in Shuowen), "Fo Yan's Shuowen Gu Zhou Bu Bu" (Further Supplement to Ancient Zhou Script in Shuowen), "Han Yin Fen Du" (Reading of Han Seals), "Gu Zhou Hui Bian" (Compilation of Ancient Zhou Script), "Leng Gu Zhai Ruan Shi Zhong Ding Yi Qi Kuan Zhi" (Inscriptions on Bronze Vessels and Tripods in the Ruan Collection of Leng Gu Zhai), "Feng Yunpeng's Jin Shi Suo" (Gleanings of Bronze and Stone Inscriptions) and other books for reference. They should also study oracle bone inscriptions from Liu E's "Tie Yun Cang Gui" (Iron Cloud's Collection of Oracle Bones) and Luo Zhenyu's "Yinxu Shuqi Jinghua" (Essence of Oracle Bone Inscriptions from the Ruins of Yin). Only after having a comprehensive understanding of various scripts should they begin carving, to avoid major flaws.

In the art of seal carving, scholars like Wen Sanqiao did not emphasize "beauty" and "truth" as much as we do today. Therefore, they merely imitated the Qin and Han styles. What is there to say about them? I am not a guardian of tradition, so I am not afraid of public criticism and am making this statement publicly.

Only by transcending "preserving truth" can we discuss "aesthetics."

Han seals are square and upright, without regard for the beauty of the seal face, so they are monotonous and follow old patterns without any change. Imitating them would be foolishly carving a mark on a moving boat. The beauty of Han seals lies in their "simplicity and solidity," and nothing more can be said about it. However, during the late Qing Dynasty, Zhao Zhiqian became known for his graceful style, opening up a new era. Those who followed were powerless and became obsequious, which is undesirable.

Zhiqian wanted to continue the style of Wan Baishanren, where "the river flows with sound, a thousand feet along the bank, a unique style in seal carving, and establishing a foundation with clear origins, deserving to be called a master." This seal of Wan Baishanren is similar to Zhao Mengfu's "Songxue Zhai" seal in its origin, feeling detached from vulgarity and emphasizing the structure more than Ding Jing and He Zhen. This seal has a grand and imposing air, like a heavenly horse soaring through the sky, impossible to trace its origins. Blindly imitating it would be foolish, and by Zhiqian's time, later imitators had already reached their limits.

The one who rivaled Zhiqian was Wu Changshuo, known for his "aged" style, using bold strokes, and a craftsman's delicate heart. He was able to handle characters effortlessly and play with them at will, all due to his mastery of calligraphy and painting, which he incorporated into his seal carving, dividing lines and arranging spaces to beautify the whole. His seals such as "Lao Can," "Jun," and "Junqing" are seamless and admirable. In particular, the "Po He Ting" seal opened up a bold new path in seal carving with its three elements of coarseness, strength, and clumsiness. The edges of his seals draw inspiration from broken steles, capturing their spirit and form. Bai Longshanren and Qi Baishi are his followers.

As for Qi Baishi, he still retained the bold style of naivety and simplicity, but it felt somewhat unrestrained and lacked Wu Changshuo's restraint. Qi Baishi's unrestrainedness easily fell into crudeness, and his forceful style easily lost its spirit. Under his influence, the spirit dissipated.

In recent times, Yang Zhongzi and Shou Shigong have made efforts to correct past errors. I once saw a seal by Yang Zhongzi that read "Jiangnan Yang Zhongzi." Although I felt his skill was slightly inferior, it was still full of substance and elegance. Shou Shigong's "Mu Jushi" seal was able to preserve the style of Han seals while showing his own unique style, worthy of being called a master.

When I was young and uneducated, I often saw popular side inscriptions and liked to write small characters, trying to imitate them. My teachers and friends strongly criticized me for this because small characters written with a needle are not suitable for viewing the power of knife and axe. I later discarded it like worn-out shoes. Over the past ten years of wandering, there are still those who value this skill in the market, so I briefly mention it to warn future students.

Side inscriptions must show the knife work to be considered superior. Hiding sharpness and pretending clumsiness are minor paths, so be cautious!

### From Wu Changshuo to Wang Geyi

‚Äî Zheng Wuchang

During the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican era, the one who established himself as a major artist in flower painting was Mr. Wu Changshuo of Anji. Wu Changshuo loved to compose poetry, was skilled in seal carving, and excelled in writing stone drum inscriptions, all of which were majestic, ancient, and powerful, unmatched in his time. He said that he only started painting at the age of fifty. His painting was like his poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving. His painting was not just painting; it was using the artistic conception, brushwork, and spirit he gained from poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving, infused with a majestic spirit. Therefore, he was able to achieve such majestic and ancient power. Looking at Wu Changshuo's paintings and appreciating his poetry, examining his calligraphy, and studying his seal carving, the principles are the same, and the spirit is consistent. Studying Wu Changshuo's poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving may allow one to master his strengths. But if one wants to learn his painting, one must also excel in poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving. Scholars who do not understand this, seeing his bold brushstrokes and heavy colors, and thinking it is easy and unrestrained, blindly imitate him. Thus, they have the form but the face is completely different, or they resemble the face but the spirit is completely lost, painting a tiger but resembling a dog. The Wu style painting has thus been criticized by the public. My old friend Mr. Wang Geyi studied under Wu Changshuo the longest and with the greatest respect. He served him diligently, and he received the true transmission of Wu Changshuo's poetry, calligraphy, and seal carving. Therefore, his paintings, in terms of composition, brushstrokes, conception, and momentum, all follow Wu Changshuo's methods. Once, Wang Geyi visited Wu Changshuo, who was silently leaning on his pillow as if deep in thought. He then got up and stared at the plain paper spread out on the table. After a while, he sat back on the couch and nodded repeatedly. He then got up with a flourish, splattering ink and wielding the brush, as swift as the wind, like dragons and snakes moving, and in an instant, he completed a six-foot screen of wisteria flowers. He laughed and said, "I write with qi, not with a brush." Writing with qi is the secret to Wu Changshuo's painting. Whenever Wang Geyi created something, even a single flower or leaf, he would focus his spirit, concentrate his energy, and cultivate his qi beforehand. Then he would take off his clothes and grind the ink vigorously, moving as swiftly as a rabbit or a falcon, without hesitation or doubt. He splattered ink but cherished it like gold, wielding the brush with strength reaching the tip of the brush. It can be said that he had fully grasped Wu Changshuo's ability to write with qi. During his lifetime, Wu Changshuo gave Wang Geyi his inkstone and techniques, regarding him as the one who would carry on his legacy. Wang Geyi was also able to inherit his teacher's teachings and strive to improve. Over the past ten years, his achievements have become increasingly refined. Now he is presenting two hundred of his carefully composed works for public viewing. I know that readers who read Wang Geyi's paintings will be happy to know that the learning of Anji is now in Haimen.

### Appreciating Mengchan's Calligraphy and Seal Carving

‚Äî Sui Weng

At the gathering of talented individuals, my eyes were immediately drawn to a pair of five-character couplets in official script. The couplet read: "Rituals and music are valued in the imperial court; writing preserves great elegance." It closely resembled Yi Chashou's imitation of Zhang Qian's stele, with a magnificent force that was astonishing. Another couplet was written in small seal script, reading: "Famous paintings should be read like poetic lines; ancient zithers should also be listened to as the sound of water," possessing a sense of fullness and grace.

Mengchan's achievements in seal and official script were already so impressive, but he considered his best to be his cursive script. In his cursive script couplets, I saw the three characters "Bao Mei Yi," and in his seals, I saw the two characters "Mei Pi," suggesting that he had many of Shen Mei Sou's (Shen Zengzhi) works in his collection. Therefore, his cursive script style was lofty and had a divine resemblance to "Hai Ri Chen." I wonder if he also knows Wang Yuanzhong, a professor and student of Shen Mei Sou? According to Wang, Shen Mei Sou's calligraphy could penetrate five layers of Xuan paper, showing the depth of his skill.

The couplets that collected Song Dynasty poems, Jiao's "Yilin" (Forest of Changes), and quotes from others were all appropriate and full of humor. The Song Dynasty poem collections were especially seamless, a feat that Yi Weng also excelled at. I loved his couplet, "Rowing a boat at Red Cliff, on the fifteenth of the seventh month; repairing at the Orchid Pavilion, at the beginning of the late spring," and "If Yelang has talent, it doesn't hurt to be arrogant; if the Xiongnu have not been subdued, how can we have a home?" These two couplets had the feeling of effortlessly creating profound insights.

Finally, let's talk about his seals. His imitation of Zhao Zhiqian's "For five pecks of rice, I bend my waist" seal was so close it was almost indistinguishable. His "Sea Bend General Seal" could be included in the "Collection of Han Bronze Seals." The introductory seals, such as "Bu Cuo Tuo" (Make Up for Lost Time) and "Tian Xing Jian" (As Heaven Maintains Vigor), were not only well-carved but also had deep meaning. The most wonderful seal was "The Number One Madman of Jiangnan," which, together with Bai Jiao's "The Number One Lazy Man Under Heaven," could be called a pair of masterpieces. In reality, Fu Weng (Mengchan) was not lazy at all, and Chi Weng (Bai Jiao) was not mad either.

### Joy

‚Äî Sha Lei

Perhaps the greatest joy is the absence of joy.

Often, I rush towards joy with such fervor, as if giving my whole life or career.

But when I truly face joy, what vast loneliness I feel!

In the constant drawing and drinking of joy, I often feel even more thirsty.

I am gradually becoming intolerant of those cheers, laughter, and orations. I feel that they all belong to the realm of noise.

You see me going to a feast or a date with such difficulty, and I also feel a great weariness towards clothes that are too tidy.

You want me to go with you to travel, to see a play, to take a walk, and I will definitely agree; but can you see that all my expressions are still as they were when we sat facing each other in the small room? What I always see is the light drape of your dark hair, the silent, subtle floating.

The heavenly banquet must also be like our silent sitting facing each other. The things filled and emitted from some dishes and musical instruments must be invisible and inaudible things.

Why do I like you so much, my friend? Because the names of other women are all called "Joy," but you are "Loneliness."

### Wang Geyi's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

‚Äî Pan Boying

The affairs of art rise and fall with the world, reflecting the affairs of politics and the strength of the people. If we speak only of the affairs of art, then although the changes in its trends have an inevitable momentum, the subtle operations of gentlemen should not be ignored. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the style of painting in our country has gradually taken a path of boldness and unrestraint. Crude and sparse imitators have taken the opportunity to disrupt the flow. In extreme cases, even those of craftsman's rank, taking the brush as their body, have stolen high names and clamored for attention. Therefore, the trend will inevitably change to become more careful and solemn, which is the trend of the times. Today, while the realm of carefulness and solemnity is not easily reached, the drawbacks of mediocrity have already arisen. Taking Shanghai as an example, the late styles of the Four Wangs and Wu and Yun are very prevalent. The highest of these only reach to Wen Zhengming, Shen Zhou, Qiu Ying, and Tang Yin. The Four Wangs, Wu and Yun, Wen, Shen, Qiu, and Tang are not bad. But to die under these families is not only a crime against the legalists but also shows that they do not know how to learn well. Although the forms of painting have differences in landscapes, figures, birds and animals, and flowers and plants, the principles for discussing the height of their spirit and charm through brush and ink are the same. Therefore, to break the drawbacks of today's mediocrity, although there are many ways, sweeping away its narrowness with a lively vitality must be one of them. Jin once said that Mr. Wu Changshuo was a noble and erudite scholar who was skilled in poetry and calligraphy. He used his spare time to paint and carve stones. His majestic talent and ancient charm illuminated the world and lived in Shanghai for a long time, but few were able to obtain his transmission of art. This is because those who learn from him have inferior character and cannot learn well, and it is useless to blindly imitate his traces. Therefore, those who follow the herd, relying on their ears as eyes, follow after craftsmen, and their loss is the same as that of mediocrity. Last year, I met Mr. Wang Geyi at the public memorial service at Huifeng Hall. Mr. Wang is a senior disciple of Mr. Wu Changshuo and Mr. Huifeng. I have occasionally visited his noble studio to read his poems and paintings, and I have also seen his collection of Mr. Wu's paintings and calligraphy. After that, I recognized that the method of Mr. Wu was truly present. Su Shi's poem says, "Only after beginning can you know that true freedom comes from refinement; it is not like the mad flowers that delight guests with cleverness." This is what the teacher and disciple of Po He Ting shared and laughed at! Mr. Wang Geyi is now going to present his calligraphy and painting, such as thousands of scrolls, to the connoisseurs of Shanghai. I believe that in order to correct today's mediocrity, break the confusion of superficiality, use the freedom of refinement to seek the true wandering outside of things, Wang Geyi has made a great contribution here. I hope those who know can discuss it together!

### Eulogy for Tan Liming

‚Äî Zhang Shizhao

His heroic spirit suppressed his peers throughout his life, even in illness he still forcefully spoke, stubbornly holding up his head; unwilling to show weakness, his heart was even more detailed, unintentionally aggressive, his reason was truly pursued. He sought friends outside of cliques, especially ashamed to scheme with money; after thirty years of wandering, he retired from the rivers and lakes, his liver and gallbladder shone like the sun and moon.

He treated me as a good friend in times of urgent difficulty, and I was relieved to hear the praises of Jin; shining on people without concealing the moon in his chest, frequently opening his mouth to speak. A gentleman has writing that signifies a leopard's transformation, an official has no place to act like a salamander; a confidant wants to be like Ding Yi, and from now on, I will sprinkle tears on my worn broom.

(Self-note: The two gentlemen told me in their illness that they would sort out my manuscripts for me)

Li Batang said that Liming's sixtieth birthday was celebrated by his colleagues in the Xiemachang courtyard, and they asked me to write an article for his birthday. I had almost forgotten about this, and I am extremely ashamed, so I composed these verses:

The promised word still exists in Xiemachang, watching my friend depart with dignity? Our friendship was originally accustomed to silence, and the writing was all due to old age and illness. Today, I am left with a cry at the gate of the room, and I will keep the Eight Years in the purse, carrying it with me. It is pitiful that his skin and bones are completely broken, but after all, ascending the mountain is better than being in bed.

(Self-note for the phrase "in the purse" refers to avoiding air raids)

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 406

‚Äî Ye Jingfeng

Altogether five people, representing four different groups. Among the five people, only the Korean representative and Zheng Yan had this slight difference in nationality; however, only Zheng Yan had a tenth or twelfth of discomfort in language. This refers to the Chinese national language; the language he usually used was mostly Japanese and Shanghainese.

"First of all, I should probably give a brief report on the situation." Tsurumi, speaking in pure Peking dialect, opened the discussion at this temporary round table meeting. He immediately and without reservation explained his and Pingzi's purpose in coming to Shanghai, "However, I didn't expect that Miss Nakamura, this main character, had not even started working and was already ambushed by someone... Originally, the time was so urgent, only a little more than a day in total, and we didn't know what we should do or how to do it. First, we encountered this setback, which no one expected... Originally, we planned to open Miss Nakamura's document at four o'clock. Now that we have everyone's righteous help, we will take a step back and wait a few hours before talking about it. Now, let's concentrate all our efforts on finding Miss Nakamura... What do you brothers think...?"

"I think there are two ways to handle this matter: a normal way and a discretionary way," said Special Agent No. 2 Li Ming. His reasoning was that "the secret of Eight" was related to the overall situation, and since time was so urgent, it would be better to proceed on both sides, since there was enough manpower. He advocated handling it in a discretionary way, opening Pingzi's letter.

"Looking at the contents of that secret document is also good... Maybe we need more preparation, and while Miss Nakamura's whereabouts have not been found, we can prepare on the one hand - this is if Miss Nakamura must command. If we can all proceed according to the guidance of that secret document, the time may be much more relaxed." This was Shouyi's opinion.

"Anyway, we have to look at it," Tsurumi hesitated slightly, then said to Zheng Yan, "Lao Yan, I have to trouble you again..." He was preparing to call Zheng Yan to go to the Banzai Hall to retrieve the document.

"But the document that the captain hid?... Zheng Yan still spoke in Japanese, "Because he was afraid of another mistake, when the subordinate went there just now, he took it with him, hidden on his body..." As he spoke, he took out the official document sent by the embassy to Pingzi from his shirt, the outer envelope already stained with some sweat.

"Haha..." Tsurumi took the envelope and was preparing to praise Zheng Yan for his "progress in learning," but because there were guests present after all, he retracted his words.

The envelope was opened, and inside was indeed another small envelope, with the words "To Miss Nakamura Pingzi, c/o His Excellency Okamoto, Japanese Ambassador to Shanghai" written on it. There was also a short note from Okamoto to Pingzi;

"One item from the Xiyuan Temple residence, entrusted to thisÈ§® for proper transfer. Because Your Excellency has not visited again, and fearing delay, we especially deliver it with care..."

### The Story of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"

‚Äî Yang Shi

Professor Dodgson of Oxford University stuttered badly and always had trouble speaking to people, but he loved to play with little girls. One afternoon, he led three girls on a boat ride on the Thames River, and the children insisted he tell them a story. Our professor then began to describe an absurd story off the top of his head. It was about a girl who fell asleep in a rabbit hole and woke up to find herself in a strange fairy realm, and she encountered many magical things. They were amazed and asked him to write it down. Professor Dodgson jokingly agreed and spent the night completing it, and named it "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." Alice was the name of one of the three little girls.

After finishing writing, he put the manuscript aside and soon forgot about it. Not long after, a friend saw it and asked him to publish it. The professor said angrily, "Do you think a professor from Oxford would publish something like this?" He refused.

The friend was also curious and published it despite his objections. Unexpectedly, the day it was published, it caused a sensation among the children of London, and it was sold out on the same day. Professor Dodgson could not find a reason why this book was so enthusiastically welcomed by children.

### Snippets

‚Äî Xu Jin

"National Seedlings" and "The Country's Future Masters" - these two titles for children are unanimously supported by fellow countrymen above the age of adulthood.

Raising children's status, increasing children's welfare... these are all routine slogans for Children's Day.

It is not easy for artists to vividly and accurately depict the lively, natural, innocent, and adorable children.

The Gu Family Instructions say, "Teach the wife when she first arrives, teach the child when it is an infant," which proves the importance of childhood education.

On this day of enthusiastically celebrating Children's Day, who can be inspired to show some of the "Love my child, and extend that love to other's children" goodness to the wandering children on the streets?

Children are like a blank sheet of paper, and teachers need to use black ink to write on it the many beautiful historical traces of "Later generations are to be feared, how do we know that those who come after will not surpass us?"

### The Disaster of the Atomic Bomb

‚Äî Dongfang Hui

What are the consequences of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki? To what extent have the disasters caused reached? These are all concerns of medical authorities from various countries.

Dr. Bellus of the University of Chicago led a group of medical personnel (including famous Japanese doctors) to conduct a thorough examination of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Their conclusion was that although eighteen months had passed since the 1945 atomic bombs, their biological effects still existed in the bombed areas, or even continued for several years. They examined and studied many patients who were injured and burned by the atomic bombs at the time, and they found several important consequences of the atomic bombs.

The most mysterious consequence was the formation of special scabs on the skin of those who were burned by the atomic bomb fire. Those who had been exposed to fire or ultraviolet radiation at the time would continue to develop these scabs or scars many months later. The color ranged from pink to brownish-red, distributed throughout the body and face, swollen like elephant skin, and the appearance was terrifying. The skin with scabs was particularly sensitive, causing unbearable pain. The scope of these scabs was not limited to the exposed parts of the injury; they would gradually spread everywhere. Doctors believed that this tissue destruction might be a precursor to tumors, and there was no certainty whether it could be treated with medicine.

Another significant disaster of the atomic bomb was the damage to people's reproductive abilities. Several months after the bombing of Hiroshima, Japanese doctors examined 124 survivors and found that one-third of them had lost their ability to reproduce. The explosion of an atomic bomb could cause the creatures within a three-mile radius of the impact point to lose their reproductive function. Two-thirds of the women in the ultraviolet radiation range of the atomic bomb suffered menstrual disorders, and atomic energy also caused pregnant women to miscarry.

In terms of heredity, it is not yet certain whether the atomic bomb will cause a negative consequence, because this needs to wait until the next generation is born. Some biologists used the fruit flies that breed the fastest in Hiroshima to experiment, but there were no satisfactory conclusions. Some of the children born after the bombing died immediately or were stillborn, and there were no reports of later births. However, doctors firmly believed that some mothers would kill and bury the hideous babies they gave birth to.

This is indeed a terrible disaster. The atomic bomb not only brought disaster to present-day humans, reducing their reproductive functions, but also made the next generation of humans tend to be ugly and in danger of extinction. Who can say that the disaster of "The Last Days of the Ancient City" will not happen again in the world?

### English Scholar Ku Hung-ming

‚Äî Han Guang

Reading "Anecdotes of Ku Hung-ming" in the "Free Talk" section of the April 1st issue made me clap my hands and exclaim in admiration, and laugh incessantly; this old man can be considered a master of humor. Coincidentally, I have in hand an article titled "English Scholar Ku Hung-ming" by Mr. Xie Songgao (published in "Essays of Young China," pages 30-31), which also narrates the life of this old man. Therefore, I translate it and send it to "Free Talk."

"I have never met Ku Hung-ming. I have only heard some things about him and his extraordinary knowledge of English. His Latin was very good, and his reading of English literature was even more extensive.

He had a concubine. He read English literature, but his spirit was thoroughly Chinese. He could not get along with modern Chinese students.

From this, I learned a lesson. We can have a rich knowledge of the English language, and at the same time, we can develop a beautiful English writing style, but we still cannot grasp the spirit of the English people. The spirit of the English people is primarily Christian. They particularly value honesty, purity (no concubines), and a fair love for their friends.

From 1885 to 1905, he served under Zhang Zhidong. He had one wife and one concubine. I don't know if he had any more wives besides that. He was loyal to the Qing Dynasty and always wore a queue.

Mr. Ku was humorous, but sometimes his criticism of others was quite harsh. He was a scholar, but he lacked ideals and a modern spirit. Therefore, it can be said that he was a failure. We must serve the people; when our work fails, we are failures!

I admire Mr. Ku to a certain extent. I hope we can free ourselves from his many weaknesses. Let us use the power of education to benefit the common people. At the same time, let us love only one woman and uphold our noble ideals‚Äîloyalty and democracy."

### ### Happy Child ‚Äî Fortune Favors Him Through Singing

‚Äî Rong Guan

Steel magnate Andrew Carnegie was sitting quietly in the corridor of his office when he heard a child singing. The singing, like a new oriole leaving the valley or a swallow returning to its nest, revealed the child's inner joy through its light and beautiful melody. Because it was a song he particularly loved, especially the child's voice, the child was called before him and often sang for him.

This child was just a stable boy, sweeping the horse gear and cleaning the stable every day while singing this melodious and pleasant song. He worked and sang every day. In this way, his singing reached the ears of the steel magnate not far away. He was promoted and appreciated by Carnegie and became the general manager of Bethlehem Steel Company. His name was Charles M. Schwab.

Drama Review

### ### "Beautiful Women Walking"

‚Äî Ma Gao

The author's two works, "Three Modern Women" and "Beautiful Women Walking," are based on two stages of the national struggle for liberation against Japan, marking typical figures and events of two eras, and their central question is one: "Women, in the struggle for freedom and liberation, women with dual tasks and dual pains." However, the latter has a deeper and newer interpretation and viewpoint.

Here, the author severely condemns Ruo Ying's weaknesses, urging her to abandon her love for material enjoyment and her despicable feelings of bowing her head in compromise. Placing her between Yu Liang and Wang Zhongyuan‚Äîbetween good and evil‚Äîto be tested, she ultimately failed the test and had to wag her tail, begging to enter a comfortable nest. This was inevitable in her path: "compromise." However, the author hopes she can break free from the chains around her neck and give her a "bright tail." This seems a bit forced. For a woman like Ruo Ying, it is probably not easy to stand up straight today, is it?

The encouraged and praised Xin Qun, this female warrior, is brave, capable, and willing to work. She is a model of the ideal new woman, but we still find her not full enough. It seems that we can find more weaknesses of female life in her; she should not be so perfect and great.

The insulted and damaged soul, the female worker Jin Mei, is the most moving and complete character in the author's writing, representing countless women who bear difficult tragic fates. She has blood, flesh, and tears, making people sympathize and sigh. Only when such a person embarks on a new path can people rejoice and bless her from the bottom of their hearts; because those who have endured suffering and become steel are unbreakable in battle.

Such a new type of multi-scene play, appearing on our stage for the first time, gives us a valuable harvest. The honor should go to the director, whose powerful hand integrates the entire play into a new style. The gentle and moving narration, the thrilling accusations, all demonstrate meticulous craftsmanship. The actors are a whole, cooperative and complete. Even the most unimportant roles are performed earnestly and diligently, which is worthy of praise. However, some people's pronunciation is not accurate enough, and the performance is not "pure," with some rough edges.

However, I sincerely recommend this as a fine work that is well worth seeing, with new and valuable gains in script, direction, and acting.

### Rambling Talks on Solitary Mooring

‚Äî Wang Cong

Everyone likes to envy people in positions different from their own. Common people envy officials, while those who dine at court like to adopt nicknames like "fisherman" or "woodcutter." Children envy their grandparents' power and freedom, while grandparents stroke their beards and sigh, "If I could go back sixty years and be as young as this child, that would be true happiness." Men envy women's unearned gains, while women envy men's ability to be active. This tendency shows that everyone is unwilling to think about people in positions different from their own, let alone rationally compare and understand each other's joys and sorrows. The unrest in the world may also be due to this general psychological state.

I think the moon is more fashionable than the sun, perhaps because it is more stingy in bestowing light upon us and because the moon is only full once.

A dry seed will grow and bloom in suitable soil.

A beautiful imagination can cause many changes in real life.

A ray of sunshine is enough to elicit ripples of "understanding."

I boasted to Shen Zhi that the new "understanding" was a huge sun.

Shen Zhi smiled lightly and said, "Because the sunlight is particularly dazzling, you especially like the sun. In fact, the sun is like a star; its hugeness is only due to its proximity. In infinite space, there are infinitely many existences larger than the sun."

Shen Zhi's words have their own logic. However, as far as our world is concerned, I still praise the sun.

### "Extension of Love"

‚Äî L√º Yan

I often see the words "extension of love" in short notes. "Extension of love" was originally an expression of human virtue, but nowadays, it is often misused by the general public, even abused so generously, thoughtlessly, and distortedly.

A friend told me a true story: A certain gentleman, possessing real talent, had been unemployed for more than a year. He wrote countless applications and went to several employment agencies, using up several dozen photos, but was rejected everywhere. Finally, he shyly went to see an old classmate who had been promoted to a "chief" position. Unexpectedly, that classmate generously gave him a letter of introduction, introducing him to a director who owned a large organization. The wording in the letter was sincere, ending with: "Extending love and promoting." After seeing the director, he exchanged another letter of introduction, inevitably "extending love" again. After several twists and turns of "extending love," he received the final letter of introduction, from which he could stop making pointless runs‚Äîthe name on the envelope was none other than his old classmate.

### About War Criminals

‚Äî Zi Ji

The international section of this newspaper on the 22nd had a news item titled "Nazi Arch-Criminals, No Place to Bury Them." It said that the bodies of the ten major Nazi war criminals who were hanged last October, as well as G√∂ring's body, were cremated and placed in military trash cans... Then the cans were placed in the back seat of an ordinary German black sedan and driven straight to the Isar River in Munich, where they were thrown into the rushing river. This was "Hitler's henchmen's greatest journey," and so on.

The trial of Nazi German war criminals has come to an end. The ashes of the demon king were thrown into the river, with no place to bury them, which is truly gratifying.

But looking back at the situation of the remnants of fascism in the Far East, who are stubbornly quibbling and delaying, it makes us sigh endlessly. It is truly, why are we so generous to this side and so stingy to the other?

The establishment of the Tokyo International Tribunal has been a long time, but the war criminals have not yet been sentenced. This not only makes the people of our victorious countries feel impatient, but this pretentious show of the trial has long been regarded as a joke by the Japanese people in the defeated country. Let's look at the Tokyo dispatch from the Central News Agency:

"... The International Tribunal has opened, but when it will end is unknown... It is estimated that this defense case will continue for two months, and the trial may be in mid-autumn... The court employs 400 people and consumes tens of thousands of tons of paper... The Japanese people have become impatient and claim that it is absurd to defend war criminals who cannot be defended. The best policy is to immediately put an end to it. In the eyes of the Japanese people, the trial of war criminals has become a farce."

Human feelings are like galloping horses, and world affairs are like a game of chess. This is a Chinese proverb. Perhaps Japan, although a defeated country, has reached an ideal state and is thriving under the support of the United States. And MacArthur is also charmed by the flattery of the Japanese government and public, so he gives "convenience" everywhere. It's not just war criminals. We have also heard the news that the United States is advocating opening up private trade with Japan and removing "peace industry" electric spinning machines from reparations materials, so as to preserve the Japanese textile industry.

The best articles are yet to come, so watch out. Amitabha!

### Art and Literary Circles

This newspaper published a children's novel "Children's Day" by Fan Quan on April 4th. The article pointed out that on the good day of Children's Day, a large number of children were falling into the abyss of sorrow. The theme is serious, but the narration is extremely humorous and light. When Mr. Zhao Jingshen lectured at Tianen Elementary School, he read the article aloud in public, vividly and vividly, and the listeners all laughed until their stomachs hurt.

### Record of a Besieged City

‚Äî Qin Shouou

"Xiao Rong, your sister likes you. How about letting you sit in a small chartered car and go to Chongqing with Aunt Jin to see your father first?" Turning back, she asked him softly.

"Okay, okay." Rong'er was still young after all. Hearing Lao Zhu say how comfortable the small chartered car was and that he could see his father in Chongqing first, he naturally agreed happily; and when he lived in Xu Shaoming's house, Jin Aili often took him to play, and his impression of her was not bad, so he didn't feel the need to go with his mother.

"That's good too!" Lao Zhu, seeing that this problem was solved, busily continued to pack the bedding that he hadn't finished packing earlier; but Lan was even busier. Fei Fei changed Rong'er, so the clothes had to be reorganized again.

"Mom! Do you want to change a piece of clothing for brother?" Fei Fei glanced at Xiao Rong and suggested to her mother excitedly.

"Okay. Let's put this one on him!" Lan smiled and picked out a set of thin voile children's clothes.

Fei Fei skillfully dragged Xiao Rong to a corner of the room, washed his face and hands, took off his dirty clothes, put on the new clothes, and used a small comb to comb his short hair, without any mess or panic; Lao Zhu repeatedly stretched his legs to look at them, and the shadow of Fei Fei's teenage years immediately appeared in his mind.

At nearly twelve o'clock, Zhu Zhaonian helped Lan pack everything up. A small bedding roll contained a blanket, a thin quilt, and most of Xiao Rong's clothes; in addition, two suitcases, one large and one small, contained what Lan considered to be all the more valuable things in their family. She had originally wanted to add another one, but she was worried that Jin Aili would make things difficult, so she temporarily changed her mind. Zhu Zhaonian strongly agreed with this point, because he really didn't want to bother Zhu Xilong, such a corrupt new bureaucrat, so as not to affect his freedom of speech in the future.

"Brother, why don't you leave Rabbit Daddy here and let me take it away, okay?" When Lao Zhu hired a rickshaw, loaded the luggage, and came back to prepare to take them out together, Fei Fei suddenly made this request to Xiao Rong as if she had thought of a very important matter.

Xiao Rong had already followed Lan close to the door when he heard his sister ask this, but it reminded her instead.

"No! No!" he said, jumping up and down, while turning to look at the bed, his two small eyes widened. "Where's Rabbit Daddy? I want to take him with me! Mom! I want to take him with me!"

He quickly pounced on the bed and picked up the bronze rabbit behind a stack of pillows. Lan didn't have time to grab him.

Fei Fei stared blankly in disappointment, her face full of dejection. (IV) (V)
