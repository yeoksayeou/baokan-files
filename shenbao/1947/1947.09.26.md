### Zhang Qun Delivers a Speech in Beiping, Elucidating Basic Diplomatic Policies, Internally Fearing No Hardship in Implementing Constitutional Governance

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 25th] Premier Zhang Qun delivered a political speech at Yenching University at 10:00 AM on the 25th, elaborating on China's diplomatic and political policies. The title was "Three Threes." Mr. Zhang first clarified China's three basic diplomatic policies: China has always maintained an independent diplomatic stance. To achieve its own independence and freedom, China's diplomatic policy must also strive to achieve this goal and will never blindly follow others. Continue to enhance friendly cooperative relations with allied nations that fought together in the past, including the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France. Promote the international relations between all friendly nations. This is our obligation in the international community. At the same time, from all perspectives, China can only obtain suitable opportunities for development under conditions of overall world peace and stability. Mr. Zhang then explained the implementation of China's independent diplomatic policy: Regarding the use of the veto power, we advocate for flexibility and discretion in its exercise. Excessive use often prevents the passage of good proposals. The United States has proposed an amendment method, but we believe that amending the Charter is too serious. What should be done is to limit the use of the veto power, and the veto power should not be used for constructive proposals. Conversely, the veto power can be used for proposals that violate the spirit of the Charter and are solely for the benefit of local countries. Regarding the Korean issue, we take the desire for Korean independence and freedom as the standard. The 38th parallel divides the complete Korea into two. The Korean people are suffering greatly now. It is said that one to two thousand people cross the artificial 38th parallel every day and flee to other places. Therefore, the Korean people urgently hope to restore their unity and freedom. On this issue, whether it is a Soviet proposal or an American proposal, as long as it can solve the Korean issue and meet the wishes of the Korean people, we support it. However, if the United States and the Soviet Union cannot resolve it, we agree to let the four countries resolve it. Regarding the peace treaty with Japan, we are unwilling to participate in a meeting that the Soviet Union does not participate in, because the Soviet Union has very close relations with East Asia. If the Soviet Union does not participate, it will be difficult to solve many problems. This time, the United States proposed that the draft peace treaty with Japan be drafted by eleven countries, and the Soviet Union advocated that it be drafted by four countries. Our view is that the four of the eleven countries are the countries that have the closest relationship with Japan. Therefore, the countries drafting the peace treaty do not necessarily have to be four countries, but they must include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. As for the voting method, although we agree with the majority vote of the eleven countries, we advocate that two-thirds of the majority must include three of the four countries. Mr. Zhang also put forward three points on domestic political issues: Promote civil rights, end political tutelage, and implement constitutional government. The government will realize this regardless of all difficulties. Reforming politics involves many aspects, such as organizational structure, laws and regulations, personnel system, operating procedures, equipment, and the style and quality of civil servants. Therefore, this is not only a political issue, but also a social issue. The entire social atmosphere must be changed. Military administration, such as the establishment of systems, reorganization of the army, and the establishment and reform of military power and responsibilities, must also be greatly enhanced.

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 25th] Premier Zhang Lin met with reporters at Yishoutang in the Summer Palace on the 25th at noon, stating: China has its own independent and autonomous diplomatic policy, which will never change due to whether or not others provide assistance. Mr. Sun Zhesheng's recent conversation with a reporter from the Associated Press, its most important meaning is only to emphasize the autonomy of Chinese diplomacy. A reporter asked whether China is willing to mediate to shorten the distance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Zhang replied: Yes. The reporter asked whether Petrov would return to China. Zhang said: The Chinese Embassy in Moscow has processed the visa for the Soviet Ambassador, and the date of the Soviet Ambassador's return to office should not be far away.

### Mr. Zhang Holds a Tea Party to Entertain University Presidents and Professors, Today Going to Zhangjiakou for Inspection, Trip to Taiyuan Canceled

More than 200 people, including Hu Shi, Mei Yiqi, and Wang Zhengting, attended. Mr. Zhang said in his speech: This trip is willing to see more, listen more, and unwilling to say more. Mr. Zhang reiterated the valuable suggestions of educational workers to the government at the Lushan Talks before the July 7th Incident, and is willing to learn from them to help solve the current difficult situation. He then briefly explained the current difficult situation of the government and its administrative policies, emphasizing the reflection on the shortcomings criticized by others, reaffirming the independent diplomatic policy, and asking all parties to understand this financial difficulty, and revealed that the salaries of public educators will be adjusted again in November. Subsequently, Hu Shi delivered a response on behalf of the attendees. He said: Under the current situation where we cannot get enough to eat and wear, we only hope to explain the principles of salary adjustment. Mr. Hu reiterated and explained the two principles (see page 9 of yesterday's newspaper) decided by the Peking University Faculty Association on the 23rd, saying that he hoped that these principles could be extended to general public educators, so as to maintain a minimum standard of living, and requested the allocation of food, coal, and cloth in kind. Subsequently, Wang Zhenrui, director of the Department of Psychology at Yenching University, made supplementary explanations. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

### Legislative Yuan Suggests the National Government Discuss and Handle the National Federation of Commerce

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The Legislative Yuan believes that the National Federation of Commerce published a large advertisement in the newspaper, openly insulting the National Government and the Legislative Yuan. During the meeting last week, Legislator Chen Guyuan made a temporary motion to suggest that the National Government impose sanctions. The case has been passed by the 334th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan today, and it was resolved to suggest that the National Government instruct the competent supervisory authority to discuss and handle it in accordance with the law. When the case was brought up at the meeting today, the original proposer, Chen Guyuan, stood up and explained briefly that the Legislative Yuan's proposal of this case is to maintain discipline and is justified. The government should instruct the competent supervisory authority to discuss and handle it in accordance with the law. Liu Butong said: "In recent years, merchants have become increasingly arrogant and unusually domineering. Most of the government's tax revenue is taken from farmers, and occasionally taken from merchants, who use petitions and strikes as a threat. If this continues, it is really unbearable. This behavior fully demonstrates their arrogance. I still maintain that the activities of the Chamber of Commerce should be suspended, reorganized in accordance with the law, and the few responsible persons in Shanghai should be punished." Liu Zhiping, Chen Haicheng and others also expressed their opinions.

The original voting date is imminent, and the nomination procedures for candidates from various units have not yet been completed. Even the various units under the Kuomintang have failed to report on schedule. As for the party nominations discussed by the three parties, there is no result yet, so the deadline for the three parties to jointly nominate candidates for the National Assembly representatives on the 27th of this month has to be extended. The Central Election Guidance Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 25th and decided to postpone it for 10 to 20 days.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The case of increasing the quota of National Assembly representatives and legislators for industry and commerce groups was passed by the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 25th, and the allocation method has also been decided. According to the original quota of 31 National Assembly representatives for industry and commerce groups, the State Council decided to increase it to 48 at the meeting on the 12th of this month, and this case has now been passed by the Legislative Yuan. As for the allocation method, the suggestion of the Ministry of Social Affairs was adopted, and it was decided that there would be 44 commercial representatives, including four women representatives, and 24 industrial representatives, including two women representatives. The original quota of legislators for industry and commerce groups was 15, and the State Council decided to increase it to 20 at the meeting last month, and the Yuan also passed it without objection. As for the allocation method, there will be 10 for commercial groups and 10 for industrial and mining groups. In addition, the conference discussed the following important cases related to elections: National Assembly Quota Allocation Table. The remarks in the table of representatives elected by women's groups should the restriction "National women's groups are limited to those who have more than five branches in each province and city and whose membership books of each branch have been filed with the Ministry" be removed? After this case was raised, Liu Ke explained it first, saying briefly: According to the People's Organization Law, national people's organizations are not required to have five branches. In addition, time is short, and it is too late to organize now. It seems appropriate to delete it. Female legislator Tan Tiwu argued strongly, believing that it was impossible, and pointed out that since it is called a national women's group, it should have branches in various places. If a few people in Nanjing use family or personal relations to organize a group under a false name as a tool for future elections, it would be unreasonable and inconsistent with the initial intention of promoting women's rights. Several male legislators had different opinions, and the final resolution was to retain the remarks, that is, national women's groups are limited to those who have more than five branches. Amendment to Articles 5, 6, and 10 of the Supervisory Committee's Election and Recall Regulations and Article 11 of the Implementing Regulations. There was a heated debate on Article 10 during the discussion, which lasted for an hour.

The others were passed according to the review opinions. Amendment to Articles 21 and 25 of the Implementing Regulations of the Supervisory Committee's Election and Recall, passed according to the review opinions, without the need for amendment.

### Government to Issue Huge Sum to Build Xinjiang Industry, Military Control Zone Headquarters Established in Dihua

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 25th] The Chinese government is following the Truman Doctrine and planning a "money" policy in hopes of alleviating ethnic rebellion in Xinjiang Province. This is the new five-year construction plan drafted by Zhang Zhizhong and Maisiwude. According to the Information Bureau, Zhang Zhizhong has submitted the plan to Chairman Jiang for approval by the Executive Yuan. Mr. Zhang admitted that the purpose of the plan is to improve the people's living standards and alleviate the opposition between the government and the Yili ethnic group. It is reported that the government has approved an appropriation of 25 billion to carry out the plan, which will first develop the province's hydropower, steel, coal, and gold mining industries.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] According to the military news agency, the Ministry of National Defense has been approved to set up a military control zone headquarters in Xinjiang, which has been officially established in Dihua.

### Government Employee Living Loan Case, Legislative Yuan Resolves to Re-Submit for Review

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The case of living loans for public educators was raised again at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 25th, causing a heated debate. Because it involved the construction loan issue, the list of loans for officials and dignitaries was announced in public, causing a great uproar. Finally, because the loan method was not easy to implement, it was resolved to re-submit it for review. In order to gather ideas, the Political Participation Council and the Control Yuan will be invited to jointly discuss a good and easy-to-implement method. After this case was raised at the meeting today, Liu Tong, chairman of the Finance Committee, first reported on the review process, saying that the current public educators are indeed on the verge of not being able to eat enough or live, which has a significant impact on work efficiency. This phenomenon cannot be ignored. Chen Guyuan pointed out that paying salaries according to the cost of living index is definitely not something the national treasury can afford. It would be easier and more effective to issue government employee bonds. Chen Hong believes that there are many difficulties in the loan method. Instead of changing it, it is better to directly solve it simply. However, if calculated according to the cost of living index, the national financial resources cannot afford it. He suggested that the basic salary system should be based on 50 yuan, and issued according to the cost of living index. For those above 50 yuan, the situation should be considered separately and issued with a discount. He expressed deep dissatisfaction with the uneven treatment among government agencies. A driver of the Executive Headquarters earns 2 million to 3 million yuan per month, while a legislator earns less than 2 million yuan. How can it be fair? The original proposer, Liu Zhiping, cited the information on construction loans from the China Trust Bureau provided by the Four Joint Offices, and said with emotion: Rich and powerful officials are already rich and noble, and the government still provides huge loans to build huge buildings, while our poor civil servants have no way to appeal and lack the means to make a living. It is said that the government's purpose in lending money to build houses is to prosper and beautify the city. The city needs to be beautiful, but can we bear to see us starve and freeze to death? After speaking, he asked Secretary-General Lou Tongsun to announce the list in public. Many of them were rich and powerful officials who had land and houses. The loan amount was usually 200 million per household, and the least was 40 to 50 million. As soon as his report was completed, Liu Butong jumped up to speak, greatly indignant, saying: This kind of low-interest loan only benefits the rich and powerful officials. Why not extend it to all poor civil servants? Sun Jiulu advocated that this kind of loan should be investigated. As for the adjustment of civil servant salaries, it is a matter of urgency. However, the current government under the leadership of Premier Zhang does not pay attention to the rising prices and the suffering of civil servants caused by the rising prices. It should be suggested that the National Government instruct the Executive Yuan to seek a reasonable solution. Chen Xiaocen, who had just returned from inspections in various places, pointed out that the salaries of civil servants in the inland areas are so low that some only earn 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per month. How can they not disturb the people? The basic reason for the darkness in the countryside lies in this, and it should be remedied as soon as possible. Xia Taosheng advocated that most of the housing loans have not yet been lent out, and it should be prohibited from being lent to private individuals who already have them, and should be allocated for the construction of dormitories for public educators. Wang Yuqun, who is proficient in accounting, estimated that a loan of 200 million in Shanghai could earn 30 million per month. The rich build more houses, and the poor have no houses to live in. Can it be said to be fair? Hong Ruizhao also said with emotion, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the Executive Yuan's disregard for the lives of public educators, believing that the Executive Yuan should not continue to "abuse" civil servants. He advocated that Premier Zhang be invited to the Yuan to explain. President Sun also spoke, believing that running a government employee credit loan is a bookish method that will not work. Loans must have collateral. What can civil servants use as collateral? Can they use their salaries as collateral? The country owes a debt to civil servants, and it should never change the situation so that civil servants are responsible to the country. As for paying salaries according to the cost of living index, it will inevitably accelerate inflation by 50,000 times, and it will definitely not work. It is better to adopt the basic salary system suggested by Committee Member Chen Hong, which is easier to implement. The original loan method should be canceled, and the original case should be re-submitted for review. In order to gather ideas, the Political Participation Council, the Control Yuan, and other agencies should be invited to jointly discuss a proper and easy-to-implement method. President Sun's suggestion was applauded at the meeting. The original proposer, Liu Zhiping, also expressed his acceptance and passed it immediately, and re-submitted it for review.

### Adjusting the Salaries of Public School Teachers and Civil Servants: The Control Yuan Proposes Two Methods to Ensure Government Officials Maintain the Same Standard of Living

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] "A proposal to adjust the salaries of public school teachers and civil servants to maintain their livelihoods and consolidate the foundation of the nation" was passed by the Control Yuan's morning discussion meeting on the 25th. More than 20 members of the Control Yuan signed the proposal, which was then submitted to the Executive Yuan. The proposal was drafted by three members of the Control Yuan, Wan Can, Li Shijun, and Yu Shude, and contains two proposed methods:

First Method [Principle]: Adjust salaries to bring general public school teachers and civil servants closer to the standard of living enjoyed by civil and military officials with special privileges, demonstrating equality. [Reason]: Currently, the hardships faced by general public school teachers and civil servants who are honest, law-abiding, and self-disciplined have reached a desperate point. Meanwhile, civil and military officials with special status rely on various advantages, their livelihoods not dependent on their salaries. Cunning individuals even exploit their positions to embezzle and plunder, leading extravagant lives. For the sake of stabilizing the livelihoods of public school teachers and civil servants, improving administrative efficiency, and revitalizing discipline, it is imperative to quickly adjust the salaries of general public school teachers and civil servants. [Methods]: Currently, the cost of living index has risen to over 50,000 times the pre-war level. According to official statistics, it has risen to 31,000 times. Salaries can be issued at half the official index, i.e., 15,000 times. Thereafter, adjustments should be made monthly, based on half the officially published index at the time. Based on the standard of base salary, stipends should be provided according to different levels of the monthly cost of living index. For example, those with monthly salaries below $30 should be paid according to the cost of living index; those with salaries between $31 and $50 should be paid at 80% of the index, and so on.

Second Method [Principle]: Equalize salaries to bring the standard of living enjoyed by civil and military officials with special privileges closer to that of general public school teachers and civil servants, sharing both joys and hardships to overcome the difficulties. [Methods]: Regardless of official rank, the clothing, food, housing, transportation, medical care, education, and entertainment of the individual and their family should be provided equally by the state. In addition, each person should be given a monthly allowance equivalent to 20% of the cost of living index. Regardless of official rank, everyone should live at the same standard, enduring hunger and cold together, as is currently practiced in England. At a minimum, the following points must be achieved: Senior officials should enjoy the same standard of living as general public school teachers and civil servants. General public school teachers and civil servants should enjoy the same standard of living as employees of state-owned enterprises. Employees of private enterprises should enjoy the same standard of living as public school teachers and civil servants. Implement absolute rationing of all daily necessities. Prohibit the circulation and use of all luxury goods. Excess private property and resources should be requisitioned or borrowed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Hong Xiang, a former lieutenant colonel staff officer in the Bereavement Committee of the Military Affairs Commission, and currently a lieutenant colonel staff officer in the Bereavement Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, took advantage of the reorganization of the Bereavement Committee into the Bereavement Department in October of last year, when he was assigned to clear up backlog cases. He extracted over 50 bereavement payment orders from old cases that could not be delivered and had been returned. He forged the seals of the deceased's families, official seals of institutions, and postal dates, and fraudulently claimed bereavement payments for 55 deceased personnel, including Zhang Liangji, from the bereavement payment disbursement group, totaling over 37 million yuan. The military court of the Joint Logistics Headquarters investigated and confirmed the facts. After several interrogations, the accused confessed. He was executed by firing squad in Beijing at 9:00 AM today, with the approval of the authorities.

### State-Owned Enterprises to Be Sold Off More Quickly; Valuation of Twelve Units Completed; Full Economic Commission Resolves to Submit to the Supervision Committee for Review

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The 16th meeting of the National Economic Commission was held at 3:00 PM on the 25th, chaired by Wang Yunwu. Resolutions were as follows:

Reporting Items: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's plan to increase grain production was approved at the 8th meeting and submitted to the Executive Yuan, which returned it with two points for discussion: (A) Can existing institutions be used to absorb personnel? (B) The allocation of project funds. After gathering the relevant departments of agriculture and forestry on September 2nd and September 9th for thorough discussion, it was decided to use existing institutions such as the Central Agricultural Extension Committee, increasing the number of technical personnel from 1,200 to 1,600. The total cost for the two years was set at 120 billion yuan. Regarding the calculation method for adjusting the prices of public utilities, many details still need to be thoroughly reviewed.

Discussion Items: The Executive Yuan submitted a draft amendment to the inheritance tax law submitted by the Ministry of Finance. The meeting conducted a general discussion on the principles and resolved to appoint six committee members, Yu Hongjun, Xu Kan, Liu Zhendong, Deng Feihuang, Chen Fang, and Sun Longji, to conduct a preliminary review. Regarding the issue of accelerating the sale of state-owned enterprises, the valuations of twelve units have been submitted to the meeting. It was decided to submit the valuations of these twelve units to the State-Owned Enterprise Sales Supervision Committee for review. (It is said that the valuation for the sale of the China Textile Company will be submitted to the meeting by the end of the month.) The meeting also conducted a general review of the price issue, which lasted a long time.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] During the discussion of the draft amendment to the inheritance tax law at the regular meeting of the Full Economic Commission, it was generally agreed that inheritance tax is a good tax and should be levied. However, the original draft has been in existence for too long, and many aspects are inconsistent with the current situation. For example, the Ministry of Finance proposed a starting point of 30 million yuan, but at the current value of 30 million, almost everyone has that much, and levying tax on everyone would inevitably disturb the people. At the same time, there is no investigation of property in our country, and the Law on the Use of Names passed by the Legislative Yuan has not been implemented, coupled with the fact that Chinese people have no habit of paying inheritance tax, there are many difficulties, and it seems that these have not been considered in the articles. There are also no explicit provisions for rewarding self-reporting, and methods should be found to remedy these. Some at the meeting also argued that inheritance tax should not be levied, but this did not gain widespread support.

### United Relief Association Approves Loan for Shaanxi Cotton

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The United Relief Association held its 353rd board meeting on the morning of the 25th, with Yu Hongjun acting as chairman.

### Goods Shipped to America by Overseas Chinese Merchants Detained for Poor Quality; Chinese Chamber of Commerce in San Francisco Demands Return

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 24th] Overseas Chinese merchants here held a meeting at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce last night to find ways to request the United States to return the pure food, drugs, and cosmetics that they imported into China. Our Consul General Zhang Zichang guaranteed his assistance in seeking a solution. Several American customs brokers are also working to release the goods currently detained in the port. Authorities released the following reasons for detaining the pure food and drugs: Most of the goods are stale and rotten. Infested with insects and partially rotten. Unauthorized dyes. Chinese medicines contain unapproved treatments and no ingredient labels. No English labels. Among the food items, sausages, preserved duck stomachs, etc., are mostly moldy, rotten, and infested with insects. During the four-hour discussion, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce decided to translate the reasons for the detention into Chinese and send them to Chinese manufacturers, transporters, and exporters for future reference. Currently, many goods have been frozen here. The authorities will generally decide on the interpretation of other ports in the United States. If the bureau decides to reject these imports, it will surely ruin the livelihoods of some Chinese merchants. Otherwise, Chinese manufacturers and exporters must quickly improve their products in accordance with US regulations.

Editorial

### The Movement to Conserve Should Begin in Shanghai!

Since the government announced the "Strictly Implement Economical Consumption Measures" last month, various sectors in Shanghai have organized a propaganda committee to expand the promotion of conservation, aiming to ensure that over four million citizens of Shanghai understand the essence of conservation and can put it into practice. The committee is scheduled to hold a city-wide conservation propaganda conference this morning to raise public awareness and thereby shift social attitudes. We have observed that the effectiveness of the "Economical Consumption Measures" has not been significant since their implementation on September 1st. Therefore, we believe that today's city-wide conservation propaganda conference holds particular importance and deserves the attention of all citizens.

Our society has traditionally promoted frugality as a virtue for self-cultivation and conduct. The saying "Frugality nurtures well-being" implies that whether it is family education of children or the misleading of young people, "frugality" is the foundation for cultivating oneself. Even in Chinese rural society, the spirit of simplicity and sincerity is still maintained. However, in Shanghai, due to its abnormal development, an extravagant and dissolute atmosphere has emerged. For over a century, Shanghai has been a concession, under foreign rule. Due to the vast differences between Chinese and foreign customs, it has become a decadent "ten-mile foreign field", indulging in extravagant pleasures. Not only is luxury admired, but morality has also declined, turning it into a breeding ground for all evils. During the War of Resistance, the rear areas implemented a general mobilization of the spirit, but Shanghai, being in the occupied area, not only failed to be inspired by this mobilization but was instead poisoned by the enemy and puppet regimes, causing Shanghai to become even more degenerate. After the victory of the War of Resistance and the restoration of Shanghai, the atmosphere in Shanghai could have changed and been renewed. However, people mistakenly believed that after the victory of the War of Resistance, it was time for the end of suffering and the beginning of happiness. Therefore, in their lives, they sought comfort, which led to extravagance. Any foreigner who comes to China for the first time, upon arriving in Shanghai, almost cannot believe that China is a poor country. This abnormal state, from any perspective, is unacceptable even during peaceful times of prosperity, let alone during this most difficult period of suppressing rebellion and building the nation.

Our country is originally a backward agricultural nation, extremely poor economically. After eight years of arduous war, it has become even poorer. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and national industries cannot rise. If there were no internal troubles and the nation's strength could be focused on reconstruction, human effort would surely overcome fate, and our country would have a bright future. However, unfortunately, the communist bandits disregard the nation's lifeline, rebel by force, destroy transportation, and ruin production, not only attempting to seize power by force but also to plunge the Chinese economy into a bankrupt state. Fortunately, the government recognized their treachery and resolutely ordered mobilization to suppress the rebellion, and issued measures to strictly implement economical consumption, so that the entire country, from the government to the people, can concentrate all efforts on suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. All patriotic people should be mindful of the difficulties of the times, restrain themselves, and serve the country, based on the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength", sacrificing the individual for the sake of the greater good, and completely dedicating everything to the country. There should be no talk of personal enjoyment. Faithfully implementing the government's conservation measures is the responsibility of the people to the country, and there is no room for expressing opinions. In recent days, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been holding its fourth congress, and some councilors have raised suggestions regarding the "Economical Consumption Measures", which compels us to urge them to pay attention: economical consumption has now become a national policy and is not subject to further discussion in principle. At most, there is room for consultation on the technicalities of implementation. Taking the prohibition of dancing as an example, the immediate implementation will inevitably cause tens of thousands of dancers and employees who depend on it for their livelihood to lose their jobs. We should, of course, find ways to resettle the unemployed to avoid causing unrest in Shanghai society, but we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater; we cannot fundamentally oppose the ban on dancing simply because we cannot solve the unemployment problem of these people. Soldiers on the front lines are fighting to suppress the rebellion, and people in disaster areas are struggling on the brink of starvation, while Shanghai alone is enjoying peace and prosperity with singing and dancing. Imagine what this stark contrast will become? How can we still talk about economical consumption?

There is a very common saying in our society, "One must endure the greatest suffering to become the greatest among men." People who start from scratch do not succeed by chance; most of them rely on their own diligence and frugality to build a career. The same applies to the nation as to the individual. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan was successful in four years because the Soviet people were able to tighten their belts, using all the nation's resources and manpower entirely for the Five-Year Plan, without wasting a single penny. Even today, the Soviet Union is working hard, hoping to restore the pre-war state as soon as possible. The Soviet people's frugality has accelerated the success of national construction, which is an excellent example for us to follow in implementing conservation. The second example is today's Britain and France. Britain is an island nation, and normally relies on imports for its food and clothing. However, after the war, due to economic difficulties and reduced sources, the British people have faced extremely severe difficulties in their lives. Therefore, Britain implemented conservation measures and still maintains the rationing system implemented during the war. Regardless of rich or poor, noble or humble, everyone buys goods with ration cards. After the war, Britain was able to safely overcome economic difficulties because the entire British people were able to tighten their belts, endure hunger and cold, and persevere. As for today's France, under the threat of the US dollar, everything is simplified. Paris, which was known as a "money-burning pit" before the war, is still dull today. But looking back at Shanghai, its superficial prosperity is far greater than before the war, and the waste of manpower and resources has reached its peak. What reason do we have to allow Shanghai to continue to waste like this?

In conclusion, during the period of suppressing rebellion and building the nation, the entire people should conscientiously implement economical consumption. The general impoverished farmers, struggling on the brink of starvation, have already conserved to the point where they cannot conserve any further. However, in large cities, especially Shanghai, where the wealthy gather, extravagance and dissipation have become a social atmosphere, and daily consumption is truly astonishing. Shanghai should first conscientiously implement conservation measures. Indeed, "The richness or thinness of customs depends on the hearts of one or two people." Although we also hope that municipal authorities and social leaders will take the lead in practicing conservation and set an example for the people, we believe that the key to success or failure lies in the citizens of the city. Only when everyone implements economical consumption measures together will it be effective; otherwise, it will all be superficial and merely for show, and will not be effective. Therefore, we must loudly advocate that implementing conservation should start in Shanghai. If this movement cannot be effective in Shanghai, then this is the shame of the citizens of Shanghai.

### Europe's Food Crisis Cannot Be Ignored by America - Truman Calls for Conservation, Also Invites Latin American Countries to Participate in European Aid Efforts - No Special Session of Congress is Planned

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 25th - President Truman today continued to urge the American people to do their utmost to avoid wasting food, in order to relieve Europe's food shortage this winter. He is seeking to provide Europe with transitional assistance, without planning to convene a special session of Congress. Convening a special session of Congress is not a simple matter, and Europe's need for assistance is truly urgent. Truman will meet with congressional leaders next Monday, and the issue of providing rapid aid to Europe will be the main topic of discussion. Today, Truman ordered the establishment of a Citizen's Food Committee, whose task is to conserve and preserve food, so that America can have the ability to assist Europe, as America cannot stand by and watch Europe freeze and starve. Luckman, General Manager of Lever Brothers Company, has been appointed Chairman of the Citizen's Food Committee. Truman's request for the American people to conserve food does not mean asking the American people to reduce their food intake. The main point is to reduce waste. It should be noted that Americans waste as much as 70 million tons of wheat each year by discarding leftover bread. Some asked whether America would restore price controls, and Truman replied that this depends on the attitude of Congress. Others asked whether America would restore the rationing system, and the President said that a decision would be made after a detailed investigation of the actual situation. Truman hopes that Latin American countries will also bear part of the costs of the Marshall Plan, and the US government will seek consultations with Latin American countries. In short, all countries with surplus food should generously help others in need.

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Truman convened a special cabinet meeting today to review the food situation. The President also held talks with Agriculture Secretary Anderson, discussing the international food situation and domestic agricultural issues. Today, Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft said in Seattle that congressional leaders have been recalled to the White House and are scheduled to discuss the food issue with Truman on the 29th. It is said that his office has intercepted the notice, but he will not be able to complete his four-part trip until October 2nd, so he will not be able to attend. Vandenberg will represent the Senate Republicans at the meeting.

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett said on the 24th that the British government has [fully mobilized] all appropriate facilities to begin work on the Marshall Plan report submitted by the Paris Conference. He said that several experts drafting plans for European needs have been invited to Washington in October to meet and provide more information on the Paris report. He said that Marshall is now submitting this report to President Truman.

### After the Report from Sixteen Countries Arrives in Washington, The First Reaction from Congress - Speaker of the House Argues for Serious Consideration

[United Press International, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 25th] Speaker of the House Martin said last night at the Milwaukee Auditorium to Wisconsin Republicans that Congress will insist that any US economic aid should be based on the receiving country's sincere expression. Those who wish to receive US aid must prove that they have gradually relied on their own intelligence, resources, and production. Relying solely on US dollars is not enough to accomplish this task. Past US aid has cost huge sums of money, but has still failed to achieve European recovery and self-sufficiency. Future aid to foreign countries should be properly allocated and supervised. In addition, the major problems facing the future Congress include taxation, prices, and housing.

### British Trades Union Congress Supports Export Plan

[Reuters, London, 24th] The British Trades Union Congress, representing seven million workers, after a meeting of the Council today lasting three and a half hours, issued a declaration calling on workers across the country to devote their full efforts to production, in order to achieve the government's set export targets. The Council reviewed the export plan of Commerce Secretary Cripps, and decided to send notices to all national unions to engage in full cooperation to complete the government's targets.

### Nazi-Looted Gold to Be Initially Distributed

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th] US Acting Secretary of State Lovett announced today that the US-UK-France Gold Commission has agreed to make an initial distribution of gold previously looted by Germany and now recovered by the Allied forces, to cope with the European economic crisis. This batch of gold totals $260 million. In addition, the Allied forces recovered another batch of gold worth $70 million in countries formerly ruled by Germany, but the distribution of this gold is still awaiting final decision. Lovett said when announcing the Commission's agreement that, due to the need to retain reserves to meet unforeseen needs, only half of the total amount of $330 million can be distributed immediately. Lovett continued that, although the distribution of this huge sum of gold cannot eliminate the need for Western European countries to obtain excessively emergency aid from the United States, the financial situation of France and other countries will be greatly improved as a result.

### UN General Assembly Political Committee Sits Together - Pakistan and Yemen Join

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 24th] The UN General Assembly Political Committee today unanimously passed a resolution by a vote of 35 to 0 to recommend to the General Assembly that the Dominion of Pakistan and the Kingdom of Yemen be admitted as members of the United Nations. At the beginning of the meeting, Bolivian representative Reyes was elected as Vice-Chairman of the Political Committee, and Danish representative Federspiel was elected as Secretary. The first item on the agenda passed by the Political Committee was the Balkans issue, followed by the US proposal to establish a 55-nation Peace and Security Committee, the Soviet proposal to punish war criminals, the Korean independence case, the amendment of the Charter, the South African Indian treatment case, and the veto issue.

### France Opposes Operation of Ruhr Coal Mines by Germans

[Reuters, London, 24th] Authoritative sources report that French Ambassador to Britain Massigli submitted a letter to the British Foreign Secretary today, stating France's views on the Anglo-American temporary agreement on Ruhr coal mines. The agreement stipulates the establishment of an Anglo-American Ruhr Coal Mines Bureau to implement supervision, while also entrusting the operation of Ruhr coal mines to Germans. It is understood that France's recent opinion letter has not withdrawn its opposition to entrusting the operation of Ruhr coal mines to Germans. In addition to raising criticisms, France also expressed concerns about the future of these mines, which have French commercial interests, and reserved its position on the transfer of operation to Germans. The Dutch government's opinion letter on this agreement is still being studied by the British Foreign Office.

### US Treasury Secretary Arrives in Germany

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] US Treasury Secretary Snyder arrived in Berlin by plane from Paris this afternoon. US military commander General Clay and his economic advisor Bennett personally welcomed him at the airport. Snyder told reporters that he came at Clay's invitation and will meet with those responsible for US military zone control. He will return to Paris in two days.

### US Plans to Submit Detailed Rules Proposal for Establishment of 55-Nation Standing Committee to UN General Assembly Political Committee for Discussion

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 25th] It is reported that Secretary of State Marshall's proposal to establish a 55-nation Peace and Security Committee has been drafted into detailed rules. It will be submitted to each delegation of the UN General Assembly on Thursday for study. This plan will be presented to the UN General Assembly Political Committee for discussion by US representative Dulles, an expert on Republican foreign policy issues.

It is heard that this detailed rules proposal is sufficient to address various criticisms inside and outside the UN General Assembly regarding Marshall's proposal. The matters that the Peace and Security Committee can discuss have been carefully restricted, in order to avoid, as the French representative said, that this committee will induce countries to submit all new and old disputes to the committee without attempting to resolve them outside the committee first. Some countries with colonies are also concerned that the committee will usurp the powers of the Trusteeship Council and induce many independence movements. The US detailed rules proposal has taken into account the above points, so it will make the committee a true peacekeeping organization, rather than a venue for countries to engage in propaganda. The functions of this new committee are expected to be: 1. Reviewing situations and disputes that hinder friendly relations between countries; 2. Proposing suggestions for peaceful resolution of disputes; 3. Recommending actions to the Security Council.

### US Will Propose New Proposal on Balkans Issue

[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] It is known today that the US delegation has drafted a new proposal on the Balkans issue, requesting UN agencies to immediately establish a "large-scale" group to regularly monitor the borders of Greece with Southern Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania, in order to reduce conflicts in the region, protect Greece from communist intrusion, and consolidate Truman Doctrine's international position. The case will be discussed by the 55-nation Political Committee. Mrs. Roosevelt has been ordered to assist the US representative to counter future strong opposition from the Soviet Union.

### Australian Foreign Minister Elected Chairman of Palestine Special Committee

[Report from this Newspaper] The United Nations Special Committee on Palestine, broadcasting from San Francisco on the 25th, elected Australian Foreign Minister Evatt to serve as Chairman of the Committee today. It is scheduled to discuss the investigation committee's report tomorrow, with the British representative making a statement.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 25th] Britain plans to state to the Palestine Committee that if UN agencies can find a solution to the Palestine problem, Britain is prepared to provide appropriate support.

### United Nations Budget Reduced to $34 Million

[United Nations Office in Shanghai, Lake Success, 24th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie will submit a budget of $34.5 million for 1948 to the Fifth (Administrative and Budgetary) Committee of the General Assembly today, a reduction of $5 million from the amount estimated by the Advisory Committee this summer.

### Italian Left-Wing Parties Launch Anti-Government Movement - Labor Disputes Continue to Expand

[United Press International, Rome, 24th] Italian left-wing parties on the 24th again called for the formation of a new Italian government that includes the Communist Party, and suggested that the parliament's scheduled debate and vote of confidence on Christian Democratic Prime Minister Gasperi's cabinet be postponed again. As the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party continue to confer, in order to form a united anti-government group, they are making continuous efforts to force a showdown in parliament, and labor disputes continue to expand.

The Communist Party said that the parliamentary debate may not begin before next Tuesday. Although the government suffered a defeat on the 23rd evening regarding the amendment of the law, it seems difficult for the extreme left to create a united party against Gasperi and gain support. The Republican Party, which initially claimed to be willing to join hands with the Communist Party, said that they will act alone when casting their vote of confidence. The right-wing Socialist Party, led by Saragat, will also not participate, leaving the Communist Party supported only by the left-wing Socialist Party led by Lunni and a small number of Action Party members.

### Judges of the Far East Military Tribunal Debate - Chief Prosecutor Exonerates the Emperor - Emphasizes that the Emperor Did Not Launch the War

[United Press International, Tokyo, 25th] The Far East Military Tribunal continued to hear Japanese war criminals today. Chief Prosecutor Keenan issued a statement exonerating Emperor Hirohito from any suspicion of war crimes. Previously, war criminal Okada was cross-examined in court. Keenan asked: "Is it true that the Emperor did not want to launch a war against the United States on the eve of the Pearl Harbor incident and wanted to avoid it?" Okada replied: "Indeed. The Emperor was not concerned about the outcome of the war. He really hated war."

Judge Webb interrupted and said: "I think this matter is irrelevant to the case." Keenan disagreed, saying: "The defendants usurped Japanese power and deceived the people, believing that the edict issued a few hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor was due to the Emperor's approval of the war. This is obviously relevant." Webb replied: "This kind of statement is the first time we have seen it after many days of trial and violates the prosecutor's evidence." Keenan, his face flushed, apparently as angry as Webb, spoke again: "As Chief Prosecutor, I ask the court to note that the defendants are all present. We believe that these people are responsible for this war. If there are other responsible parties, they must also be included among the defendants."

### Heated Debate at the Municipal Council Session: Labor Service Corps Proposal Postponed, Support for Borrowing US Deposits Approved

[Report from Our Newspaper] The first half of the fourth session of the Municipal Council, involving inquiries to various bureaus, has concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the fourth session commenced, during which six proposals submitted by the Speaker were discussed, along with the adoption of three recommendations regarding the issuance of permits for goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, and two recommendations regarding the request for the return of occupied properties. Yesterday, when the session discussed the proposal submitted by the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Works to organize a National Obligatory Labor Service Corps, it sparked a heated debate among the councilors, with divided opinions on whether to implement or postpone it. According to Councilor Tao Baichuan, the draft constitution included a clause stating that "citizens have the obligation to perform public service," but this was opposed by many, who argued that since citizens already have the obligation to perform military service, it was inappropriate to impose another obligation for public service. Furthermore, the provision for public service was issued during wartime, and has since been removed. Therefore, he advocated for the temporary postponement of the proposal. Councilor Qu Yue vehemently opposed this, insisting on its adoption. He argued that dredging river channels in the suburbs was underway, and without a labor service corps, the project would be abandoned halfway, greatly affecting the people in the suburbs. Ultimately, a vote was held, resulting in 68 votes in favor of postponement and 31 votes against.

Additionally, the Council resolved to postpone the proposal from the Municipal Government for reviewing the "Implementation Measures for Relocating Tricycles to the Suburbs in Response to the Request from Unemployed Workers from Northern Jiangsu to Issue Tricycle Licenses in the Suburbs." However, it was decided that the third session's resolution to issue 1,170 tricycle licenses to refugees from Northern Jiangsu, limited to operating in the suburbs, would still be implemented.

Regarding the amendment made by the third session to the Military Service Law's exemption clause, which originally stated "those responsible for the livelihood of one or more direct relatives," and was amended to "those responsible for the livelihood of one or more family members," the Municipal Government believed the amended scope was too broad and requested reconsideration to retain the original clause. Yesterday, the Council session, after discussing the matter, adopted Tao Baichuan's suggestion to request clarification from the central government regarding the term "sole responsibility for family livelihood." Until clarification is received, the amended clause from the Council will be followed.

The session unanimously approved the proposal from the Provisional Council of Liaoning Province to "borrow deposits from Chinese citizens in the United States to rescue the economic crisis and suppress rebellion and save the nation," as well as three points regarding opinions submitted by the Tianjin District Industrial Association and other organizations to the government, advocating for the opening of trade with Japan.

### Recommendations Regarding Goods Imported with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

Regarding the petition from export trade associations for the issuance of permits for goods imported with self-provided foreign exchange, Councilor Bao Wenxin reported on the process of receiving the petition. The session approved the following three recommendations:

For production equipment, industrial raw materials, and other essential goods for people's livelihoods that have already completed registration procedures and comply with trade regulations, it is requested that they be released as soon as possible to facilitate production and construction.

Regarding the registration deadline, the Import Control Commission originally stipulated that goods must arrive in Shanghai and be shipped by August 16th, but the announcement was only published on August 21st, leaving insufficient time. Considering the circumstances, it is requested that registration be permitted retroactively for all goods shipped before the end of September.

As for government procurement, it is absolutely unfeasible. It is requested that the government weigh the advantages and disadvantages and give it serious consideration.

The session also passed two recommendations regarding the petitions from groups requesting the return of occupied properties: The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is recommended to immediately revoke the Shanghai Economic Farm's plan to take over and occupy civilian land and promptly return it to the owners. It is recommended that the Executive Yuan adopt and implement the draft organizational rules for the Executive Yuan's Shanghai Municipal Central Government Agency Review Committee for the Use of Enemy and Puppet Occupied Civilian Properties.

### Order to Refund Overcharged Tuition Fees: Most of the 70,000 Children Out of School Due to Parental Refusal

[Report from Our Newspaper] Acting Director of the Bureau of Education Li Ximou and Director of the Bureau of Health Zhang Wei yesterday organized responses at the session to inquiries raised by councilors from the previous day regarding the two bureaus.

According to Director Li's response: Regarding Councilor Pang Jingzhou's accusation that private schools were inventing pretexts to solicit parents' opinions on budget statements, a thorough investigation will be conducted to stop this practice. The salaries of new teachers added to municipal schools in August have been approved by the Municipal Government and will be paid in September. The overcharge of tuition fees by municipal middle schools in the suburbs is a fact. The principals of Yangjing, Yangsi, and two other schools have been summoned for discussions, and they have been ordered to refund the overcharged fees separately. Half of the academic advancement fees will be refunded by middle schools, and elementary schools that have not yet refunded them will be ordered to do so. Those who cannot afford to pay the academic advancement fees are not required to pay, and repeated orders have been issued prohibiting forced collection. According to statistics on school-age children, there are approximately 420,000 to 430,000, with over 360,000 enrolled and about 70,000 out of school. According to the Bureau's investigation, many children are out of school because their parents refuse to allow them to attend, due to illness, disability, or work. The Bureau operates some night schools and community schools, but due to financial difficulties, they can only utilize the spare time and facilities of other schools to provide education, allowing workers to study while working. The biggest obstacle to the widespread establishment of national schools is the lack of school buildings.

### Use of Teacher Appreciation Donations

The nature of normal schools is to train teachers for junior high schools and national schools. Regarding the destruction of Wuben Girls' Middle School buildings by the Municipal Normal School, an investigation was conducted in person, and it was found that the Normal School did not damage the water and electricity, but only took away blackboards and cupboards, which will be ordered to be returned. Regarding the inflated enrollment figures at the Normal School, an investigation revealed that it was due to a large number of students registering at the beginning of the semester, with some students later dropping out or not attending classes. Last year's teacher appreciation donations of 100 million yuan will be used for secondary education and social welfare projects.

### Negotiations to Cancel Lease for Establishing School in Vegetable Market

[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Zhang of the Bureau of Health replied to inquiries, stating: Regarding the Municipal Sixth Hospital on Daxi Road, the second and third floors were used as staff dormitories due to a shortage of housing, resulting in some non-bureau employees residing there. The third floor has now been completely vacated, and there are still five families on the second floor, who must move out by the end of the month, otherwise the police station will be notified to enforce the eviction. Regarding the establishment of general stores and schools in the vegetable market, the truth is that the third floor of the Triangle Land Vegetable Market was originally vacant. In May of last year, Sanfu Company negotiated with the Bureau of Finance, and after approval by the Finance Committee, leased the floor to open a hygienic cafeteria. Later, upon hearing that there were schools being run there, the Bureau requested the Bureau of Education to investigate whether they were registered, and negotiated with the original tenant company to cancel the lease. A small number of employees reside in the vegetable market management office, and will be ordered to move out as soon as the Bureau has dormitories available. The corpses at the Tongren Fuyuan Hall need to be buried urgently and are temporarily piled up in the open space by the roadside, and burial has been ordered. The pollution of the Suzhou Creek is a dredging issue, and discussions have been held with the Bureau of Public Works.

### Council Retracts Proposal to Abolish Voluntary Inspectors

### Lawsuit Involving Real and Fake Wives of Classmate: Accusation of Impersonating Diplomatic Envoy's Family Member to Illegally Obtain Travel Expenses in US Dollars

[Report from Our Newspaper] Gao Qinqiu, a female clerk in the Statistics Office of the Police Department, was sued yesterday by a young woman, Li Rongni, in the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Gao of impersonating a family member of a diplomatic envoy stationed abroad to illegally obtain over 1,000 US dollars in travel expenses. Xie Jiashu, a graduate of the Diplomacy Department of the Central Political School who later worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was introduced to Li Rongni (Yunyi), a student at the Fudan University Statistics Training Program, in 1945 by a friend. They became involved without going through engagement procedures and had a daughter. Later, Xie became romantically involved with Gao Qinqiu (also a student at the Fudan Training Program), a clerk in the Statistics Office of the same department, and gradually became indifferent to Li. In March of last year, Xie was assigned to the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco, USA. Before leaving the country, he sent a letter to Li Rongni, guaranteeing that he would never get engaged or married to anyone else. However, after going abroad, he disappeared without a trace. Although Li remained infatuated and often sent letters asking about him, Xie ignored them all. Later, due to financial difficulties in Shanghai, Li received 300,000 to 400,000 yuan per month from He Xingren, a section chief in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, who was a classmate of Xie's. Li reported this situation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and requested assistance, and the Ministry promised to investigate thoroughly. Gao Qinqiu, Xie's later lover, left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and came to Shanghai to work as a clerk in the Statistics Office of the Police Department. Recently, she forged a marriage certificate with Xie and applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to illegally obtain over 1,000 US dollars in travel expenses as a family member of a diplomatic envoy stationed abroad, intending to go abroad to San Francisco to meet Xie. Upon hearing this, Li Rongni became extremely anxious. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she also filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, claiming that Gao is a married woman, her husband is Xu Liangyi, director of the Nanshi branch of the Shanghai Municipal Bank, and they have not divorced. Her marriage certificate is purely forged. She requested a thorough investigation of the illegal obtaining of over 1,000 US dollars in travel expenses as a family member of a diplomatic envoy stationed abroad. After receiving the above complaint, the District Prosecutor's Office will schedule a hearing to question both Li and Gao.

### Those Coerced into Wrongdoing Should Awaken Early and Register: Social Affairs Bureau Orders All Guilds to Diligently Promote

[Central News Agency] The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the quality of workers in the city is uneven. Recently, the city cracked down on a case involving treacherous bandits, including Wu Kewen, a worker at the Shanghai Electric Power Company. In other places, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no bandits lurking among them, engaging in agitation. At this time, the government issued measures for the disposal of the Communist Party in the rear, and the Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters stipulated that from September 25th to September 28th, 2023, the deadline for registration, the various labor unions have been ordered to take this opportunity to be lenient and allow self-renewal. Those who have been coerced into wrongdoing or have blindly followed others should awaken early and promptly comply with the deadline, in accordance with the prescribed procedures, to apply for registration and extricate themselves. If they remain unrepentant and fail to apply for registration before the deadline, they will have only themselves to blame if they are arrested by the military and police agencies. The various labor unions must not use this as an excuse to protect them. The Social Affairs Bureau has specially ordered the various labor unions to diligently promote these disposal measures and jointly seek purification.

### Defected Communist Soldiers Arrive in Shanghai, Discuss "Eighth Route Army" Secrets, Extremely Poor Supplies, Harassing Civilians Everywhere, Strict Surveillance of Intellectuals

[Our Report] 3,161 officers and soldiers of a certain infantry regiment directly under the Ministry of National Defense arrived in Shanghai aboard the China Merchants Bureau's Hai Zhou Wheel, docking at the Qiujiang Wharf. Yesterday morning, our reporter visited and learned from Regiment Commander Shen Dedi that most of the comrades in this regiment had defected from the Communist army, with 60% voluntarily surrendering, 30% being prisoners of war, and many others being former National Army soldiers who had been captured by the Communists and returned. He also said, "The quality of the Communist soldiers who surrendered is very good, with a very high level of education, including high school and university students, and a literacy rate of 95%. Most are from Shandong, Shanxi, and the Northeast." The reporter interviewed two "Old Eighth Route Army" soldiers, one named Zhang Yongde from Beijing and the other named Gao Shangjun from Liaodong. According to them, joining the "Eighth Route Army" was a baffling matter, as they only knew it as a "Security Force" when they joined. Soldiers in the "Eighth Route Army" are called "Warriors," and the "Warriors" have extremely poor supplies, eating and wearing the people's belongings everywhere. Currently, when the people of the Northeast see the "Eighth Route Army" coming, they hide all the food and clothing they can. Cadres at the company level and above receive better treatment, with a salary of 50 yuan per month regardless of rank), paid in "Liaodong Military Region Military Vouchers," with 50 yuan equivalent to 100 yuan of Northeast circulating currency, but the people regard it as waste paper and cannot circulate it at all. Life in the army is quite free, with three Communist Party members in each platoon. There are many Korean Communists, and many "Big Noses" (referring to Russians). Currently, the Communist Party does not want intellectuals to join the party and monitors intellectuals more closely. In the Battle of Siping, the Communist bandits used non-Party members as the vanguard, giving each person four hand grenades to charge, while Communist Party members with heavy weapons stayed behind, so non-Party members suffered heavy casualties.

### "Takeover" Officials Mo Yushuo and Li Jiewen Executed by Firing Squad in Guangzhou, Before and After

[Our Report from Guangzhou on the 20th via airmail] On the afternoon of the 16th, a military vehicle drove out of the gate of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Military Law Office, packed with military police, escorting two convicted officials to the execution ground in the northern suburbs. The people on the road thought they were executing Japanese war criminals, but later they realized that these two convicted officials were the once-prominent takeover officials who had been detained and interrogated for years due to "takeover" and corruption, and were recently sentenced to death and executed on the spot by the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters: one was Mo Yushuo, the former Lieutenant General Special Commissioner of the Guangzhou District Special Commissioner Office of the Ministry of Military Administration, and the other was Li Jiewen, the Major General Commander of the Guangdong Provincial Sand Protection Corps.

Swatting Flies is Common, But Catching Tigers is Rare

As soon as this news spread, people were very happy, because swatting flies is common, but catching tigers is rare. At least in Guangzhou, executing corrupt high-ranking officials with the rank of Lieutenant General and Major General is a first.

Mo Yushuo was from Yangjiang, Guangdong, and was 44 years old. Li Jiewen was from Dongguan, Guangdong, and was 43 years old. Both were early graduates of Whampoa Military Academy. Mo once served as an army commander, and Li once served as the commander of the Guangzhou Social Training Corps and the chief officer of the training camp for students above the secondary level, but they both failed the country's cultivation. Despite holding high positions, they were still corrupt and violated the law, which is regrettable.

Clearing Up the Muddled Account of the Seized Goods

When Mo was first sent back to Guangzhou, he was considered one of the most powerful takeover officials. Li Jiewen served as a Major General Director in his office. At that time, the Enemy and Puppet Property Management Office had not yet been established, so the military special office not only took over military supplies, but also all kinds of Western-style houses, cars, etc., and many things were not transferred with a record. At that time, the general public had long complained about the office's takeover malpractices. In September of last year, the Guangdong-Guangxi District Takeover Investigation Team came to Guangdong, and this muddled account of the takeover was cleared up, and Mo and Li were taken into custody and sent to the central government for interrogation. Mo was sent back to the city on September 23rd, and Li was escorted back to Guangzhou on October 26th.

Higher Military Law Court Investigation Reveals Military Equipment Being Embezzled

"The charges for which they were sentenced to death this time are: jointly embezzling the seized military firearms and transporting them to Huangge, Hengdang, and Sanjiao townships in Zhongshan County for concealment, including more than 100 light and heavy machine guns, 16 mortars, 2,000 rifles, and another 700 boxes of spare parts and ammunition. In addition, Mo colluded with his staff to replace more than 200 inner tubes of the seized vehicles with waste products to profit." This case was investigated by Peng Weiren, the Lieutenant General Director sent by the Ministry of National Defense, who organized the Higher Military Law Court to conduct the trial. The facts were confirmed, and the sentence was passed according to law.

Mo Yushuo Wrote a Will Complaining About Family Financial Difficulties

When the judge asked Mo Yushuo and Li Jiewen in the military court if they had any last words, Li said angrily, "No, no, nothing." Mo picked up a pen and wrote a will to his wife, which read: "Dear Sister Zhen: Regarding the outcome of this trial, soldiers obey orders, and there is nothing to say. I ask my sister to take care of the family affairs. I think you will handle it well, so I have no worries. If there are financial difficulties in the future, please ask friends for help. I think Yu Chen and Brother Xinzhong, Military Commander Hu Boyu, and Commander-in-Chief Huo Songshan, etc., can help. Yushuo, 9/16." After the will was written, the two were escorted to the Liuhua Bridge execution ground. According to custom, they were offered wine and meat before the execution, but both declined. At 5:30, four gunshots were heard in quick succession, and these two "takeover" officials ended their lives under the judgment of national law, leaving a lesson for those who are corrupt! (Special Correspondent Liang Feng)

### Mo and Li Were Shocked and Terrified When They Heard the Verdict. Mo Yushuo Asked, "Who Approved This?" and Scolded Li Jiewen, "What's All the Noise?"

[Our Report from Guangzhou via airmail] During the trial of Mo Yushuo and Li Jiewen's corruption case, a rumor circulated that the initial verdict of the court-martial was only a ten-year prison sentence, but when the verdict was submitted to Chairman Chiang, he immediately changed it to a death sentence. If this rumor is true, we can see Chairman Chiang's determination to severely punish corruption.

Chairman Chiang's order was issued on September 12th, and brought by a commissioner on a special plane on the afternoon of the 15th. On the afternoon of the 16th, at 5 PM, Zheng Zongyuan, the deputy director of the military law office, presided over the trial and read out Chairman Chiang's order. Mo and Li were shocked and terrified. Li even argued vehemently and asked, "Who approved this?" Mo pretended to be calm and turned to scold Li, "Soldiers only obey orders, what's all the noise?" Li then became silent and stopped talking.

### Four Major Crises in Fujian Education, Talked About by Liang Longguang, Director of the Fujian Education Department

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 24th] According to Liang Longguang, the new Director of the Fujian Education Department, the current education in Fujian contains four major crises: 　lack of funds, 　teacher imbalance, 　poor academic atmosphere, and 　low student quality. He said, "This year's education funding in Fujian Province is only 2.2 billion yuan, of which the cost of meals for publicly funded students accounts for 1.5 billion yuan, leaving only 700 million yuan for school equipment and basic school treatment needs, which is clearly insufficient. In terms of teachers, talents are concentrated in cities, forming a surplus of talents in cities, resulting in unemployment, while inland areas feel a lack of them. General schools, due to insufficient funds, simple equipment, and low teacher quality, have no way to improve the academic atmosphere. The level of students is also not easy to improve. There are currently more than one million children out of school and more than four million adults out of school in the province. The funding for national education is particularly scarce, with the highest counties accounting for only 5% of total expenditures and the lowest accounting for only 1.5%. Secondary education currently has 20 provincial middle schools, 10 vocational schools, 13 normal schools, and 50 county middle schools. The middle schools in remote counties are mostly of too low a standard and cannot find teachers for English, mathematics, and physics. I especially call on private educators to run more primary schools to strengthen the implementation of national education."

### Public Tennis; Semi-Finals Conclude; Wang Wenzheng and Tao Guanqiu Win Doubles Against Zhou and Tang

The semi-finals of various groups in the Second Shanghai Open Tennis Tournament all concluded as scheduled yesterday. The finals are scheduled to begin tomorrow. In the past three days, male and female players from various groups have been competing for the right to advance to the finals, filling the entire Shanghai tennis community with an atmosphere of tension and excitement. Except for two mixed doubles matches and one women's singles match held at the Sports Federation, the results of which are unknown, the results of other matches are as follows:

In the intermediate singles, although Su Mingren lost to Sun Yifang by a score of 1 to 2, Mr. Su's skills were highly appreciated by connoisseurs. His serves and interceptions are excellent, and his overhead jumps are rare. He is currently twenty-one years old and studied at Zhengshi Middle School.

### Opening of Textile Production Conference; Minister of Economic Affairs Personally Comes to Shanghai to Preside and Instructs on Six Key Points for Development Policy

[Our Dispatch] The National Textile Industry Production Conference opened at the City Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, with over 200 representatives in attendance. It was chaired by Chen Qitian, Minister of Economic Affairs. Mr. Chen stated in his address: "In the current environment of our country, the textile industry is the most promising industry for development. Therefore, industrial construction must take the development of the textile industry as its central policy. To seek the development of the textile industry, the following points should be noted in policy: Prevention of the development of the Japanese textile industry; State-run and private-run factories should cooperate rather than compete; The development of the textile industry should closely cooperate with agriculture, animal husbandry, sericulture, and trade departments; The basis of textile construction is to improve textile technology; The Textile Adjustment Committee will actively promote guidance work based on the recently adopted plan by the Executive Yuan to develop the textile industry and adjust the supply and demand of yarn and cloth; Pay attention to the export of textile finished products, etc."

Following this, a representative of the National Economic Council, concurrently Chairman Qiang, delivered a training speech, and guests Du Yuesheng, Shu Yunzhang, Chu Fucheng, Shi Fengxiang, and others successively delivered speeches. The meeting adjourned around 12:00 noon.

The conference continued in the afternoon at 3:00 p.m., still chaired by Chen Qitian. Secretary-General Liu Wenteng reported: 270 notification letters were issued, 215 representatives registered, and 170 were in attendance. Three congratulatory telegrams were received from the Shanghai Municipality. Representatives can freely determine their participation in group discussions, and each group should elect five conveners. 101 proposals were received, 14 for the raw materials group, 18 for the technology group, 6 for the capital group, 11 for the education and research group, 30 for the transportation and sales group, and 21 for other groups merged into the general affairs group. Immediately afterwards, the entire body passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang. Representatives from relevant agencies then began to report, including: Sun Yushu, Director of the Cotton Production Improvement Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Diao Minren, Deputy Secretary-General of the Four Joint Offices, Xu Zukang, representative of the Animal Husbandry Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Deng Fajin, representative of the Export Control Committee, representative of the Ministry of National Defense, Liu Siying, Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and Liu Jingji, representative of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, who gave detailed reports.

Liu Siying, Pan Xulun, Shu Yunzhang, and others were invited to speak. Liu Siying hoped that yarn and cloth prices would not skyrocket to avoid affecting exports. Shu Yunzhang believed that the only way to overcome the current difficulties was to increase production. Pan Xulun spoke in his personal capacity and was extremely frank, saying that before the overall situation is clarified, all one can do is try one's best. The event ended happily at 9:00 p.m.

### Affected by Tight Credit, Hua Shares Rise Slightly

Although Hua shares rose yesterday, they were very uncertain. The swap premium rose due to tight credit. Although buying interest was strong, it was very volatile. Although Yongsha created a high price, it could not last. In the afternoon, credit became even tighter, and state bank exchangers entered heavily. A large number of bulls emerged, and market prices gradually felt unsustainable in the uncertainty.

Morning Opening

Prices were high at the opening, but after the opening, the transaction became clear and slightly fatigued. There were many entries from all sides, and from the immediate delivery price of 264 yuan and the deferred delivery price of 271 yuan, the price rose to 268 yuan and 279 yuan, and interest rates rose. The bulls were not without concerns. After the sale, they became timid again. The outside interest rate opened high to 25 cents and 30 cents. After 10:30 a.m., it was forced down to the immediate delivery price of 259 yuan and the deferred delivery low price of 271 yuan. After the interest rate was agreed, the buying momentum immediately revived. Now Yongsha rose to an immediate delivery price of 274 yuan and a deferred delivery price of 285 yuan. Taking advantage of the high price, there was a settlement, and spot Yongsha was sold, once falling to 278 yuan. The bulls added more chips at will, and near noon, they pulled the deferred Yongsha up to 284 yuan again. Overnight, there was a lot of floating, and due to time constraints, there was a lot of supply. The midday closing price for immediate delivery was 265 yuan, and the deferred delivery price was 280 yuan. The difference between spot and deferred was as much as 15 yuan. Therefore, after the midday closing, the deferred Yongsha was called down to around 275 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous closing price of immediate delivery shares, Yongsha, Meyer, China France, Zhabei, Zhongxing, New Asia, Shangping, Huafeng, Qinxing, Xinhua, Rongfeng, China Textile, China Silk, Commercial Press, Matches, and Lian rose slightly. Huaxin fell by half a percent, Hengfeng fell slightly, Jinglun Cement rose by half a percent, and underwear rose by one percent. Deferred delivery shares Huafeng rose by one percent, Xinhe Meyer rose by half a percent, and Yongsha rose slightly.

Afternoon

I heard that the black market price was also smart. The market saw show and many consecutive investments were made to exit. Those who entered also desperately sold, and the deferred Yongsha gradually decreased to 269 yuan. It was reported that a large number of officials came to Shanghai to check accounts, and there were new measures for self-provided foreign exchange. The selling intention was already in place. The national bank also entered 9.29 billion, forcing the immediate delivery price down to 257 yuan and the deferred delivery price to 266 yuan. Finally, it hovered around 260 yuan and 270 yuan. The asking price after closing was uncertain. As a result, compared with the morning closing price of immediate delivery shares, Yongsha, Xinhe, Meyer, Huafeng, China France, Xinhua, Zhabei, Rongfeng, China Silk, Jinglun, and Lian fell slightly, Qinxing, Matches, and Hengfeng were flat, China Textile fell by half a percent, towel and Huaxin rose slightly. Deferred delivery shares Yongsha, Xinhe, Meyer, and Huafeng all reported small declines. Outside the market, old shares Yuyu and Hengfeng were stable.

The capital increase of Tongyi Yarn Factory has been completed and trading is scheduled to resume today. The trading unit is set at 50,000 shares.

Current Situation

Profiteering. Yesterday, the interest rate was high, about 13 to 20 cents, because the bank's funding was limited and the bulls were crowded. The premium for Yongsha was from 8.5 yuan to 12 yuan, and ended at 11 yuan. Xinhe was from 5 yuan to 6.5 yuan, and Meyer was from 18 yuan to 20 yuan. Many bulls had pre-booked with the bank, so trading in the market was not brisk. Numbers 223, 24, 116 posted the most.

### Reduction of Security Deposit is All Rumor

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 5th] According to the Ministry of Finance: Recently, there has been talk in the Shanghai stock market that the security deposit has been changed to 30%. The person in charge of the Ministry of Finance said that this rumor is purely a rumor. The Ministry has telegraphed the resident supervisor to investigate the rumor-monger and prosecute him according to law.

### Unified Bonds Rise, Foreign Shares Firm

For public bonds, Unified Unit C was still flat yesterday, and the remaining bonds trended upward. Rooms 503 and 538 sold, and Rooms 552, 614 and 555 all entered. The transaction volume increased to 7 million. Unified Unit C opened at 12,600 yuan in the morning and rose from 12,400 yuan to 13,400 yuan before turning to consolidation. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Units A and B rose by 700 yuan, Unified Unit C rose by 400 yuan, and Unified Unit D also rose by a good 600 yuan.

Foreign shares were still firm yesterday and were even smarter in the afternoon, because the Hong Kong-Shanghai Telegram narrowed to within 10 yuan, and buyers were eager. Yisha opened at 112,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 26,000 yuan at the end of the afternoon. Although Jewish merchant securities firms supplied, Guangbang and foreign firms all entered. As a result, compared with the previous closing, Yisha and Kenzhi each rose by about 10%, and Yisha Beer, Steel, and Shipping each rose by about 5%. The remaining shares rose slightly.

### Foreign Exchange and Trade Measures Remain Unchanged; Deputy Governor of the National Bank Responsible for Statement

[Our Dispatch] Deputy Governor Liu of the Central Bank issued the following statement yesterday:

Recent reports in various newspapers about foreign exchange and trade measures are mostly inconsistent with the facts. According to the business report from the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee yesterday to September 17, foreign exchange income reached approximately US$20 million in the first month after the committee was established, which is a very good situation. Although a part of it was converted from export goods accumulated before the announcement of the new foreign exchange measures, the timing is right for the peak export season, and the export prospects are quite optimistic.

As for the foreign exchange required for imports, whether official or market price, the government will continue to provide it fully as usual. Since the implementation of the import quota system, it has gradually entered a normal state, and there is no reason to change the measures.

Regarding the price of gold, the Central Bank converts it according to the market price of US$40 per tael, as approved by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. There is also no change in this measure. Various rumors outside are unfounded.

### Yarn and Cloth Firm

In yesterday's yarn market, the appetite of all parties at the initial opening was still healthy, and the sentiment was quite good. The market rose again. However, as credit tightened, the market fell back. Near the close, due to the small number of factory openings, prices returned to firm. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn created a new high of 27.7 million yuan, up 1.8 million yuan from the previous day. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 700,000 to 1 million yuan across the board.

In yesterday's cotton cloth market, many sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell at the morning opening, and the market once declined. However, around 10:30 a.m., it was reported that the Textile Construction Company was also selling low-end fine cloth, and Yuan Biji was not opened, which caused the buying sentiment to recover and the asking price to turn from soft to firm. Around 11:45 a.m., yarn prices rose again, and market prices rose step by step. Finally, the prices of various fine cloths rose again by 7,000 to 20,000 yuan across the board. The prices of other bleached cloths, Biji, and Shilin cloths also continued to rise by 5,000 to 30,000 to 40,000 yuan across the board.

Textile Construction Sells Cloth

[Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 56,300 pieces, with a total of 1,427 purchase orders. Internal manufacturers submitted 39 orders, purchasing 5,280 pieces of cloth. The cloth number was 1,388, and 51,020 pieces of cloth were purchased　.

Spot Cotton Prices Rise

Yesterday's spot cotton market was first flat and then firm. Yarn factories watched as the price of flowers rose to a peak for several consecutive days and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Due to tight credit, the industry turned from entering to exiting. The trend in the middle was once slightly fatigued. Later, as the closing price of cotton yarn rose again, the sentiment was stable, and the shorts covered their positions, and trading resumed. As a result, prices mostly rose, and the total transaction volume for the day was about 2,000 bales.

Recently, coal prices have soared, supplies are scarce, and purchasing is difficult, affecting oil refining.

Additionally, there are six dyeing factories requiring 48 tons of bituminous coal. In the past, they purchased from the black market to meet their needs. Currently, due to soaring coal prices and scarce supplies, they request approval for coal allocation to reduce costs and maintain business operations. Resolution: Allocate from civil use coal.

Each association receiving allocation this time should collect coal within the time limit stipulated in the warehouse receipt. If there are overdue circumstances, extend the period according to the warehouse receipt extension method, paying a storage fee of 1,000 yuan per ton. Do not request free extension.

### History of Chinese Art

— Written by Wen Zhaotong and Hu Man

Published by Qunyi Publishing House

There are not many published works on the history of Chinese art in the country. There are only the following:

A Short History of Chinese Art: Written by Teng Gu: Commercial Press

History of Chinese Art: Written by Zheng Chang: Zhonghua

Introduction to the History of Chinese Art: Edited by Li Puyuan; Liangyou

The Evolution of Chinese Art; Written by Wang Junchu: Wenxin

A History of the Development of Chinese Art: Written by Liu Sixun: Commercial Press

Among them, except for the two books by Li and Wang, which are written with scientific historical perspectives after careful consideration, most of the others are written using the method of chronological division. The two books by Zheng and Liu use painting, calligraphy, architecture, sculpture, and crafts as the warp and use chronological narratives. Although we cannot completely and definitively say which path the method of historical writing should take, at least, in recent years, in the vigorous atmosphere of new historical research in China, writing according to a historical perspective that is closer to science may be easier to arouse interest. The Hu's "History of Chinese Art" that I am going to introduce now was written under this premise.

This book is divided into twelve chapters, which are generally similar to Wang's book, but more substantial, and there are also novel discoveries in terms of historical materials and textual research. For example:

Regarding the origin of the "Six Principles of Painting," according to the research of Japanese scholar Kinbara Shogo, Xie He's theory was deeply influenced by Gu Kaizhi. This statement has almost become a conclusion in the field of Chinese painting theory. However, in this book, it is said: "Chinese painting at that time was influenced by Western art. From the Han Dynasty, Persian merchant ships traveled to Guangzhou for trade, which became even more prosperous in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. The Indian monk Faxian took a Persian merchant ship. At that time, oil painting methods were brought from Persia... Although this oil painting method was not fully applied to painting by Chinese painters in the Jin Dynasty, it obviously existed in Jin Dynasty painting, especially in the portraits of emperors of the Six Dynasties, with techniques of sketching from life, such as chiaroscuro, which is the source of the Chinese 'concave-convex method.' This sketching method is one of the basic conditions for the formation of the 'Six Principles.' In addition, it was also considerably influenced by the general art of Greece and Mesopotamia. The Greek-style stone pillars and Assyrian-style winged stone beast carvings in the tombs of the Six Dynasties are clear evidence. Moreover, 'Sadanage' in Indian Buddhist painting: Recognition of phenomena, correct feeling, scale and structure, emotional movement in form, the expression of Athenian art, hieroglyphics, the use of colors and shades. Although these six points are not entirely the same as the meaning of the 'Six Principles,' Indian Buddhist paintings have long been introduced to China, and it is possible that their painting methods came with them. Since these Western arts gradually spread to China and gave new stimulation to Chinese art, in the Six Dynasties, the 'Six Principles' were produced. It is a new painting method that comprehensively integrates Western methods and all previous Chinese methods. This is the true source of the outline of the 'Six Principles,' and it is not like Xie He himself deliberately mystifying it, and therefore he did not give the 'Six Principles' a corresponding development." (Pages 60-61).

Regarding the issue of the Northern and Southern Schools of landscape painting, this is a division since Dong Qichang. Bei Shi once said: "The family has the Northern and Southern Schools, which began to be divided in the Tang Dynasty. The Northern and Southern Schools of Zen are also divided in the Tang Dynasty." (Notes from the Painting Room). The author believes that this is a historical truncation. The book writes:

"In the Northern and Southern Dynasties, two great painters in the Southern Liang Dynasty pioneered the independent development of landscape painting. At the same time, they also became the ancestors of the Northern and Southern Schools. One was Zhang Sengyou, who used heavy blue and green colors on silk to paint mountains, springs, rocks, hills, and jagged cliffs, and then added colors. This is the 'blue-and-green landscape' school. Even within a short distance, one can feel ten thousand miles away." These two great painters, one was Zheng Fashi (from Hebei), who learned from Zhang Sengyou. His pavilion paintings received such comments: "He is committed to carving through stones, and paints trees with many made-up patterns." Undoubtedly.

"Therefore, I believe that the division of the Northern and Southern Schools of landscape painting originated from Zhang Sengyou and Xiao Yi in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and passed through Zheng Fashi and Zhan Ziqian to become the two major schools of the North and South. In the Tang Dynasty, the so-called 'Southern School' and 'Northern School' appeared, which meant the style of following the Southern or Northern Schools." (Pages 57-58).

We believe that this type of discovery is a unique insight. Originally, the author's purpose in writing this book was also unique. In the "Preface," it says:

"The creation of art and the theory of art are inextricably linked. If we want to obtain the correct direction of art activities and the methods of art creation, we must study the origins, changes, and laws of the occurrence and development of our national art. That is to say, we must critically accept the heritage of history. Therefore, based on archaeological excavations, actually existing art materials, historical and unofficial records about art, and various technical books, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive research and scientific analysis. At the same time, we must break the misunderstandings and distortions of Chinese art by vulgar scholars, and break those prejudices that have arisen under feudalism and capitalism, and that have been poisoned by their 'education.'"

From this book, we can eliminate the following prejudices: The prejudice that Chinese art is isolated, the prejudice that Chinese art should be completely Westernized, and the prejudice that Chinese and Western art should be reconciled. If art workers can stand on the position of the people, these prejudices will naturally disappear, and the true image of the history of Chinese art will naturally be seen very clearly.

### "Today's Outer Mongolia" Written by Pan Gongzhao Published by China Science Company

Recently, the issue of Outer Mongolia has attracted much attention both domestically and internationally, but Chinese people have very little accurate understanding of the truth about Outer Mongolia. The books about Outer Mongolia published by the publishing industry are old stories from before the war, fragmented and incomplete, and those who want to see the whole picture of Outer Mongolia often sigh. The publication of Mr. Pan Gongzhao's book "Today's Outer Mongolia" (People's Republic of Mongolia) can be called the first Chinese document studying the current situation of Outer Mongolia.

The whole book is divided into nine parts and twenty-four chapters, which introduce in detail the geography, history, ethnic distribution, living conditions, customs and habits, national economy, finance and finance, animal husbandry, agriculture, industry, mining, resources, commerce and foreign trade, revolutionary process, political construction, political party organization, military strength, social and cultural status of Outer Mongolia. It also has more detailed explanations of the relationship between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, the leading figures of Mongolia, and the research institutions of the Soviet Union on Mongolia. The beginning of the book also has a preface by Lei Fazhang, the former Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs who was specially appointed by the Central Government to supervise the Outer Mongolia independence vote. There is also a preface by Maisky, an expert on Soviet Mongolian issues. The end of the book also has the full text of the current constitution of Outer Mongolia. In addition, the national flag of Outer Mongolia, landscape photos, etc., are rarely seen outside of Mongolia, which is very precious.

This book is published by China Science Company and is sold by Life Bookstore and others. (Yu)

### "A Comprehensive Record of Chinese Local Chronicles"

— Ji Dan

In Zhu Shijia's "Comprehensive Record of Chinese Local Chronicles," published by the Commercial Press before the war, the following record was found regarding "Pingxiang County Chronicle": Book Title, Number of Volumes, Compiler's Surname, Year, Collection Institution, Pingxiang County Chronicle, Eight Volumes, Compiled by Shang Chongnian, Kangxi 22, Beijing. Nanjing. Palace Museum. Liu's. Cabinet. Same, Right, 12 Volumes, Compiled by Xu Shengwu, Qianlong 49, Nanjing. Same, Right, 16 Volumes, Compiled by Huang Jun, This Light, Guoxue Same, Right, 11 Volumes, Compiled by Chen Qiaocong, Xianfeng 10, Nanjing. Guoxue.

Zhongshan. Culture. Beijing Same, Right, 11 Volumes Compiled by Xi Rong, Tongzhi 11, . Ren's. Xuhui. Liu's. Yanjing. External Department.

It is the case that Zhu's book was compiled based on the catalogs of various collection institutions and did not seem to be based on the original medical text. Therefore, regarding the compilers, years, and versions of "Pingxiang County Chronicle," there are bound to be omissions. Now, based on the original of "Pingxiang County Chronicle" from Tongzhi 11th year and private collections, I have written an article titled "The Evolution of the Compilation of Pingxiang County Chronicle," with a table attached at the end. Now, I will quote it here and try to make a comparison with Zhu's book.

Table of the Evolution of the Compilation of Pingxiang County Chronicle No. Dynasty, Era, Writing Date, Number of Volumes, Chief Compiler First Ming, Zhengde 13 (1518) Gao Gui Second Ming, Wanli 7 (1579) Chang Zixin Third Ming, Wanli 14 (1586) Yao Yili Fourth Ming, Wanli 24 (1596) Lu Shiji Fifth Qing, Kangxi 2nd (1683) Eight Shang Chongnian Sixth Qing, Qianlong 49 (1784) Three Xu Shengwu Seventh Qing, Jiaqing 16 (1811) Twenty Zhang Pengfu Eighth Qing, Daoguang 3 (1823) Six Huang Jun Ninth Qing, Tongzhi 11 (1872) 10 Wang Ming

It is found that there are three points that should be corrected in Zhu's book. First: The Huang Jun compilation article should be corrected to Daoguang 3rd year. Second: The Xi Rong compilation article should be corrected to Wang Ming; the compilation of this chronicle was initiated by Xi Rong, and Wang began to complete it, as seen in the preface written by Wang. Third: The Chen Qiaocong compilation article is unreliable. According to the "Yuanzhou Prefecture Chronicle" of Tongzhi 13th year, there is Chen Qiaocong's "Preface to the Essential Points of Yuanzhou Prefecture and County Chronicles," which narrates in detail: "In the winter of Xianfeng 9th year, Qiaocong received a letter from the governor and temporarily held the seal of this prefecture. At the beginning of his arrival, following the old practice, he requested the prefecture chronicle, but the boards were destroyed by the bandits and could not be recovered. He requested various chronicles, but they all said that the boards and registers had been lost after the bandits, and he felt deeply embarrassed. For several months, in meeting with people from the prefecture, he often searched for remaining books and gradually found various old chronicles of the prefecture and counties. In his spare time, he opened and read them and thought of discussing with the people of the prefecture to re-collect and revise the new chronicle, but only because he was in a time of many events and difficulties, his strength could not reach it. Considering that the prefecture and county chronicles are really related to politics, even if the new chronicle cannot be continued, it is not the responsibility of the soldiers to let the old chronicles be buried? ... Qiaocong then took various chronicles and extracted the evolution, boundaries, capitals, villages, city walls, mountains, rivers, water conservancy, passes, terrain, land taxes, population, schools, government offices, military garrisons, bridges, and post stations, and other important elements, and first paid for engraving. According to the old books, they were used as evidence of transmission; in the future, they were used as a place for continuation. Readers should appreciate his hard work and do not blame him for being incomplete." At the beginning of the same book, "The Surnames of the Prefects Who Have Revised the Prefecture Chronicle": "Engraved in the Gengshen year of Xianfeng, the prefect Chen Qiaocong." It means that "Pingxiang County Chronicle" and "Yuanzhou Prefecture Chronicle" were re-printed and published in the same year, not formally compiled, which is self-evident. At that time, it was just after the failure of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and local government affairs were waiting to be revived. Therefore, Chen urgently printed this chronicle as a basis for administering politics. Therefore, that article should also be revised to Chen reprinting, so as to avoid spreading rumors. Moreover, among the books, situations similar to the above should not be small. We sincerely hope that Zhu will take advantage of the establishment of the Provincial and County Literature Committees to conduct a universal investigation, and then revise this book carefully so that it can be perfected. I donate this proposal, and I think that all scholars engaged in local chronicles in the country are also happy to advocate and support it.

### Review of "World Politics Handbook"

— Wei Yang

In the current world where international political dynamics are extremely complex and subtle, it is not easy to understand the essence of the politics of various countries. Most books discussing international politics are either biased or have different backgrounds. When choosing, the author is in danger of being misled if he is not careful. Taking the "World Politics Handbook 1947" edited by Chen Yuan, which was recently published by Life Bookstore, for example, although the editor proclaimed in the preface that "we strive to analyze the evolution and development of the politics and economy of various countries during and after the war from a new perspective and from the standpoint of the people," we deeply feel after reading it that the editor's attitude is very problematic. It can be found in many places in the book that he is looking at the world from the perspective of the Soviet Union and looking at China from the standpoint of the Chinese Communist Party!

This biased attitude is already evident in the "Reference Materials Used" section of the book's preface. The domestic newspapers listed in that section for the editor's reference, in addition to Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, are the Times Daily and Xinhua Daily. In such a large country as China, with thousands of newspapers, why only choose these few?

In the Chinese section of the book, the editor described the process of negotiations and the breakdown of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and did not mention a word about the arrogance, ambition, and breach of contract of the Communist Party. In the lines, he implicitly attributed the responsibility for the spread of the civil war to the government. Furthermore, more than three hundred pages were used to publish the military positions of both sides on January 13, 1946, which the Communist Party demanded to be restored. In fact, everyone understands that the so-called "liberated areas" maintained by the Communist Party at that time were the result of expanding the territory at the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and it was only natural for the government to recover them. The editor's other intentions can be seen here.

In the chapter on "The United States," the Truman government is first attacked as "reversing the course of history," and the anti-Soviet elements in the Democratic and Republican parties are referred to as "reactionaries." Then, it is pointed out that the United States is using gold-dollar diplomacy to invade the world. However, the impact of the Soviet Union's activities on the US foreign policy after the war is ignored and not discussed at all. On the contrary, in the chapter on "The Soviet Union," not a word is mentioned about the Soviet Union's various attempts to expand its territory after the war and its unfriendly attitude towards our country. The behavior of the Soviet Union in signing non-aggression treaties with Germany and Japan in the early stage of World War II is deliberately defended. All of this makes one wonder if the book was published by the Soviet Union?

In other parts of the book, eight or nine out of ten are copied from the 1947 World Politics Handbook compiled by the American Foreign Relations Association, and even the arrangement procedure is still arranged in the order of the letters of the English names of the countries, so there is a lack of geographical connection. There are many typographical errors in the English original names attached to the book. In addition, the geographical location of various countries that have an important relationship with international politics is not introduced, which is the shortcoming of the book.

### Examining “Ode to Mount Ling” Through Commentary on "Ode to Mount Ling"

Logically, I should have read "Ode to Mount Ling" before reading its critique. However, I first read Mr. Mei Lin of the Ta Kung Pao's "The Realm and Character of Ode to Mount Ling," and only then felt compelled to look at "Ode to Mount Ling" itself. This is because I am not only dissatisfied with the "Ode to Mount Ling" introduced in Mr. Mei Lin's "The Realm and Character of Ode to Mount Ling," but I also find his introduction and criticism confusing and hollow.

Let's take the two poems, "Vibration" and "Gaze," cited by Mr. Mei Lin as examples. After carefully appreciating and savoring them, I believe that the so-called "character" is only expressed in the two lines, "Alas, what pious pride, and even more, what proud piety," which have some meaning. As for the rest, we can not only arrange them into prosaic and unfluent sentences, but phrases like "fields stretch wide," "yet I see you more filled and—far beautiful," "...strength of mind sprouts," "...nurturing wilderness," seem simply a somewhat clumsy accumulation. The vocabulary such as "stretch wide," "far beautiful," "sprouts," and "nurturing wilderness," we not only rarely hear in spoken language, but also struggle to find in past written vocabulary. Granted, the beauty of poetry lies in its conciseness and implicitness, enabling it to convey meaning beyond direct words, a tune beyond the strings, at least to be able to express a certain image and artistic conception that it wants to express. However, we cannot select it to be as constricted as a small-footed woman, or even strive for novelty while failing to express any sentiment.

Furthermore, the impression these two poems give us is merely the emotional foam of disillusionment and contradiction of intellectuals. We do not smell any Promethean-like heroic sanctity, only a chaotic spinning within the author's small circle of bewildered emotions. The author does not, like Shelley, give us a more accurate portrayal of that fire-stealing Prometheus, nor create an otherworldly realm beyond the ordinary. Yet Mr. Mei Lin emptily praises this illusory thing with all sorts of descriptive vocabulary. I wonder what basis this kind of review is based on? From the poem itself, we cannot obtain a unified and progressively complete concept, nor can we gain a clearer impression through its introduction.

"This magnificent and tragic whirlpool of blood, this heavy breaking of the earth's crust, arises from the desperate entanglement of life, history, and the times, from the most intense and resolute internal struggles, from the blood droplets of the soul, from the stubbornness of steel, from the fiery heat of volcanoes, from the unceasing white hair, from countless wrinkles, from the sublime character resembling Mount Ling...."

This is Mr. Mei Lin's heap of empty and irrelevant descriptions of "Ode to Mount Ling." But if we examine the realm and character of "Ode to Mount Ling" from the perspective of "the most intense" to "the fiery heat of volcanoes," it feels even more vague and elusive. We do not know what is meant by "the most intense," nor what kind of realm and character the fiery heat of volcanoes represents. Honestly, describing any work with such disjointed and empty adjectives is simply like a blind man senselessly talking about the weather; it is impossible to grasp the essence of the work itself. No matter how moving the words are, the resulting effect probably does not even reach one-ten-thousandth of what is being praised. Because the talent of a critic is not just about using a set of beautiful descriptive vocabulary to complete his critical purpose of the work without any basis, but rather about more concretely and appropriately pointing out its merits and demerits from the close, abstract, and broad aspects of the work itself. As for the author's gains and losses, benefits and harms, the critic cannot be biased. As Mr. Mei Lin in the first paragraph pressed down what..."a steel hoop-like pressing cold light, the solemnity of a saint-like absolute unyielding" inflated speaking hat, and then made his own self-justifying answer; after using all the empty rhetoric of history, it is not enough to smear the essence of the facts. Then, speaking of the realm and character expressed in "Ode to Mount Ling," the author's attitude toward the world, even if there are admirable aspects, but from the work itself that reveals the rules, we not only cannot compare it with Shelley's "Prometheus Unbound," but even with Mr. Guo Moruo's "The Dog of Heaven," we cannot put them on the same level. Now let me briefly discuss what I have seen after reading "Ode to Mount Ling" due to this curiosity:

"Ode to Mount Ling" is undoubtedly completed by the author's lack of poetic cultivation and the excessive emotions of intellectuals pursuing fantasy. Therefore, in terms of technique, the tone is not bright and lively, and the expression of the artistic conception is not unrestrained and transcendent. However, because the author seems sincere as a person, he also reveals the illusions and contradictions that the author has in the poetic realm between skillfully expressing inner emotional changes. This kind of attitude should be discussed separately. Speaking of writing poetry, the author is obviously unfamiliar, such as the use of "resignation," "grayish reflection," "locked in..." such "beautiful" and "far beautiful," as well as "forever beautiful light shining life," "...light glowing years" and other poetic phrases and vocabulary, rather than saying that we want it to be understood by adding annotations and secret codes, it is better to say that they are bones seen with fat condiments.

The artistic conception of Ode to Mount Ling, perhaps what Mr. Mei Lin calls "realm," how far and deep does it ultimately reach? From the book itself, it does not, like Shelley, still carve an artistic conception with temporal and spatial creation within the wondrous and unknowable limits of creation. We compare these poems with Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind," "To a Skylark," or Gorky's "Song of the Stormy Petrel," and discerning people will naturally not find it difficult to appreciate the height of their expressive power.

As for "Gaze" and "Vibration," they are really not as good as the sighs of a patient in a hazy state of consciousness. When the patient is clear-headed, he will say insightful words that are difficult for good people to think of. When the condition is severe, he will say scary nonsense. The author is only in this state of a patient. This is also the author's naiveté and sincerity in writing. From another perspective, it seems to have something to take. If this is taken as the highest realm expressed by "Ode to Mount Ling," it truly cannot help but make people feel regretful and confused.
