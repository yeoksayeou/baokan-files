### Two Bills on US Treasury Bills and Public Bonds Passed: Minister of Finance Yu Attends and Provides Detailed Explanation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The 320th meeting of the Fourth Session of the Legislative Yuan was held at the Legislative Yuan hall at 9:20 AM on the 27th. Present were 105 members including Liu Keshu, Chen Guyuan, Lou Tongsun, Lin Bin, and Di Ying. President Sun chaired the meeting. After reporting items, the chairman declared a change in the agenda to first discuss the report from the Finance Committee in conjunction with the Economic Committee, reviewing the two draft bills of the Short-Term Treasury Bill Ordinance of the 36th Year and the US Dollar Public Bond Ordinance of the 36th Year. Minister Yu Hongjun was invited to attend and provide explanations, and answer numerous questions from the members. After about an hour, he left the meeting. The bill was then passed with amendments.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The government's issuance of 400 million US dollar bonds has completed the legislative process at the 320th regular meeting of the Fourth Session of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 27th, and sales will begin on April 1st. Finance Minister Yu Hongjun attended the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 27th and, when reporting on the issuance process, explained that the main purpose of this measure was to absorb floating capital, stabilize finance, and achieve a balanced budget. He also pointed out that the interest rate on the issued bonds was quite generous, and the public would surely compete to purchase them enthusiastically. He solemnly declared that this measure was the most important step for the government to establish credibility with the people, benefiting both the country and the people. He guaranteed that the to-be-organized Fund Management Committee would be open and sound. The following is a summary of Yu's report: After the announcement of the economic emergency measures plan, the authorities paid close attention to rectifying tax collection and handling enemy and puppet assets in order to reduce issuance and stabilize finance, thereby balancing the budget. However, the above two tasks could not be effective immediately, and there was an extreme abundance of floating capital in Shanghai, with funds concentrated. Banks were seeking outlets one after another, rushing towards securities and consuls. Without effective measures, it would be difficult to avoid trouble. The authorities felt that in order to achieve a balanced budget, in addition to relying on tax increases and other measures, the issuance of public bonds should be considered. When the Ministry of Finance considered this issue, it paid attention to the following points: First, people are generally profit-seeking. If the interest rate on public bonds is not high, it is not easy to arouse people's interest. Therefore, the treasury bill interest rate was set at two percent, which can be said to be quite generous. Changes in laws and regulations often lead to a loss of credibility with the people. Therefore, when issuing public bonds, it is necessary to provide the public with guarantees. This time, the issuance of bonds includes the organization of a fund management committee, in which local figures and legal entities can participate in addition to the government. In addition, all funds are guaranteed by enemy and puppet assets and state-owned enterprises, and are handed over to the committee in advance. In this way, the people can feel that there is a guarantee. In terms of interest, the interest rate on short-term treasury bills is two percent, which is unprecedented. At that time, some people thought that it would be difficult to maintain in the future. When the Ministry of Finance considered it, it believed that one percent or one and a half percent was not uncommon in the Shanghai market, and two percent annual interest was not too high. From the government's point of view, it was already very high, but if 4.6 trillion legal tender can be quickly absorbed in a short period of time, the interest point does not need to be considered. Talking about the repayment of principal and interest, the principal will be repaid in the future based on the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank on that day, which is in line with the conditions for principal protection. Therefore, although the interest rate is lower than the market rate, the people also feel it is beneficial. The interest rate on US dollar bonds is set at six percent because US dollar bonds are long-term deposits, and US dollars and other foreign currency deposits or cash and gold are used to purchase them. Deposits held abroad have a six percent interest rate, which is already very high. The government's handling of deposits held abroad has already drafted the Jia Bao Ordinance, which will be sent to the Legislative Yuan. The authorities will ensure that these funds find a way out and are fully utilized. In addition, freezing gold notes is not a solution. The authorities intend to absorb them. In order to show great credibility, the government stipulates in Article 6 that the National Government will issue an order stating that US dollar bonds will definitely be repaid in US dollars in the future to show credibility to the people.

### Purchasing Public Bonds with Gold: 50 US Dollars per Ounce

Another key point is the gold exchange rate, which will be stipulated by the Ministry of Finance in a separate order. If public bonds are purchased with gold, the exchange rate will be calculated at 50 US dollars per ounce, in other words, it will increase from 480,000 to 600,000, an increase of 20 percent, which is also one of the absorption methods. Yu concluded: This measure was repeatedly discussed with the Shanghai banking community in advance. The government eagerly hopes to use this opportunity to show great credibility to the world, to start afresh, and to make the people deeply feel that these bonds are truly guaranteed. This matter is beneficial to the country and beneficial to the people. It is hoped that after the issuance, at least a portion of floating capital can be absorbed to meet current needs. In response to questions, Yu said: The government had considered changing the repayment period for short-term treasury bills from three years to two years. However, such a change would result in too rapid repayment, and the floating capital would be released soon after it was absorbed, creating too much pressure, which would negate the original intention. Therefore, it was set at three years. Some legislators suggested that one hundred million US dollars of short-term treasury bills be issued on a trial basis first. Yu repeatedly disagreed, believing that if only one hundred million US dollars were issued, it would not be of much help to the current financial situation, and hoped that the people would have firm confidence, and believed that all current measures that reduce issuance and contract currency should be taken. Technically, it can be discussed, but the number cannot be changed. If these symptomatic measures are combined with fundamental solutions, it will not be difficult to stabilize prices and finance, and it will not be difficult to overcome the difficulties. The economy may also see a turning point. It is hoped that courage can be mustered. Yu finally solemnly stated that the issuance of bonds this time is entirely free subscription, and there is no intention of apportionment. At the same time, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, he guaranteed that the organization of the Fund Management Committee will be open and sound, and the entire meeting responded with warm applause.

### Lou Tongsun Receives Our Newspaper Reporter, Discusses the Significance of Issuing Bonds, Guiding Floating Capital into the Broad Path of Construction

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Economic authority Lou Tongsun, when receiving our newspaper reporter on the 27th, spoke about his feelings on the government's issuance of 400 million US dollar bonds, saying: From the perspective of channeling floating capital, stabilizing the currency value, and gradually stabilizing prices, so as to seek to restore economic normalcy, I think no one would disagree in principle with the issuance of 400 million US dollar bonds this time. Since the implementation of the emergency plan, private gold notes, especially gold, have mostly been frozen and immobile. If such a large portion of wealth is left unused for a long time without finding ways to guide and use it, it would be a great loss to the entire national economy. The meaning and purpose of issuing 100 million US dollar public bonds should be to avoid this loss and to give gold notes a way out. The harm of floating capital has long been criticized and painfully felt by the people of the country. At the same time, this floating capital is like a strange monster that is invisible, inaudible, traceless, and erratic. It is really "easier said than done" to completely defeat and thoroughly eliminate it in our country's social organization and the current financial and fiscal system. However, this monster must be stopped from its activities or its activities must be improved, otherwise it will be difficult for our general economic situation to return to normal. Issuing public bonds is a legitimate means of national finance (national finance is nothing more than taxation, raising funds, and issuing currency). The government should have implemented it many years ago. However, the responsible authorities in the past did not do this, and instead used various trading methods "especially selling gold" to compete with the people in the market for profit, which was a mistake in seeking fiscal compensation. We must not repeat this mistake and should quickly return to the proper fiscal path. On the one hand, it opens up a way out for floating capital, attracting it and allowing it to enter normal financial savings institutions in the first step, and then cooperate with the government's guidance and management. In the second step, it is transferred to the broad path of production and construction. On the other hand, it can make legal tender return to the market, avoiding the continued expansion of currency. Stabilizing the currency value is also stabilizing prices, so that the state's financial revenue and expenditure, whether in deficit or not, or the amount of the deficit, can be obtained with a more true and certain number, and then we can talk about a fundamental solution to the overall economy. "For example, currency reform, tax system adjustment, etc.," so that the country can move towards the new economy and new construction, to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. The issuance of 300 million US dollar short-term treasury bills this time, converted to 3.6 trillion legal tender, is a number that cannot be considered too large, but if it can be promoted to the fullest extent, re-establish national credibility, and then be properly coordinated in other aspects, it can be said to have great significance and it is not difficult to achieve the expected results. Based on the above views, I believe that this bond issuance is a method that is suitable for the times and should gain the trust and support of the financial community and the people of the whole country. Economic crises are often more profound and severe than political or military crises. In order to save the crisis before the play, before there are other better evaluation methods, it is indeed impossible not to trust the government and support this relatively most legitimate and reasonable financial method. But in the end, there are still two points that must be brought to the special attention of the government. First, the supervisory committee established in the regulations must be organized in a sound manner and must be absolutely open. Second, at the very least, our government must say that within the terms of these two public bonds (treasury bills for three years and public bonds for ten years), within ten years, our government must always faithfully implement every word of every sentence stipulated in the regulations for these two types of public bonds. No matter what unexpected circumstances or changes occur, there must not be any measures that affect credibility in the slightest. This is very important. If the above two points cannot be fully achieved, then the national credit will never be restored, and we will inevitably fall into a tragic situation of complete bankruptcy. This responsibility is too great, and I sincerely hope that the responsible authorities will give it careful and serious consideration at the beginning of the implementation of these two public bonds passed by the Legislative Yuan.

### The Total Amount of Floating Capital in the Shanghai Black Market Reaches 2 Trillion: Jian Guansan Advocates Raising the Standard of Living for the Middle and Lower Classes

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Legislator Jian Guansan said: The issuance of US treasury bills is roughly in line with my previous advocacy of stopping gold trading, nationalizing foreign currencies, and purchasing foreign deposits with public bonds, but there are conditions that require special attention in terms of economics and implementation methods. (1) US dollar bonds are more profitable than treasury bills. When promoting sales in the future, the country should be divided into several major regions to organize sales committees. (2) When repaying the principal in the future, if it is used to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad for industrial construction, the government should provide special convenience to show encouragement. (3) These two public grievances are sufficient. Treasury bills alone cannot save the financial and economic crisis. Expenses should be reduced as much as possible, preparations should be made to rectify the currency, control the concentration of wealth, eliminate bureaucratic capital, raise the standard of living of the middle and lower classes, and promote industrial construction, so that there may be a change in the overall situation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Social and economic scholar Jian Guansan said: The issuance of US dollar public bonds and treasury bills this time is, from a financial point of view, intended to subsidize the deficit budget and reduce the number of national claims issued and the rate of circulation. From an economic point of view, since January 17th of this year, few holders of gold and foreign currency have exchanged them for national currency at the Central Bank. A large amount of gold and foreign currency is neither exchanged for national currency nor can it be used as currency for transactions, so it becomes dead goods or dead capital. This time, the issuance of US dollar public bonds stipulates that they must be purchased with gold or foreign currency, in the hope of turning this type of dead capital into semi-circulating capital, directly making the economic situation more flexible, and indirectly slightly reducing the threat of black market interest rates. As for the issuance of short-term treasury bills, it is aimed at absorbing floating capital. It is said that there is about 2 trillion yuan of black market floating capital in Shanghai alone. If this large amount of black market floating capital causes trouble, it will be like bandits scurrying around in all directions, and the harm will be severe. The issuance of 300 million US dollar treasury bills this time is to absorb a large amount of floating capital in order to reduce its rampant momentum.

### Minister Bai Broadcasts a Report on the Truth of the Taiwan Incident: The Plan to Reorganize Taiwan Province Will Soon Be Promulgated

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th] Bai Chongxi gave a broadcast to compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese on the Taiwan Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM today, reporting on the Taiwan incident. The full text is as follows: This unfortunate incident occurred in Taiwan. After many observations, I have learned the truth and now have a full understanding. This is because compatriots have been under Japanese rule for 51 years. The Japanese implemented narrow-minded and vicious education, distorting the Chinese government, people, and army, causing compatriots to despise the motherland and the people and army of the motherland, resulting in deep resentment. Therefore, the compatriots had a preconceived and deeply ingrained negative impression, which is the remote cause of the riot. After the restoration, the Chinese Communist Party maliciously propagated at home, slandering the Chinese Kuomintang government and the revolutionary army, and raised troops to create chaos, hoping to overthrow the government. A small number of Communist Party members and ambitious people in Taiwan also spread rumors and incited the public in Taiwan, using smuggling cases to stir up the riotous tidal wave of the February 28th Incident. We can see from the so-called 32 conditions and the orders, declarations, and slogans issued by rioters in various places that they not only demanded political reforms, but also used violence to besiege the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Garrison Headquarters, as well as the important fortresses of Keelung and Kaohsiung, and air force bases, military supplies warehouses, etc. Their attempt was to overthrow the government and seize power, and their actions were extremely narrow-minded and cruel. More than a thousand public education personnel and their families who came to Taiwan from the mainland to help build Taiwan and educate the children of Taiwan were killed and injured by rioters. This is a general outline of the riot, and it is indeed a distressing thing. I arrived in Taipei on March 17th and exchanged opinions with the local government and public opinion organs to inquire about the course of events. On the 20th, I set off to inspect the fortresses of Keelung and Kaohsiung that had been attacked by rioters, and passed through Pingtung, Fengshan, Tainan, Taichung, Changhua, Hsinchu, and Taoyuan counties and cities. These places were occupied by rioters during the incident and were in extreme chaos. Now order has been restored, and people have resumed their businesses and are working as usual. Order was restored in Taitung even earlier, which is very gratifying. Except for a small number of Communist Party members and rioters who are fleeing into the mountains out of fear of punishment, the vast majority of Taiwanese compatriots are able to understand the righteousness, support the motherland, and are not incited by the rebels. As for the central government's future policy of governing Taiwan, it is drafting a proper plan that meets the requirements of the Taiwanese people. Generally speaking, in the political aspect, it is planned to change the administrative chief executive office system to a provincial government system, but in order to meet actual needs, several additional offices will be added. Personnel in the various departments of the provincial government will give priority to qualified and outstanding local people. In the economic aspect, it is planned to actively rectify public enterprises and support private enterprises. In education, we should strengthen the national language and actively spread the traditional morality and culture of the motherland, while thoroughly eliminating the remaining poison, so that Taiwan and the motherland can be closely integrated and enhance the feelings of Taiwanese compatriots and compatriots across the country. These implementation plans will soon be promulgated.

Although Taiwan is separated from the motherland by only a strip of water, because it has been occupied for half a century, people in the mainland and overseas Chinese are deeply concerned that they may not be fully aware of the Taiwan incident, and it is inevitable that false information will be passed around, leading to a loss of truth. Therefore, I will make a fair and clear report on the truth of the Taiwan incident so that compatriots who care about Taiwan can rest assured.

Taiwan is an important national defense base in China. Most of the people of Taiwan came from various provinces in Fujian and Guangdong. They are related to compatriots in the country by blood and share common interests. I deeply hope that compatriots across the country will understand Taiwan more, help Taiwan more, and I also deeply hope that Taiwanese compatriots will uphold the spirit of the nation above all else, love the motherland, and love each other with compatriots across the country, and work together to build a new Taiwan based on the Three Principles of the People, and build a united, unified, and strong Republic of China.

### British Representative Refuses to Participate in the Exchange of Information on China

[French News Agency, Moscow, 26th] US Secretary of State Marshall recently proposed that the three powers exchange information on China. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov sent similar notes to Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin, expressing agreement to exchange information on China by April 1 and to notify the Chinese government of the information. However, the British delegation today refused to participate in the exchange of information, saying that Britain has no representatives stationed in North China and therefore has no information to exchange. Britain's only reason for participating in discussions on China is that Britain participated in the 1945 Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference and endorsed the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs at the meeting.

### Draft Law on the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives: Lively Discussion in the Legislative Yuan, Women Representatives Increased to 291

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] When the Legislative Yuan discussed the draft law on the election and recall of National Assembly representatives on the 27th, the issue of the number of women and professional representatives aroused fierce debate. "Everyone has their own reasons" (quoting legislator Zhong Tianxin), in a lively and tense atmosphere mixed with laughter, after face-to-face disputes, they shook hands and made peace. The whole day's meeting was not dull at all. In addition to Gu Zhenggang attending to explain, more than ten women's representatives including Luo Heng and Bao Deming attended to listen in, and President Sun's wife also attended to show support. The visitors' gallery was full. Representatives of professional groups, such as Wang Xiaolai, perched high next to the film projector, like a theater box. Whenever a legislator spoke in their favor, applause followed.

When discussing the number of representatives, the principle of "ladies first" was followed, and the number of women representatives was discussed first. Five female legislators, Zhao Maohua, Tan Tiwu, and Cai Yan, spoke one after another. Some requested that the number of women representatives should account for one-hundredth of the total, some advocated that it should be maintained at 20 percent, and others believed that 20 percent was only the starting point, not the end point. They also pointed out that women have made great contributions to the country and society, and it is absolutely impossible to limit them because the National Assembly Hall will be too small to accommodate them in the future. Male legislator Zhong Tianxin said that everyone has their own reasons. If it is to be considered reasonable, a solution should be sought in the constitution. The regional representatives to be elected in the future are not all male, and men and women have equal opportunities. In a humorous tone, he hoped that women representatives could account for more than 80 percent of the total in the future, "so that we men can be a little more idle." Jian Guansan pointed out that women also had a period of showing off their power in the past, that is, even though men currently have a slight advantage in society, there is no shortage of "henpecked" men in the family. We should not just settle old scores. Jian supported women representatives accounting for one-tenth of the total, but hoped that the representatives elected in the future should take into account various issues when meeting, and should not be limited to speaking for women. In the end, the total number of female representatives was increased to one-tenth, a total of 291, of which 71 were professional representatives. Following the discussion of the number of professional representatives, there was general opposition to this system, and some advocated reducing it from 450 to 250. However, because of the decision of the National Defense Council, it was inconvenient to change, and the decision was still made according to the original number. In addition, some legislators also raised opinions on the allocation of the number of representatives of overseas Chinese and national representatives with special living habits in the mainland, but they were all passed according to the original number. Today's discussion continued to Article 4, on the 28th

### Measures for Handling Deposits Held Abroad: Will Be Announced After Approval by the National Defense Council

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Measures for handling my deposits held abroad have been sent to the National Defense Council and may be announced soon. According to someone who drafted the measures: There was a clause in the measures that "deposits held abroad should be deposited in national banks in the original currency," but without interest. Now, seeing the provisions in the US Dollar Public Bond Ordinance that there are clauses for purchasing public bonds with foreign currency, then after deposits held abroad are unfreezed and declared, they can be transferred to purchase public bonds, because public bonds not only have interest, but also have very high interest. This point is enough to give deposits held abroad one more way out. It is also heard that the measures are expected to be passed by the National Defense Council recently. The deadline for declaration is only one month, and those who violate it will be sentenced to imprisonment for one to five years.

Editorial

### The Issuance of US Dollar Bonds

The Supreme National Defense Council, in its regular meeting on the 26th, approved two proposals: the issuance of short-term treasury bonds worth US$300 million and US dollar public bonds worth US$100 million. News of this was reported in this newspaper yesterday and today. Regarding the denominations, the short-term treasury bonds are divided into six types: 5,000, 1,000, 100, and 50, etc. The interest rate is 2% per annum, payable every six months, with a principal repayment period of three years. The US dollar public bonds are divided into five denominations: 5,000, 1,000, 100, and 50. The interest rate is 6% per annum, payable every six months, with a principal repayment period of ten years. Regarding the collateral, the short-term treasury bonds are secured by designated units from state-owned production enterprises and enemy/puppet properties that are prepared for sale. The principal and interest payments of the US dollar public bonds will be backed by the government's designated US dollar reserves. Regarding the purpose, the short-term treasury bonds will be used to stabilize the financial situation, and the US dollar bonds will be used to replenish foreign exchange reserves and regulate foreign trade. Regarding the issuance method, they will be sold at the Central Bank's US dollar exchange rate, converted from national currency to US dollars, or purchased with US dollar deposits and other foreign currency deposits, or with gold. It was also decided that a fund management committee would be established for both the treasury bonds and public bonds to handle the supervision of the funds. After the legislative principles of the two proposals were submitted to the Legislative Yuan, the legislative procedures were completed at yesterday's legislative meeting, and the regulations for the treasury bonds and public bonds will be officially promulgated soon. This is a new measure taken by the government to overcome financial difficulties after the implementation of the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan."

Since the announcement of the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," general observers have considered that the government's budget balance and the absorption of domestic floating capital and foreign exchange deposits abroad will likely follow the path of issuing bonds. During the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, it was originally planned to issue "Price Index Bonds." This method was theoretically sound, but there were many technical problems, so it was not approved. Therefore, the Supreme National Defense Council recently made the decision to issue the above two types of bonds. The news was well received by the financial community in Shanghai. It is generally believed that issuing bonds at this time is a good opportunity to withdraw legal tender, channel gold and foreign currency into the formal market, and the interest rate is very high, so people will be happy to buy them; however, what everyone is concerned about is the issue of the purpose of the bond. Originally, the national financial road lines are nothing more than taxes, public bonds and issuance of currency. Taxes are limited, and the people's strength is exhausted, and the road to taxes seems to be exhausted, so we cannot actively take the road of "increasing taxes" or "raising taxes". The issuance of currency has already created an extremely high peak, and this dangerous road can no longer be taken. The matters related to the issuance of currency in the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" seem to have realized that this road can no longer be taken. Bonds are more reasonable and normal, with uses and guarantees, and legal protection, and are a good opportunity to absorb floating capital at present. Therefore, our view on the issuance of these two types of US dollar bonds is the same as that of the general public. It is believed that this measure can absorb floating capital and foreign exchange, and can absorb frozen gold.

The total amount of the two bonds is US$400 million. If one US dollar is equivalent to 12,000 yuan in legal tender, it will be a total of 4.8 trillion yuan in legal tender. This number is indeed very large, and it must be promoted and used carefully. Regarding promotion, a widespread promotion method must be adopted. Shanghai's floating capital mostly flows in from the interior, and it should be promoted to the people. However, when promoting to the people, it is first necessary to avoid the compulsory allocation by local officials, which will destroy the credit of the bonds. This must be noted! This is one point. When the government promulgated the "Economic Emergency Measures Plan," it clearly ordered that private foreign exchange held abroad should be declared to the government, and the government would purchase it at a fixed exchange rate on a regular basis. This measure is very wise and has won the support of public opinion. However, there are doubts about the progress of the handling. Therefore, the issuance of US dollar public bonds this time should be undertaken first by people who have foreign exchange deposits abroad, and even the use of diplomatic or political compulsion methods is not considered impatient. Moreover, this is beneficial to those who hold gold and foreigners, so why not do it? At the same time, it can also balance international payments for the country. This is the second point. Regarding the repayment of the two bonds upon maturity, the Legislative Yuan should pay attention to the liquidity of the bonds when deliberating on the regulations and must protect them. The regulations stipulate that payment should be made in US dollars and must be done so, regardless of how the foreign exchange rate will be in the future. Do not repeat the mistake of discounting past gold savings. Therefore, the regulations must prevent this and must establish administrative remedies in advance. This will restore the government's credibility. This is the third point. Regarding the use of the bonds, the news says that it is for "stabilizing the financial situation," which seems vague. In short, 4.8 trillion yuan in legal tender can be used for a lot of purposes when the government is shrinking the currency supply, and it must be paid in a normal way to win people's hearts. It is not possible to make up for this year's large budget deficit. The Supreme National Defense Council recently decided to reduce expenditures by 146.4 billion yuan and postpone payments of 85 billion yuan to the second half of the year in order to balance the budget. If it can be saved and if it is tight, there should be no need to make up for it or add to it, then the financial revenue and expenditure will be able to maintain a balance. Since the financial revenue and expenditure can be balanced, the bond income this time should undoubtedly be used for production and construction to actively promote national economic construction. The "Economic Reform Plan" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee has a broad vision and is a fundamental strategy. Therefore, it is more meaningful and valuable to reasonably pay the bond income to economic construction. If so, everyone will rise up to protect it, everyone will compete to buy it, and the important decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee will not fail!

### Prospects for Dutch-Indonesian Relations

The Linggadjati Agreement draft agreed upon by the Netherlands and Indonesia on November 15 of last year was signed and established on the 25th. The main points of this agreement are as follows: (1) The Netherlands recognizes the Republic of Indonesia as the de facto political authority on the islands of Java, Madura, and Sumatra; (2) The Republic of Indonesia will join Borneo and the Greater East Archipelago to form the Federation of Indonesia; (3) The Federation of Indonesia and the Kingdom of the Netherlands will form a union, the United States of Indonesia, with the Queen of the Netherlands as the head of state. However, the joint union and the United States should be established on January 1, 1949; (4) The areas occupied by the Dutch army in Indonesia should be handed over to the Republic of Indonesia before January 1, 1949; (5) After the establishment of the United States of Indonesia, the Netherlands will introduce the Federation of Indonesia to join the United Nations. This draft agreement has undergone more than four months of deliberation by the Dutch and Indonesian parties, and it has only been signed now. This shows that the conclusion of this agreement is not easy and is indeed a valuable agreement. It will not only bring an end to the nearly two-year Dutch-Indonesian conflict but also open up a wonderful prospect for the future of Indonesian independence and the cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia. As Deputy Governor-General Van Mook said, "The period of disputes and negotiations has passed, and now is the time to develop friendship and cooperation." Whether for the benefit of both the Netherlands and Indonesia, or for the peace of the South Seas and the rights and interests of our compatriots, the signing of this agreement is worth praising. Foreign Minister Wang specially issued a statement on this matter, expressing his gratification that the Netherlands recognized Indonesian independence and hoping that the welfare and safety of our compatriots could be guaranteed from now on. This can be regarded as the common attitude of the people of our country towards the Dutch-Indonesian issue.

Since Japan's surrender, the people of Indonesia have raised the banner of national independence and liberation, demanding independence and autonomy. Although the Dutch authorities were aware of the trend of the post-war world and understood the revolutionary sentiments of the Indonesian people, they still felt somewhat reluctant to let go immediately, which made Indonesia, which had surrendered to the Japanese army, once again become a place of conflict and bloodshed between the Netherlands and Indonesia. Our country has expressed sympathy for the Indonesian movement for liberation from beginning to end and hopes that it will be successful. However, our country has three million compatriots in Indonesia, and as the saying goes, "When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the pond are affected." Their welfare and safety have been subjected to unprecedentedly serious threats, which naturally concerns us even more. During the 19 months of continued conflict, the loss of life and property of our compatriots in Indonesia is impossible to estimate, so we hope at all times that the Dutch-Indonesian conflict can be resolved peacefully on a reasonable basis. At the end of October last year, a ceasefire agreement was finally signed, which prevented large-scale conflicts from happening again, but the tense atmosphere of confrontation between the two sides still could not be eased. Fortunately, Deputy Governor-General Van Mook and Prime Minister Sjahrir are both politicians and diplomats with a broad vision, who can look at the big picture from afar, think about the big picture, and use their political wisdom to negotiate this draft agreement.

When this draft agreement was published, it caused a great uproar both in the Netherlands and in Indonesia. Especially in the Netherlands, everyone shouted slogans such as "the collapse of the empire" and "surrender to the Indonesian revolution." Not only did public opinion express dissatisfaction, but the opinions of the cabinet were also not consistent, almost causing a cabinet crisis. However, after Van Mook's efforts, coupled with the international situation's intolerance of continued Dutch-Indonesian conflict, it was finally passed by the Dutch Parliament. In Indonesia, this agreement was also unanimously considered to be too empty, and some places were ambiguous and could be interpreted differently. However, after Prime Minister Sjahrir issued a statement: "This treaty is only the first step in the struggle for independence," all parties were united under Sjahrir's leadership. Therefore, it is truly commendable that this draft agreement has been delayed until now to be signed and established!

There are many contradictions in the interpretation of this agreement by the Netherlands and Indonesia, and difficulties will inevitably arise during its implementation. However, we still hope that both the Netherlands and Indonesia can attach importance to international integrity and earnestly fulfill international treaties, and must not cause trouble again due to interests, so that the peaceful South Seas will once again fall into a state of turmoil. Therefore, we hope that the Netherlands and Indonesia can reconcile and repair relations from now on, not only to open up a new path for the friendship and cooperation between the two countries, but also to set a new example for the solution of the crisis. In addition to expressing our approval, the Chinese people urge our three million compatriots in Indonesia to work harder to promote the prosperity and strength of the emerging Republic of Indonesia and become the only stabilizing force to maintain peace in the South Seas.

### The Communist Army Obstructs the Repair of the Embankments on Both Sides of the Yellow River. Employees Repairing in Dongming Were Attacked.

[Report from Kaifeng, this newspaper, 27th] The repair project of the embankments on both sides of the old course of the Yellow River below Huayuankou has been repeatedly obstructed by the Communist army, so the work is difficult to carry out. More than a thousand Communist troops are active near Dongming, and they have declared that they will not allow the embankment to be restored. If the embankment is restored, they will destroy it again. Employees responsible for the repair work northwest of Dongming were attacked and scattered by the Communist army on the evening of the 17th, and have not yet fully returned. In areas where the Communist army has not disrupted, the progress of the work is very good.

### Side Issues Arise During the Review of the German-Austrian Question. The Future of the Foreign Ministers' Conference is Bleak. Marshall Is Growing Impatient and Issues a Warning.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th broadcast: It is reported that Marshall is deeply unhappy with the slow progress of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on the German and Austrian peace treaties, especially since last night's meeting achieved nothing. On issues large and small, the four foreign ministers have divergent opinions, and the hope of reaching an agreement on the establishment of peace is almost a bubble.

[United Press, Moscow, 27th] The hope of reaching an agreement on a European peace treaty at this Moscow conference is gradually fading today. The four foreign ministers are deadlocked on issues large and small. The prospect of completing the Austrian Peace Treaty seems quite bright, but recently twists and turns have also occurred, and the Soviet Union has refused the US proposal to immediately resolve the definition of German assets in Austria. Yesterday's four foreign ministers' meeting lasted for nearly five hours, and no decisive agreement was reached on the German and Austrian peace treaties.

[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] The four foreign ministers argued for a long time today on the issue of whether China should be a convening country for the German peace conference, but no agreement was reached. Marshall and Bevin strongly advocated that China be one of the convening countries for the peace conference, while Molotov firmly opposed it. A summary of the main points of the four foreign ministers' debate on this issue is as follows: Molotov mentioned the Potsdam Agreement and said that China was not a country that signed the German surrender instrument, so it should not be a convening country for the German peace conference. Bevin cited the discussion of this issue at the Paris Conference as an example, hoping that Molotov would no longer rehash the issue of whether or not to be a convening country in the discussion of the peace treaty of the preparatory countries, and should directly follow the example of the Paris Peace Treaty and make China a convening country for the German peace conference. Bidault said that at the beginning of the establishment of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, France was not one of its members, and France believed that once the preparatory work for the German peace treaty was completed, the four powers should abandon their special status and restore the five powers. Marshall proposed that since China is a member of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, it should be granted the same status as in Paris. Molotov continued, in Paris China was not a convening country for the peace conference, only a member of the Presidium of the General Assembly after the conference was convened, and he felt that it would not be harmful to use this method in the German peace conference.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 26th] The four foreign ministers have been unable to agree on the procedure for drafting the German peace treaty for many days. US Secretary of State Marshall, who had always been silent at the meeting, suddenly spoke sharply on the meeting today, "The side issues of the meeting have arisen, which is like binding oneself, which is meaningless in itself, but makes the chance of the meeting progressing smoothly even more slim." As a result, the four foreign ministers reached an agreement on the procedure for drafting the German peace treaty. The main points are as follows: (1) The four foreign ministers should continue to meet continuously; (2) During the meeting of the four foreign ministers, the advisory and information conference organized by the four powers and other major allies and the representatives of the countries concerned should also meet at the same time; (3) During the meeting of the political, territorial, economic, and financial standing committees, they should be guided by the four powers. The drafting of the German peace treaty according to this procedure will serve as the basis for convening the German peace conference, but opinions are still not consistent on the composition of various groups. At the same time, there are still three points that have not reached any resolutions, namely (1) the list of allied countries to be invited to participate in the future German peace conference; (2) whether China should be one of the inviting countries; (3) whether the German peace treaty should be signed by the German government. The only concrete result achieved at today's meeting of the four foreign ministers was the unanimous agreement to invite representatives from Yugoslavia and Italy to attend the meeting and present their opinions on the solution of the financial problems in the Trieste region.

### Austrian Peace Treaty in Stalemate. The Soviet Union Disposes of German Assets in the Austrian Occupation Zone. Molotov Says the United States Has No Right to Interfere.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 27th broadcast: It is reported that Molotov has declared to Marshall that any disposal of German assets in the Soviet occupation zone of Austria by the Soviet Union is irrelevant to the United States. Marshall had made a proposal to try to break the deadlock on these assets, but Molotov has now firmly rejected it, so the hope of reaching an agreement on the Austrian peace treaty as soon as possible is very bleak.

[United Press, Moscow, 27th] It is reported that Molotov told Marshall that how the Soviet Union deals with German property in the Soviet occupation zone of Austria is not related to the United States. Molotov also cited the agreement between US Ambassador Harriman and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky in 1945, in which Harriman's letter to Vyshinsky stated that "the Soviet government has the right to deal with 'German' property in Finland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and eastern Austria without consulting the British, French, and American representatives of the Allied Control Council. The British, French, and Americans may also deal with other German foreign property without consulting the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky agreed to Harriman's proposal in his reply. Although Molotov claimed that the free disposal of German property in Austria was based on the Potsdam Agreement, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Austria accused the Soviet Union of moving many non-German factories in Austria, which actually violated the secret agreement of Potsdam.

Whether this trip is just a visit to his home country of Norway or has another mission, it is difficult to obtain news from the United Nations at this time. Scandinavian Airlines also said that Lie also pre-purchased a return ticket for April 7. At the same time, in Lake Success this morning, Lie said at his first press conference since June that he deeply hoped that the United Kingdom would soon call for a special session of the United Nations to resolve the Palestine issue.

### The Soviet Union Does Not Participate in the First Meeting of the Trusteeship Council

[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] The Soviet Union refused to add to the first meeting of the United Nations Trusteeship Council today. According to the Charter, the Soviet Union, as a permanent member of the Security Council, is a member of the Trusteeship Council. This is the first time that a meeting of an important UN agency has been held without the participation of a Soviet representative since Soviet representative Gromyko dramatically withdrew from the Security Council meeting hall a year ago. Although the absence of the Soviet Union did not cause legal entanglements, it did cause concern among those responsible for the UN agency. These people were already anxious about the increasing tendency to avoid UN agencies on important issues. The confirmation of the Soviet Union's absence came 24 hours after Gromyko exercised his veto power to overturn the Security Council's majority vote supporting Britain's accusation of Albania laying mines. Secretary-General Lie also expressed his concern in his opening remarks today. Lie appealed to all member states of the United Nations to use this peaceful mechanism on all kinds of international issues, even if it is related to national survival. Lie did not directly mention President Truman's request for Congress to assist Greece and Turkey and his statement that the UN agency is currently unable to deal with the threat of totalitarianism to these countries.

### The Soviet Union Firmly Opposed Eight Draft Trusteeship Agreements

[Reuters, Lake Success, 26th] When the United Nations Trusteeship Council convened its first meeting, there was no Soviet representative. The Soviet delegation to the United Nations did not explain this. However, the meeting of the Trusteeship Council continued as usual. Although the absence of the Soviet Union made people feel somewhat uneasy, it was not unexpected. At the last United Nations General Assembly, when the draft trusteeship agreements for eight trust territories were proposed, the Soviet Union had already expressed its firm opposition, and some of its proposed amendments were rejected at that time. Therefore, its boycott of the Trusteeship Council was expected. The reasons for the Soviet Union's opposition to the military case of the individual trusteeship agreement are as follows: (1) The agreement ignores the interests of "directly related countries." The Soviet Union believes that five should be directly related countries, and according to the Charter, the trusteeship agreement must be approved by all directly related countries; (2) The administration of some trust territories is considered to be part of the governance of the strong countries; (3) The agreement has not been approved by the Security Council, and it is planned to set up armaments in the former trust territories; (4) The trust territory refuses to set a deadline to amend the trusteeship agreement. The Soviet Union's absence does not affect the procedure of the Council's work, because technically the Soviet representative is still considered to be present.

President Truman replied: I hope that Congress can quickly make a decision on the plan to assist Greece and Turkey. At this point, another trustee asked: Does the President advocate banning the Communist Party in the United States? President Truman immediately replied: Congress is currently discussing this issue, and I am not in a position to express my opinion here. Regarding domestic issues, I hope that domestic prices will not continue to rise. Some American businessmen have voluntarily reduced their prices, and I hope that labor unions will negotiate with employers because they demand higher wages and will not cause the cost of living to rise.

### Hoover Accuses US Communist Party of Attempting to Overthrow the Government; Promoting Americanism is Key to Preventing Communism

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The House Un-American Activities Committee, currently reviewing a bill to outlaw the Communist Party, summoned FBI Director Hoover to testify today. Hoover described the US Communist Party as a "fifth column" whose goal is to overthrow the government. He stated that there is no doubt that the Communist Party's true allegiance is to the Soviet Union, not the United States. The Communist Party is a "fifth column" even more organized than the fifth columns of Nazis that were active in countries they attacked in the past. Hoover did not advocate taking any action that would give the Communist Party the opportunity to portray itself as a martyr. The best antidote to Communism is a powerful, rational, and old-fashioned Americanism.

### Laying the Democratic Foundation of Local Politics: First Swearing-In of Elected District Heads; Speaker Pan Delivers Speech Hoping to Create a New Municipal Atmosphere; Mayor Wu Presides Over Oath Ceremony, Followed by Tea Reception

[Our Newspaper] The swearing-in ceremony for the elected heads and deputy heads of the city's thirty districts was held in the City Hall Auditorium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Sixty people attended, including district heads and deputy district heads from various districts, such as She Weifan and Cheng Jingyuan. Mayor Wu, Commander Yi, Speaker Pan, City Government Secretary-General He, Land Administration Bureau Director Zhu, Health Bureau Director Zhang, and Civil Affairs Office Director Zhang all participated in the ceremony. After performing the ceremony as scheduled, Cheng Jingyuan, the head of Huangpu District, led the oath-taking, and the oath was: "I solemnly swear that I will respectfully follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to implement the Three Principles of the People, abide by laws and regulations, respect the public opinion of the local people, and wholeheartedly strive for this war. I will never engage in corruption or accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath."

After the oath, Mayor Wu, as the oath administrator, delivered a training message, stating three thoughts: (1) Shanghai is the largest city in our country, and under the leadership of Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, it is moving towards a democratic path. This popular election of district heads will determine whether democratic politics can achieve its ideals, which depends entirely on how well the district heads perform their duties, so the responsibility is significant. (2) Cities in English-speaking countries do not have a district head system. This city has decided to implement this system for the first time. Whether it succeeds or fails, whether it is good or bad, depends entirely on the performance of the district heads. This not only affects the whole country but also affects the international community. Therefore, it is hoped that the district heads can assist the government to firmly establish this system in order to promote democratic politics. (3) The economy and social order are stable, political reform is needed, but for stability, the joint efforts of local governments, the council, and military police agencies are necessary. On the one hand, each district head is needed as a bridge between the government and the people, so that the government's intentions can reach the people, and the people's grievances can be reported to the government. Everyone should work together to overcome difficulties.

Speaker Pan then delivered a speech stating: Within two years of victory, this city has established a truly democratic foundation for local politics. But how effective it is and whether it is good or bad depends on how these first popularly elected district heads perform their duties. Just as schools have a school spirit and cities have a municipal atmosphere, this city used to be called a hotbed of crime due to the concessions. Now that the unequal treaties have been abolished, we want to reform our image under the leadership of Mayor Wu and work together to create a new municipal atmosphere. Since taking office, Mayor Wu has been able to get close to the people and visit and inspect rural areas to understand the hardships of the people. It is hoped that the district heads can also be close to the people and serve the people, doing what the people want and abhorring what the people hate, promoting benefits and eliminating abuses, so that a model of local autonomy can be established and democratic politics can be promoted.

Commander Xuan also delivered a speech stating: During the period of political tutelage, the Kuomintang exercised power on behalf of the people. Now that constitutional government has begun, the government is returning power to the people. Since the district heads are elected by the people, their responsibility is great to ensure that democratic politics looks like something at the beginning of its implementation. Today, Shanghai needs stability, but it is difficult to eliminate disturbances by bandits and traitors by relying solely on military police prevention and control. It is hoped that after the district heads take office, the power of self-government can be highly developed to assist the government in eliminating all adverse factors. Finally, Cheng Jingyuan delivered a response on behalf of the district heads, stating: "I feel a great sense of responsibility in being elected by the local elders in this complex environment. In the future, I hope that all officials will provide timely guidance." The ceremony ended at 4:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, Mayor Wu hosted a tea reception for the district heads at the Shaoju Road Police Club, and also invited Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, and the heads of various bureaus and offices to accompany them. Opinions were exchanged at the meeting, which was very harmonious.

### Navy Department Sends Personnel to Investigate: Invites All Parties to Talk Today; Rescued Chief Engineer Goes to Nanjing to Report Details

### Central Trust Bureau Writes to City Council for Explanation: The Truth About Automobile Imports

[Our Newspaper's Report] In response to a petition submitted to the Municipal Council by a citizen, 斯季超, requesting an investigation into the truth about the Central Trust Bureau's automobile imports, the Bureau has submitted a letter to the Municipal Government for transmittal to the Council for explanation: "During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the vehicles of various government agencies had deteriorated severely and were unusable.

The order period was before the government announced the Provisional Measures for Import Trade and the establishment of the Imports Management Office. Therefore, these vehicles could be imported without restrictions. All the vehicles that arrived in Shanghai successively were purchased and used by various ministries and departments as approved by the Executive Yuan. The Bureau acted solely as an agent."

### China Textile Corporation Hosts Journalists: Tour of Three Factories - Mostly Fine Yarn Spinning Equipment - Close Connections Between Spinning, Weaving, and Dyeing

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to provide outside information regarding the facilities of each factory under its jurisdiction, the China Textile Construction Corporation publicly hosted journalists from the city yesterday for a tour of the Second Textile Factory, the First Printing and Dyeing Factory, and the First Silk Spinning Factory. There were also five other factories included in the tour itinerary, but the tour did not reach those factories due to time constraints. At 9:30 AM yesterday, reporters from various newspapers gathered at the corporation's head office on Jiangxi Road. The tour began with a speech by the corporation's general manager, 束云章, who stated that the corporation's factories in Shanghai include 37 units across seven categories of cotton spinning, wool spinning, silk spinning, hemp spinning, knitting, and machinery. However, the corporation's factories are distributed throughout the country, and the organization is huge. Based on a rough estimate at current prices, the company's total assets should be over 3.5 trillion yuan. The cotton mills under the corporation spin cotton yarn with an average count of over 25.5, so most of the equipment is for spinning fine yarn. If we had to change to spinning coarser yarn, although it's not impossible, the machinery would have to be refitted, and a large part of it would have to be idled. As a result, production costs would increase and output would decrease, which would be a waste. The company's weaving equipment is mainly for weaving 12-pound fine cloth, and it would be equally difficult to switch to weaving 16-pound fine cloth. As for the spinning, weaving, and dyeing departments, they all have close connections. In the future, when the company is sold to private enterprises, this point must be taken into account in order to avoid losing a factory's performance due to interruptions in the production process. Subsequently, under the guidance of the corporation's deputy chief auditor, 高越天, and the design section chief, 龚苏民, the journalists visited the three factories in order.

Second Textile Factory

Formerly the Neiwai No. 5 Factory, the factory has 46,400 spindles and 23,000 thread spindles, covering a total area of 42 mu. The factory's machinery was built in 1913. When the company took it over, it could only operate a few thousand spindles, but now it is running at full capacity. Last year, the factory produced more than 12,000 bales of yarn, which is equivalent to 20-count standard yarn, and can produce more than 110 bales per day. The factory's equipment is suitable for spinning 42-count cotton yarn and can spin up to 80-count yarn.

First Silk Spinning Factory

Formerly the Kanebo No. 3 Factory, the factory covers an area of more than 35 mu and has a total of 9,900 spinning spindles, 1,470 spun silk spindles, and 313 looms, mainly producing silk and spun silk, and supplementing with Suzhou gauze and ramie spinning. The products are sold in India, Southeast Asia, and the Americas. The factory's average daily production is 474.69 kilograms of silk, 130 kilograms of yarn, 278.46 kilograms of spun silk, and 5,238.02.

First Printing and Dyeing Factory

Formerly formed by merging the No. 1 and No. 2 processing factories belonging to Neiwai Cotton. The factory covers an area of 41.29 mu, and the entire building is made of steel pillars and brick walls. The factory's machinery is divided into three major parts: power, bleaching, dyeing, printing, and finishing, and chemical. It uses 6,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 35,000 gallons of water per day, so it has its own water supply equipment. It mainly dyes and bleaches cloth, dyed cloth, and printed cloth. The famous Four Gentlemen serge is one of the factory's products. Currently, the factory can produce 9,500 pieces of cloth per day.

### Stationed at the North Station: Committing Numerous Crimes - Following the "Four Famous Mountains": "Five Tiger Generals" Cracked - Principal Offender Zhu Jinbao Arrested

The Jinghu District Railway Bureau Police Department has cracked another major pickpocketing gang case. The pickpocketing gang had considerable influence in Shanghai and was known as the "Five Tiger Generals." Their potential influence was no less than that of the "Four Famous Mountains." The mastermind, Zhu Jinbao (alias Zhou Rongbao), has also been arrested. On the morning of the 24th of this month, at around 5:00 AM, police officers from the police department were patrolling the first and second class ticket offices when they saw five young men gradually approaching the ticket window. They took the opportunity to use a blade to cut open the pocket of a passenger, 孔有根, who was buying a ticket, and stole 96,000 yuan in legal tender. The police officers then went forward and arrested them.

According to their confession: one was Zhu Jinbao, and the other was Liu Wenbin. They did not deny the pickpocketing. The suspects were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office on the afternoon of the 25th, but they were released on bail that evening. However, they did not repent. At 2:00 PM on the 26th, they returned to the North Station to "look for business," posing as passengers. Just as they were about to act, they were caught by detective Zhang Mingcao. Only Zhu Jinbao was caught at the time; Liu Wenbin had already escaped. Zhu was taken to the section headquarters for further questioning.

Reviewing old records,

it was learned that the suspect was one of the masterminds of the well-known pickpocket gang "Five Tiger Generals." Since the enemy puppet regime, he has been stationed at the North Station, specializing in pickpocketing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, committing numerous crimes, totaling thousands. After the victory, the suspects were once arrested by the Third Front Army but were released shortly thereafter. However, they did not change their ways and continued to engage in old cases at the North Station, being arrested by the station more than a dozen times. The suspect admitted to everything in the past. The Railway Police Department believes that the facts are clear and has decided to arrest the accomplices. Zhu Jinbao will be sent to court for prosecution within a few days.

### Flower Bed Trial Concluded: Buried Drug Case Contains Morphine - Only 0.2-0.3% - Argued Not to Be Considered a Drug

[Our Newspaper's Report] The district court continued the trial of the case of buried opium soil found in a flower bed at No. 31 Dade Lane, Linsen Middle Road, yesterday and summoned the first defendant, Pei Yuanjun's, maid He Lanjun, and his neighbor, Xu Dingguo, to testify. The statements of the defendants Pei Yuanjun (house owner), Zhou Asan (gardener), and Shi Zhaoguang (former owner) were generally that they had no prior knowledge that there were drugs hidden in the flower bed. Although Zhou Asan had discovered it once, he did not pay attention because he did not recognize the drugs. The two Cheng persons also proved that Pei Yuanjun had never trafficked drugs. The court stated that 1,058 kilograms of opium soil were found in the flower bed and sent to the Municipal Health Bureau for testing. The maximum morphine content was 0.35%, and the minimum was 0.29%. With such a large amount of drugs hidden in the house, how could they not know? Later, the defendant's defense lawyer argued that ordinary opium usually contains more than 10% morphine, and the drug found had such a small drug content that it should not be considered a drug. The house had previously been the former residence of "Morphine King" Ye Qinghe, so the batch of drugs may have been the residue after Ye extracted morphine from opium at that time. To avoid attracting attention, it was buried in the flower bed, and the defendants have no suspicion of hiding drugs. After the closing arguments, the court ordered the case to be sentenced on April 3.

### Zhabei Shooting of Young Woman: Perpetrator Arrested

[Our Newspaper's Report] A shooting occurred at No. 203 Lai'an Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, at around 11:30 PM on August 30 last year.

The other day, Criminal Division Inspector Song Yuanshan of the Huangpu Police Branch learned that the suspect Xie was hiding in the Zhabei area. He reported to Director Zhang, who ordered Chief Li to supervise Inspector Song and others to lie in ambush at the entrance of Yonghe Lane, Baochang Road. Soon after, Zhu saw the suspect arrive and was immediately arrested. During questioning at the station, he confessed to shooting Han. The reason for the shooting appeared to be that he was involved in drug trafficking and feared that she would report him, so he took this drastic measure. The firearm used was stored by a certain military officer. The branch is currently conducting a thorough investigation.

### Taiwan's Control of Books and Stationery

Private Bookstores Feel Threatened

[Our Newspaper, Taipei] Everything in Taiwan is special, everything is under control. There are no state-run bookstores in the mainland, but Taiwan has taken the lead in establishing the state-run Taiwan Bookstore, which edits and prints books and also sells stationery. Thus, books and stationery are also under control. The Governor-General's Office has issued an order to all subordinate units to purchase all books and stationery from the Taiwan Bookstore. In fact, most of the schools in Taiwan are public schools, which belong to the Governor-General's Office. Thus, all the books and stationery needed by schools throughout the province are handled by the government. In the recent spring sales, most of the elementary school textbooks adopted versions from the Taiwan Bookstore. The "Kaiming" bookstore, one of the seven joint bookstores, independently printed and sold the nationally designated Guoding edition of common textbooks with phonetic symbols, which proved to be very profitable. Other bookstores that rushed to transport the Guoding edition of textbooks from Shanghai to Taiwan were almost ignored, suffering heavy losses. According to a person in charge of a bookstore, if this abnormal state continues to exist, legitimate private bookstores will feel deeply threatened. Apart from ending their business as soon as possible and bidding farewell to the Taiwanese people with sadness, there is no other way to survive.

### Jiangsu Province Counties Self-Fund Education to Protect Schools
Gan Yunshou Strongly Opposes Bad Practices in Official Letter to Ministry

[Our Newspaper's Report] To ensure funding for national schools, Jiangsu Province counties have traditionally collected education funds as an add-on to land taxes, which are then centrally managed by the county government. Starting this year, most counties have received general orders requiring township and neighborhood chiefs to raise funds themselves, with no further subsidies provided. Gan Yunshou, an educator from the province, believes that this approach has many flaws that would impede the development of national education. He submitted a letter to the Ministry of Education, strongly criticizing the harmful effects and requesting that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instruct all counties to promptly withdraw the aforementioned general orders to safeguard education. Recently, Mr. Gan received a reply from the Ministry of Education, document number Guo Zi 15707, stating, "All documents have been reviewed. Approval is granted to forward the matter to the relevant department for investigation and action, followed by a report for verification." It is reported that the Ministry of Education did not agree to this approach beforehand.

### Students at Shanghai University Stage Strike, Presenting Two Demands

Regarding the suspension of student Jin, the university has agreed to reduce it to two weeks, but the students stated that this is still unacceptable because the two weeks coincide with the minor exam period. Therefore, they insist on being allowed to take the exams.

Under these circumstances, prices tended to loosen, and all fronts showed signs of retreat.

### Social Bureau Considers Increased Prices for Gold Jewelry Excessive, Will Discuss with Representatives Again Today

### Wool Raw Material Allocation Committee Decides Iron and Wood Looms Conversion Standard

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Wool Raw Material Allocation Committee recently held a meeting to determine the standard for allocating spindle quotas. As for the allocation method for looms, members Ge Jiezhen and Wu Shan罃 of the committee convened representatives of weaving factories, including Wang Houfu, Tong Shuangyang, and Huang Jinzhuan, at the Wool Spinning Association at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss and determine the following standards: Double-width iron-wood looms are equal to 1/2 iron loom, single-width iron-wood looms are equal to 1/4 iron loom, camel wool round looms are equal to two iron looms, camel wool flat looms are equal to one iron loom, Hebolong iron looms are equal to 1/2 iron loom, and Hebolong wood looms are equal to 1/4 iron loom.

In addition, the committee stated that the wool import quota for February to April of this year is only 1.4 million US dollars, which the industry feels is difficult to allocate. The reasons are: (1) According to the quota, only one-tenth of the raw materials needed by the industry can be met, resulting in each factory only being able to operate for four days per month. (2) Of the 1.4 million dollar quota, 255,000 dollars must be allocated to wool weaving factories, leaving only 1.145 million dollars for spinning factories. The shortage for each factory will have to be met through the black market, but the price is already twice as high as the quota import price. (3) Shanghai currently only has 700,000 pounds of raw materials, which is not enough for the industry's needs for one month. (4) For the sake of simplicity in future raw material allocation, weaving factories hope to use iron looms as the unit. All looms are equivalent to approximately 270 iron loom units. For spinning factories, the standard is 0.4 pounds for spindles, 0.5 pounds for fine yarn, 0.6 pounds for coarse yarn, and 1 pound for coarse spinning ring spindles. The committee will submit a letter to the Quota Allocation Department of the Export Control Commission requesting that the above points be followed.

### Tea Leaf Acquisition: The National Treasury Cannot Bear Profits or Losses; The Method Will Be Completely Changed; The Central Bank Plans to Consult the Executive Yuan

Tea merchants, citing export difficulties, repeatedly requested government purchases last year, which were approved by the then-President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen. Relevant authorities immediately submitted details of the acquisition to the Executive Yuan, which were also approved by President Song this year. The Central Bank immediately began handling the matter with relevant authorities. On the one hand, the Ministry of Finance was notified that the national treasury would bear the profits and losses of the acquisition. Last month, with foreign exchange loans extended, tea merchants again requested more assistance. Recently, Liu, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, convened representatives of tea merchants to discuss packing loans and export methods, and was preparing to report separately to the Executive Yuan and the Four Banks Joint Treasury for approval when a reply was received from the Ministry of Finance stating: the national treasury has no such budget and cannot bear the profits and losses of tea leaf acquisitions. The Central Bank was requested to consult the Executive Yuan for further instructions. After receiving the letter, the Central Bank considered that since the national treasury had no such budget, the original acquisition method had become invalid. In addition to consulting the Executive Yuan again, the letter from the Ministry of Finance was also notified to the tea merchants. According to the person in charge of the Central Bank: It is difficult to predict what the future method will be. However, it is believed that the government will seek other ways to remedy the export tea industry, and the Central Bank will still do its best to provide assistance. It is heard that the Central Bank plans to invite representatives of tea merchants to exchange opinions in order to report to the Executive Yuan.

### Taiwan Sugar Continues Rationing as Before

Yesterday was the date for Taiwan Sugar Corporation's rationing again. The price remained the same, and the quota remained the same. The allocation included 50% of raw sugar, 20% of "four and a half" white sugar, and 30% of "two four" coarse white sugar. The guild's market assessment remained strong. Spot prices for "two two" medium sugar white remained unchanged. Secondary double-bagged was 220,000 yuan, and single-bagged was 224,000 yuan. "Two four" coarse white rose by over 10,000 yuan, warehouse receipts rose by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, "four and a half" military white warehouse receipts rose by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, and "three and a half" military white rose by 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Peruvian fine sugar was 218,000 to 220,000 yuan, up by 10,000 yuan. The next period was 222,000 yuan. Numbered goods opened: Shantou Qing at 139,000 yuan, Shunde Qing at 133,000 yuan, Diao Qing at 130,000 yuan, Xinghua white at 200,200 to 200,000 yuan, secondary at 198,000 yuan, Xingchi at 134,000 to 140,000 yuan, with over 300 transactions.

### Silk Transactions Were Very Few

The decline in rayon prices has stopped, and yesterday's market was the same as the previous day's. 120 count Gaoshan bright yarn opened at 5,923,000 yuan, with no transactions. In the afternoon, it was bid up to 6,050,000 yuan and sold, resulting in a break-even with the previous day. 100 count matte Jianzi goods were quoted at 8,600,000 yuan. Factory silk yesterday E grade opened with more than ten loads, priced at 7,000,000 yuan. There were few transactions for zero lot raw silk. There was an order for five loads of thousand-light goods, still between 5,800,000 and 6,000,000 yuan. The silk market was quiet, prices remained the same, and the number of transactions was extremely small. The reason is that orders for autumn and winter goods have been placed and there is no outlet, while buyers are waiting and delaying due to the cold weather for summer goods, which has led to this situation.

### Light-Colored Woolen Fabrics Sell Well

Yesterday, the standard market prices for woolen fabrics in various markets remained similar to the previous days. Except for Ulster, which had a large quantity released by non-professionals, coupled with the season, which drove the market downstream, the rest were quietly stable. Light gray floral fabrics were quite short in various stores, and the trend was therefore more brisk. Various women's colored wools in red, yellow, blue, green, gray were selling well, and there was considerable demand from domestic customers. This is because their cost is lighter than men's woolen fabrics, and the profit is not much different. Now that spring is warm, it is the peak season for cheongsam and coat materials, so zero-lot and wholesale transactions are even more active. The supply of goods from incoming shipments and local factories is therefore also very abundant. Top-grade women's colored wools commonly sell for over 100,000 yuan, second-grade for 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, third-grade for 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and fourth-grade for 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

### Okinawa Surplus Supplies: The Western Medicine Portion Will Be on the Market

According to news from the pharmaceutical industry, the surplus supplies purchased by our country from Okinawa, USA, for Western medicine alone, are worth more than US$100 million, enough to supply the entire country for five years. Most of these medicines have already arrived in Shanghai, and a small portion is still being loaded. The portion that has already arrived in Shanghai will soon be on the market, and the price is quite low. The industry is currently meeting to discuss requesting the government to attach a portion of domestic Western medicine during rationing, and at the same time hoping to change the original American-made trademarks to labels of the Materials Supply Bureau, so as to avoid promoting foreign goods.

### This Year's Tea Loan Principles: Application on Site Decided

As for the total amount of tea loans and detailed loan rules, it is learned that the Four Banks Joint Treasury and the Agricultural Bank are stepping up their discussions and will announce and implement them in the short term.

### More Than a Thousand Tons of Tung Oil: Loaded for Export

[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, more than a thousand tons of tung oil have been loaded for export to the United States. It is learned that this tung oil was offered to New York a few months ago. Now that domestic and foreign prices have reached a close point, exports will be greatly reduced. This reporter interviewed extensively about the export situation of tung oil. It is generally believed that the foreign price is fixed and the domestic price has not declined. In the absence of profit for exporters, exports may not occur. However, new oil from the producing areas is about to enter the market, and the domestic price may depreciate due to the abundance of goods. It is expected that the rural goods of tung oil from Hankou and Changsha producing areas will flood the market in large quantities next month, and the price will look soft at that time. The traffic situation this year has improved a lot compared to the past. If the price in the producing areas can be reduced to within 300,000 per municipal load at this time, exports can be increased this year. Yesterday, the spot price opened at 310,000 yuan per municipal load on the general market, 420,000 yuan including barrel, and 400,000 yuan for door sales. The arrival of fixed quantity goods has become rare. A small amount of Xihong has arrived in succession, and few customers are shipping to Shanghai for sale. The goods that have been shipped are all purchased by merchants from the producing areas and shipped to Shanghai.

### Cement Industry Trade Association: Held the First Board Meeting; Yan Huiqing and Others Elected as Managing Directors

[Reported by this newspaper] The National Cement Industry Trade Association held its first board meeting at 3 pm yesterday. All 21 directors attended, and all supervisors were also present. Yan Huiqing was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, and managing directors were elected by mutual vote. As a result, Yan Huiqing, Liu Hongsheng, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Jun, and Chen Fanyou were elected. Yan Huiqing was also elected as the chairman of the board. A total of ten proposals were discussed:

(1) The association's work program was adopted. The main points are: (A) regarding production, (B) regarding transportation, (C) regarding technology, (D) regarding research. (2) The association's budget for the 36th year was discussed and approved, and will be submitted for ratification at the next members' meeting. (3) The organizational rules of the association's offices (in Nanjing) and administrative offices (one in Shanghai) were discussed and approved. (4) The association's detailed rules of procedure were discussed and approved. (5) It was decided that the location of the association's administrative office should be limited to one place in Shanghai for the time being. (6) Chen Hanqing was hired as the general manager, and Xi Zhengxiu as the deputy general manager. (7) A request will be submitted to the competent authorities for registration and issuance of seals.

(8) During the War of Resistance, the cement industry suffered heavy losses. It is proposed that the association compile detailed statistics of the losses of various factories and submit them to the government to negotiate the dismantling of Japanese factory equipment for compensation to facilitate recovery. According to news from various sources, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan approved ten types of Japanese industries to be dismantled for compensation to China, but cement industry was the only one missing. According to investigation, the Japanese cement industry was quite developed before the war. In addition to half of the total production being used for its own use, the remaining half was available for export. Therefore, based on this investigation, negotiations will be conducted to dismantle Japanese factory equipment for compensation. (9) The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Standards Committee sent a copy of the cement standards it had formulated, instructing the association to inform its members to adopt it. It was resolved to organize a review committee, and Wang Songtao, Xu Zongdong, Yu Zongyu, Chen Fanyou, and Lu Zongxian were appointed as members. Once the review is completed, it will be submitted to the Ministry for approval.

(10) Qixin Yanghui Company, North China Cement Company, etc., requested negotiations to expand the quota for imported burlap bags and to open up the import of gypsum paper bags. It was resolved to authorize the general manager and deputy general manager to handle the matter. According to the note, the quota for burlap bags from February to April this year is only US$1.25 million. This amount can purchase 1.5 million burlap bags. If purchasing cement bags holding 85 kilograms, only 2.27 million bags can be obtained. All imported burlap bags can only hold 190,000 tons of cement, and only 63,000 tons of cement can be filled per month. Moreover, considering the monthly needs of factories such as Qixin, North China, Jiuda, and Yongli in North China alone, 250,000 burlap bags are needed. Therefore, the total burlap bag quota is not enough to meet the needs of North China alone. Cement paper bags cannot be manufactured domestically at present. Gypsum is also one of the main raw materials for cement, accounting for 3% of the total raw material amount, and all of it needs to be supplied from overseas. Therefore, it is urgent to find ways to relax its import quota, otherwise cement production will be unable to continue.

### Yarn Market Turns Downward

Yesterday, the yarn market turned downward, and customer sales were as quiet as stagnant water, without any movement. Those who were forced to sell goods allocated by Fangjian the previous day due to tight finances lowered prices to seek sales, causing the price of 20-count yarn to fall by 50,000 to 100,000, and people's hearts turned mediocre as a result. The trend is still a revolving situation.

### Small Denomination Banknotes: Central Bank Recalls and Destroys

Since the Central Bank issued 5,000 yuan and 250 yuan and 500 yuan customs gold notes, banknotes with numbers such as one, five, ten, and fifty yuan, although not prohibited by the Central Bank, are no longer circulating in the market. In order to maintain the credibility of the currency, the Central Bank specially ordered its branches throughout the country and requested the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Postal Savings Bureau, and the China Trust Bureau to recall them on its behalf. Among them, the branches of the Farmers Bank of China and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are widely established in various places, so the effect is quite large. In order to avoid spending a lot of freight, the bank sealed the small denomination banknotes received in various places on the spot, and periodically invited the heads of local administrative agencies, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Audit Department of the Bank's Issuance Bureau to send personnel to jointly burn them. If residents in various places still hold small denomination banknotes, they can still exchange them at the local four banks and two bureaus.

### New York Shanghai Bristles Decline Again: Few Exports, Weak Transactions

[Reported by this newspaper] The price of pig bristles has declined, and the price of New York Shanghai bristles has fallen from US$2 per pound to US$1.90 again, and the price of Sichuan bristles has further softened. Han bristles are still at a price of 3.50 yuan. Few transactions were opened in the market yesterday, and exports have been extremely rare recently.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Demerara, managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., left Shanghai for the United States yesterday morning, loaded with more than 1,000 boxes of pig bristles, more than 600 boxes of wool, 38 pieces of goatskin, and about 600 boxes of tea, which were shipped to New York. Jiangjian Wheel returned to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday, carrying a large number of cotton and tobacco leaves, more than 2,500 pieces of cotton, and more than 3,800 pieces of tobacco leaves.

### Timber Transactions Were Sluggish

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the prices of foreign pine, sawn squares, and plywood remained at the original price levels. Actual sales were sparse. Although cedar strips and floorings were soft, the market atmosphere has gradually loosened due to increased shipping costs and increased labor costs in Fujian.

### Shenyang Grain Prices Rise

[Reported from Shenyang on the 27th by this newspaper] Grain prices in Shenyang have been rising continuously recently. Rice has risen from 90 yuan of circulation coupons per catty to 130 yuan, sorghum rice is 6,500 yuan, flour is 280 yuan per catty, beef is 280 yuan per catty, and pork is 220 yuan per catty.

### A Discussion of Measles

— Xie Shou

(1) Regarding the occurrence of measles

Why does measles occur? Probably because a filterable ultramicroscopic organism is causing trouble. Such ultramicroscopic organisms exist in the patient's blood; and of course, they also exist in tears, nasal mucus, and phlegm, so they are easily transmitted directly to others through coughing and sneezing.

Measles mostly occurs in late autumn and winter, and in spring, almost every year. However, it can be a few years before it becomes a large-scale epidemic; sometimes every two or three years, sometimes every five or six years. This is because when there is a large epidemic one year, almost all susceptible residents are infected and acquire a certain immunity. Therefore, after a large epidemic, there are several years of calm. During these years of calm, newborn children, of course, have not yet been infected with measles, or when immunity disappears for some reason, a second large-scale epidemic of measles is triggered.

Infants are less likely to be infected, because infants often lie in bedding and have few opportunities to contact children outside. Furthermore, breastfed infants can obtain maternal antibodies from breast milk, which provides some immunity. Therefore, the prognosis of measles infection is often poor in artificially fed infants.

The spread of measles mostly originates in families or among children outdoors. The most important place is schools, because measles patients, even in the incubation period (that is, after measles has been infected, but has not yet been detected, medically called the incubation period), although there are no symptoms on the surface, already have the ability to infect others and can transmit it to others.

Adults rarely develop measles, because most have already developed it in childhood, and after it has occurred, they acquire a certain immunity.

(2) Symptoms of Measles

Measles can be divided into four stages based on its course: the first stage is the incubation period; it lasts about ten days, and the child usually has no symptoms. The second stage is called the prodromal period: a sudden high fever of 39 to 40 degrees Celsius occurs, lasting about one day, and then drops the next morning. At the same time, there is nasal mucus, sneezing, red eyes, tearing, coughing, headache, loss of appetite, etc., like a state of a cold, lasting about three or four days. During this period, there is also early mucosal rash, that is, round, dark red spots appear in the mouth, pharynx, soft palate, etc. The most important thing for diagnosis is the appearance of bluish-white, slightly raised spots on the buccal mucosa opposite the molars, called Koplik's spots. The third stage is called the rash period: that is, the body temperature suddenly rises again, even higher than the first fever, sometimes reaching above 40 degrees Celsius. Then, light red papules begin to appear on the face, shaped like circles or polygons, sometimes merging with each other, but there must be healthy skin between the rashes. Such rashes spread rapidly from the face to the upper part of the trunk, upper arms, lower part of the trunk, upper legs, forearms, hands, lower legs, and feet, covering the whole body. Parents are happy when they see that the child's soles already have a rash. At this time, nasal mucus and tears increase significantly, and coughing is also very severe. In addition, there are headaches, thirst, loss of appetite, and sometimes even delirium, convulsions, etc. After the rash has spread all over the body, it gradually subsides. The entire rash period lasts about four or five days. The fourth stage: the skin rash gradually fades, the epithelium flakes off, and various mucous membrane inflammation symptoms gradually subside, which is called the recovery period.

(3) The Terror of Measles

Measles can be said to be an easy disease, because everyone has to go through it, and it is not seen that everyone loses their lives. However, according to statistics from various countries, among 10,000 children, the number of deaths due to measles is 1.5 in Japan; 11.4 in England; 6.8 in Germany; 5.3 in Switzerland; 30.4 in the Soviet Union; and 6.7 in Italy. Our country does not yet have accurate statistics. When we inquire about medical history in clinical practice, we know that there are indeed many children who die from measles.

Speaking of measles itself, if the course is benign, there is nothing to be afraid of, that is, several variant types; such as papular measles, confluent measles, varicella-like measles, and hemorrhagic measles, are not a big deal. Only one type called black measles, which occurs in children with hemorrhagic diathesis, has a poor course.

### New Position for Sleeping

— Wang Wangren

The nature of most animals is that they never lie flat until they die. Whether a person is sick or healthy, lying flat on their back all day long for too long is most inappropriate. If a person has a local illness that requires surgery, and surgery is performed, it is a mistake to allow them to lie flat. There are many disadvantages. First, it is easy to cause inflammation of the lungs. Second, it may even lead to lung lobe folding, which is bad for breathing. The third and most dangerous item is "blood clotting (thrombosis)" in the legs, which is not only the "cause" of sudden leg swelling, but can also cause blood clots "emboli" to enter the pulmonary artery, suddenly stopping breathing and resulting in loss of life. Pregnant women who are about to give birth lose blood due to childbirth, which is slightly similar to the bodies of those who have just undergone surgery. It is quite dangerous within ten days after delivery.

In Europe, it is customary to get out of bed nine days after delivery. However, according to the new theory, it is said that one can sit up and rest five days later. This is because, in addition to the above-mentioned three dangers, sleeping for too long can easily lead to muscle malnutrition and "atrophy," and the fourth type of disease is stiff limbs due to inactivity.

If people move more, blood is easier to circulate and muscles get more nutrition. Now, American Air Force hospitals treat wounded soldiers who cannot get out of bed by making them do leg exercises. There is more than one way to exercise. Generally, they make them move interactively like riding a bicycle forward.

At the same time, there is another way to prevent "blood clotting," which is to make the bed they sleep on higher at the foot and slightly lower on the side near the head, making it tilted at a 45-degree angle. This method helps lung breathing and also prevents inflammation of the lungs. New-style hospitals in various countries have generally understood this and have gradually changed to placing this type of inclined bed.

### Hemorrhoids

— Su Fu

Most hemorrhoid patients, in addition to suffering during bowel movements, most commonly have bloody stools. Yes! The Western name for hemorrhoids is Hemorrhoid - Hemo. The meaning of this word is related to blood. Originally, there are many blood vessels around the anus. These small blood vessels are interconnected and spread all over. Once the exit is blocked, they accumulate blood. This small hoarder accumulates more and more, and as a result, it becomes towering and swollen. Once it encounters external force, when the stool is expelled, the blood breaks out. This accumulates day by day, of course causing anemia. A trickle of water can become a river. Although it is a small hidden disease, the consequences are indeed quite serious.

Originally, blood should flow very smoothly, but many people with habitual constipation have hard stools that accumulate in the rectum, pressing on the blood vessels near the anus. During bowel movements, the person strains forcefully, and the blood vessels become even more swollen. Cause and effect cycle, hemorrhoids are caused by constipation, and hemorrhoids cause even more constipation, so the prevention of hemorrhoids! The first is to make bowel movements smooth, which is the root of the problem.

Some people say that people who drink alcohol are very likely to develop hemorrhoids. In fact, this is indeed the case. People who drink alcohol are prone to liver disease. The blood vessels in the liver are medically called the portal vein, and the blood vessels near the anus are connected to the portal vein. After liver disease, the circulation of the portal vein will be hindered, indirectly affecting the circulation of blood near the anus, of course creating opportunities for blood accumulation, leading to the source of hemorrhoids.

When a woman is pregnant, her belly contains a new life, which blocks the blood flow in the lower part of the mother's body, so there is swelling of the feet, etc. The blood vessels near the anus are neighbors, so they also accompany the last seat. At the time of childbirth, it is like ten thousand horses galloping, using all their strength to squeeze the child out. All the strength is downward. On the one hand, the blood flow is already poor, and on the other hand, this squeeze makes the blood vessels near the anus even more successful in selling their belly. So during childbirth, a small head sticks out of the vagina above the anus, and a mass of things is also squeezed out of the anus. When he comes, he goes downstream, but when he leaves, it is not easy to invite him back. So if our mother has hemorrhoids, it is really the son's fault. When we think of our mother's hemorrhoids, we should do our filial duty even more.

Many cultural workers spend most of their time sitting. And so on, many gamblers are addicted to the mahjong table all day long, lack exercise, and blood flow is therefore impeded, accumulating near the anus, which is also prone to hemorrhoids, so we must move often, which is not unrelated.

As for external hemorrhoids and internal hemorrhoids, this is just a difference in the location where they grow, and we don't need to worry too much about it.

Because hemorrhoids have unspeakable discomfort and hidden pain, most people first think of applying some medicine. In the case of internal hemorrhoids, they get some injections locally, hoping to eliminate themselves, but perhaps they see a slight effect, or perhaps they recur. Patients hope that one dose will cure them and the disease will be cured by medicine, but doctors are powerless. In the end, most people undergo surgery. The results of surgery may recur. After recurrence, of course, they blame the previous doctor's bad work and ask a second doctor to treat them. In fact, it's ridiculous. The patient continues to revel, plays mahjong day and night, and is still constipated. They continue to give birth without solving the root cause, so of course they will not get better. Of course, there is no way to avoid childbirth, only obstetricians. Be careful temporarily. But other kinds of lifestyle improvements and good habits are not too difficult. Turning back is the shore.

In addition to hemorrhoids, there are many other diseases near the anus that cannot be lumped together, such as anal fissures, which can also cause large amounts of bleeding, and perianal inflammation is even more painful. There is also a large piece of rectal prolapse that protrudes. Anal fistulas, which we call "feces-stealing rats" in the countryside, often discharge pus. Although each has its own cause, it is not unrelated to smooth bowel movements and cleanliness near the anus. Therefore, people with hemorrhoids, I hope you wash your anus with water after each bowel movement. Drink more water, eat more fruits and vegetables, exercise more, and even use glycerin suppositories or enemas. In short, it is most important to make bowel movements smooth every day.

Hemorrhoids, this is a common name, the scientific name is hemorrhoidal nodules or hemorrhoids.

### Medical Correspondence

Replies to Mr. Zhang Xin Xinwu and Mr. Li Qifan

(1)  Popularly, masturbation is called illegally releasing semen, but in fact, nocturnal emission is also a type of illegal semen release. Although one is intentional and the other unintentional, the illness is the same. Therefore, young people who masturbate are most prone to nocturnal emission. And those who want to cure nocturnal emission should regard completely abstaining from masturbation as the only way.

(2)  Nocturnal emission and neurasthenia are mutually causal: excessive nocturnal emission can lead to neurasthenia, and neurasthenia can also lead to nocturnal emission. Those who suffer from nocturnal emission without masturbating are mostly caused by neurasthenia. Tranquilizers such as potassium bromide and sodium bromide can calm oversensitive nerves and are symptomatic drugs for neurasthenia; therefore, they can also be used to treat nocturnal emission.

(3)  Frequent ejaculation is not necessarily a fatal disease, and it is even less of a problem for development; therefore, patients do not need to be overly pessimistic. On the one hand, it is appropriate to seek medical advice; on the other hand, it is even more important to strive to boost one's spirit. If one's spirit is invigorated and one's will is firm, nocturnal emission can be cured even without medication.

(4)  In addition, patients with diabetes, spinal tuberculosis, and prostatitis may also occasionally experience nocturnal emission. But this is a minority; they should be diagnosed and treated by specialists. Moreover, in addition to nocturnal emission, there should be other symptoms that reveal the original disease. Therefore, it is easy to distinguish from the nocturnal emission suffered by ordinary people, so I will not go into detail here. (Ma Dian)

### Sichuan Flavor

— Yan Zhewu

(1) First Impression

Boating through the Three Gorges, steep cliffs and shallow shoals, the peaks turn and the road winds, orange groves along the mountain, dots of vermilion red, fragrance of rind everywhere, the first impression of entering Sichuan is the red oranges and mandarins in winter and the white-turbaned men of Sichuan! There is also a record of red oranges and mandarins in the Wonders of Ancient and Modern Times, as if those entering Shu once cited it as a way to achieve proper governance, but I never thought that after some years, West Shu would also have large orange groves! I spent eight years in Sichuan, and every winter I bought piles of oranges and mandarins to keep at home, sometimes roasting them to eat, and sometimes specially boiling them into "orange jam". In the first year I entered Sichuan, I was almost addicted to eating oranges and mandarins! Later, I stayed briefly in Jiang'an, and visited the orange groves! It was easy to live in Beibei, and I bought them by the hundreds on orange boats on the Jialing River, and even ran into the orange groves to pick them myself. The joy of this still feels fresh today! It is said that Sichuan's fruits such as oranges, mandarins, pomelos, and watermelons were all transplanted from other provinces, especially those brought to Sichuan by migrants from Guangdong.

The white turban is the "mourning cloth" brought by the people of the Lower Yangtze, said to be originally in mourning for Zhuge Wuhou. However, mountain mists are everywhere in Sichuan, which can easily lead to headaches, so people mostly wrap their heads in white cloth as a substitute for hats, which is also a reason.

This white turban was banned during the Anti-Japanese War because of enemy air raids, but it was difficult to change because of years of customs, so protection personnel often shouted "take off the white turban!"

Accompanying the white turban is a kind of "warming basket", just like the "fire pot" of the Lower Yangtze, which is used to warm hands and feet. Those using fire often have a "white turban" tied on their heads, a "warming basket" in their hands, and another hand taking a "bamboo joint" made of tobacco pipe, leisurely smoking tobacco leaves, giving a unique leisurely flavor!

(2) Unique Language Interests

The language of Sichuan is quite refined, often speaking in prose! But there are also those who use swearing as a verbal tic! For example, "ge (auxiliary word) guier" "gou (auxiliary word) laozi", in addition to special grammatical organization such as "ying shi" "yao de" "yao bu de". The character "de" is often read as "Dai"! "What" is said as "sangzi", "　zi."

There are even a few words whose meanings are fundamentally different from those of the Lower Yangtze: for example, "ba men shuan qi" (bolt the door), you can't read it like that, you must change it to say "ba men cha dao" (insert the door bolt)! On the contrary, "tie people up" must be changed to say "ba ta shuan (read as shuan) qi"! Therefore, Sichuan's prisoners are tied up with ropes with their arms and hands tied behind their backs, which is the meaning of "shuan".

When we first arrived in Chengdu, Brother Yang Cunbin once asked a farmer from Xindu County who came to help perform before the opening of "Rear Defense" for a "wooden mallet", saying: "Bring me that hammer!" Some people laughed there, and I asked them: "What are you laughing at?" They said: "Hammer" in Sichuan means the male genitals! I suddenly realized, told Cunbin, and we laughed at each other.

(3) Between Mountains and Rivers

Sichuan is mountainous on all sides, so there are many "mountain cities"; the characteristics of mountain cities are mostly "slopes", mostly "steps" "uphill" "downhill", often a mountain city is divided into "upper city" "middle city" "lower city". There are houses on top of houses, and people on top of people, and often the bungalows are along the street, and underground along the steps, there may even be one or two floors underground! So looking at the bungalows on that street surface, they are actually on the third floor! Since there are many slopes and steps, walking up and down, the legs are quite suffering, often using sedan chairs instead. Sichuan's sedan chairs mostly have short front poles and long rear poles, so you are not afraid of being steep when going downhill, so that the sedan chair sitter does not fall, and when going uphill, the sedan chair carriers behind push against the long poles to make the sedan chair carriers in front move forward, and the sedan chair sitters can often lie on their backs with their feet facing the sky! More convenient and elastic than sedan chairs are sliding stretchers (some people write it as raft stretchers). The seat is made of bamboo strips tied together in rows, which can hold the buttocks of the person sitting, and the person can lie horizontally on their back with their feet on another bamboo strip. Long-distance travelers often add quilts, cushions and lie down, but sometimes when Sichuan people die, those who cannot afford to buy coffins to bury them also use bamboo mats to wrap them up and put them on sliding stretchers to be carried away, dig a pit and bury them! After entering Sichuan, arriving in Wanxian, the pier is a stone slope of two hundred and dozens of steps, enough to climb up! Outsiders who come for the first time are quite unaccustomed! Ordinary people living in Chongqing do not go out without climbing slopes and walking steps! For those with heart disease, this is a "taboo" thing!

I once traveled alone to Mount Emei, which is full of steep slopes. Each level has one hundred steps, and each stone surface is only five or six inches wide. Sometimes there is moss on it, and if you don't step carefully, you can easily fall off the mountain cliff, which is frightening! Therefore, those slopes are named "Guangxin Slope" "Zuantian Slope", etc., which make people's heads ache just by hearing the names!

High mountains must have large water. The water flow in Sichuan is turbulent, with waterfalls running rampant, and flash floods occur occasionally, often flooding. There are "tan", "tuo", and "bei" near the water. "Tan" are mostly sand and stones standing in the heart of the river, which are fully exposed when the water is shallow, so they are also called "shallow beaches". Shallow beaches are the most difficult to cross, the water flow is dangerous, and "crossing the beach" is the most intense moment for boatmen to fight with nature with their lives. There are trackers who pull the boat, and the back-pullers are always in a string. I lived on the banks of the Jialing River for four years, and I often heard cries for help in the middle of the night in spring, summer, autumn and winter! On days of heavy water, floating corpses passed by, and overturned boats sent paddles floating, screams and cries, which often made people tremble. This natural threat often adds a shadow to people's lives!

My home is in "Zhangjia Tuo", and friends have also lived in "Tangjia Tuo", "Lijia 　"! This word "tuo" is also unique to Sichuan, it represents a peninsula village near the water. It is a new word only found in Sichuan. Similarly, my home is in Beibei, and the meaning of the word "bei" is probably a stone beach across the heart of the river. "Beibei" is named after the "bei" stone that obstructs the Jialing River flow between Chaoyang Town and Dongyang Town Huangtong Town on the opposite bank. This word "bei" also seems to be rarely seen elsewhere.

(4) Strange Taste Mouth!

Entering Kui Gate, tasting Sichuan flavors, from eating, seeing "sea pepper" and "spicy oil" everywhere, one can get a glimpse of the preferences of Sichuan people's spleen and stomach! Some people say that Sichuan has a lot of fog and heavy humidity, and people eat more spicy food to relieve miasma and maintain health, which is considered reasonable. In Chongqing, we are used to eating carp braised with "White Rose" bean paste and chili, as well as steamed pork with rice flour, without wine, without scallions and garlic, just mixed with chili to remove all fishy smell! The hot pot of "Hot Pot Tripe" is like the mutton hot pot in Beijing. Its basic original soup contains the three flavors of "sour", "spicy", and "numb". Sour is vinegar, spicy is sea pepper, and numb is Sichuan pepper. Therefore, those who eat tripe hot pot are all sweating profusely from the spiciness. In addition, Chengdu's "Wu's Wonton" and "Gugu Banquet" are even more famous places to eat that pay attention to seasoning. In Xufu, I have eaten "Bangbang Chicken", also known as "Strange Flavor Chicken". In fact, it is just chicken legs and chicken meat, with chili, sugar, salt, sauce, sesame paste, scallions and other seasonings!

"Stir-fried hands" are "wonton"! The exquisite ones use real chicken soup, with little oil, good ingredients, and fresh taste. Some people say that rat meat should also be added.

Chengdu is the most particular place for "snacks" in Sichuan. There are so-called "Drunk and Never Return Small Wine Shop" and other store names everywhere, cheap and beautiful! Sichuan rice is sold by the bowl, and one bowl is called a "mao er (hat?) tou" (maybe it's a homophone), I don't know how this name originated!

"Pickled vegetables" and "preserved mustard tuber" are unique products of Sichuan. The method is actually very simple, but the taste is delicious.

Among the vegetarian dishes, there is a kind of "konjac". At first, I thought it was fake "braised eel", but later I learned that it is a gelatinous substance, made by mixing the juice extracted from a plant with cooked water! It is said to be rich in nutrients.

"Fish-flavored shredded pork", "twice-cooked pork", and "stir-fried cured pork" are my favorite Sichuan dishes! Sichuan people love to drink, and there are many ways to persuade people to drink, there is the so-called art of "composing wine". People who have lived in Sichuan often have to socialize with local "gentry and grain officials", and they are inevitably forced to "break the rule" and cannot escape the joke of "being drunk". There are people in Sichuan who can drink and have nicknames such as "drunk for seven days", "drunk and never wake up", "can't wake up", and "wine jar", which shows the "sea" volume of alcohol!

White fungus, summer worm winter grass and other unique tonics in Sichuan, I am not interested in, so I have no connection with them!

### Spring Birds

— Zhang Shuqi

### Loneliness

— Si Xiu

The night is deep.

On the desk, the wick of the oil lamp reveals a dim red spark; the faint light shines on the gray mud wall, infinitely gloomy. The slightly swaying and swinging lamp flame seems to be a tired shadow smiling insidiously. The winter sky - a thick lead gray sky - unfolds again before my eyes.

I have returned from a distant dream, a dream woven from strands of affection; lying on a narrow and hard bed, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep again. Quietly, I listen: to the decadent ancient city's nighttime groans, to the harsh wind's unbridled roar, to the silent sighs and resentment of the stars drowned by the darkness of night...

The rustling cold wind, as if a polite guest, knocks frequently on the dilapidated window sill; a heavy and peaceful heart stirs up a layer of ripples, and the waves of emotion are surging.

Silently, let the insomnia-induced emotions take over.

Suddenly, I feel: as if outside the window is an boundless, azure and bright sky; on the vast border, a few wisps of light clouds, like dots, flutter lightly...

A force of sincerity is pulling me, an alluring, simple and beautiful smiling face is beckoning.

So, I put on my thin clothes, gently push open the door, and walk into the depths of the night.

The alley is hazy with the darkness of night. A long period of years has trained my night eyes with the smoke of war, distinguishing the puddles scattered on the ground. At first, I feel it difficult, a little hesitant; but soon I get used to it.

After a long journey, suddenly a series of light laughter comes, that laughter is filled with the happiness and warmth of true feelings, and those smiling faces are so admired and blessed.

A current of passionate surge rolls on the quiet earth of the night, towards the depths of people's hearts.

Gradually, I feel the warmth, as if that current of passionate surge pours into my heart, filling the flow of my life. However, it is not long before I feel that these are just fleeting clouds in the sky, in my soul...

The dry heart field still has not lubricated the rusted heart door, my heart door is ultimately tightly closed.

Uncontrollably, I raised my head. The azure sky has been painted dark by the god of night, and not a single star is showing its face, twinkling with faint light in the sky. This gray and desolate sky is just like the hidden core of my heart.

A gust of cold wind wanders lonely across the night's fields.

### Yan Liu Lyrics

— A Long

Yan Shu, with outstanding talent, loved poetry and lyrics, and wrote the Pearl Jade Lyrics. He once wrote a song called Huan Xi Sha, with the lines "A new tune with a glass of wine, The weather last year at the old pavilion, When will the setting sun return? There's nothing to be done as the flowers fall..." At this point, he couldn't continue, and Shu was sad for a long time. Later, he passed Yangzhou because of something, and a man named Wang Qi continued with the two lines "It seems like I've seen the swallows return, Wandering alone in the small garden's fragrant path", and thus Huan Xi Sha was completed. Shu was overjoyed, and hailed the good lines endlessly, and then appointed Qi as the prefect, and for a time the world passed it on as a good story.

### Deep Alley

— Lin Cheng

Deep alley

A few drops of tinkling fall;

The fortune teller sighs,

The sighing person hopes for something to pawn.

Playing with destiny and

Being played by destiny;

Life and dream

Originally the same!

The sleeping one is mumbling;

The awake one is groping.

Just like a deep alley,

Wearing a gray dress,

Shining a light,

Thinking about the sun...

### Melancholy Grass

— Lü Zhuang

Purple melancholic narcissus decorates the desk
Exquisite flowers like paper umbrellas
I receive the shade and quietness, like smoke like a dream
Let the bees of thought fly around
On the weak edge, tomorrow, the flowers will wither and the leaves will wither
I will also be buried in that cup of mud
Will another kind of color be changed on the desk?
The second person seeing the scenery has the same state of mind

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 206

— Ye Jingfeng

We were about to hear how He Jian was going to reply to Pingzi, but there was no voice coming, but we clearly heard the sound of rubbing a lighter, presumably He Jian was "fueling up"; after a while, the transmitter made a rhythmic clicking sound, and I could imagine that He Jian must be behind his hands, pacing back and forth in the room. This was his habit of using his mind when the problem was serious. We waited quietly for a while before we heard the footsteps suddenly stop:

"Okay," He Jian's voice, "Definitely going... but I have to say goodbye to a friend... do you agree?... "

"That's for sure... but I also have a request..." Pingzi seemed to be smiling

"What is it?"

"Before leaving, I would like to ask Big Brother to introduce me to your esteemed friends; Yue Jun, and that little one... what's her name? She's so beautiful! I feel ashamed. And another one, is that her younger brother? Such terrifying eyes, like golden light shooting out... "

"As for the introduction, I agree very much. Especially the leader of the general team here... but I have to ask for the consent of a few of them first... if they agree, I would like to spend thirty minutes holding a small banquet. This is to repay the hospitality of the leader of the general team here... "

"That's even better... I don't know if they are willing to see a monster like me?"

"I'll make a phone call to try." He Jian said this.

As before, as soon as W Jun heard that He Jian was going to make a phone call, he immediately stopped the "transmitter" and closed the drawer.

In the phone call, W Jun will meet He Jian in ten minutes. I know W Jun's intention; because there are still a few procedures here that must be arranged. The first important arrangement is that we must disperse a little and change the tense mood after we have heard this great news. This is an important psychological arrangement. In addition, W Jun must also ask for our consent, who is willing to see Pingzi, who is not willing to see Pingzi, and then W Jun will arrange. Furthermore, W Jun must ask us to discuss in these few minutes the secret of everyone hearing this "secret of eight"; who tells He Jian, or temporarily does not explain it to him. But there must be a consistent attitude, so as not to cause him to be stimulated. At the same time, I also want to ask Mr. Dai for instructions on what action we should take on this information.

Sure enough, as soon as W Jun put down the phone, he explained to Yaoqun and me the few points that I had guessed. Our small group meeting was only four or five minutes and was over. The most important resolution was that I personally would explain to He Jian in advance the fact that he had listened to his conversation with Pingzi. This is a preparatory action; because Mr. Dai hopes to understand Pingzi's work steps, and is willing to do his best to cooperate with each other to destroy this "eight" plan.

As soon as this small group discussion was learned, I suddenly noticed that Yaoqun's attitude was somewhat different.

"Team leader, if you allow it, I have to go too!" Yaoqun hesitated for a moment, and said to W Jun.

"Huh", W Jun was stunned. This is probably also somewhat aware of Yaoqun's attitude, suddenly changed, unable to grasp her sudden motivation for a while.

Seeing that W Jun was stunned, Yaoqun immediately felt that her attitude had changed too quickly, and seemed to be a bit of a common routine for children, and was a bit lacking in generosity, so she quickly stated:

"It's still the plan to go to Shanxi... I predict that Mr. Gu and their work in the south may not be able to succeed satisfactorily, and this battle will have to be fought... A large part of the National Army is preparing to go west, so I want to ask you to send me to Shanxi according to the original plan... it's good to do something".

At this time, I saw that Yaoqun's spirit was very high; looking at her expression and hearing her words, I knew that a kind of inexplicable illusion had arisen in her subconscious, and I was afraid that even she herself did not know it. In simple words; she, a woman's competitive psychology, has already taken control of her entire reason.

"Oh! W Jun immediately understood everything; "Okay, very good, definitely do it according to the original plan, now please start preparing."

Finally, I saw Mr. Dai also nodding there, indicating his approval. (End of the seventh meaning)

### Art and Literary Circle

Cultural figures currently living in Taiwan include Xu Shoushang, Li Helin, Li Lie-wen, Tai Jingnong, Li Jiye, Ou Tansheng, etc., mostly working in the Provincial Translation Bureau, newspapers, and Taiwan University.

Among the Shanghai literary publications sold in Peiping, there are "Literary Autumn Forest", "Literary Renaissance", "Literary Tide", etc. In addition, soft publications such as "Teahouse Talk", "West Point", and "Happiness" sell extremely well. Among the literary publications, according to statistics, "Literary Autumn Forest" sells about 140 to 180 copies indefinitely, "Literary Renaissance" sells 50 to 60 copies, and "Literary Tide" is sold by the Peiping Zhengzhong Bookstore, so the number of basic subscribers is high, and retail sales are not smooth.

Although Peiping is a large cultural city, literary publications have stagnated. "Literary Times" has not been seen since its sixth issue in December last year, and it is thought to have ended its life. "Literature and Life", edited by the Literary Association, is also often out of date, and the content is also very trivial. And the "Modern Literary Record" co-edited by Shen Congwen, Zhu Guangqian, Yang Zhensheng, Feng Zhi, Xu Ying, etc., published its first collection in December last year, and the second collection is also difficult to produce, I am afraid that the future is not optimistic.

Novelist Wang Xiyan still lives in Fuzhou. Recently, in response to the invitation of his Shanghai friend Fan Quan, he has begun writing a 200,000-word novel "The Dream Seeker".

Former principal of the Municipal Experimental Drama School, Xian Zhongyi, has returned to Suzhou after resigning from his school duties.

### Questioning the "Kuang Chung" Charity Sale

— A Newspaper Reader

The words "Kuang Lu" seem quite familiar to me. I recall before the War of Resistance, I once received training at Mount Lu. During the war, after the fall of Wuhan, I temporarily took refuge in Luling. Therefore, the words "Kuang Lu" are truly indelible in my mind. Whenever I read the newspaper, books, or graded papers, I always paid close attention whenever I encountered the words "Kuang Lu."

This morning, while reading the Shen Bao, I saw an education news item stating that "Kuang Lu" Middle School in this city was holding a charity sale to build school buildings. At noon, while visiting a friend, I also saw an invitation for Kuang Lu Middle School's 30th Anniversary Education Fundraiser, which included a raffle charity sale. Upon carefully reading the distinguished names on the invitation, all were contemporary social figures and education officials, making me even more excited. Because "Kuang Lu" has a connection with me, and now "Kuang Lu" Middle School is raising education funds, why not help "Kuang Lu's" righteous cause? So, I took the Kuang Chung invitation and hurried home to discuss it with my wife, intending to pawn one of her ornaments to support the Kuang Chung charity effort. Initially, my wife gladly agreed, but after carefully considering it, it seemed questionable. Looking at the Kuang Chung invitation again, it stated that it was for the 30th anniversary, proving that the school has a 30-year history. However, my wife and I have lived in Shanghai for 20 years and have been involved in the Shanghai education sector for over a decade, yet we seem to have never heard of this Kuang Lu Middle School in this city that has been around for decades. Fearing I was forgetful, I inquired with friends, but none knew when the school was founded. Furthermore, I checked the list of public and private middle schools in the Municipal Education Bureau's educational weekly, but found nothing. This is the first point of doubt. Furthermore, I reviewed the names of the "Kuang Chung" Education Fund Committee, and the last signature was Wang Guanmou. I recall seeing in the local news section of the Qianhua News a report that a certain Wang Guanmou, who claimed to be a National Assembly representative, forged seals and documents and fraudulently obtained a large industrial and commercial loan under the name of a certain factory. Because the crime occurred during the amnesty period, the court refused to accept the case. This is the second point of doubt. I remember that the name "Kuang Lu" was associated with a "Kuang Lu Elementary School" in the Jiangxi Guild Hall in the southern part of the city before the war, which seems to have a connection with "Kuang Lu." Chang Le Road in this city has a "Jiangxi Middle School," and before the war, there was a Jiangxi Vocational High School (note: during the War of Resistance, the Jiangxi Vocational High School had a school building on Nanshi Railway Station Road, which was demolished by the Japanese invaders, resulting in significant losses). This is the third point of doubt.

Now, the Kuang Lu Middle School 30th Anniversary Education Fund Committee is widely distributing invitations, each with a charity raffle ticket, stating that each ticket costs 400,000 national currency. Based on the huge numbers on the ticket, one can imagine the large amount of money to be raised. I am afraid that some scoundrels are deceiving local officials and social figures to raise money through this scheme. As a newspaper reader, I have the following questions:

(1) Who are the school board members of Kuang Lu Middle School? Who is the principal? When was it approved for establishment?

(2) Where was the pre-war school building of Kuang Lu Middle School located in this city? Where is it located now? How many classes are there? How many students are there?

(3) Who was the original founder of Kuang Lu Middle School? Is it public or private?

(4) How many students have graduated from Kuang Lu Middle School over the years? Who is in charge of the Kuang Lu Middle School alumni association?

I request that the Kuang Lu Middle School Education Fund Committee publicly answer the above questions to dispel doubts and benefit the righteous cause.

### Worthless

— Chen Dexin

Wang Fengxi, a primary school student in Beiping, was brutally shot and killed. After several days of negotiations, the compensation was US$833.33 (equivalent to 10 million legal currency). After deducting funeral expenses, there is likely little left. Chinese people are worthless, and I can't help but feel a thousand emotions!

### Collection Novels and Collection Paintings

In the past, collection novels were popular. At that time, Haoran, Duhe, and Zhiyan, Zhenya, Shannong, Tianxu Wosheng and others took the lead in this trend. With great enthusiasm, they created the art of collection novels, each person writing one section, linking them together to form a longer work. The author had to embed the name of the next author in the previous section, showing ingenuity. I still remember such works as "Sea Moon," "Strange Electricity," "Wanwang Peng," "Red Leaf Village Hero," "Night Voyage," "Rice Pearl," "Strange Handprint," "Coral Island," "New Mockery," "Hoarding Hatred," etc. Due to their popularity with readers, single volumes of collection novels were compiled and published. How quickly times have changed. Zhiyan, Zhenya, Shannong, Tianxu Wosheng and other literary figures, once prominent, who influenced an era, now have grass growing on their graves, fallen and buried. Only Duhe and Haoran remain like flickering lights in a deserted temple. But beautiful faces are hard to maintain, and their hair is now graying; they are growing old. A few days ago, I met them at the Changhong Painting Society, where Kongwo, Xuejiao, Shufan, Tingyun, and Jichen were also present. It was an unexpected and delightful meeting. Changhong was run by Qing Xie and Xian Ou, and their brushwork was outstanding and colorful. Jichen playfully painted camellias on plain silk, Kongwo added leaves, and Tingyun added bamboo. Duhe and Haoran looked at each other and smiled, saying: "This is the old-fashioned collection style. We might as well revive it." So, they rolled up their sleeves, Duhe painted plum blossoms, Haoran painted rocks, and Xuejiao and I each painted a gnarled pine branch. Xian Ou's daughter, Caiqin, added a lingzhi mushroom on the rock, and Shufan added the inscription. Xian Ou polished it, and it turned out to be quite beautiful. Xian Ou's talented students Xu Qingyun, Lu Qingping, Chen Cuie, Zhang Qigu, Tian Wenying, and Zhang Shengmei, excited to try their hand, also collaborated on several paintings, like Shu brocade and Qi silk, intricately woven and dazzling, with harmonious colors, truly a great event of the time.

### "Price Sickness"

— A Newsboy

The First World War discovered "shell shock," but here and now, we have discovered "price sickness."

Life is, after all, of primary importance, so the level of prices strongly stimulates everyone's nerves. The increase in prices compresses everyone's life; a doubling of prices compresses people's lives by half. Now, this phenomenon is deepening and expanding. The rise in prices does not stop due to the freezing of the cost-of-living index, just as the large bills of 5,000 and 10,000 yuan do not stop being issued despite the appeals of the legislators.

In bombings, in prices, in war, everyone suffers from heart disease to some extent, or, due to too much stimulation, everyone becomes neurasthenic. This was the case during the war. As for now, it is not too far removed. Prices are still a heavy term, like a heavy lead weight pressing down on people's hearts.

Here is an example of "price sickness": A few days ago, a news report stated that a person from Shijiazhuang said that a certain gentleman in that area went shopping one day and suddenly became ill after inquiring about the prices. It was learned that this person had suffered a nervous breakdown in the rear during the war due to high prices.

A nervous breakdown caused by rising prices, an illness caused by the shock of high prices—this is ultimately a tragedy for small people in a great era. This is also the common experience of us small people. When the market prices change from morning to evening, and then develop into changing several times a day, when the price tags of goods cannot even be changed in time and are simply removed altogether, everyone is frightened and feels that the bundles of money in their pockets are decreasing in weight and value minute by minute.

Life is an extremely serious word. High prices and difficult living conditions are a severe blow to people. Those who can withstand the blow live on in misery, and those who cannot withstand the blow naturally fall ill.

Therefore, some people become ill after inquiring about prices, and some even suffer nervous breakdowns due to soaring prices.

This price sickness is incurable, isn't it? If there is a cure, we must ask our political masters.

### On "Unsentimental Antithetical Couplets"

— Ting Song

Antithetical couplets have words that match perfectly but meanings that are completely different. This is called an "unsentimental antithetical couplet." This is also the ultimate expression of the cunning of scholars. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, there was a society that specialized in making such couplets, and Zhang Wenxiang was also a member. One day, he created the couplet "The tree is already half withered, so stop the axe." Initially, Nancun was not selected for this assignment. The one who won the top prize prepared to divide the three-legged tripod and exercise power. Zhang read it and suddenly said: "This couplet can be said to be completely unrelated." So he added these seven characters, and the previous couplet was relegated to second place. Wenxiang was truly brilliant and insightful, with the style of Ji Xiaolan. In short, Chinese characters are truly rich in mystery. If interpreted rigidly, they are not masterpieces. Therefore, the original two lines of the upper couplet still had poetry and truth. But Wenxiang's response was completely conversational. The word "fruit" corresponds to the word "tree" and the word "axe" corresponds to the virtual with the real. Is it not wonderful until the autumn hairs are reversed?

Mao Heting loved to eat at Guangheju. One day, I was at the same table with him, and I happened to mention this couplet. Mao said: "This is a copy of Zhang Zhidong's trick to Taoran." There is also one that uses Zhang Xiangtao to counter the opening of a smelly ditch. Someone else at the table mentioned a couplet: "The day before yesterday, in the Fuchuan Hall in the eastern city, I ate Sichuan pickled vegetables fried with shredded mountain chicken." A certain famous scholar suddenly said: "I have a match!" Namely "Cen Chunxuan bows to Lu Fengshi." (The characters for "shredded" and "stone" are homophones, so it is skillfully done.) This couplet is also completely unrelated in meaning, but each character is perfectly matched, a work of genius, truly beyond what one could imagine. Buddha said: "Its mystery is inconceivable," which is probably what he meant.

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

Little Rong looked at him timidly and moved closer to his mother.

"Why hasn't elder sister come yet? Mom!" he asked anxiously, looking up.

In the dim light of the kerosene lamp, Lan saw that the associate directors were deliberately pulling Jin Aili towards a more remote corner. She worried that the poor girl was about to step into another trap. But she had no mind to care about others' affairs now. Soon she turned her gaze away, looking at the dark hole, and gently patted Rong's shoulder to calm him down.

From outside the cave came the muffled thunder of bombs exploding, mixed with the tight sound of machine guns.

"This is terrible," Xu Shaoming said anxiously, slapping his thigh and raising his voice to the point of shouting. "All my furniture is loaded on several tarpaulin trucks packaged by Bai, but they haven't been dispatched this afternoon. If the train station is bombed, everything will be destroyed!"

Little Shen covered a cold smile on the corner of his mouth with his hand. "Your path is too predictable, and there will be times when you suffer!" he thought to himself.

Fatty Xu was anxious and angry, like an enraged wild bull.

Lan seemed not to see any of their actions. Now, her face was even paler, her eyes were a bit fixed, staring at the entrance of the cave without blinking for a moment, but her pale red lips were constantly quivering, as if she were talking, but no sound came out.

Again, the sound of five or six large bombs exploding in a string.

"Mom! I'm so scared! Why hasn't elder sister come yet? And the rabbit daddy, you didn't bring him out!" Little Rong's small face turned red, and he frantically grabbed Lan's clothes and kneaded them.

"It's okay, Little Rong!" Lan gently patted him, her voice as if in a dream. "Uncle Zhu went to get your sister, they must have hidden somewhere too..."

"What about rabbit daddy? They will definitely bomb him to death!" Rong said, frowning, his heart so anxious that he wanted to cry.

These words reminded his mother.

"Oh!" She was obviously more anxious, breathing very rapidly, and immediately turned around and hugged Rong tightly. "Your sister must have taken rabbit daddy out to fix that tail! That child is so reckless! What should I call Uncle Zhu to look for? Oops! Terrible! Terrible!"

There was some choking in her voice, but she wasn't crying. Instead, Little Rong, forewarned by an ominous sense, was already clinging to her chest, wailing loudly (To be continued).
