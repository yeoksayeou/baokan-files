### Government Improves Foreign Exchange Control, Establishes Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, Allows Export Income and Overseas Remittances to be Settled at Market Prices, Foreign Currency and Gold Still Permitted to Circulate and Trade

[Our Newspaper, Beijing, 16th] The "Revised Measures for Foreign Exchange Control and Import-Export Trade" proposed by President Zhang were passed by the State Council meeting on the 15th. This measure is divided into two major parts, with important contents as follows: A. The Executive Yuan shall revise the interim measures for import-export trade according to the following principles, which will be implemented immediately: (1) Foreign exchange earned from exports and other remittances from abroad shall be allowed to be sold and settled at market prices, and designated banks shall be specified. (2) The import of goods shall temporarily continue to adopt the import license system. The foreign exchange required shall be provided by the Central Bank at the official price for some daily necessities, and the rest shall be allowed to be purchased from designated banks at market prices with a certificate. The list of goods and types that should be supplied with official-priced foreign exchange shall be reported to the Executive Yuan for approval by the Import-Export Control Committee at any time. As an incidental measure, the international trade organization, which previously had both export and import sections, will now be replaced by a temporary Import-Export Management Committee under the Executive Yuan. B. The Executive Yuan shall strictly manage foreign exchange according to the following principles: (1) Strictly stipulate the measures for designated banks to buy and sell foreign exchange at market prices. (2) Strictly stipulate the qualifications of designated banks and reduce the number of designated banks to facilitate investigation. (3) Supervise the operation of overseas Chinese remittances. (4) Establish a Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to be responsible for regulating the supply and demand of import-export trade and other legal foreign exchange transactions in order to balance foreign exchange market prices, with three incidental measures: (1) Strictly review institutions and personnel stationed abroad. (2) Crack down on gold speculation. (3) Prohibit the circulation of foreign currency.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The "Revised Measures for Foreign Exchange Control and Import-Export Trade" passed by the State Council meeting include the following key points in the attached "Measures to Prohibit the Circulation of Foreign Currency": Chinese and foreign people entering the country may carry foreign currency, up to US$100 or the equivalent in other currencies per person. Those exceeding this amount must voluntarily declare and register with the customs, and exchange it for national currency at the local Central Bank or its entrusted exchange on the date of entry. Those who conceal their foreign currency will have it confiscated.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] In order to eradicate the use of foreign exchange for private overseas travel and transactions related to industries that are not import-export in nature, the Executive Yuan has drafted control measures and designated responsible agencies, roughly as follows: (1) Foreign exchange applications from government agencies will be handled by the Foreign Exchange Review Committee. (2) Foreign exchange applications required for approved imports will be handled by the Import-Export Control Committee. (3) Foreign exchange applications from students approved by the Ministry of Education will be handled by the Central Bank.

### Zhang Jia'ao Returns to Shanghai to Talk, New Foreign Exchange Management Measures to be Announced Today, Hoping to Stimulate Exports and Reverse the Outflow of Overseas Remittances

[Our Newspaper] Mr. Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. The reporter immediately visited him at his residence to inquire about the government's upcoming changes to the foreign exchange management measures. Mr. Zhang received the reporter despite his illness and made the following remarks: "The State Council has already approved the new foreign exchange management measures in principle. The detailed implementation measures will be drafted separately by the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan convened a review committee at around 5:00 p.m. on the 15th to make a decision. The complete detailed measures will be officially announced at the Central Bank at around 4:00 p.m. today."

Mr. Zhang then stated: "The government, in view of the large difference between the official foreign exchange rate and the black market rate in the past, which led to the inability to absorb overseas remittances and the failure to promote exports, and the fact that most of the materials imported at the official foreign exchange rate were sold at the black market foreign exchange rate, had no choice but to seek alternative improvement measures in this state, in order to make exports more active, allow overseas remittances to flow back, and at the same time, balance the supply and demand of foreign exchange."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] The revised measures for foreign exchange control and import-export trade will be announced simultaneously in Beijing and Shanghai on the 17th. According to government sources, the purpose of this measure is to adjust the management of foreign exchange in order to revitalize import-export trade. The measure is extremely comprehensive and takes all aspects into consideration. After being passed by the State Council meeting on the 15th, the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the morning of the 16th further studied it in detail. It is believed that its purpose will definitely be achieved after implementation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] On the 16th, an economic authority commented on the "Revised Measures for Foreign Exchange Control and Import-Export Trade" drafted by Central Bank Governor Zhang Jia'ao, believing that this measure would have a positive impact on the current economic situation. The current control policy has lost its effect and has many drawbacks. If the new measures are implemented, import-export trade can be greatly revitalized, production can also be increased, and overseas remittances can no longer be avoided. In addition, considerable expenses of foreigners in China, such as charity, military, and diplomatic expenses, can also be handled through designated banks. Another positive effect is that all smuggling can be eliminated. It was heard that some people advocated a full opening, but this matter would have too great an impact and too much risk. This measure is better, with two steps to proceed more steadily.

### Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth are Absolutely Not Allowed to be Imported, Ministry of Economic Affairs Spokesperson Solemnly Denies Rumors, Qingdao Opens Control of Yarn and Cloth and Permits Export

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Committee for Guidance on Trade with Japan has decided that, among the goods permitted to be imported from Japan, except for rayon, which is currently urgently needed in China, the rest are transportation and industrial equipment that are conducive to China's construction. Cotton yarn and cloth are absolutely not included in the list of permitted imports. The news reported by a certain newspaper in Shanghai a few days ago that a large amount of cotton yarn would be imported from Japan is absolutely untrue.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 16th] The Qingdao Municipal Government previously issued an order to control the export of yarn, cloth, and raw oil due to the shortage of grain in Qingdao, and stipulated that all merchants exporting yarn, cloth, and raw oil must pledge to transport back the equivalent value of food in order to stabilize grain prices, but this has greatly affected the yarn, cloth, and raw oil market. Therefore, merchants have requested that the control measures be abolished. The municipal government has now decided to first open up the export of yarn and cloth, and the previously established method of exchanging yarn and cloth exports for food has been temporarily suspended, while the export of raw oil continues to be controlled.

### Full Text of US Note to Soviet Union Refusing to First Discuss Japanese Peace Treaty Proposals at Foreign Ministers Conference

[US News Agency, Washington, 15th] Regarding the preliminary battle for the Japanese peace treaty, the United States reiterated the reasons for its original proposal when signing the Soviet Union's counter-proposal. The US proposal is to convene an eleven-nation conference as soon as possible to draft the Japanese peace treaty and obtain the opinions of various countries at the conference. The note on this matter was delivered to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires here on Wednesday and was released by the State Department today. According to the Soviet Union's response to the US original proposal: The Soviet government believes that the issue of convening a conference to draft the Japanese peace treaty must first be reviewed temporarily by the Foreign Ministers Conference composed of representatives from China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The US government believes that the discussions on the Far East peace issue at the Potsdam Conference do not require expanding the agreement stipulated in the Potsdam Treaty for the Foreign Ministers Conference, so that the issue of resolving the Japanese peace must be resolved at the Foreign Ministers Conference. The establishment of the Foreign Ministers Conference, although based on preparing the Japanese peace treaty, the US government does not believe that this issue must be submitted to the Foreign Ministers Conference, for the following reasons: There are no clauses in the Cairo Declaration, Yalta Conference, or Potsdam Declaration on Japan that stipulate that the Foreign Ministers Conference has the right to resolve the Japanese peace. In December 1945, the four governments attending the Foreign Ministers Conference formed a commission in Moscow in order to formulate various policies, principles, and standards, so that the obligations to comply with these policies and fulfill the conditions of surrender could be fulfilled. The US government believes that this action has recognized that these countries have a major interest in the policy issues and peace agreements after Japan's surrender. Therefore, for the benefit of other countries in the Pacific, the governments of the countries attending the Foreign Ministers Conference must recognize that the organization of the current conference considering this agreement should be larger than the Foreign Ministers Conference. For this reason, the US government believes that neither the Foreign Ministers Conference established in Potsdam nor the Foreign Ministers Conference composed of the four powers pointed out by the Soviet government is an appropriate body to consider the Japanese peace treaty.

The note that the US government submitted to the other ten countries of the Far Eastern Commission on July 11 is also based on this opinion. In this note, the United States is only seeking the opinions of each country and cannot act unilaterally. Although the US government does not believe that the issue of the Japanese peace treaty should be discussed by the Foreign Ministers Conference for the above reasons, it will still forward the Soviet government's opinions to the member states of the Far Eastern Commission, and the countries attending the Foreign Ministers Conference are already included.

The US government is willing to point out that nine members of the Far Eastern Commission have already responded to the suggestions made by the US government on July 11, expressing their agreement to convene an eleven-nation Japanese peace treaty conference, which can freely decide its own procedures.

Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Soviet government will also express its willingness to participate in the conference to consider the Japanese peace treaty, which should be held in the near future and attended by the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Diplomatic officials stated on the 16th that the United States is now preparing to invite the other nine countries of the Far Eastern Commission to begin work on the Japanese peace treaty, even if there are no Soviet representatives participating. Diplomatic officials agree that the peace conference will be convened in Washington around September 10, as this is before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly (to be convened in New York).

### Wei Envoy Returns to Beijing from Guangzhou, to Go to Korea for Inspection Within Ten Days

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Wei Demai and his party returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou at 5:30 p.m. on the 16th. It is heard that their work in Guangzhou was not as ideal as expected, but they were quite satisfied with their trip to Taiwan and Shanghai. It is learned that the delegation will leave China on the 24th and fly to Korea via Tokyo. Before leaving, in addition to visiting Chairman Chiang to say goodbye, they plan to hold a cocktail party next weekend to entertain the heads of our government and people from all walks of life as a farewell.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 16th] On the morning of the 16th, Special Envoy Wei met with the leaders of the Youth Party here, Chi Zaiqing, Zhongda Professor Liu Yaosang, Zhang Daowu, Liu Weisen, Li Yiru, Feng Diancheng, and others at the US Consulate to inquire about various issues investigated by the delegation and the situation in the cultural circles here. The content of the conversation was very extensive. Wei and his party boarded the plane and left Guangzhou for Beijing in heavy rain at 2:00 p.m. after reviewing the honor guard.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 16th] When Special Envoy Wei met with Lin Zhengxuan, the leader of the Social Democratic Party here, yesterday, he inquired about his opinions on the current political and economic problems in China. Lin replied that China is confident that it has the ability to solve its current difficulties, but if it receives rapid assistance from the United States, the current difficulties can be overcome quickly. The Communist Party should bear most of the responsibility for the current difficulties. Wei expressed great sympathy for this opinion. Wei also said that the United States is not prepared to support any one party in China, but is prepared to help China in a friendly manner. Wei also said that China is currently in a very favorable environment for self-reliance, because no country is currently interfering in China's internal affairs. When Wei met with He Jiping, the chairman of the city's Chamber of Commerce, the conversation focused on economic issues, inquiring about the general equipment and production of factories in South China, and paying close attention to the traffic situation on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. He mentioned that Guangdong had economic relations with foreign countries very early. If American businessmen can invest and build in Guangdong, the people of Guangdong will have great development based on past experience. When Wei met with Wu Dingxin, the president of Minda University, and other members of the education community, he inquired whether the government interfered in the advancement and retreat of school staff and students, and the causes of this year's student unrest. Wu and others replied that the government had never interfered in the advancement and retreat of staff and students, and the main reason for the student unrest was the instigation of the Chinese Communist Party, and cited facts to prove it.

### Unidentified Nationality Aircraft Discovered on Xinjiang Border, According to Comprehensive Judgment, Data Recovery Shows it Was Conducting Illegal Cross-Border Surveying and Mapping

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 16th] According to sources, unidentified nationality aircraft often appear in the area bordering Daqiang and Pakistan in the Kashgar area of Xinjiang Province. After inquiries from various parties, the details are as follows: (1) On July 1, two aircraft of unidentified nationality intruded into the airspace above the Akberdar Pass, more than 20 li west of Bulunkou, north of Puli County in Kashgar, and circled for about two hours before flying west. (2) On July 3, another unmarked aircraft flew to the airspace above Bulunkou and circled for about four hours before flying away. (3) On July 10, an aircraft of unidentified nationality was again discovered over Nanyoumu in Uqia County, circling for about three hours before flying south. (4) On July 18, an aircraft of unidentified nationality was discovered over Bujie, about 80 li southeast of Uqia County, circling for more than three hours before flying west. According to a comprehensive judgment, the aircraft were conducting illegal aerial surveying and mapping.

### Rumor Wei Demai will Recommend Giving Me Conditional Aid

[United Press, This City News] Sources close to Special Envoy Wei Demai claimed that one of Wei's main tasks was to make a report after doubly estimating the threat of the Communist Army to China and its possible harm to American Far East policy. According to reliable sources speaking to a United Press reporter, Wei and his advisors will be preparing a report in Nanjing next Monday, reviewing the data on the overall US policy toward the world, rather than limiting it to China's needs.

Several people in the diplomatic community in China who have met with Wei and Wei's subordinates have a common feeling that the special envoy will recommend to the United States that "closely monitored aid" be given to the National Government, but so far, in addition to the special envoy's advisors, the data Wei has obtained proves that the Chinese Communist Party is a major problem for American policy. He would rather take the National Government as the lesser evil, and he is willing to recommend aid to Chairman Chiang, but he will pay more attention to the use of aid and promote the improvement of the National Government, rather than witness the formation of another Soviet satellite. (Continued from yesterday—End)

### Chairman Zhang's Remarks

(Continued from yesterday, concluded)

Allowance of 200,000 for Public School Employees in Peiping and Tientsin

Secondly, the method of allocating and selling goods to public school employees in Peiping and Shanghai has proven effective and should be maintained. Before the implementation of allocating and selling goods in Peiping and Tientsin, public school employees in these two cities will each receive an allowance of 200,000 yuan per month based on the average price difference of allocated goods in Peiping and Shanghai for June and July of this year. Due to these two measures, the state treasury's monthly burden will increase by over 20 billion yuan. Combined with the increase in basic amounts for the aforementioned regions, the total monthly increase in expenditure will be 155.58 billion yuan. According to the above methods, although the increase in treatment after this adjustment of civil servants is slightly less than that of the adjustment in May of this year, it achieves the goal of consistent treatment for civil servants. The state treasury's burden is greater than any previous adjustment, and the long-standing inequality between civil and military personnel treatment has been eliminated, which is its greatest feature. Although the treatment of civil and military personnel has been equalized, there are still significant disparities in treatment among civil servants. The treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises is generally much better than that of ordinary civil servants, which is very unfair. The former Supreme National Defense Council also considered the special circumstances of state-owned enterprises and stipulated in the measures for the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprise organs that "the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprise organs may be determined independently based on their usual practices, but the total amount of their income shall not be less than 20% of the income of civil servants of equivalent rank, nor shall it be higher than 110%." Since the promulgation of these measures, many state-owned enterprises have strictly complied with the regulations, ensuring that their personnel's treatment does not exceed 110% of that of civil servants. However, the actual income of some state-owned enterprise personnel is several times higher than that of civil servants of equivalent rank. Although the government has repeatedly instructed these state-owned enterprises to comply with the above regulations and reduce their personnel's treatment, the accumulated inertia is difficult to reverse.

Treatment of Employees in State-Owned Enterprises to be Reduced

During this adjustment of civil and military personnel treatment, when making them consistent, the government decided to supervise and implement the regulations of the former Supreme National Defense Council regarding the excessive treatment of state-owned enterprise personnel beyond the scope stipulated by the National Defense Council, ensuring that the inequality in treatment among civil servants and the violation of government regulations no longer exist. This is the second feature of this treatment adjustment.

Strictly Address Troop Shortages, Military Expenses to be Used for Public Purposes

After this adjustment of the treatment of civil and military personnel and personnel in state-owned enterprises, I have two sincere hopes: First, since the treatment of military personnel is now consistent with that of civil servants, the amount increased for each person is very significant, and the state treasury's burden is even heavier. I sincerely hope that the military leaders in charge will strictly order their subordinates to be strict about troop shortages and military expenditures. In addition to strictly implementing the accounting and auditing systems, the government will also improve the inspection methods to ensure that military expenditures are used for public purposes and to eliminate waste. I am confident that all military leaders and troops will understand this intention and conscientiously comply. Second, the basic amount of the increase in treatment for civil servants this time is 100,000 yuan, which is difficult to keep up with the upper limit of prices. The government is deeply concerned about the hardships of civil servants' lives. However, at this time of financial deficit, we must consider the state treasury's burden. I hope that our civil servants will uphold their consistent spirit of loyalty to the country and share the difficulties of the times. This is what I hope for.

### Members of the Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan Appointed; Outline of Regulations for the Business Delegation Approved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The members of the Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan have been officially appointed. The list is as follows: Chairman: Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Yi Jiling. Members: Deputy Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, Zhu Xie; Counselor of the Ministry of Transportation, Jin Shixuan; Assistant Officer of the East Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Jiecai; Chief Secretary of the National Resources Commission, Wu Zhaohong; Head of the Third Group of the National Economic Council, Chen Zongjing; Manager of the Trade Department of the Central Trust of China, He Molin.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The second meeting of the Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan was held on the morning of the 16th, chaired by Yang Shuren. The "Outline of Regulations for the Implementation of the Organizational Measures for the Business Delegation to Japan" was approved. Once this outline is submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation, the committee will reconvene to discuss the preparations for the business delegation. The outline consists of five points: (1) The number of delegates is still set at 20, namely 13 from private industrial and commercial enterprises, 5 from public enterprises, and 2 from overseas Chinese businesses. (2) The selection criteria stipulate that candidates must not only have rich experience and ability in trade with Japan, but also have sufficient funds. (3) The selection procedure for public enterprise candidates will be jointly designated by the various units of the enterprise. The candidates for private enterprises will be first discussed and determined by the Federation of Commerce and the Industrial Association, and then recommended separately by the local branches of the above two units. (4) The types of import and export goods must first be checked against the trade measures set by the Far Eastern Commission, but may be adjusted independently by our country when necessary. (5) Trade settlement is still determined to adopt a ledger settlement system, which in nature is equivalent to an import-export linkage system.

### Smuggling of Japanese Goods is Worrying: Shui Xiangyun Talks About Opening Trade with Japan

[Our Report] Shui Xiangyun said: "After trade with Japan is opened, the most worrying thing is the rampant smuggling. Our country currently has import controls, which have proven to be ineffective in preventing smuggling. This is the case with American goods, and even more so with Japanese goods. In the past, American goods were expensive, and only a few people enjoyed them. The sales were mainly in the cities. However, Japanese goods are cheaper and will inevitably penetrate the countryside. Therefore, the smuggling of Japanese goods is almost inevitable. The route will probably be first to Taiwan, then to Hong Kong as a base, and then northwards from South China. Japan's manufacturing of cosmetics and exquisite goods is superior to even the United States in some areas. Our country learned the technology of the rubber industry from Japan. How can we compete with them today? In other industries such as the manufacturing and chemical industries, our country is not Japan's enemy. If smuggling cannot be strictly prohibited, then national industries will be threatened, and unemployment will inevitably increase." Shui also said that when he went to Peiping to petition, a certain important official said that there were unavoidable difficulties in opening trade with Japan, "One is due to the general trend in the international community, and we cannot oppose it alone. The second is that MacArthur ordered the opening of private trade with Japan based on the Potsdam Agreement before the Far Eastern Commission met to discuss it, so that the Far Eastern Commission could no longer overturn MacArthur's decision."

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 16th] The large-scale annihilation war launched by the National Army's combined land and air forces against the remnants of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops fleeing to eastern Henan fiercely unfolded on the 16th.

The left-wing National Army corps was advancing rapidly south from Zhuishan Shangqiu, echoing the right-wing army and attacking the remnants of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in Qixian, Suicheng, Fugou, and Ningling. The battle is fiercely underway. According to surrendered communist bandits, Liu's remnants fled south of the Longhai Railway and, after a short respite, were once again surrounded and annihilated by the National Army on three sides. The bandit officers and soldiers felt that they were facing a desperate situation with only death ahead. Liu Yangyan said that when there was no other choice, he would flee south to the Dabie Mountains.

### Chen Cheng Returns to Shenyang via Jilin; Denies He Will Stay in the Northeast to Oversee Military Affairs; Headquarters Will Merge into the Xing Yuan on the 20th

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 16th] Chen Cheng flew to Jilin at 10:00 AM on the 16th for inspection, accompanied by Zheng Dongguo and Liang Huasheng.

### Continued Hearing of the Case of the US Soldier Throwing People into the Water in Beijing; Father of the Deceased Appears in Court to Describe the Tragedy; More Witnesses Need to be Summoned and the Hearing Will Resume on the 18th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Zhonghe Bridge tragedy continued to be heard today. In the morning and afternoon, the US soldiers Hulat and Parker, who testified yesterday, Huang Shuncheng, who took pictures of the body, Tu Chonghai, who testified yesterday, Wang Guohua, the father of the victim Wang Shouben, Yuan Youyin, who lived with Wang Shouben, Cao Xinghao, the landlord, Yin Ruisheng, who witnessed the two men being pushed into the water, Fan Decai and Huang Youcai, who salvaged the body, and US soldier Weite Tuo and other eleven people were summoned one after another. Since there are still many witnesses who need to be summoned, it was decided to resume the hearing on the morning of the 18th.

Wang Guohua, the father of Wang Shouben, who is over forty years old, could not contain his grief when he appeared in court to describe the circumstances of his son's death. According to reports, his son did not know how to swim and never bathed or fished by the river. It was definitely not an accidental fall into the water. After answering the questions, he intended to continue making statements regarding the matter of consolation. The court considered this point to be beyond the scope of the court's trial, so it opened a secret court to discuss it and decided that the prosecutor and the defense counsel should first explain this situation to Wang outside the court. Afterwards, Wang re-entered the court and said in a sad tone: "The United States is the strongest and most powerful country in the world. My young son was now thrown into the water for no reason. I am very sad in my heart. My family of three rooms has only this one son. Now that this accident has happened, who will I rely on for life in the future? The family members of the deceased are in difficulty, and I hope that they can be taken care of." After speaking, he bowed to the entire audience and said in an excited tone: "Thank you for your help."

As for Yin Ruisheng, who witnessed Wang Shouben and others being pushed into the water at that time, he made a living by fishing. He happened to be there when the incident happened. When he appeared in court, he was wearing a short shirt and trousers and incomplete shoes and socks. He looked completely like a simple farmer, and his speech was simple and responsible. According to reports, he witnessed Wang Shouben and Ge Fatian being pushed into the water one after another. The clothing of the pushers was the same as the judges in the court (US military uniform). Wang Shouben was still struggling with his hands after being pushed down. Before long, another person was pushed into the water. Another Chinese on the bridge ran away and was spared. There were three Americans on the scene at that time, and another one was sitting in a jeep. The moonlight was bright that night, so there was no possibility of misidentification. In order to be accurate, the prosecutor and others also presented maps and photos to let him point out the location of the incident, and Yin answered truthfully one by one.

### Chongqing Newspaper Workers Strike; Only Three Newspapers Published Yesterday

Workers Demand a Pay Raise of More Than Double

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 16th] In Chongqing on the morning of the 16th, only Dagong, Xinmin, and Xinhua newspapers were published. Other newspapers were not published. The management and labor sides have been brewing a dispute for a long time over the issue of wage increases. The printing workers of each newspaper requested an increase of 150% or 100% because the wages were too low, but the person in charge of the Newspaper Association insisted on an increase of 30%. The conciliation of all parties was ineffective, resulting in a deadlock. The printing workers were angry and gathered at the General Labor Union on the evening of the 15th, and decided to hold a temporary emergency strike. However, Dagong and other three newspapers still published the newspapers because the labor and management sides had a tacit understanding beforehand. The Bureau of Social Affairs convened a meeting of the labor and management sides on the afternoon of the 16th, hoping to mediate and resolve the issue as soon as possible.

### Wang Maogong Lists Methods for Emergency Relief to Cure and Manage Water Disasters in Northern Jiangsu; Appeals to the Central Government to Quickly Allocate Huge Amounts of Relief Funds

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] After returning to Nanjing from Xu on the 15th, Su Chairman Wang Maogong immediately consulted with Gu Zhenggang and Xue Dubi on the issue of water disasters in northern Jiangsu and discussed relief and rehabilitation methods. It was decided to submit the reports and proposals of the Ministry of Water Resources and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan. At the same time, it was also proposed to ask the Xingzong to allocate grain for disaster relief.

In addition, Wang specifically presented the following seven emergency measures to the central authorities for flood control in the border areas of the four provinces of Xin, Yu, An, and He, as a result of the investigations and contacts between Wang and local people from Xuhai: (1) The water systems in northern Jiangsu are complicated and interconnected with the three provinces of Lu, Yu, and An. It is believed that effective flood control cannot be achieved without a unified water conservancy organization in the border areas of several provinces. Please quickly set a plan and install a permanent and fixed organization under the Department of Water Conservancy in Xu to manage the water conservancy in the border areas of the four provinces of Su, Lu, An, and Yu to relieve the water conservancy problems of several provinces and control them in time to avoid future troubles. (2) The 5.7 billion yuan for the revetment dam closure project previously requested should be approved and allocated as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity. (3) There are 5 million victims in Xuhuaihai. They have now begun to form teams to flee the famine. Please approve the quick allocation of 20 billion yuan in emergency relief funds to provide relief to the victims and replace accounts with work, dredge river channels, and build embankments to control water disasters. (4) Please quickly order the Four Joint Headquarters to allocate 10 billion yuan in emergency agricultural loans to the Xuhuaihai water disaster area, 10 billion yuan in seed loans, and approve a large number of agricultural land and water conservancy loans to maintain people's livelihood. (5) Please

### Editorial: Foreign Exchange Control is Liberated

The Central Bank's proposed revision of foreign exchange regulations and import-export trade management measures was approved by the State Council on the 15th. The main points are: (1) Opening up foreign exchange. (2) Managing import and export trade. This is the most significant reform in our country's foreign trade since November 4, 1935, and it is also what the majority of people at home and abroad have keenly hoped for.

Because the implementation of the legal tender policy and the determination of the foreign exchange rate both started on that day. By March 14, 1938, the "Measures for Applying for Approval to Purchase Foreign Exchange" were announced. In the winter of 1941, the U.S. dollar rate was fixed at 20 yuan. In January 1944, the subsidy for overseas remittances and missionary U.S. dollars was changed to 100 percent. In July 1945, the overseas remittance subsidy was changed back to 480 yuan, totaling 500 yuan, equivalent to one U.S. dollar. By February 25, 1946, the foreign exchange market was opened, setting the U.S. dollar rate at 2,020 yuan. On August 19, it was reset to 3,350 yuan. On February 16 of this year, it was further set at 12,000 yuan. However, these figures are just official rates. Those with funds are unwilling to settle and sell at these rates, and those applying for foreign exchange find it even more difficult to settle and purchase at these rates. Because the black market rate is too far from the official rate, a stalemate has formed, making it impossible for import and export businesses to operate. Foreign businessmen are especially burdened, causing large amounts of overseas remittances to be diverted, and smuggling is rampant, becoming an almost open secret.

To break this deadlock, calls for lifting foreign exchange controls have long been widespread. Although the authorities have repeatedly denied it, they are not unaware of the seriousness of the problem. The reason for their hesitation and reluctance to implement decisive measures, even to the point of unwillingness to implement import-export linkage systems and disregarding the private exchange of privately held gold for foreign exchange, lies in their efforts to avoid stimulating prices.

Now that foreign exchange has been opened up, prices in general will inevitably fluctuate again, naturally adjusting to a new level. This is unavoidable. What we earnestly hope for is: (1) Designated banks must handle the settlement of incoming or outgoing foreign exchange at market prices and avoid creating additional complications, which would create another black market. In particular, the settlement of foreign exchange from exports must be facilitated as much as possible to promote exports and avoid the recurrence of smuggling. (2) The management of imports must be tightened to prevent foreign goods from being dumped, threatening the survival of national industries. (3) Strict prevention of capital flight to deepen the difficulties in the economic sector. (4) The supply of foreign exchange for people's livelihood necessities at par prices should be handled transparently to avoid criticism at home and abroad. (5) Within the possible range, a wide range of foreign exchange stabilization funds should be raised to fulfill the responsibility of regulation. Unnecessary fluctuations at the natural level should be prevented at any time to stabilize prices and stabilize life. (6) Various conveniences should be given to the recovery of foreign capital and the repatriation of profits to attract foreign capital and help construction.

What is a pity is that the authorities have never determined a large-scale purchase policy and sales steps for export goods. Although foreign exchange is moving, general local goods will inevitably blindly increase in price to offset the benefits gained from the exchange rate. This will lose an excellent opportunity to absorb foreign exchange and promote exports.

### Another Measure of the United States' Indulgence Toward Japan

Japan's private foreign trade officially opened yesterday. A few days before the opening of trade, the Far Eastern Commission announced a resolution on Japan's temporary import and export policy and sent it to Supreme Commander MacArthur for implementation. According to a United Press report, the Far Eastern Commission has fully lent 137 million yuan to Japan as a revolving fund for import and export trade. On the 14th, just as the Japanese government and public were celebrating the opening of trade, MacArthur announced that he would lend Japan more than 500 million yuan as a trade fund, using Japan's gold and silver reserves as a tool to obtain foreign exchange. Japanese Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama, grateful for the many support of the Allied Headquarters, made an important report to the Diet with excitement, and the Diet passed a letter of thanks to MacArthur. The smiling faces of Katayama and the Diet members have forgotten the sorrow of surrendering in a desperate state two years ago and have begun to pursue a new future.

Regarding MacArthur's opening of Japan's private trade, we have already commented on the gains and losses to the Allied countries. Whether or not our country should agree to the opening of Japan's trade, the basic control lies with us. We have repeatedly stated the advantages and disadvantages. The editorial of this newspaper on July 29 pointed out that the Japanese government and people have formulated various ambitious plans for the opening of trade and hope to restore foreign trade to obtain a large loan of 1 billion from the United States. The so-called obligation to compensate the defeated country may be put aside, unasked and undiscussed. Looking at the news reports in the past few days, Japan's foreign trade has not only been successfully opened, but even MacArthur has publicly announced loans to Japan to invigorate its trade and develop its trade. This was something we expected, but MacArthur's tolerant and generous measures toward Japan will be a great loss to the rights of the Allied countries, and we cannot but express our dissent.

First, we do not oppose Japan's revitalization, but the Allied countries should jointly oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and aggression. Looking at Japanese newspapers and magazines, they have already formulated various economic revitalization plans, production increase plans, and the US loan to Japan of 1 billion US dollars plan, and use coal production increase and shipping income to fill the loan repayment; in fact, these production plans are the revival of capitalist economy, and may even exceed the level of 1930-34, if according to these plans, Japan's excess production will need a huge market, followed by plunder and aggression. Japan's existing industrial equipment has not yet been dismantled for compensation, even if dismantled according to the 1930 level, Japan's industrial equipment can still maintain an organic body, such as the United States loans Japan, Japan and then with manufactured goods in exchange for new machines, then Japan's new capitalism, will become a great view. Obviously, this is not economic revitalization, but the living of militarism and aggression factors, in the Allied countries' justice position, should express opposition.

Second, we advocate that Japan's compensation, in addition to in-kind compensation, should be carried out in cash compensation way, therefore now sealed Japan's gold treasures, should not be unsealed and transferred to trade funds. When Japan surrendered, the Allied Headquarters would seal Japan about 200 million US dollars, a saying that the value of 140 million US dollars of gold and treasures, according to the majority of the Allied countries' proposal, should be used for cash compensation, can not be transferred to other purposes. The so-called "cash compensation" is not a harsh request of the victorious country to the defeated country, there is a historical precedent. Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, I was defeated incense to compensate Japan 230 million taels, the Treaty of Versailles, Germany to the Allied countries also fulfill cash compensation obligations. Now. The Japanese Peace Conference has not yet been convened, the cash compensation issue is pending, now the Far East Committee has agreed to lend 137 million US dollars to Japan, probably refers to the unsealing of Japanese gold treasures, if there is such a thing, our judgment is not wrong, then the Allied countries self-destruct the compensation rights, for the future of the chaos, chiseled damage in the darkness, it is difficult to imagine. We stand in the Allied countries' justice position, should express anti-

Now the Allied countries and Japan peace treaty has not been concluded, the state of peace has not been restored, the United States unilateral action loans Japan, is very unwise, our Chinese folk newspapers attitude, and does not agree with the United States indulgence of Japan's another measure.

### Twenty American Foreign Ministers Gather in the Capital of Brazil to Discuss the Defense of American Peace; the Anti-Communist Issue is Especially Emphasized by Various Countries

[Central News Agency, Pedro Polys, 15th] The Pan-American Conference opened at 4 pm today at the Quitandinha Hotel in Betero, located 40 miles north of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's summer capital. It is the second gathering of foreign ministers from American countries since 1945 to formulate a broad defense plan for the Western Hemisphere and maintain the peace and security of the American continent. The opening ceremony of today's conference was simple and grand, its sole purpose being to transform the wartime temporary defense plan of the American continent (namely, the Chapultepec Treaty) into a permanent one. The treaty was concluded at the Mexico Conference in 1945 and stipulates the use of force when necessary to protect the peace of the continent. Brazilian President Dutra delivered the opening speech, emphasizing the great significance of the conference. At the closing of this morning's preparatory meeting, Brazilian Foreign Minister Fernandai Tiqi was elected chairman of the conference. The Uruguayan representative proposed to stop the civil war in Paraguay, and Argentina seconded the proposal. The action to stop the civil war is expected to be decided at the plenary session. A total of 20 countries are participating in this conference. Nicaragua was not invited because the Nicaraguan government, which came to power after the coup in May of this year, has not been recognized by any country on the American continent.

[Central News Agency, Pedro Polys, 15th] The Pan-American Conference today revealed that the countries participating in the conference have agreed that aggression against any one of them is equivalent to aggression against all of them, so the countries will take collective action against the aggressor. However, various signs now indicate that the conference will inevitably fiercely debate how to agree on the question of taking action against the aggressor. Among them, 18 countries support using a two-thirds vote to bind the entire body. Argentina will defend the theory of using a unanimous vote as the basis for the collective action vote, which in fact is equivalent to a veto. Only Haiti supports Argentina's theory. Informed observers believe that this conference may focus on anti-communism, as the threat of communism has already lurked in the Americas.

### Marshall Clarifies the American Position on the Western Hemisphere Defense Treaty, Advocating Collective Action Against Aggressors

[Central News Agency, Pedro Polys, 15th] Marshall publicly announced the United States' position on the two-thirds voting system in the Western Hemisphere Defense Treaty regarding the mobilization of defense, which will be signed here soon, at a press conference held after the opening of the Pan-American Conference this afternoon. Marshall said: The U.S. delegation will propose that the collective measures specifically stipulated in the Chapultepec Resolution, when agreed upon through consultation by a two-thirds vote, will be the common obligation of all contracting parties. The only exception is that no country may be forced to supply troops without its own permission. He also announced that the majority of American countries, in response to the proposed treaty, expressed agreement that the resolution on collective measures should be the common obligation of all contracting parties. According to the Chapultepec Resolution, contracting parties must also use various methods, such as severing diplomatic or commercial relations, and as a last resort, using force, to unanimously stop or combat aggressors.

### Soviet Proposal for International Control of Atomic Energy is Rejected

[Reuters, Lake Success, 15th] The Soviet Union's attempt to have its proposal on atomic energy control accepted by the United Nations organization before the United Nations General Assembly is held in September failed finally today. The 12 members of the Political Committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission recently passed a Canadian resolution with a majority of ten votes, confirming that the Soviet Union's international atomic energy control plan is not appropriate in its current form. Now that the Political Committee is facing an apparently insurmountable situation, it has decided to adjourn until August 25 to resume discussion of the second report submitted by the Atomic Energy Commission to the Security Council.

### Freedom of the Press Conference to be Held in March Next Year

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 15th] After three days of intense debate, the Economic and Social Council finally passed a resolution tonight to convene an international conference on freedom of the press in Geneva on March 23 next year.

### US Policy Toward Korea Remains Unchanged; Hodge's Policies are Not in Conflict with Washington; Brown Accuses the Soviet Side of Undermining Negotiations

[US News Agency, Washington, 15th] The US State Department announced today that the US policy toward Korea remains consistent, that is, to ensure that Korea will become a free, united, and sovereign country, and to establish a democratic government that represents public opinion. It is inaccurate to say that the policies followed by US Commander Hodge in Korea are different from those stated here. The United States has only one policy toward Korea, and General Hodge is faithfully implementing it in a complex and difficult environment. At present, in addition to the funds that Congress has allocated to the War Department to assist Korea, Washington government agencies are now working closely with General Hodge to complete relevant research in order to further assist Korea.

[Sin-Ya News Agency, Seoul, 16th] US Representative to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, Major General Brown, recently issued a statement stating that the current deadlock in the Joint Commission is due to the Soviet side's insistence on producing a list of political parties and organizations in the subcommittee, which is similar to exercising a veto. However, the Soviet side cannot provide sufficient evidence for the organizations it claims should be removed from the consultation. According to the Soviet side's proposal, the left-right balance of Korean political parties and organizations should be in a ratio of three to two, that is, the left wing must occupy an absolute advantage, which seems quite unfair.

### New Developments in the Vietnam Situation; the War May End; Bola returned home to report to the Prime Minister

[United Press, Paris, 15th] French High Commissioner to Vietnam Bola arrived in Lyon today to visit Prime Minister Rama de, who is participating in the Socialist Party Congress in the area, for talks. It is reported that Rama de will jointly return to Paris with Bola to convene a cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Vietnam, and there may be a possibility of ending the eight-month war there.

### Security Council Continues to Debate Indonesian Issue; Dutch Representative Faces All-Around Criticism; Philippine Representative Announces Formal Recognition of Indonesia on the Spot

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 15th] The Security Council's debate on the Indonesian issue has lasted for two weeks. As of today, the theme of the debate can be summarized in the following point: Whether the United Nations can legally deal with matters that the Dutch government has recently referred to as "purely internal affairs." The Security Council did not conduct a formal vote on this issue tonight. US Representative Johnson suggested that the Security Council immediately adjourn and not make any decisions on this issue for the time being. This suggestion has been passed. Before Johnson's speech, the Australian representative fiercely criticized colonial countries, saying that they repeatedly accused the Security Council of legal jurisdiction in order to prevent the Council from taking action on the Indonesian issue. Dutch Representative Tseng bluntly stated that the Security Council had no ability to handle the Dutch-Indonesian conflict. Dutch Representative Kleffens said that the Dutch government would never intend to have the Security Council investigate the Dutch-Indonesian conflict and suggested two points: (1) Indonesia and the Netherlands should each select one country, and then these two countries should select an impartial third country to rely on the good offices of these three countries to report to the world on the situation in Indonesia. (2) All "professional consuls" stationed in Batavia should immediately draft a joint report on the situation in Indonesia. The Philippine representative announced that the Philippine government officially recognized the Indian Federation, Pakistan, and Indonesia today. He also strongly defended the Security Council's right to handle the Indonesian issue and asked the Security Council to take action immediately. The Philippines supported Australia's proposal, and Poland supported the Philippines.

### Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone Announces: Cracking Down on Communist Bandit Espionage Agency; Eleven Principal and Accessory Offenders Arrested in Shanghai; Large Quantities of Documents, Books, Intelligence Originals, and Counterfeit Money Seized

The Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone recently announced the cracking of a communist bandit military espionage agency case. The details are as follows: Since the Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone was forced to strike at the communist bandits in northern Jiangsu last July, according to the intelligence gathered from various sources, the bandit side had established a military espionage agency in Shanghai, specializing in reconnaissance of the National Army's movements, troop strength, and numbers, which were transmitted to the bandit army at any time for advance deployment. It also engaged in activities that endangered the National Army's actions, and the organization was massive in scale. It was later discovered that "Lu Zhiying, the Shanghai Special Commissioner of the Liaison Department of the Central China Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party," was the principal instigator of the northern Jiangsu communist bandit military espionage agency. Lu's whereabouts, address, and his front organizations were also obtained from various intelligence sources. Because Lu and his accomplices had a vast network and were extremely alert, in order to quickly crack the case and prevent leaks, officers were dispatched to Shanghai to secretly arrest Lu Zhiying. A large number of documents, books, intelligence originals, and counterfeit banknotes with face values of 500 yuan and 2,000 yuan, totaling 2 million yuan in legal currency, were seized from Lu Zhiying's residence on the third floor of No. 8, Lane 3, Route Ghisi. In his front organizations, including the Datong Food Store, Weida Food Company, and Ruijucheng Food Company, his accomplices Lu Kexu, Fu Youzhai, Chen Huihe, Wu Xiuzhen, Wu Baolin, Zhuang Feng, Yao Yongxiang, Yang Ying, Sun Yiqiang, She Guangde, and others were arrested. A large number of documents, books, printing plates, and other items were seized.

Lu Zhiying's Crimes

Based on the seized documents, Lu Zhiying's crimes were found to be: (1) Hosting communist bandit military espionage in northern Jiangsu, probing military secrets, and endangering our military actions. (2) Reconnoitering our army's movements, codes, and numbers to supply the bandit army, carrying out actions detrimental to our army. (3) Smuggling ammunition and firearms to supply the bandit army for combat. (4) Privately transporting materials for export, obtaining military supplies and raw materials to supply the bandit army and prolong the rebellion. (5) Establishing a Shanghai uprising special operations organization, and being responsible for developing and deploying special agents' networks in the Northeast, Qingdao, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places. (6) Infiltrating various military and political organs to engage in counterintelligence work. (7) Purchasing various military telephone and telecommunications materials and transporting them to various parts of northern Jiangsu for the bandit army's use. (8) Printing a large number of counterfeit banknotes to disrupt the financial system. (9) Establishing transportation and liaison work in coastal counties. (10) Planning various riots to brew bloodbaths as pretexts. (11) Attempting to instigate mutiny. Lu Zhiying and others' actions constitute the crimes of rebellion, endangering the state, and counterfeiting currency under the Criminal Law. The principal and accessory offenders have been successively arrested. The Headquarters of the First Pacification Zone believes that Lu and others' crimes are obvious and undeniable, and they had to be arrested to eradicate the communist bandits' dangerous schemes. However, due to the serious nature of the case, investigation takes time after the arrest to ensure that no one is wrongly accused or let off, so the announcement was delayed until now. Lu Zhiying and others are currently being interrogated and judged according to law.

### Communist Bandits Arrested During Activities in Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] The Funing County Government sent a telegram to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters last month, stating that Township Head Yang Dianying reported that Huang Huiming, a recidivist who violated the regulations on repentance and self-renewal, and bandit party member Hui Shengmao had fled to Shanghai together and were living in Zhuan Mingfu's home. Hui Huiming had killed Kuomintang member Zhou Weilu and landlords Hui Mingling and Dai Yuanfeng. They requested a nearby arrest. The headquarters also received a report from Hui Zuzuo, stating that Hui Huiming had killed his father. After police investigation, it was discovered that Hui was in the Zhabei Datong Road area, disguised as a rickshaw repairman. Detectives were dispatched to arrest him. He confessed that he was under the command of Zhang Buda, the New Fourth Army's person in charge in Shanghai, and was doing intelligence work. Zhang Buda was then arrested. Yesterday morning, the police department transferred the two criminals, Hui and Zhang, to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Communist Prisoner Sun Bingcheng Bitterly Recalls the Past; The So-Called Liberated Area Is Actually a Living Hell; Fourteen-Year-Old Soldier Dared Not Write Home

The first batch of 1,799 communist bandit prisoners from the Northeast arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 15th aboard the Hai Zhou, awaiting transfer to Wuchang for centralized training. Reporters from various Shanghai newspapers went to the Qiujiang Wharf yesterday morning to board the Hai Zhou to interview the prisoners. They were all surprised and grateful for the generous treatment they were currently receiving and testified that their belief that the National Army was barbaric was the result of malicious propaganda. Sun Chengcheng, a communist party member who served in the Eighth Route Army for eight years and once served as a county government secretary and liaison instructor, declared with sincere emotion after bitterly recounting the communist party's crimes: "From now on, I will forever stand on the side of the government and will never reconcile with the communist party. I will, from a position of justice, denounce to the world the anesthetic education I was forced to receive in the past!"

Subjected to Thought Control

Sun is a native of Taian County, Shandong Province, originally named Sun Dianchen, 27 years old. He received higher primary school education and later graduated from the bandit side's Jian Guo School and Binhai Middle School. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was a guerrilla in his hometown. Later, he was persuaded by the bandit army to join the bandit side. In 1940, he officially became a communist party member and fought in various parts of Shandong. Later, he secretly went to Guanwai with the bandit army. When he was captured, he was the company instructor of the Independent First Division (commander named Wu Duanlin) of the Liaodong Military Region of the bandit side. He claimed that everything in the past was the result of being deceived, subjected to thought control, and restricted in his actions, with no freedom at all.

Being Captured Is a Fortunate Thing

Now he has regained sight from the darkness. He stated: If given the opportunity, he is willing to join the National Army to fight and serve as a "pioneer" in recovering the entire Shandong. Sun also announced to the public, based on his actual experience of participating in the bandit army's rebellion for many years: Except for a few stubborn veteran cadres, all soldiers in the soldier class are tired of war, but the bandit side's cadres have extremely strict control, and there are few opportunities to escape, so everyone considers being captured a fortunate thing. The lives of the bandit army soldiers are extremely bitter, with a monthly salary of only 50 yuan in bandit currency, not enough to buy two packs of cigarettes. Many party officials are involved in corruption and malpractice. The class struggle they are trying to pursue has caused the rich to flee and the poor to hate. The so-called "liberated area" is actually a human "living hell."

Tears Streaming Down His Face

Another person, Li Shuheng, is only 14 years old, a native of Harbin with parents, brothers, and sisters. When he was studying in a private school at the beginning of this year, he was captured by the bandit army to serve as a messenger. His family members are currently unaware of his whereabouts. This innocent little soldier told reporters that he missed his family very much, but he is not allowed to write a letter to inform his family, fearing that the bandit side would find out and slaughter his entire family. As he spoke, tears could not help but stream down his face.

### Case of Famine Relief Rice Entering the Black Market: Three Rice Merchants Interrogated for the First Time; The Owner of Zhenjiang Longmao Rice Shop, a Principal Suspect, Detained

The case of the [Relief] Federation's allocated famine relief rice entering the black market was investigated for the first time at the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday. The Relief Federation allocated famine relief rice to the Relief Administration, which was then distributed to the Yangzi Jiang River Conservancy Commission and national schools in various counties for use. Unexpectedly, Xu Burong, the director of the education section of the Xinghua County Government, Principal Zhang, Principal Jie, Ma Zhenhai, the principal of the Anting Town Central National School in Kunshan, Yao Renlong, the principal of the Qiwang Town National School in Wuxian, and others privately sold the famine relief rice to the Longmao Rice Shop in Zhenjiang, which then sold it on the black market, totaling more than 3,000 bags. Rice merchants Song Xijing and Li Enzhong from this city went to Zhenjiang to purchase rice and transported the famine relief rice to Shanghai, storing it in the Tongtai Gong Rice Mill at No. 96 Ninghai West Road. In mid-last month, Fang Deng, an American inspector from the Relief Federation, and Wei Tongsheng, a British inspector, discovered this and reported it to the Relief Federation, which informed the Relief Administration and requested the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. Prosecutor Zhu Xiyu interrogated rice merchants Song Xijing and Li Sizhong yesterday and ordered them to return. He Junheng, the owner of the Zhenjiang Longmao Rice Shop, is a major suspect and has been detained. Fang Deng also appeared in court yesterday as a witness, stating that there is a detailed investigation report, which is currently at the Relief Administration.

They were sent to the Railway Public Charity Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the relevant authorities ordered officials to thoroughly investigate the truth and handle the matter.

### Following the Example of Local Worthies: Loyalty and Courage to Serve the Country; Comfort Meeting at Zhongzheng Park Welcomes Hunan New Recruits Passing Through; Communist Special Agents Were Physically Fit, Many with High School or University Education

[Report from this newspaper] Hunan expatriates in Shanghai, including Chuan Zhengqi, Zhang Wei, Fang Dingying, Zhang Shizhao, and Li Weicheng, held a comfort meeting at Zhongzheng Park yesterday afternoon to welcome the Hunan new recruits passing through Shanghai and to encourage the soldiers going on expedition. More than 8,000 new recruits arrived in formation before 3:00 PM. Representatives from various sectors, including Fang Zhi from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Xie Renzhao, Zhang Xiaosong from the Civil Affairs Office, and Xie Dahuang from the Military Service Association, also attended.

After the ceremony, Fang Dingying, the chairman of the presidium, delivered a welcome speech. Fang Zhi, Xie Dahuang, and others also spoke, praising the patriotic spirit displayed by Hunan throughout history and listing the glorious deeds of Hunan people who were loyal and courageous in serving the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. They hoped that the new recruits would carry on the glorious footsteps of their predecessors under the national policy of suppressing rebellion and building the country. Subsequently, Zhang Kai, an 11-year-old Hunan child living in Shanghai, gave a speech. When he shouted in his passionate Hunan accent, "Today I am here to send you off on your expedition, and one day I will be here to welcome you back in triumph," the whole audience burst into applause, and some new recruits were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes.

Although After a Long Journey, Standing Tall Without Fatigue

After Jiang Changbao, a representative of the new recruits, spoke, the conference distributed 50 million yuan in condolence money and 5,000 packages of condolence medicine. Although the new recruits had traveled a long distance, they stood tall in the hot sun for two hours yesterday without any fatigue. When Commander Wei and Committee Chairman Fang stepped forward to ask them individual questions, the new recruits unanimously replied, "The accommodations are very comfortable, and the food is also excellent." Their words expressed deep gratitude for the concern shown by the millions of citizens of this city.

Zhang Zhongfan, the commander of the Hunan South Garrison District New Recruit Corps, led the Hunan new recruits to Shanghai this time. According to him, the 10,000 people who arrived in Shanghai this time included the first batch of new recruits recruited from the four garrison districts in southeast, northwest Hunan. There are three more batches, totaling 30,000 people, who will also be recruited and developed one after another. The people of Hunan are actively participating in the recruitment, considering being recruited a great honor. Hunan was a revolutionary base in the past, and patriots and great men have emerged in every generation, so the patriotic feelings of the people are far higher than in other places.

Promoting National Health Is of Utmost Importance

Not only are they physically strong, but also percentage. For university qualifications" percentage of 25 have high school qualifications, and percentage of 20 are merchants and farmers, farmers accounting for only half of the total number, which shows that their enlistment this time is entirely out of patriotic enthusiasm.

After the meeting, the reporter visited Shanghai Garrison District Commander Chuan Zhengmo. Commander Fu expressed regret over the phenomenon of people in the Jiangnan area neglecting military service. He was particularly impressed by the physical strength of the people of Hunan. According to investigations, more than 50 percentage of the new recruits recently recruited in Suzhou have venereal diseases. He said: "Even if they are not drafted, these people will become a waste to the country, so promoting national morality and national health is more urgent than military service work."

Chief of General Staff Chen Cares About the Treatment of New Recruits

The Ministry of National Defense pays close attention to the management and treatment of new recruits awaiting transportation in Shanghai. Chief of General Staff Chen recently sent a telegram ordering Shanghai Garrison District Commander Fu to be responsible for supervising and assessing, and if his cadres commit embezzlement, abuse, or malpractice against the new recruits, the garrison district is allowed to detain and report the situation according to the severity of the circumstances.

### Pregnant Woman Gives Birth on Train, Falls to the Ground with a Cry, Everyone Is Delighted

[Report from this newspaper] A single pregnant woman boarded the 75th Xihu second and third class regional train on the Beijing-Shanghai line at 7:00 AM on the 13th of this month when it passed through Suzhou Station. The woman's surname is Jiang, from Suzhou, her husband's name is Shen Hongchun, living at No. 131 Yunnan Middle Road, Shanghai. She had recently returned to Ningbo and, knowing that her delivery date was near, was urgently preparing to return to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, not long after the train started, the pregnant woman cried out in pain. Passengers on the train offered condolences. Two female passengers, seeing this situation, asked and learned that the woman was full-term and knew that she was about to give birth. They discussed it with the conductor and helped Shen Jiang to the rear carriage, which was more sheltered from the wind, and the passengers gave up their seats so that she could recline on the chairs. The pregnant woman cried out in pain frequently. The railway police accompanying the train searched all the carriages for an obstetrician and midwife, but to no avail. At about 8:00 AM, as the train approached Weiting Station, the pregnant woman's abdominal pain worsened. When it stopped at Zhengyi Station, they urgently sent a station attendant to summon a midwife. Before the midwife arrived, the woman let out a cry, and the baby fell to the ground with a cry. After a while, the midwife arrived and examined the pregnant woman's health, and both mother and child were safe. The passengers on the train congratulated each other. Everyone was delighted. When the train arrived at Kunshan Station, two unknown passengers on the train helped the pregnant woman and the baby to the Qinghui Clinic for examination.

The railway bureau, due to this incident, notified station personnel to pay attention at all times and to prohibit pregnant women from taking the train to avoid danger.

### Tragedy in Nanshi Fire: Seven People Killed or Injured Under the Wheels

[Report from this newspaper] Han Zhongxiang, who lived in a bungalow at No. 8, Xin Jianli, Xiaoximen, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi, was in the wax board business. At about 8:00 PM last night, he accidentally started a fire while melting sandalwood with gasoline, which spread to the houses on both sides. The Nanshi Central District and South District fire brigades rushed to the scene to put out the fire. In total, three bungalows were burned down. At the time, the Xin Kaihe Fire Department also dispatched two pump trucks. One truck, driven by driver Shou Xigong, was heading south, passing Xiaodongmen and Xiaonanmen, and when it reached the entrance of Tianshengtang Chinese Pharmacy at No. 879 Zhonghua Road, a rickshaw with the number 10906 was blocking the way, and a tricycle with the number 15753 was coming head-on. Shou Xigong swerved to avoid them, and crashed into many people enjoying the cool air, killing and injuring them. A girl, Zhang Guohua, was run over and killed.

### Qingpu Fifteen Deng Case: Family Members Protest at the High Court, Demanding Death Sentences, Ordering Them to Say Where the Bodies Are Buried

[Report from this newspaper] Zou Baoxian, the former head of Xi'an Township in Qingpu County, and Yu Kesheng, the head of Xiaoyin Township, were responsible for the brutal murder of fifteen people, including Yuan Liu, residents of northern Jiangsu, on February 28, 1945. The High Court previously sentenced Zou Baoxian, the principal offender, to life imprisonment for the crime of treason and murder, and the accessory offenders Yang Ada and Xue Shunde are still at large. The families of the victims also filed a civil lawsuit, which the District Court ruled in their favor, awarding compensation of 131.1 million yuan and allowing provisional execution.

After the families of the victims received the District Court's judgment the day before yesterday, because the bodies of all the defendants have not yet been found, dozens of them gathered yesterday morning and protested at the High Court. Starting at 9:00 AM, they knelt and cried at the entrance of the High Court, holding incense in their hands and shouting for justice, attracting a large crowd of onlookers. The court police tried to dissuade them to no avail, and for a time the traffic on North Zhejiang Road was blocked.

### Concerning Allegations of Corruption: Executive Headquarters Issues Statement of Facts, Claiming All Transactions Have Receipts and Accounting Records to Prove

Yesterday, the spokesperson for the Executive Headquarters (行總) issued a written statement of "True Facts" in response to recent reports concerning allegations of corruption within the Headquarters. The full text is as follows: "A certain news agency's so-called accusations against this office first stated that "only a little over 10,000 electric fans were actually distributed, while the Headquarters' purchasing and sales office reported selling over 20,000, meaning over 10,000 were embezzled by corrupt individuals." It is important to note that the electric fans recently sold by this office's purchasing and sales office were surplus US Navy ship fans. The United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) joint distribution conference deemed them unsuitable for market demand, fearing that individual retail sales would be unsuccessful. It was resolved to advertise for bids. After three public advertisements, only 500 units were sold, and the second and third advertisements received no bids.

Stopped Selling Electric Fans

To clear the accumulated stock, a trial retail sale was advertised. Due to the low price, only 400,000 yuan per unit, buyers rushed to purchase them, causing overcrowding and disorder at the sales locations. Over 500 letters were also received from various institutions requesting purchases. To avoid the commotion, this office decided to halt retail sales and instead distribute them free of charge to relevant institutions in need. A total of 1,800 units were distributed to the Ministry of Transportation, 2,000 to various hospitals, and over 7,600 were sold at retail locations. The remaining small quantities were distributed free of charge, all documented with distribution slips. At the time, the sudden halt to retail sales caused dissatisfaction, leading to rumors. The Office of the Comptroller has dispatched personnel to investigate, and the truth should be clarified soon. As for the claim that "the China Merchants Bureau requested 200 units, but the office forced them to change the application to 300 units, while only actually providing 200," the China Merchants Bureau has records to prove it, and this office does not need to respond.

Cotton-for-Yarn Issue

(2) Regarding the so-called "cotton-for-yarn issue," this office sold United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) American cotton to various manufacturers. The Executive Yuan approved a method of exchanging cotton for yarn spun by the manufacturers. This office, in conjunction with the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) and the Economic Department's Textile Control Committee, decided, based on the actual raw material needs for spinning yarn and the labor costs and market prices of cotton and yarn, to exchange 760 pounds of foreign cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count Zhangjiang yarn. Since this was established, it has been filed with the Executive Yuan and has been followed as precedent. As for the claim that accounting entries do not match the regulations, the actual quantity of goods received by each factory is based on the weight slips. The claim that 90 pounds fell into the hands of corrupt individuals is simply unfounded.

Wheat-to-Flour Ratio

(3) The so-called technical issue of water seeping into wheat is practically impossible. This office receives American wheat from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) and entrusts it to various flour mills such as Shanghai Fuxin for milling into uniform flour. The regulation stipulates that 100 jin of American wheat should yield 90 jin of uniform flour and 8 jin of bran, with the remaining 2 jin being the mill's processing loss. This flour yield ratio and moisture content percentage are determined by experts from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總). The flour produced must undergo regular and direct spot checks by experts from the United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總). There have been no instances of excessive moisture content. If the moisture content were to increase, the flour would quickly mold and clump. The factories still have flour in storage that has not molded over time, which proves the facts and requires no further explanation. The rumor that "five jin of water are added per shi, and the five jin surplus is embezzled through corruption" is self-defeating.

Transportation Costs Had Discounts

(4) The so-called transportation kickbacks are purely based on misunderstanding. The materials handled by this office are for relief purposes, so discount measures for reduced transportation costs were negotiated with various transportation agencies. All state-run and private Chinese shipping companies transporting materials for this office charged 75% of the China Merchants Bureau's freight rates. Railway freight rates were also calculated at 75% until the end of October last year. Since November of last year, they have been calculated at a special contract price of 45 yuan per ton-kilometer, which increased to 135 yuan in July of this year. The so-called discount is not a commission but a reduction in transportation fees charged to this office by the carrier, in accordance with regulations, to reduce the expenses of this office.

Housing, Refrigerators, Coal

(5) The house at 570 Jian Guo West Road is the residence for the director and deputy director of this office and is not solely occupied by Deputy Director Li Zhuomin's family. The refrigerator inside the house is a relic from the previous owner and is not a United Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (聯總) item. Ordinary staff dormitories of this office are assigned managers and servants. The Jian Guo West Road residence usually only has five workers. The rumor that "Deputy Director Li refused to allocate funds to assist in the Guangdong disaster but instead squeezed 500 million yuan to rent dormitories for staff" clearly lacks factual basis. The 500 million yuan for the Guangdong disaster relief has already been remitted to Guangdong. This office has never used 500 million yuan to rent housing.

Vehicles are for Public Use

Furthermore, the news agency's report involved Hu Keshi, director of the Fisheries Management Office. Director Hu was only appointed to take over the Fisheries Management Office last week, having been in office for less than a week. As for the claim that "General Affairs Director Xu Shichang has as many as three private cars," it is a misunderstanding referring to the official vehicles managed by the General Affairs Office. Mr. Xu does not have any private cars, and the municipal government's Public Utilities Bureau's license records can be checked. This office has detailed receipts and accounting records to verify all of the above. The administration of this office generally follows the principle of layered responsibility, and each level of staff is responsible for their own administrative responsibilities. We sincerely hope that the supervisory authorities will come to this office to investigate separately to clarify the facts." It is noted that before taking over the Fisheries Management Office, Hu Keshi was the previous director of the General Affairs Office of the Executive Headquarters.

### Prosecutors Visit the Executive Headquarters Yesterday, Offices Quiet and Desolate

[Report from our newspaper] The preliminary investigation into the case of alleged corruption by Executive Headquarters Deputy Director Li Zhuomin and others was initially disregarded by the District Prosecutor's Office because it was an anonymous letter. However, yesterday morning, Executive Headquarters Director Huo Zishu, in order to clarify the true facts, sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office requesting that personnel be dispatched to investigate. The letter stated that it was a disgruntled dismissed employee making the accusations. Chief Prosecutor Huang dispatched Prosecutors He Huimin and Zhang Yuanzhen to conduct a thorough investigation yesterday morning. At 3 PM yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor He Huimin, accompanied by Secretary Wu Chengji and two bailiffs, arrived at the Executive Headquarters but was stopped by the gatekeeper, who stated that the office was closed for the afternoon and requested that they return another day. Prosecutor He explained the purpose of their visit, entered and inspected the office for a week, and saw that except for the gatekeeper, there was not a single person present. Since no one greeted them, they did not sit down to rest and left after staying for about three minutes. Prosecutor He plans to return to investigate again tomorrow morning.

[Another Dispatch] Executive Headquarters Director Huo sent Chief Secretary Lu Hanqin to visit Comptroller Yan Zhuang yesterday morning to explain the matter of someone anonymously accusing senior Executive Headquarters officials of group corruption, and expressed welcome for the Comptroller to dispatch personnel to investigate.

It is also reported that Comptroller Yan told reporters afterward that the anonymous accuser had a real name and address, suggesting that it was not a malicious accusation.

[Report from our newspaper] Zhou Xingfa, a 29-year-old man from Fenghua, works in the banking industry and has a good income and no family burdens, so he has accumulated some savings. In the spring of this year, Zhou met a young woman named Dong Xiaofeng through a friend's introduction. They went out together several times and their affection deepened.

On May 3rd, they held a wedding in Shanghai with a hall full of guests. However, three days after the wedding, Zhou returned home from work and suddenly found that his home was empty, not only were all the clothes and accessories gone, but even the wedding certificate and both rings were missing. At this time, Zhou realized that he had fallen into the "White Wolf" scheme arranged by Dong Yinshi and lost both his person and property. He filed a complaint with the District Court, accusing Dong Yinshi of fraud and stated that if Dong's daughter were harbored, he would file charges of theft and fraud separately.

### Fuzhou Reporters Arrive in Gutian to Visit Hydroelectric Power Project

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 16th] The Fuzhou reporters recently went to Gutian, northern Fujian, at the invitation of the Provincial Government, to visit the Gutian Creek Hydroelectric Power Project, and returned to Fuzhou late last night. The roads in northern Fujian are badly damaged, with much of the road surface washed away by mountain floods. The reporters traveled 136 kilometers in a jeep, reaching their destination after a bumpy ride. Banditry in Gutian is rampant. A certain branch of the Communist bandits' Peace and National Salvation Army, led by Zuo Fengmei, with over 200 men and guns, is roaming the border of the county and recently looted four granaries. The reporters even heard the sound of fierce fighting between soldiers and bandits when they were about to reach the county seat. Under the guidance of the project personnel, the reporters set out on foot along mountain paths and sheep trails to Guise and Cao Yang to visit the hydroelectric power project and the diversion section of the Longting Waterfall. The Longting Waterfall is located in a deep mountain valley, with spray splashing high like a thin mist. The county's waterfall spray is a spectacular sight. The project is massive. When completed in the future, it will be a major driving force for the industrialization of Fujian Province.

### Early Rice Harvesting Season Arrives, Fujian Province Rushes to Collect Delinquent Taxes

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 12th] The Fujian Provincial Government believes that the accumulated tax arrears of various counties are quite large. Now that the early rice harvest is underway, the opportunity should be seized to intensify the collection efforts. It has specifically approved four measures, ordering all counties to collect all outstanding taxes by the end of August. Households with outstanding taxes who continue to resist and delay payment, regardless of their identity or background, will be handed over to the judicial authorities for investigation in accordance with the law. Clearing old debts will greatly facilitate the opening of new taxes.

### Fujian Police Security Office Cracks Down on Bandit Gangs

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch, 12th] Bandit gangs are rampant in the border areas and coastal areas of Fujian Province. Notable ones include Liu Yongsheng's gang in western Fujian, Chen Gu Lao's gang in northern Fujian, Huang Guojing's gang in eastern Fujian, and Chen Hengyuan's gang in southern Fujian. They gather and disperse from time to time, ravaging the local areas, or harassing township offices, or attacking granaries, or intercepting boats and vehicles, greatly affecting public safety. The Provincial Police Security Office should specifically divide the counties where banditry is active into three suppression zones and eight self-defense zones, equip police security brigades (i.e., the original security teams) to vigorously suppress them, and mobilize local forces to build bunkers and defensive works to prevent bandit raids. After four-sided encirclement and suppression, the main force of each bandit gang has shown signs of collapse.

### Shi Fuhai Brutally Murdered in Tianjin, Russian Suspect Lai Chai Confesses Unreservedly

[Our Tianjin Dispatch] Shi Fuhai, the Chinese manager of the Shanghai China Continental Machinery Company (31 years old, from Nanjing), and Lai Chai, the deputy manager of the company (Soviet, 24 years old), brought a batch of new sewing machine documents from Shanghai to Tianjin on the 14th of last month for promotion. On the morning of August 8th, Shi was suddenly murdered in the Tailai Hotel, a first-class inn where he was staying in Tianjin. The murderer has been identified as Lai Chai, who came with Shi. When the bloody case occurred (3 AM on the 8th), Wang Zhiping, a student at the Shenyang Second Institute of Technology, and his wife Guo Yufen, who were staying in Room 106 next to Shi Fuhai's Room 105 in the Tailai Hotel, were suddenly awakened from their sleep by a noise from next door and heard someone cry "Ah!" Then there was no more sound. At the same time, Zheng Suzhen, an actress staying in Room 104 next door, was also awakened by the screams. She specifically looked out the window at the street but found nothing, so she did not pay any further attention. At 7 AM, Lai Chai came from outside with a bottle of half milk and a piece of bread, and called the tea boy to open Room 105 and enter. He saw that Shi Fuhai had died on the bed, and dropped the milk and bread he was holding to the ground, cried out, and went straight to the Tenth Police Station to report the case.

When the police station received Lai Chai's report, they immediately found bloodstains on Lai Chai's clothes and hands. After a thorough examination, they saw scratches on Lai Chai's left ear, arm, and right cheek, bloodstains on his left leg, front abdomen, and hands, a red mark on his right palm as if he had been holding something tightly, knife wounds on his left middle finger, index finger, and arm, and a new cone-shaped wound on the lower back of his right leg. When questioned about his whereabouts, he stammered and looked flustered. The police station immediately determined that Lai Chai was highly suspicious and detained him for detailed interrogation. Lai Chai finally confessed to murdering Shi Fuhai unreservedly. The local authorities are still reviewing how Lai Chai will be handled.

Shi Fuhai was a Muslim. After the police station buried his body, the Shanghai Muslim Association telegraphed the Ping Muslim Association to ask the Tianjin branch to request the police station's permission to move Shi's remains to the Tianjin Muslim Cemetery. All this is waiting for Shi Fuhai's father to come to Tianjin from Shanghai to take care of the matter. It is learned that Shi and Lai Chai had been at odds for a long time. After they arrived in Tianjin, Shi Hai's father and wife frequently sent letters from Shanghai, asking Shi to be strictly on guard against Lai Chai, but in the end, he could not avoid this tragedy.

### Another Key Criminal Arrested in the Shanyang Ban Case

### Police Headquarters - Inside the Criminal Experiment Laboratory - The Mysterious Nine Groups · Agile Performances - The Lie Detector Enough to Make Criminals Tremble - Police Dogs Can Search Out Hidden Matchboxes

[Our Beijing Correspondent Ding Yuan, 15th] Criminal police are extremely common in European and American countries, but in China it is still a pioneering endeavor. As the name implies, criminal police are still in the "experimental" stage, and even this experiment has only been in existence for a year. When the Ministry of Interior's Police Headquarters was established on August 15th last year, under the leadership of Director Tang Zong, the Criminal Experiment Case began receiving equipment from the former Sino-American Cooperative Organization and transporting it to Nanjing.

The primary task of the criminal police is the prevention and investigation of crimes, with the collection and identification of evidence as the first step. In today's era of scientific advancement, criminals' techniques are increasing daily, so the collection and identification of evidence must rely on the coordination of scientific equipment and technology. Sadly, the equipment in the criminal experiment laboratory, although keeping around two hundred police officers busy, is only the size of a state police department in the United States. At best, this equipment is only sufficient for Jiangsu Province, but how does our province's transportation compare to that of a state in the United States? Currently, this equipment is still the only one in the entire country. In a place like Shanghai, where there are countless criminal incidents every day, if this set of equipment could be moved to Shanghai for use, it is believed that it would definitely prevent some crimes from happening or allow crimes to be solved quickly. Wasn't the cracking of the gold broker Yu Shengxiao's case due to the effectiveness of the criminal police equipment?

From 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. on the 15th,

Director Tang Zong hosted judicial and press figures closely related to the police to visit the Criminal Experiment Laboratory, as a commemoration of the first anniversary of the establishment of the Police Headquarters. Under the guidance of many responsible personnel, we successively visited eight groups, including physical and chemical, technical, electrical, photographic, fingerprint, forensic, and police dog groups. Only the police pigeon group was not visited. These nine groups constitute the foundation of the Criminal Experiment Laboratory. At one moment, we seemed to be walking into a hospital, and at another, we were entering a physical and chemical laboratory. The responsible personnel spoke while wiping the beads of sweat from their foreheads. The air was fresh, the layout was neat, and the staff in each room wore white uniforms, much like doctors in a hospital. It is worth noting that the balance in the physical and chemical group has an accuracy of one ten-thousandth. When the experiment is in progress,

even a single strand of hair shows its weight on the balance. This is prepared for measuring the slightest poisons. The technical group has a lie detector, which is something that can make criminals tremble. The principle of lie detection is based on the relationship between the electrical reactions and the psychological and physiological aspects of the human body. The lie detector's effectiveness is usually 75 percent, but the experience and knowledge of the lie detector operator are very important. It is said that there are only two machines in the world, one here and one in the United States. The electrical group's tape recorder is for preventing criminals from retracting their confessions. The recording is done on the spot and can be played back immediately. Deputy Minister Tao Xisheng was invited by the group in charge to give a five-minute speech on evidence collection and identification. A minute later, we heard him speaking there for the second time. The photographic group's X-ray equipment is lightweight and can be moved and transported at any time, suitable for taking photos at the "scene." The "comparison microscope" in the firearms examination group can determine whether a shell casing or bullet and a suspected firearm are suspicious. Under

microscopic photography, the lines on the bullet or shell casing become ironclad evidence. The equipment in the fingerprint group is now widely used. Here, there is a more special device, which is a corpse fingerprinting box. The fingers of a corpse are stiff and cannot be imprinted, but three kinds of chemicals make the fingerprints of a corpse indistinguishable from those of a living person.

The police dog section put on a "live performance." These police dogs are well-trained. They can rescue police officers by biting through the ropes that bind people. They can perform a "field search" and find a suitcase containing opium in many pieces of luggage. They can carry out "criminal tracking" and, based on the footprints on the route, they can even find a matchbox picked up by a stranger. The police dogs' performance was very interesting and left a deep impression on the visitors.

This equipment can be described as a "dragnet." No matter how skillfully you commit a crime, you will hardly escape the nets set by these instruments and equipment that supplement human power. Now, Director Tang Zong has the

ambition to expand the equipment. He hopes to distribute criminal police to various places so that the crimes most likely to occur in society will be greatly reduced due to the widespread presence of criminal police. Who is willing to test the law? No item in the criminal experiment laboratory will let go of criminals.

After visiting the Criminal Experiment Laboratory for two hours, seeing the various pieces of equipment and instruments, and hearing the various explanations and descriptions, when the last program was completed, I thought to myself: "From now on, people who break the law will definitely not dare to break the law."

Reducing crime is a kind of social progress. I hope that the Police Headquarters will have greater success in the field of criminal police.

### All Levels of Schools and Social Education Institutions - Expand the Scientific Movement - The Ministry of Education Orders Implementation on This Year's National Day

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Ministry of Education has formulated "Key Points for Expanding the Scientific Movement in Schools and Social Education Institutions at All Levels." It has recently ordered all provinces and cities to comply and implement the expanded scientific movement on this year's National Day.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] This question concerns national colleges and universities and other educational institutions. I have recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to expand the scientific movement every Double Tenth Festival. Schools at all levels should have special topics at that time, hold lectures and exhibitions, and open various scientific facilities. All social education institutions should expand publicity, screen movies, hold picture exhibitions, and publish special issues.

### Cry of Peking University Professor - Professor's Children Cannot Afford Books - Salary Only Sustains Half a Month's Household Expenses

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, at last night's tea party with Peking University professors, responded to the issue of improving treatment by saying: The government has decided to follow the example of Beijing and Shanghai and distribute goods in kind in nine cities. The first to start will be Tianjin and Beiping this month. If there are insufficient materials in Tianjin and Beiping, the difference between the market price will be issued first. Zhu said that of the additional improvement and expansion funds, only six universities nationwide received 2.5 billion, that is, Peking University, Tsinghua, Central, Zhongshan, Zhejiang, and Wuhan. The 18 billion requested by Peking University is truly beyond its means. Hu Shi spoke twice, saying that the call for this kind of cry from Peking University professors is not focused on money, but on hoping to maintain the professors' dedication to their careers. Zhou Binglin said that the current salary can only sustain a family of four for half a month, and the professor's children can no longer afford books. Zhao Naiju urged Zhu to pay attention to the difference in the rate of price increases and salaries.

### Zhu Jiahua Will Fly to Tianjin and Then to Shenyang Tomorrow

Was Surrounded by Students Again Yesterday - Accepted Charity Sale of Pastries for 3 Million

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] Education Minister Zhu Jiahua will continue to inspect various cultural and educational institutions today and is quite busy. He inspected Chaoyang and Tsinghua in the morning. He inspected Yanjing in the afternoon and attended the board meeting of the Palace Museum. He attended a banquet held by the college and the Beiping Research Institute in the evening. At 9 p.m., he attended a banquet with professors from the Teachers College to discuss the issue of the Teachers College's restoration. On the 17th, he will attend the memorial service for Shen Jianshi and then visit the Summer Palace. He is scheduled to fly to Tianjin by special plane on the 18th, stay for a few hours, and then fly to Shenyang. When Zhu inspected Tsinghua today, he was surrounded by students again. First, during a conversation with President Mei Yiqi, student representatives from Tsinghua's Student Aid Movement Committee presented two pieces of millet cake and a cup of ice cream, seeking to raise 3 million through charity sales.

### The Government Will Adopt a Subsidy System to Rescue the Export Industry Crisis

Subsidy Measures Under Review by the Executive Yuan

Since the difference between the official exchange rate and the black market price emerged, the export industry has suffered a severe blow and has fallen into a state of stagnation. To rescue the export industry crisis, the government has adopted a purchasing policy to promote exports. However, the targets of the purchase are limited to seven major commodities, including tung oil, bristles, tea, silk, eggs, and wool. For export commodities other than these seven, the Export Promotion Council has formulated specific measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan is currently reviewing them. It is heard that the principle has been decided to adopt a subsidy system, allowing merchants to export independently. This is because government officials believe that seeking a balance of international payments and encouraging exports are the only important issues at present. Therefore, anyone who can export should be assisted to export in order to earn foreign exchange, which is the biggest goal. For commodities other than the seven major ones, the adoption of subsidy measures is entirely aimed at obtaining foreign exchange. It is generally believed that if this is implemented, China's international trade will have a turning point, and it will be of great help to the balance of international payments.

Then, as Tianjin, Hubei, and Guangdong buyers bought at low prices, and local demand was also more active, large sellers adhered to the principle of not selling special goods, while small sellers bought low and sold high.

### Fuel Management Committee Met Yesterday to Discuss Accelerating Coal Transportation

The Fuel Management Committee invited the Beijing-Shanghai, Ping-Han, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railways, as well as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Municipal Public Works Bureau, to hold a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of accelerating coal transportation. According to the committee, in the past, about 150,000 tons of coal were transported to Shanghai each month, of which about 50,000 tons came from Taiwan and 100,000 tons came from the Kailuan Coal Mine. As of now this month, more than 70,000 tons of coal have been transported to Shanghai. Due to the strengthening of the Beijing-Ningbo Railway transportation, the amount of Kailuan coal transported to Shanghai can be increased to 150,000 tons starting this month. Mr. Sun, director of the Unified Distribution Office of the committee, estimates that the amount of coal distributed in this city this winter can be increased by 20,000 tons per month compared to the current amount, that is, 170,000 tons, so there is no need to worry about the coal shortage. In addition, after the Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other places in the Yangtze River region were allowed to purchase coal freely, coal has been continuously transported to Shanghai from various places. Recently, coal merchants in this city transported 20,000 tons of coal from Wuhan to Shanghai, which may be the main reason for the recent sluggish coal prices. In addition, the third batch of civil coal in this city will be distributed by the committee in late this month, and the amount is still 5,000 tons.

### Raw Silk Exports Suffer Heavy Losses

According to relevant sources, all kinds of Chinese export goods are subject to losses when sold abroad. For example, calculated on the basis of bristles, tung oil, and casings, the difference is about 50%, tea is about 100%, and the price difference for raw silk is even greater. Taking this year's spring cocoon yarn cost of about 38.5 million yuan per dan as an example, although there are transactions in foreign sales, the price is very low. For those with five to ten dan or more, each pound is about 5 US dollars. With each dan weighing 133 pounds, converted at the official exchange rate of 12,000 yuan, each dan is only worth more than 7.9 million national currency. For transactions of more than 100 dan, each pound is only worth more than 3 US dollars. On average, calculated at 4 US dollars per pound, each group of raw silk exports must lose at least 600%. This year's spring cocoon loan was 160 billion yuan, the reeling worker loan was 100 billion yuan, plus interest and 10% of the manufacturers' advance, the total amount is about 490 billion yuan. The total silk production is 14,000 bundles, and the cost of each bundle is 38.5 million yuan. Converted at the foreign selling price of 4 US dollars per pound, each dan is only worth more than 6 million yuan. Therefore, the total cost of 490 billion yuan can only recover more than 80 billion yuan at the selling price, and it is not known when it can be sold out. Even in terms of the raw silk purchased by the government last year, only more than 1,000 dan have been shipped to the United States for sale by the China Trust Bureau to date. As for the autumn cocoon loan, the authorities have not yet approved it. If calculated at a silk production of 8,000 dan and a cost of 38.5 million yuan per dan, the total amount of funds required is about 310 billion yuan. Therefore, the total cost of spring and autumn cocoon reeling silk reaches a huge 800 billion yuan. The rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Kunming cities, the spring silk cocoon loans are again flowing into the cities, which is a major factor affecting price increases. Therefore, the authorities are conducting a detailed study of this.

### Before the Executive Yuan's Approval Arrives, Artificial Silk Temporarily Maintains Last Week's List Price, Silk Weaving Industry Petition Representatives Have Returned to Shanghai

[Our Correspondent] The China Trust Bureau's artificial silk allocation price was passed by the bureau's business executives' meeting yesterday, and it was decided that before the Executive Yuan's approval arrives, the list price of last week will be temporarily maintained. That is, Dongyang Dafugui is 22.4 million yuan, and others such as Tianqiao, Gaoshan, and Jinbenma are still 22.3 million yuan.

It is also reported that the silk weaving industry's petition representatives Cai Xintao, Liu Qingyi, and others have returned to Shanghai from Beijing. According to Cai and others, the central authorities have expressed great sympathy for the request to reduce the allocation price of artificial silk and agreed to consider the various items submitted and instructed them to return to Shanghai first to contact the China Trust Bureau. It was originally intended to go to the China Trust Bureau for negotiations yesterday, but because Wu Rencang has not yet returned to Shanghai, it will be changed to Monday. At that time, the two sides will conduct a detailed review, and a solution may be obtained.

Artificial Silk Turns Prosperous

It is also reported that the artificial silk market is sluggish, but morale has turned prosperous, and it has risen again in the afternoon. In the morning, No. 120 Gaoshan Youguang opened at 25.7 million yuan, and closed at 6 million yuan at noon. There was no change in the afternoon, and the most students even quoted 6.5 million yuan. The official market price was 6.2 million yuan, which was 500,000 yuan higher than the daily price.

Factory Management is Stable

The factory management market was quite stable yesterday morning, but due to the Saturday relationship, the quotes were all 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. High uniformity is still lacking in inquiries, and the transaction price of another dan of goods is the same as the previous day. The eight hearts are more expensive in the afternoon, and the quotes have increased again compared to the morning, but there are no formal transactions. Silk prices fall back

Silk goods and bed covers have been flying high for several days. The market fell back yesterday. Huakang goods were transacted at 490,000 and 500,000 yuan after the market opened, with a five0,000 yuan premium for Monday. Later, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, it fell step by step, and the smallest spot price was 430,000 yuan. After 9 o'clock, it rose again, returning to the original market price at the opening. Finally, due to more selling, it fell again, and the closing price was 450,000 yuan, with a 490,000 yuan premium for Monday, a drop of more than 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Dazhen goods were about 100,000 yuan more expensive than Huakang goods. Lattice crepe was quoted at 4,500 yuan, but there was little success.

### Chinese Medicine Weakens

Chinese medicine was once strong, but due to sluggish sales, customers added allocations, the amounts were small, and they were not in full pieces, which led to a return to weakness. People in the industry felt very depressed, and the market transactions were extremely lonely, a dullness that has not been seen in previous years.

### Market Rumors Abound, Chinese Stocks Weaken and Then Strengthen

Chinese stocks were temporarily weak yesterday. After the North Gang's young and strong factions and the securities gang's active multi-party additions, the situation changed after some effort. The empty side was forced to cover, so rumors abounded, and the stock market emerged, leaving material objects and advancing alone. Except for China Feng Enamel, which was affected by a certain dispute, the special stock panicked and went from bad to worse, falling by more than 15%. The rest of the stocks advanced uniformly, and business even rose to the limit. In the afternoon, the unofficial over-the-counter trading continued to call high, and the rumors about foreign exchange and currency systems were even more prevalent.

At the morning opening, inheriting the remaining wind from the previous closing and affected by the difference in the national bank, the opening was much lower. After the opening of Di Yongsha, it was still oppressed by floating long positions, and the current prices were all at a low of 220 yuan. Nos. 97, 186, 16, and 85 had buyers, and a slight increase was seen. No. 235 took advantage of the high price to close. Very few transactions were made, and the market atmosphere was still difficult to boost. After 9:30, through the purchase of current Yongsha by Nos. 186, 226, and 177, Nos. 23, 224, 16, 94, and 32 all entered, and it rose back to 227 yuan and 230 yuan. Nos. 235, 83, 158, and 219 sold out, still falling to 225 yuan. Nos. 223, 16, 117, 186, 85, 76, 105, 36, 207, and 158 still had strong buying intentions, and Nos. 163 and 232 also entered the current Yongsha. After 10:30, No. 163, a young and strong faction, made efforts to pull up, and a squeeze was launched.

After 11 o'clock, Yongsha stepped up to 235 yuan and 236 yuan, and Meiya also got the purchase of Nos. 149 and 95 and was also pulled up. No. 130 took advantage of the high price to close, and the current Yongsha Nos. 207 and 186 also sold out, turning lower slightly, but because the morale was already good, rumors of foreign exchange adjustment and free gold buying and selling spread, Nos. 32, 4, 24, 163, 117, 89, and 8 re-entered, and Nos. 163 and 157 bought the current Yongsha. At 11:20, business was pulled up to the limit by No. 157, and Yongsha also rose to a high price of 236 yuan and 240 yuan. Only China Feng had special unfavorable news, and the holders panicked. No. 147 tried to sell the current China Feng, and the downward trend was strengthened instead. Before the close, Nos. 76, 235, 14, 112, 157, and 18 took advantage of the high price to close, falling back to 230 yuan and 232 yuan. No. 163 still included the current Yongsha. The current Yongsha closed at 234 yuan at noon, and the delivery Yongsha closed at 232 yuan, forming an inverted hanging.

The shouting price was stable after the close, but in the afternoon, there were those who jumped to 245 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, the current delivery stocks Yongsha, Meiya, Xinguang, Yonggong, and Qinxing rose slightly, China France fell by half a percentage point, Xinhua was flat, China Feng fell sharply by 15%, business rose to the limit, and Jingfu was still flat. Xinya rose by half a percentage point, and the remaining stocks all reported a slight increase. The delivery stocks included Yongsha, Meiya, Xinguang, Qinxing, and Jingfu, which rose slightly, and China Feng, which fell by 15%. Among the over-the-counter old stocks, Nanyang, Zhabei, Dasheng, and Hua Gao rose the most, and the remaining stocks also showed prosperity.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks are Mediocre

Public bonds went through a mediocre and accumulating fatigue yesterday. Miscellaneous brands were slightly stable. Unified C opened at 13,000 yuan, with a high price of 13,400 yuan and a low price of 12,500 yuan, and then ended at around 12,700 yuan. Rooms 552 and 555 entered miscellaneous brands, and Runde entered Unified C), Room 503 sold slightly, and the transaction was about 7 million. As a result, compared to the previous closing, A and B fell slightly by 100 yuan, C fell by 400 yuan, Unified D was flat, and Unified E also fell by 200 yuan.

Foreign stocks did not rise much yesterday. There was no direct stimulus, such as the Hong Kong exchange rate being very mediocre, so the buying wind was not very strong. Securities gangs and others included, Yisha, British Union Paper, Yipi, Yu Ye rose slightly, Ye Guang fell slightly, and Huide was flat.

### Non-Commercial Postal Packages Under $50 USD Can be Exempted From Import Permits

### Timber Market Conditions

Yesterday, cedar wood rose sharply, and large strips rose by as much as 300 yuan compared to the previous day. Now that the Shanghai-Min communications are unimpeded, and as the Shanghai market rises, the Min market also follows.

### Fan Talk

— Yi Feng

Since the Ming Dynasty, those made in Suzhou and Sichuan have been the best. In the autocratic era, the dragon, phoenix, and hundred birds symbolized the monarch

Fans are divided into round fans and folding fans. The name for fans, Guan Yi Dong is called "　", and Guan Yi Xi is called "fan".

Round fans were invented very early, and the era cannot be verified; while folding fans only appeared after the Yuan Dynasty, and their origin came from Goryeo. It was treated as collateral and flowed into China. However, at that time, the name was "Jutou Fan", because it was convenient to hide in the sleeves, it gradually became popular after the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty.

The fans of the Ming Dynasty were mostly decorated with gold powder, that is, the ones bestowed by the emperor to his ministers, and their faces were also made of gold. It was not until after Emperor Xianzong of the Ming Dynasty that calligraphy and painting were done on the fan surface. If sellers of ancient calligraphy and paintings today use fan-shaped folding pages to falsely claim that they are works by famous public figures in the early Ming Dynasty and wait for the price to sell, then they are definitely fake products. Fortunately, buyers should not be fooled.

Since then, those made in Suzhou and Sichuan have been the best. In the autocratic era, the dragon, phoenix, and hundred birds symbolized the monarch and empress, so the fans used in the palace at that time had their bones and faces decorated with Zhenglong, Cenlong, Hundred Dragons, or Hundred Birds, which were very brilliant and spectacular. However, the price was also extremely expensive, with one handle worth several gold. Some people even became famous for making fans, such as Ma Xun, Ma Fu, Shen Shaolou, and Jiang Sutai, who were mostly praised as famous masters in the Ming Dynasty.

During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, the ones contributed from various places that were appreciated by the Emperor included the Jinling Yangshi fan and the Yishi plain paper fan; then there were the Qingyang fan, the Wuling gauze fan, and the Cao Miao, 靴鼠, and Liyang opera fan. Now that we have reached the present day, round fans made of banana leaves are still popular with ordinary laborers. Although folding fans are beautiful, "benevolent wind fans are raised", after all, round fans are more practical.

The ancients often painted beautiful women with fans in their paintings, which shows that there is also an indissoluble bond between fans and beauties. Those who use fans in poetry have the sentence "light silk small fan flicks fireflies", which is very beautifully depicted. However, "autumn fan is abandoned" refers to the aging of beauty.

### Fans and Women

— Donglai

Friends who have read Wang Wilde's "Lady Windermere's Fan" and Kong Shangren's "The Peach Blossom Fan" and other plays will understand even more the influence and significance of fans on women.

In fact, as early as the Han Dynasty, there was Ban Jieyu's poem about round fans, the so-called "discarded in the basket, love is cut off in the middle", which has long become the story of the abandoned autumn fan in later generations. During the Jin Dynasty, there was also a Wang Min who often held a white round fan to cover his shame because he had an affair with his sister-in-law's maidservant. The maidservant gave him a white round fan and sang: "Round fan, round fan, allow me to hold it to cover my face. Haggard and no longer groomed, ashamed to meet my lover." Fans have the wonderful use of covering shame in addition to fanning the wind, no wonder shy women like to carry fans with them; and the various roles of 生旦净丑 on the stage have various different fans to help them pose.

The most romantic stories about fans and women, there is a story about a gold-painted fan in my hometown, passed down by word of mouth. At the end of the former Qing Dynasty, a wealthy official married several concubines, some from Suzhou, some from Yangzhou, and some from Beijing. The concubine from Beijing fell in love with an actor and secretly gave the master's most beloved gold-painted antique folding fan to the actor as a souvenir. Later, unfortunately, the master saw the fan in the actor's hand, and asked the Beijing concubine to take it, because this precious antique had always been kept by her. Under such interrogation, the adultery was naturally revealed. The master was enlightened and sent the concubine to the actor in a sedan chair overnight, ordering the two to leave the country together, and naturally the gold-painted fan was also given to them as a token of love. Afterwards, this generous master still had a poem, and I remember the last two sentences:

"Riding the wind to send you away with the person, I am willing to donate the gold-painted fan together."

This master is good at describing himself, regarding women as the same as fans, casually giving them away. In ancient times, there was a strange custom of giving concubines and maids. This master is truly "古道可风"

In the eyes of ordinary people, fans are different from women after all. Fans can be given away, but women cannot, because women have their own personality, they are not just a gift!

But one person cannot use two fans to fan the wind at the same time. Similarly, one person should not marry two wives in one room at the same time. If you use or marry one more, someone will use one less or remain a widower for life, which is not the case.

I remember when I was a child, I often used two fans to fan the wind to cool off, and my grandmother immediately forbade it, saying that it could not be fanned like this. When asked what the reason was, she refused to say. Later, I heard others tell me that this is a superstition, saying that if you use two fans to fan the wind at the same time, you will turn into a butterfly after death.

Although it is absurd, it is quite close to the taste of literature and art.

### Wind Butterfly Order

Fan

The heat makes it a necessity, but it's discarded and hidden when it's cold.  Isn't blocking half the face a novel look? A marvelous sight on the airfield: a new bride evading!

Electricity provides head-shaking rotations, while slight breezes require manual effort. Born in the same era, yet the coolness differs. Who cares about swatting flies and mosquitoes while sweat pours like syrup!  Such endeavors emerge in succession, with Chen Yunbo, a poet from Qiantang, gaining fame for his "Round Fan Poems." However, the earliest odes to fans were expressions of sentiment through objects, with writing born from emotion, hence their profound impact. Later works merely piled up words and phrases, lacking substance, at best a small decoration for so-called "men of letters" to amuse themselves.

Round fans often feature ornaments like fan pendants, usually carved from jade into various figures and playthings. Wang Yiwen's poem on Emperor Gaozong of Song says, "A thousand gold spent on a jade child." The jade child refers to the fan pendant. According to "West Lake Miscellaneous Records," "Emperor Gaozong once hosted a banquet for his ministers and saw Zhang Xunwang Jun holding a fan with a jade child pendant. The emperor recognized it as an old item, accidentally dropped into the water in Siming in the past. He asked Jun where he obtained it, and Jun replied, 'I bought it from a shop in Qinghefang.' Inquiring with the shopkeeper, he said he got it from a basket carrier. Further inquiry revealed it came from a kitchen maid in the Chen residence outside Houchaomen. The maid said she found it in the belly of a broken yellow croaker. The emperor was overjoyed. The shopkeeper and basket carrier were promoted to junior officers, and the kitchen maid was granted the title of 'Madam.'" This story is truly amusing. Emperor Gaozong thought the return of the old object was a good omen and treated the shopkeeper, basket carrier, and kitchen maid as meritorious officials who had recovered lost territory and restored the homeland, bestowing generous rewards. In reality, besides giving these peddlers a windfall, it had no other significance. If Emperor Gaozong had valued Yue Wu Mu and Han Shizhong as much as the basket carrier and kitchen maid, the return of old objects would have been more than just a jade child.

The abandonment of fans with the arrival of autumn has been a source of sorrow throughout history. However, Zhong Tui'gu's inscription on a fan box states, "Store this woman, let her rest. She says she is discarded. I say the bird sees the man, earnestly embracing him in his sleeve, able to live out his days." Thus, "the birds are gone, the good bow is stored away," is actually a blessing for the good bow. In fact, round fans have almost disappeared today, not even waiting for the autumn wind. The currently popular folding fans, commonly known as oil paper fans, can be opened and closed freely, making them convenient to carry. Lu Shen's "Random Notes from the Spring Breeze Cottage" states, "Today's folding fans, Zhang Donghai believed, benefited the Eastern barbarians, and became popular in China during the Yongle reign." The "Peng Chuang Continued Records" states the same. However, folding fans did not originate in the Ming Dynasty. Records show that they were already in use during the Southern Song Dynasty. Su Dongpo mentioned Korean white pine fans that could be unfolded to over a foot wide and folded to only two fingers, which are folding fans. Feng Fang said, "My family has a folding fan with a poem by Emperor Zhangzong of Jin," which says, "Several strands of Xiang River dragon bones are slender, cleverly designed and folded into Xiang River wrinkles." This suggests that they existed during the Song and Jin Dynasties, and became popular during the Yongle reign.

Shaoxing Zhoujia Bridge was one of the main production areas for folding fans, with eighty or ninety percent of the villagers making a living from it. The manufacturing process was highly specialized, with pay varying according to the nature of the work, but generally very low. The quality of the fans was roughly divided into several grades, with inferior ones costing a thousand or two, and superior ones costing over ten thousand. Before the war, they were sold overseas, earning huge sums of money. After the war, affected by prices, they gradually declined. The surfaces of folding fans were decorated with paintings or calligraphy. "Hangzhou Customs and Remnants" records female workers who pasted fan surfaces, saying, "The oil paper fans sent to Shandong and the northern provinces have colored paintings of figures on one side and cut-out gold characters pasted on the other. The pasting of characters is also done by female workers. Fan shops such as Shu Lian Ji and Zhang Ziyuan all distribute this work, starting around August or September. Although there is some work at other times, it is not much. The price is also relatively low, only a few coins per fan." This shows that gold leaf fans were once popular, but are no longer seen today.

Today, electric fans roar in the cities, and paper fans have little use. In the past, Fan Fanshan wrote poems about steamships, trains, telegraphs, and photographs, vividly and colorfully. It's a pity he didn't write about electric fans, perhaps because they weren't very popular at that time.

Fan Special

### Chats on Painting Fans

— Hu Yaguang

The art of painting fans also has its secrets, which should not be overlooked. Beginners often find it difficult, mainly because they are not familiar with the secrets. Now I will try to describe a few, for the reference of scholars, and as a conversation piece during tea breaks. I will write in a rambling way, hoping that those with more experience will not laugh at my shallowness, then I will be very lucky.

(1) Removing Oil: Fan surfaces often have oil stains. If the artist does not notice, the ink will not adhere easily to the oily spots, which is not elegant. There are many old methods. One is to use a small tube made of lampwick (the firmer the better), and gently wipe the area before applying ink. The oil stains will be completely removed, and the artist can paint freely. Alternatively, use clean hair, or a wad of flannel, or cloth-wrapped talc powder, or cuttlefish powder. Wiping with these is also effective. Later, tooth powder was used, which is more convenient. However, if one is not careful, the oil may be removed, but the powder will remain on the surface, which will be counterproductive. This is because ink mixed with powder will turn gray, so one must be careful. The simplest method, which can be done anytime, anywhere, is to use straw paper or maolu paper, etc. Any domestic paper with cotton fiber will clean the surface with a single wipe, without the need for powder.

(2) Flattening: Once the oil stains are removed and one is ready to paint, the fan board is the most important tool. The most common type is rectangular, with three spiral screws that can be adjusted to any size. This is the most suitable. If you find it too expensive, you can make your own. Take a piece of plywood and, according to the size of the fan surface, draw a fan shape, or slightly larger on all sides. Then, using a copper wire saw, cut off the four corners according to the pattern. Purchase three steel paper clips, the tighter the better. Choose those with stronger springs. In this way, a simple fan board is made. Thick cardboard can also be used to make your own. If you are in a hurry and cannot find a fan board, there are two very simple methods that can be used. One is to fold the fan surface along the creases in reverse, which can also flatten it. The other is to use an electric iron to iron it. These two methods are only used in emergencies and are not ideal.

(3) Hand Rest: When painting in summer, there will inevitably be sweat on the wrist. When putting the brush down, it is best to place a thin cloth on the right side of the fan surface to rest your hand, so that there will be no sweat stains when moving from left to right or from right to left.

(4) Corrections: If there is an occasional mistake, or if the inscription is incorrect, do not scribble or wipe it randomly, as this will damage the fan surface and make it impossible to remedy. There is a wonderful method: take high-quality cigarette ash (cigar ash is even better), dip it with a clean brush, and apply a small amount to the mistake. Then, dip it with clean water and gently let it flow, and it will be removed, leaving no trace and being very convenient. However, do not use too much force, and it is best not to damage the alum on the surface, otherwise, if the alum is removed, the use of ink and color will leave traces and damage the fan surface.

(5) Seals: If a seal is accidentally stamped upside down, or if the fan surface is stained with ink paste, you can gently wipe it off with a soft white eraser. After stamping the seal, when folding the fan, the fingers may rub against it, causing it to blur easily. You can mix cinnabar powder with Ming glue and apply it evenly. This will make the color bright and beautiful and prevent it from blurring easily.

(6) Leaks: When painting rainy landscapes or large-scale splashed ink flowers, etc., one often becomes very excited and disregards everything, seeking momentary gratification. But after the ink dries, one discovers that it has penetrated the back of the paper. What will you do at this point? If the back has not been written on, people will not want to write on it. If it has already been written on, wouldn't it be soiling someone else's calligraphy? This would be embarrassing for the other person and put yourself in an awkward situation. This is what is meant by being bold when putting down the brush but careful when cleaning up. After putting down the brush, if you see a large amount of ink accumulating in the creases of the fan surface, quickly absorb it with a dry brush to prevent problems. This is because the back is often stained because the alum on the surface has been soaked for too long, and the fan surface has become leaky and defenseless, so the water will naturally seep to the back. This point is also unavoidable, and beginners must pay attention to it.

(7) Composition: The composition of flowers, etc., on a fan surface is no different from other framed paintings. However, for landscapes and figures or birds used as secondary elements, one must be careful. This is because the fan surface is semi-circular, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom. If you paint landscapes or secondary elements according to the semi-circular shape, adding them gradually from left to right, you will unknowingly make a big mistake by the time the entire painting is finished. This is because the distant mountains, the near slopes, and the horizon will all be curved, which is ridiculous. Beginners often make this mistake. In short, before painting, do not regard it as a fan surface, but as a framed painting. The fan surface is just a framed painting cut into a fan shape. You must start with the overall composition, and you will never go wrong, and you can paint freely. However, inscriptions are different. You cannot regard them as writing straight across a framed painting. If you write straight, you must write according to the slope of the folds, which is larger at the top and smaller at the bottom, to be aesthetically pleasing. If you write horizontally, you must write according to the arc of the edge, to be aesthetically pleasing and appropriate. Although this is a small detail, it is of great importance.

### Ode to a Broken Fan

— Zhou Kun

The summer heat lingers, the scorching sun blazes, sweat flows down the back, and qi stagnates. What is most valued on such a day? This fan, of course! The craftsman displays his skill, focusing on the paper. Bamboo is used to make the frame, and images are created to convey meaning. When the corner moves, the breeze dispels the heat, allowing one to calm the mind and spend the day peacefully. But when the fan breaks, it can no longer block the heat or produce wind, and one cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy. I once read Xu Ni's poem on a broken fan, which says, "It cannot block the sun completely, and the wind it creates is only half as cool. It is not like Peng Qiao's smile, but it still stirs the fragrance of clothes." Ma Shi's poem on a broken fan says, "Who painted the girl riding an oriole in the moon? Purple bamboo and silver silk hold up white silk. It has not yet come to autumn, but the light is already broken. It must have been exposed to too much wind before." After reading these, I sighed deeply. The people are close to the suffering of boiling water and scorching stones, unable to escape. Who will present a letter of introduction and take hold of the fan, swaying it gently to create a breeze everywhere? Looking to the left, one feels cool; looking to the right, one feels cool. Abandoning worries is like being in an ice room, and everyone will happily express their gratitude, saying, "The people of the scorched earth have been relieved of their distress, all thanks to you!"

We have received many submissions for this "Fan Special." In addition to the articles published today, the remaining articles will be published in the coming days. John

### Ode to the Fan

— John

Tune: Butterfly Loves Flowers

Drawing in coolness and serving as a convenient screen; its elegant reputation has been passed down through the ages. It forms a connection difficult to unravel, often providing convenience in leisure.

Flattery and bragging cheapen its value. Welcoming summer and discarding spring (winter), it happily embraces the fiery heat. Don't say that ice mountains can be relied on for long; its fate still follows the swallows on carved beams.

### A Discussion on Collecting Fans

— Zhang Xiaocang

Everyone knows that the painting and calligraphy on fans should be emphasized when collecting them. However, rubbings of inscriptions on bronze and stone, brick patterns, and Buddhist images are also interesting.

The beauty of the fan bones is also appreciated by fan collectors. There are water-polished bamboo, carved bamboo, mottled bamboo, plum bamboo, mottled bamboo, rosewood, ebony, sandalwood, plain bamboo, tortoiseshell, ivory chicken wings, and various lacquer bones. However, old ones are valued more. People in Jiangnan do not value the fan support at the bottom of the fan bones. Therefore, the Rongbaozhai and Qingbiget in the capital often have specialized fan support makers (named Chen Zihe, the best craftsman in the capital) make mouse supports from tortoiseshell and other materials, which are sturdy and not easily damaged. Shanghai fan shops have recently been producing fan surfaces and fan bones crudely and carelessly. Who still cares about the fan support? It is regrettable to talk about this.

In the past, fan surfaces valued gold leaf. The Ming Dynasty fan pages in my collection have bright red gold that is dazzling and lovely. In the past, I have collected many fan surface albums and pages, and I always prefer old gold leaf fans. In the past, there were still commodity fan surfaces available. The inner layer of the fan surface was printed with the words "Respectfully made by a certain governor of Zhejiang," and its quality was not comparable to today's ordinary fan surfaces.

Calligraphers and painters often regard writing or painting on fan bones as a long and difficult task, because the fan bones are slightly uneven, unlike paper, which can be spread out flat and painted on at will. Therefore, a certain bamboo carver in the capital first photographs the calligraphy and painting of famous artists, then makes a printing plate, and then applies a kind of chemical to the printing plate. The chemical changes can be used to reprint the calligraphy and painting onto the fan bones, without any distortion from the original calligraphy and painting. He then engages in carving, which is more splendid than the few strokes casually made by calligraphers and painters on fan bones. This is also a method that bamboo carvers should learn from.

### Lecture at the 37th Literary Tea Party: Methods of Sketching in Chinese Painting

— Lecture by Yu Jianhua, recorded by Ruo Qu

Painting is essentially a visual art, so it must draw from nature. To draw from nature, one must sketch. Therefore, regardless of the differences between Chinese and Western painting methods, sketching is the starting point for both. Chinese painting in the Tang and Song dynasties was all about sketching. Historical records confirm this. Wu Daozi wanted to capture the entirety of the Jialing River landscape, so he traveled to the Jialing River by boat. Wang Wei lived in Lan Chuan and painted the Lan Chuan landscape. Jing Hao and Guan Tong painted the northern landscape, Dong Yuan and Ju Ran painted the southern landscape, Mi Fu painted the southern Xu landscape, and Ma Yuan and Xia Gui painted the eastern Zhejiang landscape. Horse painters took hundreds of thousands of horses as their teachers, and cattle painters could paint the reflection of a herdsboy in the cow's eyes. Flower painters went to the steps in front of the house to describe the shapes of flowers swaying in the wind and glistening with dew, with buds ready to burst. Figure painters not only captured the appearance of people, but also conveyed their spirit and temperament.

The trend of sketching in Chinese painting gradually changed in the Yuan Dynasty. Although Huang Gongwang also painted the Fuchun Mountains and Wang Meng also painted the Tiaoxi Mountains, due to the development of literati painting, painters focused on brushwork and ink interest, transcendence and charm, and neglected the basic work of sketching. At the same time, because there were more and more paintings in the world, it was much easier for painters to paint based on paintings than to paint based on nature. It is human nature to love ease and hate labor. Therefore, copying ancient paintings became popular in the art world, and no one paid attention to sketching from life. This trend became extremely popular in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Painters only knew about the ancients and did not know about nature. The trend of copying became more and more prevalent, and the art of painting declined more and more. Paintings became nothing more than repetitive, monotonous, and lifeless reproductions. Without sketching and without creation, some modern people have said that there was no theory of painting for three hundred years in the Qing Dynasty. It is not that there was no painting in the Qing Dynasty, but that there were no truly creative and lively paintings. Ninety-nine percent of all paintings were either "a disciple copying a teacher" or a teacher copying the ancients.

After five or six hundred years of the Ming and Qing dynasties, painters only studied methods of copying and no one was willing to learn methods of sketching. By now, methods of sketching have long been lost. Therefore, if we want to study methods of sketching in Chinese painting, we are at a loss as to where to start. Fortunately, modern Western painting has been introduced, and we can first learn Western sketching methods as a foundation and then move on to sketching in Chinese painting. This is because the methods of sketching in Western and Chinese painting are fundamentally different. Western painting methods are easier than Chinese painting methods, so we can borrow them first.

Sketching in Western painting requires a fixed point of view. The painter's viewpoint and horizon must be at a certain height, and the painter must be at a certain distance from the natural object. One cannot look left and right, nor can one move forward and backward. One must also be limited by time and light. A scene sketched in Western painting at nine o'clock in the morning can only be painted until ten o'clock. By noon, the sunlight has completely changed, and one must start a new painting. Therefore, Western painting must either be done outdoors or in a studio with artificial light. Therefore, it is said that Western painting is fixed and analytical, strictly limited by perspective, and a concrete and temporary phenomenon in which natural objects are reflected in the eye and reflected on the drawing surface. After learning this method, one can then apply it to sketching in Chinese painting, because Chinese painting is not limited by time, light, or perspective. The painter also does not have a fixed point of view, and there is not necessarily a horizon on the painting. For example, to paint Mount Huang, the painter walks from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain, from the back of the mountain to the left and right sides of the mountain, and integrates the entire shape of Mount Huang in the chest, omitting its trivial details and taking its essence. Then, back at home, the painter expresses the impression in the chest on paper. Therefore, one painting (such as my painting Huangshan Grand View) can be painted from Tianmenkan to Tiandu Lianhua, and from Wenshu Monastery to Lion Grove. This is the strength of sketching in Chinese painting, which Western painting cannot do. Therefore, sketching in Chinese painting is a holistic, permanent, and comprehensive impression. Saying it is painting Mount Huang, but it is not a realistic representation of Mount Huang, with every tree, every rock, and every mountain looking like a photograph. Saying it is not Mount Huang, but those who have been to Mount Huang can recognize Tiandu, Lianhua, Wenshu, and Lion Grove at a glance. This method of being both close and distant, neither identical nor dissimilar, extracting the essence and taking the spirit, is the strength of Chinese painting, and it is what makes art art. However, this method cannot be achieved overnight. It requires traveling thousands of miles, seeing all the famous mountains and rivers in the world, accumulating twenty or thirty years of technical practice, and then combining it with the brush and ink methods of the ancients, seasoned with the erudition of reading thousands of books, before there is hope of success. Although I have aspirations in this regard, my gains are still shallow. I hope that experts will not hesitate to give me advice.

### A Record of the "All Under Heaven is at Peace" Broken Tile

— Zhong Gongpei

The creation of tiles originated very early. With the rise of the construction of palaces and houses, the need for and invention of tiles arose in response to the times. Later, due to the development of culture, there was a demand for beauty and aesthetic pleasure in addition to daily use. Thus, the system of ornamentation arose. Simple and rustic patterns, designs, or words were applied to the tiles to enhance them. Although there were creations in every era, the Qin and Han dynasties are considered the most prosperous, and the Warring States and Han dynasties are considered the most refined. When we look at the simple, vigorous, and powerful characters and the elegant, rustic designs on the tile ends of the Qin and Han dynasties, we cannot help but feel a deep affection for them. No wonder their fame resonates throughout ancient and modern times, and broken bricks and broken tiles are regarded as treasures by antique collectors.

The earliest record of tile ends is found in Wang Guan's "Yan Shui Yan Tan Lu" of the Song Dynasty (which records the discovery of Qin Wugong's Yuyang Palace tiles by a commoner named Quan in Baoji County in the sixth year of the Song Yuan Dynasty, which was the beginning of the attention paid to the excavation of tile ends). Over the centuries, secret treasures have been unearthed day by day. Those who were once buried in the wilderness and dust are now classified as a type of metal and stone and have entered the realm of art and archaeology.

On the morning of July 7th of this year, I went to Zhongshan Park for a walk and found several broken tile ends among the rubble on the foothills of the mountain behind the National Art College. I brought them back to clean them up. The next day I went back to search and found several more in the accumulated soil near the area. Although the objects were broken, their style and pattern were quite ancient. Among them, the "All Under Heaven is at Peace" tile (see picture) was the most unique. I made a special study of it, which I believe scholars of this field will also be happy to discuss.

Upon close examination, the tile is made of fine soil, and the color is slightly bluish-white. The fire has been completely removed, which is probably due to being buried in the soil for a long time. Its shape is slightly rounded, which is commonly known as a flying eaves tile, or what was called a half-tile in the Han Dynasty. The tile has two sizes: the larger one is about 12 cm long and 18 cm wide and 2 cm thick, and the smaller one is about 10 cm long, 17 cm wide and 1 cm thick. In the center of the tile is engraved a strange head resembling a pixiu, ferocious and terrifying, rustic and quite spirited, which is very similar to the engraving on the Liang Tongtai Temple tile end unearthed in Nanjing before the war. Below it are three wavy curves extending from one end of the tile to the other. In the two corners on the left and right of the head are engraved the four characters "All Under Heaven is at Peace" in regular script. The characters are quite simple and vigorous. Either the characters "All Under Heaven" are on the left, or the characters "is at Peace" are on the left, and their sizes are also different, which is probably due to being produced by several patterns. Furthermore, comparing the characters and soil quality of this tile with those of the Leifeng Pagoda tile, there are many similarities, so it is probably an object from the Five Dynasties period. After surveying the land, it is located behind the Zhaodan Platform (the former site of the Zhuangdan Platform of the current Art College), which is the former site of the Agate Slope mentioned in the Song Dynasty. Furthermore, according to the "Lake and Mountain Handbook" Volume 2: "The Agate Baosheng Fire Prevention Wall, built by Qian of Wuyue during the Three Qi of the Jin Dynasty, rebuilt by monk Xiyuan during the Xiangfu reign of the Song Dynasty ...; in Shaoxing, the Xiangguan was moved to Geling, and the Zhaogong Pavilion was built at the site in the Ming Dynasty." It can be seen that the site was originally the site of the Agate Baosheng Temple. Furthermore, after examining the annals of Wu Yue, since King Wusu used the Tang calendar at the end of his reign, and after Tang Dynasty perished, and Jin Shijingtang stole the country, the annual stone carvings and other records often did not record the state name, only the year and month. This was because they had already recognized the Central Plains calendar, but avoided mentioning the state name. The "All Under Heaven is at Peace" tile is very likely to be an artifact of the Baosheng Temple. The text "All Under Heaven is at Peace" actually has the meaning of fearing to decorate the Wu Yue era.

There are many other broken tiles, all of which are engraved with elegant patterns, or in the shape of swirling clouds, or in the shape of water waves, or in the shape of double-curved quadripole, all different. Among them, the sunflower relief is the most outstanding and is also likely to be an object from the same period. In addition, there are still many three-colored (yellow, green, black) glazed tiles from the Qing Dynasty Shengyin Temple and tile ends left over from the Ming and Qing dynasties. These will be introduced in another article. I will not elaborate on them here. (Recorded in July at Wenlan Pass in West Lake)

### "Awkward"

— Zhu Wen

Zi Ti's farewell poem asks about illness: "Actions and hiding are both awkward, returning to the wind and waves." Han Yu's Qughe Station poem: "Relatives suddenly become awkward, diagrams and history are abandoned." Luo Yin's poem Burning Books and Burying Scholars: "The First Emperor's calculations were all awkward, thinking that poetry and books could save people." The two characters "awkward" were used by Yu Xin in his poem: "The turban has long been awkward, the chrysanthemum path has been briefly passed." It is said that "awkward" is similar to "eccentric," which is a colloquialism.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 379

— Ye Jingfeng

"You, uh..." Yaoqun pondered slightly; "You know, we came from inside the pass, and this journey was already difficult enough; who knew things would change in such a fresh way again; it's not worth it if we've already traveled nine and a half stages out of ten, and then something else comes up when we get to the old stronghold! ... What should we do..."

"Good, you, uh,... Tong the host understands what Yaoqun intends, "Only then did he relax the pair of furrowed, thick eyebrows:" After all, you are the educated one. Whatever you say, that's what I'll do."

"Don't rush, just send two experienced "Zhao Zi" (scouts) ahead for a stage, both to notify our hidden sentries along the way to be vigilant, and to check if the road is clear; if it's clear, they can go all the way to the old stronghold; notify the stations along the way to prepare horses; in case the road isn't so clear, have them send one person back as quickly as possible to warn us, so we can prepare. We here will still follow your plan, and set off at exactly twelve o'clock... (Zhao Zi means scout, the name for reconnaissance in the Baozhong Bureau, bandits call the same job 'Panzi'.)

"Truly capable, you are!" Tong the host raised a hand and gave a thumbs up: ""Caution is never wrong," that's what's admirable!..."

"You know," Yaoqun continued: "Neither Tiger Brother nor I are afraid of trouble. However, this time is a bit special, the matter is too important, we must be careful, ...... Moreover, we don't want to cause trouble for the old stronghold..." (370)

At midnight, twelve o'clock, everything was arranged properly, and the two boarded the car and set off. In less than ten minutes, the car was already on the highway, so it increased speed and drove like the wind. Along this highway, the old stronghold had originally set up many hidden sentries and five small stations, each station living in a different location, but all connected to the old stronghold. The first, second, third, and fifth stations were farther away, and the most rugged and difficult to travel. The fourth station was the shortest, and the road was the flattest. Because it was easy to travel, the people of the old stronghold didn't often use it, except for urgent matters; for fear of attracting attention.

This time, Yaoqun's journey was taking a steady approach; so he planned to take the fourth station; one, to save some time; and two, it had been many days since he had personally driven the reins, and he had pampered himself. Moreover, the livestock and horses of the old stronghold were all spirited and fierce dragons, not easy to control, and if the journey was too rugged, it would be dangerous. However, although the plan was set, it also depended on the movements of the two scout ahead, to see what they found along the way, before a final decision could be made.

The car drove to the first small station, and the several hidden sentries passed along the way all gave the "safe" signal. Although the station wasn't far away, a sentry line rode up on horseback, saw the signal emitted by the car lights, turned the horse around, followed beside the car, and delivered the message, knowing that the two scouts ahead were doing things smartly; as soon as they arrived at the station, they ordered horses to be prepared for Yaoqun and Tiger, and also sent a subordinate from the small station to travel the first station's route, to scout the way ahead; after giving the orders, they went to scout the second station. Yaoqun heard this, saw that the scouts were so thorough, and was extremely satisfied, so he ordered the car to go to the second station.

### Inquiries from Readers: Making a Living Away from Home Year-Round; Child Bride Elopes with Someone; The Evil Consequences of the Old Marriage System

Editor:

I am from a rural village in Tang Township, and farming is my occupation. When I was eleven years old, my father, out of love for his son, arranged a child bride to come to our home. At that time, the girl was only six years old. When I turned sixteen, I went out to study, and except for returning home for the New Year, I was away all year round. Now, she has reached adulthood and can get along with my family peacefully, without any misbehavior. Because of economic pressure, I was unable to get married. This spring, I received a letter from home informing me that she had run away with someone, taking belongings with her. Initially, there was no news, but recently I learned that she is living with someone. The rural culture is closed, and this is considered a great disgrace. She was raised by my family since she was a child. If there was discord between us, we could have terminated the arrangement. Why resort to such measures? I now have several questions and would like to ask for your answers: (1) What crime has the child bride committed by running away with belongings? (2) If pursuing her in another county, is it necessary to handle the matter in that county? (3) If she repents and returns, can we refuse to accept her? (4) If it is not clear that she has a new love, but she is already living with someone, can we sue that person for seduction? (5) In addition to recovering the stolen items, can we demand compensation for all past living expenses?

Li Wei

[Answer from Lawyer Jiang Ma Fan] (1) Running away with belongings can be prosecuted for theft. (2) If fleeing to another county, you can prosecute in that county. (3) Since the two parties are not formally married and do not have the status of husband and wife, whether to accept her if she repents in the future is up to you. (4) If the child bride is a minor and elopes to live with someone, her guardian can sue the cohabitant for interference with the family. (5) Stolen items can be recovered according to the law, but all past living expenses cannot be claimed.
